The design is unlikely to get anyone’s pulse racing – but the price tag probably will.

This is the £1 bra, which goes on sale today at budget chain Poundworld. And while it may lack the style and sex appeal of costlier rivals, it is expected to fly off the shelves.

Trials of the ‘comfort bra’ in selected shops last weekend proved a huge success, with almost 100,000 snapped up in hours.

Tried and tested: The new bra has been trialled in selected stores and will go on sale nationwide today

Now store bosses are expecting to sell
 one million by introducing the design in more than 200 branches 
nationwide, where it will be sold alongside their more established 
ranges of sweets, toys and toiletries.

The bra comes in black, white and nude
 nylon and sizes range from medium to extra large.

The manufacturer 
claims the curve-hugging design gives women the perfect fit and a smooth
 shape with no bumps or lumps.

Courtney Wallis, 21, who modelled one 
of the bras, said: ‘The material was so soft and it was surprisingly 
comfortable to wear. I wouldn’t wear one on a night out but it would be 
perfect under a T-shirt.’

However, comments from customers who 
have already bought them were mixed.

Support: Although only available in nylon, it comes in black, white and natural tone and sizes range from medium to extra large and claims to help posture and chaffing

‘They are so thin that you can see 
right through it so can only wear it under a dark top, fairly 
comfortable though,’ said one on Twitter.

Still, whether it does anything for 
your figure or not, the bra will certainly give your wallet a boost, 
with Poundworld boasting that it’s £14 cheaper than the lowest-priced 
Marks & Spencer rival.

The retailer admits it will make a loss on 
the product, but hopes it will lure more women into its stores.

However, it cannot claim to be the 
cheapest bra to go on sale in the UK. Two years ago, the 99p Stores 
chain sold a padded bra with decorative bow in 150 branches nationwide.
