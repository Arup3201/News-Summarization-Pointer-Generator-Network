In Hollywood films, the ‘odd-couple’ often manages to muddle through their differences to enjoy happy lives.

But a new study claims that in real life, couples in which one person is lazy, adopt the standards of the lazier person.

Individuals in so-called mis-matched relationships - where one person has high self-control and the other very little - often become unhealthy and fritter away their life savings, experts said.

The odd couples: Unlike the happy ending of Hollywood film 'Knocked Up' - Katherine Heigel and Seth Rogen as Alison and Ben are pictured - individuals in mis-matched relationships where one person has high self-control and the other very little, often become unhealthy and fritter away their life savings, experts said

The ability to resist anything from an extra slice of cake to a spending splurge is one of the keys to happier living, according to a 2013 study.

Researchers at the University of Chicago found that levels of self-control and life satisfaction were inextricably linked after analysing self-report surveys completed by 414 adults.

Instead of agonising over whether to indulge in something, those with strong willpower simply found it easier to make the right choices while those who gave into vices were plagued with regret.

Study co-author Kathleen Vohs of the University of Minnesota, said people with greater self-restraint are, in essence setting themselves up to be happy.

This is apparently because they learn how to 'avoid problematic desires and conflict.'

This is rarely a happy outcome in mis-matched relationships such as Alison and Ben's in the film ‘Knocked Up,’ where opposites attract and one person can be motivated by the other’s success.

Scientists from the Carroll School of Management at Boston College found that couples with mis-matched levels of self-control and motivation adopt the same level of indulgence as couples made up of two slackers.

Hristina Dzhogleva and Cait Poyner Lamberton studied a number of married couples and pairs of students to examine self-control decisions of couples with high self-control, couples with low self-control and those made up of one person who is good at exercising self-restraint and one person who gives into temptation easily.

They looked at the behaviour of the couples in the lab as well as at coffee mornings and in online forums, ABC News reported.

Unsurprisingly, the scientists found that couples made up of two people with impressive self-control ate healthy diets, saved money and rarely got into debt and the opposite was true of lazy couples who give into temptation.

But the joint decisions of mis-matched couples closely resembled those of the lazy couples.

‘Maintaining the relationship is more important for the high self-control partner than sticking to their guns,’ said Ms Dzhogleva.

‘As a result, mixed dyads [mis-matched couples] may end up with worse long-term health and financial outcomes than they may expect.’

While it might sound like an unhappy outcome for such couples is inevitable, Ms Dzhogleva thinks mis-matched couples can have a Hollywood-style happy ending if high self-control individuals in relationships are aware of their tendencies to give in and the people with low self-control compromise.

These couples often get fat and fritter their savings away

One expert believes this is because maintaining the relationship is more important for the high self-control partner than sticking to their guns
