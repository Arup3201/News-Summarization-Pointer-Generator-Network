A senior Conservative has taken a swipe at former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell, saying he does not ‘come up smelling of roses’  over Plebgate.

Michael Fabricant, vice-chairman of the party, said he thought the truth was ‘six of one and half a dozen of the other’, with neither the police’s nor the MP’s version of events entirely to be believed.

And he said that if Mr Mitchell had been known for being ‘invariably polite and courteous’, fewer people would have believed the claims against him.

The intervention underlines the fact 
that Mr Mitchell may not be able to count on Tory colleagues to regain 
his place in the Cabinet.

He resigned in October after Downing 
Street police accused him of calling them ‘plebs’ when they refused to 
let him take his bike out of the main gates. He has admitted swearing at
police, but denied calling them offensive names.

Last week, newly released CCTV coverage appeared to cast doubt on the police version.

And at the weekend, Mr Mitchell said he was the victim of a plot to ‘toxify’ the Tories.

‘These awful toxic phrases which were 
hung round my neck for weeks and weeks in a sustained attempt to toxify 
the Conservative Party and destroy my career were completely and totally
untrue,’ he said.

Mr Fabricant’s tweets about the 
Mitchell affair began last Thursday, when he wrote: ‘While the police 
must be “banged to rights” if any evidence was falsified, I am uneasy 
with anti-police chat in Commons corridors and bars.’

And on Saturday, just before Mr 
Mitchell’s newspaper claims, he tweeted: ‘I gather we can look fwd to a 
real tear jerker (5,000 words) written by A Mitchell in the Sunday 
Times. The Pope is preparing to beatify him.’

On Christmas Eve, Mr Fabricant cast doubt on both accounts of the incident.

‘I suspect the truth is six of one and half a dozen of the other,’ he wrote.

‘No one comes out of it smelling of roses: neither the police nor Andrew.’

He pointed out that the CCTV footage 
broadcast last week by Channel 4 News lasted 46 seconds, while the words
recalled by Mr Mitchell would take about 20 seconds to  say. He asked 
what had happened in the missing seconds.

He added: ‘The problem Andrew Mitchell
has is that if Michael Gove had been accused, it would be hard to 
believe. He is invariably polite and courteous.’

He defended the police, deploring any 
‘witch hunt’ against them. He said: ‘If Andrew Mitchell was stitched up 
by the police, it is unforgivable. But will we ever know exactly what 
was said and by whom?’

Scotland Yard boss Bernard Hogan-Howe 
has taken charge of the Plebgate investigation, amid claims from senior 
Tories that he had been ‘completely compromised’ by the police 
‘stitch-up’ of Mr Mitchell.
