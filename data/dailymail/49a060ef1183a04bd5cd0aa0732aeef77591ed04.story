This bird looks to have bagged herself a decent looking dinner after spearing a large fish on the end of her beak.

The female Anhinga caught her unfortunate prey while hunting for
food in the Everglades National Park, in Florida.

She eventually managed to free the fish from the end of her beak before gulping it down in one go.

What a catch: A female Anhinga - commonly known as a 'snake bird' bird - bagged herself a decent dinner after spearing this fish while hunting in the Everglades National Park, Florida

The amazing image was captured on camera by husband and wife photography team Alfred and Fabiola Forns.

Mrs Forns said Anhingas, which are known as 'snake birds' in South Florida because of the way their necks look in the water, are particularly efficient at fishing.

'When we see one of them dive, we just wait, because it will not be long before it has a catch,' she said.

'They spear the prey, then surface, flip
it and swallow it.

'If the fish has a strong spine, they seem to know it
and bring it to shore and bang it against a rock or a tree, until they 
consider it's ready to eat.

'It's fascinating to watch, and an incredible moment to capture on camera.'

Anhingas are regularly seen in South Florida.
