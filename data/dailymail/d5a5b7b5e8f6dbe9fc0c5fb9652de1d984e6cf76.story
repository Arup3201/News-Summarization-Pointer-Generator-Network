A retired police officer is facing financial ruin after she bought her dream home at auction just a week before a landslide left it teetering on a cliff edge.

Sue Diamond, who is disabled, made a telephone bid of £154,500 for the house in Torquay in February 2010, without viewing it or having a survey done.

But just eight days after the auction, a landslide left the 1930s house just 50 yards from a drop into the sea, and signalled the started of a lengthy legal battle.

On the brink: Ridgemont House in Torquay where a huge chunk of the garden fell away from the cliff, six days after the house had been sold

Miss Diamond says the house is 
uninhabitable and worth only £3,500.

She has been engaged in a legal war
with the builder who sold it to her, Matthew Taylor, who has been 
reduced to living in a caravan while the dispute has dragged on.

The auction particulars warned buyers that the six-bedroom house was 
severely structurally damaged and might be beyond economic repair, and a
judge in 2010 ordered Miss Diamond to pay Mr Taylor what she owed.

Mr Taylor has a legal charge for the money, plus 8 per cent interest 
annually, over Miss Diamond’s home in Chiswick, West London, which she 
says is worth over £1million.

In December 2011, Miss Diamond was evicted from her home so it could be 
sold and Mr Taylor paid. However, London’s High Court heard that she 
later went back there despite what she described as its ‘uninhabitable 
state’.

The saga continued in March this year when a judge gave Mr Taylor 
permission to market the property at £650,000 – but that brought 
protests from Miss Diamond who said that was only half its true value.

Now Mr Justice Norris has given Miss Diamond the chance to get a better 
price for her home after she produced letters from estate agents saying 
£1.1million was ‘easily achievable’. Miss Diamond, the judge said, 
suffered from dyslexia, impaired hearing and restricted mobility.

Explaining her decision to buy the house in Torquay, she said her 
Chiswick home had been flooded by burst pipes and she thought the ground
floor of the seaside property would be ideal for a disabled person.
