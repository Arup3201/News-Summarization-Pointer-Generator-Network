When James Lusted walked into a restaurant for a romantic meal with his fiancee he expected to be handed a menu.

He didn’t think the waitress would also try to give him a children’s colouring book and some crayons.

Unfortunately the well-meaning Harvester employee had mistaken him for a child – because while 26-year-old Mr Lusted, who has dwarfism, is just 3ft 7in tall, his 20-year-old fiancee Chloe Roberts towers over him at 5ft 7in.

James Lusted, a 3ft 7in dwarf,  took his fiance Chloe Roberts, to a posh restaurant when he was given a children's colouring book and crayons 

The waitress was left red faced after realising her mistake when she handed Mr Lusted the children's colouring book and crayons on his meal out with his fiancée

It was only when the waitress heard Mr Lusted’s deep voice that she realised her mistake.

While she was covered in embarrassment, her gaffe was the highlight of the night for the couple who have been laughing about it ever since.

Mr Lusted said: ‘As I said thank you to the waitress for the menu she heard my voice and knew I wasn’t a child.

‘She immediately put the colouring book behind her back in shock. But I am man enough to see the funny side – I would never take offence.’ 

The couple who have been together for 18 months, had been enjoying a romantic meal out when the embarrassing blunder took place

They did not complain to the Harvester in Cardiff city centre and will visit again with no hard feelings

He and Miss Roberts did not complain to the Harvester in Cardiff city centre and will visit again with no hard feelings. 

The couple realise they make an unusual sight when they are out together in Cardiff, where she is a third-year education student. 

But they say their mis-matched heights make no difference to them and they are getting married in the summer of 2016.

Mr Lusted, of Colwyn Bay, North Wales, said: ‘Life has not been easy – when I was young I had a lot of surgery and went through a time of being bullied in school.

‘I have often thought from an early age, who would want to marry me, a dwarf? But then I met Chloe and everything just fell into place.’ 

A rare genetic condition called diastrophic dysplasia caused Mr Lusted’s dwarfism. Both his parents are of average height.

He works as a TV presenter, actor and motivational speaker. He also competed in the World Dwarf Games twice and played badminton at a national level.

Miss Roberts, also from Colwyn Bay, said: ‘All little girls dream about having their tall, dark and handsome Prince Charming. Never in my life did I think I’d date someone like James.

‘People sometimes get a bit confused when they see us for the first time but we always laugh it off. I felt a bit sorry for the waitress – she felt very uncomfortable.’

She added that she didn’t hesitate when Mr Lusted got down on one knee to propose. ‘There may be a two-foot height difference between us but when you are in love little things like that don’t matter,’ she said.

A spokesman for Harvester said: ‘We can’t apologise enough to James and Chloe, and are happy they have taken the error in good faith.’

Diastrophic dysplasia is a rare type of dwarfism.

The congenital disorder  is often characterised by short stature and with short arms and legs. 

It can also be associated with abnormal bone and joint development, curvature of the spine, clubfoot, cleft palate and swelling of the ear tissue.

It is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning both mother and father must carry the defective gene for a child to inherit the condition. Parents are not normally affected by the disorder.

Diastrophic dysplasia is caused by mutations in the SLC26A2 gene which alters the structure of developing cartilage, preventing bones from forming properly.
