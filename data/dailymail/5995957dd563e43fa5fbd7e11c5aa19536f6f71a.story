An 11-month-old baby from Essex has won a national competition to become the first professional Prince George lookalike.

Freddie Minnis, who was born just four days before the young prince, was picked from hundreds of hopefuls by a personalised baby gift retailer.

He's already modelled a so-called Crown Collection, launched in time for Prince George's first birthday on July 22, and will be seen in new ranges in the coming months.

Can you tell the difference between little Freddie (left) and Prince George?

The toddler was put forward by his mother Carly after family friends remarked on his uncanny resemblance to the royal Prince during the Cambridge's recent trip to Australia.

As well as looking like George, Freddie seems to share some of his characteristics.

He's a happy and laid back, loves being outside, adores animals - especially his pet dog Minnie - and is now starting to move around without too much help from mum and dad.

But the similarities between the Royal family and the Minnis family don't end there.

Carly and her husband Ross got engaged the same year as William and Kate, tied the knot five months after the couple and Freddie was born just four days before Prince George.

Carly said: 'I've always been a fan of the Royals and the similarities between my family and the Cambridge's is strange.

'I never noticed Freddie's resemblance to Prince George until I saw all the TV coverage during their recent visit to Australia and New Zealand. George was dressed in clothes similar to those Freddie wears and they seem to have the same temperament.

'Like George, Freddie moves around by himself although he's skipped the crawling and has gone straight to trying to walk, and just like the Prince, if he isn't doing what he wants, has a very cute pouty, sulky face. 

'He's also obsessed by our family dog Minnie, just like George appears to be with Lupo.

'I always 
dress Freddie in traditional-looking clothes when we're going out and 
adore some of the European baby clothes designers, just like Kate. 

'Freddie
 being selected as a Prince George lookalike seems almost natural. There
 are so many similarities between my family and the Royals that is seems
 fitting. All we need now is for Kate and William to have a daughter - 
Freddie would make a great real-life Prince.'

Daniel Price from My1stYears.com said: 'As soon as we saw the photos of Freddie we could see the resemblance instantly.

'Like the young prince he's a natural in front of the camera and was a pleasure to work with. 

'We had hundred of mums and dads contact us with pictures of their sons who resemble the Prince and it was tough to select just one. 

'The thing that made Freddie stand out was the closeness in age and the fact he's so similar to George in other ways too.'
