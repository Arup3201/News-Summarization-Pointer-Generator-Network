A high school student is suspected in the shooting deaths of two people on Monday.

Dean M. Sutcliffe, of Mazomanie, Wisconsin, is being held as a suspect in the deaths of a 16-year-old Ariyl Brady and and 39-year-old Chris Schwichtenberg.

The incident reportedly happened shortly after Amanda Brady, Ariyl's 15-year-old sister, told Sutcliffe she wanted to end their relationship.

Amanda was not present during the shooting.

According to NBC 15, Sutcliffe is believed to have armed himself with a gun taken from his home, and headed over the trailer park where Brady lived.

Three other people at the home, Brady's mother and two boys, ages 14 and 16, who were not harmed in the shooting.

Schwichtenberg was the mobile home park's manager since 2002 and was dating Mrs. Brady according to the Wisconsin State Journal. 

'Chris went to the door and from what I understand the kid just started shooting,' said Schwichtenberg's mother, Joyce Zimdars. 

'He was my only son,' Zimdars added. 

'Everybody around here loved him. He did everything he could for everybody, just like his father.' 

Sutcliffe, both Brady girls and the two boys all attended Wisconsin Heights High School.

Dane County Sheriff Dave Mahoney says deputies have had contact with Sutcliffe in the past, mostly over family matters, and that they will be charging the young man with two counts of first degree intentional homicide. 

He will appear in court on Thursday.
