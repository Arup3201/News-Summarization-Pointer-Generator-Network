Ordered to rest: Princess Alexandra of Kent

Princess Alexandra, the Queen’s cousin, has cancelled all her public appointments indefinitely due to ill-health.

The 76-year-old sister of the Duke of Kent, who carried out 110 engagements in 2012, has not been seen in public this year, including being absent from the 60th anniversary of the Queen’s Coronation.

The Princess is suffering from a form of arthritis that leads to stiffness in the joints and in some cases blindness, raising concerns about her ability to perform her Royal duties.

She is understood to be taking steroids to control the condition, but they can cause side effects including thinning of the bones and causing sufferers to develop a puffy or ‘moon’ face.

Buckingham Palace announced in April that the Princess, who is 42nd in line to the Throne, was being treated for polymyalgia rheumatica, and now a Palace spokeswoman has told The Mail on Sunday there are no plans for the Princess to carry out duties ‘for the foreseeable future’.

Her last engagement was  on December 20 when she attended a service to mark the 600th anniversary of the University of St Andrews at St Paul’s Cathedral.

The Princess, a granddaughter of King George V who lives in a Royal residence in Richmond Park, South-West London, is said to be ‘in good spirits’ but doctors have ordered her to rest.

She trained at Great Ormond Street Hospital, and is patron of various charities.

The Princess is said to be  keen to return to work, but her office staff have not yet been told when they can start organising her diary again.

A Palace spokeswoman said last night: ‘Her Royal Highness had a viral infection at the end of last year and was advised to rest. We do not know when she will next appear in public.’

In 1989, the Princess had a public row with her rebellious daughter Marina, who, when pregnant, claimed her parents insisted that she either had an abortion or a shotgun wedding.

Marina subsequently married fashion photographer Paul Mowatt before the birth of their daughter.

But there was a reconciliation after 2003 reports that Marina was living on benefits after her marriage collapsed.

Princess Alexandra’s husband, Sir Angus Ogilvy, died in 2004. She also has a son, James, and four grandchildren.
