A visible sign of the increasing leadership Gareth Bale has for Wales can be observed in the way he called team-mates together for a post-match huddle after clinching a vital win against Cyprus with 10 men on Monday.

Captain Ashley Williams did the talking once the bodies assembled but Bale now provides vocal support in the dressing room to add to his ability on the pitch. One day, Williams said, he could ‘definitely’ take over the armband.

‘I have someone next to me now who I can lean on,’ said Williams. ‘That really helps. He is definitely one of the leaders of the team and has grown into it. He has shown he is a leader on and off the pitch. It is not just my advice any more. There are at least two of us.

‘He called the huddle in and I said, “Remember this feeling of tiredness. We left it out there but we got what we came for. We focus now on Belgium.”’

It was a team effort to repel Cyprus for nearly the entire second half, a man down after Andy King’s red card, but Bale was the outlet for breakaways and time-consuming forays into the opponents’ half.

Having started as a No 10, he shifted into midfield, then a striking role as the clock ticked down. He took kicks from Cypriot boots. He led by example.

The victory means Wales head to Belgium next month top of Group B, and should have Aaron Ramsey, a former captain, back from a hamstring problem.

Given he is one of 12 players injured, the boost would be sizeable. He scored a late equaliser in Belgium last October as Wales, depleted by 15 injuries, finished the campaign on a positive note.

Manager Chris Coleman would take the same result again. ‘If we are going to do well in this campaign we have to go to Belgium and get a result,’ he said. ‘We are good enough to do that. I don’t know who is going to turn up, there are always injuries.

‘All I know is whoever we have got we can get a result in Belgium. I am not saying it flippantly, we did it last time when we had 15 players missing.’

When Bale is in your ranks, the odds on achieving a result grow markedly. Ryan Giggs has called him ‘one of the best ever’ players produced by Wales.

‘He can be as good as he wants to be because he’s such an amazing talent. He can go all the way,’ said Giggs. ‘He’s playing at a great club and he’s doing it week in week out and for Wales as well. He has to deliver at Real Madrid where the expectation is huge and he’s showing for Wales he can still deliver.

‘You don’t want to big him up too much but he’s looking like he can handle it all. He’s lived up to every expectation and more.

‘Not only that, he’s a great lad who wants to get better and wants to be the best.’

Giggs also believes Euro 2016 qualification is attainable for Wales. ‘There’s a long way to go but there is great potential,’ he added. ‘We have Gareth who is just a world class player who could walk into any team. There’s Aaron Ramsey and younger players coming through, and I think we can look forward to the rest of the campaign.’
