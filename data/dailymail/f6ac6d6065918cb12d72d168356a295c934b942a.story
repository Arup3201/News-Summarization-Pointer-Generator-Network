The mother of a Mississippi teen who was burned alive in her car has revealed the final words she spoke to her daughter as she lay dying in a hospital bed.

Lisa Daugherty rushed to her daughter Jessica Chambers' bedside in December 7 she lay dying with 98 percent of her body covered in burns.

Knowing their time together was short, Daughterty told 19-year-old Jessica to let go.

'I just looked at her and said, 'I know you're in pain, Baby, if you want to go, you can go.' 

Horrific: Jessica Chambers, 19, was burned alive in December by an unknown assailant. Her mother has since revealed her last moments with her daughter as she lay dying with burns on 98 percent of her body

Moments before she died: 'I just looked at her and said, 'I know you're in pain, Baby, if you want to go, you can go,' said Jessica's mom Lisa Daugherty

Then, says Daugherty, 'she took her last breath.'

Daugherty had also told Jessica her dad was there, too, though he was too stricken to see his daughter bandaged and dying. 

'Jessica, it's OK, Baby, Mama's here, and Daddy's in the waiting room. You know your daddy — he's a big, old baby and he can't come in here, but he's here. And we love you,'" Daugherty recalled to the Jackson Clarion Ledger‎. 

Months after her daughter's death, the gruesome crime remains unsolved. And Daugherty remains both haunted and comforted by Jessica's memory.

'The last words she said to me was, "I'm cleaning my car and getting something to eat and I'll be home." That was at 7 something that night, and I keep waiting on her to come home.' 

Mystery: Two months after Jessica's gruesome murder, authorities still have no clue who burned her alive in her Kia Rio sedan

Jessica was still alive when a passing motorist saw her lying near her burning Kia about 8:15pm December 7. She managed to tell paramedics something, but authorities won't say what

She was still alive when a passing motorist saw her lying near her burning Kia Rio sedan about 8:15pm December 7, and she spoke to rescue workers, District Attorney John Champion has said.

'We're not releasing what she said, but we're acting on it,' he said.

Authorities had as of January spoken to over 100 people without identifying a prime suspect the Clarion Ledger.   

State and federal law enforcement agencies are working together on the case.

Until there's a break in the case--which Daugherty firmly believes will come--the grieving mother says her daughter 'cannot rest.' 

'She knows who did this. She has told who did this,' Daugherty told WMC.

Before she died, Jessica Chambers went to a gas station and in surveillance video a person off-camera gestured toward her. She is seen here
