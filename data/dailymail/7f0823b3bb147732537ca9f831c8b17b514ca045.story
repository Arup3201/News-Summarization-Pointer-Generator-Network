A shocking new attack ad from the Obama camp blames Mitt Romney for a woman's cancer death after her husband's steel mill in Kansas City, Missouri, went bankrupt under Bain Capital.

The commercial, called 'Understands', is perhaps the harshest attack on the Republican presidential candidate to date. In the video, released online on Tuesday, steel worker Joe Soptic says Romney doesn't know what his private equity firm did to workers, 'and further, I don't think he's concerned.'

In a separate attack, the president also tarred Romney as 'Robin hood in reverse' for his economic plan that the Obama campaign says gives $5trillion in tax cuts to the wealthy at the expense of poor and middle class families.

Shocking: Laid-off steel worker Joe Soptic blames Mitt Romney for his wife's cancer death after Bain Capital shut down the mill where he worked

The ad was released by Priorities USA Action, the super PAC supporting the president's reelection campaign. Obama can officially disavow the attack by saying it was produced by an independent group, but the PAC is run by two former White House aides and close allies.

Mr Soptic worked for GST Steel, which was purchased by Romney's private equity firm Bain Capital. The company later went bankrupt and 750 workers lost their jobs, though Bain investors made millions of dollars off the deal.

Romney says the steel mill only went under after he left Bain. Obama's campaign says the investment in GST is fair game because the initial deal was struck while Romney was still at the helm.

In the ad, Mr Soptic says his wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer after he was cut from his job and lost health insurance for his family.

'I don’t know how long she was sick, and I think maybe she didn’t say anything because she knew that we couldn’t afford the insurance,' he says.

Dispute: Romney's experience at Bain Capital has been a source of exhaustive attacks by the Obama campaign in an effort to discredit the Republican challenger

'One day she became ill and I took her up to the Jackson County hospital and admitted her for pneumonia and that's when they found the cancer. By then it was stage four, there was nothing they could do for her and she passed away in 22 days.'

Mr Soptic ends the ad by saying: 'I do not think Mitt Romney realizes what he’s done to anyone, and furthermore I do not think Mitt Romney is concerned.'

Romney's campaign blasted the new spot as 'discredited, dishonest attacks.' A spokesman says Obama is trying to distract the American people from the sluggish economy and high unemployment rates.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the ad stand on very shaky ground, factually.

The steel company was acquired by Bain while Romney was at the helm, though it did not close until 2001 -- two years after Romney says he left the company.

Mr Soptic's wife dined in 2006, five years after the plant shut down.

Controversy: Many of the campaign volleys have centered around whether Bain created more jobs than it destroyed

The Priorities USA Action PAC has raised $20.7million as of June 30 and spent more than $17million on ads attacking Romney.

Restore Our Future, Romney's super PAC run two former aides, has raised $62million and spent $8.2million opposing Obama so far. It also spent nearly $40million bashing Romney's Republican primary challengers and $14million support the former Massachusetts governor.

On Monday Obama blasted Romney for his economic plan, which he says will raise taxes on the middle class and poor to pay for a $5trillion deduction for wealthy Americans.

'It's like Robin Hood in reverse -- it's Romney-hood,' he said.
