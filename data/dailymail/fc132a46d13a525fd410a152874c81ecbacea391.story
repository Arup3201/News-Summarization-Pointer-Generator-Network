With a demon baby Jesus, skeletal wise men and the carcass of a lamb, a zombie-themed nativity scene caused quite a stir when it was unveiled in Ohio earlier this month.

And now its creator, Jasen Dixon, has been ordered to kill the ten-foot by ten-foot structure because it violates local property maintenance codes.

The Cincinnati resident has been given until December 26 to dismantle the display otherwise he will be slapped with a $1,000 fine. 

Gruesome: Zombie-themed nativity scene caused quite a stir when it was unveiled in Ohio earlier this month

Underfire: Now its creator, Jasen Dixon, has been ordered to kill the ten-foot by ten-foot structure because it violates local property maintenance codes

Officials in Ohio's Sycamore Township said they received two anonymous complaints about the placement of the zombie nativity.

Regulations in the area state that structures  located in a front or  side yard should not occupy more than 35per cent of the area, and should be three feet from the street and six feet from the house.

Dixon, who manages a haunted attraction in Indiana, unveiled his unconventional creation three weeks ago.

He said he made the models for the zombie Mary and three wise men and borrowed props to make the Joseph and Jesus zombie figures.

The baby Jesus is pale with totally white eyes, while the other life-sized figures are partly skeletal.

Dixon said despite some backlash, many people approve of the display, which is lit by red and green lights. 

A Facebook page he made for it has attracted 200 'likes.'

He said that at around 2am on Tuesday, he discovered three women in his front yard taking selfies with the display in the pouring rain.

'I never suspected it to be this big,' Dixon said.

Greg Bickford, the township administrator, said the citation has nothing to do with the irreverent content of the display, which he called 'comical.' 

Rather it is to do with the size and location.

Sight for sore eyes: Dixon said his father and neighbors aren't fans of the zombie scene

'We’re complaint-driven,' Bickford said, when asked if other displays had been cited this season. 

'If we were to drive up and down every single street and try to find violations, we’d never get off a street.'

Dixon, who has lived in the neighborhood for 15 years and never received any other notices, was also cited for junk and debris on his property that he said was never an issue before.

He said he is still considering what to do with the manger scene by the township’s Friday deadline, the day after Christmas.

'I haven’t decided,' he said. 'I don’t really know what’s going to happen.'
