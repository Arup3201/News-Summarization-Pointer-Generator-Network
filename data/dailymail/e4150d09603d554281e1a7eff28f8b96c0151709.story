'The girl was predatory': Judge Nigel Peters, who allowed a paedophile to walk free after he admitted abusing a girl of just 13 years old

A judge allowed a paedophile to walk free after his 13-year-old victim was described as a 'sexual predator' who was 'egging him on' to engage in a sexual act.

Judge Nigel Peters told Neil Wilson, 41, who pleaded guilty to the abuse, he had also taken account the fact the child looked older.

Wilson lured the teenager to his home in Romford, Essex, where he watched her strip out of her school uniform before she performed a sex act on him.

The abuse did not come to light until the girl confided in a friend who then told police.

During a search of Wilson’s home officers also uncovered a stash of images and videos depicting child abuse and bestiality.

He admitted a string of charges but was handed a suspended sentence at Snaresbrook Crown Court.

Judge Peters told him: ‘You have come as close to prison as is imaginable.

‘I have taken in to account that even though the girl was 13, the prosecution say she looked and behaved a little bit older.

‘You knew she was not nearly 16 as she said and your plea of guilty recognises that you knew.

‘Allowing her to visit your home is something we have to clamp down on and in normal circumstances that would mean a significant term in prison.

‘On these facts, the girl was predatory and was egging you on.

‘That is no defence when dealing with children but I am prepared to impose a suspension.’

Wilson was handed an eight-month jail term, suspended for two years, and will also be supervised by the Probation Service for the next three years.

He has been banned from contacting children and must allow police to examine his computer, as well as attending a sex offenders’ programme.

Wilson met the schoolgirl when she asked him to buy cigarettes for her while she was playing truant.

He enjoyed a two-week ‘fling’ with his victim, during which he bombarded her with phone calls and text messages and she continued to visit his home, the court heard.

Guilty: Neil Wilson admitted at Snaresbrook Crown Court that he lured the teenager to his home in Romford, Essex, where he watched her strip out of her school uniform before she performed a sex act on him

Prosecutor Robert Colover, told the judge: ‘The girl is predatory in all her actions and she is sexually experienced.

‘She appeared to look around 14 or 15 and had the mental age of a 14 or 15 year old despite being younger than that.

‘There was sexual activity but it was not of Mr Wilson’s doing, you might say it was forced upon him despite being older and stronger than her.

‘As for the images, there were eight found of child pornography, four of which fall in to the category three.

‘There were also 11 images involving horses and dogs found on his computer.’

Wilson, now of York, pleaded guilty to two counts of making extreme pornographic images and one count of sexual activity with a child.
