For most people advancing in years,  old age is about donning a pair of comfy slippers and taking life at a steadier pace.

However, one group of mischievous seventysomethings, the stars of a new series of Channel 5 show OAPs Behaving Badly, are determined to rage against the stereotype.

Among those behaving badly is former popstar Lee Graham. The 75-year-old, who had a smash hit in 1968 with 'Little Arrows' under his stage name 'Leapy Lee', is refusing to put his carousing days to bed.

Give us a kiss! One-time sixties pop star Lee 'Leapy Lee' Graham admits growing old disgracefully with his Danish girlfriend Bettina, who he describes as 'very sexually active'

Living in Mallorca, Lee admits to sharing a saucy sex life with his much younger girlfriend Bettina, 49. 

The couple make it clear in the show that they are still very much full of life, with Danish Bettina at one point presenting her lover with a penis pump after visiting a sex shop. 

Lee said: 'Tina is a very sexually active young lady, she is quite fit and she's quite a big girl. She's just a very healthy young lady and I'm delighted to have her.

'I suppose you could meet ladies of your own age but 75 year old ladies are a lot different to 50 year old ladies.'

Lee admits to creaking bones but says his new lover has given him a fresh take on life. 

Singing to a different tune: Lee and Bettina argue over who has the most energy. She says her 75-year-old boyfriend is 'never tired' 

Having fun! Lee entertains locals in Mallorca with his old tunes and says: 'I think the game is to just, just make the most of it really'

He said: 'As far as age is concerned - I know that old cliché "it's just a number" - but it is just a number isn't it really?

'After meeting Bettina and everything it's like a bit of a new lease of life.'

It seems that there's life in the old dog yet. Bettina admits to often having trouble keeping up with her pension-age lover.

She said: 'I'm tired all the time he's not. He's almost never tired.'

Lee keeps busy by belting out his tunes to the ageing party animals in Spain and still has plenty of female admirers - something which turns Bettina green with envy.

He said: 'Over the years I suppose I've played to hundreds and hundreds and thousands of people, because I have been here thirty odd years.'

'I think as far as the future is concerned when you get to my age what's behind you gets longer and what's in front of you gets shorter.

'I think the game is to just, just make the most of it really.

'And with Bettina's help who knows.'

The series also follows the fortunes of other outrageous pensioners including swinging professor Colin and 'spiritual healer' Raimondo, who is on the hunt for a younger lover. 

OAPs Behaving Badly is on Channel 5 at 9pm on Wednesday March 25
