She is the celebrated yachtswoman who sailed her way into the record books 25 years ago.

Now Tracy Edwards has launched a bid to rescue the boat she used when leading the first all-female crew to the finish line of the Whitbread Round the World Race in 1990.

Miss Edwards made history and inspired a generation of female sailors when her team won two of the six legs on their way to completing the gruelling race.

Their 58ft yacht, called Maiden, was the unsung star of the race as it was already 21-years-old at the time and was self-funded by Miss Edwards.

But since the momentous event the yacht has had several owners and has fallen into a state of disrepair.

It is now abandoned and languishing in a marina on an island in the Indian Ocean.

Having recently discovered its plight Miss Edwards has launched a fundraising campaign to salvage the boat, bring it back to Britain and restore it to its former glory.

The campaign has gained support from a host of big names including Duran Duran singer Simon Le Bon and Virgin Media boss Richard Branson.

Now Miss Edwards, 50, hopes to reunite her former crew and re-enact their historic race finish 25 years ago by sailing Maiden up Southampton Water on May 28 next year.

The vessel will then go on display at maritime museums around Britain and also be used to take young people from charities sailing.

Miss Edwards, who was awarded the MBE and named Sportswomen of the Year in 1990, needs to raise £50,000 to ship Maiden, pictured, to Cape Town where it will be refitted and then sailed to the UK

Miss Edwards, who was awarded the MBE and named Sportswomen of the Year in 1990, needs to raise £50,000 to ship the boat to Cape Town where it will be refitted and then sailed to the UK.

She said: ‘When we formed the Maiden crew I had to take out a mortgage just to buy the boat.

‘I had no choice but to sell her at the end of the race which was very sad. I sold her to someone who looked after her well but she was then passed to someone who didn’t.

In 1985 Miss Edwards became the very first woman to take part in the Whitbread Round the World Race, now the Volvo Ocean Race.

Afterwards she began assembling an all-woman crew and bought a boat called Prestige, which was refitted and renamed Maiden by the Dutchess of York in 1988.

A year later Maiden was among 22 boats which started the race from Southampton.

Many doubted an all-woman crew could compete with male crews but Miss Edwards led her team to second overall in her class.

In 1999 after the birth of her daughter, Mackenna, she retired from yacht racing and in 2001 she managed Maiden II the first ever mixed professional racing crew aboard a Maxi Multihull.

They broke the Trans Atlantic and 24-hour records in 2002. In 2003 she signed a £6 million sponsorship deal with Qatar Sports International (QSI) and moved her family and team to Doha.

In recent years she has founded a training company and is a sought after motivational speaker.

Miss Edwards, 50, now lives in London with her 14-year-old daughter Mackenna and runs a company providing advice on internet and travel security.

‘I have kept an eye on her for many years and it has been heartbreaking seeing her gradually rot away unloved.

‘I got an email from someone saying they had found Maiden in a marina on an island in the Indian Ocean.

‘She had been there for a few years and was in a terrible state looking like she had just been dumped.

‘I contacted the marina which had seized her after her last owner disappeared. The staff got in touch with me and asked if I would like her.

‘I’ve gone from swearing that I would never set foot on another boat as long as I live to facing the prospect of resurrecting Maiden and sailing her again.

‘I can’t even start to think what it will be like to spend a month on the old girl bringing her home from Cape Town, let alone sailing into Southampton with the original crew.'

She added: 'The Maiden campaign was so much more than just a group of women proving they could race around the world.

'It became a symbol for anyone inspired to achieve something amazing. We weren’t a big budget boat and we had to scrimp and save to make it happen.

'With a little bit of TLC we can restore Maiden to her former splendour and our hope is she can inspire countless people to sail. There is still plenty of life left in Maiden.'
