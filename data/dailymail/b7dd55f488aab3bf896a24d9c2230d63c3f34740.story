A veteran marine committed suicide on Saturday as he struggled to cope with post-traumatic stress disorder following tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Lance-corporal Janos Victor Lutz, a decorated machine gunner known as Johnny, took an overdose in his childhood bedroom on January 12.

The 24-year-old killed himself in Davie, Florida just hours after discussing his studies at Palm Beach State College over lunch with his mother.

The 24-year-old, who had been discharged 18 months ago, left a final note on his laptop which read: 'I'm sorry. I am happier now.'

Mr Lutz is the latest in a long list of U.S. servicemen to have taken their own lives. Last year alone, some 349 troops died, far exceeding American combat deaths in Afghanistan.

His mother Janine Lutz told the Sun-Sentinel: 'He was a casualty of war, stateside.

'This last week was the first time he seemed at peace, and I see now that
he had made up his mind. He didn't want to live any more.'

The Marine had been treated for PTSD at Camp
Lejeune in North Carolina when he returned to the U.S. in 2011. Family 
dog Kobe joined the 24-year-old at the base to be trained as a service 
dog while Lutz received counseling and medication.

However his mother said that her son had not been the same since entering combat, reacting badly to loud noise and battling mood swings.

Embattled: Lutz, 24, had served two tours, in Iraq and Afghanistan, which earned him 13 service recommendations

The 24-year-old had joined the Marine Corps straight from high school and did his first tour in 2007 in Iraq. He was later deployed to southern Helmand province in Afghanistan with the 2nd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment.

Lutz earned 13 service commendations while serving his country. A military memorial service will be held for him on Saturday at 4pm in Sunrise, Florida.

Pentagon figures released on Monday revealed that there were 349 suicides among active-duty troops in 2012, up from 301 the year before and exceeding the Pentagon's own internal projection of 325.

Statistics alone do not explain why troops take their own lives, and the Pentagon's military and civilian leaders have acknowledged that more needs to be done to understand the causes.

Last year's total is the highest since the Pentagon began closely tracking suicides in 2001. It exceeds the 295 Americans who died in Afghanistan last year.
