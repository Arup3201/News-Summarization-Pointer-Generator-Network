There were plenty of goals to keep everyone entertained in Tottenham's 5-3 win over Chelsea.

But goals wasn't the only focus at White Hart Lane as Sportsmail's Rob Draper takes you through the talking points from Spurs' sensational London derby victory over Jose Mourinho's outfit.

COSTA VS FAZIO RE-MATCH CANCELLED 

The Diego Costa-Federico Fazio rematch after their on-field fight in the Atletico-Sevilla clash last season failed to materialise.

But the Brazilian-born Spaniard manager to make himself a nuisance nonetheless with Jan Vertonghen looking ready to floor him after one late challenge on 43 minutes – though perhaps wisely, he backed down fairly swiftly.

MORE REF JUSTICE FOR MOURINHO OR DOUBLE STANDARDS FROM JOSE? 

Jose Mourinho was more animated than most of his players in his frequent berating of fourth official Andre Marriner in the second half, which reached a climax when Eden Hazard went down on 70 minutes.

But Fazio looked as if he played the ball and Hazard didn’t protest. Mourinho was quieter when Gary Cahill booted a grounded Harry Kane on 75 minutes right in front of both benches.

OSCAR GIVEN THE KANE AT THE BREAK 

It was the fourth match of the Christmas season so it was hardly surprising to see errors multiplying.

That said, the lacklustre way in which Oscar and Cesc Fabregas attempted to defend against Harry Kane as he made his run for the first-half equaliser was unforgivable. Tired or not, their efforts were lame and Oscar paid the price – substituted at half time.

BE A SPURS LEGEND, AND GO ABROAD 

Tottenham’s pre-match video show, lauding the legends of the club, grandly announces in hushed tones: ‘We are Blanchflower, Ardiles, Bale …’

Given that the latter only left 18 months ago, it seems an indecently-short time in which to elevate him to the Tottenham pantheon, given the vitriol the likes of Teddy Sheringham and Sol Campbell received for leaving the club. If you want to leave a club and still be welcome, go abroad.

FORMER SPURS STRIKER FALCO ADDS COLOUR(FUL LANGUAGE) AT THE LANE

Mark Falco raised some eyebrows with his on-pitch interview paying tribute to the late Ron Henry, the double-winning Tottenham left back who died aged 80 this week.

Fondly remembering being coached by Henry at the club Falco recalled how he was not averse to ‘giving you a bxxxxxing ’ – which was at least authentic if not entirely pre-watershed language.

THE BELGIANS ARE TAKING OVER THE PREMIER LEAGUE 

The Belgian takeover of the Premier League continues apace. When Mousa Dembele came on, he joined Jan Vertonghen, Nacer Chadli, Thibaut Courtois and Eden Hazard as the fifth player from that nation on the pitch.

Not that there was much love between the compatriots, given the rake down the back of the leg Vertonghen gave Hazard.
