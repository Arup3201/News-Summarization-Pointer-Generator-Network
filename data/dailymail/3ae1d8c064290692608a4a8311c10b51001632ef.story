DVDs, word cards and books will do little, if anything, to help teach a baby to read, according to a New York University study

DVDs, word cards and books will do little, if anything, to help teach a baby to read.

This is according to a New York study which claims that products designed to create infant geniuses could be a giant scam.

A seven month experiment with babies aged up to 18 months found reading and flashcards made no difference to the children, but had a massive effect on the parents.

The grown-ups were convinced their children were learning to read, although there was no scientific evidence to show this was true, said the study.

Researchers from New York University's School of Culture, Education and Human Development tested a range of available 'reading' products for babies.

This included DVDs, books with flip pages and specially designed word and picture cards, with the intention of getting the children to read earlier.

The research, reported in the Journal of Educational Psychology, took place over seven months with 117 babies aged nine to 18 months.

The children were randomly given different products or no products at all.

Those given the products were asked to use them daily and researchers paid the families regular visits to test the language development of the infants and to interview parents.

The youngsters were also brought into the lab to be given reading tests while tracking their eye movements.

These can show experts whether a child is actually reading and recognising words or simply looking at shapes on a page, for instance.

‘While we cannot say with full assurance that infants at this age cannot learn printed words, our results make clear they did not learn printed words from the baby media product that was tested,’ said professor Susan Neuman.

‘It's clear that parents have great confidence in the impact of these products on their children. However, our study indicates this sentiment is misplaced.’

A different study published earlier this month seems to contradict findings from New York University.

The study found it reading your baby a bedtime story could yield benefits for years to come.

Research shows that children who are spoken to a lot are faster at understanding words.

This speedy processing helps them do better at school – and could even help them get a good job, have a happy marriage and keep on the right side of the law.

Psychologist Anne Fernald said that the effects are so profound that talking to children should be treated as importantly as feeding them.

And it is never too early to start. Dr Fernald of Stanford University in California said: ‘If you want your kid to do well in school, talk to them as a baby.

‘If you bring a child into the world, we take on the responsibility for feeding them, keeping them clean and keeping them safe.

‘I think we now have enough scientific evidence to add something else to that list – and that is providing learning from infancy on.

‘Long before your baby is speaking, it is absorbing information about language.’
