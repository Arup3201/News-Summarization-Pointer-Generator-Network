Two Saudi men are facing jail after they were convicted of deliberately driving over a stray dog ten times until it was dead - and filming the despicable act of cruelty.

In the footage, which quickly went viral on social media, one of the men is seen driving a 4x4 vehicle in an unspecified desert area in Saudi Arabia while the second videos the clip.

The dog had been standing in the road when the car driver deliberately smashed  into it. Clearly still alive, but obviously crippled and unable to escape, it was then repeatedly run over.

Despicable: A frame from the video showing a young Saudi man repeatedly running over a dog in the desert

The video clip - which is too distressing to republish here on MailOnline - provoked a furious reaction. The pair were arrested after people who saw it urged authorities to take action.

It also sparked a campaign for the Saudi Wildlife Authority (SWA), responsible for the conservation and development of wildlife, to develop strong laws that would lead to harsher penalties for anyone who tortures animals.

The campaign to bring the men to justice was also backed by several key legal figures who said that it was not only inhumane but also against the teachings of Islam.

'This animal is a God's creation and its torture is a violation of the Islamic teachings,' said one of the participants in a social media group.

Another added: 'Islam recommends merciful treatment of animals.'

 'Violation of Islamic teachings': The video went viral on social media, where commenters slammed it as a deeply immoral act and urged authorities to take action against the pair

The court adjourned before sentencing and the pair face either jail or a fine of up to £90,000.

Jabir Al-Shehri of the Ministry of Agriculture said the two young men had clearly breached the terms of the the unified code of merciful treatment of animals adopted by all Gulf states.

Al-Shehri said the vehicle's number plate, which was clearly visible in the clip, was an important lead that helped security forces to arrest the culprits, who have not been named.
