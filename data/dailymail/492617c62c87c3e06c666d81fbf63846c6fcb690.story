A liberal magazine in Washington, D.C. has published secretly recorded audio of a strategy session, in which Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell McConnell's aides discussed how to use actress Ashley Judd's history of mental illness against her in a political opposition strategy.

The recording includes McConnell's voice, advising his staffers that 'this is the "Whac-A-Mole" period of the campaign,' referring to the popular carnival game involving a foam sledgehammer and a series of underground rodents.

'When anybody sticks their head up, do them out.'

Other meeting participants said Judd was 'emotionally unbalanced,' that she had 'suicidal tendencies,' and that she 'described having children as selfish.' Judd was also openly hostile to 'traditional Christianity,' the meeting heard.

McConnell campaign director Jesse Benton told MailOnline that the campaign has asked the FBI to investigate.

The February 2 conversation was part 
of a 'private senior strategist meeting, with a very small number of 
attendees,' Benton said. 'A "family meeting," if you will.' Asked for a 
specific number, Benton said 'about half a dozen' people were in the 
room.

'The recording clearly came form some
 sort of recording or listening device planted in our office without 
permission,' he said. 'We'll see what the FBI finds.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR AUDIO

Actress Ashley Judd read off vote totals from the state of Tennessee - not Kentucky - during the presidential roll call vote at the Democratic National Convention in 2012

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky tod his aides to play 'Whac-a-Mole' with Judd, a potential rival who ultimately decided not to run against him

The liberal muckraking magazine Mother Jones published the 11-minute audio recording on Tuesday, along with a transcript

The
 magazine made waves with another secret political recording in 2012 
when it published Mitt Romney's now-infamous claim that '47 percent' of 
Americans would vote for Barack Obama no matter what, because Obama 
would protect their government benefits in his second term.

The recording itself will provide anti-McConnell Democrats with fodder for months.

'I
 refer to [Judd] as sort of the oppo[sition] research situation where 
there's a haystack of needles,' the Mother Jones recording shows one 
McConnell aide saying, 'just because truly, there’s such a wealth of 
material.'

'She's clearly -
 this sounds extreme - but she is emotionally unbalanced. I mean it's 
been documented,' the meeting's leader said.

'Jesse
 can go in chapter and verse from her autobiography about, you know, 
she's suffered some suicidal tendencies. She was hospitalized for 42 
days when she had a mental breakdown in the '90s.

Judd lives in Tennessee and spent ever-increasing amounts of time in San Francisco, but planned to run for the US Senate from Kentucky, where she was raised. Her book, All That 
Is Bitter & Sweet, contained a wealth of opposition research for 
Republicans, including recollections of her fight with mental illness

In a recorded Associated Press interview played during the McConnell staff meeting, Judd is heard explaining how the sight of a pair of socks in an airport shop could prompt an odd reaction upon returning to the US after overseas travel.

'You know, I come back to this country. I freak out in airports,' the group heard Judd say. 'The colors, the sounds, ... The last time I came home from a trip, I absolutely flipped out when I saw pink fuzzy socks on a rack. I mean, I can never anticipate what is going to push me over the edge.'

'So pink fuzzy socks are of concern,' the amused meeting leader joked.

The group also heard that Judd 'is 
critical…of traditional Christianity. She sort of views it as sort of a 
vestige of patriarchy. She says Christianity gives a God like a man, 
presented and discussed exclusively with male imagery, which legitimizes
 and seals male power.'

McConnell's
 native Kentucky is a Bible-belt bastion of religious conservatism, a 
region where questions about God's gender would not play well in an 
election season.

Judd
 announced on Twitter that she wouldn't be running for Senate against 
Mitch McConnell, but the secret 'family meeting' at McConnell 
headquarters happened weeks beforehand

In another recording of Judd played during the meeting, she discussed her preference for 'native faith practices,' saying she has 'a very nature-based God concept.'

Mother Jones reporter David Corn argued that Judd has also publicly described herself as a garden-variety Christian.

But worse still for Judd - had she run for Senate - might have been campaign ammunition about her reported view that 'having children [is] selfish,' and that 'she thinks it's unconscionable to breed.'

The group also discussed the 
usefulness of portraying Judd as a carpetbagger who would run for a 
Senate seat in Kentucky while being on record claiming Tennessee and San
 Francisco as her native home.'

'Not only has she clearly claimed 
Tennessee as her home,' a voice on the recording says, 'she's actually 
mocked Kentucky to Tennessee audiences. She was bemoaning the low voter 
turnout among women in Tennessee. She said, "People, that's worse than 
even in Kentucky."'

That line of argument became part of the national conversation about Judd just four days later, with the release of a YouTube video by the political group American Crossroads. In included a clip of Judd telling an audience near her home in Nashville that one day, 'It just clicked: Tennessee is home.'

The Daily Caller highlighted one passage in her book, All That Is Bitter & Sweet, that could have become the subject of TV ads against her.

'When I began to dream of making myself a
 home I could live in for the rest of my life, a home that would shelter
 me longer than anywhere I had ever lived before, this was the place the
 fates seemed to choose for me,' she wrote in the memoir, referring to 
the 200-year-old Tennessee farmhouse that has been her legal residence since the 
1990s.

In a statement earlier Tuesday, the 
McConnell campaign had painted the audio's release to a liberal magazine
 as a political dirty trick.

'We've
 always said the Left would stop at nothing to attack Sen. McConnell, 
but Watergate-style tactics to bug campaign headquarters are above and 
beyond.,' the statement read.

'Senator
 McConnell's campaign is working with the FBI and has notified the local
 U.S. Attorney in Louisville, per FBI request, about these recordings. 
Obviously a recording device of some kind was placed in Senator 
McConnell's campaign office without consent. By whom and how that was 
accomplished presumably will be the subject of a criminal 
investigation.'

Problematic: Judd has called her Williamson County, Tennessee 
farmhouse home since the 1990s, which would have been an obstacle to her winning a US Senate election in neighboring Kentucky

McConnell campaign manager Jesse Benton (with former boss Ron Paul, L) said the audio's leak was the product of illegal wiretapping, and has asked the FBI to investigate

In Kentucky, it is legal to make secret recordings of conversations, provided that at least one of the conversation's participants is aware and gives consent. Other states have so-called 'all-party' consent laws, which provide that no one may be recorded without his or her permission. 

A federal law enforcement source told MailOnline that the FBI's involvement 'would typically commence after an illegally produced recording 'crossed state lines.'

Mother Jones magazine's parent organization, the nonprofit Foundation for National Progress, is based in San Francisco, California. Reporter David Corn, who broke the news Tuesday, is based in Washington, DC.

In a statement David Corn provided after this story was first published, Mother Jones magazine said it was 'recently provided the tape by a source who wished to remain anonymous. We were not involved in the making of the tape.'

'It is our understanding,' the statement also said, 'that the tape was not the product of a Watergate-style bugging operation. We cannot comment beyond that.'
