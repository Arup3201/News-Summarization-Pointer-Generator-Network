Simon Cowell found himself in the hot seat as he tried to avoid questions about his impending fatherhood at an ill-timed X Factor press panel on Thursday.

'Unfortunately, I have to keep this private for the moment. It's just one of those things, but thank you anyway,' said the 53-year-old at the Fox panel at the Television Critics Association 
meeting in Beverly Hills.

When a cheeky reporter asked, 'The new baby. Were you as surprised by the news as we were?'

The British born reality TV mogul replied, 'I haven't read the newspapers. Am I missing something?'

Still smug: Even being in the midst of a cheating scandal couldn't wipe the smile off Simon's face

Next question: Simon shrugged off speculation about his love child at the X Factor panel

Dressed
in his signature white T-shirt and a stoic expression, the media 
veteran handled the pressure well as he attempted to divert the 
attention to the upcoming season of the singing competition.

Cowell went on to tell the press at the Fox portion of the TCA summer tour that he will open up about married lover Lauren Silverman's pregnancy when the time is right.

'There are a lot of things I will eventually clear up when the time is right,' he explained. 'I really have to be sensitive here because there are a lot of people's feelings involved.'

When asked if he could reveal how he's feeling, Simon candidly replied, 'I would love to, but I have to respect a lot of other people's feelings.'

Unable to get an enlightening 
response from Simon, one determined reporter asked his X Factor 
colleagues Kelly Rowland, Paulina Rubio and Demi Lovato how they thought
he would be as a father.

'No comment,' said Demi, who is no stranger to public controversy herself, which quickly silenced the questioning.

Later speaking to magazine PEOPLE, Rowland, who was seen attempting to lighten the mood by playfully plucking out grey hairs from
Simon's head, said: 'I think that Simon has always been a very classy guy, he's always been a very respected guy, and he's going to be a great father.

Rubio, who just joined the show as a judge said: 'He didn't tell me anything yet, but I will support him if it is true.'

Lovato added: 'There's no reason for me to talk about his person life, and I'm here about talk about the show.

But she was very complimentary about show boss Cowell. She said: 'Simon is very tough but off camera he's like a teddy bear. He has a big heart,' she says.

'I've learned so much from him. I think he puts up a front with the rest of the world to be this bad guy but you get to know him he's a really, really sweet person.'

Promise: 'There are a lot of things I will eventually clear up when the time is right,' pledged the 53-year-old father-to-be

Strong support: Simon's fellow judges, Demi Lovato, Paulina Rubio and Kelly Rowland, tried to keep the topic to the reality show

Privacy please: Simon Cowell had to face uncomfortable questions about his baby scandal on Thursday at the Television Critics Association in Beverly Hills

Cowell, who is worth an estimated $305 million, insisted he will do everything he can to support and provide for his child after the news broke on Wednesday that 36-year-old Lauren is expecting.

It has now emerged that Mrs Silverman’s husband, Andrew, has cited Cowell in divorce papers. The move, clearly designed to embarrass him, could potentially force him to reveal details of the alleged affair in court.

Mrs Silverman is accused in the papers of adultery with Cowell and of being ‘cruel and inhuman’ towards her husband.

In a statement Mr Silverman said: 'My top priority is protecting my seven year old son while working to resolve all outstanding issues with my wife.  Hopefully people can respect the interest of our child during this process.'

Defensive: When reporters asked the judges their thoughts of Simon being a father, Demi replied: 'No comment'

Powerful woman: Rowland looked like a force to be reckoned with as she sat sternly on the TCA panel

While the breakdown of the Silverman marriage gets increasingly messy over in Bridgehampton, New York, it was business as usual back in Los Angeles when Simon finally got to answer questions about his job.

The former American Idol judge announced at Thursday’s panel that next season of The X Factor would offer a $1 million grand prize, down from $5 million, reported Variety.com.

'We got to a point where it was almost too much,' he said. 'We want artists to be artists. The prize is now $1 million, and they still get a Sony recording contract.'
