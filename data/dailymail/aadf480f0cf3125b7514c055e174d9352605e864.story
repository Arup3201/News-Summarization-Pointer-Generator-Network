Don’t you just love our country? I’m not being sarcastic. In April 2010, it was recorded in Hansard that ‘this House expresses profound sadness at the death of Corin Redgrave [and] recalls his life as a brilliant actor, peace campaigner, supporter of the downtrodden and man of enormous principle’.

Yet Redgrave, a stalwart of the Workers’ Revolutionary Party, had devoted much of his life to the overthrow of parliamentary democracy and our wicked capitalist ways.

Committed to the economic and political theories of Lenin and Trotsky, he saw money and materialism as the root cause of ‘inequality, social conflict and wars’. Mention Thatcher to him and he went blue in the face.

Corin fell in love with his second wife, Kika Markham, during a lecture at the Derbyshire College of Marxist Education. They spent their honeymoon thinking up ways of ‘fighting Thatcher, unemployment and racism’.

As an actor, Corin developed into a magnificent and authoritative presence. His one-man show about Oscar Wilde was acclaimed in London and New York.

I myself witnessed him play Sir Anthony Blunt, the Soviet double-agent, in a one-man show presented in Bromyard, Herefordshire, the town in which Corin and his sister, Vanessa, had spent the war as evacuees. Such was his magnetism that, at the end, he had us all lustily singing The Red Flag.

As a performer, Corin had shaped up into someone as impressive as his late father, Sir Michael Redgrave.

I was slightly disconcerted to discover in Our Time Of Day, however, that, when Sir Michael died and was cremated in 1985, Corin ever afterwards kept the ashes in his car, ‘unable to part with them’. Strange behaviour.

As a chain-smoker and alcoholic, Corin was asking for trouble and, in 2005, recovering from prostate cancer on holiday in Italy, ‘he was shivering and shaking like a leaf’, says Kika.

The emergency doctor ‘couldn’t tell if it was very bad flu or whether it might have been a heart attack’.

Back in Britain, Corin was addressing a meeting of the Dale Farm gypsies in Basildon when he collapsed. He was taken, unconscious, to intensive care and put on a life-support machine. He had suffered ‘severe brain damage from the lack of oxygen after the cardiac arrest’.

Would it have been a kindness had he died? The ensuing five years, which are recorded here in a completely engrossing and harrowing mix of diaries, memos, scraps, letters and heartbreaking reminiscence, were hell on Earth for Kika — because, when Corin regained consciousness, he had clean forgotten who she was.

He was lucid, ‘articulate and passionate’, but his memory had been obliterated. Our Time Of Day is a horror story about a husband who wakes up and has no idea he’d ever been in love with his wife. Emotion and tenderness — all gone.

‘I can’t remember our life together,’ Corin confesses and, as Kika says, ‘both our lives had disappeared. For what use are memories if they only exist for one person’. She was placed in the unique position of grieving for a man who was not technically dead. To all intents and purposes, Corin was insane.

Moved to the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, in Bloomsbury, he thought he was ‘in some kind of hotel in Singapore’. He failed to recognise London, believing the trees and parks were a garden in Vienna.

He didn’t want to co-operate with the doctors because ‘he didn’t think there was anything the matter . . . He thought people were lying to him and that his life was in danger.’

He was convinced he was the target of a ‘State conspiracy’ and the Secret Police were coming for him. ‘We must get away!’ he screamed. He tried to do just that, in a taxi. ‘Corin is angry and won’t be pacified,’ remembers Kika. Eventually, Vanessa offered to look after her brother at her flat.

But there was little improvement. Such was Corin’s rage and fear, he reckoned people were hidden in the wardrobe, listening to him — so he insisted on silence. Piteously, he could never remember that his mother had died and faced ‘the terrible freshness of sorrow’ each time he was told the truth.

He started to confuse Kika with his first wife, Deirdre, and what it boiled down to was that Corin no longer had any capacity to reflect. He could only cope and survive ‘in the moment’.

Kika talking about her memoirs. She says that by the time Corin's brain damage had set in they had both lost their lives

The miracle, however — the anomaly — is that, despite being sectioned in a mental hospital, despite his increasing ‘disinhibition’ (urinating in public view, buttonholing complete strangers), despite his loss of co-ordination and balance, Corin’s ‘creative power has not diminished one bit’, and he could still work: Beckett on the radio, film and television cameos.

But then, he could go quite unpredictably crazy again. Hearing a playback of himself in King Lear, he asked, without trying to be funny: ‘Who’s written this? It’s not Shakespeare. Who’s written it?’

Within the midst of this maelstrom, Kika’s steadfastness is an inspiration, like a heroine in a Greek tragedy.

Though ‘we were unable to communicate with one another through familiar ways’, and even though Corin had no remorse about his condition (because he didn’t believe he was poorly — asked if he was upset at having no recollection of his life with Kika he said, rather callously, ‘No, not really. It’s strange’), she never for a single second gives up on what they’d had, what they’d been, before the darkness fell.

Darkness fell for good in 2010, when Corin suffered a burst aneurysm. His ashes are interred in Highgate Cemetery — not kept in the car.

‘I was alone,’ says Kika, ‘without a plan.’ The actuality is that she’d already been alone for years.
