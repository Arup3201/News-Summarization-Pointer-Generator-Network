Eddie Hearn will hold a crisis meeting with Team Sauerland just hours before Paul Smith takes on Arthur Abraham after the two teams failed to agree which gloves will be worn for the world title fight. 

The disagreement occurred during the routine rules meeting which took place after the weigh-in on Friday afternoon in Germany.

WBO super-middleweight champion Abraham selected the 10oz Everlast 1910 model for Smith to wear, even though the Liverpudlian prefers to wear Grant gloves since breaking his hand in his fight with George Groves in 2011.

Paul Smith's promoter Eddie Hearn has revealed there has been a dispute over which gloves shown be worn for his fighter's world title bought after reigning WBO super-middleweight champion Arthur Abraham

It is understood that the selected gloves seemed much bigger than the favoured Grants, which would not have helped Smith in this fight because of his punch power.

It is common place for a champion to select which gloves will be worn but Smith and his team were not happy with the model and style selected at the meeting.

Now promoter Eddie Hearn has arranged for three different models of Everlast gloves to be couriered out from England overnight – and Abraham must choose one of them.

The two teams will now be forced to meet once again at midday on Saturday – just 10 hours before the boxers are due in the ring – to resolve the problem and finally select which gloves will be worn.

Sportsmail columnist Hearn said: 'Abraham requested that we wear Everlast 1910 gloves. These were not of a style we have seen of that particular model before.

'Paul was not happy with the design or the quality of the glove selection. We are happy for Arthur to select gloves for Paul but had requested that Paul wear Grant gloves, as he has done for the majority of his recent fights.

'When you're given an opportunity, like we have been by Abraham and his team as a voluntary defence, you have to accept certain things. One of them was that he selected the gloves and we have no problem with that.

'Abraham insists that Paul wears Everlast so we have couriered out three other models for Abraham to inspect in the morning. Fighters clearly need to protect their hands and also be comfortable, particularly in a fight of this magnitude.

'We'l meet in the morning, not trying to be difficult, we're just protecting our fighter. He needs to be comfortable with the gloves for a fight of this magnitude.'

The situation is reminiscent of Floyd Mayweather's first fight with Marcos Maidana back in May, when champion Mayweather took exception to the gloves his opponent was planning to wear.

The Argentinean wanted to wear the Everlast MX, known as a glove favoured by big punchers, which had been customised to the blue and colours of his nation's flag.

But Mayweather and his CEO Leonard Ellerbe said there was not enough padding on the glove and eventually Maidana was forced to wear the softer Everlast Powerlock glove.
