Stealth bombers with nuclear-capability took to the skies over South Korea today, as relations between the country and its neighbour to the North continue to deteriorate.

These images - which show a pair of U.S. Air Force B-2 bombers soaring over an American military base south of Seoul - were taken after it emerged North Korea had digitally doctored a state photo of military hovercraft to make the fleet appear bigger than it was.

The drill over the base in Pyeongtaek today is likely to aggravate already simmering tensions on the Korean peninsula.

Nuclear-capable: The U.S. has said previous drills were prompted by escalating North Korean rhetoric

The drill was carried out after North 
Korea declared it was severing its key hotline to Seoul yesterday, amid 
anger over joint U.S. and South Korean military drills and tough 
sanctions imposed in the wake of Pyongyang's recent nuclear test.

The South Korean news agency Yonhap said the drills were described by the U.S. as 'deterrence missions'.

It quoted a military source as saying the drill involved the bomber - capable of deploying both nuclear and conventional weapons - striking a mock target.

This week Pyongyang, which is dealing with tightened economic sanctions following its internationally condemned decision to launch a third nuclear test last month, repeated threats to target U.S. military bases in response.

The rhetoric from North Korea - which has threatened the United States with nuclear war and rehearsed drone attacks on South Korea - and Washington's hardening reaction, has drawn more concern from China, Pyongyang's only major ally.

China has described the situation as 'sensitive'.

Pyongyang says United Nations sanctions,
agreed after North Korea carried out a third nuclear test in February, 
are part of a Washington-led plot to topple its leadership.

'From this moment, the Supreme 
Command of the Korean People's Army will be putting into combat duty 
posture No. 1 all field artillery units, including long-range artillery 
units and strategic rocket units, that will target all enemy objects in 
U.S. invasionary bases on its mainland, Hawaii and Guam, the North's 
KCNA news agency said on Tuesday.

The order was issued in a statement from the North Korea's military 'supreme command'.

The Pentagon condemned North Korea's rhetoric, saying it was designed to 'raise tensions and intimidate others'."

'They need to stop threatening peace 
on the peninsula. That doesn't help anyone ... and we stand ready to 
respond to any contingency,' Pentagon spokesman George Little told 
reporters.

South Korea's defence ministry has 
said it saw no sign of imminent military action by North Korea and most 
military analysts say Pyongyang will not risk a conflict with the United
States that it would lose.

South Korea and the U.S. military are
conducting military drills until the end of April, which they have 
stressed are strictly defensive in nature.

The North accused Washington of war 
preparations in the wake of drills carried out earlier this month which 
saw bombers soaring over the peninsula.

The latest show of strength in the 
South comes after a photograph of North Korean army hovercraft issued by
the country's state media was found to have been digitally doctored.

Close examination of the suspicious 
photograph suggested officials had resorted to Photoshop to turn five 
military hovercraft into eight.
