Amir Khan well and truly earned his place among the three best welterweights in the world after his convincing win over Devon Alexander, says Sportsmail's Jeff Powell in Las Vegas.

The Bolton welterweight now 'deserves' to get his long-awaited fight against Floyd Mayweather Jr, but if the champion watched Khan in action - as he said he would - he may be having second thoughts. The American's potential clash with Manny Pacquiao makes that meeting complicated.

Regardless, Khan 'completely outclassed, dominated and dazzled' on the Strip and delivered on his promise to make a statement in this fight. 'Khan is heading for greatness,' says Powell
