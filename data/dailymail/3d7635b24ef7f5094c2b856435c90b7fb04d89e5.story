Justin Bieber has apologised a second time for video footage showing him making racist remarks.

He was forced to make his latest apology after a second video emerged showing Bieber singing his hit song One Less Lonely Girl, but changing the final words to ‘lonely n*****’.

The singer, who fans branded ‘an arrogant little twerp’ over the footage, also uses sick lyrics about killing black people and joining the Ku Klux Klan.

Footage: A 14-Year-Old Justin sings 'One Less Lonely N*****', an adaption of his hit 'One Less Lonely Girl' where he talks about murdering a black man and joining the racist KKK

The 24-second clip follows the release of a video a few days ago in which he asked: ‘Why are black people afraid of chainsaws?’ before imitating the noise of a chainsaw and saying: ‘Run n*****, n*****, n*****, n*****, n*****’.

The footage will further jeopardise his career, which has already suffered from a string of run-ins with police in America and his native Canada.

Now he has apologised - once again - for the latest controversial footage.

He told The Sun: 'Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I've ever dealt with.

'But I feel now that I need to take responsibility for those mistakes and not let them linger.

'At the end of the day, I just need to step up and own what I did.'

He said in a statement: ‘I’m very sorry. I take my friendships with people of all  cultures very seriously and apologise for offending or hurting anyone with my  childish and inexcusable mistake.

‘I was a kid then and I am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again.’

Racists: The popstar was reportedly caught on camera changing the lyrics of his song One Less Lonely Girl to sing 'one less lonely n*****' - and joked about joining white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan (file picture)

Bieber, 20, who has sold more than 15million albums and earned a reported £80million, blamed the first video, filmed when he was 15, on youthful indiscretion.

In the latest footage Bieber wears a blue shirt and a dog tag necklace. A female friend can be 
heard laughing in the background, and the singer smiles as he gives his 
twisted rendition of Lonely Girl, the original version of which has been
 viewed 203million times on YouTube.

The Ku Klux Klan was a racist organisation set up in Tennessee in 1866 to resist plans to create racial equality.

Believing in white supremacy, the US group's members terrorised leaders, both black and white, who called for greater integration.

Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest was the first leader, or 'grand wizard', and presided over a hierarchy of 'grand dragons', 'grand titans' and 'grand cyclopses'.

Members of the group - which is also known for being anti-Catholic - wore white costumes with masks and conical hats designed to scare opponents and hide their identities.

After dying out in the 1870s, the group was reformed around 1915 and took up the sign of the burning cross at rallies.

Partly fuelled by fears over immigration from the First World War and Russian revolution in Europe, the group swelled to its largest ever size of around 4million members in the 1920s.

Despite a slight resurgence during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, the group has slowly died away and is now thought to have fewer than 5,000 members.

Last night show business
 website TMZ reported that the new video was captured when Bieber was 
14, after he had seen a comedian’s parody of Lonely Girl.

The website also claimed
 Bieber had  realised at the time that making the recording was a 
mistake, and had told his mentor, the R’n’B star Usher Raymond, and 
actor Will Smith. Mr Raymond rebuked him and showed him videos to 
illustrate the evils of racial prejudice, it reported.

What's more, TMZ reports that the Young Money Entertainment clan, which features the likes of 'Lil Wayne and Birdman – who Justin regularly hangs out with – are supporting the Never Say Never hitmaker.

Mack Maine, President of Young Money, is quoted by the website as saying: 'Bieber does not have a slave mentality.  He treats his people with respect.'

Fans in Britain and the US – who call themselves ‘Beliebers’ – left him in no doubt about their dismay last night.

One, LizaCar, said: ‘He needs to go back to school, get an education, receive [some] discipline and learn some respect.

‘He’s out of control and it’s not going to have a happy ending the rate it’s going.’

Jamal Jackson, from 
Liverpool, wrote: ‘No I don’t care, you know there are certain words you
 shouldn’t use and that’s hurtful words against other people. Sorry 
Justin you can’t type a little message on twitter and get out of it!’

Another online commenter branded the baby-faced singer an ‘arrogant little twerp’.

A user calling 
themselves Disgruntled Reader, from California, said: ‘The KKK isn’t 
funny, racism isn’t funny and using the n-word isn’t funny.

People were terrorized, 
abused and murdered over the  colour of their skin at one time, and 
making a joke of it is nothing short of breathtaking stupidity and 
arrogance.’

Twitter users in the US 
mocked the singer by posting a picture of KKK members apparently saying:
 ‘We would like to  distance ourselves from Mr Bieber. All organisations
 have a few embarrassing members.’

The white supremacist Ku Klux Klan lynched hundreds of black people in the southern US.

Showing him the way: Usher took Justin aside and showed him some racist videos to help him understand why his behaviour was so terrible

Turning to God: As well as his apology, Bieber posted this Bible passage on Wednesday, from the book of John and from Isaiah, both passages relate to forgiveness

'I'm sorry': Bieber apologised for the earlier video clip this week, saying that when he was a child he did not realise how certain words could hurt, adding that he learned from his mistakes

Bieber shot to fame as a 15 year old in 2009 when his YouTube songs – recorded in his bedroom – became a global phenomenon.

Since then he has sold more than 15million albums and earned a reported £80million.

But
 the singer has shed his clean-cut, Christian image in favour of tattoos
 and gangster clothing and has been embroiled in a series of 
controversies thanks to his increasingly hedonistic lifestyle.

In
 January, the singer’s home in Los Angeles was searched by police after 
he allegedly threw eggs at a neighbour’s house. Officers found two jars 
of cannabis and cocaine and arrested one of his friends.

The
 following week, Bieber himself was arrested for allegedly drag-racing 
his Lamborghini on a public street in Miami and being over the 
drink-drive limit.

Last year
 he upset thousands of fans in London by arriving late for a concert, 
spitting on fans from a balcony and lashing out at a photographer in a 
street.

He was also 
pictured allegedly smoking cannabis at a party, while drugs and a Taser 
handgun were found on his tour bus in Sweden.

The videos are likely to
 disappoint the black artists who have worked with Bieber, including  
Will.i.am and Nicki Minaj. Usher Raymond has yet to offer any
 comments in support of his protegé.

However, on Thursday Lil Wayne and other members of Young Money Entertainment were quick to say they still supported Bieber and had dismissed his 'mistake'.

After a string of 
outrageous antics, Bieber’s clean-cut Christian image has been replaced 
by that of a tattooed bad boy who once spat on fans from a balcony.

He has been charged with
 assault in Toronto for allegedly punching a limousine driver in the 
back of the head while he was driving him and his entourage.

He has pleaded not 
guilty to  driving under the influence and driving with an expired 
licence after being caught allegedly drag racing in a yellow Lamborghini
 in Miami Beach, Florida.

The Los Angeles County 
Sheriff’s Department is still investigating him after eggs were thrown 
at his neighbour’s home in Calabasas, California.

When police raided  
Bieber’s mansion they found cocaine left ‘in plain view’ and arrested 
his rapper friend Lil Za for drug possession.

His actions have 
provoked such a backlash in the US that a White House petition calling 
for the Canadian to be kicked out of the US reached more than 180,000 
signatures.

TMZ last night claimed 
Bieber had been approached two months ago by a man who wanted £650,000 
for the first video, of the racist joke, but his PR team refused.

The man then supposedly 
asked for half that sum but Bieber’s  people refused again, saying they 
did not think it would do much damage since he was so young.
