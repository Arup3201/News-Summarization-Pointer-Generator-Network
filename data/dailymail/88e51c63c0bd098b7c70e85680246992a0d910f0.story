For many workers, Christmas Day represents yet another daily grind in the office. 

With that in mind, these BBC employees took it upon themselves to jazz up their day with a merry jig round the Christmas tree in the middle of their multi-million pound newsroom.

But staff were left red-faced when the camera panning through the revamped newsroom prior to the headlines showed them linking arms and bouncing round the tree in Christmas hats.

It also appears to show a member of staff dressed in a bear costume awkwardly watching the scene in the corner of the shot.  

The dance left presenter Julian Worricker looking rather bashful as he began his festive news bulletin.

When the BBC first moved in to their 'fish bowl' 24-hour news studio, it attracted complaints from viewers who spotted staff scoffing chips, chomping bananas, chatting and even picking their noses in the background of news broadcasts. 

The Beeb moved to its new Broadcasting House, located in Portland Place and Langham Place, from its previous home in Television Centre in March 2013. 

The ultra-modern extension to the famous 1932 art-deco building was designed by architect Sir Richard MacCormac.

At the time a BBC spokesman said: 'Our newsroom is designed to showcase the best of the BBC’s journalism and to enable teams from all platforms to work together more collaboratively and efficiently. 

'Staff are aware that they should behave appropriately.'
