Southampton's early exit from the FA Cup means that Ronald Koeman's side have a weekend off, and the south-coast outfit headed to snowy Switzerland for a mid-season break.

On Thursday, Koeman posted a picture of himself kitted out in full ice hockey kit, but now a video has emerged of the team in action... and they certainly shouldn't quit their day jobs any time soon.

The Saints returned to winning ways on Tuesday night against Crystal Palace, but their recent form has seen them slip out of top four in the Premier League.

And talking of slips, most of the squad struggled to stay on their feet as they took to the ice on Thursday to participate in a sport they're less familiar with.

One particular struggler was striker Graziano Pelle, who showed less pace than he does on a Saturday afternoon, and needed to be helped around the ice by Southampton chairman Ralph Krueger - who is a former ice hockey player and coach.

Ryan Bertrand smiled for the cameras, and celebrated after slotting the puck through the legs of a helpless goalkeeper during a match between two teams.

Ice hockey is, of course, a sport synonymous with injuries, but a disclaimer at the end of the YouTube video, uploaded by the club, confirmed that the afternoon passed without incident.

'No footballers were hurt during the making of this video,' read the message, and it is one that will relieve Saints fans watching.

Koeman's side are back in action next Sunday, when they face perhaps their toughest test of the season - a trip to Stamford Bridge to play Chelsea.
