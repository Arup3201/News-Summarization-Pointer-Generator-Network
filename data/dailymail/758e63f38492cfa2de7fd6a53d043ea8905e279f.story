Myer boss Bernie Brookes is stepping down after almost nine years in charge, as Australia’s largest department store chain pushes to modernise its business. 

The Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, who joined the retail company in June 2006, resigned as Myer promised to ‘adapt more quickly and be closer to its customers’ after a drop in share prices last year.

In an executive shake-up that will see Myer’s Chief Information and Supply Chain Officer Richard Umbers take over Brookes’ role, the chain said in a statement: ‘It is appropriate for a new CEO to be given the opportunity to own, lead and drive the transformation program over the coming years.’

‘It has become clear that to thrive in a modern retail environment, Myer must adapt more quickly and be closer to its customers,’ Myer Chairman, Mr Paul McClintock AO, said.

‘A strategic review has been ongoing for some time, with a view to reshaping the business for a profitable, sustainable future.

‘Already in his time at Myer, Richard has demonstrated that he is a contemporary retailer with the clear ability to reshape Myer in a new retail landscape,’ Mr McClintock said.

The retail giant will pay Umbers $1.2 million annually and he will also be eligible for performance-based bonuses.

Umbers, who trained as an engineer in the British army, joined Myer in September 2014 after previously holding executive positions at Australia Post and Woolworths.

In September last year, Myer shares fell 19 per cent, reducing more than $262 million from its market capitalisation.

The share dive came after Myer’s release of its full-year results and its profit guidance for 2015.

UBS analyst Ben Gilbert told the Sydney Morning Herald at the time that he predicted a ‘sell’ on Myer. 

‘Despite putting on a brave face, [the] fiscal 2014 result showed that Myer is struggling and having to spend more to stand still,’ he said.

‘We believe Myer management are doing a good job but face numerous challenges that pose a significant threat to future earnings.’ 

Mr Gilbert listed the threats to Myer's business as new competition in the market such as Uniqlo, Sephora and H&M, the falling Australian dollar and rising costs. 

Announcing his resignation, Mr Brookes said: ‘Myer is a fantastic company with an iconic brand and legacy that I remain incredibly passionate about. While there is no doubt that there are many challenges facing the business, I do believe Myer has a strong future ahead of it. 

‘After almost nine years, the time is now right for me to pass on the reins to the next leader to take the business forward. 

Myer is Australia's largest department store and is pushing to modernise its business  

‘Having now worked with Richard for six months I know that he has the right experience and a great desire to see Myer succeed. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Myer and wish the team all the best with the next exciting phase for this great business.’ 

Myer also announced the resignation of Chief Financial Officer Mark Ashby. ‘Mark has been offered a great opportunity in the United States and he leaves with our best wishes,’ Mr McClintock said. 

The department store’s interim results for the 26 weeks ended 24 January 2015 will be released on 19 March 2015.
