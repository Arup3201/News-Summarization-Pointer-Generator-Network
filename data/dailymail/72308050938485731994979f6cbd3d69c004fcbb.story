She took a nasty tumble just five weeks ago when she was filming The Jump TV ski show for Channel 4, breaking two ribs and having to be flown home from filming early.

Now Sally Bercow’s skiing days may be over – at least for a while – after a horrific downhill accident this week that left her with a leg shattered in nine different pieces and saw her winched off the slope by helicopter.

The 45-year-old colourful wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow was on a skiing holiday with her three children when she tumbled on a red route at the Austrian alpine resort of Lienz on Tuesday - just a couple of days into her holiday.

Hospital: A horrific downhill skiing accident has left Sally Bercow with a leg shattered in nine different pieces

Taken away: The Speaker's wife was winched off the slope at the Austrian alpine resort of Lienz by helicopter

Airlifted: The 45-year-old was just a couple of days into her skiing holiday when the accident happened

Up she goes: It was more than ten minutes before a medical evacuation helicopter arrived to winch her away

‘I don’t really know what happened but I had just switched to racing skis and they are a bit faster than I am used to,' said Mrs Bercow.

‘I knew immediately it was bad. It felt like my leg was hanging off.’

Companions called for help by mobile phone but it was more than ten minutes before a medical evacuation helicopter arrived to winch her off the mountainside.

‘They were very quick but it seemed like an age to me,’ said Mrs Bercow. ‘I was in total agony. As soon as the paramedics arrived I told them to hit me with some morphine.

Revealing the damage: Doctors X-rayed her leg and found both bones below the left knee had been broken

Injuries: Mrs Bercow's shin bone had shattered into eight pieces and her fibula had sheared right through

Recovery: Mrs Bercow had been on a skiing holiday with her three children when she tumbled on a red route

'I don’t really remember much about it after that.’

Once at the local hospital doctors X-rayed her leg and discovered both bones below the left knee had been broken. 

Her shin bone had shattered into eight pieces and her fibula had sheared right through.

Mrs Bercow said: ‘They told me they were going to operate and insert screws and a metal plate – if they could find one big enough.

'I will probably have it in me for the rest of my life, which will make things fun at airport security.

‘The surgeon told me that if he has done his job properly I should not have a limp and if there’s anywhere you want to break a leg I guess it’s at a ski resort – they are the experts.’

Her husband John, who had not accompanied his family on the half-term ski-break because he was preparing for the General Election campaign, was alerted immediately and has been monitoring his wife’s condition by phone. 

Mrs Bercow has been told she will be free to leave hospital on Sunday and fly back to Britain but it will be 12 weeks before she is back on her feet properly.

In the meantime she is grateful the Speaker’s House is one of the parts of the Palace of Westminster that has disabled access with a lift and a ramp.

And there’s one last bright spot. ‘At least I should be able to get out of General Election canvassing for a while,’ joked Mrs Bercow.
