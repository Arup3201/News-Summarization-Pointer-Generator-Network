Britain’s phone users are being charged more for calls and text messages at home than they are in Europe, a report claimed today.

Following the EU’s introduction of lower caps on the cost of roaming in the region, consumer experts say that domestic customers are unprotected by price rises imposed by networks within the UK.

Sending a text to another UK number can cost up to three times more from within Britain as it does when roaming in Europe, according to analysis by MoneySavingExpert.com.

For example, Vodafone pay-as-you-go customers pay 14p for each text to UK numbers when at home - compared to just 5p when roaming.

The 
latest mobile roaming regulations from the EU, which were imposed last 
month, have been put in place to protect people from being ripped-off 
when using their phone within Europe.

But at the same time, the costs of calls and text messages from UK to UK numbers has increased, the report said.

Making
 calls to European numbers is also much more expensive from within the 
UK - with the cost coming in at up to eight times as much as when 
roaming in Europe.

The 
research found that a ten-minute call from the UK to an Italian number 
will cost no more than £15 - but the same call made from the same UK 
mobile number from Sweden will be £1.80.

Daniel Hannan, Conservative MEP for South
 East England, told MailOnline: ‘There was no need for price-fixing in 
what was already a competitive market.

Falling prices: A new EU cap on roaming costs came in on July 1, which put a limit of 19¢ plus VAT a minute on the cost of outgoing calls. This equates to a total of 18.24p a minute, including VAT, for British consumers

Active mobile subscribers: Figures from telecoms regulator Ofcom state that the average UK pay-as-you-go user sends 135 texts and makes 51 minutes of calls in a month

‘As a result of this cap, non-travellers 
are subsidising travellers. Teenagers on council estates are subsidising people like MEPs and Eurocrats. Brussels is taking 
from the poor to give to the rich.’

Bizarrely, it can in fact be cheaper to use a foreign European SIM card when in the UK rather than a British one.

The average pay-as-you-go user spends £26.91 on calls and texts but using a SIM from another European country will reduce this to £17.79 - saving more than £100 in a year.

This calculation is based on figures from telecoms regulator Ofcom that the average UK pay-as-you-go user sends 135 texts and makes 51 minutes of calls in a month.

However, you would pay to receive calls if using a foreign SIM. But if you received a similar number of minutes of calls each month – this would only add £2.55 to the cost, making the total £20.34.

Texting UK numbers: On every mobile network examined in the report, bar Three's pay-as-you-go service, it is cheaper to send a text to a number in the UK while holidaying in Europe than it is when in the UK

Differences: The research found all the mobile operators charge their customers more to text a foreign European number from within the UK than when abroad

Steve Nowottny, consumer expert at MoneySavingExpert.com, said: ‘It simply defies logic and common sense that calling and texting a UK mobile often costs more from within the UK than it does when travelling in Europe. 

'Despite being introduced to help keep costs down, the EU cost cap has led to a financial paradox and mobile prices which are bizarrely skewed'

‘Despite being introduced to help keep costs down, the EU cost cap has led to a financial paradox and mobile prices which are bizarrely skewed.  

‘People are getting savvy about protecting themselves from big bills when they go on holiday, but now they need to wise-up to the tips and tricks that can keep their costs down when making calls and sending text messages on home soil.

‘Ultimately though, mobile phone networks need to take a long hard look at their pricing structures and explain why they're able to charge their customers less when they're using their phone abroad than they do when they're at home.’

Receiving a text in Europe has been free since 2009, but last month the Mail reported how one in six travellers suffers a mobile phone bill shock after using their handsets abroad.

Calling UK numbers: Excluding Three and GiffGaff, on all networks pay-as-you-go users have to spend more to call UK numbers from home than when in Europe

Location, location, location: On every UK mobile network, it is cheaper to call an EU number - either mobile or landline - while roaming in Europe than it is when in Britain

Consumer champion Which? warned that mobile networks were cashing in on the fact many travellers are in the dark about the cost of using handsets on holiday.

A new cap on roaming costs came in on July 1, which put a limit of 19¢ plus VAT a minute on the cost of outgoing calls. This equates to a total of 18.24p a minute, including VAT, for British consumers.

The cost of sending a text is capped at 6¢ plus VAT, which equates to 5.76p for UK families. The figure is 20¢ plus VAT – or a total of 19.2p – for one MB download of data.

MailOnline reported in April how lawmakers in Brussels had voted to back a proposal to scrap EU roaming charges, which will be phased out by December 2015.

The landmark ruling means that British people travelling to one of the 28-member states will have the same charges for calls, texts and mobile data use as they would using their mobile phones at home.
