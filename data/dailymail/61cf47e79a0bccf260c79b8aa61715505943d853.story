President Barack Obama has selected acting Secret Service Director Joe Clancy to stay on as head of the agency permanently.

The White House repeatedly cited on Wednesday the 'credibility' of 27-year-veteran of the Secret Service as the reason he selected.

Clancy was brought on by Obama last year after former Director Julia Pierson resigned amid fury over security breaches at the White House and elsewhere that put the president in danger.

President Barack Obama has decided to appoint Joseph Clancy to be the new head of the Secret Service. Clancy, the acting director of the agency, must now be confirmed by the Senate before he can permanently take over

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest noted Wednesday Clancy still has 'a lot of work' to do to restore the agency's reputation, but his 'solid performance' in the position so far cemented the president's belief that he was the man for the job.

A Department of Homeland Security report following the string of embarrassing scandals involving the Secret Service last fall - including a situation last fall in which the president was allowed to ride in an elevator at a government building with an unvetted security agent carrying a gun - concluded that the agency would benefit from having an outsider at the helm.

The Secret Service it said was too 'insular' and the agency was 'starving for leadership.'  

Clancy was in retirement when Obama begged him to come back on in an interim position to lead the ailing agency. He previously served in the president's detail.

Earnest told reporters Wednesday that Clancy had proven that he was able to take a 'candid, clear-eyed' position on reform of the agency.

Already, he asked to resign or transfer within DHS at least six longtime agents, including the No. 2 at the Secret Service, Alvin Smith, and four assistant directors. 

He has also ordered all officers who work at the White House to undergo additional training, Earnest revealed, following a 2014 incident in which a man armed with a knife made it over the fence and into the White House before he was stopped by an agent.

Earnest said that Clancy's willingness 'to use his credibility' to make changes and his experience at the agency is 'in some ways is the best of both worlds' when it comes to turning around operations within the security agency.

Clancy 'holds himself to a very high standard of professionalism,' Earnest said, and the White House believes 'his style of leadership will have a positive effect on the agency.'

Clancy must be confirmed by the Senate before he can officially be named Secret Service Director.

House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz said Wednesday it is 'disappointing the President ignored the recommendation' from the independent panel that reviewed Secret Service operations at the request of Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson.

'The Panel made it crystal clear that only a director from outside the agency would meet the needs of the agency today – someone with a fresh perspective, free from allegiances and without ties to what has consistently been described as a "good old boys network," ' Chaffetz said in a statement.

He added, 'The good men and women of the Secret Service are screaming for a fresh start.'

Chaffetz said the Secret Service 'would best be served by a transformative and dynamic leader from outside the agency.'

Still, the Utah Republican said he appreciates the work Clancy has done in his short time at the agency to implement the recommendations of the blue ribbon panel and looks forward to working with him.
