CEO Mark Benjamin was one of the passengers on the private plane that crashed in Santa Monica, CA

Four bodies have been pulled from a private jet that exploded into flames after sliding off a runway in Santa Monica, California, Sunday evening.

Morley Builders CEO Mark Benjamin and his son, Luke, a senior project engineer, were passengers, according to a statement by Vice President Charles Muttillo on the company's website.

Since Mark Benjamin often piloted the jet, it is not clear who the other two people aboard the aircraft were, or if he was at the controls at the time of the accident.

Smoke could been seen billowing high into the sky above the Santa Monica Airport, where the twin-engine Cessna Citation jet crashed into a hanger about Sunday afternoon.

However, Santa Monica Fire Captain John Nevandro told reporters 'It was an unsurvivable crash.'

'When we got there, the whole hangar that the plane went into was completely involved and full of flames,' Nevandro said.

KNBC-TV
reports that the plane crashed about 6.20pm Pacific Time. At no point 
during the flight did the pilot report any problems with the plane. 
Officials are hoping to recover the cockpit voice recorder from the 
plane, as well as the flight plan from the FAA.

Witnesses reported seeing the plane veer to the right after landing, with the turn becoming much sharper as the plane went further, eventually colliding with a row of four hangars and bursting into flames.

As the plane collided, the hangar walls wrapped around the plane's fuselage and steel trusses collapsed on top of the aircraft, making it impossible to gain access to the cabin, National Transportation Safety Board investigator Van Kenny said during a news conference today.

The plane was landing in Santa Monica en route from Hailey, Idaho, a resort town the boasts celebrity residents like Tom Hanks, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis.
