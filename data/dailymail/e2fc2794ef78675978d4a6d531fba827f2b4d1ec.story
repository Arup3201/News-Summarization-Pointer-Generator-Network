Allegations: Princess Cristina, the daughter of Spain's King Juan Carlos, has been ordered to appear in court to answer questions over alleged tax fraud and money laundering

Princess Cristina, the daughter of Spain's King Juan Carlos, has been ordered to appear in court to answer questions over alleged tax fraud and money laundering in the latest blow to the royal 
family's reputation.

Palma de Mallorca court judge Jose Castro subpoenaed the 48-year-old princess to appear on March 8 for questioning 
about her partnership with her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, in a firm 
called Aizoon.

Mr Urdangarin is already under investigation for 
allegedly using his position to embezzle several million dollars in 
public contracts assigned to a supposedly nonprofit foundation he set 
up.

The court cancelled a subpoena against the princess for questioning in that case last year.

The probes have seriously damaged the image of 76-year-old Juan Carlos, once one of Spain's most respected figures.

Cristina is the youngest of the King’s 
two daughters, behind Princess Elena, 49 . The King and wife Sofia also 
have a son, Prince Felipe, 45, who is heir to the throne.

In May last year judge Castro asked
 Spanish tax authorities for information regarding the princess's  
property and investments as well as her finances relating to business 
with Aizoon.

It is the first time a direct relative of the monarch has been ordered to court while accused of wrongdoing.

A
 poll released on Sunday revealed that almost two thirds of Spaniards 
want their king to abdicate and hand the crown to his son, with his 
popularity slumping to a record low.

King
 Juan Carlos, who has been on the throne for 38 years, was once one of 
the world's best-loved sovereigns, respected for his common touch and 
for helping guide Spain to democracy in the 1970s after the death of 
dictator Francisco Franco.

But Spaniards have become increasingly frustrated by the corruption investigation at a time of economic crisis and widespread unemployment.

Blow: The subpoena is a further blow to the Spanish Royal 
family after polls suggested most Spaniards would like King Carlos to abdicate

The
 king's approval rating also took a big hit in April 2012 when he fell 
and broke his hip during an elephant-hunting safari in Botswana - a 
lavish privately funded trip that was secret until his accident and came
 at a time of particularly harsh public spending cuts.

Sixty-two
 percent of those polled said they thought the king should step down, 
compared with 44.7 percent a year ago, according to the Sigma Dos poll 
published in El Mundo newspaper.

Only 41.3 percent of those polled had a good or very good opinion of the king, down from more than 76 percent two years ago.

Younger Spaniards, who were not alive during the Franco years, were overwhelmingly in favour of abdication, the poll showed.

Prince
 Felipe, 45, held on to a positive rating of 66 percent, and most of 
those polled said the monarchy could recover its prestige if he took the
 throne.

A series of hip 
and back operations and other health problems have fuelled speculation 
the king, 76, might abdicate, but in his annual Christmas Eve speech, he
 reiterated that he was not contemplating such a move.

The telephone poll of 1,000 adults was carried out between December 28-31.
