The parents of a girl who died of cancer at the age of 16 have published a heartbreaking series of letters written by the Massachusetts teenager as she came to terms with her disease.

Esther Earl refused to be defeated by cancer and became an online celebrity after posting YouTube videos from her bed when she was too ill to move.

Her support led to a $250,000 donation from her followers for a group of Harry Potter fans who champion social justice - and a letter of support from the books’ author J.K. Rowling.

Journey: Esther Earl's struggle with cancer is documented in a book made up of her letters and diaries

Esther kept a journal of her struggle and sent letters to her family, in which she wrote: ‘God means so much to me, but I wish He could heal me.'

She also wrote an email herself to be read when she turned 17, but she died before reaching that milestone. 

In it Esther wrote: ‘To be honest, I’m not even sure if future me will even be alive...

‘...There was so much more I wanted to say, and maybe I’ll send another one of these if anything happens. I love you, and I hope you turn out good.'

The emotional book was put together by her mother Lori, an educator, and father Wayne, a minister, to inspire others and tell them of Esther’s amazing spirit.

They set up the This Star Won't Go Out foundation in her name, to help families whose loved ones have cancer, and have raised thousands of dollars in Esther’s memory.

Esther's family remembered her as a ‘punky, energetic, creative kid’ with blue eyes and blonde hair, who never let the disease get the better of her.

She was born in Beverly, Massachusetts, and had two older sisters, Abby and Evangeline, and two younger brothers, Graham and Abraham. 

Her parents moved around for work, and were living in Marseilles, France, in 2006 when Esther was diagnosed with metastasized papillary thyroid cancer at the age of 12.

Her parents wrote that their ‘slim, 
muscular, energetic, never-tired 12-year-old found she was fatigued 
walking even a short distance'.

Wise words: Esther's parents have published a book of her letters

That November, Esther underwent surgery to remove her thyroid gland and lymph nodes on her neck, but suffered complications.

The family returned to Massachusetts where she underwent a grueling, almost weekly regime of radiotherapy at Boston Children’s Hospital because the cancer had spread through her body. 

In her diaries, Esther remains funny and incredibly upbeat, writing that she has a ‘great attitude about all this cancer thing’ and only has a ‘meltdown’ once a month.

She describes her cancer as a ‘stomach clenching thing’ and described how she was given ‘sleeping medicine’ by the nurses when she had operations.

In a letter to her mother on June 3, 2007, she wrote: ‘Your friendship is so very important to me and I wouldn’t have such a close one with you had it not been for all this.

‘And if I had the choice of going 
back in time, somehow, and preventing the cancer, I wouldn’t, since it 
would change so many things.'

In another diary entry she wrote: ‘I’m so scared. God means so much to me, but I wish He could heal me.'

Her bright days included a meal out to try lobster for the first time. Her family lugged five oxygen tanks with them to the restaurant to help her keep breathing through a nose filter.

She talked of wanting to go on dates with boys and have her first kiss, like any regular teenage girl.

Yet there were dark days too, when the teenager would sleep 12 hours a day from 2am to 2pm.

Her parents wrote that their lives revolved around reports on her blood counts, the results of tests and the precious time they had together.

Esther wrote: ‘I don’t ever cry during the day. If I have to, I hold it in and plan to cry that night.'

In another letter to her parents, in Christmas 2008, she said: ‘I may only live a short time. It sucks, man. But I mean it’s the truth, and the truth is icky…

‘...I do think about dying a lot but I don’t know. I feel like I’ve finally like, grasped that I’d no longer live on Earth. But I’m working on the actual progress of death and the people missing me part, you know?’

By 2008 Esther and her family agreed to try an experimental therapy in conjunction with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

Over Thanksgiving her condition took a turn for the worse and her family were called to her hospital bed to say their goodbyes - but she pulled through.

When she returned home her family turned the dining room into a bedroom as Esther could no longer walk up and down stairs. She had lost her hair and had to deal with nausea most days.

Esther spent her days reading Garfield comics and watching her favorite TV shows, What Not To Wear and Jon & Kate Plus 8.

Fun loving: The teenager was an internet hit thanks to her quirky YouTube videos

But she admitted to being lonely, and turned to the Internet where she created online identities, calling herself ‘crazycrayon’ and ‘cookie4monster4’.

The blogs and YouTube videos she posted about her progress were viewed tens of thousands of times. She even started an advice column in which people would write in asking her for tips. 

As a result, Esther said: ‘I really do feel feel like I have so much more in my life.'

The teenager founded a group of online friends called Catitude who became her closest confidants.

She worked with The Harry Potter Alliance. Together they successfully campaigned for a $250,000 grant from the Chase Community Giving foundation, beating 10,000 other organizations in a Facebook poll.

The outpouring of support for Esther was behind the surge in votes and it even drew the attention of the books' author J.K. Rowling.

She sent a hand-drawn picture of the Sorting Hat from the books and wrote underneath: ‘To Esther, with love and best wishes always - Jo’.

In February 2009 Esther’s MRI and CT scans showed the cancer had not spread to her brain, and by May that the multiple lung tumors had shrunk 15 percent after extensive chemotherapy.

She started taking algebra lessons and, by January 2010, was going to school three days a week.

But by April her health took a turn for the worse.

She was able to keep talking to her friends from her hospital bed until the end, and some of them met her in real life for the first time as they came to say goodbye as a part of a Make-A-Wish day.

Fans: Esther's fun-loving spirit touched thousands of lives and her videos helped the teenager feel less lonely

In her last video post recorded on 
August 9, 2010, Esther said: ‘If you are a person with feelings, I kind 
of urge you to, like, write this, write in your diary or your blog post 
or a video or on a Post-it, like your feelings, because it feels good to
 just like, kind of see what they are, and even if you can’t figure out 
all of them, because, holy crap the brain has a lot of feelings!

‘...I will see you guys tomorrow. Probably.'

Esther died on a warm summer’s night, August 25, 2010, surrounded by her family.

Describing her final hours, her parents wrote how she woke from a sleep to say: ‘I’m going, I’m going.'

They decided to turn off her respiratory machine, which had been keeping her breathing.

They
 wrote: ‘After several minutes of waiting, crying quietly and touching 
our beloved Star, she breathed out one final, unusually long breath, 
like she was giving it up, offering it, being pulled forward into a 
newer, richer life. 

‘Her 
dying appeared to us more like a birth than a death, a kind of willing 
submission, a sense that her struggle was complete and that it was OK to
 finish this final battle.'

Last word: In her final YouTube video, made a couple of weeks before she died, Esther urged others to write down their feelings too

Esther has already been the subject of another book, The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green, who had befriended her.

Green said that his book was fiction and those wanting to know the real story of Esther should read the new work.

In his moving introduction to the book, Green wrote that Esther’s death showed him that a ‘short life can also be a good and rich life’.

He wrote: ‘When we think of death, we often imagine it as happening in degrees: We think of a sick person becoming less and less alive until finally they are gone. 

‘But even in her final days, Esther was wholly alive, as alive as anyone else, and so even though everyone who loved her understood she was dying, her death was still a terrible shock to me. 

‘She did not leave slowly, but all at once, because even when she could not get out of bed, she found ways to be fully alive: to play with her friends, to crack jokes, to love and to be loved. And then she was gone, all at once.’

In an introduction to the book, Esther's parents paid tribute to their daughter as a ‘champion of the lonely, a welcomer of strangers, an inviter’.

They wrote that her diary reflected the ‘perspective of a joyful young girl forced to navigate the monstrous reality of a cancer death sentence’.

‘Her life was a book. She didn’t get to choose the ending, but the way she filled the pages makes her story irresistible,' they wrote.

This Star Won't Go Out, by Lori and Wayne Earl, is published by Dutton Juvenile.
