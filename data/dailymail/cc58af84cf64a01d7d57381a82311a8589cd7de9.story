The world's oldest human DNA has been recovered from the thigh bone of an ancestor that walked the Earth 400,000 years ago.

It belonged to a hominin, or early human, known as Homo heidelbergensis and provides a new vital piece of the jigsaw in the story of evolution.

Using a technique for retrieving and sequencing highly degraded ancient DNA, scientists were able to reconstruct the almost complete mitochondrial (mt) genome from just two grams of bone powder.

The findings, published in Nature, are unexpected because as early hominins looked a bit like Neanderthals, their mtDNA was expected to share a common ancestor.

But the creature dug up in an underground cave in northern Spain known as the 'Pit of Bones' was found to share a common ancestor with the Neanderthals' mysterious Asian sister group, the Denisovans, dating back about 700,000 years.

From the missing mutations in the old DNA sequences the researchers were able to calculate when the 'Pit of Bones' hominin lived.

The DNA was recovered from a 400,000-year-old thigh bone dug upÂ  in an underground cave in northern Spain known as the 'Pit of Bones'.

The Pit of Bones a 12-meter deep vertical shaft which turns into an inclined passage 10 meters in length opening onto a chamber measuring 15 square meters.

The cave at the Atapuerca Mountains, or 'Sima de los Huesos' in Spanish, has already yielded the world's biggest collection of Middle Pleistocene fossils. Aa total of 28 skeletons, so further DNA extractions may be possible.

Mitochondrial DNA can only be passed from a mother to her children and produces the power plants of cells.

Evolutionary anthropologist Dr Matthias Meyer, of the Max Planck Institute, Leipzig, Germany, said: 'The fact the mtDNA of the hominin shares a common ancestor with Denisovan rather than Neanderthal mtDNAs is unexpected since its skeletal remains carry Neanderthal derived features.'

Considering their age and Neanderthal like features, the H heidelbergensis was likely related to both Neanderthals and Denisovans.

Another possibility is gene flow from yet another group of hominins brought the Denisovan mtDNA into the 'Pit of Bones' hominins or their ancestors.

DNA this old has until recently been retrieved only from the permafrost.

The study pushes our understanding of the genetics of human evolution some 200,000 years further back from the Late to the Middle Pleistocene.

The cave at Sierra de Atapuerca, 'Sima de los Huesos' in Spanish, has already yielded the world's biggest collection of Middle Pleistocene fossils, a total of 28 skeletons, so further DNA extractions may be possible.

They have been excavated and pieced together over the course of more than two decades by a Spanish team of paleontologists led by Juan-Luis Arsuaga.

The fossils are classified as H heidelbergensis but also carry traits typical of Neanderthals. Until now it had not been possible to study the DNA of these unique hominins.

Dr Meyer's team first joined forces with palaeontologist Professor Juan-Luis Arsuaga, of the Complutense University of Madrid, to apply his technique to a cave bear dug up at the 'Pit of Bones' which came along 100,000 years later, about 300,000 years ago.

After this success, the researchers sampled the hominin thigh bone from the cave. They extracted its DNA and sequenced the genome of mtDNA and then compared the ancient material with Neanderthals, Denisovans, modern humans and apes.

Professor Svante Paabo, director at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, said: 'Our results show we can now study DNA from human ancestors hundreds of thousands of years old. This opens prospects to study the genes of the ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans.

'It is tremendously exciting.'

H. heidelbergensis was first discovered near Heidelberg, Germany, in 1907 and lived in Africa, Europe and western Asia and may date back up to 1,300,000 years before dying out about 250,000 years ago. Males grew around 5ft 9in tall and females 5ft 2in.

Little is known about the Denisovans because only a finger bone and some teeth have been found but they are believed to have been widespread in Siberia and Asia, and may have been interbreeding with humans as recently as 50,000 years ago.

Professor Arsuaga added: 'This unexpected result points to a complex pattern of evolution in the origin of Neanderthals and modern humans. I hope more research will help clarify the genetic relationships of the hominins from Sima de los Huesos to Neanderthals and Denisovans.'

The researchers are now pursuing this goal by focusing on retrieving DNA from more individuals from the site and also nuclear DNA at the cell's centre which drives an organism's biochemistry.

This was suprising as early humans were thought to share a common ancestor with Neanderthals due to similar skeletal features
