Lawyers for the mommy blogger accused for killing her 5-year-old son with an overdose of salt tried to portray her as loving and concerned using internet activity and text message conversations around the time of the boy's death.

Lacey Spears of Chestnut Ridge, New York is currently on trial for the murder of her son Garnett, who died of sodium poisoning last year. 

Prosecutors introduced cell phone activity to the jury on Thursday, arguing that searches about 'dangers of high sodium' and 'hypernatremia' carried out nine days before her son's death proves she planned the attack.

Jurors were shown pictures of Garnett (right) for the first time on Thursday 

But Spears' attorneys told the jury that the searches were evidence that Spears loved her child, and wanted to know what was wrong with him. 

They also pointed to a text message Spears sent right after her son died, on January 25, which read:  'I love him!!! He's my entire world, my soul!!!!! I lived for him!!!'

They said Spears was so torn up about the loss of her son, that she googled different ways to commit suicide including by overdose of sleeping pills and self-injecting insulin. 

Thursday's court session also marked the first time that jurors were shown pictures of little Garnett, showing the blonde-haired blue-eyed boy looking healthy, eating and painting, just two weeks before his death. 

The most recent picture shown of the boy to the court was taken on January 25, 2014 in the hospital with his eyes closed and jaw slack. 

Garnett's aunt, Lacey's sister Becky, wiped tears from her eyes as she saw the pictures in court, according to The Journal News.

During the next court session, jurors are expected to be shown surveillance footage from the hospital which shows Spears taking her son to the bathroom and holding his stomach tube which prosecutors claim she used to feed him the massive quantities of salt. 

At one point in the as-yet-seen video, Garnett apparently screams as he lies down with his mother looking over him 'like a scientific experiment'. 

During opening statements on Tuesday,  Assistant District Attorney Doreen Lloyd said Spears  researched, planned, carried out and tried to cover up the killing of her son. Spears, Lloyd said, calmly 'watched and waited' for the poisoning to take effect, summoning help only after he began writhing and retching, a prosecutor said on Tuesday.

Defense lawyer Stephen Riebling told the jurors there are no eyewitnesses and no direct evidence that the 27-year-old Spears poisoned her son.

He added: 'There is no evidence in this case that legitimately answers the question "Why?''

Riebling also appeared to blame the hospital, in the New York suburbs near the Spearses' Chestnut Ridge home, noting it was only there that a high sodium level was detected.

The defense lawyer said the prosecution case was 'riddled with reasonable doubt.'

The Spearses lived in Chestnut Ridge at the time of Garnett's death. Lacey Spears moved to Kentucky afterward and was living there when she was arrested.

Garnett's death ended a short life filled with doctor and hospital visits that his mother tirelessly documented in thousands of postings on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and a blog.

Many of the postings will be used in evidence, along with Spears' online research into the dangers of sodium in children and hospital records from New York, Florida and Spears' native Alabama.

Also in evidence is a feeding bag prosecutors believe was used to hold the salt — and which they say she tried to hide after Garnett's death.

Defense attorneys have insisted that there will be no mention of Munchausen by proxy, a disorder in which caretakers secretly harm children to win sympathy. Some experts believe that disorder fits Spears' actions.
