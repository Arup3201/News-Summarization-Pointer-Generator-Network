Killed: Paul Thrower, 46, pictured, died after two 18-year-olds hacked at him with a 4ft axe and stabbed him 10 times at a block of flats in Hayes, Middlesex

Three teenagers killed a man with an axe after he became angry at them for spitting and swearing at his girlfriend. 

Paul Thrower died after two 18-year-olds hacked at him with a 4ft axe and stabbed him 10 times at a block of flats in Hayes, Middlesex, in scenes reminiscent of Hollywood horror film The Shining.  

Zakariya Subeir and Kiro Halliburton claimed they acted in self defence when Mr Thrower came at them in a rage, smashing through a reinforced glass partition they were hiding behind. 

Following a trial at the Old Bailey Halliburton, who delivered the fatal knife wound on 20 February, was found guilty of the murder. 

Subeir and an accomplice, Mahdi Osman, also 18, were found not guilty of murder but convicted of manslaughter.

A 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was cleared of involvement in the killing.

The court heard how the victim had been drinking and became very angry when his girlfriend, Geraldine Roberts, told him the youths swore, spat and threw a drink at her earlier that day.

When Mr Thrower confronted them, Subeir and Halliburton shut themselves into a bin chute on a first-floor communal balcony of a block of flats in St Dunstan's Close.

As the 46-year-old hammered on the glass partition with his fist, the 17-year-old found an axe in a shed. 

Osman passed it up to Subeir, who had managed to get on to the roof of the adjoining porch.

Osman told the court that he only handed over the weapon to help his friends barricade themselves into the balcony - not to attack Mr Thrower.

Murder weapon: A 17-year-old, who was cleared of his involvement in the killing, found the axe (above). Osman passed it up to Subeir, who struck Mr Thrower twice on the head and once on the shoulder

But when Mr Thrower smashed the reinforced glass and began to crawl through the gap, Subeir hit him twice on the head and once on the shoulder with the axe. Halliburton stabbed him repeatedly in the back with a knife.

Halliburton said he delivered the fatal stab to the chest after Mr Thrower grabbed the axe from Subeir, who then ran off.

He told jurors that Mr Thrower had the axe in one hand and him in the other and he did not know what else to do.

The victim emerged from the bin chute covered in blood, staggering, holding the axe before he collapsed and died from a stab to the heart.

As the defendants ran away, Ms Roberts chased after them. She was one of a number of residents who had called 999 to alert police, who arrived within minutes.

The defendants said that they fled the scene because they thought they would not be believed.

Halliburton shaved off his plaits and fled to Leeds in Yorkshire. When he was apprehended, he gave a false name.

On the run: One of the teenagers flees the block of flats after the attack. Subeir flew to Somalia, via Dubai, but came back about three weeks later and was arrested on the plane at Heathrow airport

The red-handled lock knife he used to kill Mr Thrower has never been recovered.

Subeir flew to Somalia, via Dubai, but came back about three weeks later and was arrested on the plane at Heathrow airport.

The 17-year-old and Osman went to ground and were arrested five days after the attack.

All the defendants apart from Halliburton had been involved in an incident earlier that evening at a nearby pub. 

They were asked to leave and  a landlord said one of them threatened to 'shank or jook' him - street slang for stabbing - while they were standing outside.

Residents of St Dunstan’s Close had complained about anti-social behaviour from groups of youths in the years leading up to the murder.

The court heard that Halliburton had two previous convictions of possessing a knife or bladed weapon in 2012.

Subeir, of Uxbridge, Halliburton and Osman, both of Hayes, and the 17-year-old had all denied murder.

Judge John Bevan adjourned sentencing until Friday December 19 so that pre-sentence reports can be prepared.

He said all the defendants were 'very young' and Halliburton would inevitably be detained while the other two were likely to face a determinate sentence.
