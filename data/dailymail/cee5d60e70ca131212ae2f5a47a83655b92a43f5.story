Michael Carrick has revealed his dream Manchester United five-a-side team - and it doesn't include a goalkeeper or any of his defensive team-mates.

The Manchester United midfielder has become the latest Old Trafford star to pick four of his colleagues to play alongside him in what would be his ideal five-a-side team.

And Carrick, speaking to Manchester United's official website, has said he would go 'all-out attack'.

Radamel Falcao, Angel di Maria, Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney have all been given the nod to start alongside the 33-year-old Manchester United vice-captain.

Carrick has repaid the faith shown in him by Van Persie, who named the deep-lying midfielder in his team along with David de Gea, Rooney and Falcao.

England ace Rooney has also recently selected his five-a-side team with the United captain also failing to select a defender or goalkeeper.

Rooney said: 'Do you have to have a goalkeeper? If not, I’ll go for Angel [di Maria], [Radamel] Falcao, Robin [van Persie] and [Juan] Mata.'

Carrick, who played the full 90 minutes in United's 2-0 win against QPR on Saturday, has said he enjoys the 'competitive' nature of training at the Aon Training Complex.

'Everyone’s competitive,' said Carrick. 'There isn’t really anyone at the minute that stands out but that’s not to say it isn't competitive.

'Every day you want to win and come out on top in training. 

'That's why nobody really stands out, everyone’s trying to do as well as everyone else.'
