A young mother-of-four was brutally tortured with a knife before she was murdered and left to rot in a shallow bushland grave north of Brisbane.

Police will allege 28-year-old Tia Landers suffered a violent ordeal, which saw her legs cut and her body dragged into the shower because she was 'bleeding profusely' before she was shot twice, a police source has told MailOnline.

Ms Landers had been missing for a month before her body was found in a state forest at Beerburrum, north of Brisbane, on Thursday.

Police allege Tia Landers suffered a violent death and was shot twice before being taken to a shallow grave

The body of Tia Landers was found following a search of state forest at Beerburrum, south of the Sunshine Coast, after she was reported missing on June 19

Brisbane couple John Edward Harris, 42, and Linda Eileen Appleton, 40, who were known to Ms Landers, have been charged with torturing and murdering her and will spend at least the next six months behind bars after they were remanded in custody during a court mention on Friday.

The couple did not appear in the Redcliffe Magistrates Court, where the matter was adjourned until January 12.

Police say Ms Landers went willingly to a home at Brighton, north of Brisbane.

Officers who've combed the property say there are signs she was brutally tortured there.

'There's evidence that there has been violence,' Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen told reporters.

'The offenders have been charged with torture.'

Ms Landers' 19-year-old sister is desperate for answers. Jamie Landers was at the court on Friday and said her family want to find out why Ms Landers was killed.

'We want to know why. Tia's done a lot of bad stuff in her life, we all know that (but) it's not to be held against her,' she told reporters outside the court.

Speaking to MailOnline on Friday, Jamie paid tribute to her caring big sister who bought her up when their father got sick with cancer.

I am devastated… I helped her raise her kids, she was the best mum, they adored her, she was always spoiling them and making them princess dresses,’ Jamie said.

The mother of four had been missing for a month before her body was found

Jamie described her sister as a popular and outgoing young women and said when she was murdered it wasn’t just Tia’s life that was taken but ‘a piece of all her family’.

‘She has so many friends, everyone knows her for being bubbly, out there, and having fun and living in a dream world.

‘So many people are missing her at the moment,’ she said.

A friend of the slain woman has told ABC radio she was a loving mother.

'I've known her for eight years, she was there for me always, ups, downs,' Angela Dicker said. 'Loving mother, loving daughter, loves her parents, loves her family.'

Ms Landers was last seen at midday on June 16 in the Redcliffe and Deception Bay area when CCTV cameras recorded her walking into a petrol station.

Police held grave fears for her safety after it was revealed she suffered from a medical condition, believed to be schizophrenia. They spent almost three weeks looking for her before they made the grisly discovery.

Ms Landers was previously accused of being involved in a violent home robbery

Supt Hansen said Ms Landers was no stranger to the couple charged with her murder.

'She's an associate of theirs. They're known to each other, have been known to each other for some time,' he said.

He said police had put Ms Landers in the high risk category after she went missing.

A month before Ms Landers was last seen, she failed to appear in court as Wade Bartz's co-accused in a violent home robbery.

The case was heard in the Supreme Court but charges against Mr Bartz were dropped after a witness identified his photo on Ms Landers’ Facebook page.

In May, Mr Bartz posted a photo of Tia on his Facebook profile with the caption: 'My world stops spinning when your not around.'

But on her own profile she listed herself as in a 'complicated relationship'.

Her family had set up a Facebook campaign to appeal for public help in finding Ms Landers and her disappearance is unrelated to Mr Bartz, who is currently behind bars.

A post-mortem examination is being carried out after Ms Landers' body was found in a state forest at Beerburrum, north of Brisbane, on Thursday
