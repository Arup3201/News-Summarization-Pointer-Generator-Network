Moscow last night warned that plans for European sanctions on Russia’s banks, oligarchs and defence sector will make the global financial crisis worse.

European ambassadors gathered in Brussels yesterday to hammer out a tough new package aimed at bringing some of the country’s leading banks to their knees.

Officials also agreed travel bans and asset freezes on a number of senior figures, including Vladimir Putin’s spy chief.

But in a menacing intervention, Russia’s ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakovenko suggested the West will suffer more if it presses ahead with sanctions that Moscow considers ‘illegal, unreasonable and counterproductive’.

Mr Yakovenko did not specify whether Russia would retaliate, although Moscow has the power to cause chaos by turning off the gas supplies that many EU countries rely on.

But at a Press conference in London, he said: ‘In my view the sectoral sanctions against Russia may well trigger a long anticipated end-game of the present global crisis.’

It was also reported last night that  Moscow could take retaliatory action against British firms operating in Russia such as Shell and BP.

A diplomatic source told the Telegraph: ‘We want friendly relations. We will go along as far as we can then we will retaliate.’

Mr Yakovenko also denied that Moscow was arming the separatists suspected of shooting down flight MH17 and accused the West of trying to cover up the true causes of the crash.

His comments came as it emerged proposed EU sanctions on Russia’s state-owned banks go much further than expected. Leaked documents reveal plans to restrict their ‘access to capital markets’.

They would be banned from issuing new bonds in the EU, a market worth £6billion last year. The move would affect four major  banks including Sberbank and VTB, both listed on the London Stock Exchange.

But proposals to curb defence exports are much less draconian, and will allow France to press ahead with a controversial £1billion warship deal, which David Cameron described as ‘unthinkable’.

French Foreign Minister Larent Fabius hit back with a thinly-veiled attack on Britain’s role in the 2003 Iraq war. In the coming days Brussels is expected to publish an initial list of about 15 senior Putin allies who will face travel bans and asset freezes.

It is understood to include the head of Russia’s feared secret service Alexander Bortnikov, although critics pointed out he does not travel abroad.

Meanwhile, Boris Johnson last night defended his plans to take part in a £160,000 tennis match in a Tory Party fundraiser with the wife of one of Mr Putin’s former ministers.

The London Mayor insisted the Foreign Office had been asked to check Vladimir Chernukhin was no longer an associate of the Russian leader. But critics said it was extraordinary that the Tories were apparently using the Foreign Office as a ‘private investigator’ to vet party donors.
