England boss Roy Hodgson has been getting some social media stick for his decision to watch Chelsea's Champions League clash with Maribor at Stamford Bridge. 

The only English player to start the game was John Terry, who retired from international duty in September 2012 after being cleared of racially abusing then-QPR defender Anton Ferdinand during a match.

So who was Hodgson keeping tabs on at the Bridge?

England's next Euro 2016 qualification match is on November 15 against Slovenia, where Chelsea's opponents on Tuesday, Maribor, hail from. 

They were unbeaten in eight Champions League games this season before they ventured to west London, and three of their starting XI on Tuesday were included in the Slovenia squad for qualification matches against Switzerland and Lithuania earlier this month. 

Mitja Viler

The left-back was at fault for the first goal as Loic Remy cut in from the right-hand side, pushed the ball on to his left foot and then curled a shot into the far corner. 

Viler was then unfortunate enough to turn Eden Hazard's shot into his own net to make it 4-0 shortly after the break. 

Subbed off in the 56th minute.

Maribor's central-midfield pair were always going to struggle against the likes of Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas, two of the most in-form midfielders in not just England but also Europe.

Chelsea dominated the centre of the pitch as Mertelj and Filipovic failed to cope with their pace and power. The visitors also created very little going forward as their midfield repeatedly gave the ball away cheaply.

So, all in all, not much to worry about for Roy.
