Today show host Savannah Guthrie threw an impromptu party for her daughter live on air on Friday morning in celebration of baby Vale’s six-month birthday.

Both mother and daughter were grinning from ear to ear, while Vale had the chance to meet the team’s yellow Labrador puppy Wrangler, hang out with Sesame Street's Cookie Monster and pal around with her 43-year-old mom’s co-hosts Tamron Hall, Matt Lauer and Al Roker during her special visit to the studio in New York City.

'She's 18 pounds of pure, cute, beautiful cheeks,' Al said of Savannah's adorable daughter.

Major milestone: The little girl, who was born last August, celebrated her six-month birthday on Friday

When the new mom brought out Vale, her co-hosts immediately began gushing over the precious baby.

'Vale has made the scene on her six-month anniversary,' Matt announced. 

'It's hard to believe it’s six months already,' Al noted as Savannah helped her daughter to show her fellow anchors how 'she likes to stand tall'. 

'How does she feel about little blue stuffed animals?' Matt asked the new mom before he presented the little girl with a plush Cookie Monster.

Thoughtful present: Matt gifted the baby a small Cookie Monster stuffed animal before she met the iconic character in person

Vale was then introduced to the real Cookie Monster - who also fell in love with the little girl.

'You're so pretty,' the puppet told her. 

And Vale was equally memorized by the iconic blue character. 

But while Vale was overcome with excitement at meeting the Cookie Monster and the team’s new canine companion, Savannah was most delighted to see that her daughter's face had been placed on the show’s special jar of Smucker's jelly, which they use to celebrate milestone birthdays and anniversaries.

The six-month-old wore a black and white polka dot dress featuring a red rose applique that was provided by Savannah's sister.

She kept her little legs warm with white tights and socks that resembled red Mary Jane flats.

Before her daughter’s appearance on the show, Savannah tweeted to her nearly 350,000 followers: 'A tiny lady is making a cameo later this morning.'

Savannah and her husband Michael Feldman, 46, welcomed Vale last year on August 13 and their daughter soon became a Today Show fan favorite. 

She is also the star of her mom's Twitter and Instagram feeds, where her major milestones have been documented for the world to see.

Vale made her Today Show debut last September as a surprise for Savannah's co-hosts on the show's Guess the Guest segment.

She even met Ben Affleck, who was promoting his film Gone Girl at the time.

Savannah and Michael first revealed that she was four months pregnant with Vale last year on their wedding day.

Over the past couple of years, the Today show has seen something of a baby boom. 

Correspondent Jenna Wolfe, 40, and her partner Stephanie Gosk, 41, welcomed their second child, a baby girl named Quinn Lily Wolfeld-Gosk, earlier this month.

Their first daughter, Harper Estelle Wolfeld-Gosk, was born on August 21, 2013.
