Arsene Wenger will insist Luis Suarez adheres strictly to Arsenal's values if the Liverpool striker completes a move to the Emirates.

The prolific but controversial Uruguayan is one of Wenger's top transfer targets this summer, with Arsenal already seeing a bid of £40million plus one pound rejected.

Liverpool maintain Suarez, who scored 30 goals in all competitions last season, won't be sold for less than £50m but should he pursue a return to Champions League football at the Emirates, he will have to fall in to line.VIDEO Scroll down to watch Suarez will respect Arsenal club values: Wenger

Golfer Ian Poulter expressed the frustrations of many fellow Arsenal supporters on Friday as he criticised the club's unambitious transfer policy on Twitter.

He wrote: 'No point checking the sport section on the Internet to check who Arsenal may have signed. Losing interest in what a great club stood for.'

'Promised big signings for start of season. Oh no we won't we will say yet again the squad is strong enough. Scrap for 4th again oh joy.'

'I'm not sure Arsenal can afford Suarez food bill let alone wages.'

Speaking ahead of this weekend's 
Emirates Cup tournament, Wenger said: 'We have values that we want our 
players to respect. No matter where they come from we will be of course 
very touchy on that.

'This club has built a reputation not 
only over my years here but over 130 years, and values that are very 
important for this club have to be respected by every player, no matter 
where they come from.

'And that will be with every potential signing.'

Suarez was suspended for eight matches
and fined £40,000 in October 2011 after being found guilty of racially 
abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. 

He courted more controversy last 
season after appearing to bite Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic 
during a match at Anfield, and was banned for 10 games.

Wenger also suggested that the mooted £87million transfer of Tottenham star Gareth Bale to Real Madrid will make a mockery of UEFA's impending Financial Fair Play regulations.

'It makes a joke of it,' he said. 'It's quite amazing in the year when Financial Fair Play comes in, world football goes completely crazy.

'You wonder what kind of impact and effect it has on the football world. It looks like it has made everybody worse than before.'

Despite also being linked to Wayne Rooney and Gonzalo Higuain, Arsenal's only summer buy to date has been the Auxerre striker Yaya Sanogo, who joined on a free.

Sanogo will likely feature against Napoli and Galatasaray in the Emirates Cup this weekend and Wenger said the fans will be impressed.

'There are two ways for us to strengthen our team. The first is internal. We finished with 73 points, with a very strong run, but I feel that because we are a very good core of young players we can still improve. Transfer stability.

'Second part is of course to strengthen our squad from outside. We have signed Yaya Sanogo – he has not made headlines. Why? Because he is not £50 to £100million. I’m quite confident he will make them soon on the pitch.

'Sanogo will surprise you, because your expectation doesn’t look to be high. He will not surprise me because my expectation is very high. He’s a top class striker.

'There is still one month to go. We are working very hard to strengthen our squad.'

With the season just a fortnight away, Wenger said midfielder Jack Wilshere is still not 100 per cent fit, while defender Thomas Vermaelen will miss another six weeks with a stress fracture in the back.

Nacho Monreal is scheduled to return to training on Monday.
