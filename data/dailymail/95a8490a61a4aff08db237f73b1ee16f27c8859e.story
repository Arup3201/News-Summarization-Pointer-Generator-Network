This is the moment a group of Russians captured video footage of what they believed was a Yeti walking through the woods.

The footage shows a 'bear-like' figure covered in hair emerging from an area of snow-covered trees in the south-western Adygeya Republic before disappearing again seconds later.

A team had set out in search of the mysterious creature after local television reported that it had been sighted in a remote region an hour's drive away from the city of Adygeisk.

Sighting: A team of Russians believe they have captured footage of the elusive Yeti in a remote patch of woodland

They said they had questioned residents at a mountainside lodge who claimed to have seen it - and on speaking to others in the area managed to secure reports of several independent sightings.

The group claim they heard the crunching of snow as they headed out to investigate before capturing footage of the creature, which they describe as covered in hair. 

Afterwards, they took a plaster cast of a large footprint they said they found in the snow.

Eyewitness Ludmila Hristoforova who spoke to local television said: 'The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we've seen something big and shaggy.'

Homeowner Andrei Kazarian said: 'I heard footsteps and we were pretty sure there was no one else around because we knew for sure everyone else was inside the house.

'Although we didn't see anyone we saw its huge footprints. They were five to six centimetres deep and couldn't come from a human foot.

After capturing the creature on camera, the team claim to have taken a plaster cast of its footprint

The plaster cast and the footage have now been handed to local scientists and will go to the local council by the end of the month

Big foot? Some have suggested the video was just a stunt to bring in tourists while others are convinced this was the first proof that the yeti exists in the area

'We took a plaster cast of them and we estimate that it probably would have taken about 200 kilos to press the snow down that much.' 

The plaster cast and the footage have now been handed to local scientists and will go to the local council by the end of the month.

The footage has already sparked debate with some suggesting it was just a stunt to bring in tourists and others convinced this was the first proof that the yeti exists in the area.
