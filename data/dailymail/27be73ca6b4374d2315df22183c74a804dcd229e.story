A cat left to die in a ditch by callous owners must wear woolly jumpers to survive because her fur was so matted and tangled rescuers had to shave it off.

The cat, who has been named Freida the Throw Away Kitty, was last month found underweight and abandoned in a ditch in rural Maine, a mile from the nearest house.

She was taken in by animal rescue charity Forgotten Felines of Maine, who said: 'She was emaciated and matted and weighed less than 2lbs. She did not walk to that ditch by herself.

Costly cat: The group, which describes itself as a 'small grassroots organization' has already stumped up over $1,000 towards vets bills for Freida, who is suffering from a range of health problems

'Thank God for the man [who found her] taking a walk that day. He saved her life.'

The group, which describes itself as a 'small grassroots organization' has already stumped up over $1,000 towards vets bills for Freida, who is suffering from a range of health problems.

Because her tangled fur was so painful and irritating they were forced to shave most of her body and she not wears jumpers to keep her warm and protect her sensitive skin.

For days after she was found she ran a high fever and her anaemia meant that vets were unable to draw more than a single cc of blood at a time for diagnostic tests.

Although she is in fact fully grown, her health problems mean she looks like she is still only a tiny kitten.

Social media star: Freida's plight has been highlighted by a Facebook fan page which at the time of writing has so far attracted over 1,500 likes. She is pictured on the page wearing a range of jumpers

She needs your help: Freida pictured shortly after her rescue. She is suffering from a malfunctioning liver and an enlarged gall bladder that mean she will need a lifetime of care

Forgotten Felines is now appealing to the public for more cash to help Freida, who they say will need a life time of care.

'She has Multifocal portal venule hypoplasia and arteriolar hyperplasia (reduplication); mild bile ductular hyperplasia,' volunteers said on a Facebook page set up to highlight the forlorn feline's plight.

'In essence her liver doesn't work. Her gall bladder is hundreds of times larger than it should be.

'Freida needs much more vet care and treatment and we really need your continued support. If you think Freida should have a chance live please help us help her.'
