An elementary school teacher is under investigation after bashing students for being slow learners and calling a parent a 'crack head' on Facebook.

The teacher at Alicante Avenue Elementary School in Lamont, California, made the posts in late August, according to screenshots of the messages obtained by the local ABC affiliate, which did not name the teacher. The school did not respond to a request for comment from MailOnline.

The teacher complains in one post about a parent who pulled her daughter from his class because she was 'terrified' of him and he 'made her work.'

'What an idiot!!' the teacher writes. 'Little does she know about her children's scores that they are both horrible students with the worst study and behavior habits.'

'I also love the fact that she forgot to mention that her angel was being suspended for grabbing a girl's breast. No how many of you parents out there would like it if this little [redacted word] grabbed your daughter's breast? Hmm? Anybody? Exactly. 

'So to this crack head parents... learn how to raise your children instead of going in and out of jail all the time! Plus SHUT THE @$&! UP you moron!!!! Now back to a lovely day.'
