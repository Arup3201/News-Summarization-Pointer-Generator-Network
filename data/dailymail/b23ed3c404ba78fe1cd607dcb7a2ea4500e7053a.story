Mark Hughes is hoping to take full advantage of Sunderland's struggles in front of goal as he prepares to take his Stoke side back to Wearside for the second time in under two weeks.

While the Potters head north on a high in the wake of Monday night's 1-0 win over Newcastle at the Britannia Stadium, their opponents are looking for their first league win of the season.

And Hughes believes his side's counter-attacking style of play is perfectly suited to capitalising on any frustrations felt by the Black Cats as they push for points at the Stadium of Light.

Hughes, who led his side to a 2-1 win over the same opponents in last month's Capital One Cup clash, told his club's official website: 'They seem to be struggling at the moment and drawing a lot of games. If they are a bit blunt up front hopefully we can capitalise on that.

'We're very much in a positive frame of mind after Monday and we're going into a game against opponents we have played quite recently and overcome.

'It's different in the Premier League - they will make changes and we probably will as well - and they will want to make amends but that may help us to a certain extent because we will always be a threat on the break.'

Potters full-back Phil Bardsley spent six years at Sunderland before leaving for the Britannia Stadium this summer and has already tasted victory against his former club having played a full part in the cup success.

And the Scotland international wants more of the same this time.

'We have already been up there once this season and managed to win the game, so hopefully we can use that to our advantage in this game too,' he told Stoke City Player.

'It was a little bit strange when we went up there last week for the cup game because I spent so long up there, and still have a lot of people I am close to at the club.

'I'm a professional footballer though and I am a Stoke City player now. My only priority is doing everything I possibly can to help us record the three points from the game.'

Monday's win over Sunderland's north-east neighbours came at a price with Mame Biram Diouf limping off with an injury which will keep him out of Saturday's clash.

But Hughes expressed relief that initial scans on the Senegal international indicate he ought to be ready to return for the Premier League clash with Swansea after the international break.

Hughes added: 'With Mame it's not as serious as we initially thought. He pulled up sharply and when that happens you fear he will be out for any number of weeks.

'But he stopped immediately and came off which was the right thing to do. The scans show there's something there but it's not one that's going to take too long we hope.'
