We all know that the most effective ways to lose weight is by doing more and eating less but many people can't muster the motivation to step foot in the gym or go on that first run.

Now one woman has found a simple way of motivating herself to keep fit - by being hypnotised in to wanting to exercise

27-year-old Danielle Davies hated exercise but she has shed an amazing five stone after being hypnotised into a doing a string of energetic workouts.

New-found fitness fanatic: Danielle Davies, 27, has transformed the way she looks using Hypnocise- a new technique that uses hypnotherapy to help you exercise

The teaching assistant, 27, used to recoil at thought of any exercise - despite tipping the scales at 14 stone due to her love of alcohol and takeaways.

But her mother, Bev, 49, who has worked as hypnotherapist for 20 years decided she had to help her daughter who she believed was putting her life at risk.

First she hypnotised her into believing she had a gastric band fitted, then she bewitched her into doing exercises in a fitness programme she called 'hypnocise.'

Bev would play her daughter a hypnotherapy CD, which prepared her both mentally and physically - sparking Danielle into completing workout sessions which ended up lasting up to 60 minutes.

Shedding the pounds: Danielle went from a size 18 weighing 14 stone, to a size six weighing eight stone, by using a virtual gastric band and Hypnocise

Now 5ft 5” tall Danielle can fit into the slinkiest of size six dresses and loves to show off her incredible figure after weighing in at nine stone.

The new fitness fanatic says she can feel her muscles tensing even before she has started doing the exercise, as just listening to the CD can make her feel as though she has already done 100 crunches.

Danielle, from Rotherham, South Yorks said: ‘I was the laziest person I knew, I hated exercise and could never be bothered.

‘But with hypnocise it’s really different, it puts all the thoughts and motivation into your mind and gets you ready to exercise.

‘It’s crazy, I can feel my body preparing itself. I’ll think about doing crunches and it will feel as if I’ve already done some.

Gaining weight: After getting her first job and moving in with her friends at 19-years-old, Danielle began to pile on the pounds as she gorged on takeaways every night and drank alcohol every weekend

‘It puts suggestions in your mind that you want to exercise and tells you how much better you will feel for it.

‘It sounds insane but it really works, my body shape has changed completely.

‘People think I’m a gym nut or someone who goes on really long runs but all I do is half an hour to an hour each night at home.’

After getting her first job and moving in with her friends at 19-years-old, Danielle began to pile on the pounds as she gorged on takeaways every night and drank alcohol every weekend.

But Danielle didn’t notice her changing figure until people started to make comments on her size - with an old friend even stopping her in the street to say she was worried about her health and overhearing men in clubs calling her ‘fatty.’

Danielle listens to the Hypnocise CD before she works out which puts thoughts into her mind that she wants to get fit, motivated and feel like she has more energy - preparing her to work out.

Unaware: Danielle didn't notice her changing figure until people started to make comments on her size - with an men in clubs calling her 'fatty'. Now she is a svelte size 6

Now Danielle says she can’t go a single day without exercising or she becomes irritable and moody.

Danielle said: 'At the time I lived with my friends, when I started putting weight on, I was probably in my late teens.

'I had a job and I had money for the first time and I lived on takeaways, all the worst kinds of food.

'I would have breakfast and then a snack and then dinner and then I’d snack through until tea, which would probably be a takeaway. It was always convenience food.

'I was going through that time in your life when you suddenly have a job and money and I started to go out with my friends and drink.

'I always used to feel like the ugly one but now I feel incredible'

 

'It was all a novelty, it was all new and exciting. And the weight just slowly crept on.

I just didn’t realise what was happening, I didn’t see it creeping on.

'I didn’t realise at first and then people started to make comments when I was in my early 20s.
I think the first one I really remember was when I bumped into an old 
school friend and she said she worried about me because of my size.

'She wasn’t being mean or anything, I do think she was genuinely concerned. I was putting my life at risk and in the end I realised something had to change.

'My mum just made it so much easier for me because I found it hard to be motivated. Now I love going out with my friends and showing off my figure.

'I always used to feel like the ugly one but now I feel incredible.'

Bev, who is using the technique with 
other clients, said: 'I was worried about Danielle’s fitness- her weight
was reducing but she still wasn’t anywhere near as fit as she should 
be.

New woman: 'I always used to feel like the ugly one but now I feel incredible,' she said after being hynotised into loving exercise

'The HypnoGastricband helped her achieve her weight loss but I needed to get her motivated into exercising.

'When I did her first Hypnocise session I incorporated a short workout which we did together, then I repeated the same under hypnosis.

'But I also inputted positive subliminal, motivational suggestions to encourage her to repeat this every day and enjoy it as well.

'I put together a CD which took her through the workout under hypnosis- she then played this every day.

'I have never seen anyone change so dramatically. I added other exercises and extended the length of the session so she could endure more.

'Now she does 30 to 60 minutes every day. She is fitter and more energetic than ever and looks fantastic and I am so proud her.'
