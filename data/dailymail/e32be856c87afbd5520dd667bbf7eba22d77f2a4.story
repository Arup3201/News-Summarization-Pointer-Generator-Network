She is the first to admit her last novel Jump! was not as racy as some of her others, because it’s harder to write sex scenes now she is in her 70s.

But at 76, Jilly Cooper, queen of the bonkbuster, has no intention of putting her pen down for good.

Her writing is not just a passion, but a necessity to pay for the round-the-clock care needed by her husband Leo, who was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease more than a decade ago and is confined to his bed.

Such is her devotion to her husband of 51 years – whom she has known since she was nine years old – that the writer would rather he be looked after at home than in residential care.

Leo, 79, was rushed into hospital on 
Christmas Eve 2011 after collapsing at home, and Miss Cooper lived in a 
hospital for nine weeks.

Despite often speaking of her love for the NHS and her awe of its hard-working doctors and nurses, she has revealed that a succession of scandals have left her - and others - unsure whether to go on supporting it.

Criticism: Best-selling author Jilly Cooper has spoken out about the erosion of trust in the NHS

'I think people are terrified,' 
revealed Cooper. 'One hears such scare stories. It's a bit like children
hearing about terrible abuse in children's homes and being terrified of
being taken away from their parent and thrust into a home.

'There is a real blackening the name of our institutions going on at the moment.'

Now, she is determined to keep Leo at home in Gloucester.

‘He’s going to stay here,’ she says.

‘It’s sad because he has difficulty expressing himself and speaking clearly, so we have difficulty understanding what he means, which must be so frustrating for him, but he is so very brave.’

But her determination to care for her husband means Miss Cooper has to keep writing to pay the bills that stack up.

‘I’d had a minor stroke so I couldn’t do it on my own. I love writing anyway but I have to keep on working because I have to pay for it all.

‘Some people say, “Gosh, we have to work until we are 70”, but I feel lucky that I can.’

Tragic: Cooper, whose husband Leo has Parkinson's Disease, previously championed the health service

For Cooper, the fact that she can support her husband in light of the flailing state of the National Health Service is a good thing.

She has previously spoken warmly of the NHS after receiving exemplary care following a mild stroke she suffered three years ago but now says that accountability within the organisation is a growing issue.

'Some
of the patients are a bit muddled and when a lady comes around with a 
clipboard and asks when they last saw a nurse or a doctor they say two 
days ago, even if it was two minutes ago and that's what goes down on 
record,' she added.

'Accident and emergency are absolutely inundated and people have so much paperwork to do. It's the same with all our public services, there's so much time wasted filling in forms.'

As a result, and despite the challenges involved in looking after husband Leo, who was last seen in public at the 2005 wedding of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Cooper says she would never consider putting him onto a care home.

'Absolutely not. No. This is his home. He's going to stay here. I
love him. Everybody loves him, he's precious to us all.

'It's
sad because he has difficulty expressing himself and speaking clearly, 
so we have difficulty understanding what he means, which must be so 
frustrating for him, but he is so very brave.'

Jilly says she is still writing, which, she adds, she needs to do to pay for the coupe's medical bills and care.

Image problem: A string of recent scandals have undermined confidence in the NHS says Cooper

'I'd had a minor stroke so I couldn't do it on my own. We have a
live-in carer and extra carers coming in three times a day, who are 
marvellous.

'!t has to be paid
for but the NHS do help with things. This is a big house and all the 
care is very expensive. I love writing anyway but I have to keep on 
working because I have to pay for it all.'

She added: 'I think people feel guilty about growing old and needing everybody there to support them.

'Some
people say, "Gosh, we have to work until we are 70," but I feel lucky 
that I can. Leo's my husband and I've got to get on with it.'

She
is currently researching her latest book on flat racing and has 
admitted her last novel 'Jump' was not as racy because it's harder to 
write sex scenes in your 70s.

Jilly
says her two adopted children, Felix, a property developer, and Emily, a
make-up artist, have looked after her 'wonderfully'.

It
was Felix who noticed something was wrong when she had a minor stroke 
and insisted she saw a doctor - a decision which could have saved her 
life.

She added: 'People don't like old moaners. I'm a great believer in laugh and the world laughs with you. People enjoy talking to older people because they are the key to the past and have stories to tell.'
