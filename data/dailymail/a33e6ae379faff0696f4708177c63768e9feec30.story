Craig White died from tuberculosis after suffering crippling headaches for a week

A student has died after  contracting a rare form of tuberculosis.

Craig White, 21, suffered from intense headaches and nausea in the months leading up to his death.

The aspiring sports journalist, from Boston in Lincolnshire, initially dismissed his symptoms as side effect of the steroids he was taking for Crohn’s disease, his family said.

When his condition worsened after a meal with friends on December 5, he was admitted to Boston's Pilgrim Hospital two days later but died on December 12.

Mr White, an aspiring sports 
journalist, had tweeted friends just weeks before he died asking if 
anyone knew of a pill more effective than paracetamol, as his 'head 
feels like it's going to explode!'

The Health Protection Agency said a 
post-mortem examination this morning identified disseminated 
tuberculosis - a rare form of the disease - as the provisional cause of 
death.

Further 
investigations into Mr White's case will now be carried out by Professor
 Robert Forrest, the coroner for South Lincolnshire.

Adjourning
 the inquest, Professor Forrest said: 'There are still a lot of details 
we need to establish into the tragic death of Craig Adam White. This may
 take a few months.'

The 
HPA said it was likely he contracted TB by breathing in infected 
droplets from a sufferer several months ago as it takes a long time for 
symptoms to develop.

TB, which was rife in Britain until 
the 1950s, is an increasing and worrying problem in urban areas. Rising 
immigration has seen a surge in cases in the last 20 years.

Cases dropped from 50,000 a year in the 1950s to 5,000 in the 1980s.

Last year there were just over 9,000 cases. London has the highest rate of infection, followed by Birmingham.

Seventy
 per cent of cases occur among recent migrants to Britain from countries
 where the disease remains prevalent such as the Indian sub-continent 
and sub-Saharan Africa.

headaches for weeks preceding his death. A post-mortem examination found

It is not known whether Mr White had recently travelled abroad.

The HPA is now offering screening for the infection to his friends at the University of Lincoln.

Mr
 White was a keen supporter of Manchester City football club and had a 
fan blog. He was in his third year of his journalism degree.

After
 his death, his girlfriend Laurie Caumette, who visited him in hospital,
 tweeted: 'Can't believe I'll never see you smile again or hear the 
sound of your voice and hear you laugh. I'm going to miss you so much.'

The
 official Manchester City twitter feed said: 'All at #MCFC send our 
condolences to the friends & family of City fan & @mcfcview 
blogger @cwhiteuk who sadly passed away recently.'

In a statement issued by the HPA, Dr Katie Geary said cases of disseminated TB were rare but not unheard of in the UK.

Dr Geary said: 'Our thoughts are with the family at this sad time.

'As part of normal practice, all 
close contacts considered to be at risk of contracting the disease will 
be offered screening to see if they’ve been exposed to the infection.'

She
 added: 'Exposure to the infection through contact with someone who has 
the illness does not mean that an individual will go on to develop TB.

'Transmission occurs through coughing
 of infectious droplets and usually requires prolonged close contact 
with an infectious case.'

Disseminated
 TB develops in the small number of infected people whose immune systems
 do not successfully contain the primary infection.

Those who take immune-suppressing medications are at higher risk for disseminated TB, because of their weaker immune systems.

Disseminated
 disease can occur within weeks of the primary infection. Sometimes, it 
does not occur until years after you become infected.

Low doses of immune system suppressants are often administered for Crohn's disease.Steroids are known to suppress the immune system.

The disease mainly affects the lungs, where it can cause calcium deposits which make it difficult to breathe.

It can also travel to other parts of the body including the brain, kidneys, bones and joints.

Symptoms
 can include fever and night sweats (both sometimes experienced by 
Crohn's sufferers), an unexplained prolonged cough, unexplained weight 
loss or blood in phlegm.

However,
 many people who are infected never develop symptoms - although the 
bacteria remain in the body, they are not infectious.

Craig's girlfriend Laurie Caumette, who visited him in hospital, tweeted: 'Can't believe I'll never see you smile again or hear the sound of your voice and hear you laugh. I'm going to miss you so much.'

Tributes to Mr White were posted on Twitter, including one from Manchester City FC

It is curable with a six-month course of antibiotics, but a drug-resistant form can develop if the course is not completed. Left untreated it can prove fatal.

A University of Lincoln spokesman said: 'We now know that Craig died as a result of developing tuberculosis.

'Craig was a much-loved member of the Lincoln School of Journalism and the whole university community has been deeply saddened by his untimely death.

'There is no reason to believe there is a risk to the health of members of the university community.'

Mail Online has contacted United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust who said they would release a statement.

The inquest into Mr White's death was opened and adjourned earlier today.
