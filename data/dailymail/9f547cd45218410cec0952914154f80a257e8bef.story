David Cameron persuaded the Queen to star in the opening ceremony of the Olympics during one of his weekly audiences at Buckingham Palace, it has been revealed.

The Prime Minister raised the prospect of the monarch making a cameo appearance on behalf of the Olympic Games chief Sebastian Coe.

She immediately said yes and vowed to 'play' herself walking with James Bond star Daniel Craig, Lord Coe revealed to former Downing Street spin chief Alastair Campbell.

The Tory Peer told Mr Campbell, who has written a book on leadership in which he praises the Queen, that he assumed the best he could hope for would be for the monarch to agree to a lookalike playing her.

When the organisers first mooted the idea of a scene with the Queen and the James Bond actor Daniel Craig, they assumed the best they could hope for was her permission to use a lookalike.

But according to Lord Coe, the chairman of the organising committee for the Games, when it was put to her by the Prime Minister she said she would have a lookalike in the scene where she jumps from a helicopter – but would play herself in the Palace.

Lord Coe said: 'We were aiming very, very high. We were stunned when she agreed.'

Mr Campbell said the decision was part of the Queen's leadership qualities which have made her popular with the public.

'She signed off every element,' one of her team told Mr Campbell, he writes in the Sunday Times today.

'It was a great moment for us, because she was in her mid-eighties by then, her standing was totally secure, and what that did was show a truly global audience not just that she had a sense of humour, but that the British public had huge affection for her and recognised her unique place in their lives.'

One courtier added: 'She approaches everything with a very pragmatic view.

'It's a kind of ruthless common sense. She is very uncomfortable if you try to suggest she does something that is not authentically her, but she does understand that even institutions like the monarchy must change and adapt.'

Mr Campbell said even as a life-long republican he has 'developed a huge admiration for the Queen, not least for her skills as a leader'.

He said: 'In challenging times she has secured the monarchy for at least another generation and, given the way Prince Charles and the younger princes have developed as part of a concerted strategy by 'the Firm', probably much longer than that.'

Mr Campbell also revealed that the Queen came close to breaking her rule not to give interviews by 'doing something with Clare Balding for a horse show'.

'In the end decided the 'no interview' rule had served her well and it became a lifelong vow,' Mr Campbell writes.
