Everyone else saw a comical picture of a 25-year-old in a mini-kilt - and not much else - blowing off steam with a slightly embarrassed middle-aged team-mate. Paul McGinley saw the secret of Europe’s Ryder Cup success.

The victorious captain on Wednesday pointed to the instantly infamous snap of Rory McIlroy and 39-year-old rookie Stephen Gallacher during Sunday night’s celebrations as evidence of the bonding that underpinned the home win at Gleneagles.

McGinley, who said that half an hour spent watching highlights with his son on Monday had made him more emotional than he’d been during the week, explained: ‘To see the photograph in the newspapers on Monday with Stevie and Rory - Rory wearing the kilt - that, to me, just summarised everything we achieved, that sense of bonding.

'You could see they were so comfortable in each other’s company, there was an element of fun, and there was an element of enjoyment in terms of Stevie had a drink in his hand and Rory had his kilt on,' McGinley continued.

‘That summarised so much of what I wanted to achieve, a sense of bonding between the players that will last forever.

‘I look at my dad, he’s from a Gaelic football background in Donegal and I would go to the games with him sometimes.

‘To see him meet a guy that he might not have seen for maybe 40 years, who he used to play with - immediately that bonding is there and they are sitting down and having a chat and reminiscing about old times.

‘I would love to get my mind forward to see somebody like Stevie and Rory, in 50 years’ time, having a conversation. That photograph will live forever - and it’s something that just, for me, summarises so much about the week.

‘Stevie and Rory live different lives. Rory is in a stratosphere nobody is close to. Stevie is a local boy who has had an incredibly great year to make the team.

‘He was on a high playing The Ryder Cup and there he was with the superstar and the two of them were so comfortable in each other’s company. That’s special.’

McIlroy has insisted that he values his Ryder Cup record as highly as any individual achievement, revelling in the fact that he’s now won four Majors and three Ryder Cups quicker than anyone in history.

‘The Ryder Cup is important,’ he said. ‘In three Ryder Cups, I haven’t been beaten in the singles, which is something I’d love to keep going throughout my career.

‘I think Monty (Colin Montgomerie) was never beaten in the singles in a Ryder Cup. So that would be something to emulate. You know, at the age of 25, to have won three Ryder Cups and four Majors is something I’m proud of - eight years younger than anyone else. Tom Watson did it at 33, Gene Sarazen at 35.

‘I spoke to Paul McGinley and he’s retiring unbeaten after six Ryder Cups. I don’t think I’ll be able to emulate that - but I’d love to. I’d love to be able to help Europe win as many as possible.’ As for the snapshot sent around the world via social media, both men claim some degree of amnesia, McIlroy saying: ‘The timeline gets a bit fuzzy around midnight.’

Gallacher added: ‘First thing I knew about it was when I saw the picture!

‘If I had a body like that, I wouldn’t have a top on. Which explains why I’m wearing a jumper and a tee-shirt in the picture.’
