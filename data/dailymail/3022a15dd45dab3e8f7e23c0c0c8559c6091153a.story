'Fraser has been doing a good job for us, especially this season, when we have been without some of our more senior players in the forward pack,' Leicester rugby director Richard Cockerill told the club's official website.

'He is improving all the time, and, as a prop, he still has time on his side to continue that improvement.

'There is a very strong pool of front-rowers at the club, and I'm happy that Fraser wants to continue to be a part of that.'
