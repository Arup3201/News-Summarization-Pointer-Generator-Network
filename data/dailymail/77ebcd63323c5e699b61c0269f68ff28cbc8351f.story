Downton Abbey may still be grieving the recent loss of Lord Grantham’s beloved pet labrador Isis.

But at Highclere Castle, real-life setting for the ITV drama, the lady of the house can still turn to her loyal dogs for protection from ghosts and ghouls.

The Countess of Carnarvon relied on her own six hounds to safeguard her on Halloween night from the spirits that haunt her home, she has revealed in her blog, alongside a photograph of her canine guard of honour.

She wrote: ‘I decided to let all six dogs sleep with me in my bedroom on Halloween night since my husband, Geordie, was away.

‘The dogs were all quite thrilled as we made our way along the corridors.

‘They had no idea about my superstitious date but as I drew the curtains, they happily sprawled out.’

Hours earlier, the Countess had deeply unsettled herself by recalling stories of past ghostly goings on at Highclere.

She wrote: ‘I ended up swapping ghost stories with Pat, our decorator, who was telling me about the passage and stairs where she and her father saw a ghost (a woman) and the heavy doors that, although shut, swing open.

‘Most of the staff have a story or two. Diana, our head housekeeper, has spotted a few spooky goings on and John, our castle manager, regularly hears footsteps walking along a corridor when locking up at night.’

She added: ‘My husband is quite unaffected and pragmatic, but does inquire every so often if we need another priest or whether we are managing. He will not have six dogs upstairs.’

Downton’s millions of loyal viewers should be braced for the ITV series to take a supernatural turn if Lady Carnarvon has any influence on the show’s creator Lord Fellowes.

She wrote: ‘Julian Fellowes has not yet introduced ghosts in Downton Abbey – we have had deaths, murders, suicides and plenty of illness. Perhaps this time next year?’

The Countess admits, however, that the dogs were perhaps not the most reliable of guards.

She wrote: ‘During the night, they turned and got up, whimpering as they presumably dreamt of happy games of tag, and leaping into ponds.

‘I did not sleep particularly well and had just drifted off when Scooby-Doo (who is well named) decided to leap on top of the bed, wanting an immediate cuddle.’
