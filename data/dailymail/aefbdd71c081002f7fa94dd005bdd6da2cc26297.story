A middle school principal and his guidance counselor pal who produced sexually charged slasher pics have been put on administrative leave by their schools. 

Dr. Mark Foley, a principal at Granby Memorial Middle School in Granby, Connecticut, and Aaron Vnuk, a seventh-grade guidance counselor at Windsor's Sage Park Middle School in Windsor, Connecticut, not only produced horror movies with nude scenes, but also ran a website that included images of scantily clad women.

Among the titles produced by the duo were Mind Morgue, The Limb Collector, Demon of Castlebury, and The Bard of Blood.

Double life: The two produced multiple films, as well as running a site featuring women in lingerie and posing in sexually provocative ways

The two also made a full-nudity flick, Slicing Beauty.

That film stars Kerri Taylor who 'bares all as a kinky serial killer who loves to give her victims a satisfying but often morbid peep show.' 

Foley, 45, worked under the pseudonym Mark Daniel, while Vnuk, 39, went by Aaron Thomas Howell, according to the Daily News.

The two began making films together in 2008, meeting when Foley was vice principal at Windsor's Sage.

They formed a company that became Moongoyle Entertainment, with a website that includes the tagline, 'Fresh Blood. Hot Babes. Cool Pics.'

One shot on the site shows a woman dressed as a provocative schoolgirl.

Femme fatale: It is said that in the film, Taylor's character 'bares all as a kinky serial killer who loves to give her victims a satisfying but often morbid peep show'

The pair also released a calendar featuring Moongoyle Web hostess Violett Wolfe posing in lingerie that was 'popular with prison inmates' according to their Facebook page.

The Moongoyle site and YouTube channel have been taken down in the aftermath of this controversy.

'The administration and [Board of Education] are concerned about the judgment used to be engaged in such activities while serving as an educational leader.' Granby Superintendent Alan Addley said in a written statement.

'The investigation will begin immediately and is expected to conclude promptly.'

The Hartford Courant reports that Addley also added that there was no indication Foley had engaged in any illegal activity.

No work: Granby Middle School in Granby, Connecticut, where Foley worked

Where it all began: The two first met at Windsor's Sage Park Middle School in Windsor, Connecticut, where Vnuk is still employed

'Put in the context of a school, then it's not appropriate,' Foley said earlier this week.

'But there is no overlap there, that's the thing to keep in mind. This is not being done at school or anything.'

He also made it clear that none of his films ever used one of his, or Vnuk's, current or former students.

Vnuk has declined to comment.
