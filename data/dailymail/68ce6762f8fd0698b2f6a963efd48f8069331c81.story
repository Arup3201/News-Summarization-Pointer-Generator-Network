Starring Judi Dench and Dustin Hoffman, Esio Trot wil be shown on New Year's Day at 6.30pm on BBC1

Starring Dame Judi Dench and Dustin Hoffman, the BBC adaptation of Roald Dahl’s Esio Trot is set to be one of the festive TV highlights.

And now the meeting that inspired the story of pensioners who find love through a tortoise is revealed for the first time.

Dahl hit upon the idea when he visited the London flat of his eldest daughter Tessa in the 1970s, and watched as she chatted to neighbour Mrs Shrimpton and her pet tortoise.

In a speech given to students at Wright State University in the United States, Dahl said: ‘I stood leaning over the balcony staring at Mrs Shrimpton’s tortoise in his box. And quite automatically my mind began to wiggle around with a story about this tortoise. The only point in telling you this is to try to illustrate how the mind of a writer of fantasy works. It is eager to embrace what is absurd.’

Esio Trot – ‘tortoise’ spelled backwards – is the story of Mr Hoppy (Hoffman), who is in love with his neighbour, Mrs Silver (Dame Judi).

He realises he can win her heart if he helps her pet tortoise, Alfie, to grow bigger – only to fail and then replace it with a series of bigger tortoises.

Rachel White, of the Roald Dahl Museum, said the speech – made in 1978, 12 years before Esio Trot was published – provided a unique insight into his work processes: ‘He’d have ideas but they’d sit in the back of his mind for years.’

The museum in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, will be displaying the speech from January 13 next year. For more details go to roalddahl.com/museum.

The adaptation will be shown on BBC1 on New Year’s Day at 6.30pm.
