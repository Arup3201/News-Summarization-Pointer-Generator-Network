New York City cops believe an elderly Russian woman who was punched on the back of the head by a young thug may be the latest victim of the vicious 'Knockout Game' craze.

The random attack happened on Monday when the 72-year-old woman was walking to the Jewish community center in Canarsie, Brooklyn, at around noon.

Her attacker - a male in late teens/early 20s - didn't say anything or try to rob her, which is in keeping with other so-called ‘Knockout Game’ assaults, in which the victim has been punched once in an unprovoked attack.

This latest senseless attack is being investigated by the NYPD’s Hate Crime Task Force, reports the New York Post.

The victim was not knocked out, but was taken to a local hospital where she was treated and later released, according to police sources.

New York City police have deployed 
additional officers to city neighborhoods where at least eight attacks 
occurred in the past few weeks, including an assault on a 78-year-old 
woman.

Police are investigating the cases, 
in which victims, often Orthodox Jews, are attacked by one thug, who 
tries to deliver a “knockout” blow while other teens look on.

In Monday’s incident the victim was not Orthodox and she did not report seeing any other people in the area.

But police are seeking other witnesses and possible video evidence that it was a 'knockout game' attack.

On Friday NYPD arrested a man on charges of assault as a hate 
crime after a 24-year-old Orthodox Jewish man was punched in the face in another so-called ‘Knockout Game’ 
assault.

Amrit 
Marajh, 28, of Brooklyn, had just left a bar at around 2:45a.m. on 
Friday with three friends and was talking about boxing when the topic of
 the knockout game came up, police sources said.

His victim, Shmuel Perl, 24, has said 
that he overheard his alleged attackers daring each other to punch him 
out minutes before he was actually assaulted. Perl was stuck once, but 
wasn’t seriously injured.

Marajh was arrested on charges of assault as a hate crime and aggravated harassment as a hate crime and released after posting $750 bail. His three friends were taken into custody, but released without charge.

Marajh's lawyer has denied that the attack had anything to do with the brutal game, but New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly said there was no question that the game was the motive for the attack, reports ABC.

'He makes a statement that he was punched in the side of the face,' Kelly said. 'He also makes a statement that just prior to it they were talking about the "Knockout Game".'

Police are investigating similar recent 
incidents, including in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. At
 least two deaths have been linked to the attacks this year.

Authorities and 
psychologists say the 'Knockout Game’ assaults have been around for 
decades - or longer - and it's played mostly by impulsive teenage boys 
looking to impress their friends.
