This is the moment a  Syrian military helicopter burst into flames and plummeted to the ground during fighting in Damascus.

Rebels fighting to oust President Bashar Al-Assad claimed they had shot it down.

It followed reports by the Britain- based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights of intense fighting between  Assad’s opponents and troops backed  by helicopter gunships in the western suburb of Jobar.

The Syrian army helicopter goes into a tailspin after being hit by a rebel rocket over Damascus. It leaves a trail of smoke through the sky with fire ripping through its body

The craft explodes in a fireball and plunges towards buildings, leaving no chance of survival for the pilots inside who had been firing on the city moments earlier

The military has been fighting major 
battles in Damascus and the surrounding areas for weeks and has been 
increasingly using helicopters and fighter jets in the conflict.

It is also struggling to win control of Aleppo, Syria’s second city.

The rebels are known to have 
anti-aircraft guns, and recently claimed to have shot down one of 
Assad’s Russian-made MiG fighter jets. The Syrian government blamed that
crash on a technical malfunction.

Images of the blazing helicopter were 
uploaded on YouTube. State media in Damascus confirmed the crash but 
gave no other details.

French president Francois Hollande yesterday warned Assad that any use of chemical weapons would justify military intervention.

A thick cloud of black smoke trails through the air as the chopper has now lost all control. It is only the second time rebels have shot down an army aircraft

Rebels chanted 'God is greatest' as they watched the helicopter come crashing out of the sky after the lucky shot from one of their gunmen

‘With our partners we remain  very 
vigilant regarding preventing the use of chemical weapons, which for the
international community would be a legitimate reason for direct 
intervention,’ Mr Hollande said during an annual foreign  policy speech 
to French ambassadors.

‘What’s at stake goes beyond Syria,’ he stressed. ‘It concerns the security of the Middle East and especially Lebanon.’

His comments follow similar 
declarations from Britain and the US stating that an intervention would 
be justified if Assad’s government uses chemical weapons against his 
people.

Massacre of the innocents: The shrouded bodies of children allegedly killed by government militia lie ready for burial

Nightmare continues: It is believed at least 320 people have been killed in Daraya in the last week. These are some of the mass graves of people killed in the conflict

Horrific: Bodies lying outside a mortuary in Daraya near Damascus after a ferocious assault by the Syrian army

Mr Hollande’s warning came amid mounting evidence of a massacre by official forces in the Damascus suburb of Daraya.

At the weekend activists reported that
government forces had gone on a killing spree after they seized the 
area from rebels on Thursday. Reports of the death toll ranged from 200 
to 600.

Video footage posted on the internet showed rows of corpses – many of them men with gunshot wounds to their heads.

During mass burials on Sunday the 
bodies were sprayed with water from hoses as a substitute for the ritual
washing prescribed by Islam.

Unrepentant: Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, right, meets Iranian official Alaeddin Boroujerdi in Damascus yesterday. Assad says he will continue to do whatever it takes to seize control

Restrictions on non-state media have 
made it difficult to verify activists’ accounts, but the gruesome 
footage appeared to expose the lengths to which Assad’s authoritarian 
regime is willing to go to quell the rebellion.

Assad is reported to have told a 
senior Iranian official during a meeting on Sunday that his regime would
carry on fighting ‘whatever the price’.

The country’s conflict began last 
March, with protests demanding that Assad step down. It has since 
transformed into a civil war that activists say has claimed at least 
20,000 lives.
