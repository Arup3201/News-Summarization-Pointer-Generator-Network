There were some big calls at Twickenham, but Northampton were the deserving winners of a terrific game which leaves me thinking there are direct comparisons between Saracens and England.

Saracens, rather like England at present, have the team ethic, work-rate and commitment that every coach dreams of and are hugely competitive.

But at the elite level, they are a couple of world-class players short of being able to seal the deal. Northampton in contrast had the two ‘special’ players on view yesterday in Courtney Lawes and George North who would both command a place in any current World XV on form like that.

Dejected: Saracens players stand on the Twickenham pitch helpless after their Premiership final defeat

Disappointed: The London club were on the wrong end of a 24-20 defeat

Champions: Northampton lifting the Premiership trophy

World class: Sir Clive Woodward believes that Welsh Wizard George North is a game changer

That is two huge finals Saracens have lost in the last week on top of two big semi-finals last season.

Close, very close, but no cigar.

I am a big admirer of Mark McCall and am much encouraged by what Stuart Lancaster has achieved so far with England but, in both cases, there is another big step to take.

To win at the elite level you need to either unearth special players or take the shackles off and free those you already have. Fine player that Brad Barritt is, Saracens need a more creative ball player and much better attacking kicker at No. 12.

This is the case with England as well. To win a World Cup, England need at least four star players. Lawes is definitely one.

We saw how the Jonny Wilkinson-Matt Giteau axis ran the show for Toulon against Saracens in Cardiff last week and I am convinced a Danny Cipriani-Owen Farrell combo could do the same for England, assuming the England  forwards continue their upward path.

Farrell worries me a little in the short term, regardless of any injury concerns. He was poor yesterday by his own standards and was taught a lesson by Jonny last week.

There will be some mental scars there as well as bruises as he flies down to New Zealand. He will bounce back but its been a tough week or two.

Close, but no cigar: Saracens needed a more creative number 12 than Brad Barritt on Saturday

Meanwhile, I love the way Lawes has been going about his business this season — he is becoming a player of Martin Johnson’s stature, that’s how highly I rate him. 

He used to be a bit ragged and there were occasional flashes of ill-discipline but he has tightened that side of his game and now produces every time he goes on the field. 

Jim Mallinder and the Saints coaches have done a fine job with him and he was the player on view yesterday who will have most impressed Steve Hansen and the All Blacks down in Auckland.

Lawes will have a big role to play in the Second and Third Tests.

Last week, British rugby fans said goodbye to Jonny Wilkinson in Cardiff and yesterday it was Steve Borthwick’s turn at Twickenham. Some big names and important players are leaving the arena.

It was Steve’s great misfortune that his career coincided with a handful of the very best locks in the history of English rugby - Martin Johnson, Ben Kay, Simon Shaw and Danny Grewcock - but he still  won 57 caps and captained  his country.

Don’t underestimate his value. Borthwick’s superb line-out skills and consistency for Bath, and then Saracens, kept England’s best locks right on their toes throughout their careers. That is gold dust if you are national coach, that strength in depth drives everybody on to new heights.

Bowing out: Steve Borthwick has retired after many years at the top

When I worked with Steve he was the first forward I had encountered who really wanted to work with coaches to plot and plan line-outs in detail. His line-out knowledge is second to none in world rugby and it is strange that England have not seen this. 

A humble man in the mould of Jonny, Steve has set the tone at Saracens. Eddie Jones has pulled off an outstanding piece of business by signing Steve as Japan’s line-out coach for the World Cup. He will bring massive technical knowledge to the job.

I am fascinated by this situation developing with Worcester full-back Chris Pennell who has just broken into the England squad but will be playing with the Warriors in the Championship next season.

Pennell has forced his way into England contention after a fine season in adversity in a struggling team, but is it really possible to challenge for an England World Cup place while playing in our second-tier league? I don’t think so.

You have to ask, would Roy Hodgson pick a Championship player for a vital England game at the World Cup in Brazil this month? The answer is ‘No’ and the comparison is fair.

Call up: Worcester full-back Chris Pennell has just broken into the England squad

Pennell’s loyalty to Worcester is not in question and, of course, ideally Dean Ryan would want his star player available, but we are talking about the season heading into a home World Cup. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and there can be no compromise.

A solution needs to be found and England and the RFU need to meet Worcester halfway here.

Pennell needs to be loaned out to a Premiership club for the season and preferably one who have qualified for the European champions Cup, because he is playing catch-up and needs as much exposure to that level of rugby as possible.

In return, the RFU should help fund a top-quality overseas Test full-back replacement for Pennell at Sixways. This is a time for solutions, not questions.

The Aviva Premiership or France’s T14 — which is the best? Both flagship national leagues have enjoyed really good seasons and drive each other on, but for me the T14 just nicks it.

The dazzling array of world talent in France makes for an intoxicating mix that will eventually inspire rather than baulk young French talent.

Divide: Steffon Armitage won the European Player of the Year award whilst playing for Toulon but is excluded from playing for England

The atmosphere at some games - I was at Felix Mayol recently - is extraordinary, but what clinches it is that in France winning the T14 is still rated above winning the Heineken Cup. That adds an incredible intensity to proceedings.

Wouldn’t it be interesting to stage an annual game between the two leagues in which the overseas players would all be available. Any takers?
