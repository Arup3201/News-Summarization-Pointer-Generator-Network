Cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott has revealed how he turned to Feng Shui to help him beat cancer.

The famously blunt-speaking former England captain says he was ‘open to anything’ in his four-year fight against the killer disease after the discovery of a tumour in his neck.

He enlisted the help of Master Li, a feng shui expert used by a friend - who advised him which direction he should sleep and identifying which areas of his house were most healthy.

Cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott, who has revealed how he turned to Feng Shui to help him beat cancer 

In his new book, The Corridor of Certainty, which is being serialised by the Daily Telegraph, Mr Boycott wrote: ‘I was open to anything, just trying to find things to help me stay alive,’

The 73-year-old said that on diagnosis, he was given just three months to live unless he embarked on a gruelling programme of chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment.

He coped with the painful sessions following the 2002 diagnosis by thinking back to his cricketing days.

‘In one day cricket I used to count my runs, how many an over we needed to win and whether we were above or below the asking rate,’ he said.

‘I went about it in exactly the same way when I had treatment. I would count each and every one until we got to the halfway mark.’

Side effects from the chemotherapy included destruction of Mr Boycott’s taste buds, which took 12 months to recover, and his immune system, which only returned to normal two years later.

Describing an appointment with his consultant at which he was given the all clear, he said: ‘ Sitting there waiting for the verdict is like waiting for the umpire to put up his finger or say not out. I was lucky she never said not out.’

Mr Boycott added that his battle against cancer changed him as a person, ‘softening’ some of his edges and helping him become less angry.
