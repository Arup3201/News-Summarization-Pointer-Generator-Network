This is the moment a driver was rumbled in the carpool-lane with the 'most interesting' of passengers.

The state trooper came face-to-face with a life sized cardboard cutout of actor Jonathan Goldsmith when he pulled over the vehicle.

The debonair actor, aged in his 70s, is famed for playing 'The Most Interesting Man in the World' in the Dos Equis beer commercials.

When questioned about his two dimensional travelling companion the motorist replied: 'He's my bestfriend.'

 Motorists regularly try and cheat the lanes in a bid to beat congestion, but the traffic officers described it as one of the best scam attempts he had seen.

The driver was spotted flouting the High Occupancy Vehicle Lane (HPV) on the Interstate 5 near Tacoma in Fife, Washington.

The cardboard likeness was not confiscated by the trooper but the driver was warned not to use him again.

The driver received a $124 penalty ticket for offence.

Channeling the cardboard cutout, Washington Police tweeted: 'I don't always violate the HOV lane law ... but when I do, I get a $124 ticket.'

The amusing message was retweeted more than 850 times. 

Vehicles using HOV lanes must be carrying at least two people.

Children count as occupants but under the rules pets, infants still in the womb, inflatables and even ghosts, do not. 

Using dummies in these lanes has been a problem for police all over the country for years. 

 Previously motorist have been caught using wooden creations and even plastic skeletons as fake passengers in a bid to avoid sitting bumper-to-bumper

In the past a motorist was pulled over using this wooden creation as a fake passenger on the Long Island Expressway
