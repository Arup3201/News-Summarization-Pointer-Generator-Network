The headmistress at Kate Middleton’s old school has cancelled its annual leavers’ ball after pupils ran riot through the school grounds during an  alcohol-fuelled party, dressed in bright orange Guantanamo-style prison jumpsuits.

Emma McKendrick, headmistress at £31,000-per year all-girls boarding school Downe House, wrote to parents last week detailing the girls’ wild behaviour and ‘excesses’.

She listed the different types of alcohol the girls had drunk during the all-night binge, organised by them as part of their annual pre-exam fancy-dress prank day.

In the two-page letter, Mrs McKendrick explained: ‘Very sadly .  .  . a number of bottles of alcohol – wine, beer, cider, vodka, schnapps and other spirits – were brought into school.

‘Heavy drinking and smoking started in the early hours of the morning and behaviour degenerated. I was called at 5.30am by the Sixth Form House staff responding to the noise and the consequences of excessive drinking. I am afraid many of the girls let themselves down badly as a result of what they had consumed.’

She concluded that the girls could not be trusted, saying she had therefore decided to call off the ball, a widely respected post-exam celebration.

Situated just ten minutes from the 
Middletons’ family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, Downe House also 
counts TV presenter Clare Balding and comedienne Miranda Hart among its 
alumni.

The school prides itself on hosting one of the most extravagant and well-attended leavers’ balls in the country.

A
committee of students and teachers is tasked with organising the 
black-tie event, which is held in a different location each year, while 
girls are encouraged to invite boys from the best public schools in the 
country including Eton, Radley and Winchester.

The
school’s decision to cancel the ball came as a shock to students, who 
quickly took to Twitter and Facebook to share their anger at the news.

One girl posted: ‘Hahahaha this place is having a laugh.’

Another wrote: ‘Our leavers ball has been cancelled! I’m going to be single for the rest of my life.’

Headmistress Emma McKendrick wrote to parents detailing the girls' excesses

In her letter, emailed to parents last Wednesday, the headmistress refused to say whether the event would be reinstated next year.

Mrs McKendrick wrote: ‘We have been giving very careful consideration to the future of the leavers’ ball, an event which relies on a great deal of self-regulation as the girls have left school. After very careful thought and much discussion, we have decided that the school can no longer support the ball.

‘This means that the event will be cancelled as we cannot take the risk of any repetition of this type of behaviour which was in some instances dangerous and showed very little regard for individuals’ welfare and safety.’

Mrs McKendrick, headmistress since 1997,
also chastised the girls for sharing ‘inappropriate’ photographs of the
Guantanamo-style celebrations on their social media accounts, many 
still available for public viewing.

She
advised parents to encourage the removal of all incriminating images 
from Twitter, Facebook and photograph-sharing site Instagram 
immediately. 

‘The 
pictures, usually tagged with names, have made grim viewing and will 
probably  not be those they will wish on view in later life, 
particularly not to future employers,’ Mrs McKendrick warned.

‘I am particularly anxious that those who have posted pictures of others which are not favourable should remove them.’
