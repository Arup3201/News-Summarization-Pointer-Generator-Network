Nigel Farage is facing defeat in his bid to enter Parliament next year, a new poll has revealed

Ukip leader Nigel Farage is facing defeat in his bid to become an MP  in next year's general election, a new poll has suggested.

The survey, carried out for former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft, found that Mr Farage is trailing the Conservatives by five points in Thanet South - on 29 per cent, to 34 per cent for David Cameron's party and 26 per cent for Labour.

A similar survey in July gave him a four-point lead in the Kent constituency.

The same poll suggests Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg faces a tough fight to hold onto his Sheffield Hallam seat, with a narrow advantage of just three points over Labour.

Just 31 per cent of voters in Mr Clegg's constituency told pollsters they will back Mr Clegg in May. 

At the 2010 general election the Lib Dem lead held his seat with 53 per cent of the vote.

But the poll bolstered Mr Clegg's hopes of hanging onto a sizeable number of MPs in the 2015 election, suggesting that many sitting Liberal Democrats are 'entrenched' in their constituencies and could save their seats by outstripping the party's national performance.

Ed Miliband's 26-point general election lead in Doncaster North, meanwhile, has been squeezed to 12 points, and the poll suggested he could be vulnerable to tactical voting. 

The combined total of Ukip and Tory supporters - making up just over half the electorate in Mr Miliband's constituency - top the 40 per cent who said they will vote Labour.

In a further blow for the Labour leader just 35 per cent in his South Yorkshire constituency said they would rather have Mr Miliband than Mr Cameron as PM.

But when asked to choose their favourite PM from the four main party leaders, almost a quarter (24 per cent) of Mr Miliband's constituents plumped for him, compared to 23 per cent who picked Mr Cameron.

Mr Clegg claimed that Lib Dems will retain most of their 56 MPs in next year's election despite dismal opinion poll ratings, which have put them as low as 6 per cent nationally, and their recent lost deposit in the Rochester by-election, where they finished fifth behind the Greens.

'Ukip have got two MPs, the Greens have got one. We have got 56 and we will retain the vast, vast majority of those,' the Lib Dem leader told LBC radio.

'I really do think when people come to put the cross on the ballot paper they will say 'Who's done stuff for me and my family?'.

'On that, we are going to be very proud and we are going to stick our logo on our leaflets and say 'We did it'.'

Nick Clegg could lose his seat to the Labour party in May next year, a poll by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft has shown

The Ashcroft poll, which focused on marginal Lib Dem seats as well as party leaders' constituencies, appeared to give some backing to Mr Clegg's analysis.

Of 11 key marginals where Lib Dems are under challenge from Conservatives, the poll suggested Mr Clegg's party would hold onto nine - including Energy Secretary Ed Davey's Kingston & Surbiton, Brecon & Radnor, Carshalton & Wallington, Cheltenham, Colchester, Hazel Grove, Lewes, Southport and Thornbury & Yate - while losing North Devon and Portsmouth South, where MP Mike Hancock is sitting as an independent.

Labour was primed to win back Burnley, but would fail in its attempt to gain Birmingham Yardley from the Lib Dems, the poll suggested.
