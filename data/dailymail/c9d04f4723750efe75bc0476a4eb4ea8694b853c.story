Petra Stunt, 25, appointed Paul Fleury in 2012 to help with the £25m refurbishment of her London home

A ‘sophisticated fraudster’ who conned the daughter of Formula 1 billionaire Bernie Ecclestone out of £1.6m while renovating her £25m Chelsea mansion has been jailed for nine months.

Paul Fleury, 45, was appointed by Petra Ecclestone, 25, in February 2012 after she bought one of London’s most magnificent townhouses - Sloane House - for £70million.

The socialite, who now goes by her married name of Petra Stunt, had a budget of £25million to transform the historic building in West London, including a new wing featuring a pool, gymnasium and underground car park.

She appointed Fleury – a trusted friend who had worked for the family for the past seven years – to carry out the renovation, but he ended up defrauding her of £1.58m of the budget.

Mrs Stunt, who alongside sister Tamara, 29, is often portrayed as spending ‘Daddy’s billions, discovered last year how Fleury – who was paid £7,000 a month to manage the renovation work – was forging invoices from companies that did not exist and paying them into his own bank accounts.

Fleury claimed his payments had been verbally agreed with the heiress and said they were ‘commissions’– a claim denied by the Ecclestones.

Last month, a High Court judge ruled that Mrs Stunt was entitled to summary judgment against the fraudster and an injunction was imposed to freeze Fleury’s assets.

However, a court hearing today heard how Fleury failed to comply with the freezing order and he was jailed for nine months by Mr Justice Turner.

During the hearing, Mrs Stunt’s counsel, David Cavender QC, described Fleury as a ‘sophisticated fraudster’ and said his defence was ‘inherently incredible’ and an ‘obvious fabrication’.

Dismissing Fleury’s case as hopeless, Mr Justice Turner said his defence was ‘a convenient lie which he invented months after his wrongdoing had come to light’.

The judge agreed with lawyers for Sloane House Ltd - Mrs Stunt’s company which engaged the contractors undertaking the redevelopment - that Fleury had flouted the terms of an injunction freezing his assets and should receive an immediate prison term as punishment for his flagrant contempt of court.

Mrs Stunt bought one of London's most magnificent townhouses - Sloane House - for £70million in February 2012 and appointed Paul Fleury, 45, to oversee lavish renovations which she set aside a budget of £25m for

He said Fleury had demonstrated that he was capable of serious dishonesty to achieve substantial financial gain and, in addition, was willing not merely to push against the boundaries of legitimate interpretation of the scope of the injunction but deliberately to act in surreptitious breach despite the real threat of imprisonment.

He added that the breaches had not been limited to a misguided attempt to preserve Fleury’s mechanical installation, servicing and repair business but had also facilitated the maintenance of his ‘hedonistic lifestyle’.

After the hearing, Petra, who is married to billionaire James Stunt, said: ‘It is an extremely unpleasant experience to discover that a person who you have placed in a position of trust is deceiving you and to find that, even when discovered, they have continued to engineer ways to breach the freezing order imposed to restrain them.

‘As this matter is now in the hands of the Metropolitan Police, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.’

Robert Wynn Jones, of law firm Mishcon de Reya, said: ‘It is important that the courts impose custodial sentences in these circumstances.

‘Freezing orders are an essential part of the legal toolkit in these types of fraud cases and to have them flagrantly breached as they have been in this instance is unacceptable.

‘When you get an order freezing assets and for asset disclosure in a fraud case, you expect the defendant to comply.

‘If they don’t comply, serious consequences can follow - including imprisonment - as has occurred in this case.’
