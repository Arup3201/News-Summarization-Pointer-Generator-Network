Gone are the days of long exposures and image distortion – Canon has unveiled a new camera sensor that can capture photos and videos in very low light.

The new sensor is able to capture well-defined pictures of stars without the photographer having to take a long exposure or increase the camera’s sensitivity.

It can even be used to 'see in the dark' and take pictures of friends at night without the need for any lighting.

The sensor facilitates the shooting of clearly visible video images even in dimly lit environments with as little as 0.03 lux of illumination

The sensor is so sensitive that it even enabled the filming of shooting stars during the Geminid meteor shower.

It has also been used to capture a man’s face in a room lit only by three incense sticks.

This is possible because Canon has used new technologies in the pixels and readout circuitry which reduces noise.

Thanks to this technology, the sensor facilitates the shooting of clearly visible video images even in dimly lit environments with as little as 0.03 lux of illumination, or approximately the brightness of a crescent moon

The full-frame, 35mm-film-size, camera sensor is even more specialised than Canon’s earlier DSLRs which, themselves, are known for their low-light performance.

The CMOS sensor features pixels measuring 19 microns square in size, which is more than 7.5 times the surface area of the pixels on the CMOS sensor incorporated in Canon’s top of the range SLR cameras.

It can be used to film full-HD video but it is only able to create video footage from a 1920 x 1080 array meaning that it only has one photosite per output pixel so cannot offer the same colour resolution as Canon’s EOS C200 professional video camera.

Canon believes that the first generation of this technology will be used primarily in non-consumer applications, such as surveillance, medical research and astronomical observation.
