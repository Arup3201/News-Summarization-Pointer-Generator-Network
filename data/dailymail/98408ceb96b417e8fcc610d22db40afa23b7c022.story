The Obama administration conceded on Thursday that its vaunted Affordable Care Act enrollment numbers from last year were inflated by a whopping 400,000.

That's how many dental insurance plans were included in the final number when the White House boasted in September that 7.3 million Americans had signed up for medical insurance through government-managed marketplaces. 

The dental plans should not have been lumped into the overall total because they represented people who also had purchased medical insurance, effectively double-counting them.

Including the dental policies was a break from previous practice that Republicans suspect was a scheme to push the administration's numbers over the 7 million mark. That the number the Congressional Budget Office had projected would be needed in order to keep the program financially viable.

Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told Congress in September that 7.3 million Americans had medical insurance through Obamacare, but 400,000 of that total was quietly double-counted by including dental plans

Trouble in Washington: The Obamacare law is increasingly unpopular, according to a recent Gallup poll

Staff investigators at the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee uncovered the ruse, which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quickly called an honest mistake.

CMS spokesman Aaron Albright confirmed the White House's use of creative math on Thursday.

In May the administration had claimed more than 8 million people enrolled in Obamacare plans during the open-enrollment period that ended March 31.

That number later fell to 6.9 million after more than 1 million were dropped from the rolls – some because they never paid their premiums, and others because they couldn't prove their legal resident status.

With the 400,000 dental plans added in, the administration had the 7 million it needed for PR purposes, and to keep skeptical GOP opponents at bay.

'Faced with large numbers of Americans running for an exit from Obamacare, instead of offering the public an accurate accounting, the Administration offered numbers that obscured and downplayed the number of dropouts,' said House Oversight Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican.

'Now they’re saying this was just a "mistake." The claim that this was only [an] accident stretches credulity. The administration misreported Obamacare’s enrollment figures not once, but twice.'  

The news that the White House may have cooked Obamacare's books comes at an awkward time, after a series of videos surfaced depicting Jonathan Gruber, the law's architect, explaining how Democrats used deception to get it past Congress.

In one video he credited 'the stupidity of the American voter' for the success of a ruse that recast large tax increases as penalties on insurance companies.

Those costs are passed through to customers, rendering the result the same as if it were officially a tax.

Second time's the charm? Obamacare is open for enrollment again through March 31 

Economist Jonathan Gruber, Obamacare's main architect, was caught on video candidly discussing the level of deception the Administration needed in order to pass the law in Congress

Former Congressional Budget Office director Douglas Holtz-Eakin told Bloomberg that 'the No. 1 most effective message against the Affordable Care Act is [that] they lied to you to get it through.'

'People believe that years now after its passage. The distrust is already there, and they’re doing nothing but exacerbate it.' 

Issa, who will hand over his committee gavel to Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz in January, demanded action.

'HHS must provide a clear and detailed account of who knew about this decision and when they knew it,' he said in a statement.

'This administration still appears to be calling its Obamacare transparency plan from the Jonathan Gruber playbook: dismissing the American public’s right to know with the same deceptive arrogance that helped them pass the bill in the first place.'

On September 18, CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner told the Oversight Committee that her agency had '7.3 million Americans enrolled in the health insurance marketplace coverage.'

Five days later Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told a Brookings Institute audience that '7.3 million people signed up for marketplace plans, paid their premiums, and have access to affordable care.'

Official Obamacare numbers showed 7.3 million signups but that included 400,000 dental insurance customers who had never been counted in the total before

@highlight

Actual enrollment dropped from 8 million to 6.9 million when more than 1 million couldn't prove their legal status or failed to pay their premiums

CBO had said the administration would need 7 million customers in the first year to keep Obamacare afloat financially

With the numbers fudged, the White House had the total it needed in order to put Republicans on defense and claim victory with voters
