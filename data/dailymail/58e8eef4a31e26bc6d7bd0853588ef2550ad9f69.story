The creator of global gaming success Minecraft is being accused of 'selling out' after allegedly accepting a £1.2billion deal from Microsoft.

Marcus 'Notch' Persson, a 35-year-old high-school dropout who learned to code at the age of seven, is now set to become a billionaire from the game he created in his bedroom.

The response from the gaming industry is one of shock, as the Swede is known for promoting piracy, defending small-time developers and often mocking Microsoft and its operating systems.

Last year, Persson's company Mojang AB recorded a profit of £70million, and Minecraft has now sold 54million copies world wide.

Persson,
 the son of a nurse and a drug-addict ex-convict, is now being branded a
 'sellout' after accepting the $2bn (£1.2bn) offer from Microsoft - a 
company he has not always supported, quite the contrary.

In 2012, Markus Person criticized Windows 8 and accused Microsoft of trying to 'ruin the PC as an open platform'

He also tweeted that he would 'endorse your c***' for $2bn, and it appears that he has done just that.

In
 response to the news fans have tweeted that his 'indie values sell out 
in the face of cash', and worrying that Microsoft will 'ruin' Minecraft.

'The
 gaming world is in shock. Not because Microsoft would pay two million 
dollars for Mojang, but that Mojang is even for sale,' writes 
gamingexpert Thomas Arnroth on ComputerSweden.

'Markus Persson and his Minecraft is the symbol of the so called breakthrough of the 'indiegames'.

The one scene where he has not feared the limelight has been the battle for indie-developers against the big companies.'

Markus Persson was just seven when he started teaching himself how to code. One year later he produced his first game on the family Commodore 128.

Building blocks: Persson began coding at the age of seven and created Minecraft after dropping out of high school to become a game developer - the game has now sold 54million copies worldwide

The
 family – Markus, his parents Ritva, a nurse, and Birger, a railway 
worker, and his younger sister Anna, had recently moved from tiny Edsbyn
 in Halsingland to suburban Stockholm.

In
 a biography of Persson, he remembers struggling with friendships at the
 new school, preferring playing with the computer or building with Lego 
blocks.

Minecraft was created in 2009. At the start of the game, a player is put into a 'virtually infinite game world.'

They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves. Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape.

Players are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities. As a player progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different materials.

The game was initially made for the PC but there are now Xbox 360 and mobile versions available.

His
 parents divorced when he was 11, and his father, a former drug addict 
who had remained clean throughout his children’s lives, moved out.

Persson’s relationship with his father deteriorated as Birger began using again, and he was later jailed for burglary.

Persson's
 high school years were meant to have focused on his chosen specialty 
subject, media studies, but he spent his time programming, and 
eventually dropped out aged 16.

He
 ended up working as a game developer at King.com, leaving the company 
after 4.5years in 2009 to work on Minecraft, releasing a Classic version
 of the game in May that year.

By January 2011 the game had sold 1,000,000 copies. Just nine months later, numbers hit 3,000,000.

‘The gaming world was starved of the type of star Markus Persson became,’ Linus Larsson, co-author of Minecraft: block, pixlar och göra sig en hacka (Minecraft: blocks, pixels and making a profit), told Expressen last year.

In 2012, founder Markus Persson, who tweets under the handle @notch, openly criticised Microsoft's Windows 8 software (pictured)

Persson also separately tweeted this his price to ‘endorse c***’ was $2 billion dollars, which may explain the pricing of the deal

‘He
 has a lot of fans and is received as a superstar at gaming events, it’s
 pretty amazing. He even has 1.3million [now 1.77million] followers on 
Twitter.

‘At the same time, far from everyone knows who Markus Persson is, he can still walk anonymously on the streets of Stockholm.’

MENSA member Persson is not exactly in dire needs for cash. Last year he bought Stockholm's most expensive apartment - a £2.4million penthouse in exclusive Ostermalm.

The reasons for the sale has yet to be made official, however, ComputerSweden speculates that it could be that Persson is simply bored of Minecraft.

The soon-to-be billionaire, who officially remains single after divorcing his wife of one year in 2012, has not made any comments on the deal, instead tweeting about his Rubik's cube record (it's one minute, 45seconds).
