Perhaps if Lynsey de Paul had spent less time reminiscing openly about her lovers and more time reminding the world about her songs, she would have been fixed deeper into the consciousness of today's music-buying public.

Maybe if she had boasted about being the first female songwriter garlanded with an Ivor Novello award — she won two, actually, in the early Seventies — her name wouldn't be so surprisingly absent from Who's Who, and, sadly, unknown among the young.

When her death was announced yesterday, her friend Esther Rantzen described Lynsey de Paul as a 'renaissance woman' who could sing, compose, 'do everything'. She was also a talented artist and cartoonist — a product of Hornsey Art College in London.

Lynsey De Paul died unmarried at the age of 66 on Wednesday following a suspected brain haemorrhage

She was abused and beaten by her property-developer father and did not want other girls and women to suffer at the hands of men

But she also left something that many will consider to be far, far more valuable — a message she proclaimed loud and clear and at every possible opportunity: that women must never be taken for granted or see themselves as the 'weaker sex'.

At barely 5ft tall and as delicate as china, de Paul — who died on Wednesday of a suspected brain haemorrhage — was never an archetypal feminist role model. 

But then her upbringing, in the north London suburb of Cricklewood, clearly had a lasting effect — she was abused and beaten by her property-developer father and did not want other girls and women to suffer at the hands of men.

Perhaps it was the way her father treated her that explains why, despite having an extraordinarily glamorous string of lovers, she died unmarried at the age of 66.

Lynsey smooching Hollywood legend James Coburn in 1978 during their intense relationship

The singer dated Sean Connery for five months and he would read Robert Burns poems to her and phone her from his film set

The list included Sean Connery, Ringo Starr, Bernie Taupin (who wrote songs with Elton John), Dudley Moore, Hollywood actor James Coburn and West End producer Bill Kenwright. 

De Paul's name was also linked with Diana, Princess of Wales's last lover, Dodi Fayed. A lively, gregarious woman, Lynsey lived happily alone in a vast house in Mill Hill, north London. She moved there last year from an equally large house in nearby Hampstead — friends say it was because she didn't get on too well with the neighbours.

Her vast, 7ft bed moved with her. So did her white grand piano, on which she'd composed hit songs Sugar Me and Won't Somebody Dance With Me. She also continued her nightly habit of taking food to the bottom of her garden to feed the urban foxes.

Lynsey enjoyed her own company. And with age came an attractive line in self-deprecation — she would describe herself as being 'like a Ford Escort with a re-spray'. When she gave dinner parties, she always invited couples but never a single man for herself.

With Ringo Starr in 1975, but Lynsey later dismissed their romance as 'just a fling'

Tiny and always curvaceously slim, she was fastidiously tidy. Her 20 pairs of jeans were hung in perfect alignment in her wardrobe. So were the 20 jumpers she liked to wear. 'Everything in her house had to be exactly in its place,' a friend said yesterday. 'I've never seen a home so spotless or so orderly — hardly a house for a husband.'

Yet Lynsey certainly loved men: 'I didn't lose my virginity, I gave it away to a man much older than I was,' she liked to say. Few warm memories remained of her fling with Sean Connery some 25 years ago. She'd met him in 1989 at a party. His second wife, Micheline, was sitting next to Lynsey on a sofa but, she said, that didn't stop Connery chatting her up and asking for her phone number.

'I didn't want to have an affair with him,' said de Paul, 'and I tried to keep our relationship platonic, but he pursued me relentlessly. He wasn't my type at all because I'm not usually attracted to the macho type.

'In the end I thought, 'Why not?' I didn't know his wife, so I didn't feel I was betraying her by having an affair.'

So began a relationship that went on for five months. Scotsman Connery would read Robert Burns poems to her and phone her from his film set. Intriguingly, she claimed he told her in one call that he was only able to kiss his co-star, Michelle Pfeiffer, while thinking of Lynsey. The affair ended rather abruptly. The couple met for what Lynsey didn't know was the last time, made love, then he told her he would ring her at the weekend. She never heard from him again.

Later, Lynsey was appalled when she learned that Connery had publicly condoned hitting women; his first wife, actress Diane Cilento, revealed he had beaten her during their marriage.

Lynsey said he'd never laid a hand on her, adding: 'I wasn't aware of Sean's violent side when I was with him, but I was quite horrified when I read that he'd said it was OK to hit a woman.'

She launched a furious attack in a newspaper interview, saying that she bitterly regretted their affair and that she'd 'like to give him a smack for women in general'.

Not long afterwards, she released a new book and DVD, called Taking Control — a manual for women to defend themselves against violence. Putting her words into action, she'd spent a year learning martial arts as an example to her readers. 'I don't see men as the enemy,' she said. 'I'm like a pussycat. I would rather curl up in a man's lap and purr and be stroked.

She dated Dudley Moore and observed drily that 'he was the only man I dated whose eyes were the same height as mine'

'But if I have to, the claws come out and the hissing will start.'

The book earned praise from Lord Mackenzie, then a senior member of The Police Superintendents' Association, who said it was a 'very positive contribution to crime prevention'.

But Connery was not the only violent man de Paul bedded. Even the love of her life, James Coburn, threatened her during the four years they lived together in the late-Seventies.

Coburn was the only man she wanted to marry — at least for the first two years of their relationship. But then she realised he was becoming too possessive.

'Jim didn't understand my need to make music,' she later recalled. 'He expected me to fit into his life. I wanted to get on with my music.'

There was another possible marriage that never came to pass. For years, she wore an engagement ring given to her by Chas Chandler, bassist with The Animals.

However, her relationship with Ringo Starr was merely 'a fling'. As for diminutive Dudley Moore, she observed drily that 'he was the only man I dated whose eyes were the same height as mine'.

Despite a comprehensive personal history of star-studded relationships, there was a curious modesty about de Paul's professional success and Top 20 hits.

Far more important to her was her concern about women being safe. Taking Control was a psychological as well as a physical self-defence manual, as she blamed women for their mental attitude.

'Possibly the single most damaging belief held by women is that they are the weaker sex,' she declared. 'This alone causes many to wear a subconscious air of victimisation that is too attractive for an attacker to resist. It may sound facile, but simply by walking with confidence you can deter attackers.'

Her passion for the subject came from the beatings she took from her own father. His tempers in the family home were fierce, and Lynsey said she was hit while her mother 'stood by'.

Revealing the abuse for the first time when she was in her 50s, Lynsey said: 'I knew what it was like to be frightened. I never knew what my father was going to do — slap me, yell at me, criticise me or just ignore me.

'Once, he hit me so hard that I felt sick and dizzy for three days. In the end I had to go to a doctor, who told me I was suffering from concussion. I was 19 then, and I had to save up enough money to get out of that house, which I did.

'My father had been abused by his own father, and so the pattern continued.'

Yet her father adored her mother. 'He would send her roses every month to mark the day they first met,' Lynsey said.

She escaped her father's rages by going to art school, where she got into the music business by designing album sleeves. Her musical talent was prodigious.

She wrote songs for Shirley Bassey, Heatwave and The Real Thing. A brilliant pianist, she orchestrated and produced works by Handel and Bach. She also became a director of the Performing Rights Society, the organisation that ensures composers receive royalties for their work.

As for the era's proclivity for drugs, de Paul said she remembered 'being in a restaurant in LA where the whole table was taking coke, and I just said 'no thanks' and passed it on'. No one doubted it.

In 1977 she was runner up in the Euro-vision Song Contest, broadcast from Wembley Arena, with the song Rock Bottom.

And two years ago, when the contest was held in Azerbaijan, she was on the London jury — delighted to be a judge, and not at all bothered at no longer being a star.
