Wounded: John Wood claimed he was injured in an attempted mugging, but that was untrue

A pub landlord who became a local hero after claiming he single-handedly fought off four muggers made the whole thing up, it has emerged.

John Wood has been fined for lying to police over the amazing story, which made national headlines.

At the time of the alleged attack, he proudly showed off the stomach wound he said they had given him - but now the origins of the injury are a total mystery.

The 37-year-old told police and reporters that he had been attacked by four men outside a takeaway in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, but managed to fight them off without even dropping the chips he had bought.

But after officers started investigating the story in an attempt to prosecute the muggers, it quickly unravelled as they discovered there was no CCTV footage of the incident and concluded that the attack never took place at all.

Now Wood has been issued with an £80 fixed penalty notice for wasting police time after apparently admitting he had fabricated

After the incident earlier this month he was hospitalised with a serious stomach wound which required 18 stitches, and it is now unclear how the damage was sustained.

He denies lying to police, and told the Wisbech Standard that the only reason he accepted the fine was 'just to get this bloody matter finished'.

Dave Murphy, of Cambridgeshire Police, said today: 'This man not only wasted police time, but he also raised the fear of crime in the local community.

'I hope this serves as a lesson to anyone who thinks they can lie to the police and get away with it.'

At the time Wood said he had put martial arts training from when he was a teenager into good use to fend off his attackers.

He said: 'The men stopped me and demanded my phone and wallet. I told them that if they wanted it they'd have to come and get it.

'They
 all came at me at once, I kicked two of them in the leg. I used to do a
 little bit of aikido and I remembered to go for the knees. They fell to
 the floor and couldn't get up.

'As
 I did that another clipped me in the face. I turned around and hit him 
and he fell. I turned around again and the other one came at me with 
what I thought was a knife.

'He
 just lunged and I felt a sharp twang in my side. I grabbed his hands so
 he couldn't bring it out and stab again. I pulled it out myself, 
disarmed him and then hit him. I think he was knocked out.

'Then I just got in my car and left, I didn't even drop the chips.'

Wood,
 who owns the Marshland Arms in Marshland St James, then supposedly 
drove back to fiancée Claire Upton's house with their food.

When his wound wouldn't stop bleeding,
 Wood went to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn several hours 
later where he needed 15 internal and three external stitches.

Doctors said at the time that his injuries looked like they had been inflicted with a sharpened screwdriver.

Wood said: 'The screwdriver deflected off my ribs apparently, it was a millimetre away from going into my lung. If it had gone through that it would have hit my liver, I was very lucky.

'If it had been a couple of inches over it could have been me lying in the alleyway. I dread to think what would have happened if it was somebody else in that situation.

'My fiancée was going to go for the fish and chips but I said it was too dangerous. I would never have forgiven myself if I had let her go and she'd been attacked.'
