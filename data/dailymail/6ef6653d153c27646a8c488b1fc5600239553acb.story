Syria has received the first shipment of Russian missiles that are part of a more sophisticated air defense system, President Bashar Assad bragged today.

Bashar Assad's comment on the arrival of the long-range S-300 air defense missiles in Syria could further ratchet up tensions in the region and undermine efforts to hold U.N.-sponsored talks with Syria's warring sides.

Israel's defense chief Moshe Yaalon said earlier this week that Russia's plan to supply Syria with the weapons was a threat and that Israel was prepared to use force to stop the delivery.

'Syria has received the first shipment of Russian anti-aircraft S-300 
rockets,' Al-Manar  TV quoted Assad as saying.

The Syrian leader added: 'All 
our agreements with Russia will be implemented and parts of them have 
already been implemented.'

The shipment of the missiles, if confirmed, comes just days after the 
European Union lifted an arms embargo on Syria, paving the way for 
individual countries of the 27-member bloc to send weapons to rebels 
fighting to topple Assad's regime.

The developments raise fears of an arms race - not just between Assad's 
forces and the opposition fighters battling to topple his regime, but 
also in the wider Middle East.

Israel has carried out several airstrikes in Syria in recent months that
are believed to have destroyed weapon shipments bound for Hezbollah, 
the Lebanese Shiite group that along with Iran and Russia is a staunch 
Assad ally.

With the Russian missiles in Syria's possession, the Israeli air force's
ability to strike inside the Arab country could be limited since the 
S-300s would allow it to counter 
airstrikes.

The S-300s have a range of up to 125 miles and the 
capability to track and strike multiple targets simultaneously.

Syria 
already possesses Russian-made air defenses, and Israel is believed to 
have used long-distance bombs fired from Israeli or Lebanese airspace.

When Israeli warplanes struck near the capital of Damascus, targeting 
purported Iranian missiles intended for Hezbollah earlier this month, 
Syria did not respond.

But on Wednesday, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem told 
Lebanon's Al-Mayadeen TV that Damascus 'will retaliate immediately' if 
Israel strikes Syrian soil again.

It was the regime's most serious warning to Israel since the beginning 
of the conflict in March 2011 but it was not clear if there was a link 
between al-Moallem's remark and the Russian shipment.

Israel has long lobbied Moscow over the planned sale of S-300 
air-defense missiles to Syria. However, on Tuesday, Russia's deputy 
foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said his government remained committed
to the deal.

Monday's decision by the EU to lift the arms embargo opened the 
possibility for individual countries to send weapons to Assad's 
outgunned opponents, though there was no indication any single European 
country would send lethal weapons to the rebels anytime soon.

Britain and France, the main military powers in the EU, had pushed for 
the lifting of the embargo, arguing that Europe's threat of arming the 
rebels would force Assad to negotiate in good faith.

Russia harshly criticized Europe's decision, saying it undercuts 
international efforts to bring the opposing sides in Syrian conflict 
together for a peace conference.

Meanwhile government troops were mopping up in
northern and western parts of Qusair.

The Syrian army on Wednesday took control of nearby Dabaa air base, 
dealing a major blow to the rebels in Qusair, an overwhelmingly Sunni 
town in western part of the country that has been controlled by the 
opposition since early last year.

The government launched an offensive on Qusair on May 19 and Hezbollah 
militants joined the battle, drawing the Lebanese Shiite group deep into
the civil war next door.

More than 70,000 people have been killed in the 26-month Syrian 
conflict that has had increasingly sectarian overtones.

Members of 
Syria's Sunni Muslim majority dominate the rebel ranks and Assad's 
regime is mostly made up of Alawites, an offshoot sect of Shiite Islam.

Both sides in the conflict value Qusair, which lies along a land 
corridor linking two Assad's strongholds, the capital of Damascus and an
area along the Mediterranean coast that is the Alawite heartland.

Also Thursday, the opposition coalition said more than 1,000 wounded in 
the government offensive in Qusair need to be evacuated for medical 
treatment.

The opposition said the town hospitals lack doctors and medical supplies to treat those injured and trapped there.
