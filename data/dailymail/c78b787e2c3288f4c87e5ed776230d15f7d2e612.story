So, here we are again. You may recognise it well, for it is just as we were last week. Another moment of respite, another blanket over the flames engulfing Old Trafford. Once more, the green shoots of recovery spring up and the lonely occasion creates a world of possibilities in the mind of David Moyes.

It was all there again for the Manchester United manager on Saturday lunchtime. As insipid and anaemic as his side were against Liverpool and Manchester City, so they were incisive and cavalier here against Aston Villa.

As the precocious teen Adnan Januzaj decorated this United victory with a glorious assist for Javier Hernandez late on, it almost felt an illusion that the talk of this past week had been that Moyes could be approaching the end game as Bayern Munich arrive at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening.

Certainly, this was far more like it from United. Juan Mata scored his first goal in a red jersey, Shinji Kagawa finally provided some indication as to what all the fuss is about and Wayne Rooney was immense yet again, looking every inch the United captain-in-waiting.

At this moment in time, Wayne Rooney is Manchester United. United without Rooney would be like Gladiator without Russell Crowe. Rooney has rediscovered his love for the game, charging around, all muscle and deftness. At times, it seems he is on a personal mission to keep his manager on-board.

Unfortunately, though, it is not on the basis of games at home to Aston Villa that David Moyes will be judged. Handsome victories over the lesser lights are taken as red in these parts, par for the course, one to tick off the list in the pursuit of grander occasions.

At the very least, this was an afternoon of relief for David Moyes. This result stills some of the squalls around him and provided a timely riposte to the crass aeroplane stunt that undermined the vast majority of Manchester United supporters who have, for the most part, been generous in their backing of Moyes this season.

Time, however, is devoured extraordinarily quickly in football these days and with the words 'Wrong One - Moyes Out' emblazoned in red letters across the Old Trafford skyline, this became a day of some significance for the United manager.

There have been times this season when it has seemed as though United have turned so many corners that they have gone full circle and Saturday marked another of those 'Is this the day it all changes?' junctures for the imperilled United manager.

The problem for Manchester United under David Moyes is that their hot streaks last only until the next challenging fixture. The month of March has offered a fitting snapshot of United's curious season. A 3-0 win at West Bromwich Albion was followed by a 3-0 defeat at home to Liverpool.

Optimism was garnered by victories over Olympiacos and West Ham but the air swiftly went out of the balloon with the midweek capitulation against Manchester City.

Saturday yielded another of these rosier days but the next dose of reality is expected when Bayern Munich arrive at Old Trafford and there is little reason to expect that this fluctuating script will deviate any time soon.

Following United under David Moyes has become a life of extremes and too often the air of renewal has proved deceptive. The David Moyes 'Hokey-Cokey' is starting to become a weekly occurrence in these parts. In, out, they shake him all about. For now, the rank-and-file have settled down and while the Stretford Enders wonder privately - and my, how they do - there was no voluble mutiny on this occasion. Winning helps, of course.

From plane spotting to plain-sailing, this was a day of appeasement but these United supporters have seen enough false starts this season to be taken in by a victory over Aston Villa. In truth, Paul Lambert's side, just like Olympiacos ten days earlier, were generous opponents for a side teetering on the brink.

Moyes will be only too aware that radical improvement is required if United are to challenge Bayern Munich in the Champions League. United's record in the defining matches this season has been appalling. In 13 matches against sides in the top nine of the Barclays Premier League, United have won just one.

Tough test: German champions Bayern Munich are United's next opponents on Tuesday

Moyesâ€™ warning to Pep Guardiola's all-conquering team that â€˜Old Trafford is not an easy place to comeâ€™ is rather undermined by a home record that is equal to Norwich City and only one point better off than those of Hull City and Crystal Palace.

The statistics are jaw-dropping. United have failed to win nine of their sixteen Premier League assignments at Old Trafford. Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool, Everton and Newcastle United have all kept clean sheets at Old Trafford and four of those teams won without reply.

A cursory glance at the teams United have beaten in the Premier League this season only hastens the conclusion that United are little more than flat-track bullies: Swansea City, Crystal Palace, Sunderland, Stoke City, Fulham, Arsenal, Aston Villa, West Ham, Hull City, Norwich City, Cardiff City and West Bromwich Albion.

Struggles: Moyes looked dejected as his side crashed to a 3-0 defeat at home to City on Tuesday

This United squad may be packed with serial winners but their manager appears to suffer from a conviction deficit disorder in the biggest games. The major holes in his CV are yet to be patched up.

It is now 49 Premier League away games as the opposing manager at Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United that Moyes has failed to win a football match.

There has been an apathy in these season-defining matches that goes against all we expect from a Manchester United team. Not only has the swagger disappeared but so too has that obstinacy, that refusal to wither, that rejection of defeat. United have fallen behind on sixteen occasions this season and only four times have they recovered to win.

Against Bayern, United must recover their old identity, stop playing chess and as the ditty goes, excite the fans with 'football taught by Matt Busby'. Moyes' side must shed their inhibitions and display the kind of character and nerve that is considered mandatory by those who come through the turnstiles.

Moyes talks wistfully of the plans he is busy formulating for the long-term at Old Trafford but he will know deep down that football is also about the here and now, the next 90 minutes.

There may be a masterplan in place behind-the-scenes but for the time being, the supporters require one of those magical nights at Old Trafford to escape the despondency and to reconnect, however briefly, with the fluency and majesty of the Ferguson years. Tuesday against Bayern Munich would be a fine time to shine.

All very well beating Aston Villa but a Manchester United can never be judged on a victory over a mid-table side
