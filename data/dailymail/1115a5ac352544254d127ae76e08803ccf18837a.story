Neighbours surrounding Mark Zuckerberg's $10million home in San Francisco say construction work is causing constant disruptions, taking up parking spaces and causing huge amounts of noise.

The six-bedroom luxury house in Dolores Park is one of four properties the billionaire Facebook founder has reportedly bought in the area near his Silicon Valley office.

Building work on the 1920s property the 30-year-old purchased with his wife Priscilla Chan has been going on for nearly 17 months - sparking a series of complaints from nearby residents.

Construction work on Mark Zuckerberg's $10million, six-bedroom home in Delores Heights, San Francisco has been going on for 17 months - prompting fury from residents 

According to work permits, Zuckerberg is having an office, media room, half bathroom, wine room, mud room, laundry room and wet bar added to the luxury home. 

Neighbours, who did not want to be named, told CBS San Francisco, that there was constant noise and traffic around the house. 

They described being woken up by around 50 construction workers using jackhammers first thing on a Saturday morning. 

They also claimed that he had hired people to sit in parked cars overnight so they could reserve the spaces. These did not include the four or five spaces that had been set aside for construction. 

Trafton Bean, who approached those who had been waiting in the cars, said that the scheme was't 'exactly kosher'

He told the station: 'It's ear-splitting construction. Just lots of cutting into concrete.' 

The CEO's personal fortune soared a staggering $3.8 billion in July. 

According to the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index, it made him the 4nd richest man in the world with a net worth of $16.8 billion

When Facebook floated on the Nasdaq in May last year it was one of the largest initial public offerings in history, netting co-creator Zuckerberg more than a billion dollars. 

The extensive work includes the addition of an office, media room, half bathroom, wine room, mud room, laundry room and wet bar - which is said to be costing more than $2million 

Residents in the area have claimed that Zuckerberg is hiring people to sit in parked cars and reserve spots over night - even though he already has four or five designated for construction lorries 

People living nearby have also claimed they are being constantly woken up early in the morning by construction workers using tools such as jackhammers 

The Facebook CEO - who is worth $16.8billion - is said to have bought the house with his now-wife Priscilla Chan and will share it when the work is finished
