Scotland would be more vulnerable to a catastrophic terrorist attack if Alex Salmond succeeds with his bid to break up Britain, a new report from the Ministry of Defence will claim this week. 

Britain’s top defence officials have produced a damning 86-page assessment of the impact that separation would have on Scotland’s security, which warns of the terrifying threat to the everyday lives of Scots.  

The devastating dossier will show that the tiny defence budget proposed by the SNP could heighten the risk of a terror attack which could close down the water, gas or electricity supplies to every home and business in the country.

It is expected to say that a separate Scotland may also be unable to protect itself from a ‘cyber attack’ which could see criminals or rogue states raid the bank accounts of hard-working people across the country.  

And it will also warn that the country would face a defence jobs Armageddon, including the shutdown of Scotland’s shipyards and the mass withdrawal of private firms in the defence sector, leading to the loss of tens of thousands of vital jobs.  

The report will attempt to highlight the risks to a separate Scotland by showing the huge efforts already carried out to protect Scotland as part of the UK, including defence against the threat from foreign nations and terrorists and from attacks on the country’s everyday infrastructure, such as water and electricity supplies and phone and computer connections.  

Debate: Speaking exclusively to the Scottish Mail on Sunday, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond claimed the SNP's plans are a 'dagger poised at the heart of Scotland's industrial infrastructure'

Speaking exclusively to the Scottish Mail on Sunday ahead of publication of the report on Tuesday, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond evoked the language of the battlefield by claiming that the SNP’s plans are a ‘dagger poised at the heart of Scotland’s industrial infrastructure’.

He revealed that UK networks are under constant attack, with 400,000 attacks on the government’s internal systems in the last year alone.

He said: ‘Everything that I’ve seen says to me that the Scottish Government isn’t really interested in defence. What it has said on defence looks like it has been made up on the back of a fag packet. 

‘Those who are promoting the case for Scottish independence owe the Scottish people a proper explanation of how they would be kept safe as they go about their daily business, how their families would be kept safe and how their jobs would be protected, because the defence industry is going to be decimated by what the Scottish Government is proposing.

‘The report will show the challenge of providing security for Scottish people; security in the sense of defence but also about securing the everyday infrastructure they use in their daily lives, making sure the water supply and utilities are safe from attack, that computer networks used in the workplace are not compromised and their details vulnerable.

‘It is about the impact on Scottish industry and the Scottish industrial base and the impact on jobs and employment- and the impact on prosperity and ordinary domestic security for people across Scotland.’

The report will warn that 9000 direct jobs would be at risk at the Coulport and Faslane naval bases by the end of the decade as a result of the SNP’s intention to remove Trident from Scotland if it secures a yes vote in next year’s referendum.

It will also suggest that Scotland’s shipyards could lose all of their vital orders from the MOD, because it does not hand contracts to foreign countries, which could lead to the decimation of the vital shipbuilding industry. 

And it will say that independence could result in the mass withdrawal of private defence firms from Scotland, as they will not want to be at risk of losing MOD work. 

That could prove to be disastrous for the 16,000 defence jobs based in Scotland.  

No major defence firms have publicly stated their concerns about separation, but they have raised their concerns privately.

Mr Hammond said he has urged company bosses to speak up on the risks and expects some to do so in the next year.  

It is a real dagger poised at the heart of Scotland's industrial infrastructure

‘We have been making the case to the defence industry that they need to speak up,’ he said.  ‘I hope that as we move through next year towards the referendum they will at least be frank with their own workforces about these issues. 

‘It is thousands and thousands of jobs across Scotland at risk.  It is the shipbuilding industry, it is the hi-tech industrial base – people like Selex – it is the 9000 direct jobs in Coulport and Faslane by the end of the decade that are at risk because of the Scottish Government’s threat to Faslane.

'Then of course there are the thousands and thousands of jobs in the supply chain.  

‘It is a real dagger poised at the heart of Scotland’s industrial infrastructure.’  

Last week, the Mail on Sunday revealed that Mr Hammond is building a new offensive ‘cyber strike force’ costing up to £500 million to stave off the threat of attacks on Britain’s systems.

The spending is in addition to hundreds of millions of pounds spent every year on defensive systems. 

Mr Hammond said building the whole cyber defensive system from scratch in an independent Scotland would need ‘huge fixed cost investment’.

He said: ‘There are significant economies of scale and it is clear that the UK is able to deliver a level of cyber protection for all the people of the United Kingdom as they go about their business and daily lives in a way that an independent Scotland would find very difficult to do, especially within the budgets that have been set out already.

Cyber force: Mr Hammond poses in the top-secret bunker beneath the Ministry of Defence, from where the cyber wars of the future will be fought to starve off the threat of attacks on Britain's systems

‘We have to be able to defend that IT infrastructure against attacks, whether from state actors, terrorists, criminal hackers, and that will become increasingly important in the future.  The financial system is a regular target of cyber attackers.’

The new MOD report will be the fifth in a series of ‘Scotland Analysis’ papers produced by the UK Government to assess the implications of independence.  

It is will cover all areas of defence in the UK and highlight the economic and employment benefits of the industry to Scotland, as well as the damage that independence could do. 

It will also show how Scottish members of the armed forces can enjoy ‘varied and interesting’ careers in one of the world’s most highly-regarded forces – and warn that they might not want to leave the UK’s forces for a smaller standalone Scottish Army. 

Significantly, it will also highlight that existing units based in Scotland are part of the UK Armed Forces – meaning a separate Scotland could not simply ‘co-opt’ them.  

The report will say: ‘Personnel might very well not wish to leave the UK Armed Forces to join much smaller forces, not least because of strong bonds of loyalty.  

‘From a defence perspective, the transition to independence would therefore be extremely complex, raising serious questions over how an operational capability for an independent Scottish state could be managed.’
