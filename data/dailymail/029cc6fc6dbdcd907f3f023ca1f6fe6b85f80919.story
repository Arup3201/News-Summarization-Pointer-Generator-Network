Virgil van Dijk’s Dutch agent has fired the starting gun on a New Year auction for the Celtic defender.

Sunderland, Everton, West Brom, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur are amongst the clubs interested in the £10million Parkhead star.

And, speaking to a Dutch magazine, Henk Martin Chin predicted a hectic window of activity after claiming interest in his client is intensifying.

‘Virgil has a good relationship with the (Celtic) manager,’ he said. ‘He will continue giving everything for Celtic. But if beautiful clubs in the Premier League or other big leagues make concrete offers, you do not say no immediately.

‘Is there anything currently? There is a lot of interest. It could be a busy winter.’

Celtic boss Ronny Deila has repeatedly urged the Dutch defender, under contract until 2017, to wait for a top level Premier League club in England.

As Sportsmail reported, Sunderland are keenest on van Dijk and are willing to pay £8m to sign him next month, although Chin insists his client is in no rush to leave.

‘The situation of Virgil is pretty clear,’ Chin told Voetbal International. ‘He’ s happy in Scotland.

‘At Celtic, he plays for the championship, he is active in the Europa League and features in the orange (Dutch) squad. But the fact remains that he is ambitious.’

Van Dijk’s former club FC Groningen are entitled to a slice of any transfer fee Celtic receive.
