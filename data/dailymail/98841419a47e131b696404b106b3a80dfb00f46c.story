Max Whitlock produced an immaculate performance to win Commonwealth gold and then declared he was in hot pursuit of the man considered by many to be the greatest gymnast of all time.

The high bar creaked as Whitlock flew round it like a rotator blade, before sticking his landing without so much as a stray toenail. It was the final faultless act in an almost perfect round of competition which saw him run away with the all-around title, beating his British team-mates Daniel Keatings and Nile Wilson into silver and bronze medal positions, respectively.

Whitlock, who won the team title on Tuesday, could conceivably take seven medals home from Glasgow, with five individual finals to come over the next two days, and he is a genuine gold-medal prospect in three of them.

The 21-year-old, one of the seven athletes whom Sportsmail and the National Lottery are following on the road to Rio, registered a total score of 90.631 in a performance which a deeply impressed Beth Tweddle lauded as ‘absolutely world class’.

But Whitlock will not rest on his laurels and said he had set his sights on challenging Japan’s reigning Olympic and six-time world champion, Kohei Uchimura.

‘I have been trying to push towards him,’ said Whitlock. ‘It’s an honour to be in the same sentence as that guy. He’s been my absolute idol my whole gymnastics career.’

For many years, gymnastics has been transmitted to the wider British public by Tweddle and Louis Smith, both of whom were at Glasgow’s SSE Hydro Arena to cheer on Whitlock. But Tweddle claimed Whitlock has replaced the pair as the new face of gymnastics in Britain.

‘I think he already has (taken over the mantle),’ she said. ‘After London 2012 he was a double bronze medallist and I don’t think he truly realised what he had achieved. Since then he has been building on that success and he is definitely a star.

‘He was totally world class today,’ added Tweddle. ‘He had all the pressure on him leading into these championships. It was his to lose, there is no doubt about that. It was always going to be who would come second and third, as long as Max had a nice day in the gym.’

With a drawstring plastic bag containing his chalk slung over his shoulder, Whitlock walked between apparatus with all the nonchalance of a schoolchild heading to PE class. 

On the vault, where he was trying out a more testing routine, he took a half stumble on landing, a minor blemish on an otherwise sublime day. But the gold medal was effectively sealed with Whitlock two points clear before he had even moved on to the high bar, the final test of power, poise and nerve.

By the time his Games finishes on Friday, Whitlock will have endured five straight days of intense competition. 

‘I’m really tired,’ he admitted. ‘It’s really hard actually but you know, you need to make sure you get the right food, the right rest and keep that adrenaline going. And wait until the end to celebrate.’

They call it the Friendly Games and the camaraderie between the home nation gymnasts was clear. Whitlock was embraced by a beaming Keatings when his winning score flashed on to the big screen. 

His England team-mate Nile Wilson, 18, who took bronze with a score of 87.965, was also on hand to offer his congratulations. Wilson, in his first senior competition, nailed the parallel bars and looks likely to follow Whitlock as a star of the all-around in the future.

‘He is unbelievable,’ said Tweddle. ‘In May he picked up five gold medals in the junior ranks and it is a big step to go to seniors but he has taken it in his stride. To have three from the home nations on the podium truly puts British gymnastics on the world stage.’
