The best of British come face-to-face on Saturday afternoon when Charlie Austin's QPR take on Harry Kane's Tottenham at Loftus Road.

And Austin, who has scored the most goals of any English player in the Premier League this season, is keen to put his past behind him to be viewed as a footballer and not an ex-builder.

The 25-year-old came up through the ranks in lower league football, before getting his break in the big time. To fund himself while playing for clubs like Kintbury Rangers and Hungerford Town, Austin was a builder by trade, but now the time has come for a change in mentality.

'I have scored 100-odd career goals now,' Austin told The Sun, 'and think I have done enough to be considered a player rather than a builder who plays football. I know where I have come from but I feel like I have done enough to be known as a footballer now.

'The only blisters I have on my hands these days are from the gym. Laying bricks was about five or six years ago now.'

His journey to this point is the antithesis of Kane's, who has spent 11 years in the relative comfort of Tottenham Hotspur's academy.

For Austin though, that route didn't work out. He was released by Reading as a teenager for being too small, and had to rely on opportunities elsewhere to get where he is today.

'Coming through the academies didn't work for me,' the QPR striker continues. 'I was released at 14. I wouldn't change it at all. Harry [Kane] would probably tell you the same about his upbringing. We just got taught differently.

'My way you pick up things as you go through the game. For players in academies... everything is in place for them at the clubs.'

Regardless of their differences, Austin and Kane will face each other for the first time on Saturday afternoon. In fact, they've never even met before.

29 league goals between them this season has warranted calls for international call-ups, but all eyes will be on west London to see which player comes out on top in this encounter.
