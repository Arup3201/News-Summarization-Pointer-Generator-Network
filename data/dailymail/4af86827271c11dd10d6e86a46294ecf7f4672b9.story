QPR have told Loic Remy to make a quick decision on his future following the collapse of his move to Liverpool.

The French frontman's dream switch to Anfield fell through on Sunday due to concerns over the 27-year-old's fitness.

Uncertain future: QPR striker Loic Remy

Remy is due to report back to training with the Hoops at the weekend and Redknapp has urged the former Marseille forward to commit himself to the west Londoners.

'We need to know whether he’s going to stay or not, because we can’t be losing him on transfer deadline day or something and then not have a striker,' said the Loftus road chief.

'If he’s going to stay we need that commitment now and we need to get him going, get him fit and get him playing.'

Time off: Remy was given an extended break after the World Cup
