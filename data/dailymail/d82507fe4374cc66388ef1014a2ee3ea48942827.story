Minecraft founder Markus Persson has sold his hugely popular game to Microsoft.

The announcement was made on Microsoft's official Xbox blog, and reports claim the software giant paid $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion) for Persson's company Mojang, which includes rights to the game.

And, once the deal is finalised, Persson has announced he will leave the company.

Minecraft founder Markus Persson has sold his hugely-popular game (pictured) to Microsoft. Reports claim the deal is worth $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion). Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, made the announcement on Microsoft's official blog

'Today is an
 incredibly exciting day for our team as Mojang and the Minecraft 
franchise join Microsoft,' explained Phil Spencer, head of Xbox.

'Our relationship with Mojang began when we initially talked to the team about bringing Minecraft to the console.

'Minecraft
 quickly became the top online game on Xbox Live, with over two billion 
hours played on Xbox 360 in the last two years.

'That working relationship set the ground work for other opportunities. We’ve long seen the incredible potential of Minecraft.'

'We’re
 excited to welcome Mojang to the Microsoft family and we are thrilled 
to support the success and longevity of Minecraft for years to come.'

Mr
 Spencer added that Minecon - the annual Minecraft convention - will 
continue next year, and the firm will have 'much more to share in the 
coming months.'

The
 deal exceeds the amount Facebook paid 
for virtual reality headset firm which creates Oculus Rift.

In a statement released following the acquisition, Persson said: 'I'm leaving Mojang. 

'A relatively long time ago, I decided to step down from Minecraft development.

'Jens [Bergensten] was the perfect person to take over leading it, and I wanted to try to do new things.

'I was at home with a bad cold a couple of weeks ago when the internet exploded with hate against me over some kind of EULA situation that I had nothing to do with. I was confused. I didn’t understand. I tweeted this in frustration.

'I’m not an entrepreneur. I’m not a CEO. I’m a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter.

'As soon as this deal is finalised, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments.

'Considering the public image of me already is a bit skewed, I don’t expect to get away from negative comments by doing this, but at least now I won’t feel a responsibility to read them.

'I’m aware this goes against a lot of what I’ve said in public. I have no good response to that.

'I love you. All of you. Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I can’t be responsible for something this big.

'In one sense, it belongs to Microsoft now. In a much bigger sense, it’s belonged to all of you for a long time, and that will never change.

'It’s not about the money. It’s about my sanity.'

Following the news, Twitter user @aaronmblevin wrote: 'If Minecraft can teach us anything today, it's that the interests of capital always come before the interests of the collective.' 

'Today is an incredibly exciting day for our team as Mojang and the Minecraft franchise join Microsoft,' explained Phil Spencer, head of Xbox. 'We're excited to welcome Mojang to the Microsoft family and we are thrilled to support the success and longevity of Minecraft for years to come' (game still pictured)

While @karl_haynes tweeted: 'Now Minecraft is going to get more and more expensive, while working less and less.'

Persson created Minecraft in 2009 before releasing it widely in November 2011.

At the start of the game, a player is put into a 'virtually infinite game world.'

Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of 
the landscape.

Players are 
given blocks and tools to build towns and cities.

The game was initially made for the PC but there are now Xbox 360 and mobile versions available.

progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different

The game was initially made for the PC but there are now Xbox 360 and mobile versions available.

In 2012, Persson criticised Windows 8 and 
Microsoft for trying to 'ruin the PC as an open platform', he also 
separately said his price to ‘endorse cr*p’ was $2 billion dollars, 
which may explain the pricing of the deal.

More than 16,645,000 people have bought the game, so far, and it is an online phenomenon.

There are even YouTube channels dedicated to showing people how to play the game, which in same cases make the owners enough money in advertising to quit their jobs.

Aside from the revenue that Mojang will generate for Microsoft, experts believe the firm will use it to push existing services on new customers.

Piers Harding-Rolls, director, Head of Games at  IHS Technology told MailOnline: 'Microsoft's move to buy Minecraft developer and owner Mojang may come as a surprise to the game's more fervent fans, but it is rooted in commercial, if not cultural, sense.

In 2012, founder Markus Persson, who tweets under the handle @notch, openly criticised Microsoft's Windows 8 software (pictured). He also said 'Got an email from Microsoft, wanting to help 'certify' Minecraft for Windows 8. I told them to stop trying to ruin the PC as an open platform'

'The news 
robustly dismisses the idea that games are no longer at the core of 
Microsoft's strategic direction and also underlines the growing 
importance of independent titles alongside big-budget games.

'Minecraft is arguably the best-positioned independently-owned IP across the games sector today.

'While
 it has already generated over 54 million games sales and revenues 
approaching $500m, Minecraft is a franchise built to last, making the 
likely heavy investment required to secure Mojang significantly less 
risky than many other recent acquisitions within the games or app 
sectors.'

Microsoft bought Nokia's phone business for $7.3 billion in April and is also seeking to boost Microsoft's Windows Phone system, which has gained little traction against Apple's iPhones and Google's Android system.

Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella has made mobile phones and Internet services priorities for the company as its traditional businesses - Windows and Office software installed on desktops - slow down or decline.

'We believe the acquisition of the ubiquitous Minecraft game strategically makes sense as Microsoft looks for ways to drive users toward its nascent mobile hardware business, where it can leverage and cross-sell a wide range of its higher-margin software, such as Office 365 and Windows,' FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives added.

Professor of Practice Mark Skilton told MailOnline: 'This move is a reflection of the 'platforming' strategy that Satya Nadella and others recognise as critical to building a strong customer base.

'Microsoft started Xbox as a separate 
area but this move for Mojang demonstrates it's still very much a core 
platform for user traffic generation.

'The
 online gaming industry is fast moving from niche collective enthusiast 
to mass market and Minecraft is a logical move as big business follows 
the traffic numbers in the digital world.

'Minecraft
 made more than $100 million last year and has over 100 million 
registered users with 14.3 million copies of the software game on the 
PC.

'It is another case of a blockbuster software investment to drive the gaming platform industry.'

Since last 
November, Minecraft has become one of publishing's most successful 
franchises with a series of compact, illustrated books, too.

This
 includes three guides - Minecraft: Essential Handbook, Minecraft: 
Redstone Handbook and Minecraft: Construction Handbook - that have 
already sold more than 6 million copies combined, according to publisher
 Scholastic.

In October, Ordnance Survey released 
Minecraft Britain, a 3D gaming map that lets users them explore the 
whole of the UK and build new settlements in their virtual back gardens.

Minecraft
 Britain was built using Ordnance Survey maps of the UK as a base and 
was constructed using 22 billion building blocks from the game.

It
 covers the equivalent of 86,000 square miles of mainland Great Britain 
and the surrounding islands and each block represents 50 square metres.
