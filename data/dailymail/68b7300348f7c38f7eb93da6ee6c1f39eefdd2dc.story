The Duke Cambridge was blessed with good luck this weekend after he submitted his head to the jaws of a Chinese-style lion on his tour of Japan.

Prince William was visiting a coastal area in the north of the country that was one of the areas worst hit by the 2011 tsunami.

The town of Onagawa was severely damaged on March 11 four years ago, when a huge 28ft wave swept across the land after it was triggered by an earthquake.

The royal arrived in the neighbouring city of Ishinomaki this morning and spent some time at a local newspaper, which produced handwritten copies when the electricity went down after the disaster struck. 

Hiroyuki Takeuchi, who was editor of the paper of the time, has since established a children's newspaper, allowing younger members of the community to tell their own stories about the disaster, as well as reporting on everyday events.

He then headed to a hilltop in Ishinomaki that overlooks an area nicknamed 'The Bay Of Destruction', in reference to how much of the land was laid to waste after the wave. 

William paid his respects and presented a bouquet of flowers at a shrine for the 3,300 residents of the area who lost their lives in the tragedy.

Thousands more were injured locally in the disaster and 20,000 also lost their homes in the incident. 

The last stop in his four-day tour of Japan was of particular importance to William - he had insisted that he visit areas hit by the tsunami on his first ever trip to the country.  

While the people of the country have been working hard to rebuild their lives after the disaster, much of the worst-hit areas are still badly affected.

During his visit to the town of Onagawa in the afternoon, William visited a market called the Chime Of Hope that has been completely rebuilt after it was demolished in 2011. 

The second-in-line to the throne met with shopkeepers and residents from the new neighbourhood shopping centre, which has re-established 30 businesses from a tailor's shop, to a greengrocer, cafe and an artist's design studio.

Hundreds of locals turned out to greet the 32 year old, with many waving Union Jack flags.  

At the end of the visit, William rang the Bell of Hope, which originally hung in in Onagawa Station and was washed away during the tsunamii, but was later found in the harbour. 

Thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the second-in-line to the British throne
