Ian Holloway was biting his tongue in a manful effort not to say anything controversial. But in the end, a moment of silence spoke louder than words.

'Did Watford play very well? Honestly, yes they did,' he began. 'Did they defend well? Yep, we made them. Did we attack quite well? Yep. Did we play quite well? Yep.

'Did the ref have a good game?' It was at this point Holloway tailed off.

Ian Holloway was disappointed with several of referee Bobby Madley's decisions during his side's defeat

The Millwall manager had spent the previous 10 minutes treading very carefully, openly admitting that any overt criticism of referee Bobby Madley would result in his bank account being debited. Payee: The FA.

Dancing around the controversial issues in front of the microphones has become an essential skill for any manager and Holloway produced a masterclass worthy of Strictly.

The contingent of nearly 2,000 Millwall fans sang '3-1 to the referee' as Madley whistled the end of a contest that saw Watford return to the top of the Championship. Holloway let their annoyance flow through him.

'Football fans are usually quite accurate, aren't they?' he said.

He was aggrieved that his bustling forward Ricardo Fuller had been denied a penalty when Joel Ekstrand challenged him in the box, moments before Watford scored at the other end with a contentious free-kick.

Millwall captain Alan Dunne had collided with Troy Deeney on the edge of the box and the decision could really have gone either way. Dunne was booked and Daniel Tozser smashed home the resulting set-piece.

'I thought my team came and played very well and how we've lost by two goals, I really don't know,' Holloway said.

'If I say what I feel, I'll probably get fined. I really don't want to pay because a referee has not done his job. I don't want to pay for my opinion on it.'

Five minutes later, he concluded with: 'Have I said that the referee is bad in his role? No' and exited stage left. Well, he'd said just about everything but.

Madley's performance aside, it would be harsh to say Watford were undeserving of victory. Their classy performances on the field this season have made light of their managerial merry-go-round.

Huddersfield Town continued their rise up the Championship table with an eye-catching 3-0 home win over Nottingham Forest. 

Joel Lynch needed just 43 seconds to score against his former club, before Nahki Wells and Grant Holt struck to condemn the early pace-setters to a ninth game without a win. 

Forest manager Stuart Pearce said: ‘Collectively, we’re a little too easy to play against.’ 

Watching Deeney, Matej Vydra and the other buzzing Hornets is to wonder whether quick-fire changes in command are a good thing.

Czech Vydra was exceptional once again. After scoring 22 times in 47 matches during his first loan spell from Udinese in 2012-2013, he has seven already this time round and must surely make permanent his move to England.

Watford resembled the Italian club in a replica of their black-and-white strip from 1914 as Vicarage Road remembered the fallen with a spectacular 'red poppy' display in the stands and the playing of the Last Post on the pitch.

And Vydra's first-half strike — a deft flick from a Keith Andrews ball — to cancel out Martyn Woolford's opener will stick in the memory, too.

Gianni Munari made sure of victory in the second half and the midfielder on loan from Parma echoed his manager Slavisa Jokanovic in saying there was more to come.

'We can get better. There are a lot of games still to play, but if we fight like today we will have a successful season,' he said.

Former Chelsea player Jokanovic has an air of permanence after a turbulent start to the season that saw Beppe Sannino fall out with the board, Oscar Garcia quit for health reasons and Billy McKinlay sacked after just eight days at the helm.

One of six teams who could have ended the afternoon in top spot, Watford seized their opportunity and even Holloway was deferential.

'Try and keep your head on it and keep going,' he advised. 'Good luck to you.'

 WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE..

Cardiff's revival under Russell Slade continued with a 3-1 win over Leeds, their third victory in four games under the new manager.

Shrewsbury's Andy Mangan, who scored against Chelsea in midweek, was at it again with a stunning volley in their 2-1 win at Dagenham.

Spare a thought for the Carlisle fans who made the 696-mile round trip to Portsmouth only to see their side behind after just 80 seconds. Pompey won 3-0.

Russell Slade has done sterling work with Cardiff as the Welsh club's revival continued with a 3-1 over Leeds
