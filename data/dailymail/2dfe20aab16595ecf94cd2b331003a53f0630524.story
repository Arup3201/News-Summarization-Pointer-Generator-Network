A shopper was left horrified after he opened up a pot of Marks & Spencer soup and found a latex glove floating inside.

Rob Eaglesham, 38, was looking forward to his lunch of 'Super Bean Lentil and Barley' broth.

But as the NHS worker sat down to eat the M&S meal he was shocked to find a blue rubber glove on the top of the soup.

Spoilt broth: NHS worker Rob Eaglesham, 38, found a blue glove in the pot of M&S soup he bought in Leeds

Bosses at M&S said they have launched an investigation into the incident last week and have asked for the soup to be returned.

Mr Eaglesham, of Chapel Allerton, Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: 'I opened this particular pot and a blue rubber glove was on top. I was pretty grossed out. I still haven't touched it.

'I'm surprised. A company of that reputation, you wouldn't expect it. It was pretty stomach churning to find something like that.'

In a video he posted on YouTube, Mr Eaglesham added: 'This isn't just any lentil and barley soup, this is M&S lentil and barley soup, and it contains... a blue glove from the factory floor.'

He said he complained to M&S and they
 have since offered him a full refund on the soup he bought at a branch 
in Leeds city centre.

An M&S spokesman said: 'We're sorry to hear about our customer's complaint.

'Quality is extremely important to us, so we've asked the customer to send us the soup as soon as possible, so we can investigate further.'

A spokeswoman added that M&S is still waiting for Mr Eaglesham, who first contacted customer services at the weekend, to send in the pot.
