A college freshman has died as a result of bacterial meningitis.

Sara Stelzer, an 18-year-old who was attending San Diego State University, was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday with flu-like symptoms and passed away on Thursday.

The teen had previously been vaccinated for meningitis, meaning this is likely a different strain.

Eerie remark: The teen complained of sick students on her Twitter just two weeks ago

Now, the university is looking to test 300 to 400 people who may have had contact with the young woman, who appears to have spent her weekend doing pledge activities at her new sorority, Kappa Delta.

'This coming weekend might possibly be the best weekend of my life,' she wrote on Twitter early last week. 

She attended two fraternity parties over the weekend it seems, one at Alpha Epsilon Pion October 8 and one on Octeber 9 at Delta Sigma Phi house.

Now, the school is trying to put students at ease.

'This bacteria, it's not easily transmitted, particularly through the air,'said Dr. Gregg Lichtenstein, director of SDSU Student Health Services and director of clinical services.

'This is what we call a droplet infection, so that means people have to have close contact with respiratory secretions.'

According to ABC 10, campus wide emails were sent to let students know about the situation, what symptoms to watch for and where to get help.

It is believed that Stelzer may have exposed others through close contact from October 5-14.

Remembering Sara: 'It doesn't feel real to lose such a vibrant, beautiful person this fast.' one friend wrote of Stelzer's passing

Oddly, on September 29, the teen complained about the number of sick students on campus on her Twitter, writing, 'I would be shocked to meet a freshman at state who doesn't at least have a cold.'

The time between exposure to the disease and the onset of symptoms can be between two and 10 days. 

Great friend: The freshmen spent the weekend with her sorority sisters and at two frat parties

Stelzer had graduated from high school in Moorpark, California earlier this year, and began her studies at San Diego State University in late August.

'It doesn't feel real to lose such a vibrant, beautiful person this fast. You always managed to brighten everyone's day,' wrote her friend Emily Claudy on Twitter.
