Two builders were stunned to discover this battered wallet 35 years after it was lost with its contents perfectly preserved.

Richard Thompson, 26, and Tony Noi, 34, found the purse tucked inside a brick wall cavity while refurbishing a leisure centre in St Ives, Cambridgeshire.

Inside they found a gym membership card which expired on March 31, 1978, a driving licence for a Mr Richard Lane and a trade union membership.

Lost: The brown leather wallet belonging to a Mr Richard Lane which was found after 35 years inside a wall cavity in St Ives, Cambridgeshire. The original owner has not been located

Lost in time: A membership card for the leisure centre belonging to a 'Mr R M Lane' which expired in March 1978 that was found in the wallet

Discovered: The out of date member card says on the back of it 'if found, returned (sic) to reception'

The wallet appears to have been lost in the wall in early 1978.

They also found a payment plan for a new television, with a final installment of £1 still due.

Despite an extensive search the builders have not been able to trace the original owner.

Find: Builder David Tweed, 45, with the wallet at the spot where workmen found it while working on a £4million redevelopment of the leisure centre

Building site: The Leisure centre in St Ives where the wallet was found as it undergoes a £4million redevelopment

Wallet: A paper driving licence belonging to Richard Lane which was found inside the wallet. Despite being in the wall for 35 years, it is still valid and contains details of a £20 fine for an offence committed on August 8, 1975

Purchases: An invoice for items bought in Dixons in July 1977 for a total of £22.22

Invoice: A series of cash payments made for goods in 1976 and 1977. The payments stop in September 1977, which is presumably around the time the wallet was lost

Find: Documents discovered inside the wallet which was hidden within the cavity wall

Payment received: Another one of the documents found. Despite the builders' best efforts, they have been unable to trace the owner of the wallet

Mr Noi said: 'They are altering the roof up there and we were just up doing some wiring.

'A brick was taken out to thread some wire through and then we saw the wallet stuffed in there.

'I was surprised to find it in the wall to be honest, I don't know why somebody would put it down there.

'There was no money in it for anything, just a gym membership and a driving licence that expired before I was even born.

'There was a payment plan in there as well for a TV and I think the last payment was just a quid. That was probably a lot of money in those days though.'

Mr Thompson said: 'We hope that the owner can be reunited with their wallet as it contains personal belongings.'

A spokesman for Huntingdonshire District Council, which runs the leisure centre, said that they were unable to find Mr Lane on their system.

Lost: A library card for Huntingdon and Peterborough which was hidden inside the wallet

Paperwork: A trade union membership card belonging to Mr Lane for the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades

Union: Membership of the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades which is no longer in existence

Discovery: The leisure centre where the missing wallet was discovered 35 years after the owner must have lost it
