Nur Nadir is seeking £5million in a divorce settlement as well as property and a car

She vowed to stand by Asil Nadir when the fugitive fraudster was jailed for ten years.

But now the tycoon’s wife Nur, who is 42 years his junior, is said to be demanding a £5million divorce.

Only 15 months after pledging to help Nadir fight to clear his name, she is reported to have begged her husband to let her go.

As well as the £5million, she is seeking his four-wheel-drive vehicle and villa in Northern Cyprus.

Nadir, 71, who received millions in legal aid from the taxpayer during his Old Bailey trial after nearly two decades on the run, is said to have told her from his prison cell: ‘If you leave me I will reject everything and leave my fight for life.’

Mrs Nadir, 29, is understood to have had a bitter falling out with her husband’s family, which has seen her use Twitter to attack ‘slander and ugly behaviour’.

She supported Nadir throughout his trial. The tycoon, who had agreed to return to Britain after fleeing to Northern Cyprus, was found guilty in August 2012 of stealing almost £29million from his Polly Peck empire in the 1980s.

Mrs Nadir returned to Cyprus afterwards but was fired from her position at The Cyprus Media Group by its boss, Nadir’s sister Bilge Nevzat, a local newspaper reported. According to another paper, she claims to have been pressured into the divorce by Mrs Nevzat.

It reported tweets from Mrs Nadir saying: ‘When I first returned to Cyprus, I had dinner with my mother-in-law and sister-in-law.

‘Bilge Nevzat asked me: “I guess you will divorce my brother now. You won’t ruin your life with him now will you?” And I said of course I won’t divorce him and that I will do anything I can for him to get over this and then I left.’ 

She added: ‘I wanted to remove myself 
from all of what was happening … I wanted to rid myself of all these 
events and I begged to my husband to let me go, I told him that I didn’t
 have the strength any more. He said: “If you leave me I will reject everything and leave my fight for life.

'I couldn’t handle his sad voice, nor could I handle this responsibility.’

Mrs Nadir’s lawyer has reportedly said the divorce will go through if she lowers her demands and accepts £2.5million.

A friend of Nadir said last night that the tycoon’s family did not get on well with Nur, his second wife, and was not surprised they were divorcing.

The friend added: ‘When someone as young as her marries someone as old as her grandfather, one draws one’s own conclusions, especially given the reports she’s asking for £5million.’

The friend said Nadir was coping well with life in Belmarsh prison, South-East London, adding: ‘He’s a strong character. He’s actually doing a good job in there counselling other prisoners.’

The Serious Fraud Office investigation and trial cost an estimated £23million. Despite claiming millions in legal aid, Nadir and his wife lived in luxury throughout the case, staying in a £23,000-a-month Mayfair mansion and being chauffeur-driven by minders.

Mrs Nadir, who is reported to be back in Britain while the divorce is finalised, could not be contacted for comment.

Mrs Nevzat could not be contacted either.
