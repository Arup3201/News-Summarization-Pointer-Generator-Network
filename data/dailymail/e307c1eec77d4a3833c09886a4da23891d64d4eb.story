Thespians are well-known for their diva-ish demands, but when the actress in question has four legs and a tail, directors expect them to get along with their co-stars.

Not so Lizzie the corgi, seen here for the first time, who has been sacked from smash West End show The Audience after refusing to work with the Oscar-winning star, Dame Helen Mirren.

The doggy diva was replaced by theatre bosses just days before opening night at London's Gielgud Theatre because she would not obey Dame Helen, who portrays the Queen as she meets various prime ministers over her 61-year reign.

In a scene set at Balmoral with former PM Harold Wilson, the 67-year-old actress, who also portrayed the Monarch in the 2006 film The Queen, has to lead a dog onto the stage.

The corgi, a breed beloved by our monarch, is then led off stage left, but at the end of the scene she was meant to run back across the stage when called by Dame Helen.

Unfortunately, Lizzie ignored her commands and eventually producers, tired of her obstinacy, instead appointed understudy Katie to take her place.

Stephen Daldry, the director, said Lizzy was spot on for the first three shows but began misbehaving soon after. He told The Sunday Telegraph: 'She was excited the first three times, and then I think she decided she didn't want to be an actress anymore.

'She decided to retire from the British stage. Now she's at home, a resting actress, resting by the fire.'

Dave Jordan, of Animal Actors, the agency that provides the thespian hounds, said homesickness was behind Lizzie's sudden change of heart.

He said: 'She was in the wings and and the exit was there and she decided it was her time to go home.

'Once it's in a dog's head it's difficult to stop it. It is slightly diva-ish behaviour.

'The understudy is doing OK, touch wood, but we've got another one just in case.'

Lizzie has been used numerous times by Queen look-a-likes keen on an extra touch of authenticity.Â  She lives at home with her owner Mrs Davey, who has five other corgis.

The use of the corgis in the play has resonated with audiences, who often sigh with delight when the animals come on.

Mr Daldry, who directed Oscar-nominated films Billy Elliot and The Hours, added: 'People seem to think corgis nip and yap, but all the ones we work with - including dear old Lizzy - have been gorgeous.

Producers, unfazed by Lizzie's behaviour, are planning to add a scene with a live pony. It is being put in by the play's writer Peter Morgan, who also wrote the screenplay for The Queen.
