The letters were all written in German by author Ian Fleming, pictured, and were for his Austrian lover Edith Morpurgo, the daughter of Salzburg businessman Abraham Morpurgo

James Bond creator Ian Fleming told his Austrian lover he'd like to hurt her then tame her 'like a wild animal' in series of love letters, it was revealed today.

The letters, written in German by Mr Fleming, were for his lover Edith Morpurgo, the daughter of Salzburg businessman Abraham Morpurgo.

Written in the early 1930s, he tells his temptress: ‘I'd like to sleep with you just once and do nothing to you, just wrap my arms around you and hold you tight and find you there when I wake up.’

In another missive, sent from 11 Throgmorton Avenue, where he was working for banker Cull & Co, Mr Fleming writes: ‘I will say nothing more to you – only that I ---- you.

‘If I were to say “love” you would only argue, and then I would have to whip you and you would cry and I don't want that. I only want for you to be happy. But I would also like to hurt you because you have earned it and in order to tame you like a little wild animal. So be careful, you.’

The letters are part of a collection, said to be worth up to £47,500, which will be auctioned off at the New York antiquarian book fair next week by booksellers Peter Harrington.

As well as the passionate but heartfelt notes, the collection also features two illustrations for Miss Morpurgo – one of which describes where on her body he would like to kiss her.

Inscribed with ‘Wo ich Dich küssen will’ (where I want to kiss you), the image is of a pair of eyes and a pair of feet with kisses dotted in between.

The second illustration, called ‘Ich will mit Dir’ (I want to ... with you) shows a door with a Do Not Disturb sign on it and two pairs of shoes on each side.

The collection also includes a photograph of Mr Fleming sat in Austrian mountain scenery wearing climbing boots and shorts. The image is captioned: ‘Der Vater von James Bond 007, ein Freund 1934 in Osterr[eich]’ which translates to ‘The father of James Bond 007, a friend in 1934 in Austrian’.

While the letters are not all dated, those which are place Mr Fleming and Miss Morpurgo’s relationship in 1934 and 1935, when Fleming would have been in his twenties.

It is thought he spent time in Austria before studying at Geneva Unviersity and working at Reuters. In 1933, he moved to London and joined banking firm Cull & Co.

Miss Morpurgo, who was born in 1912, four years after the author, went on to marry Julius Jakob David Essinger in 1939 and had a daughter with him. The couple and their child died in Auschwitz in 1942.

London-based booksellers Peter Harrington describes the collection as a ‘fine correspondence revealing the typically tempestuous relationship, with hints of sadomasochism, between the young Fleming and Edith Morpurgo (1912–1942)’.

Some of the letters highlight the passion between the pair, with one reading: ‘I only want to kiss you and say nothing. It makes no sense, but I send you the pieces – of my HEART!!!!’

Another says: ‘I will protect you and perhaps understand you better and you will become calmer.

'You’ll really need little money, beloved, and I beg you not to worry about it … I kiss you and I am happily YOUR Ian.’

One of the letters, which was ripped up by the recipient before being taped back together, also reveals a different side to their relationship.

It reads: ‘You know that I don’t like your friends because I am a little jealous of them and don’t like the fact that you look forward to being with them. I know I cannot keep you in a cage like a bird.’

Ian Fleming also sent his lover a picture of himself in front of an Austrian mountain and captioned it: 'Der Vater von James Bond 007, ein Freund 1934 in Osterr[eich]' which translates to 'The father of James Bond 007, a friend in 1934 in Austrian'

London-based booksellers Peter Harrington describes the collection of letters as a 'fine correspondence revealing the typically tempestuous relationship, with hints of sadomasochism, between the young Fleming and Edith Morpurgo (1912 - 1942)'

Senior specialist Adam Douglas said the letters show ‘romantic flirting’ but a ‘rather sadistic side to Fleming as well’.

He told The Guardian: ‘They were written so early in his career that he was of course not famous … so the chances of somebody keeping this kind of material are quite low.

‘They're by an author well before he became an author, playing around with the things he would turn to gold.’

He also added that it gave the public more of an insight into what the James Bond writer was like and added how ‘rather amazing’ the likeness between the author and his famous fictional character were.

English author Ian Fleming, pictured, had twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections published - two of which were published posthumously following his death in 1964

Mr Fleming, who was born in London into a wealthy family connected to the merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co, started writing his first James Bond novel, Casino Royale, on 17 February 1952.

It was completed within two months and published in the UK in April the following year.

In total, he had twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections published - two of which were published posthumously following his death in 1964.
