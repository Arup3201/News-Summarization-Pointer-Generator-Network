Not only is the 'Container Guest House' funky and futuristic to look at and a novelty for friends of the owner to stay in - it was built with a sustainable strategy.

The lodge in San Antonio, Texas, was built by award-winning design firm Poteet Architects.

The firm were tasked with the project by an artist who lives in a small warehouse on a formal industrial site and wanted to experiment with shipping containers.

They installed sliding doors, windows, heating, air conditioning and an 8 foot by 4 
foot bathroom to make it the perfect place for visitors to crash for the night.

The 'Container Guest House' was created for an artist in San Antonio, Texas, who wanted to experiment with architects

The artist who owns the container lives in a warehouse on a former industrial site in downtown San Antonio

Modern: It features an open plan sitting room as well as a bathroom with compost shower

Both the floors and walls are lined with bamboo plywood

The compost toilet is used for the garden outside, while the red walls are covered with sheet metal

The finished product also features many innovative and environmentally-friendly qualities, starting with the 'upcycle' of the container itself.

Built into the roof is a garden that provides air-flow to reduce the amount of heat retained by the container.

The garden is watered by an irrigation system that uses grey water from the sink and shower.

The bathroom is a composting toilet.

The interior is insulated with spray foam then lined with bamboo plywood, equally appropriate for the floor as the walls.

The rooftop garden helps stop the container from retaining heat from the sun

The emphasis was on sustainable strategies-- first, the recycling of a container for a new and permanent use

The finished project serves as a guest house and is fitted with a shower/WC and a custom stainless sink

The exterior light fixtures are blades from a tractor disc plowÂ¿a common sight in south Texas

Outside, the deck is made up of HVAC equipment pads made of recycled soda bottles that have been set in a steel frame.

The rear of the container is screened by wire mesh panels which will eventually be covered in evergreen vines.

The Container Guest House won a 2010 Design Award from AIA San Antonio.
