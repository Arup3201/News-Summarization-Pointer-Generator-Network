For those debating between which seasonal ski pass to purchase, experience level and location are two major factors to consider. 

Scout Ski's infographic is a detailed breakdown that helps winter tourists make an informed choice when it comes to deciding between popular season pass contenders: the Vail Resorts' Epic Pass and Liftopia's Mountain Collective pass.

But, as it turns out, a traveller's best option hinges on whether they're a weekend or destination skier.

For those who love to travel and enjoy winter sports with a bit of international flavour, the $749 (£478) Epic Pass may just be worth the investment - even if you ski just 10 days in three different Vail resorts.

This pass is valid not only at Vail's American ski hills, but also at their Japanese, Swiss and French resorts.

For those sticking close to home and heading to slopes only on weekends, Mountain Collective's $389 (£248) option is likely a much better bet. 

But they will have to be satisfied with keeping to North American soil though, since Mountain Collective does not offer any European or Asian ski destinations. 

For beginners, the Mountain Collective option may be best, while five per cent more of the hills on the Epic Pass are targeted for the advanced contingent.

Scout has also outlined the optimal ski road trip route - for each pass - to help skiers hit as many American resorts as possible. 

There is also a handy reference guide when it comes to picking family-friendly hills, local restaurants and the best apres-ski watering holes.
