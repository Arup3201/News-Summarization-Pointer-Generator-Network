Hatem Ben Arfa has arranged to meet Newcastle United fans on the same day the club holds an 'open day' as his first-team exile continues.

The French midfielder has invited supporters to join him at The Back Page book shop just around the corner from St James’ Park. 

The 27-year-old will not be part of the open training session and has responded by setting up the opportunity for the Toon Army to talk with him at 6pm on Tuesday.

Waving goodbye? Newcastle winger Hatem Ben Arfa will meet supporters on Tuesday after falling out with manager Alan Pardew

Not wanted: Ben Arfa, pictured here in training last season, could leave St James' Park this summer

Manager Alan Pardew has criticised Ben Arfa’s professionalism and banished him to the reserves during pre-season.

Sportsmail understands there is little chance of a reconciliation and Newcastle would prefer Ben Arfa to find a new club.

The former Marseille man has one year remaining on his contract and United would like to bring in a fee for the playmaker.

However, there is every chance Ben Arfa could head out on loan for the duration of this season before leaving on a free next summer.
