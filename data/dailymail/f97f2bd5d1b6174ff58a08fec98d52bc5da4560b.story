Celebrity chef Rick Stein pioneered its revival, Gordon Ramsay is planning on opening his own and Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge said his 'last meal on earth' would be cod and chips from his local takeaway.

The humble British chippy is enjoying a revival as endorsement by celebrity chefs and upmarket restaurants make fish and chips fashionable again. 

And the number of chippies in the UK had risen to 10,500 by last year, outnumbering both McDonald's (1,200), and KFC (840).

More than 2,000 new chippies have opened in the last decade, according to the National Federation of Fish Friers (NFFF).

Andrew Crook, treasurer of NFFF, said: 'It's great to see such high profile people talking about fish and chips and it demonstrates how far the industry has come.

'We are seeing a change in the demographic of fish and chip shop owners as younger people are coming into the trade, all bringing new ideas.'

The industry has seen a major shift away from greasy corner-shops to well-organised, clean and professional establishments.

Rick Stein was an early adopter of the trend, opening a busy fish and chip bar in Padstow, Cornwall

Posh versions of the dish in gastro-pubs and restaurants has added to the affect, along with the current trend for simple and natural food.

Rick Stein was an early adopter, opening a busy fish and chip bar in Padstow, Cornwall, along with a number of fish-inspired restaurants and shops in the town. 

Gordon Ramsay is getting in on the trend, with plans for a fish and chip restaurant in Las Vegas Nevada, named 'Gordon Ramsay's Fish & Chips' in spring 2015.

And in an interview with the Mail on Sunday Masterchef star Tom Kerridge - who runs the two-Michelin starred Hand and Flowers in Marlow, Buckinghamshire -  said his last meal would be fish and chips from his boyhood chippy, Danny Dykes of Linden, Gloucestershire, washed down with a can of Lilt.

Erini Panayi, co-manager of Danny Dykes Fish & Chip Shop, said: 'It was great to be given that recognition from Tom because we've worked hard for 23 years, we've been constantly on the go.

'It's a really filling food and it's not that expensive. Where else can you get a meal for £3.84?

'Often people come from abroad and they can't wait to try fish and chips. It's a traditional English meal.

'It's also healthy - we have customers who have lived up to 100-years-old coming in every day.'  

Britain currently spends £1.2bn on fish and chips, which equates to 382 million portions or six servings for every man, woman and child every year.

Mr Crook, of the NAFF, added: 'Fish and chips are so engrained in the hearts of the British public.

'And with so many celebrity chefs keen to serve our iconic dish, fish and chips are here to stay.'

The popularity of fish and chips peaked in Britain in the 1920s, when there were around 30,000 fish and chip shops in the UK.

But this had dipped to just 8,600 by 2003 amid concerns over the high fat content and other fast food outlets grew in popularity.

However, the number of chippies had risen to 10,500 by last year, outnumbering both McDonald's, with 1,200, and KFC, with 840.
