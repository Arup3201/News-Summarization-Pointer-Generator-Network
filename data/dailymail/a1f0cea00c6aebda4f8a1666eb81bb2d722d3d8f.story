The haka is an emotive and spine-tingling performance on the rugby field when the New Zealand rugby team face-off against their opposition.

But in this incredible video, those feelings are ramped up yet further as soldiers of 2/1 RNZIR Battalion perform their Unit Haka, powerfully acknowledging the lives and feats of their fallen comrades as they come onto the Unit's parade ground.  

It is also an emotive farewell for they will leave via the waharoa (the carved entrance way) for the very last time.

Used as an indicator of emotion, the haka is a perfect way to remember and salute fallen soldiers

As the family of a fallen soldier walk behind a hearse, the soldiers move forwards to greet the entourage before the Maori tradition begins.

The performance is mind-blowing, each soldier seems like they know their role in the formation, whether it be barking the orders from the front, or circling the car from the side. 

The video was shot in 2012, but has recently emerged and shows the importance of the haka in the military.

The Haka is used throughout New Zealand by many, not only Maori, to demonstrate their collective thoughts. 

There is a haka for each of the Services, as well as the Defence Force. Units with the NZ Army have their own haka. 

Haka, sometimes termed a posture dance, could also be described as a chant with actions. There are various forms of haka; some with weapons some without, some have set actions others may be 'free style.' 

The entire group perform in fantastic unison as they recite the Maori-borne celebration

Haka is used by Maori (indigenous people of New Zealand) for a myriad of reasons; to challenge or express defiance or contempt, to demonstrate approval or appreciation, to encourage or to discourage, to acknowledge feats and achievements, to welcome, to farewell, as an expression of pride, happiness or sorrow. 

There is almost no inappropriate occasion for haka; it is an outward display of inner thoughts and emotions. Within the context of an occasion it is abundantly clear which emotion is being expressed.
