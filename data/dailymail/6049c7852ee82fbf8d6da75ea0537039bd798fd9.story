One would-be Romeo's unusual attempt to woo a woman he met in Starbucks has spectacularly backfired after his selfie video has gone viral.

In an apparent attempt to secure a date, the man  - dubbed 'StarbucksDrakeHands guy' online - sent the 'seductive' video to the woman.

But the 16-second clip, in which he gazes into the camera, did not have the effect he intended.

The short selfie video begins with 'StarbucksDrakeHands guy' staring intently into the camera

He then breaks into a broad smile as Drake's Hold On, We're Going Home plays in the background

It has sparked dozens of ruthless imitations after being posted online.

The woman, who has remained anonymous, reluctantly gave the man her number after he asked her at a Los Angeles Starbucks.

However, she got more than she bargained for when he sent her the bizarre video.

Set to the song Hold On, We're Going Home, by Drake, the man stares intently at the camera pulling his best model pose.

He zooms in and out of his face before breaking into a wide smile. 

The man, who has not been identified, pulls out his signature move of covering his face with his hand

The selfie video has now been seen more than 69,000 times on YouTube after being posted online

He then pulled out his 'signature' move when he coyly covered his face with his hand, while ensuring he was never out of shot.

The video went viral after the object of his affections shared it with some friends.

One of them then posted it onto his Instagram page.

The original has been seen more than 70,500 times since it was uploaded onto YouTube three days ago.

It has also prompted dozens of ruthless imitations.

Dozens of people have posted their own parodies of the StarbucksDrakehands guy video

This man takes his parody to a new level by stroking his face with three hands

This man mocks the 'Starbucks guy' by peeking through his fingers in his own parody

The hilarious parodies include one man who looks confused when his face is stroked with three hands.

In another imitation a 'suave' looking man dressed in a pink shirt rocks back and forth into the camera and, in another, a man begins to stroke his face before turning it into a scratch.

Even Toy Story's cowboy Woody got in on the action with his own video.
