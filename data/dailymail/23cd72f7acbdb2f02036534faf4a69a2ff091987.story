Frank Lampard admits to a sense of disbelief at his sensational start to his loan spell at Manchester City which saw the former England midfielder voted as the club's player of the month.

Lampard, who could start against Tottenham in the Saturday lunchtime match with Yaya Toure returning late to City from international duty, scored a vital equaliser against his old club Chelsea, two more in the Capital One Cup against Sheffield Wednesday and a further goal in the win at Hull.

Lampard told City's official website: 'If somebody had said I would be voted player of the month by the fans in my first full month playing I would have had difficulty believing them.

'To beat James Milner and David Silva is really flattering and especially James, who has had a fantastic start to the season and is someone who doesn't always get the plaudits he deserves - though I've found that's not the case with City fans who are very appreciative of him and what he brings to the team.

'I think my goals probably edged it but Milly deserves a big shout out as well.'

Lampard, 36, is likely to be given a hostile reception by Spurs fans but will be looking to build on an impressive record against the White Hart Lane club.

He added: 'I've done all right against Spurs over the years and playing them was always a big game at Chelsea.

'I think they'll be up and around the top six this season. They may go through a slight transitional period but I was very impressed with their manager when he was at Southampton and if he can bring the same imprint on Tottenham, who arguably have more quality within their squad, they'll do really well.

'I'm sure their aim is to get into the Champions League, but it won't be easy and there is a lot of competition and there are a lot of teams all trying to achieve the same goal.'
