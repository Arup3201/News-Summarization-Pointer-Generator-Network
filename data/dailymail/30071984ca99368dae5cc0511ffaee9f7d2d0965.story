More than 34 houses worth in excess of £1 million are sold every day according to new figures released today by the Land Registry. 

The House Price Index showed that in April 2014, 1,028 houses sold for seven figures, with 214 reaching in excess of £2 million.  

Chelsea has become the most desirable spot to live in London among the super rich as Russian oligarchs drive a billionaire property boom in west London. 

In April 2014, 735 homes sold in the capital for more than £1 million. Of the mansions reaching seven figures, almost 200 of them cost more than £2 million. 

The Boltons in Chelsea is currently on sale for £39.5 million which would cost a further £2.75 million in stamp duty for any prospective owner 

The luxury house is one of the many which is fueling a seven-figure property boom across the country with 34 houses worth more than £1 million selling daily

Over the past 12 months, there were 478 properties sold in Chelsea costing more than seven figures with 57 in excess of £5 million according  to new figures 

According to new figures, Chelsea is now far more desirable among oligarchs and billionaires than the traditional wealthy spots of Kensington, Mayfair and Knightsbridge.

Over a 12 month period there were 478 sales in Chelsea - with 57 of those homes costing in excess of £5 million.

Kensington was the second most popular destination for wealthy home buyers, with 340 sales in the area - 44 of which cost more than £5 million.

In third place was St John’s Wood, where there were 259 sales with 20 costing more than £5 million.

Making up the top six were Knightsbridge, with 145 sales (45 were £5m+), Belgravia with 140 (29 at £5m+) and Mayfair, where there were 105 sales (19 at £5m+).

The most expensive home sold in Chelsea was 11 Upper Phillimore Gardens, a seven bed mansion which fetched £28.5 million.

In England and Wales, 1028 properties sold for seven figures in April 2014 alone, compared with 740 in April 2013 - an increase of 39 per cent 

Next was a seven bedroom home on Cottesmore Gardens, which sold for £19.75 million, followed by 50 Chelsea Square, a six bed pad that cost its new owner £13.5 million.

Between them, the buyers of these three houses ended up paying more than £4.3 million in stamp duty.

Chelsea, which is made up of six ‘hamlets’ spread across almost 3,000 acres, is home to the likes of oligarch Roman Abramovich, socialite Amanda Eliyash and rock star Mick Jagger.

The borough has the largest population of American citizens outside of the USA, making up 6.53 per cent of the current population of Chelsea.

This is according to research by London estate agency Russell Simpson, which analysed statistics from LonRes.

Alan Russell, from the agency, said: 'Chelsea is an area that is talked about globally.

'It is iconic, people from Britain and abroad aspire to live here, it has always been one of the most sought after areas in London.

'This has been highlighted in recent months, as Chelsea has outsold its prime Central London neighbours.' 

According to the new figures, the average price of a new home is worth 172,011, an increase of 6.4 per cent on 2013 with huge variations across the country. 

In London an average house is now £437,000 compared with £98,500 in the North East. Houses in Blackburn are reduced in value by more than eight per cent over the past 12 months compared with Lambeth where they have jumped by more than a quarter.

House prices in England and Wales have shown stronger increases in London and areas of the South East, while parts of Wales and the North West have been stagnant 

In the capital, house prices are increasing at 15 per cent, faster than they did at the height of the last boom in late 2009, while nationwide growth is nearer five per cent
