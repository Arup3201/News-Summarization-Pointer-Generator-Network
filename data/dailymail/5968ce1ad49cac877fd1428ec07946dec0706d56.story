A Swiss zoo has provoked an outcry after putting down a brown bear cub because it was being bullied by its 'jealous' father.

The cub was among two born earlier this year to Misha and Masha, who were gifts from then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in 2009.

But keepers at Bern's Dahlholzi Zoo refused to separate the animals - even after Misha killed his other cub in front of horrified families last week.

Horrified: The cub, pictured, was put down by keepers this week at Dahlholzi Zoo in the Swiss capital Bern

Distress: The cub, nicknamed Baby Bear 4, was not separated from its father even after its twin Baby Bear 3 was killed in the enclosure. It is common for males and even females to kill their own cubs

Keepers claimed the mother of the cub, right, was neglecting it and they could not account for nature's course

When 360kg male Misha started being aggressive towards Baby Bear 4, as the cub was called, zoo chiefs decided to kill it instead of raising it in solitude.

But
Swiss Animal Protection, the country's oldest and largest animal rights group, was in uproar.

It condemned the action in the 'strongest possible terms' and said the zoo has massively 
mishandled the situation.

A
 spokesman for the group added: 'It is not natural to keep the male bear 
with the offspring, and there was more than enough space to have kept 
him in a separate part of the cage.'

In
 the wild, female bears typically drive away males to protect cubs because
males can see them as rivals and attempt to kill them.

Despite this, the zoo defended its position even after the first cub was killed last Wednesday.

Keepers said separating Misha or Masha from their cub would lead to other problems, and cause lasting damage for the welfare of all the bears involved.

Attack: Horrified families looked on last week as Misha killed the first of the two cubs, pictured. Males often turn against their cubs because they see them as competition, and even females can attack their young

Killed: The other cub, Baby Bear 3, being mauled by its father last week

JÃ¼rg Hadorn, the zoo's deputy director, said: 'After 12 weeks it was clear that Masha was irreparably neglecting her role as mother of cub number four.

'Together with the fact that the male bear Misha had started demonstrating the same aggressive behaviour as he did to cub number three, in order to protect cub number four from more stress and pain, we decided to act. As a result the baby bear was euthanised by a vet.

'It remains unclear now as then as to why our bears behaved in this way. After killing cub number three on April 2 there was an uneasy truce for 48 hours but since the weekend Misha again started to show the same aggression.

'Attempting to distract them and temporarily separating the older animals has only brought short-term easing of the situation. But it also resulted in Masha ignoring the cub even more.

'Misha and Masha are lovely hand-reared orphaned bears who came to us in 2009. They never had the chance to learn from other bears how to behave and their mothers were killed by poachers.

Euthanised: The cub put down by the zoo (pictured) was born in January and was one of two

Expert: Brown bear specialist Prof Djuro Huber said bears' natural aggression was well-known and it was 'a shame to allow the male to kill his cub in the zoo'

'We have tried when they were here to keep as much distance between them and humans as possible. Our priority is the two adult bears.

'Having young animals is a natural part of the life cycle of every animal and we wanted to ensure that Misha and Masha had the chance as well. But the loss of the young animals in a biological sense and also according to basic principles of good animal protection are less serious than the loss of an adult.

'The loss of cub number four has affected all of us here. Because Misha and Masha appeared to be clearly unable to fulfil their role as parents, Misha will be sterilised in the next few weeks.'

He
 added he did not want to see a repeat of Knut the polar bear - who was 
effectively sentenced to a life of solitude in a Berlin zoo after being 
rejected by his mother.

In 2007, an animal rights activist controversially said Knut should have been killed rather than being held in captivity alone.

Yet
 when two cubs were born at another Swiss zoo in January this year, 
keepers solved the problem by separating the parents and leaving the 
cubs with their mother.

Different policy: Sixty miles away, two cubs born at the Juraparc animal park were separated from their father

Happy family: A cub in Jaraparc with its mother. The Bern zoo said it was worse to lose an adult than a cub

Ursina gave birth to King and Zoe at Juraparc animal park near Vallorbe - just 60 miles from Bern.

Professor Djuro Huber, chairman of the brown bear expert team for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, said bears' natural aggression was well-known and it was 'a shame to allow the male to kill his cub in the zoo'.

He told MailOnline: 'In nature the male bear separates from the female after mating season and is not present with his cubs.

'It is not unusual that the male kills his cubs in captivity. Even the mother sometimes does.'

But he added: 'Zoos have too many captive bears and it is almost impossible to send them somewhere. Surplus bears have to be euthanised, and it is better to do that at a very young age when the mortality in nature is also the highest.'
