Health officials have destroyed $250,000 worth of a diet pill after a Hawaii man fell into a coma and needed a liver transplant to survive.

Kenneth Waikiki, 22, from Kailua-Kona, who was active but wanted to lose a few pounds, started taking OxyElite Pro this past summer.

A month later, he almost lost his life. ‘At first, we thought it was food poisoning,’ says Waikiki to Hawaii News Now.

Almost died: Kenneth Waikiki, 22, from Kailua-Kona, fell into a coma with liver failure after taking the diet supplement, OxyElite Pro, for one month

Deadly sick: Waikiki's eyes and skin turned yellow

Then his eyes and skin turned yellow. Waikiki was flown to a Honolulu hospital but his condition got worse and soon was in a coma.

‘He didn't wake up,’ says his mother, Judy, as she remembers the long nights at the hospital. 

She didn't want to leave her son's side, worried that he might die.

‘I was there when he first came [into the world] if he had to leave, I had to be there,’ she says.

His liver had failed and his only way to survive was if he got a liver transplant.

On September 30, in the middle of the night, the call came that a liver was on the way from California. On October 1, Waikiki had the transplant. 

He is now at his home in Kailua-Kona and has to take a cocktail of medications several times a day.

His mother says it is ‘a miracle’ that her son survived. The family is now suing the manufacturer, USPlabs LLC and GNC Holdings, Inc., according to Hawaii News Now.

Waikiki will not be able to drink alcohol again, but jokes that his friends will always have a designated driver now.

'Miracle': His mother says she is overwhelmed that her son is still alive, thanks to the liver transplant

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state investigators, who opened an inquiry into the incident, have found the supplement to contain Ageline, a synthetic version
of a natural extract from the Bael tree, according to the Hawaii 
Reporter.

Aegeline has not been proven to be safe and has not been approved by the FDA for inclusion in dietary supplements.

The OxyElite Pro product was sold at GNC retail locations in Hawaii.

The manufacturer and retailer who sold OxyElite Pro was ordered to recall all of its products, none of which are being sold anymore.

The Hawaii Department of Health 
destroyed $250,000 worth of the product on Tuesday – the bottles were 
seized from stores and burned.

Waikiki’s mother said she is thankful her son is still alive and that the product is no longer being sold.

‘I don't wish this on anyone,’ she told Hawaii News Now.

Dangerous: The FDA found that OxyElite Pro contained Aegeline, a synthetic version of a natural extract from the Bael tree, which has not been approved as safe to consume

On Tuesday a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii against the manufacturer, according to the Reporter.

They claim the synthetic dietary supplement was the source of an outbreak of acute liver failure and hepatitis among residents of Hawaii.

The plaintiff, Everine Van Houten, a Hawaii County resident, says in the lawsuit that she purchased two containers of OxyElite Pro from a GNC store in March.

Van Houten consumed both the regular OxyElite Pro tablets and a 'new' formulation of OxyElite Pro over the next several months.

She
was treated for symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue and muscle 
aches on numerous occasions at Hilo Medical Center during that time 
frame.

Liver illness: Everine Van Houten, a Hawaii County resident, is suing the manufacturer for causing 'very severe' liver injuries after she had taken the supplement

Van Houten alleges that she underwent multiple tests and medical procedures to determine the nature and extent of her liver illness.

Then she saw a public health notice in September advising of a possible link between cases of acute hepatitis and OxyElite Pro products.

Her attorney, Bruce Clark, said the liver injuries associated with the product were ‘very severe’. 

‘One would expect that companies selling a ‘wellness’ product would be scrupulous in ensuring the product is safe for consumers. That certainly does not appear to be the case with OxyElite Pro.’
