A couple had some unexpected wedding crashers this weekend when their big day was over run by Occupy protesters.

Thousands were expected to march in downtown Chicago today to the lakeside McCormick Place convention center where President Obama and dozens of other world leaders will meet for the Nato summit.

Newlyweds Tim and Beth Alberts left the church in the city centre on Saturday after exchanging their vows and found themselves in the middle of a mass demonstration.

With her mouth open aghast at the sight of the anti-capitalist activists, a furious Mrs Alberts was caught on video telling the wedding party: 'Let's get out of here.'

Both Chicago residents, Mr Alberts is a law clerk at Brady, Connolly & Masuda and Mrs Alberts is a medical aesthetician at Cellular Intelligence Med Spa.

Hundreds of protestors paid little heed to the newlyweds on their march through the city. The anti-NATO protests were also aimed at Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's budget cuts.

There were high tensions and frequent clashes between protesters and police today as violence broke out in pockets around the city.

Police in riot gear surrounded the downtown areas of Grant Park and the Loop and also patrolled train stations.

Protesters began arriving at 6.30 am at the park and set up under the trees to shade themselves from the sun.

The hacking group Anonymous said it had attacked the websites of the city of Chicago and police department because of a violation of human rights.

Officials said they were still investigating how the sites went down in a possible cyber attack.

The sites shut down this morning. In one Anonymous tweet, the group claimed to have taken the police site out of commission as the Nato summit began in the city today.Â 

All sites were now back up and running.

Following the rally in the park, protesters planned to march to the convention center at McCormick Place. Around the Nato summit, concrete barriers have been set up along with black, anti-scale fencing. Some businesses and homes in the area have taken the precaution of boarding up their windows.

Chris Geovanis of the Chicago and New Media Collective told the thousands gathered in the park that police had interfere with the march and hurt some protesters, according to the Chicago Tribune.

The Reverend Jesse Jackson also appeared and said the protests must remain non-violent.

He said: 'We learned from Dr. King in Birmingham. We march in a disciplined, non-violent way. We cannot afford to have our message hijacked by acts of provocation.'

There have been 18 arrested over the past week - not including the five people arrested on suspicion of two separate terrorist plots to use Molotov cocktails during the summit.

Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai met this morning at the opening of the Nato summit to discuss Afghanistan's 2014 elections, as well as the prospect of a political settlement with the Taliban.

The crowds were in the hundreds on Saturday, down from an estimated 2,500 people on Friday at Daley Plaza - named after Mayor Richard J. Daley, who headed the city during bloody clashes between police and anti-Vietnam War protesters at the 1968 Democratic convention.

Chicago police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said late last night that there had been 18 arrests during the week. One protester was taken to a hospital after a group of people swarmed on a police vehicle and slashed a tire, he added.

Local media showed video of the man in front of the vehicle trying to stop it but it was unclear if he was run over.

Another protester spray-painted an 'A' for anarchy on the door of a Verizon Wireless store.

Saturday's marches began early, with an estimated 500 people protesting outside Mayor Rahm Emanuel's home to criticise cuts in city mental health services.

Mr McCarthy said protesters were 'making noise and disrupting some people's lives,' but that overall, events were going well.

President Obama and First Lady Michelle were greeted on their arrival to Chicago last night by Emanuel, his former chief of staff, and his wife Amy Rule  on the tarmac at O'Hare International Airport.

Earlier Obama had wound up talks with fellow members of the G8 regarding the eurozone financial crisis and attempts to keep Greece in the Euro.

The city of Chicago had not granted a permit for Saturday's protests but police allowed several groups of protesters to wander around the city guided by officers mostly on bicycles.

There was some pushing and shoving between police and protesters but no major clashes.

Saturday's protests followed the announcement that three men arrested earlier in the week had been charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism.

Prosecutors said the three self-described anarchists were planning to attack President Barack Obama's Chicago campaign headquarters and Emanuel's home.

Saturday's protests stressed economic and social policy issues rather than international questions, such as the war in Afghanistan, expected to be discussed by world leaders at the NATO summit on Sunday and Monday.

Three protest leaders said they met with Nato Ambassador Kolinda Grabar of the military alliance's public diplomacy unit

'My message to Ambassador Grabar was that we are very aware of the immense violence and oppression that the U.S. in its Nato guise does to the world, and that no amount of words from her or pronouncements from the summit itself will obscure that,' said Andy Thayer, one of the protest leaders

Many of the protesters were from the Occupy Wall Street movement that began in New York last autumn to protest policies that lead to income inequality. The group says 1 per cent of the U.S. population holds too much of the nation's wealth.
