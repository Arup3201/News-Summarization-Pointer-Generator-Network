Amne Alrifai said Muslim women have become too frightened to leave their own homes

Muslims communities in Sydney have organised 'chaperoning services' for women on public outings after a rise in abuse and vandalism.

They say there has been a rise in attacks since the anti-terror raids three weeks ago, as well as reports of Australians fighting for the Islamic State in recent months.

There has been 30 attacks reported on Muslims because of their religion since the first anti-terror raids in Sydney on September 18, according to the Muslim Legal Network. Most of these attacks were on women wearing the traditional Muslim hijab, the organisation says.

Now men are offering to step in and chaperone women wearing hijabs while they are out in public doing their shopping, during the school drop off and pick up, and escort them where they need to go to ensure their safety.

The support is being organised through the Australian Non Muslims supporting Muslims Facebook group, which opened in September and already has more than 8000 members. 

On the Facebook page, the group said the rising trend of 'Islamaphobia and discrimination encountered every day by Muslims living in Australia is unacceptable.'

A group member, Amne Alrifai, 23, who was born and raised in Liverpool in Sydney's south-west, said that Muslim women are facing so much aggression in Western Sydney that they are becoming too frightened to leave their own homes.

'The chaperoning has been required as a result of many reports of harassment from within the community,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'Facebook was a hotbed of reports of harassment and women were starting to fear that they would be next.

'The men offering chaperoning services put the call out for everyone, but focused on women without a 'muhram' or male relative, so that they may accompany these ladies during their daily errands and to ease their fears. 

‘They just want to live their lives peacefully and should not need chaperones to feel safe enough to do their shopping.’

The services are organised through a Facebook page called Australian Non Muslims supporting Muslims, which opened in September and has over 8000 members

The 23-year-old said her newsfeed has been rife with accounts of abuse and photographs of vandalised properties, with all sorts of terrible, disgusting messages being left on cars, homes and places of worship of Muslims.

‘People's cars and backyards have been spray painted, with some saying: ‘F**** MUSLIM’ and most of it is happening in the suburb where I spent most of my life growing up,’ she said.

‘Now, what would drive someone to do something so disgusting?

‘It is terrifying that these violent, angry bigots do not see that they are walking the same line that ISIS does.

‘Yes, there have not been any beheading's in the streets, but why should I have to be concerned for my safety in the streets of Australia because of my religious beliefs?’

Among recorded incidents, a Muslim women had her hijab pulled off her head and thrown to the ground at Casula Mall in Sydney’s south-west, which has left her feeling threatened.

'How is it that anyone can think it’s reasonable to react to violence perpetrated in the name of Islam by fighting innocent, Muslim women?’ she said.

‘I started receiving messages from people I barely know, asking me if I was okay because their Muslim friend had been hassled in the streets.

‘We shouldn’t have to be texting each other to see if we’re okay. We shouldn’t have to change the way we live our lives either.’

‘I had never seen such a widespread affect. I mean, a few isolated incidents, sure. But almost everyone? Never.

Ms Alrifai, who now lives in Canberra, said she is also mortified and concerned about the possibility of ‘young Muslim men falling into cult-like groups, such as ISIS’.

‘As an Australian Muslim, I’m mortified about the possibility of young Muslim men abandoning their Islamic teachings of love and kindness and falling within the folds of yet another terrorist organisation, threatening the world,' she said. 

‘We, [Muslims of Australia] are under pressure and the worst thing to think about is that these people who have been charged are Australian.

'We need to have the support networks in place to identify when these youths are going down this path and prevent it from happening.

‘On the other hand, we’re trying to defend ourselves from bigots who don’t realise how similar they are to the ‘terrorists’.

‘These guys are the terrorists of Australia, and I denounce them in the same way I denounce ISIS.

'I fear them as much as I fear ISIS. They are just as much a threat to my personal safety and security as ISIS – if not moreso. They are in my backyard.

‘It’s terrifying, and I feel sorry for the parents of these men. If I’m feeling this broken, I can’t imagine how they’re feeling now.

Ms Alrifai moved to Canberra two years ago and said she has never had to deal with any racism or discrimination in the nation’s capital.

‘In fact, sometimes I forget that I wear a hijab. But Liverpool will always be home, as inglorious a place as it can be,’ she said.

Ms Alrifai said the media coverage of ‘terrorism’ at the moment is overwhelming but what makes it different this time is that it’s a threat on Australian soil.

'What we need is more coverage about the acts of support and unity and the overwhelming amount of good contributed to Australia by Muslims.

'People who commit crimes against Australian Muslims should be made to feel that they are the unwelcome minority in the public’s opinion, not the other way around.

‘Acts of violence committed by someone claiming to be Muslim is so often reported as ‘terrorism’, has become a word that has lost all meaning.

‘We’re just the same as everyone else and we’re just as outraged by the idea of violence in our country.’

Amne Alrifai, 23, who was born and raised in Liverpool, said that Muslim women have faced so much aggression in Western Sydney; they have become too frightened to leave their own homes

She said the increased violence against Muslims is counter-productive and has created a further divide between the Muslim and non-Muslim community.

‘I would never claim that all Muslims are perfect, or that the Islamic community is doing everything possible to identify and prevent the radicalisation of our youth. We have a lot left to do - we’re working on it.

‘What I know for a fact is that we find ISIS to be just as terrifying and abhorrent as the rest of the world. We are just as worried about what the future holds.’

Ms Alrifai said she hopes to see a united Australia that appreciates that most Muslims just want to live normal lives and that they are all an important voice in this dialogue

Despite all the threats and concerns in the Muslim community, Ms Alrifai said she hopes to see a united Australia that appreciates that most Muslims just want to live normal lives and that they are all an important voice in this dialogue.

‘I’m hoping to a see a stronger Islamic community that is aware enough to prevent home-grown terrorism and resilient enough to ensure that the majority of Muslims, who are just normal people, feel safe and supported.

‘An Australia where non-Muslims can rest assured that they are safe. I want to see Australia where following a certain religion, coming from a particular culture, loving a particular person and being of a particular skin colour does not result in harassment.

‘I know I can’t speak for all Muslims, but I have spent the last week and a half fighting what feels like a losing battle on every front.

‘However, I am glad that the Islamic community is coming together to support each other. It's something we haven't been so good at in the past.'

‘Everything is going to be okay in the end, and if it’s not okay, it’s not the end.’
