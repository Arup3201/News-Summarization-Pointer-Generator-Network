On the run: Amanda Cooney, 25, was arrested after being found in a motel room with a 16-year-old student in Ohio

A teacher has been arrested after being caught on the run with her 16-year-old student at a motel.

Amanda Cooney, 25, is believed to have abandoned her own children to be with the teenage boy who was wanted by police and has been described as 'armed and dangerous'.

She was led in handcuffs from the cheap Days Inn in Riverside, Ohio, and will be returned to her native Florida to face charges.

Lieutenant Andrew Schneider, at Crestview Police Department, Florida confirmed to
MailOnline today that Cooney was in the process of being extradited on charges of burglary, car theft, fraudulent use 
of a credit card and forgery.

The teen, who cannot be named but was identified as one of her students, was also arrested.

The exact nature of the offences the boy was facing have not been revealed but he was also being extradited to Florida.

Cooney, a teacher at the Okaloosa 
Academy Charter School in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, had resigned from her 
position before going on the run.

Officials at the school said she left a week ago saying she had been called to pick up her own children from school.

When school administrators checked, they discovered that Cooney hadn't picked them up.

The teacher then failed to show up for work the following day. When her classroom was checked, a note was found saying she had resigned along with an apology for quitting in such an abrupt way.

The pair were discovered around 1,000 miles away in Ohio after police became suspicious of Cooney's car which was packed with personal possessions.

Riverside Deputy Police Chief Michael Brown said: 'Quite honestly [it had] quiet a bit of stuff inside it, almost like a 
hoarder.'

After running a licence plate check they discovered she was wanted on outstanding warrants.

Inside the $100-a-night motel they found the teen who had been reported missing by his parents.

They also found a handgun inside the room. What the two had planned is still unknown.

Charges against Cooney have not yet been announced by Montgomery County authorities, however she has been charged with interfering with a missing child by Florida police.
