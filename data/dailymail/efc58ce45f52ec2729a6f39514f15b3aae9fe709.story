A string of car bomb attacks across Iraq killed at least 37 people and wounded dozens more, Iraqi officials said. 

Three of the attacks targeted Shi'ite districts in the capital, Baghdad, while the fourth targeted a Kurdish neighborhood in the oil-rich northern city of Kirkuk.

Police officials said the first attack targeted a line of small restaurants in the Shi'ite district of Sadr City on Thursday night, killing 11 people and wounding 25 others.

The disputed oil hub of Kirkuk, about 240 kilometres (150 miles) north of Baghdad, is an ethnically mixed city which lies outside the recognised autonomous Kurdish region but is currently under the full control of the Kurdish peshmerga forces.

The last major bomb attack in Kirkuk was in August when triple blasts, including two targeting the Kurdish security forces, left 38 dead.

Violence has increased in the Kirkuk region in recent weeks as ISIS fighters are being squeezed out of some of the positions they had held in the east of the country since June.
