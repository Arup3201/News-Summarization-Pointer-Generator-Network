Try finding Lionel Messi's top goals on YouTube and you'll understand how many there are.

With so many to choose from, it's difficult to pinpoint just 10 after a decade of watching the Barcelona master at work.

But we've done it and here, Sportsmail presents 10 of Messi's best-ever goals from his career at the Nou Camp.

The 'Diego Maradona' goal (against Getafe, 2007)

In 1986, a newspaper posed a question to Diego Maradona after he single-handedly cut through the England team to score one of the greatest-ever goals: 'What planet did you come from?'

After Messi's similar goal in 2007 against Getafe, the question was repeated.

Starting in his own half and taking on five players, including the goalkeeper, Messi scored a goal that deserves a place on the mantelpiece as Barcelona beat Getafe 5-2 in the Copa del Rey semi-final.

That header (against Manchester United, 2009)

Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United learned the hard way that, despite his height, you can't leave Messi unmarked in the box when the ball's in the air.

Meeting a looping cross by Xavi in the 2009 Champions League final, 5ft 6½in Messi headed the ball beyond 6ft 5½in goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar from the most awkward of angles to complete the 2-0 victory.

Messi proved he could be just as deadly with his head as he is with his feet for Barcelona in the 2009 final

Sheer power (against Arsenal, 2010)

Arsenal were leading 1-0 at the Nou Camp, thanks to a Nicklas Bendtner goal in the 19th minute.

Barcelona needed inspiring and Messi, with four goals, did just that in this Champions League tie.

It was the forward's equaliser that arguably stole the show when a fortunate one-two with Arsenal defender Mikael Silvestre allowed Messi to put his laces through the ball. Keeper Manuel Almunia could do nothing.

On the chest (against Estudiantes, 2009)

A fiercely-whipped cross found Messi who, instead of ducking to use his head, opted to go for the  chest against Estudiantes in 2009.

It proved just as clinical as the ball sailed into the far-right corner beyond goalkeeper Damian Albil and won Barcelona the FIFA Club World Cup final in 2009.

The flick (against Deportivo, 2013)

The most nonchalant goal you'll ever see. Technique, a cool head, pace, it had the lot.

The Barcelona star starts with the ball outside the box and, after a one-two down the right-hand side, Messi cheekily flicks the ball over onrushing goalkeeper Daniel Aranzubia.

The nutmeg (against Sevilla, 2012)

Messi loves a nutmeg almost as much as he loves a chip. Against Sevilla in 2012, he opted for both.

The Barcelona forward was fed the ball on the edge of the box. He left Emir Spahic for dead, sliding the ball through the defender's legs, before sublimely chipping goalkeeper Andres Palop.

The dancer (against Real Zaragoza, 2010)

Real Zaragoza thought rugby tackling Messi might stop the forward. They soon found out that was wrong.

As part of a hat-trick, Messi shakes off rough defending in the middle of Zaragoza's half before running at the back-line, turning those up against him inside out.

He takes on four men - one of them twice, who is left in a spin - before drilling a low shot beyond goalkeeper Jimenez Gago Roberto. 'A one-man show,' the commentator says afterwards.

The off-guard (against Atletico Madrid, 2012) 

Catching the goalkeeper off guard while he's organising his wall isn't always as easy as it looks, particularly from this angle against then-Atletico Madrid's Thibaut Courtois.

Positioned on the left of the 18-yard box, Messi's curled shot somehow dips and lands in the far-right corner of the net. Afterwards, the commentator labels him a 'ball whisperer'. Hard to disagree.

The trickster (against Arsenal, 2011)

Unfortunately for Arsenal, Messi seems to have a knack for scoring sensational goals against them.

The Barca star finds himself through and Almunia narrows Messi's options by rushing forward, only for the Argentine to flick the ball over the goalkeeper before tapping it into the net.

Whether he could do this on a cold, wet, windy Monday night at Stoke is another matter.

A Great Escape (against Real Madrid, 2011)

There can be no better game for Messi to exhibit his skills than in El Clasico.

So, in 2011, the Barcelona forward decided to single-handedly double his team's lead in this Champions League semi-final at the Bernabeu.

He picked the ball up from Sergio Busquets in Real Madrid's half before skipping past five challenges and finishing beyond goalkeeper Iker Casillas.
