A Palestinian barber has not allowed the destruction of his shop during the conflict between Hamas and Israel to put him out of business.

The shop in Absen, near the town of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza strip was badly damaged as a result of the heavy shelling. 

The entire store front was destroyed and some internal ceilings collapsed, but amazingly, several large mirrors survived the heavy bombardment.

Despite losing the store front and part of his ceiling, the barber returned to work earlier this week

The return to normality comes as the United Nations prepares to discuss the future of the region, including plans to rebuild buildings and roads destroyed by artillery and air strikes. 

The supply of construction material - including concrete -  to the Gaza strip has been controversial as the Israelis have accused the Palestinian authority of allowing Hamas to use the supplies to construct cross-border tunnels and underground bunkers. 

However, the United States said it will open a new United Nations resolution on Gaza, but only if it will help build on the fragile Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire.

Peace talks between both sides are expected to resume in Cairo, Egypt in the coming days. 

America's ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power said any resolution must 'do no harm' to the current cease-fire'. 

She said: 'Nothing underscores the urgency of securing ... a negotiated two-state solution like the crisis in Gaza and the heartbreak that so many people on both sides suffered throughout that crisis.'

Ms Power said that the only way of securing the desired two-state solution was through negotiation.

As confidence in the ceasefire grows an increasing number of Palestinians are making their way home 

Many Palestinians have returned only to discover that their homes have been badly bomb-damaged 

She said: 'We don't think there are shortcuts or unilateral measures that can be taken at the United Nations or any place else that will bring about the outcome that the Palestinian people most seek,' she said.

'If you mean to secure a permanent peace, Israel has to be a part of that negotiation, just as a practical matter,' Power said. 'So to think that you can come to New York and secure what needs to be worked out on the ground is not realistic, and in fact, is likely to have very counterproductive effects.' 

A draft resolution circulated by the United States, Israel's closest ally, and obtained by The Associated Press calls for the re-establishment of full Palestinian Authority control over Gaza, which was ruled by Hamas militants who refuse to recognize the state of Israel.

US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power said a two-state solution was only possible with negotiation

It includes a key Israeli demand, affirming that a lasting solution must ensure that Gaza is 'free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those under the full and legitimate control of the Palestinian Authority.'

The Security Council is also considering 'elements' for a resolution proposed by European nations, and a Jordanian draft resolution backed by the Palestinians and their supporters which was written before the latest cease-fire .

The European proposal goes further than the Americans, calling for the establishment of an international Monitoring and Verification Mission in Gaza to ensure that the cease-fire agreement is implemented and to investigate reported violations. 

The U.S. draft asks Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to consult with both sides 'on options for the establishment of a mechanism' to assist in the transfer of construction materials to rebuild Gaza and 'to monitor and verify the end-use of dual-use material.'

Hanan Ashrawi, a senior figure in the Palestine Liberation Organisation, told a news conference in New York that the Palestinians wanted an international commitment to the return to the pre-1967 borders and a complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories within 'three years'.
