YouTube's recent 'new look' changed the focus of the video-clip site from individual videos to 'channels' similar to ones on television.

The site's transformation into a rival to TV services seems set to continue. The latest service from the video giant, YouTube Slam, is a weekly talent show where users vote on their favourite comedy, music and viral clips.

YouTube bills it as a 'video discovery experiment' - it also has videogame-like elements, where users earn points for accurately predicting favourites.

YouTube's Slam lets users vote for their favourite comedy, music and viral videos of the week - another TV-like element which will help YouTube compete with other TV providers

'Have some free time this week? Think you can find the next singing sensation, viral video like Charlie bit my finger or Surprised Kitty?' said the official YouTube blog this week.'Each week a new crop of videos battles head-to-head in Comedy, Cute, Music, Bizarre and Dance Slams, where your votes determine who wins the Slam and gets featured on the leaderboard.'Earn points for predicting the crowd favorites, and see how you stack up against other players at the end of each week.'

The move is another unusual shift for YouTube, which remained broadly the same for years until Google started offering 'channels' with professional content earlier this year, then rolled this into the site's 'new look'Â  in early December.

The 'competition' is a new, unfamiliar element - more akin to the apps and games on Facebook.

'YouTube is in a process of reinvention at the moment - a rival site, Vevo, is basically taking all of the music videos away from them,' Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst at the Music Industry blog told the BBC.'YouTube desperately need to create a new relevancy for themselves and that's why with the recent site relaunch - making it look more like a rich interactive TV-like experience - and features like Slam are all about trying to give YouTube a unique place in the online video landscape.'
