Energy Secretary Ed Davey has urged a probe into the scale of profits made by some gas companies

Shares in British Gas lost £600million in early trading yesterday after the Energy Secretary suggested the firm could be broken up over claims of profiteering.

Ed Davey said the company’s 11.2 per cent profit margin on gas was too high – and has written to regulators, raising the prospect they may see fit to break up British Gas and parent company Centrica.

Centrica makes its money from selling North Sea gas and by running electricity power stations.

Some say this supply business should be separated from British Gas, which sells gas and electricity to households and businesses.

The news sent shockwaves through the City with the value of shares of the UK’s largest energy supplier falling by as much as 4 per cent, or around £600million. They rebounded to end the day nearly 2 per cent down, which equates to a fall in value of around £270million. Centrica and British Gas, which has 41 per cent of the gas supply market and around 16million household accounts, insist their profit margins are modest and fair, running at around 5 per cent for gas and electricity combined.

Mr Davey said if you break out the figure for gas alone, the profit margin in 2012 was 11.2 per cent.

In a letter to Ofgem, he wrote: ‘There is evidence that British Gas, the company with the largest share of the gas domestic supply market, has tended to charge one of the highest prices over the past three years, and has been on average the most profitable.’

In an accompanying note, he asks: ‘Does this indicate that British Gas has a strong monopoly position which enables it to generate high profit margins?’

The letter, which was also sent to the Competition & Markets Authority, asks regulators to consider all possible remedies ‘including a break-up of any companies found to have monopoly power to the detriment of the consumer’.

British Gas insisted it was complying with an ongoing independent market assessment being conducted by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), Ofgem and the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA)

British Gas 
rejected the attack and said it is already participating in a market 
investigation by Ofgem, the Office of Fair Trading, Ofgem and the CMA.

Managing
 director, Chris Weston, hit back, saying: ‘Britain has one of the most 
competitive energy markets in the world, with gas and electricity prices
 among the lowest in western Europe.

‘Our
 parent company Centrica does more than any other organisation to secure
 gas and power for British customers, with commitments totalling more 
than £60billion, and we can only shoulder responsibilities on this scale
 if we are a profitable business.’

The
 GMB union joined the battle and accused Mr Davey of mounting a 
dangerous publicity stunt. Its national secretary for energy, Gary 
Smith, said: ‘Ed Davey has opportunistically unleashed a hugely damaging
 feeding frenzy on a British owned company.

‘This
 company has invested billions to securing reliable energy supplies for 
the UK. It employs and is committed to employing tens of thousands of 
workers in the UK.

‘British
 Gas is probably the biggest employer of apprentices and trainees in the
 UK. Hundreds of apprenticeships in smart metering that would have been 
created this year probably won’t be because of Davey’s dithering over 
policy. He now threatens to wreck thousands of more jobs.’

The share price fell by as much as 4 per cent in early trading, which is equivalent to a drop of around £600million.

It
 pared some of the losses by the end of the day to leave shares down 
nearly 2per cent, or 5.3p, to 308.9p, which equates to a fall of around 
£270m.
