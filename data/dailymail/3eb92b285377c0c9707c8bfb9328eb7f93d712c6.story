Animal rights activists are calling for a change to the law that allows people in Switzerland to roast their pet cats and dogs and serve the meat up on the dinner table.

SOS Cats animal charity insists that the 'barbaric' and 'outdated tradition', which it believes is secretly adopted by up to three per cent of the population, simply has to stop.

Roasted cat appears on traditional Christmas menus across certain areas of Switzerland, cooked with white wine and garlic in a similar way to rabbit.

Although human consumption of dog meat is mostly associated with Asian countries such as China, (pictured) Swiss farmers also eat the animals

'We especially see it in the regions of Lucerne, Appenzell, Jura and in the canton of Bern,' Tomi Tomek, founder of SOS Cats in Neuenburg, told the BBC.

Dog meat on the other hand goes mostly into making sausages and in some rural regions it is considered to be a fatty remedy for rheumatism.

Farmers in the areas of Appenzell and St Gallen  are said to be particularly fond of dog meat, with a breed related to the beefy Rottweiler thought to be a favorite for the dinner table.

One farmer from the Rhine Valley told local media: 'Meat is meat. There's nothing odd about it. Construction workers in particular like eating it.'

A loophole in Swiss law means that pet cats and dogs are not directly included in Swiss farming and agricultural welfare regulations.

Food Safety and Veterinary Authority spokeswoman Eva van Bek told the Daily Star: 'They must not be sold as a food item, they cannot be donated or offered for sale, but it is true that under current Swiss law owners cannot be prevented from eating their own pets.'

Around 16,000 people, including the life-long animal rights activist and campaigner Brigitte Bardot, have signed a petition that has been handed to the Swiss parliament, calling for the government to stop people eating 'domestic animals'.

Mr Tomek said: 'No-one in Switzerland is now so starving they have to eat their pet.

'If we have to use the courts to stop this case by case we will.

'These animals form part of a family, they must not end up on a dinner plate.

'I am seeking a parliamentarian who will table my petition - and I will find one.'
