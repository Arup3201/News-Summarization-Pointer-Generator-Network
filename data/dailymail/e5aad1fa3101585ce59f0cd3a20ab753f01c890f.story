A new study shows that minorities are given far less opportunity than their white peers, are taught by less experienced teachers, and made up the majority of students arrested.

According to the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, black students – especially males - are three and a half times as likely to be suspended or expelled, according to the report.

More than 70 per cent of students involved in school-related arrests or cases referred to law enforcement were Hispanic or African-American.

Subject to discipline: An education report says that minorities are much more likely to receive harsh discipline and get expelled

The findings come from a national collection of civil rights data from 2009-2010 of more than 72,000 schools serving 85 per cent of the nation.

'The sad fact is that minority students across America face much harsher discipline than non-minorities, even within the same school,' Education Secretary Arne Duncan told reporters.

Mr Duncan said some school officials might not have been aware of inconsistencies in how they handle discipline, and he hoped the report would be an eye-opener.

According to the report, 42 per cent of 
the referrals to law enforcement involve black students and 29 per cent 
involved Hispanics.

Disparate discipline: According to the study, black students represent 18 per cent of students in the sample, but 35 per cent of students suspended once and 39 per cent of those expelled

The study shows that those who teach at schools with a majority of black and Hispanic students are paid significantly less than their colleagues.

Teachers in high-minority schools are paid on average $2,251 less per annum, and were found to be less experienced as well.

However, in big cities like New York and Philadelphia, the discrepancy rose from $8,000 to more than $14,000.

Meanwhile, 35 per cent of students involved in school-related arrests were black and 37 per cent were Hispanic.

Black students made up 18 per cent of the students in the sample, but they were 35 per cent of students suspended once and 39 per cent of students expelled in total, the report said.

Civil rights education data was collected as early as 1968, but was halted in 2006 by the second bush administration, the New York Times reported.

The data has since been collected again, and serves as a window into how minorities are routinely discriminated against, especially those with disabilities, who are subjected at an alarmingly high number to restrains, seclusion, and even arrests.

Though they only comprised 12 per cent of the student body, a staggering 70 per cent of students with disabilities were subject to physical restraints.
