It is meant to be peak TV viewing time, when most of us have settled down to watch a favourite soap or drama.

But 8.05pm is also our preferred time to make online purchases - after we have got back from work and eaten dinner.

The solution is to divide attention by surfing the net for bargains while keeping one eye on the television, a survey has found.

Hi tech modern life: Brits are increasingly 
using their laptops, tablets and smartphones to shop as they watch 
television, according to new research

Just over half of British shoppers have revealed they buy goods and services over the internet while trying to keep up with what's on the box.

The practice is part of a growing trend which shows were are increasingly making our purchases online.

UK e-shoppers now spend an average of six hours shopping on the internet each month, parting with a quarter of their disposable income.

Exactly half said they had bought clothes in the past three months, while around two-fifths had purchased books and a similar figure music or CDs.

Amazon was the most popular site to visit, with 90 per cent of online shoppers using the business in the past three months.

eBay was second with 57 per cent, followed by department stores, clothes retailers and consumer electronics. Food shopping was another major sector.

Details emerged in the Global Online Shopper Report, conducted by payment services company WorldPay, and involved responses from 19,000 people in 15 leading economies.

In these countries, fewer and fewer people are relying on home computers in a fixed position. Just over half use a laptop, a fifth shop have a smartphone and one in ten rely on a tablet, such as an iPad.

This means that while an overwhelming 95 per cent of business is conducted in the home, it can take place in any room.

Just
over half shop while sitting in the living room and more than 
two-fifths in the bedroom. But five per cent opt for the garden and 
three per cent the bathroom.

Outside
the home, nearly a third of people have made purchases at work, one in 
12 while on holiday and one in 14 in a caf√©, bar, restaurant or pub.

Two in five people said they, or someone they knew, had been directly affected by online fraud. But more than half felt online shopping was more secure than 12 months ago.

Questions already being asked about the future of high streets will intensify after the survey revealed half of all UK shoppers expected to spend 50 per cent of their income online in the near future - a figure that rose to 64 per cent globally.

WorldPay chief product officer Philip McGriskin said: 'eCommerce is growing at a rapid pace. Whilst there are variants between consumer shopping habits globally, in general shoppers are turning online to shop.'
