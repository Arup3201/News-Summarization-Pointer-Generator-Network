Firebrand senator Jacqui Lambie is warning her opponents they will need at least an M60 gun to halt her plans to leave the Palmer United Palmer and become an independent.

Senator Lambie is looking to break from the party after a public spat with leader Clive Palmer over her pledge to vote against all government legislation until a defence force pay deal is reconsidered.

The controversial politician said Mr Palmer had been exhausting all options to try and influence her vote, including enlisting the help of fellow senator and rugby great Glenn Lazarus.

But Senator Lambie is standing her ground, telling the Sunday Telegraph she would not cave that easily.

Firebrand senator Jacqui Lambie is warning her critics will need at least an 'M60' gun to halt her plans to leave the Palmer United Palmer and become an independent 

'If you want to intimidate Jacqui Lambie you'll have to bring in a M60 and we will start with that,' Senator Lambie said.

'I won't be intimidated. I won't tolerate it. No, they'd be wasting their time trying to intimidate me sweetheart.'

Despite sources telling the News Corp newspaper Senator Lazarus marched into her office and pressed her to vote in line with her party, the former sportsman said this was not the case and all decisions were made by the caucus.

He said his main concern about the 'passionate and committed' politician was the advice her chief-of-staff was handing out to Senator Lambie. 

Speculation over Senator Lambie's future in the party has been mounting over the weekend as she seeks legal advice to see if she can run as an independent.

To go with her new role as independent, her chief-of-staff Rob Messenger said his boss had 'undergone a two-and-a-half-hour procedure at the hairdressers' and bought new clothes to get 'a new look'.

It comes after PUP leader Clive Palmer extended an olive branch to the troublesome senator, saying she is a team player who he wants to keep on board.

But her claims of intimidation and interference from the party leader has sparked retaliation from Mr Palmer who accused her of lying in parliament and scheming to start her own political party.

Despite the war of words, Mr Palmer is not giving up Senator Lambie, urging her to talk to him in person rather than through media.

Previously, Mr Palmer has said Senator Lambie had failed to attend party meetings and had not returned his phone calls or spoken to him for a month.

'I think she's a team player and we'd like to keep her on board,' he told ABC's Lateline on Thursday.

'If she wants to have a talk I'd have no problem doing that.'

Mr Palmer said he did not know where Senator Lambie's accusations of intimidation had come from and his party had done all it could to support her.

He excused her behaviour as a result of media pressure to break up the PUP team.

On Wednesday, Mr Palmer demoted the senator from her parliamentary positions of deputy Senate leader and deputy whip, and suspended her from all party meetings.

After removing PUP logos and references from her website, the Tasmanian senator split from her party colleagues in the upper house to vote against the government on a series of motions.

Senator Lambie has thrown her support behind the Australian Defence Veterans Party which is in the final stages of getting enough supporters to register with the Australian Electoral Commission.

She also denied claims she wanted to set up her own party.
