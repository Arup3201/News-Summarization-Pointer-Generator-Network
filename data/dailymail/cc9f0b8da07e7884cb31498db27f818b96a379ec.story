Party-mad Prince Harry locked horns with U.S. gold medal winner Ryan Lochte in an amazing 3am swimming race at a Las Vegas pool party during his hedonistic trip to sin city.

The pair cleared a makeshift path amid a group of bikini-clad girls for the showdown at the exclusive Wynn hotel and thrashed their way across the open air pool to the delight of the crowd.

As an Olympic gold medal winning swimmer it was no surprise that Lochte, 28, beat the 27-year-old Royal to the edge, but a topless Harry looked delighted with his performance.

Afterwards Lochte, who won two gold, two silver and one bronze medal in the London Olympics celebrated by punching the air before the pair embraced as dance music blared out in the XS nightclub.

The American wore a printed white t-shirt which became completely see-though as the water soaked it through.

The two men had not arrived at the party together but bumped in to each other in the VIP section of the club, one of four in the Las Vegas hotel, which features thirty luxury poolside cabanas.

According to the Wynn website the XS nightclub is 'inspired by the luscious curves of the human body.'

Harry was certainly inspired, enthusiastically throwing himself in to the party spirit - and the pool - in the early hours of the morning

At 3am, bare-chested but still in his jeans, the prince jumped in to the club’s huge open-air pool.

He was joined by the fully-clothed 
swimmer and Lochte theatrically counted down to 
three on one hand as he gave Harry a head start before heading off in 
hot pursuit.

Strangely – not least because he boasts several world records – Lochte only just beat the prince.

The truth, however, was revealed by 
another partygoer on Twitter, who said a fellow reveller had grabbed 
hold of  Lochte’s legs as he kicked off for the one-length race. The 
tactic didn’t quite pay off – though some insisted it was Harry who won.

Today Harry is preparing for a 
showdown with Clarence House after sensational pictures of the him 
cavorting naked in a Las Vegas hotel suite hit the Internet.

Wearing
nothing but a distinctive necklace, the prince is seen in the pictures 
giving a topless girl a 'bear-hug', his bare bottom facing the camera.

In another shot he uses his hands to protect his modesty while his brunette companion uses his nude body to shield hers.

Yesterday the sheepish prince was seen 
chatting to friends in Los Angeles car park and the third in line to the
throne refused to comment when quizzed by a reporter before he prepared
to travel home.

Should British newspapers and websites publish the nude pictures of Prince Harry in Las Vegas?

The scandalous nude pictures make his topless swimming race with the U.S. champion seem rather tame, but Lochte, who was in Las Vegas 
celebrating his 28th birthday still had fun.

He told the Mail in a statement: ‘It was 
really fun swimming against Prince Harry. He’s a great guy, and it was a
huge honor [sic] to meet him.

‘I was surprised that he challenged 
me actually. I didn’t know if he had any skills in the pool, but I 
definitely wasn’t going to take it easy on him!

‘He was a great competitor but in the
end it was Team USA all the way to the wall!!  Next time I’m in the UK 
it’d be fun to challenge him to something on his own turf.’

Harry managed to beat Usian Bolt in a 20-yard dash earlier this year – by distracting him at the start.

Earlier that day, Harry had found 
himself surrounded by a gaggle of leggy lovelies who had made a bee-line
for Las Vegas’s Encore Beach Club as news spread that the playboy 
prince was in town.

The 
prince had been filmed enjoying the poolside entertainment at the MGM 
Grand hotel and throwing a lingering glance towards one of the stunning 
bikini-clad women by a camera from television station 'Extra'.

Winding down: Prince Harry jetted out to Las Vegas - known as Sin City - for a little 'rest and recreation'

In white fedora and red floral shorts, 
27-year-old Harry lapped up the attention of his new fan club on the 
latest leg of what has been dubbed his ‘endless summer’ before returning
to the front line as a helicopter pilot.

He also lapped up copious amounts of 
his favourite Grey Goose vodka as well as some of the many cocktails on 
offer in Sin City.

Days after the London Olympics, at 
which he was an official ambassador for Team GB, Harry jetted out to the
US for a little ‘rest and recreation’.

This
took him to Vegas at the weekend, accompanied by two taxpayer-funded 
police bodyguards and his best friend, Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip.

The
party checked into a £450-a-night suite at the five-star Wynn hotel and
casino for some ‘full-on partying’, as the prince told one fellow 
guest.

The group were seen playing the dice game craps, to the cheering and whooping of their fellow gamblers.

The following day Harry and Co headed off to a £950-a-day poolside bungalow at another Las Vegas landmark, the MGM Grand.

The
hotel hosts raucous alcohol-fuelled parties four times a week under the
brand ‘Wet Republic’, which attract up to 1,600 revellers to its two 
giant saltwater pools.

Outside Harry’s bungalow was a private Jacuzzi from which the prince and his group chatted to a group of girls who had taken the cabana next door and ordered drinks from a menu boasting £65 pitchers of ‘dragonberry’ mojitos.

Just a few bungalows down was singer 
Jennifer Lopez, 43, and her dancer toyboy Casper Smart, 25, although it 
is understood they did not meet the prince.

At one point Harry borrowed a red 
singlet from the ‘bachelorette’ (an America term for hen party) girls 
next door and jumped on a friend’s shoulders, waving his hands in the 
air.

‘They had a blow-up 
whale in their area and were just fooling around, having some drinks and
enjoying themselves,’ an onlooker said.

The
excited ladies couldn’t resist taking to Twitter, posting pictures of 
them posing with the prince alongside giggly accounts of what a 
‘gentleman’ he was.

One member of staff also admitted having ‘creepily’ kept the water bottle from which he had drunk.

The following day the group were in 
the water again, this time at the 60,000 square foot Encore Beach Club 
for another ‘adult pool party’, taking a bungalow with its own infinity 
hot tub.

The entertainment was rounded off with
a visit to the resort’s XS nightclub where other VIP guests included US
Olympic champion swimmer Ryan Lochte.

Harry has recently re-trained as an 
elite Apache attack helicopter pilot and completed a period of 
pre-deployment training with hopes of returning to the front line in 
Afghanistan in the near future.

A spokesman stressed that he was on a private holiday and was not entitled to any more leave than his fellow pilots.

He attended the Olympics in his own time and was not given any special dispensation by the military.
