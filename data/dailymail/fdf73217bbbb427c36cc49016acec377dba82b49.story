Lord Campbell-Savours, a former Labour MP, condemned the ‘back-stabbing’ of Tony Blair by former supporters

Tony Blair has been the victim of ‘vomit-inducing’ attacks from people who once backed the invasion of Iraq, a Labour peer has claimed.

The former Prime Minister has been roundly criticised for his call for new military intervention to counter the rise of militant extremists in ISIS.

But Lord Campbell-Savours, a former MP, condemned the ‘back-stabbing’ of Mr Blair and insisted that the threat of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (WMD) was not the sole reason for backing the 2003 invasion.

Two weeks ago Mr Blair, who led Britain into the conflict alongside US President George W Bush, denied the appalling bloodshed was connected to the 2003 invasion.

‘We have to liberate ourselves from the notion that 'we' have caused this,’ the former Prime Minister wrote in an extraordinary essay. ‘We haven’t.’

He went on to call for decisive military response 'including military strikes against extremists in Iraq and Syria'.

The remarks sparked a furious backlash from across the political spectrum, including from senior Labour and Tory figures who supported the war in 2003.

Lord Campbell-Savours used a House of Lords debate on the situation in Iraq to condemn Mr Blair’s critics.

He told peers: ‘I supported the first intervention in the early 1990s and in 1997 to 2001 repeatedly called for and openly supported military intervention.

‘I was not alone and I find it what I can only describe as vomit-inducing to hear the back-stabbing of Blair from many who openly supported intervention and are now in denial.

‘The idea that most of us supported intervention on the single justification of WMD is nonsense. Our concerns went far wider.’

The 70-year-old was a Labour MP for Workington from 1979-2001, and served on Neil Kinnock’s frontbench in the 1980s and 1990s.

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has been heavily criticised for his call for new military intervention to tackle the threat posed by Islamist jihadists who have seized control of large areas of the Iraq

Speaking in last night’s debate, he said that in the run-up to the Iraq invasion the main concerns on both sides of the Atlantic had been the need to protect the Kurds, stop environmental destruction and population displacement in the south, and curtail the aspirations of Saddam to invade neighbouring states.

He added: ‘In my view one of the most important reasons, rarely talked about, was the need to remove Saddam's threat to the international oil economy.

‘That threat was a cause of volatility in international oil markets with the potential to destabilise economies and impact on the employment policies in the oil-dependent economies in the West - something we should still have in mind.

‘These are the real reasons for intervention, not WMD and my only criticism of Blair is that concerns over justification in international law drove us down the WMD route.’

His defence of Mr Blair comes after two weeks of heavy criticism for his call for Britain to join new military strikes to counter the threat posed by Islamist jihadists who have seized control of large areas of the Iraq, plunging the country into its bloodiest crisis since the withdrawal of US troops in 2011.

Lord Prescott, who served as Deputy Prime Minister at the time of the war, accused Mr Blair of trying to take the West 'back to the crusades'.

Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary at the time of the invasion, said it was 'impossible' to argue that the war ordered by Mr Blair 'played no part at all in today's events'.

Former Deputy PM Lord Prescott accused Mr Blair of wanting to take the West 'back to the crusades' but Lord Mandelson insisted the Iraq war had been a ‘mistake honestly made’

Boris Johnson, who voted in favour of the 2003 war, claimed Mr Blair ‘surely needs professional psychiatric help’ for refusing the accept that the conflict was a ‘tragic mistake’.

Former foreign minister Lord Malloch Brown urged Mr Blair to 'stay quiet' because his presence in the debate was driving people to oppose what might be the necessary response.;

Clare Short, who quit Mr Blair's cabinet in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion, said he had been 'absolutely, consistently wrong, wrong, wrong' on the issue, and opposed more strikes.

However Lord Mandeslon leapt to Mr Blair’s defence, insisting the Iraq war was a ‘mistake honestly made’.

The former Labour Cabinet minister insisted Mr Blair had not ‘gone a bit nuts’ for calling for new military action and did not take the ‘country to war on a lie’.
