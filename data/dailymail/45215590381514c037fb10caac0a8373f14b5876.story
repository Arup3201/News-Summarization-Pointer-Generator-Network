Tribute: The Cowboys stadium was a fitting venue for the memorial to Kyle, a proud Texan. Heart-breaking messages, right, from his children aged 8 and 6 were printed onto the ceremony program

'Thank you Chris thank you for loving me, all of me,' she said through tears.

'God worked through you to make me the woman I was supposed to be...You taught me I was okay just the way I am. 

'I stand before you a broken woman 
but I am now and always will be a wife of a man who was a warrior both 
on and off the battlefield.'

The couple's children wrote heart-breaking tributes to him on the memorial program alongside 
pictures of their parents wedding day.

'You are the best dad ever. I never wanted you to die, I miss your heart', one of the messages simply signed by 'Baby Girl' from Kyle's daughter read.

The other signed by 'Bubba' added: 'One of the best things that has happened to me is you. I love you dad. I always will.'

The 38-year-old sniper, who completed
four tours of Iraq and wrote best-seller, the American Sniper, was shot
dead at the Rough Creek Lodge shooting range on February 2 alongside 
his friend Chad Littlefield.

Courage: Taya Kyle made a heartfelt tribute to her husband. Through her tears she told of how much her husband supported her

Eddie Ray Routh has been charged over
the shootings - it is alleged the murdered pair were trying to help the
marine corporal recover from PTSD by taking him out for the day.

Kyle, who also received two Silver Stars, had worked tirelessly to support his fellow comrades since leaving the Navy in 2009.

The man dubbed the 'most lethal 
sniper in U.S. history' after killing 150 was the founder of a 
non-profit supporting veterans providing them with fitness equipment.

He and Littlefield,
who wasn't a military man, regularly took veterans to the shooting range
in order to support them.

The mother of a soldier killed in 
Iraq told the memorial service of how Kyle selflessly offered her the 
proceeds of his best-selling book to support her family.

Debbie Lee, the mother of Marc Lee, 
the first Navy Seal to lose his life in Operation Iraqi Freedom, 
revealed how Kyle made the offer after 'adopting her' into his family.

'Marc's final gift to me was his 
teammates, Chris adopted me and I adopted him. Chris had a huge heart 
full of compassion, love and generosity,' she said.

'He didn't give out of abundance. He
used his platform to acknowledge and remember the sacrifice troops make
for you and me every day.'

The service was punctuated with songs acknowledging Kyle's military service and love for Texas.

His casket draped in a flag sat 
solemnly at the front of the ceremony alongside a framed picture of the 
father-of-two while a video screen showed pictures of his life both in 
the armed forces and at home.

His Navy Seal uniform was also proudly on display.

One friend read a letter from Kyle 
parents. It said: 'The Lord had his hand on you the moment you were born
and you were destined for greatness.

'Son, we are so thankful for having 
you in our life - we are so blessed to have shared in your happiness and
your sorrow...You will live in our hearts forever. We are 
broken-hearted but we will grasp at the strength you have given us. We 
will stand at ease knowing you are watching over us.'

Fellow servicemen also paid tribute to their former colleague but it was his role as father to a 8-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter that made him most proud.

'Under that tough guy exterior was a 
caring and selfless man who would give whatever he had to help someone 
in need,' one friend said.

'He was a proud husband and father. At home 
he wasn't a superhero he was just dad. His love for his family was 
endless.'

Taya Kyle took a moment in her tribute to remind her children how important they were to their father.

'I cherish the look on you dad's face
when you would both come running across the house to take a flying leap
into his arms,' she said.

Selfless: The mother of a soldier killed in Iraq told the memorial service of how Kyle selflessly offered her the proceeds of his best-selling book to support her family.

'I hope you know with all your heart that being your dad 
was the highlight of his life.'

'You made him feel like the best dad in the world...You loved him in a way that was different to any way he has ever known.'

A memorial billboard dedicated to Kyle was visible to the hundreds arriving into Dallas today.

Queues snaked around the Cowboys stadium from 11am for the ceremony.

Sarah Palin was one of those in attendance alongside her husband Todd.

Writing on her Facebook page she said: 'We may never know to what extent Chris kept us free or how many lives he saved by his brave actions in the line of fire. But his fellow warriors know how important he was.

'My son Track couldn’t meet Chris when Todd and I first met him because Track was deployed to Iraq.'

'Then when we got to know Chris even better, our son was deployed in Afghanistan. We’ve met a lot of people in recent years, and Track has been privileged to meet them as well. But he said about Chris, 'Mom, he’s the ONE person in the entire world I would be star-struck to meet. He’s it'.

'God bless this great warrior. Let us keep his wife and children in our prayers, and may we never forget him or his sacrifice.'

Kyle will be buried at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin on Tuesday, Littlefield's funeral was held Friday in Midlothian.
