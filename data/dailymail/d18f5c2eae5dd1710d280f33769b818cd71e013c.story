It may come down to which he values more - his marriage or the future of the Today show.

NBC host Matt Lauer's wife is said to have threatened him with divorce if newsreader Natalie Morales - who he is rumored to have had an affair with - takes Ann Curry's seat when her departure is announced at the end of the week.

Though Savannah Guthrie is the front-runner to replace Ann, it was reported today that Ms Morales said she will quit the Today show if she is bypassed as Lauer's co-anchor again.

A source close to Lauer's wife Annette Roque told the The National Enquirer: 'When
 she heard about Ann getting the boot, the first thing she told Matt was
 that she didn't want him cozying up any closer to Natalie.

'In fact, Annette drew a line in the sand and said if he pushed show bosses to make Natalie his new co-host, she'd divorce him.

'Annette knows Matt is the key to the Today franchise and his bosses will put whoever he wants in the co-host chair.'

Ms Morales has been with Today since 2006 and was 
mentioned as a possible replacement for Meredith Vieira when she 
stepped down from her co-anchor post last year.

A source told the New York Post: 'This will be the second time [Ms Morales] has been passed over for the top job. And she’s not happy.'

A NBC Universal representative had no comment on Ms Curry or her replacement, but said the talk of Ms Morales, 40, being disgruntled was 'totally untrue'.

Lauer, who is said to have signed a $25million deal earlier this year to stay with Today, was accused of having an affair with Ms Morales when they were covering the Winter Olympics in Italy in 2006. 

Though he denied claims, they were enough to prompt a then-pregnant Annette to file for divorce - which she later withdrew.

However two years later, rumors abound that Lauer was the father of one of Ms Morales' children. She is married to Joe Rhodes and the couple have two children together.

Annette lives in the couple's $3.5million house in the Hamptons with their three children. Lauer only sees them at weekends.

Ms Curry, meanwhile, is expected to leave Today imminently, after a year on the job.

During her time as co-anchor, the programme’s ratings have dropped - falling below those of ABC rival Good Morning America at times.

NBC bosses are currently said to be locked in round-the-clock talks over the final details of Ms Curry’s exit.

The network has been negotiating with her over a severance package from her $10million-a-year contract.

Some insiders said the news could come as soon as today.
