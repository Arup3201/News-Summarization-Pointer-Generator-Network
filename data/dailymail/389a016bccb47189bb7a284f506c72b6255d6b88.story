A father who set up a cocaine ring to help funnel money to his fugitive son has been jailed for 11 years.

Robert Blackburn, 64, turned to drug dealing after his son Steven became a wanted man when he fled to Northern Cyprus while on licence for shooting a doorman.

When Blackburn Sr was caught in a safe house with £45,000 in cash and a kilo of cocaine on him, he paraphrased the famous Laurel and Hardy line: 'That's another fine mess I've gotten myself into'.

Blackburn Sr had been freed from a 10-year jail term for heroin supply in 2008, but returned to crime to help his son in the Mediterranean.

Steven shot doorman John Ormston, 26, twice at point blank range outside his home in Throckley, Newcastle, with a double-barrelled shotgun.

Four men, including Steven, were jailed indefinitely for the 2005 attack.

Newcastle Crown Court heard how Steven had recruited the gang to go after Mr Ormston as he was furious when he discovered his former friend had started seeing his mother, Valerie Fothergill, in 2002.

Steven, who was 25 at the time, mistakenly believed that Mr Ormston had acted as a police informer and was responsible for passing on information that led to Blackburn Sr being jailed for the drug-dealing offence.

A judge at Newcastle Crown Court ordered that Steven serve at least six years for the attack, but after his release he fled the country while still on licence.

His father, a joiner with a passion for boats, then began playing a leading role in the cocaine gang.

He helped orchestrate the collection and supply of kilo shipments of the high-purity drug.

Deals were made in a car park behind the Commercial Hotel pub in Winlaton, Gateshead, with Blackburn Sr often arriving in a BMW.

Henchmen moved the cocaine as well as carefully packaged bundles of cash - in £20 notes and up to £60,000 a time - from safe houses to underworld contacts.

However, Blackburn Sr fell under police suspicion in spring last year, Newcastle Crown Court heard.

Northumbria Police launched an operation, codenamed Vegas, putting him and his associates under surveillance and Blackburn Sr was later arrested in a safe house, where he made the Laurel and Hardy quip.

Jeff Mason, prosecuting, said: 'The day of the police strike was August 8 last year, the day arrests and searches took place.

'When Blackburn was arrested, his response was "That's another fine mess I've gotten myself into".'

Blackburn Sr, of Throckley, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine together with more than 10,000 Class C controlled BZP tablets also recovered during the operation.

Jailing him for 11 years, Judge David Wood said only a long prison term could be justified.

He said: 'You are described as playing a leading role and whatever your personal problems, which led to you being involved, the fact is you led a number of other people into much more serious trouble than they have ever been in before.

'These are serious, professional offences and there are aggravating features in your case.'

Six other men arrested during the Vegas investigation were given jail terms totalling 25 years.

Christopher Knox, mitigating, said Blackburn had been a leading man in the conspiracy but that another unknown figure had been above him.

Mr Knox said: 'He became involved because he was helping his son who is a fugitive in northern Cyprus.

'Telephone evidence shows an abundance of calls to his son and there is material about the funding of his son by a co-accused who was a longstanding friend.'

Alan Atkinson, 44, also of Throckley, one of the other six defendants, admitted conspiracy after he tested the purity of the cocaine.

He was jailed for six years.

David French, 58, of Winlaton was a 'warehouser' who used not only his own home but also his elderly mother's house to store drugs and cash, and was jailed for seven years.

Alan Bullock, 49, of Longframlington, Northumberland, acted as a courier, as well as warehouseman.

He was also sentenced to six years behind bars.

Robert Cann, 35, of Stoke-on-Trent moved the drugs to Tyneside from Liverpool and was jailed for two years.

Alan Bell, 33, of South West Denton, Newcastle, laundered at least £145,000 of the gang's drugs cash.

He was a close friend of Steven Blackburn, and was sentenced to two years in prison.

Bell's younger brother James, 29, of West Denton, also admitted laundering some of the gang's cash and was jailed for two years.

Judge Wood told them: 'All of you knew what you were getting into, knew that it involved great risk, but were prepared to put those risks to one side because it also involved profits to all of you.

'The supply was well-organised with drugs being purchased from the North West of this country, being carefully tested, being diluted and being distributed by you throughout, no doubt, the North East of England.

'Large amounts of cash were generated and you all intended to profit. 

'These are therefore, serious offences for which only custody can be justified.'

Another defendant, Brian Carrier, 37, of Kenton, Newcastle, was jailed for three years and eight months after admitting possessing almost 4kg of amphetamine with intent to supply at an earlier hearing.

He had been arrested during a spin-off operation from the Vegas inquiry.
