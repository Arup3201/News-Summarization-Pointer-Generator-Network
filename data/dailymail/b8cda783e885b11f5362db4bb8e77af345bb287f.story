Prince Harry, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie were among the guests today, as Glasses Direct founder Jamie Murray Wells married his long-term girlfriend, barrister Lottie Fry.

The traditional country wedding took place at Dorchester Abbey and saw guests, among them Ben Fogle and his wife Marina, descend on the pretty Oxfordshire village of Dorchester-on-Thames.

But it was the royal contingent that drew the most glances, with Princess Beatrice, once again showing off her increasingly chic sense of style, stealing the show in her £910 pale blue wool coat by French label, Carven.

Harry, 30, was dapper in morning dress, while Princess Eugenie opted for a wool-tweed coat, a pared-down charcoal wool dress, a neat pair of black court shoes and a cream cocktail hat by milliner Juliette Botterill.

But even Beatrice and Eugenie's fashion sense couldn't compete, when Harry turned babysitter for the afternoon, helping out with a pair of angelic little bridesmaids - much to everyone's delight. 

Mr Murray Wells, 31, is a long-standing friend of both Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and advised Kate during her abortive attempt to start a fashion retail business prior to her 2011 marriage.

Now with a turnover in excess of £40m a year, Glasses Direct, which was founded while Mr Murray Wells was still a student, is one of the most successful online businesses in Britain.

As a result, its founder has garnered numerous accolades, among them the CBI's Growing Business gong, the Shell Livewire award and the Daily Mail's Enterprising Young Brit prize.

Mr Murray Wells was also handed a prestigious Queen's Award for his hard work in 2009 and is a volunteer mentor to aspiring entrepreneurs for the Prince's Trust.

Busy time: Harry is fresh from a visit to Lesotho, where he visited projects being run by his HIV/AIDS charity, Sentebale

Former flame: Astrid Harbord, who is allegedly a former girlfriend of Prince Harry, was also among wedding guests

But despite his business success, it is his network of high profile friends that have garnered him the most headlines. Many, including Thomas Inskip, Harry Aubrey Fletcher and Jack Mann were also at the wedding, as was James Meade - another close friend of both William and Harry.

Other guests included Prince William's former girlfriend Olivia Hunt and Astrid Harbord who is allegedly a former flame of Prince Harry's. 

Indeed, so well connected is Mr Murray Wells, he this year made it onto the Tatler List - the society bible's guide to the movers and shakers at the top end of British society.

As well as describing his many business achievements, the newlywed's entry describes him as being a member of the 'Gloucestershire royal posse' and a 'thoroughly nice' person.

'He hunts with the Beauforts,' his entry continues, 'parties with Guy Pelly in Ibiza and has a chauffeur-driven Bentley. Thoroughly nice and a good shot, his favourite jumper is a green V-neck.'

Another person who is partial to a green V-neck is Prince William, who, with his brother, will be among the royals to descend on the Queen's Norfolk estate, Sandringham, next week. 

Harry, who is fresh from a flying visit to Lesotho, and William will be among the group who make their way to the Church of St Mary Magdalene for the traditional Christmas Day service, along with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. 

The Queen has already arrived at the Norfolk estate, which has been owned by the royal family since 1852, and was pictured getting off the train at Kings Lynn station yesterday. 

Stylish sisters: With Beatrice, 26, was Eugenie, 24, who was elegant in a pared-down charcoal dress and cosy-looking tweed coat

Looking good: Princess Beatrice has become increasingly stylish of late and teamed her coat with an on-trend fedora

Home for Christmas: Eugenie, who now lives in New York, was last seen out and about exploring Art Miami with friends

Friends: Ben and Marina Fogle were also at the ceremony which took place in the Oxfordshire village of Dorchester-on-Thames

Well connected: The couple have long counted the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge among their circle of friends

It is also from Sandringham that the Queen's annual Christmas speech is broadcast, usually uncontroversially, although this year looks set to change all that.

Bookies, among them William Hill and Coral, have suspended betting on the Queen revealing abdication plans in this year's speech. Although Buckingham Palace sources have previously said the Queen will never step down, betting was halted following a flurry of surprise wagers.

'Throughout the year there has been major speculation about the Queen's future but the gamble has really caught us by surprise,' said Coral's Nicola McGeady.

'As far as we are concerned there's no smoke without fire when bets like this come through all in succession, so we have decided to be safe rather than sorry and pull the plug on the market.'

A Palace spokesman refused to comment, but did point to the pledges made by the Queen in her 21st birthday speech in 1947. Then, the Queen said: 'I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.'

In her June 1953 Coronation Day speech, she also said: 'I have in sincerity pledged myself to your service, as so many of you are pledged to mine.'

Although it is rare for British monarchs to step aside, with Edward VIII the only monarch to do so, the practice is considerably more common in Europe, where no less than four have stood down in the last two years.

2013 was the busiest year for abdications, with Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, King Albert II of Belgium and Pope Benedict XVI all stepping down.

The following Spring, King Juan-Carlos of Spain, 76, announced plans to step down on the grounds that 'I don't want my son to grow old waiting like Prince Charles'. He formally abdicated on the 18th June, making him the fourth European monarch to do so in less than a year.

Despite the flurry of abdications, the Queen has always stated that she has no plans to do the same, despite being older than all of the four.

One monarch who may yet do so is Denmark's Queen Margrethe, 74, who has been on the Danish throne for 42 years and has an heir, Crown Prince Frederik, of the same age as 46-year-old King Felipe.

However, despite claims in an Australian magazine that an announcement is imminent, sources close to the Danish queen have said she has no intention of stepping down and described the reports as 'all lies'.
