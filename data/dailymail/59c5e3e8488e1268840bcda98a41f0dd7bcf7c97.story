Police are using automatic number plate recognition to track shoplifters in the build up to Christmas

Teams of police carried out the operation in the city's Arnison Shopping Centre, Belmont Retail Park, Dragonville Retail Park and on patrol in the city centre this week.

More than 10,000 covert Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras around the UK photograph and record the registration numbers of 14 million motorists in the UK every day.

The cameras are usually used to monitor the movements of stolen cars and known criminals, but are now being used in the battle against shop thefts.

Durham police Sgt Jim Cowell said: 'The operation has been a success. We had patrol cars in the main shopping areas around the city.'

Officers in north east England have been using the technology this week in a bid to deter theives

He added: 'We deterred potential shoplifters from coming into the area and we are planning on carrying out the operation every day from now on.'

The technology is just one of the ways police forces are trying to crack down on festive season thieves. In Pontypridd, Wales, officers are sending Christmas cards to offenders reminding them they are banned from the town's centre.

Shoplifting and fraud over the Christmas period costs British retailers more than £1billion, as thieves head out to steal presents, food and alcohol.

The crime rose by three per cent last year with the latest figures showing more than 320,000 recorded incidents a year.

Tomorrow has been dubbed 'Black Friday' by some retailers, a day of pre-Christmas sales started in the US but now moving to Britain.
