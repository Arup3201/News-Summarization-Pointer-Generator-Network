This is the moment that 15-year-old Patrick Otema, from Kampala in Uganda, found his voice for the very first time.

Patrick, who was born deaf,  was unable to even express himself to his family and, had things not changed, would have been condemned to a life of silence.

But thanks to a pioneering new programme, he has finally been taught to communicate using sign language.

Patrick's transformation in the class is nothing short of breathtaking as he finally learns how to communicate

Only two per cent of Uganda's population is deaf, but the disability carries huge stigma in the country with the disabled dismissed as 'kasiru', which translates as mentally deficient and useless.

But Patrick has been lucky. His teacher is Raymond Okkelo who is deaf himself - and who is one of the few Ugandans to use sign language.

'In the past I was also like him,' he explains. 'I couldn’t use sign language, the only thing I could do was hide in fear.'

Raymond became deaf as a child after a bout of malaria but six months ago, he travelled to the Ugandan capital Kampala for intensive training in sign language.

Now able to communicate with the outside world, Raymond is determined to change the lives deaf people in sub-Saharan Africa, many of whom have never been taught sign language.

Raymond has set up the first sign-language school in the area and convinced Patrick to attend 

Many of the pupils – aged from nine to 80 – have walked miles to attend Raymond's course 

Raymond, who stars in tonight's episode of Unreported World, has also opened the very first sign language school in the country - which Patrick now attends.

But nothing is as heart-warming as the moment that Patrick finally realises he can communicate, with joy spreading across his face as he grasps the significance of what he has learned.

Patrick's transformation is nothing short of breathtaking. In the space of just a few hours he goes from a hunched over terrified looking boy who can barely make eye contact to beaming and standing confidently in front of the class as they choose his new sign name.

But Patrick won't be the only deaf child to benefit. Buoyed by the success of his first cohort of students, Raymond hopes to take his school on tour and help many more children on the way. 

Unreported World: 15 and Learning to Speak airs on Channel 4 at 7.30pm, 21 November
