A civilian who dressed as a Royal Marine  on Remembrance Sunday told police he was just trying to pay his respects to a friend killed in Afghanistan.

Carwyn Pollard wore a green beret, camouflage,  the Royal Marines dagger insignia and a lance corporal's stripe on November 9 in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.

But the 18-year-old was arrested after a serving soldier spotted he had no army-issue boots, an emblem was displayed wrongly on his arm and he was too young to be a lance corporal.

Suspicions: Great Yarmouth magistrates heard questions were raised about Pollard when he joined veterans at a parade and service to remember Britain's war dead in his home town a few weeks ago

Pollard - whose actions the  soldier described as a 'disgrace' - admitted the offence of wearing a uniform and medal without permission of the Queen, which carries a  fine of up to £1,000 under the 1894 Uniforms Act.

He was also wearing an International Security Assistance Force service medal for Afghanistan, which was not one  the Ministry of Defence had  authorised for use with a uniform.

But he told a court the medal belonged to a friend who had died on active service, and he was just trying to pay tribute.

Great Yarmouth magistrates heard suspicions were raised about Pollard when he joined veterans at a parade and service to remember Britain's war dead in his home town.

Criminal record: Carwyn Pollard, 18, was arrested and charged after he dressed as a Royal Marine at a Remembrance Sunday parade in Norfolk. He told police he was just trying to honour a friend killed in service

Prosecutor Denis King said serving soldier Luke Watson, 23, who was also at the parade, spotted 'various discrepancies' in Pollard's uniform.

Police then arrested him on the seafront, where a second ceremony in memory of Far East prisoners of war was being held after the town's main Remembrance Sunday service.

In interview the unemployed teenager said he had been wearing an old uniform from when he was in the 901 Troop Marine Cadets, based in nearby Winterton.

Mr King added: 'He accepts he had dressed to look like a soldier. The Crown's case is not that this defendant intended to cause offence.

No bragging: Prosecutors accepted he was not trying to pass himself off as a Royal Marine

'The Crown is happy to accept his explanation that he was there to convey his respects, although he did it in an inappropriate way.'

Claire Edgeler, defending, said Pollard had become a cadet in Cambridgeshire before joining the unit in Norfolk.

'He concedes he is no longer in the Cadets,' she said. 'The person who introduced him to the cadets was a serving soldier and that young man died in Afghanistan.

'Mr Pollard was extremely grateful to this young man and wanted to show his respects. He thought the best way was to wear his old cadet's uniform. He accepts he should not have put on the Commando badge.

'The Lance Corporal stripe was from his time in the cadets. He was certainly not attending the Remembrance Day service with the aim of upsetting anybody.

'It was misguided and had he stopped to think, he may have realised that other people may have been offended by his actions.

'There is no suggestion he was trying to impersonate someone from the armed forces. He simply wore a uniform without permission.

'The medal he was wearing was one his friend had been awarded. The friend gave it to him before his last tour and asked him to look after it and said he would retrieve it on his return.

'In hindsight he should have worn it on his right side, not his left, as medals can be worn on the right in memory of someone. In his ignorance he was unaware that those awarded it, should not be wearing it.' 

Mrs Edgeler added Pollard had been subject to 'unpleasant threats' since his arrest was made public and now felt a prisoner in his own home.

Presiding magistrate Carol Doe said she accepted that Pollard did not intend to upset anybody, but 'not surprisingly', his actions had caused offence.

She handed Pollard a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered him to pay £100 in costs and a victim surcharge. 

She also ordered the destruction of his uniform, apart from the medal. 

Speaking after the case, Pollard declined to identify the friend who he said had been awarded the medal.

Magistrates handed Pollard a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered him to pay £100 in costs and a victim surcharge. They also ordered the destruction of his uniform, apart from the medal

Keith Savage, a member of staff at the independent 901 Troop Marine Cadets, said after the hearing that Pollard had only been in the unit for six to eight weeks last year before being discharged for alleged dishonesty.

He denied Pollard's claim to police that he had been awarded the green beret for completing a course with the unit, and said he appeared to have added insignia to his uniform

Mr Savage said: 'We do not use the Commando insignia and we certainly never issue a green beret. They are a sacred thing and are only ever issued to people who go through hell on the Commando training course.'

Paul Williams, 74, the chairman of Great Yarmouth branch of the Royal British Legion and standard bearer at the parade, declined to comment on the furore.

'The incident happened out of my sight and did not disturb the overall dignity of the occasion,' he said.
