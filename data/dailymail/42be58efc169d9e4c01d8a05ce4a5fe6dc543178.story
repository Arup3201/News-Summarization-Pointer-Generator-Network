Warning: Rachel Reeves fears traditional voters are deserting Labour

Labour’s revolt over Ed Miliband’s leadership deepened last night after a member of his Shadow Cabinet declared the party was being deserted by its traditional supporters.

Rachel Reeves – who has been tipped as a future leader of the party – became the first frontbencher to break ranks since Labour’s recent run of  poor election results.

She warned Mr Miliband that his blue-collar supporters were abandoning the party for Ukip because Labour was taking them ‘for granted’.

The party was beaten into second place by Ukip in last month’s European elections.

On top of that it made only limited gains in the local council poll and came a distant third in last Thursday’s Newark by-election.

Mr Miliband’s personal ratings have also remained persistently dire, leading many experts to question his credentials as a plausible Prime Minister.

Ms Reeves, the Shadow Work  and Pensions Secretary, told a gathering of senior Labour figures on the day of the Newark poll that after several weeks ‘on the doorstep’ she had discovered that the party’s vote was plummeting in seats ‘that were previously safe’.

She said: ‘Traditional voters, who perhaps at times we took for granted but had nowhere else to go, are now being offered an alternative by Ukip.

‘Our voters, if I can still call them that, see Ukip [as] a party who are offering a vision and a hope that things can be better.

‘They hear something from that party that resonates with them and with their fears for the future and that’s something very real that we have to contend with and it’s something real that  we have to contend with for  two reasons.

‘First of all, for purely electoral reasons, we have to hold on and build that coalition again of our traditional voters.

‘The Labour party came into existence to give a voice for ordinary working people. What I saw... were middle class, public sector, well-educated young graduates voting Labour, but the people who the Labour Party was set up to help, abandoning us.’

Ms Reeves, who worked as a Bank of England economist before being selected for Leeds West at the 2010 election on an all-women shortlist, concluded: ‘Our very raison d’etre will be threatened if the working people, who the Labour Party have got to be there for, and got to be a voice for, start to drift away because they don’t see us as the answer.’

She made her remarks at a conference branded ‘One Nation’  – the political slogan adopted by Mr Miliband – held at Queen Mary University of London, alongside other senior Labour figures including policy co-ordinator Jon Cruddas and Shadow Health Minister Luciana Berger.

Last week seven rebel Labour MPs, including Frank Field, Kate Hoey and John Mann, published an open letter to Mr Miliband which argued that the unrestricted entry of EU citizens from eastern  Europe since 2004 was hurting  the ‘very communities that the Labour Party was founded  to represent’.

The MPs argued that concern with immigration had become an important priority for a large proportion of working-class and middle-class voters.

They added: ‘While the benefits of mass migration have been served in abundance to many wealthy people, who are in a position to  take advantage of cheap labour,  we believe that the lack of affordable housing, school places, hospital capacity and transport infrastructure to accommodate  this influx of people means that poorer people’s living standards have been squeezed.’

Last night a spokesman for  Ms Reeves said: ‘The Labour Party is building support across Britain with our plans to freeze energy bills, guarantee patients a GP appointment within 48 hours and reform our banking system.’
