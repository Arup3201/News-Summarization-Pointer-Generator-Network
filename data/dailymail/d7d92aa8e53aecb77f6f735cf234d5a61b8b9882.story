Internet trolls who sent vile messages to the Queen after she posted her first tweet are Scottish Nationalists, it has emerged.

Her Majesty sent her historic message on Twitter on Friday to open an exhibition at the Science Museum, but then received a volley of online abuse.

The Mail on Sunday has identified a number of the trolls as supporters of Scottish independence.

The Queen sends her historic tweet from the London's Science Museum which triggered the online attacks

One user, writing under the name Grant Macdonald, posted: ‘**** off, you’re an embarrassment.’

The user, who claims to be a Cambridge University graduate and whose profile photo is an image of the ‘Yes’ campaign’s slogan, added: ‘I never knew our monarchy had a twitter account I could abuse, complete with flags plastered all over.’

Another, writing under the name JonathanBryce45%, tweeted: ‘YOU CAN GET TO **** AS WELL PAL!!!’

He describes himself on the social network as ‘proud to be one of the 45%’, a reference to the share of the Yes vote in the Scottish referendum.

He also wrote: ‘What world do some of these ****holes who replied to @BritishMonarchy live in? Her & her sponging clan are needing to get to **** pronto too.’

Some of the more colurful comments which flowed in after the Queen sent her first message into cyberspace

Last week The Mail on Sunday reported the Government’s plan to raise jail sentences for trolls from six months to two years.

Chairman of the British Monarchist Society Thomas Mace Archer-Mills said: ‘The monarchy has a history of using technology to keep the institution relevant, which should be applauded. I am pleased new laws are being brought in to target trolls.’

Last night a source at YesScotland told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Throughout our campaign we called on everyone to be treated with respect and therefore condemn these messages.’
