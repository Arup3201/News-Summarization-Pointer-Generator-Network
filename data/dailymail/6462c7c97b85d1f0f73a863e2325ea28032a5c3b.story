Arsene Wenger admitted  on Thursday that Arsenal missed out on signing 'one more player' during the summer — something the Gunners boss will try to rectify in January.

The Gunners are currently facing a severe injury crisis with nine players unavailable for Saturday's Premier League clash against Hull.

But it is the defence that is most stretched with Laurent Koscielny (achilles), Mathieu Debuchy (ankle) and Calum Chambers (suspended) all missing.

Arsene Wenger has vowed to strengthen his squad after missing out on 'one more player' in the summer

Speaking at Arsenal's Annual General Meeting, Wenger said: ‘I agree we could have bought one more player but we didn’t find one.

‘But we will try in January to rectify that because we are a bit short because of the injuries we've had.’

Here Sportsmail highlights seven of the defenders on Arsenal's scouting list.

Matija Nastasic

Manchester City will sell the 21-year-old Serb and have strong interest from Juventus and Inter Milan but Arsenal have the ready cash. Valued at £12m, they may sell for less.

Chances: 4/5

Matija Nastasic has fallen out of favour at Manchester City and could be available for less than £12million

Virgil  van Dijk

Arsenal looked into the prospect of signing Van Dijk, 23, on transfer deadline day but couldn't get a deal over the line. The Celtic defender would fetch a fee of around £7m

Chances: 4/5 

Arsenal attempted to sign Virgil van Dijk on transfer deadline day but could not get a deal over the line

Stephane Sparagna

Age: 19

Marseille defender can also play in defensive midfield which is ideal for Wenger’s plans. His contract runs out in December and he is available for nominal compensation should he leave.

Chances: 3/5

Stephane Sparagna can play also as a defensive midfielder and his versatility could appeal to Arsene Wenger

Ron Vlaar

Age: 29

Aston Villa defender has yet to agree to a new contract and is free in the summer. Tottenham, Southampton and Manchester United are among others monitoring his situation.

Chances: 3/5

Ron Vlaar has been linked several clubs in recent weeks, including Tottenham and Manchester United

Winston Reid

Age: 26

West Ham are hoping to open contract talks next week but the Kiwi looks set to see out his contract and leave on a free unless a deal can be struck. Not top of Arsenal list but an option.

Chances: 2/5

Winston Reid is out of contract in the summer and is an option for Arsenal, although he is not first choice

Liam Moore

Age: 21

Leicester defender has been on Arsenal’s radar since he was a teenager and club scouts watched him last week playing for England Under 21. May not yet be at the club's desired level.

Chances: 1/5

Leicester's Liam Moore, 21, has been on Arsenal's radar since he was a teenager

Sokratis Papastathopoulos

Age: 26

Dortmund want £17m for the Greece international and are unlikely to sell while in the Champions League. The same applies to their other defenders until next summer.

Chances: 1/5

Sokratis Papastathopoulos is the most expensive option and would depend on Dortmund's willingness to sell
