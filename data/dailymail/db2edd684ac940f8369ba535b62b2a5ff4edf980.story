The hustle and bustle of the NBA season will take a backseat on Friday for the razzmatazz of All-Star weekend.

This year's event will take place in New York with history to be made at the showcase event as brothers Marc and Pau Gasol will be the first pair of siblings to be voted in as All-Star starters.

Ahead of the showpiece event at New York Knicks' Madison Square Garden on Sunday, Bleacher report have whetted the appetite by comparing this year's crop of All-Star selections with great's from the past.

2015 All-Star pick: Kobe Bryant; NBA Legend: Michael Jordan

Position: Shooting guard

These two are widely regarded as the greatest players of their generation and in the upper echelons of the sport's history.

Michael Jordan became the face of the Chicago Bulls during the 1990s - inspiring them to a double hat-trick of NBA titles in two separate spells.

Kobe Bryant has five championship titles to his name as well and is a 17-time All-Star. Unfortunately a recent torn rotator cuff injury has curtailed the Los Angeles Lakers star from appearing in the Big Apple though.

The pair did come across each other on the court during the twilight of Jordan's career as Bryant was making a name for himself as a rookie.

A young Bryant imitated his role-model Jordan's action on the court - with the similarities between the two widely evident.

Even though the comparisons still remain, the pair are both seen as two legendary figures of basketball and rightly so.

2015 All-Star pick: Carmelo Anthony; NBA Legend: Bernard King

Position: Small forward 

When you think of the New York Knicks, Bernard King and Carmelo Anthony are two standout players who have illuminated the franchise during it's famous history.

King, during the 1980s, was a devastating runner on the fast break and a tremendous scorer - leading the 1984/85 season with an average of 32.9 points a game.

Anthony may not be renowned for his ability on the fast break, but his ability to score from anywhere on the court makes him one of the deadliest NBA shooters around today 

Although King preferred to shoot from around the baseline and Anthony frequently doing so from the wings, the pair both have iconic pull-up shots that define their era.

King's career was curtailed by a destabilising knee injury, while Anthony too is currently struggling with health issues that could end his season with the modern day Knicks.

With the All-Star weekend on home court though, the 30-year-old will be desperate to put on a show.

2015 All-Star pick: LeBron James; NBA Legend: Oscar Robertson

Position: Small forward (James), Guard (Robertson) 

LeBron James' nickname is 'the King' and it's hard to dispute that.

At the age of 30 he's a two-time NBA champion, a four-time MVP winner and a 11-time All-Star pick.

The Cleveland Cavaliers star is a mixture of NBA legends Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and Karl Malone as the small forward continues to transcend the sport.

James' undeniable talents in a 6ft 5in, 200-plus lbs frame harks to memories of Oscar Robertson in his pomp - who could also score, assist and rebound.

The former Cincinnati Royals (now Sacramento Kings) and Milwaukee Bucks star had similar physical characteristics as James as well as the same enduring athleticism.

2015 All-Star pick: Steph Curry, NBA Legend: Pete Maravich

Position: Point guard

'Steph Curry with the shot,' is a popular present lyric from hip hop star Drake's song 0 to 100 and the point guard has had the whole of the NBA singing to his tune after a stellar season so far with the Golden State Warriors.

The 26-year-old is a leading MVP contender after guiding the Warriors to the top of the Western Conference standings.

Curry is averaging 23.6 points a game with 7.9 assists under rookie coach Steve Kerr. 

But it's not just the point guard's impressive statistics that draw him comparisons to Pete Maravich.

Curry's ball-handling abilities are reminiscent of Maravich's during the 1970's for primarily the Atlanta Hawks and the New Orleans (now Utah) Jazz.

From the criss-cross dribbles and pull-ups - Curry is the modern day 'Pistol Pete.'
