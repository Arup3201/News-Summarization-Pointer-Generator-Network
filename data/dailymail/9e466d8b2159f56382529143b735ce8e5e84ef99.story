Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker has said he could earn more if he left the BBC

Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker has said he could earn more money if he left the BBC.

The former England striker said he was unable to justify his wage to 'ordinary people doing proper jobs' and said he was open to criticism because his wage came from the licence fee.

The BBC is believed to pay Lineker £1.5m a year, according to reports, although he has previously said it is not as high as has been reported.

In an interview with The Times, Lineker, who played for Leicester City, Everton, Barcelona and Spurs, described estimates of his overall wealth as 'completely ridiculous'.

He said facing suggestions he earned too much money was the 'downside' of his role at the corporation.

He said: 'I could earn more elsewhere, but because it's the licence fee you are open to criticism.'

He went on to say: 'Do I deserve it? Probably not - but who would turn it down?'

According to The Telegraph, Lineker's wage has never been publicly disclosed, but reports this year suggested he faced a cut of £500,000.

The former footballer was previously believed to be on a salary of £2million a year.

Lineker also holds a contract with Arabic TV network Al Jazeera — for whom he presents the station's Champions League coverage — and has a long-running deal with Walkers crisps.

Lineker has recently featured in the programme Who Do You Think You Are? which saw him learn about two of his distant relatives, law writer Tom Billingham and 'poacher' James Pratt.

The programme saw the presenter discover his great, great, great grandfather Mr Pratt was jailed in the 1800s for poaching birds to feed his eight children.

Mr Pratt served his time in jail in Leicester which included six months for stealing chickens.

Last month David Cameron warned huge pay-offs to senior bosses had jeopardised public support for the BBC.

Annual accounts released in July revealed the corporation handed its top directors £4.1million in 12 months. The cost of the executive board rose by 63 per cent, boosted by golden goodbyes of nearly £1.5million.

The Prime Minister said: ‘The BBC has to be very careful with the money that it spends. The BBC is in a unique position because it has the licence fee.

‘I support the licence fee but going with the licence fee is the responsibility to spend that money wisely and I think it’s quite clear the BBC pay-offs have been too high and there hasn’t been enough rigour in this whole process.

‘The BBC has strong public support but they won’t keep that support unless they spend the money wisely.’
