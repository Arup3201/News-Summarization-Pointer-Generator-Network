Roger Federer is still going strong at 33 but after the pulverising he got from Milos Raonic on Friday he might be thinking fonder thoughts of the time when he can put his feet up.

The big Canadian pounded down 22 aces that helped knock Federer out of the Paris Masters 7-6 7-5 and potentially put a severe dent in the great Swiss’ s designs on regaining the world number one spot at the end of the season.

Federer was left hoping that Andy Murray would do him a favour by knocking Novak Djokovic out of the quarter final as the old rivals duelled to join Raonic in the semi-finals along with Tomas Berdych.

1 Novak Djokovic 9190 - qualified 

2 Roger Federer 8700 - qualified 

3 Rafael Nadal* 6835 - withdrew 

4 Stan Wawrinka 4895 - qualified

5 Andy Murray 4475 - qualified 

6 Tomas Berdych 4465 - qualified 

7 Kei Nishikori 4445 

8 Milos Raonic 4200 

9 Marin Cilic 4150 - qualified (as US Open champion)

The Czech had earlier guaranteed his place in the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals and, if Federer had held true to the formbook and won his match, the whole field would have been automatically decided with Kei Nishikori and David Ferrer completing the eight-man field at the 02 Arena.

The only person who could stop them was Raonic, who has slipped down the ‘Race For London’ due to a late season slump that suggested he would be doing nothing more than turning up as the on-site first reserve at the Finals.

Yet he made a nonsense of recent results by hitting Federer off the court with an excellent performance which, while rooted in his God-given serving ability, was backed up by more solid groundstroking than usual.

Federer can still attain the world number one slot regardless of any outcome in Paris, and has to hope that his legs can carry him through to the end of the season.

He might have been a little sluggish as, like many others players, weariness is setting in at this stage of the year, but even had he been at his most sprightly he would have struggled against the bombs being delivered by the 6’ 5” slugger from Toronto.

Raonic played an outstanding tiebreak and looked safe on serve until 4-5 in the second, when Federer created a set point which was saved by an ace. There are times these days when the Swiss gets over-exasperated when things are not going his way, and he looked mighty displeased by how helpless he was against against his opponent’s golden arm.

In the next game the Canadian broke with a piercing backhand pass and then served it out to keep his ambitions of a first appearance at the 02 Arena alive.

Federer has the consolation of a weekend off to gather himself for both London and the Davis Cup final against France in Lille that comes the weekend after that, but he wanted to keep the pressure up on Djokovic. Losing is not something he has been familiar with of late, going undefeated since the US Open with a run of fourteen consecutive victories that has carried him to the brink of yet another remarkable career achievement. 

Raonic will play Tomas Berdych in the semi-finals as he looks to end the year on a high

Berdych became the sixth man to qualify (or seventh if you include the absent Rafael Nadal) and it will be the fifth consecutive time he has finished the season in the world’s top eight.

He did so by beating Kevin Anderson 6-7 6-4 6-4, this being the twelfth consecutive time he has beaten the towering South African, who concluded his most successful season on a note of gut-wrenching disappointment.

Berdych, with his easy power of both flanks, will consider himself to be among those most unlucky to have been around in the era of the so-called Big Four to which Murray now seeks re-entry.

Although his mental power has never matched the physical prowess of his game, had he been born ten years it is very possible that he would have won a Grand Slam by now, rather than just having reached a solitary Wimbledon final.
