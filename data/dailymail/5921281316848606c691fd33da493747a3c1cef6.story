Justice minister Helen Grant is claiming £1,666.67 per month for a flat in London, even though she lives within commuting distance of the capital

A Government minister who lives only 19 miles from the Commons is claiming taxpayers money to fund a second home in London.

Justice minister Helen Grant today defended the arrangement in which she lives in a £1.8million home in Reigate, Surrey – outside her Maidstone constituency- but also rents a flat on the bank of the Thames.

She is allowed to claim expenses on the flat - near the MI6 building in Vauxhall - because her constituency is considered too far to commute from the capital.

But Reigate, where she lives, is not far enough from London for the constituency MP - Tory Crispin Blunt - to make similar expenses claims.

Mrs Grant’s expense claims will be revealed in a documentary tonight, which will also show how more MPs than first thought are claiming rent on a second home while letting out a property they own nearby.

Last month it emerged 27 MPs were renting out homes they owned while claiming expenses on a different property.

But Channel 4’s Despatches will say at least 32 MPs have entered into the same arrangement, which is allowed under new rules imposed after the expenses scandal which banned claiming for mortgages from the end of August.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority will today publish details of the landlords of 300 MPs, against the wishes of Commons speaker John Bercow. At least four MPs are thought to be renting homes to each other.

Some have suggested the complex arrangements are the unintended consequences of the system put in place after widespread abuse of the expenses system was uncovered in the last parliament.

As part of the reforms, only MPs who have constituencies outside London can claim second home expenses.

But the rules do not state that the MP has to live in their own constituency.

Mrs Grant, who was promoted to the Ministry of Justice in the September reshuffle, lives in Reigate which is considered too close to London to have a second home in the capital.

But because she is MP for Maidstone she is claiming £1,666.67 per month - the maximum allowed within the rules, which caps rental claims at £20,000 per year. Mrs Grant has filed claims for rent since March this year.

A spokeswoman for Mrs Grant said today: ‘Mrs Grant's constituency has been deemed by IPSA to be a non-London constituency and she is therefore fully entitled to use her rental accommodation allowance either in London or in the constituency.

‘She has a base in her constituency at her mother's property, where her son also lives, so she sees no need to rent a further property there.

‘The focus of her time and responsibility has always been Maidstone and the Weald.’

But campaigners accused Mrs Grant of breaking the spirit of the rules designed to protect taxpayers’ money.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘Helen Grant's arrangements certainly appear to be against the spirit of the rules. The taxpayer-funded allowance for a second home is meant to be there for MPs living in a constituency home from which they cannot reasonably commute to Westminster on a daily basis.

‘Most people would expect that by choosing to remain living in her Surrey home - which is a commutable distance from London - Mrs Grant would have made herself ineligible to make these claims. This is a loophole in the rules which ought to be closed.

However, IPSA insisted the arrangement was in order. A spokesman said: ‘We set the rules up based on the constituency the MP represents. We provide support for one of those locations to help with renting a flat.

‘Ultimately it comes down to the MP's judgment about what they need to claim for. We don't check to see what private assets an MP has.’
