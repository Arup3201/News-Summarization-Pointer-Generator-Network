Hundreds of people have been evacuated from tourist boats on the River Thames after a passenger ferry collided with a barge carrying rubbish near the iconic OXO Tower.

A number of people on board the City Cruises vessel were hurt - including at least three with neck injuries - following the crash at around 2.15pm opposite the Oxo Tower, near Blackfriars Bridge, in central London.

The casualties included two teenager boys and three women aged in their 70s, 50s and 30s but none had to be taken to hospital.

One boy 
was treated for a graze to his leg and another for shock, the women aged
 in their 70s and 30s were treated for neck pains and a woman in her 50s
 suffered a knee injury.

The Millennium Time has a capacity of 340 and is one of a fleet operated by City Cruises.

A
 fleet of ambulances were lined up on South Bank ready to take 
casualties to hospital and several River Police vessels were at the 
scene.

The City Cruises vessel was visibly damaged but did not appear to be sinking.

Some
 of the passengers on board the stricken passenger ferry were being 
transferred to other boats as a full-scale rescue operation swung into 
action.

A crew member of a Thames pleasure cruiser giving tourists a running commentary of the sights is said to have been desperately waving his arms and shouted 'turn turn' before a rubbish barge rammed into it.

Couple Sandra Gonzalez and Andres Ramirez were on the top deck of the boat with their two children aged nine and 13.

Ms Gonzalez said: 'One second we were just sailing down the river from Westminster, looking at all the famous buildings and next we saw this boat heading straight for us, it was so scary.

'The guide was telling us about the places along the Thames, but because he was looking at us he didn't see the other boat until someone shouted.

'He started calling to the other boat and waving his arms, he was shouting 'turn turn'.

'Our boat rocked hard to the left and people were screaming, we thought we were all going to get really hurt or something worse.

'The boat managed to turn enough so we didn't hit each other head on, but because it was towing the barges they smashed into the front of ours.

'We all held on to our seats, but thank god the impact was not too hard.'

The family from Bogata in Columbia, were spending the first day of their holiday sightseeing after arriving in London yesterday.

Mr Ramirez said: 'We were sat just four seats from the front on the top, but it was much worse for the people sat right below us.

'It's sunny so there were mostly people on top, but the people on the bottom deck got covered in glass when the windows were smashed in.

'Some people looked like they were hurt badly, they were bleeding.

'It was lucky it hit the side, if not the injuries would have been much worse.'

Ms Gonzalez added: 'We wanted to go to Greenwich - we'll take the tube next time instead.'

boats..'

While
 Author Oliver Payne tweeted: 'Boat crash on the Thames near OXO Tower.

'A lot of people were shaken and had cuts and bruises. We counted nine minor injury casualties.

'Considering the damage they were all very lucky. I feel lucky that there were not any major casualties to deal with.'

Mr King said there were 362 passengers on board at the time.

A
 spokeswoman for City Cruises said: 'Today at 14:25 the Millennium Time -
 part of City Cruises' sightseeing fleet - made contact with a 
commercial vessel while sailing by Coin Street on the River Thames.

'Seven minor injuries have been reported, none of whom were hospitalised.

'All
 other passengers were guided off the boat promptly by City Cruises, who
 continue to do everything they can to support the authorities and those
 involved in the incident.

It is believed there are a small number of people with minor injuries including cuts and whiplash

'Investigations are ongoing and more information will follow pending its conclusion.

'The Millennium Time will return to Cherry Garden Pier for repair and all other City Cruises services are running as usual.'

Safety
 on the Thames was overhauled in the wake of the Marchioness disaster in
 1989, which saw 51 people die when the pleasure cruiser hit a dredger.

Scotland Yard said today that neither boat was at risk of sinking after the collision and that it was too early to speculate on the cause of the crash.

A
 Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Police were called to the Thames, near 
the Oxo Tower, at 2.15pm today following reports of a passenger ferry 
and cargo boat in collision.

'The
 Metropolitan Police's Marine Support Unit, Coastguard, London Fire 
Brigade and London Ambulance Service are all in attendance and are 
currently in the process of taking those on board the ships to shore.

'At this stage there are believed to be a small number of people with minor injuries including cuts and whiplash.

'Nobody from either vessel entered the water following the collision, and neither boat is believed to be at risk of sinking.'

Police said it was 'too early' to speculate what caused the collision.

City Cruises, that was set up in 1985 
and has a fleet of 19 boats, carries more than two million passengers 
each year on sightseeing, entertainment and private charter trips.

Police said it was 'too early' to speculate what caused the passenger ferry to crash with the barge

A London Ambulance service spokesman added: 'We were called to a boat collision on the Thames near South Bank at 2.20pm.Â 

'We treated three patients for neck pain at the scene.

'Another
 patient treated for minor injury. We sent two ambulances, a duty 
officer and hazardous area response team to the scene.'

The London Fire Brigade also sent its boat to the scene of the crash.

A spokeswoman said: 'The fire boat has been called to reports of a collision between two boats on the Thames near Waterloo Bridge.

'Firefighters are assisting the police and the RNLI at the scene.'

Safety regulations on the River Thames have been tightened since the Marchioness tragedy which claimed 51 lives a quarter of a century ago.

It was that August 1989 disaster, when the pleasure cruiser Marchioness, full of partygoers, collided at night with the dredger Bowbelle and sank in the Thames near Southwark, that prompted an urgent look at the dangers on Britain's most-famous river.

For example, at the time of the sinking there was no Royal National Lifeboat Institute (RNLI) services on the Thames.

Now there are four - at Tower in the heart of the city, at Chiswick in west London, at Gravesend to the east of the capital and Teddington in south west London.

The RNLI provides a search-and-rescue service to any point within the tidal reaches of the River Thames between Canvey Island in the east to Teddington.

All four stations are all permanently manned, this is because RNLI Lifeboat crews on the Thames are required to be afloat within 90 seconds of being notified of an incident.

Figures for 2013 showed that lifeboat crews rescued 372 people from the Thames, It is estimated that 25 of those saved would have died without the help of the RNLI.

The charity's annual report also revealed that Tower station, which is next to Waterloo Bridge, was the busiest in the UK and Ireland in 2013. Its crews were called out 492 times, rescued 128 people and saved 19 lives.

Tower, Chiswick and Teddington lifeboat stations were launched for 733 shouts throughout the year.However, as the Marchioness proved, the key to safety on the Thames and other rivers, is vigilance.

The inquiry into the 1989 disaster concluded that the tragedy happened because neither vessel had a proper lookout.
