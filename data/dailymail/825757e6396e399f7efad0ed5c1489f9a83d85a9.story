Jailed: Wales striker Ched Evans was jailed on Friday for five years

The Professional Footballer's Association has been forced to defend its decision to include convicted rapist Ched Evans in their League One Team of the Year.

The players' union chief executive Gordon Taylor admitted there had been discussions about withdrawing the Sheffield United striker before Sunday's awards ceremony, in view of the fact that the ballot papers had been returned before Evans was jailed for five years for the rape of a 19-year-old girl.

Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, said: 'That was a football judgement by his fellow professionals, it was not a moral judgement and in no way does the PFA condone the offence for which he was convicted.

'If he had been removed from the team it would have created more of a storm and would have been manipulating the vote.

'Votes are cast on footballing ability, obviously everyone is quite disturbed about the conviction and whether that would have changed the vote we just don't know.'

Wales striker Evans, who hit 35 goals in 42 appearances in all competitions for the Blades, has indicated that he wants to appeal against the conviction.

Sheffield United have launched an internal inquiry into comments made on Twitter by reserve-team player Connor Brown following Evans' prison sentence last week after being found guilty of rape.

Brown, 19, responded to the news of Evans' five-year prison sentence by tweeting his support for his team-mate.

A statement released on the club's official website read: 'Sheffield 
United confirmed today that an internal investigation is under way into 
social media comments made by reserve-team player Connor Brown following
the verdict in the Ched Evans trial.

Gordon Taylor, Chief of the Professional Footballers Association, said 
Evans' inclusion had been a 'footballing judgement' not a moral one

'The club is aware of a very serious matter regarding comments made 
through the Twitter account of one of its players. As a result we have 
launched an inquiry.'

A complaint about the comments was made to North Wales Police by a leading rape charity.

Evans was jailed at Caernarfon Crown Court on Friday after being found 
guilty of raping the woman who was 'too drunk to consent'.

A spokeswoman for North Wales Police said: 'We are aware of some 
comments made on social media sites and we are collating all relevant 
information.'

Evans admitted having sex with the victim, then aged 19, at a hotel in north Wales last May.

In her evidence, the woman said she has no memory of the incident and 
the prosecution argued she was too drunk to consent to sexual 
intercourse.

Evans' co-accused, Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, 23, who also 
admitted having sex with the victim, was found not guilty of the same 
charge.
