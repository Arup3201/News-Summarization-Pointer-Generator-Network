Unwelcome surprise: Police in Sweden reportedly busted two prostitutes using an apartment they rented from two women through online site Airbnb as a brothel (file picture posed by model)

Two women who rented out their apartment through the online service Airbnb returned to discover it had been used by prostitutes as a temporary brothel, it emerged today.

They arrived back after a month-long vacation to find a letter from police saying they had busted the sex workers in the act after trailing them to the property.

Inside, the owners found pubic hair, a plastic bag of used condoms and other detritus from a makeshift brothel set up by their guests, according to reports.

They had rented their flat in Stockholm, Sweden, via Airbnb, which matches people seeking short-term accommodations with those with rooms to let out.

One of the homeowners said the women had looked 'very high class, with business suits'.

'It was strange that they would rent an apartment when they clearly could afford a hotel,' she told www.kernelmag.com.

'We feel uneasy about being in our own apartment after this.'

It is believed from sources that the apartment owners do not want to pursue legal action, but are looking for compensation from Airbnb.

The prostitute bust, which came to light at the weekend, is the latest in a number of alleged horror stories involving apartments rented through Airbnb.

Running jokes in the U.S. involve meth addicts with stolen identities trashing homes and similar accusations are said to have emerged in London and eastern Europe.

According to The Kernel, some commentators believe the lack of regulation around private rentals could even be encouraging organised crime.

Since its launch in 2008 and subsequent steady growth, Airbnb has raised $120million in venture capital funding from investors such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and actor Ashton Kutcher.

In a statement, the company said: 'We're appalled to hear about this and we will work with the local authorities to investigate the situation.

'Weâ€™re also providing ongoing support to the host. While this situation is being investigated, we can't comment further.'
