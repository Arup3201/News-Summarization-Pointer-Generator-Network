Italy’s star midfielder is running scared at the prospect of facing England at the World Cup in Brazil and has sought solace with the team priest.

Andrea Pirlo has had crisis meetings with squad pastor Don Massimiliano Gabricci amid concerns over his ability to perform on Saturday.

He has bared his soul over the break-up of his marriage with Deborah Roversi – after getting close to blonde Valentina Baldini, who he met at his golf club.

The midfield pass-master fears his tangled private life could have an impact on his performances on the pitch.

Pirlo, 35, terrorised England in the Euro 2012 Championships and any crisis of confidence could be good news for Roy Hodgson's men ahead of their World Cup opener on Saturday night in Manaus.

At training camp in Florence, Pirlo and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who has recently separated from model wife Alena Seredova, were Don Massimiliano’s top priorities.

He also attempted to soothe the anxieties of forward Alessio Cerci, who wept on the pitch after missing a crucial penalty in the final match of the Serie A season.

He told Italian TV Rai Sport: 'I consoled Cerci on Sunday evening. He is an emotional and sensitive guy, he should not feel ashamed of his mistake.

'This is life, this is football. It’s a pity, but he will do great things at the World Cup.'

The team's spiritual father, a close friend of coach Cesare Prandelli, officiated at a special team mass and held a ceremony of blessing for the squad before they left for Brazil.

'I am convinced that Italy will have a great World Cup,' the chaplain said.

'I'm like part of the team. I always come
 to the training camp in Florence. I try and give them advice. I tell 
them to treat the experience as a huge adventure. They have a lot on 
their shoulders and they need to be serene and happy.'

He added: 'They're all good guys, better than some of my parishioners.'

The chaplain did not accompany the team to Brazil but is providing spiritual assistance by text message.

Pirlo has been married to Roversi for thirteen years and the pair have two children together. The divorce settlement will reportedly cost Pirlo 55,000 Euro a month.

Buffon announced his separation from his former Miss Czech Republic wife during training camp.
