By the look of this Test, both sides are going to have to unearth a formula from somewhere that allows them to take 20 wickets. England came close, and I think they’ll take more out of the match than India.

But on this kind of surface, and with the balance both teams have gone for, stalemate was always the likeliest outcome.

Cricket deserves a better surface than this. More than grass, England would have craved pace and carry, both because it allows batsmen to play their shots and because the nicks carry to the slips.

Bowled over: England captain Alastair Cook (C) celebrates taking a rare wicket

It can only be a reflection of how perilous some counties’ finances must be if they’re so desperate to ensure a fifth day that they come up with something like this.

And when both sides are packing their teams with batsmen, you’re struggling to look beyond a draw. Those were the tactics I expected from India. They lost here 4-0 three years ago and they haven’t won an away Test since 2011.

Duncan Fletcher always liked to fill his England side with batsmen and he wanted to make sure India weren’t going to Lord’s 1-0 down.

Saving grace: Stuart Binny's runs got India out of trouble at Trent Bridge

But India may have got their selection wrong. Even though Stuart Binny scored some runs to get them out of trouble on Sunday, they may have looked at the history of Trent Bridge and picked a side in expectation of some swing. Yet the pitch was more suited to a second spinner and Ravichandran Ashwin might have been a more logical option.

I don’t think Lord’s will spin big, so India will need something better from Mohammed Shami if they’re going to take 20 wickets — especially if Ben Stokes is batting as low as No 8.

Equally, England will have to find a way to knock over India more quickly.

Papering over the cracks: Joe Root and James Anderson's late stand masked England's deficiencies

When Liam Plunkett bowled MS Dhoni, they had a sniff, but after that it was pretty slow going.  Overall, I thought they bowled pretty well, apart from operating with too many 7-2 off-side fields in India’s first innings — I felt they should have bowled straighter.

Alastair Cook’s captaincy was fine, if a little reactive in the second innings.

But they must find a way to stop these batting collapses. The last-wicket stand between Joe Root and Jimmy Anderson was very enjoyable, but it masked the fact that, on the plumbest of pitches, England had lost six wickets from a position of strength.
