It is one of the landmark events in a 
teenage girl's life - so it comes as no surprise that they want to pull out all the stops to make sure they 
get noticed at the prom.

From glitzy 
new dresses and accessories to expensive beauty treatments, teenage 
girls spend hundreds of pounds glamming up.

But according to the latest research, for the first time ever, guys are spending nearly as much as girls on getting themselves ready for their big night.

And one high street retailer has been reaping the rewards.

Debenhams’ have seen their dinner suits selling 60 per cent more than they were this time last year as well as formal shirts and shoes flying off the shelves and bow tie sales up by 20 per cent in recent weeks.

A spokesperson for Debenhams, said: 'The amount a guy will spend on getting prom-ready is now close to rivalling a girl.

'However, the ladies seem to be better prepared - we have seen an increase in occasionwear sales since January whereas guys have been rushing in last minute to get ready for the big night.

'Male grooming products and treatments are also getting booked up; the rate of men coming in for spray tans has nearly doubled in the last month alone.'

The retailer has also seen an increase in male eyebrow threading appointments to give their ‘guy-brows’ the prom treatment.

The spokesman added: 'Prom fever has hit and guys are going all out to look their best and it doesn’t stop at the suit.

'Budding prom kings want to achieve a polished, groomed look and are looking to celebrities such as David Beckham and Daniel Craig for heir "promspiration".'

Stores in Scotland have seen the biggest increase in male promzillas and Liverpool has been inundated with guys coming in for spray tans to compete with the prom girls.
