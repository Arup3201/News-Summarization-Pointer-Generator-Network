Phil Neville has described the reaction to his first co-commentary experience as 'brutal' after returning home from the World Cup to discuss his Manchester United future.

The former United, Everton and England utility man made his debut on the microphone during England's 2-1 defeat by Italy on June 14, with his performance resulting in 445 complaints made to the BBC.

Writing in his BBC Sport column, Neville said: 'It was straight after the game that I found out the reaction to it all. I went on social media and it was pretty brutal.

Back to the day job? Neville coached at Manchester United last season but his future is unclear

'I understand why - it was an England game, late on a Saturday night back home, and emotions were running high. And, doing that job, I am there to be shot at.'

He added: 'The content of what I was saying was fine, it was just the tone of my voice that was the problem.

'I played it back the next day and it did not sound like it was me commentating. I was trying to be somebody I wasn't, and I knew I could do better than that.'

Neville, who co-commentated in a further three games for the BBC at the World Cup as well as regularly appearing as a studio guest, says he was delighted to see his former Everton team-mate Tim Cahill score one of the goals of the tournament in Australia's 3-2 defeat by Holland.

He added: 'Tim has probably been my 
closest friend for the past eight years and we still speak pretty much 
every other day even though he lives in New York now.

'To see him score a goal like that was 
brilliant. I spoke to him after the game and he was on cloud nine. It 
will go down as one of the great World Cup goals of all-time and I am so
 pleased for him.'

Neville has returned home to find out whether he still has a coaching role at United following the appointment of Louis van Gaal as manager.

The 37-year-old was taken back to Old Trafford by former United boss David Moyes last summer and remained as a coach during Ryan Giggs' spell in caretaker charge towards the end of last season.

It remains unclear whether his coaching future lies at Manchester United or not.
