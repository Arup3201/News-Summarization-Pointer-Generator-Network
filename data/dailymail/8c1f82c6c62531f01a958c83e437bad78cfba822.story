Wearing headphones while cycling is banned in a number of U.S. states, and London’s transport ministers are considering a similar ban in the UK.

A 17-year-old student has created a solution that not only mounts an iPhone securely to the handlebars of any bike - it doubles up a speaker.

The Allo case lets cyclists listen to music, make calls and use navigation apps completely hands-free, and without obstructing their hearing with earbuds.

The Allo, pictured, was invented by teenager Benji Miller. It is powered by two AAA batteries and has an output of up to 90 decibels - the same sound as a train horn, for example, and louder than city traffic. This means navigational instructions and voice calls are audible above everyday road noises

Once it has been attached, users can flick a switch on the bottom to turn the speaker on and off.

Inventor Benji Miller, from Santa Monica in California said: ‘After seeing many people riding while distracted and illegally use their earphones or holding their phones with one hand while biking, I wanted to create a way to be able to access my smartphone easily.

The case, pictured, is made from hardened plastic to protect the phone during an accident, and is adjustable meaning it fits on all handlebar sizes and at different angles. Cyclists can buy the Allo from Kickstarter for $40 (£24) and, if Miller achieves funding, the case is expected to retail for $45 (£27)

‘I was surprised to find that there was nothing on the market that did what I was looking for.’

The case is made from hardened plastic to protect the phone during an accident, and is adjustable meaning it fits on all handlebar sizes and can be positioned in different angles.

Miller set up a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of the Allo last month and is looking to raise $24,500 (£14,750).

The campaign ends on 13 April and Miller has so far raised $14,900 (£9,000).

Cyclists can buy the Allo from Kickstarter for $40 (£24) and, if Miller achieves funding, the case is expected to retail for $45 (£27).

The basic model comes in white, but there is a limited supply of gold versions available. Miller said he is also working on Allo cases for other models of phones.
