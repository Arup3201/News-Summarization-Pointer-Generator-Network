Forget the disappearing act in the semi-final.

Never mind the stats-men telling us that the only time he touched the ball in Holland’s penalty area  was when he got lucky with his middle-of-the-goal  spot-kick in the sudden-death shoot-out.

Let’s hear it for that team talk.

Follow the leader: Lionel Messi (centre) speaks to his Argentina team-mates before extra time

In their premature desperation to proclaim Lionel Messi as the greatest footballer of all time, the Argentinian’s sycophants are citing not the way he played for 120 minutes but what he had to say to his amigos between full-time and extra-time.

Look at the pictures, they protest. See how he takes over from manager Alejandro Sabella come the crunch.

For heaven’s sake, spare us.

Spare him, also. Because they do their own idol a disservice. Not least by ignoring that it was Javier Mascherano -  the man who really did most to squeeze Argentina through to Sunday’s World Cup Final against Germany -  who picked up the motivation mantle after the Dutch had threatened through the first 15 minutes of the additional half-hour.

Messi was literally Little Leo on this occasion. A peripheral figure in a match which, while important in its result, was monumental only by the scale of its tedium.

That does not mean Messi is anything less than an exceptional footballer, perhaps the finest of his generation.

But if he is to be elevated to the pantheon of Pele, Maradona, Garrincha and di Stefano it will take something other than a spot of tub-thumping in the huddle.

Stepping up to the plate: Javier Mascherano led the team talk at half-time during extra time

At his shimmering best, Messi is a delight to behold. As a shooting star in the highest firmament of the club game he may well be entitled to begrudge Cristiano Ronaldo being given his turn as world footballer of the year just because he himself had won that honour so often.

As it stands at this moment Messi  needs a final-winning spectacular against Germany  in the Maracana.  Not least because he has disappointed in his previous World Cups.

That will sound severe to Messi’s legion of admirers but it is only the most exacting judgement which makes any ultimate accolade worth receiving.

This is a challenge to which Messi is capable of rising and it will be sad for him, as well as unfortunate for us all, if suspicions that he may be less than totally fit for the grandest occasion of his life prove well-founded.

There did appear to be  a heaviness in the legs and perhaps a favouring of one of them against the Dutch.

Also, a hint of fleshiness about the jowels hinted at possible limitations on his training.

Certainly, the crisp finishing which had carried Argentina through the earlier stages of the tournament was missing. Although it has to be said that those four goals tended to mask performances which fell rather short of virtuoso splendour.

It may well be that the brutal tackling which has provided  a nasty undercurrent to Brazil 2014  is taking its toll of Messi.

If so, while the effects may not be as drastic as the crippling of  Neymar, they could be debilitating nonetheless.

If that is the case, the heart goes out to him.

If not, does he deserve as yet to be lacing up the boots in celestial company?

Not unless he pulls his socks up on Sunday.

So it’s goodnight from him, the Alan Hansen the twitter trolls love to hate.

And it’s goodnight from him, the Alan Hansen whose judgement the more considered BBC viewers seriously respect.

The TV football pundit who divides public opinion more sharply than any other is leaving the building for the last time on Sunday night.

And it's goodnight from me: Alan Hansen will retire as the BBC's leading television football pundit this Sunday

Hansen made his final appearance before the Match of the Day cameras in May.

Quite why, when he is not yet 60, is a matter between himself and his Auntie Beeb.

He will disappear from our screens for good – well, with the probable exceptions of occasional guest appearances – when the lights go out in that temporary glass studio on Copacabana beach.

Not a bad way to go out, a World Cup Final in Brazil.

The BBC are making a fuss about it which has included a documentary programme.

Nice of them. But switching off his broadcasting career of 20-odd years does not mark the most significant retirement of Hansen’s life.

Most of the younger tele-generation may not realise it but this man’s most profound analysis of the game was expressed on the pitch, when he was one of the most cerebral players of his era.

Having cut his Scottish teeth on helping Partick Thistle win the First Division title, and with it promotion to the Premier League, Hansen’s  made his lifetime career move to Liiverpool.

The apparently overt elegance and laid-back style which would come to irritate the detractors among his television audience were a source of enormous reassurance to his Anfield team-mates.

They called him 'Jockey' but they would have been better sticking to his original nick-name 'Stretch'.

That referred to the languorous manner in which he would extend one of those long legs to coax the ball away from opposing forwards and thereby snuff out danger with what looked like effortless ease.

Consider the importance of that classy contribution to a golden age of Liverpool domination both at home and in Europe.

Hansen won three European Cup winner’s medals. He helped Liverpool to eight English league titles and two FA Cups, which included the classic domestic double of 1986 to which he captained them under the management of Kenny Dalglish.

To all that, he can add our League Cups, one European Super Cup and six FA Charity Shields.

To some extent his abilities went less recognised in his own country. He played only 26 times for Scotland and was  dropped from the ill-fated squad for Mexico 86.

In part that related to the formidable centre-back pairing of Alex McLeish and Willie Miller which Sir Alex Ferguson had forged at Aberdeen.

It may have had something to do, also, with his seemingly aloof demeanour. That was at its most evident after he won the ball and proceeded to build attacks from the back with his calm, unhurried, perceptive passes.

If Scotland ever did produce a Bobby Moore,  It was Alan Hansen.

Enough said. Turn off the lights.

And a very good night to him.
