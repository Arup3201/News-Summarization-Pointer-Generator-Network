Airlines must take action to prevent passenger deaths from toxic fumes inside aircraft cabins, a coroner has warned.

Pressurised air tainted with jet fuel is risking the lives of everyone travelling on planes, Sheriff Payne said.

Demanding an urgent response from airline bosses, the Dorset coroner said: ‘In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.’

British Airways co-pilot Richard Westgate (pictured) died aged 43 in December 2012. His family are convinced that he was the victim of 'aerotoxic syndrome' and was poisoned to death by toxic fumes from plane cabins

The warning – which comes after Saturday’s Daily Mail revealed the poisoning fears over air in holiday planes – sparked accusations that airlines had been ignoring safety concerns for 15 years.

The coroner’s intervention is the first official recognition of Aerotoxic Syndrome, thought to be linked to memory loss, tremors, lethargy and even death.

He issued the warning after initial investigations into the death of British Airways pilot Richard Westgate in 2012. The 43-year-old, from Marlborough, Wiltshire, had suffered years of persistent headaches, nausea and chronic fatigue, which he long suspected was caused by toxic fumes in cockpits.

The coroner said inquiries into Mr Westgate’s death were not yet completed, but he was concerned by his initial findings. Mr Westgate’s parents Judy and Peter, who are awaiting an inquest into his death, last night claimed airlines and regulators had failed to act on evidence of poisoning.

Mrs Westgate, 74, said: ‘Richard would complain about his aircraft being smelly. He would go away and come back from work trips feeling worse. It is hard not to believe there has been some sort of cover-up.’

Sheriff Stanhope Payne, the senior coroner for Dorset who is currently investigating BA pilot Richard Westgate's death, has warned that those who are regularly exposed to plane fumes face 'consequential damage to their health'. He has now prepared a report which calls for urgent changes to prevent future deaths

Since 1999, the air industry has denied a link between so-called ‘fume events’ and medical problems. But a growing number of experts warn prolonged exposure is hazardous and can lead to long-term neurological and respiratory conditions, and brain tumours.

The problems are thought to arise when cabin air is drawn from the hot engines. Passengers are usually isolated from this ‘bleed air’ – but airlines accept that sometimes there is a leak and jet fuel contaminates the air with compounds called ‘organophosphates’.

Tristan Loraine (pictured), a former airline captain, believes the only long-term safe solution is 'for all aircraft to be built with the unique bleed free architecture currently flying on the Boeing 787'

In small quantities, these compounds may not be harmful – campaigners say it is most likely to create problems for frequent fliers and airline staff.

But the Dorset coroner said that if a pilot’s judgment is altered, every person on the plane may be at risk of death.

Mr Payne has written to British Airways boss Keith Williams and Andrew Haines, head of the Civil Aviation Authority, saying: ‘In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.’

He said he is concerned cabin occupants are being exposed to organophosphates, causing ‘damage to their health’.

Aerotoxic Syndrome was first suggested as a medical term in 1999. Two government inquiries have dismissed the risk as minimal.

But Frank Cannon of Cannons Law Practice, who is representing Mr Westgate’s family, said he has been approached by more than 50 former airline staff and two frequent fliers, and is preparing legal claims against a number of airlines.

‘It seems there is a mixture of crass ignorance and a cover-up,’ he said last night. ‘The airlines have known about this for a long time – we have seen staff who have been reporting this since 2000.’

Mr Cannon said some people are genetically protected, because they can break down the toxic compounds, but claimed others are vulnerable. He urged frequent fliers and crew to take DNA tests to see whether they are at risk.

Former British Airways captain Tristan Loraine, who flew for 19 years, said the problem was airlines’ ‘dirty little secret’. 

 

'Aerotoxic syndrome' is the term given to the 'illness' caused by exposure to contaminated air in jet aircraft.

Many former pilots, co-pilots and aircrew staff believe they have been subjected to long-term illnesses due to the amount of time they have spent exposed to cabin air and 'toxic fumes'.

Numerous scientific studies have been carried out since the late 1970s to try and determine whether contaminated cabin air is the cause of chronic health problems. 

Symptoms of 'aerotoxic syndrome' are said to include: Fatigue, blurred or tunnel vision, loss of balance, seizures, memory impairment, headaches, tinnitus, confusion, nausea, diarrhoea, breathing difficulties and irritation of the eyes, nose and upper airways. 

If Sheriff Stanhope Payne, the senior coroner for Dorset, rules in the inquest into the death of British Airways co-pilot Richard Westgate that cabin air was partly to blame for his death, then it will be the first time an independent judge in the UK has put this on record.

For years he suffered numb fingers and feet, nausea and a chemical blister on his nose. He was forced to retire in 2006 after becoming disorientated during flights, a problem his doctors have linked to fumes in the aircraft.

‘Like everyone else I trusted the industry … Some of my symptoms could be put down to just flying a lot and jetlag,’ he said. ‘The company doctors, whom I often saw, didn’t have any answers.’

A British Airways spokesman said it would ‘respond to the coroner in due course’.

Last week the airline said it saw ‘no trends in sickness rates which would indicate a link with cabin air issues’ and said studies had shown ‘no increase in overall cancer or mortality rates’ among crew.

A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said government-funded research had found that ‘any link to ill health is unlikely’ but said it would look at the coroner’s report.
