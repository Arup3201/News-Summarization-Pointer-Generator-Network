A Queensland woman who was dumped by her husband when he left her a note while she was at work is auctioning off his half of a planned romantic getaway to Bali.

Sarah-Jane Bell, from north Brisbane near Caboolture, is looking for a new travel partner after she booked a surprise holiday to the Indonesian holiday island with her husband, but he left her by leaving a note on the bed.

The 24-year-old posted an ad to eBay offering to sell return flights and accommodation in Kuta for anyone willing to spend nine days with a 'complete stranger'.

Sarah-Jane, from Brisbane, is selling her estranged husband's half of a holiday to Bali on eBay

Ms Bell said she returned home on September 20 last year to find that her husband (pictured left) had gone

Ms Bell said she was shocked when she returned home on September 20 last year to find that her husband - who she does not wish to identify - had left her a note saying he was no longer in love after eight years together.

'He still isn't able to give me a definitive answer as to why he left and why he doesn't love me anymore,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's pretty gut wrenching to be honest but everything happens for a reason and I've tried to put a positive spin on the whole thing.'

Ms Bell, who said the couple got married in 2012 on their six-year anniversary, added she had no idea the break up was coming.

'He'd been working away from home quite a lot last year, which put a bit of turmoil on our relationship, but I thought we were stronger than that,' she said.

Ms Bell said following the split she offered the Bali trip to three of her closest friends but when they weren't available she decided to take a gamble and sell it on eBay.

The 24-year-old's husband - who she had been with since she was 16 - left her a note on the bed

'Unfortunately, due to a series of unfavourable circumstances, my husband decided to pack up and call it quits, leaving a note on the bed when I returned from work,' she wrote in the listing.

'The rest is history, and that's why I have opted for the exciting option of none other but to AUCTION the return flight and accommodation with myself right here!'

There have been 48 bids placed since the listing was posted on Sunday, with the current bid sitting at $4300.

The 24-year-old said she was not necessarily looking for a romantic travel partner and would accept bids from males and females.

'I'm not looking for a relationship out of this, if anything more comes from it I'm not saying no but I'm not saying yes, I'm open to the experience,' she said.

Ms Bell has booked nine nights staying at the Kuta Beach Heritage Hotel

The hotel is on the waterfront of the Indonesian island's popular tourist spot

Ms Bell wrote in her eBay ad: 'Please be mindful that this is not a holiday to get sexed up in any way, shape or form.

'This is purely platonic. Yes I may be single, however there is no guarantee that anything will come from this trip.'

Ms Bell has some conditions for her potential travel partner, including that they must be aged between 18 and 32.

Bidders must message her after placing a bid and agree to a phone call, and the winning person must agree to a lunch 'meet and greet' before the departure date on February 3.

The 24-year-old said a number of people had already been in contact, adding that she doesn't have a specific type of person she hopes will win.

'I just want someone down-to-earth and ready for a bit of adventure,' she said.

Sarah-Jane says she is 'adventurous' and promises plenty of exciting experiences, including scootering around Bali and 'many' pub crawls

Ms Bell says she is 'adventurous' and promises plenty of exciting experiences, including scootering around Bali and its rainforests, 'many, MANY pub crawls', trying strange Indonesian foods and visiting the Monkey Temple.

She describes herself as an avid animal lover and a happy-go-lucky individual who is 'looking for the next exciting adventure in life.'

'Don't quite know what I am looking for in life, as it seems like the life plan I had has been completely turned upside down,' she said.

'All I do know is I don't want to live with a life full of regrets.

'Happy to try everything once in life, and maybe twice if I didn't learn the first time around haha!'

She said her potential travel partner must be aged between 18 and 32 and agree to meet before the holiday
