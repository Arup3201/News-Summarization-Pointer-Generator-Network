The results, unveiled by TIME today ahead of the voting deadline at 11.59pm on December 6, come just a day after thousands of protesters disrupted Black Friday shopping in dozens of U.S. cities.

The unarmed black 18-year-old was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson in the St Louis, Missouri, suburb of Ferguson, on August 9.
