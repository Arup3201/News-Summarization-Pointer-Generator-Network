Disillusioned: Anne said she 'could not adapt' to the pace of modern life and new technology

A retired art teacher committed suicide at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland after she grew weary of the pace of modern life and how technology was changing society.

The 89-year-old felt that her failing health, as well as her belief that people were becoming ‘robots’ attached to their gadgets, gave her little reason to live.

The woman, who wanted to be known only as Anne, had suffered from worsening health in recent years, but was neither terminally ill nor disabled.

Her
 case will stoke the ongoing debate over balancing a right to die 
against the dangers that vulnerable people could be exploited.

Yesterday
 critics warned that any relaxation in the law in Britain could lead to 
increased risks for the elderly and disabled.

Anne
 gave an interview days before she died in which she said computers and 
email had taken the humanity out of social interaction.

A
 keen environmentalist, she also said she worried about the impact of 
overcrowding and pollution on the planet, adding that the only thing 
that gave her pleasure was feeding birds in her garden in Sussex.

She
 described her feelings as she walked down supermarket aisles looking 
for fruit and vegetables to make soup, only to be appalled by the mass 
of ready meals.

In the 
interview, published in The Sunday Times, Anne said: ‘Why do so many 
people spend their lives sitting in front of a computer or television?

'I
 have never had a television, I have only had a radio ... people are 
becoming more and more remote. We are becoming robots. It is this lack 
of humanity.

‘I find myself swimming against the current, and you can’t do that. If you can’t join them, get off.’

She
 said she was dismayed that ‘all the old-fashioned ways of doing things 
have gone’, adding: ‘They say adapt or die. At my age, I feel  I can’t 
adapt, because the new age is not an age that I grew up to understand. I
 see everything as cutting corners.’

Anne was born in Kenya and never married or had children.

A
 former electrician with the Royal Navy, she was also a keen sportswoman
 and played tennis until the age of 70.

As she grew older, her health 
became increasingly poor and she suffered from heart and lung disease.

She described a recent 11-day stint in hospital as ‘unadulterated hell’ and lived in fear of ending up in a nursing home.

She
 committed suicide by taking a lethal overdose of barbiturates on March 
27, after saying: ‘I don’t want to die whimpering, but go out with a 
bang.’

In her submission to 
the Dignitas clinic, she wrote: ‘My daily action to feed birds in the 
garden is a joy. However, my lack of strength and energy and declining 
health is a life with no enviable future.

‘My life to date has been full, with so many adventures and tremendous independence.’

Her
 niece Linda, 54, who also wanted to be known only by her first name, 
agreed to accompany her aunt to Switzerland where they spent a few days 
sightseeing before going to the clinic.

Michael
 Irwin, a retired doctor who founded the Society for Old Age Rational 
Suicide and helped with Anne’s application to Dignitas, said: ‘She was a
 feisty individual and a very independent person all her life. When she 
became elderly and her daily activities became increasingly restricted, 
she decided to go to Dignitas.

‘If
 you are mentally competent you can rationalise whether or not you want 
to end your life, after you take a look around and decide you don’t like
 what you see.’

He said there were at least three people in similar circumstances to Anne who ended their lives in Switzerland in recent years.

There
 is to be a free vote in Parliament on the Assisted Dying Bill, under 
which two doctors could prescribe a lethal dose of drugs to a terminally
 ill patient with less than six months to live.

Anne’s case would not be covered by the new law. Last night it was unclear whether Linda could face police action.
