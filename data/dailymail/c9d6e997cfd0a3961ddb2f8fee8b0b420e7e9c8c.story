The search for 2013's winner is over

The Daily Mail is proudly running its seventh Inspirational Women of the Year Awards, in association with British Gas and the charity Shelter.

Over the coming weeks, we want you to nominate the special women who deserve to be recognised. Here, we tell the story of one of our remarkable nominees . . .

As soon as the telephone rang at 1am on August 12, 2000, Claire Maitland knew her life was about to irreparably change. 'My husband Robin answered, and I remember lying in dread,' she recalls.

'I thought, “Nobody ever rings at this hour unless something terrible has happened”.

'I looked at Robin, and could tell from his face our world had been ripped apart.'

On the phone was Claire's brother with the news her beloved 14-year-old nephew Sandy - a curly haired, freckle-faced boy with a cheeky smile - had drowned.

'I was paralysed with grief. I thought of his insatiable desire to climb trees, ride horses and scale mountains. I'd never known a boy to love life so much.'

Sandy Dickson had been holidaying in Canada with his grandmother Julia and cousin Ben when he joined a group of youngsters swimming in a remote lake in Ontario. Amid the high jinks, Sandy had lost consciousness. A helicopter had gone to the isolated spot, but medics were too late to save him.

Legacy: Claire setup the Sandpiper Trust in memory of her nephew Sandy, whose death in a tragic accident could have been prevented if medics had reached him in time

At Sandy's funeral at home near Dunblane, the children wore brightly coloured rugby shirts, his favourite sport. 'But Sandy's parents and the rest of our close family were plunged into a black hole of grief,' recalls Claire, 54.

'For months, we just existed. I couldn't stop thinking about Sandy's accident - and the remoteness of the lake where he drowned.

'I thought: “What if the same thing had happened in Scotland? Who would have been the first to reach him, and would they have been able to help?” '

In fact, often GPs and nurse volunteers are the first to reach casualties or extremely sick patients. While ambulance responders in Scotland are provided with emergency equipment by the NHS, GPs and nurses who first attend the scene are not.

'I started asking local doctors how well equipped they were to cope with accidents or critical illnesses in remote country areas. Their responses chilled me. Many GPs had no defibrillators - a machine that delivers an electric shock to the heart when someone is in cardiac arrest.

'One doctor said: “I dread hearing the words Is there a doctor in the house?, because I don't have the equipment to help anyone.” I realised more people like Sandy would die because of this critical lack of equipment. It started the tiniest seed of an idea.'

Tragedy: Sandy was 14-years-old when he died - since then his aunt has sought to change how emergency care operates in remote areas

She adds: 'One morning in February my sister Penny rang, very tearful, saying she did not know what to do with the rest of her life.'

'Something clicked and I suggested starting a trust in Sandy's memory. Two weeks later, we decided we wanted to provide vital medical equipment that on-call local doctors and nurses lacked in regional Scotland and the far-flung isles.

'I remember agreeing that if we could stop one family losing a loved one, it would be worth it.'In fact, the Sandpiper Trust has helped to supply life-saving equipment for 2,000 emergencies a year.

It worked with emergency doctors to design the distinctive blue Sandpiper Bag - containing 50 items of vital medical equipment, such as CPR face masks, mini tracheotomy kits, airway masks and stiff neck collars - to cover accidents and medical emergencies.

Nine hundred bags, costing £1,000 each, have been distributed to GPs and nurses throughout Scotland, and medics on islands where no 999 services exist.

With NHS funds stretched, many doctors had to buy their own defibrillators, or rely simply on CPR. So as well as blue equipment bags, the Sandpiper Trust has provided 48 defibrillators, at a cost of £1,000 each. Vital equipment, such as Pulse oximeters - machines that measure the level on oxygen in a patient's bloodstream - and canulas to give them fluid and blood, are provided and re-stocked as part of the Sandpiper Bags.

Crucially, the trust has also provided 80 vehicle locators, costing £1,000. These are radio units  placed into doctors' cars or carried with them, and work like tracking devices, allowing emergency dispatch centres to immediately locate the nearest available GP.

With 3,000 call-outs in the past 18 months alone, and £1.5 million raised in total, it means countless lives have been changed or saved.

Claire, a former veterinary nurse,  says: 'I set up office at our home in Banchory, Aberdeenshire, so I could work as my four children - then 14, ten, nine and eight - did homework and played. I was horrified to learn that just one needle, to put an intravenous line into the arm of a patient, cost up to £70.

Young promise: Sandy loved to ride horses, climb trees, scale mountains

'We launched in February 2001 and with Penny and her husband I arranged school fetes, cake sales, garden openings and quiz nights.

'In August 2001, a year after losing Sandy, we presented the first seven Sandpiper Bags. It felt like such an achievement. The following year, I organised a clay pigeon shoot, golf weekend and dinner, which raised £70,000.'

One of the many lives the trust has saved is Laura Anderson, 39, an oil company analyst, who was driving to work in a rainstorm on September 4, 2009.

Laura, from Aberdeen, recalls: 'It was 7am and I remember the car skidding into a lamp-post.

'I was trapped by both legs. When the fire engine arrived, they cut the roof off the car and I suddenly felt very sleepy.'

A volunteer doctor, consultant anaesthetist Mark Bloch, arrived with a Sandpiper Bag.

Mark, 47, recalls: 'I kept her airway open, using a specialist laryngeal mask provided by the trust. With no ambulance able to reach us in the extreme conditions, it was the only way to keep her breathing. She would have died before the ambulance arrived.

'It took the ambulance an hour to reach us because of the conditions. I later saw Laura in intensive care, and told her the equipment that saved her life had been provided by a remarkable woman who sits at her kitchen table.

'Week in, week out, I save lives using the equipment that Claire provides. If I have a bad day - recently three young people died - Claire finds time to ring and ask if I'm OK. She's fuelled by adrenaline and compassion.'

Laura, who now has a four-month-old son, says: 'Two years ago, I was with friends in remote mountains, when we saw a terrible accident involving two motorcyclists. A local GP was tending to them with a Sandpiper Bag. I pointed it out and said: “That's what saved my life, too.” Seeing the bags in action was incredibly emotional.'

Gillian McKenzie's three children have Claire to thank for their mummy's hugs. On November 6, 2012, when baby Sula was ten weeks old, 42-year-old Gillian suffered a cardiac arrest.

Gillian, from Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, says: 'My six-year-old son Struan fetched my neighbour, who realised I wasn't breathing.'

Neighbours desperately began CPR, but the arrival of a GP with a Sandpiper defibrillator saved Gillian. After two shocks, her heart began beating.'I met Claire for tea several months later, and we wept in each other's arms,' she says.

Claire's tireless fundraising - she starts work at 8am each day and is unpaid - is achievement enough. But she also volunteers as a ChildLine counsellor, and is patron of a hospice. Incredibly, she works through the agony of constant and debilitating migraines, which attack on average 17 days each month. 'My migraines drive me on because they make me angry. But they affect my balance and vision,' she says.

Three years ago, she organised a huge charity night, which raised £100,000. 'The morning after, I had a migraine so bad that my husband dialled 999 and I was blue-lighted in an ambulance because they thought it might be meningitis.'

She spent five days in hospital - then returned to work.

The Sandpiper Bag is now so well-known that dozens of requests from other countries are flooding in.

'Sandy would have been 27 now. I often wonder what he would look like, what he'd be doing with his life or who he might have ended up with.

'The only thing I know is he would have been so proud a trust in his memory has saved so many lives.'
