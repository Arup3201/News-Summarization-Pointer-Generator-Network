 

Shocking footage has emerged of three casino security guards pinning a man to the pavement and holding his head over a gutter filled with water as onlookers urge the bouncers to let the man go. 

After pushing the man on to the road, one of the guards can be seen holding his knee on the back of the man's head.

The clip was taken earlier this year outside Christchurch Casino's Mashina Lounge in New Zealand, and was filmed by a 23-year-old woman who witnessed the incident, reports Stuff NZ.

The video shows three security guards dragging a man across a footpath then holding his head in a gutter filled with water

After pushing the man onto the road, one of the guards can be seen keeping the man in the water by holding his knee on the back of his head

Witnesses can be heard yelling at the bouncers, saying, 'Oh my god, they're chucking him in the water,' before demanding the men 'get his head out of the water!'

The man, who appears to be bleeding from a wound on his forehead, screams profanities throughout the clip.

Gina Luisetti, who filmed the video, said the man has since contacted her on Facebook asking her to remove it. 

She also claimed another man threatened her with legal action on the night if she did not delete the footage.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Luisetti but she declined to comment.

New Zealand Security Association executive director Greg Watts condemned the behaviour of the guards, claiming their use of force was 'unacceptable.'

But Christchurch Casino chief executive Brett Anderson said the video was taken out of context, with earlier CCTV footage showing the man was kicked out of the bar due to his intoxicated behaviour.

Prior to the video, the man had reportedly abused a woman in the casino, then shoved a security member and threatened to attack them with a road cone.

Mr Anderson said the guards acted to protect their own safety and the safety of the man.

'Of course, everything can be done better but they're not punching him, kicking him or lashing out,' he told Stuff NZ.

Mr Anderson said he had received no formal complaints about the incident.
