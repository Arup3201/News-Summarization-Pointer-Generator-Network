Police and relatives are baffled after a potential hostage situation and a fatal police standoff erupted from a motel room filled with people with no obvious connection to one another.

Five people gathered at the Plaza Inn in Oklahoma City for an unknown reason on Wednesday afternoon - but a 911 hostage call led to a gun battle in which a woman died and four people were injured.

Samantha Rae Monden, a 30-year-old mother of two, was allegedly taken captive and shot in the head by Shane Leon Rhea, 39, an ex-convict.

Another man, Randall Leon Williams, 57, was shot in the back. Two police officers who responded to the situation were shot in the arm. 

Bonnie Boen, 30, a former Zumba instructor, was also in the room, as was her boyfriend Erik Patterson, 29, according to police reports. Neither were injured, though both are in police custody, according to The Oklahoman.

The situation - which is still surrounded in confusion - came to a head after a woman, whom police think is Bonnie Boen, called 911 to say she was being held captive.

Scene: The mysterious encounter happened at the Plaza Inn motel, next to the I-35 freeway

When officers arrived at the scene, around 4.30pm, and approached the motel room to investigate, shots were fired from inside.

Two officers, Sergeant Cody Koelsch and Sergeant Grant Brooks, were hit in the arm. Kolesch was also shot in the torso, but his bulletproof vest stopped the round.

Reports from the surviving people in the room say Rhea, who has previous convictions of burglary, assault and battery, shot Williams in the back at this point.

Police reports then describe how Rhea fled the room with Monden in tow - though it is not certain whether or not she was a hostage.

He ran from the motel onto a service ramp for the I-35 freeway, and reportedly shot Monden in the head with a semi-automatic handgun. An officer then shot Rhea with a rifle, which he survived.

Rhea was arrested on suspicion of murder, kidnapping and shooting with intent to kill.

Involved: Bonnie Boen, left, and her boyfriend Erik Patterson, right, were also at the meeting. Both were put in jail over previous charges, though neither has been formally linked to the shooting

Boen and Patterson were also arrested, but over previous complaints. Neither has been charged over the shoot-out Wednesday.

The motivations behind the meeting - and the subsequent gunfight - remain unclear.

A cousin of Monden told the Oklahoman: 'Nobody has any idea why she was there. We don’t know. We don’t understand.'

A spokesman for Oklahoma City police told reporters at an impromptu press conference after the incident that it was unclear how many shots were fired, by whom, or why the people had come together.

However, it has been suggested that the meeting could have been to do with drugs.

Boen's estranged husband, Joe Shaddix, said that Rhea, Patterson and Boen had met before, and that his wife has an amphetamine problem.

He said: 'This was about drugs. There’s no doubt about it.'
