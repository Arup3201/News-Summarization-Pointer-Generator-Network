Screen siren: Gina Lollobrigida posing for publicity shots in 1961

Gina Lollobrigida’s ex-lover Javier Rigau told for the first time last night of his ‘devastation’ after the

Italian film star accused him of faking their wedding.

He insisted that they had married in secret in 2010 and said he has never had any interest in Ms Lollobrigida’s £35 million fortune – substantiating his claim by revealing he signed two financial agreements before the wedding.

The former screen goddess, 85, last week claimed he was a ‘vulture’ who duped her into marrying to get his hands on her money.

But Mr Rigau, a Spanish businessman himself said to be worth £36 million, said: ‘It’s monstrous. She knows we are married and I have never been interested in her money. I am an independently wealthy businessman and I have earned every penny I own. We signed two financial agreements before the wedding.

‘One was a separation of assets, so although we are married we have our own independent assets. The second was a pre-nuptial agreement so I stand to earn absolutely nothing from the  marriage.’

Ms Lollobrigida has claimed to Italian police that she had discovered  Mr Rigau had used fake documents to carry out a marriage by proxy without her knowledge just over two years ago. In such a ceremony, an absent bride or groom’s vows can be spoken by someone else on their behalf.

But Mr Rigau insisted they married out of love and enjoyed a healthy physical relationship despite a 34-year age gap. In an exclusive interview at his sprawling mansion in one of Barcelona’s plushest neighbourhoods, Mr Rigau, 51, claimed they were happily married, albeit secretly, until just two weeks ago.

Mr Rigau said: ‘We have been together for almost 30 years and Gina wanted to get married. We were madly in love.

‘It’s devastating for me to hear her speaking about me the way she is. I am a very private person and I am only speaking about this because Gina has said some very hurtful things publicly in the press.

‘I believe she has been turned against me and against everyone else who loves her – her family and friends – by a new adviser. It breaks my heart to hear her speaking about me the way she is.’

MR Rigau’s claims add a new twist to a story so bizarre it is worthy of any Hollywood blockbuster. Ms Lollobrigida, once described as ‘the most beautiful woman in the world’, was one of cinema’s biggest names in the Sixties.

The actress first met Mr Rigau, a debonair entrepreneur from Barcelona, at a party in Monte Carlo in 1984.Despite their age difference, they fell in love and had a passionate romance.

The couple lived a glamorous, jet-set lifestyle, moving between homes in Rome, Sicily, Monte Carlo and Barcelona.

They made plans to marry in New York in November 2006, and later changed the plan to wed in Rome in January 2007.

But the wedding was called off because Mr Rigau could not cope with the media spotlight. To the outside world, the relationship was over.

But Mr Rigau, who drives a Rolls-Royce
Silver Cloud, now claims they could not bear to be apart and got back 
together four months later, keeping their relationship secret to avoid 
publicity.

He said they decided to marry by proxy to avoid the media attention their previous wedding plans had attracted.

That account is in stark contrast to the actress’s version of events.

She
has accused him of being a fraudster who conned her into signing proxy 
wedding papers in order to inherit her fortune on her death.

Ms
Lollobrigida, who lives in Rome, revealed her claims about the ‘fake 
wedding’ in an interview with an Italian newspaper last week.

She
said: ‘This vile person married me by proxy, without my knowledge and 
without my permission, in order to inherit my estate after my death.’ In
another interview with the Daily Mail, she said she wanted Rigau jailed
over the ‘fraud’.

The 
former sex symbol said she discovered the marriage after stumbling 
across documents on the internet published by a disgruntled ex-business 
partner of Mr Rigau.

However,
Mr Rigau said Ms Lollobrigida flew to Barcelona in August 2010 with her
lawyer Giulia Citana to sign an agreement to marry by proxy. The papers
were signed in front of a notary at the five-star Princesa Sofia Hotel 
near FC Barcelona’s Camp Nou football ground, he said.

He added the proxy marriage took place on November 29, 2010, at the Sant Vicenc church in Sarria, where Mr Rigau lives.

A
mutual friend, Maria Pilar Guimera Gabilondo, 72, from Barcelona, stood
in for the actress at the ceremony, which was attended by eight guests.
Last night she revealed Ms Lollobrigida asked her to be her stand-in at
the wedding.

‘She asked me
to represent her at the church because she wanted to keep it secret 
from the press,’ Mrs Gabilondo told a newspaper.

Mrs Gabilondo said that she and Mr Rigau, who is a family friend in Barcelona, went with Miss Lollobrigida to see a notary to sign the legal papers.

‘Of course I thought it was strange that she didn’t want to attend her own wedding, but if a woman like that asks, you don’t say no,’ she added.

‘I’ve met her many times when she visited Javier in Spain and I’m astounded she now claims to know nothing about me or the wedding.’

Mr Rigau, whose full name is Francisco Javier Rigau y Rafols, said: ‘The idea Gina did not know she was getting married is preposterous.

‘She was as keen as I was to marry. That’s why she flew to Barcelona to sign the papers.

‘Unfortunately, over the past two years Gina has been getting some very bad advice. She has fallen out with her son Mirko, her 18-year-old grandson Dimitri, her lawyer and many friends. I was the last person left from her inner circle and now she has been turned against me.

‘I last saw her in Rome two weeks ago and everything was fine. She never mentioned any problems.’

Mr Rigau, who owns a property company in Spain,  says she is denying knowledge of the wedding because of the influence of her new manager , 25-year-old Andrea Piazzolla.

The mystery deepened on Friday when Ms Lollobrigida’s former lawyer, Giulia Citani, told The Mail on Sunday that the marriage did take place.

Speaking from her office in Fiumicino, near Rome, she said: ‘You have to remember Gina is 85 so she sometimes has trouble remembering things but I can tell you she is legally married. There is legal documentation in Spain which proves that she agreed to be married and that the ceremony took place.

‘I don’t really want to go into too much detail as I can’t betray my lawyers’ oath – also I no longer represent Gina as we had a disagreement.

‘I accompanied Gina to Barcelona and documents were signed at the Italian consulate which authorised the marriage and this document was used for the marriage.

‘Gina is confused and perhaps doesn’t remember what happened.’

In Rome The Mail on Sunday approached Ms Lollobrigida’s 64-year-old son Mirko, from her first marriage to Slovenian Mirko Skofic, but he refused to comment.
