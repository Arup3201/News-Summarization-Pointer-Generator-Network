A woman accused of drowning defenceless kittens claims she must have been drugged, a court heard today.

Marilyn Huck, 53, killed two cats at her home in north London, Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court heard.

Appearing in a green top, tartan skirt and grappling with plastic bags, Huck spoke only to confirm her name and enter a plea.

She told the Court: 'One wishes to plead not guilty to both charges.'

She faces two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.

Defence lawyer Jay Hussain said: 'Ms Huck says although she accepts that the kittens have died there was no intention on her behalf in respect of how the kittens had passed away.

'She says that her food and water was spiked by one of the complainants who reported her to the police regarding the two kittens.'

Mr Hussain added: 'Her food was spiked at the time of this ordeal.'

Huck was released on bail on the condition she does not contact the complainant directly or indirectly.

Huck from Enfield, northeast London, will face trial at Highbury Magistrates' Court on September 24.
