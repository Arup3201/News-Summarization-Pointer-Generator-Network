The richest people in Britain had a bumper year as their wealth surged to a combined total of £518billion.

Between them the thousand richest Britons now have assets worth as much as a third of the entire UK's annual output - up from £450billion this time last year.

The huge total is further proof that Britain is the capital of the world for the super-rich, with more billionaires per head than anywhere else on earth.

Glamorous figures such as Emma Watson and the Queen rubbed shoulders in the rankings with the business elite and aspirant tech millionaires.

The identities of the richest men and 
women in the country were revealed in today's Sunday Times Rich List, 
which ranks the 1,000 richest Britons every year. To qualify this year a
 minimum fortune of £85million was necessary.

As well stalwart figureheads of affluence including Richard Branson, the Barclay Brothers and the Queen, the list also pointed out a number of internet successes, including the man behind insurance site comparethemarket.com.

South African insurance tycoon Douw 
Steyn, who funded the ubiquitous Compare the Meerkat adverts, saw his wealth go up by £50 million 
to a total of £600 million, ranked 170.

He was joined by the creators of the addictive Candy Crush smartphone app, as well as the brother behind the violent Grand Theft Auto videogame series.

Four 
members of King Digital Entertainment, which publishers Candy Crush, joined the list. They include entrepreneur Mel Morris, who came in at 238 with a £430 million 
fortune, and King's chief executive Riccardo Zacconi, ranked 271 with 
£354 million.

Sam and Dan Houser, whose fortune stems from Rockstar Games, which publishes the wildly popular Grand Theft Auto titles, were new entries at 947 with a
 joint fortune of £90 million.

Sweet reward: Candy Crush entrepreneur Mel Morris was a new entrant with a £430million fortune

Addictive: Candy Crush has millions of users, many of whom pay to play the game

Nevertheless, the firm's founders are still in line for a monumental windfall.

To get into the top 500, the rich need £190 million - double the £80 million required in 2004 and up £30million from the £160million cut off point for last year's list.

Philip Beresford, who has compiled the ranking since 1989, said: 'I've never seen such a phenomenal rise in personal wealth as the growth in the fortunes of Britain's 1,000 richest people over the past year.

'The richest people in Britain have had an astonishing year.

'While some may criticise them, many of these people are at the heart of the economy and their success brings more jobs and more wealth for the country.'

Most distinguished among the old money names, the Queen had a sterling year as she added £10 million to her personal fortune and is now ranked 285 with £330 million.

Well-established
 Rich List millionaires such as Jamie and wife Jools Oliver saw their 
worth go up by £90 million to £240 million, ranking them at 396, as the 
celebrity chef's restaurant chain, TV appearances, cookbook sales and 
Jool's childrenswear range continued to pay dividends.

Former
 Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy, who stepped down at the supermarket chain 
in 2011, was among the new entrants with a worth of £100 million, 
ranking at 863.

Meanwhile,
 American film producer Harvey Weinstein and his British former model 
turned designer wife Georgina Chapman also made the grade for the first

Entertainers featured heavily in the 50 Young Rich list for those aged 30 and under.

Former

million, up £3 million on last year, as she builds a career for herself 
as a Hollywood leading lady.

Husband
 and wife Marcus Mumford 27, and Carey Mulligan, 28, joined the young 
list for the first time with a joint fortune of £13million from their 
music and films.

Last week it was announced that the list's compilers had found that the number of billionaires living in Britain has risen to more than 100 for the first time.

Some 104 billionaires are now based in the UK - more than triple the number from a decade ago - with a combined wealth of more than £301 billion.

It means Britain has more billionaires per head of population than any other country, while London's total of 72 sterling billionaires is more than any other city in the world

The 26th annual Sunday Times Rich List will be released tomorrow with profiles of the 1,000 richest individuals and families in the UK and the wealthiest 250 in Ireland.

It is based on 'identifiable wealth' - including land, property, other assets such as art and racehorses, or significant shares in publicly quoted companies. It does not include money held in bank accounts.
