A keen gardener who poisoned her estranged sister's prized vegetables  in a  four-year  feud over the family will has been ordered to pay her £5.

Gillian Leeden poured weed killer over older sister Lyndsey Glassett's Jerusalem artichokes as part of a bitter row over their late mother's estate.

The 62-year-old claimed she mistook the plants for weeds when she killed them whilst her 67-year-old sister was away for the weekend on May 23.

Leedon had previously received a police caution after setting up a website to publish 'very unpleasant comments' about her sister and her sister's family. The sisters have not been on speaking terms since 2010.

The plants had been growing at the sister's home in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, where both live in a semi-detached property split into two separate maisonettes.

Prosecution barrister Harry Snook told Stevenage Magistrates' Court: 'It was Lyndsey Glassett who had bought the artichokes, who planted them and who for several years had grown them in that exact spot for the pleasure she took in gardening.

'The relationship (between the sisters) was very poor. They had not spoken for a number of years and there was a good deal of ill feeling between them related to the care provided to their late mother and disputes about their mother's estate.

'That, the prosecution say, explains what we say is a quite deliberate and spiteful act to the plants she would have known we the property of her sister.

'She doesn't dispute she poured the poison on the plants. She said she believed them to be weeds rather than a desirable plant.'

Leedon told the court the garden had been 'a mess' and she was simply attempting to tidy up and remove some weeds when she poisoned her sister's prize artichokes (stock picture of artichoke)

'It is difficult to imagine that anyone would think they (the plants) weren't being cultivated. Even to a layman I would suggest it was not a weed, but to someone with gardening experience, even more so.

'We know there was motive for her to act intentionally. This is someone who let a personal grudge get the better of them.'

Ms Glassett told the court she had purchased the Jerusalem artichoke tubers (shrubs) for £10.95 from a garden centre approximately 18 months earlier.

She said: 'They can grow up to about ten to 12 feet. I had used them in stews, soups and as vegetables, as well as giving some to friends.'

But when she returned from her weekend away, she found the plants had been tampered with.

She told the court: 'When I came home they were obviously dead because all of the leaves were discoloured and they weren't alive.

'I was more annoyed than anything because I was going to leave the house within weeks. If she'd waited I would have dug them up and taken them with me or she could have killed them when I'd gone.'

But magistrates ruled that Leeden's actions amounted to criminal damage and she was handed a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £5 compensation to her sibling, £310 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge

Asked about her relationship with her sister, she said: 'It was non-existent. We hadn't been on speaking terms since 2010.'

Ms Glassett also described her sister as 'an excellent gardener' who 'grows vegetables I haven't even heard of.'

Ms Leedon, taking the stand, told the court she was attempting to tidy up the weeds from the entrance to the property, where she runs her own hair laser removal business.

She said: 'The place was a mess, I wanted it tidy. I had clients there and I didn't think it looked good with them coming up to all this mess.

'There were some (weeds) covering the garden and some grasses that were six or seven inches tall. There were six or seven types of plant there and it just looked a mess.'

Asked what she believed they were, she said: 'Weeds.'

But magistrates ruled her actions amounted to criminal damage after hearing no evidence that the estate's executors had given permission for the weeds to be removed. 

Chairman of the bench Peter Sweetman said: 'We have heard from your evidence that you did damage the plants and intended to do so.

'We have been told you believed you would have got the consent of the executors to clear the plants but we have heard no evidence to support that and therefore we find your guilty of criminal damage.'

Prosecutor Mr Snook asked magistrates to take into account the previous police caution when considering their sentence.

He said: 'She received a police caution in 2013 for malicious communications. She had set up a website and made numerous and very unpleasant comments about her sister and her sister's family.'

Leedon was handed a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £5 compensation to her sibling, £310 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Neither of the sisters would speak as the left the court building separately.
