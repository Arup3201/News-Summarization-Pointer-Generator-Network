Finally, Norman Chaney, better known as 'Chubby' from the seminal pre-war serial 'Our Gang' is to get a headstone to grace his unmarked Baltimore grave.

Lying anonymously in a plot of section E of Baltimore Cemetery for over 75 years, Chaney is to benefit from a $4,000 fundraising drive from a society headed by an 'Our Gang' enthusiast.

Dying at the age of 21 in May 1936 after complications from surgery to treat a 'glandular disorder', the one-time child actor suffered from the effects of obesity throughout his teenage years.

Playing the wildly popular 'Chubby' character in the 'Our Gang' comedies from 1929 to 1931, Chaney replaced the original actor who played the 'fat kid' role but become synonymous with the character.

Visitors to the cemetery in a working class neighbourhood of Baltimore have always been guided to his unmarked grave by looking to the left of his grandparents Mildred and William Myers final resting places, near to some buttercups.

'There's people out there, lots of them all over the world, who remember him very well,' said Bob Satterfield, a high school activities director from Californian who is helping with the fundraising drive.

'We're just trying to make this correct, so people can pay homage and leave flowers and gifts.'

Although Satterfield and his fellow 'Our Gang' devotees desire a large plinth to make up for the years of anonymity, Baltimore Cemetery will only allow a slab the size of a large toaster.

Sticking to the wishes of the 
cemetery, Satterfield has said that they will therefore try to get a 
black granite tombstone with his round, expressive face engraved onto 
it.

Using the internet social fundraising site called Indiegogo.com, fans of Chaney have so far raised $476.

Offering up one of 20 autographed 
pictures of the original 'Chubby', Joe Cobb, to anyone who donates more 
than $50, Satterfield would like to raise enough money to purchase a 
stone for Chaney's mother, Carolyn, who lies in another unmarked grave 
next to her son according to the Baltimore Sun

Beating 2,000 other boys to the role, the expressive features of Norman Chaney playing 'Chubby' (centre) made him a fan favourite

Recognised
as one of the most influential comedy shows produced from the 1920's to
the early 1940's, 'Our Gang' began as a silent short series in 1922 and
is viewed as the direct precursor to the legendary 'Laurel and Hardy' 
series.

The program is known for being among the first to have black and white children acting together.

Winning
a competition in 1929 to become the new 'Chubby' or as the character 
was better known, the 'fat kid', Chaney was the son of a Baltimore 
electrical worker.

With excellent comic timing, round face and his bare-faced cheek, Chaney became adored by American audiences, eventually replacing Cobb in their affections.

'Our Gang' ran from 1922 to 1944 and is credited with being one of the first television shows to cast both white children and black children such as Norman Chaney (centre right)

The teenage star was able to showcase his acting skills as 'Our Gang' or 'Little Rascals' as it became known made the transition from silent to sound production.

Winning the national contest to play the role of 'Chubby', Chaney made a massive impression on fans in the two years from 1929 to 1931 that he appeared in the show.

By the spring of 1931, Chaney who had joined weighing 113 pounds and standing 3' 11" began to increase in weight and height.

However, this was not before he had appeared in one famous episode entitled 'Love Business' in which he has a crush on his teacher Miss Crabtree.

In this short he utters the immortal line, 'Don't call me Norman, call me 'Chubsy-Ubsy' when attempting to woo her.

His contract was not renewed in 1931, after losing his expressiveness according to the producers led by Hal Roach, who created Laurel and Hardy.

It is reputed that after beating 2,000 other boys to the role, Chaney said to Roach, 'Mister, are you just kidding me because I'm fat?'

'Our Gang' started off life as a silent series of shorts but transitioned to sound in the late 1920's and became known by the other title of 'Little Rascals'

Returning home to continue his studies, his weight ballooned, ill health followed and he died at the age of 21 at the West Lombard Street home of his grandparents in Baltimore.

The New York Times reported the death with the headline, 'Norman Chaney Dies; Fat Boy of 'Our Gang'.

The group trying to provide a headstone for the one-time child actor have said that if they don't get to $4,000 they will buy anything to simply mark the spot.
