It was hardly ideal weather for a spot of naked exhibitionism.

But swirling winds and plunging temperatures didn’t deter this man from turning himself into an unexpected stop on the itinerary for central London sightseers yesterday.

Within minutes of climbing on to the 30ft statue of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, in Whitehall at midday, he stripped naked and started to shout at bystanders.

Scroll down for video.

On his head: Police were forced to close an entire section of the road - which runs between the Houses of Parliament and Trafalgar Square - while specialist officers tried to coax the man down

Acrobatic: The man's motives for the extravagant display of public nudity remain unclear

The end of a showdown: Finally, after just over three hours atop the life-size memorial he was finally brought down and taken away in a police van. It is understood he has been detained under the Mental Health Act

At one point he stood precariously atop the statue with his arms outstretched. He also appeared to take the sword from the statue and wave it about.

At another, he perched acrobatically - with his arms out stretched 
for balance - upon the Duke's feathered plume, before sitting down on his 
head.

Hundreds of baffled passers by 
gathered in the busy road, which runs between the Houses of Parliament 
and Trafalgar Square,  to watch the exhibition unfold in wonder.

Finally, after just over three hours atop the monument, 
he finally gave up and climbed down before police took him away in a marked van.

Police said he has not been arrested but detained under the Mental Health Act at a secure hospital in London.

The man's motives for the extravagant display of public nudity remain unclear.

The spectacle began at around midday today, when he scaled the statue and broke off its hand, before throwing all his clothes to the ground.

One witness, Richard, who owns a street souvenir stand, said he had been acting strangely before climbing onto the statue.

He said: 'He was walking around this one acting weird, just sniffing around.

'Then he starting walking down the middle of the road and just started running towards the statue - he was legging it.

'He literally just scampered up there very quickly. He climbed up and sat down on it and then got undressed.

'He ruined our business for the day.'

Commotion: Hundreds of baffled passers by gathered in the busy road - which runs between the Houses of Parliament and Trafalgar Square - to watch the exhibition unfold before he was taken away

Stubborn: Despite temperatures hovering around 8C, chilled further by a mild south-westerly breeze, the man, thought to be in his 30s, stubbornly remained on his perch apparently ignoring officers' pleas

An office worker, who asked not to be named, said: 'We heard something was going on outside the building, the guy had got up on the statue.

'It looked as if he had somehow ripped the sword off the statue, he had taken the sword off then he was whacking the actual statue with the sword calling out things and waving the sword about.

'He was saying something about Ukraine 'my father came from Ukraine' or something, he then threw the sword down and police recovered it.

'He then moved all over the statue, different positions and kept calling out with his arms up in the air and he was throwing up, he must have been on drugs.

'At that point, he still had his clothes on. Then he decided he was going to strip off and make it more dramatic.

Onlooker Savannah Severn, 16, said: 
'I was on a school trip, on my way to the National Portrait Gallery and I
looked up and saw the naked man on the statue.

'There were police on horses pushing the crowd back and firemen were trying to get him down.

'I was really shocked but it was quite funny. It looked like he was posing and he hard his arms stretched out wide.'

The man's motives for the extravagant display of public nudity remain unclear.

A police officer said the cordon had been pushed back because the man got angry with people taking photos of him.

He said there had been reports of 'implements' being found in the man's clothes.

Passerby Leanne, on her way home from St Thomas' Hospital, said it was hilarious.

Chilly: The unidentified man could be seen waving his arms, apparently speaking to emergency services on the ground, and did not seem to be holding anything

Crowds of onlookers had gathered at either end 
of the cordon. The naked man is believed to have been clothed when he 
climbed on to the statue

'We had to get out of the cab because it couldn't get through - we didn't expect this,' she said.

'It's
hilarious, we'll it's obviously not funny for people who can't get 
through but climbing a statue with no clothes on is one way to bring 
London to a standstill.'

He
could be seen waving his arms, apparently speaking to emergency 
services on the ground, and did not seem to be holding anything.

A spokesman said: 'We are talking to the man and will try and bring the situation to a resolution a soon as we can.'

While the statue of Prince George will be well-used to pigeons perching on its head, naked people are rare.

Bizarre: Wearing black the man climbed to the top of the statue posed. His motives for the extravagant display of public nudity remain unclear

Born in Germany in 1819, the Duke was the son of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, the 10th child and 7th son of King George III and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

As a man he joined the British army and rose to the rank of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces from 1856 to 1895.

He died of a stomach haemorrhage in 1904 at Gloucester House, Piccadilly, London, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

His title, the Duke of Cambridge, fell into extinction upon his death and was not revived until 107 years later, when Elizabeth II awarded the title to her grandson, Prince William, now the Second Duke of Cambridge.
