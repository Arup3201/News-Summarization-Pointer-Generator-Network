A heartbreaking suicide pact taken in 1915 between a soldier and his wife so they could avoid the horrors of the First World War has been discovered in archives.

Shadrach Critchley, 35, and his wife Annie, 45, were found lying side by side on a mattress at their home in Leigh, Greater Manchester, on Monday May 24, 1915 - shortly after Mr Critchley was recruited to the Cheshire Regiment.

A newspaper cutting from the time reveals that alongside the couple were two handwritten notes, expressing their wish 'never to be parted'.

The tale was uncovered by volunteer historian and genealogist Susan Berry, 50, who came across the incident during her research.

Ms Berry, from Leigh, said: 'When most people think of World War One they tend to think of men dying on the front line or from injuries received in combat, but Shadrach’s and his wife’s deaths were also a direct result of the war.

'I’m not sure what people’s attitudes would have been like at the time towards events like these.

'The story made me think about what people must have been going through emotionally when the men went off to war.'

Born in 1881, Mr Critchley was brought up in Leigh and followed his father Thomas down the pit, working as a coal miner.

He married Annie Heaton in 1906 and the census five years later suggests they lived in Westleigh, Greater Manchester, and did not have any children.

Mr Critchley is listed in the local newspaper in April 1915 as a new recruit to the Army and was stationed at Birkenhead, but returned home on May 22 for three days’ leave.

According to friend and fellow soldier Richard Adamson, he was at the Fleece Inn the night before he was due to rejoin his regiment, telling him he had made a mistake in enlisting in the forces.

Mr Adamson said he had tried to reassure him it would be fine but when he went to the Critchleys’ house the following evening, he forced open the door and found both Shadrach and Annie on a mattress on the kitchen floor.

An inquest heard the couple had written notes expressing their wish not to be parted, and were buried together in St Paul’s churchyard in Westleigh.

At the inquest, the jury, who heard evidence concerning their deaths, recorded a verdict of temporary insanity.

Mr Critchley’s name was finally given posthumous recognition when he was placed on the Brookwood Memorial, in a list of around 500 men who died on British shores.

The memorial, located in Surrey alongside a huge cemetery containing the final resting place of more than 1,500 Commonwealth servicemen who died in the UK of their wounds, was erected in 2004, almost 90 years after Shadrach’s death.

Hannah Turner, local and family history officer at Leigh Local Studies, said: 'It’s a very sad story and one we had never come across before.

'It shows that the deaths during the war didn’t just happen on the battlefield.'
