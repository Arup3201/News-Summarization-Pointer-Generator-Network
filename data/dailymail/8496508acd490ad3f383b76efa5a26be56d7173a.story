It is the device that merged technology with style and revolutionised the entire tech industry.

Yet five years after the release of the first iPhone, Apple's legendary designer Sir Jonathan Ive has admitted that the company almost cancelled the product that made him a household name.

Sir Jonathan - known affectionately as Jony to Apple fans - said: 'There were multiple times where we nearly shelved the phone because we 
thought there were fundamental problems that we can't solve ... [such as] ... where I put the phone to 
my ear and my ear dials the number.'

The designer was speaking at an Olympic-themed British Business Embassy event this week, which was attended by Kate Middleton and other special guests.

Sir Jonathan talked through Apple's design process, and said Apple did not want to pander to profits or market research, instead just wanting to focus on making great designs and products.

He said: 'I refute that design is important. Design is a prerequisite. Good design - innovation - is really hard.

'Really great design is hard. Good is the enemy of great. Competent 
design is not too much of a stretch. But if you are trying to do 
something new, you have challenges on so many axes.

'We say no to a lot of things that we want to do and are intrigued by so that we only work on a manageable amount of products and can invest an incredible amount of care on each of them.'

Explaining his inner processes, Sir Jonathan, who was knighted this year, said: 'We have been, on a number of occasions, preparing for mass production 
and in a room and realised we are talking a little too loud about the 
virtues of something.

'That to me is always the danger, if I'm trying to 
talk a little too loud about something and realising I'm trying to 
convince myself that something's good.

'You have that horrible, horrible feeling deep down in your tummy and 
you know that it's okay but it's not great.

And I think some of the 
bravest things we've ever done are really at that point when you say: "That's good and it's competent, but it's not great".'

Ive also said that market research was never Apple's way: 'It will guarantee mediocrity and will only work out whether you are going to offend anyone.'

Ive joined Apple in 1992, when the company was struggling and Steve Jobs had been forced out of the company. But Jobs spotted Ive's eye for detail and minimalist yet ambitious styles, and between them worked together to make technological history.

But as Ive said, the process was about making 'the best possible products that we
can, that genuinely means saying no because we don't believe it's good 
enough.'

Instead, he and Steve Jobs would sit for hours in Ive's workshop, hunched over various prototypes, discussing the tiniest details on each before deciding on to the finished product.

And from those meetings, the result was a revolution in the smartphone world.
