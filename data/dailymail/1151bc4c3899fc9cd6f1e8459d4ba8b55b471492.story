A man has been arrested and bailed following the 'suspicious' death of a woman found floating in the water at a boat club - just hours after a children's Easter Egg hunt took place in the grounds.  

The victim, who has not been formally identified but is thought to be in her 60s, was discovered at Derby Motor Boat Club in Sawley, Leicestershire, on Sunday night.

A 65-year-old man was arrested in connection with her death before being released on police bail.

The club's Rear Commodore, Steve Bilbie, said: 'We are very upset, but we can't say anything else'

The area was cordoned off for forensic examination and detectives say the investigation is in its 'early stages'.

A spokesman for Leicestershire Police said a post-mortem examination had failed to establish a cause of death and that results of further tests would not be known 'for some time'.

Detective Chief Inspector Mick Graham, who is leading the investigation, said: 'At this stage we're treating the incident as a suspicious death.

'Officers will be carrying out inquiries locally to locate potential witnesses to any activity around the marina yesterday evening.

Police at the scene today - officers are continuing to investigate the woman's 'suspicious' death

A 65-year-old man has been arrested and released on bail in relation to the woman's death

'If you have any information which you believe may be able to assist us then please get in touch.'

The woman's body was discovered at around 10.21pm on Sunday in the marina in Warren Lane.

The Derby Motor Boat club, which has an annual fee of £750, was founded in 1938 by a group of local businessmen.

Its current Rear Commodore, Steve Bilbie, said: 'We are very upset, but we can't say anything else as there is an ongoing investigation.'

A description of the club on its website reads: 'We are situated on the River Trent at Sawley close to the junctions of the Trent with the River Soar, the Erewash Canal and the Trent.'

The boat club has space for 130 boats on individual moorings, which stretch around a third of a mile along the bank of the canal. Each has access to water and electricity. 

The club also has a headquarters, based in a portable building, children's play area, toilet and shower block.

Leicestershire Police (headquarters pictured) said a post-mortem failed to establish a cause of death and results of further tests would not be known 'for some time'. The woman has not been formally identified
