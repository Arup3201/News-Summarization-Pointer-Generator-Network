This is the stunning time-lapse that shows the migration of 1.5million wildebeest in Northern Serengeti, Tanzania.

Captured by wildlife photographer Will Burrard-Lucas and his brother Matt, the footage was shot over five days, and condensed to just one minute.

The incredible scenes, which show the wildebeest moving from Kenya into Tanzania, was a finalist in the new time-lapse category at this week's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition.

On his blog, Burrard-Lucas explains that time-lapse was the only way in which to properly capture the 'awe-inspiring' migration he witnessed.

'We found that time-lapse was the only medium that allowed us to convey the magnitude of the migration,' the photographer from Beaconsfield, Bucks, writes.

'It shows the migrating wildebeest crossing the Mara River while moving south into Tanzania from Kenya.'

The great migration: The herd travel over 3,000 kilometres every year

The 'great migration' is the world's largest migration of land mammals, which sees the mass movement of wildebeest. The herd travel 3,000 kilometres every year, in search of new grazing territory in March, and back south to give birth around October.

According to the Wildlife Photographer of the Year entry, 10,000 wildebeest can cross the Mara River in half an hour. It is estimated that up to 250,000 of the mammals perish during the migration every year, and the Mara crossing is the most dangerous part of the journey.

Burrard-Lucas writes about this experience and nine other incredible experiences in his free e-book 'My Top Ten Wildlife Experiences'.
