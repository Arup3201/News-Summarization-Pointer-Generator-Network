Jeffrey Hawkins, 49, stayed in a string of hotels over 20 years on other people's credit cards

A homeless man has spent the last two decades staying in hotels across East Coast of America using credit card numbers that he saw and memorised.

49-year-old Jeffrey Hawkins was only caught when he visited Disney's Coronado Springs Resort in Buena Vista, Florida and was arrested for trespassing.

He then told police he was 'sick of running' - and revealed how he had spent 20 years moving between hotels off the back of memorised card details.

County Sheriff's Officer Frank DelGuercio wrote in a police report: 
'At that time rather than speak about the trespassing Hawkins started 
speaking about credit card fraud.

"Hawkins then began to confess that he has been committing credit card fraud since the 90s.

'He stated that he has been homeless and jobless since then and has 
just been traveling the country using and obtaining other people's 
credit card numbers.'

According to ABC News, Hawkins is the suspect in 26 separate incidents 
of credit card fraud totaling over $18,000 at Disney alone - staying at Disney resorts 26 times.

Following his arrest on Tuesday, 
Hawkins said he was able to remember the details of credit cards after a
quick glance - and he would later write down the numbers and expiration
dates.

When officer's 
checked Hawkin's current room, they found credit card authorisation 
forms and the details of more than 100 credit cards.

ABC
reports that Hawkins has been charged with trafficking in stolen credit
cards, false statements, fraudulent use of credit cards and defrauding 
an innkeeper.

He is currently being held on a $2,900 bond.
