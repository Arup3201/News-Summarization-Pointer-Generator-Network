This is the moment a police officer kills a 22-year-old student in Brazil after leaning out of his patrol car and firing off 11 shots with his assault rifle as he thinks she is in a stolen vehicle.

Haissa Vargas Motta, 22, died soon after arriving at hospital, having been shot in the ribs during the incident. 

A camera in the cop car captured the amazing scenes on the streets of Nilopolis, near to Rio de Janeiro. 

Marcio Jose Watterlor Alves is now facing a murder trial.

Marcio Jose Watterlor Alves was captured on camera shooting at a car he wrongly believed to be stolen

But the car was not stolen, and was filled with a group of friends driving back from an evening at a concert hall in Brazil

The shots fatally wounded one of the girls, Haissa Vargas Motta, 22, who died shortly after arriving in hospital

He shouted 'stop' after firing off eight shots with his powerful weapon because the white Hyundai HB20 they were pursuing was a make of car that was often being stolen.

Haissa's distraught friends - who were returning from a concert hall - can be heard shouting out for help after one of the bullets pierced a back seat and hit her in the ribs.

Calm Alves, blamed for killing three people in four years as a police officer, insists: 'You don't do that', as one pal later sobs in the back seat of the patrol car with her head between her hands.

His patrol colleague then asks her why they didn't stop before admitting: 'Nothing justifies opening fire like that, okay?'

He go on to try to excuse his colleague's actions as they follow the car they had just shot at to hospital by claiming they had been previously been involved in a shoot-out with other vehicles and were feeling 'tense'. 

The video, which was released on Saturday, also captures the aftermath of the shooting - including the horrified reaction of Haissa's traumatised friends, who end up travelling in the back of the police car

The officers are heard questioning the friends on why the car didn't stop - the driver later revealed they thought the police were chasing a motorbike behind them

The male driver of the car Haissa was in told officers in a statement he didn't stop because he thought they were chasing a motorbike travelling behind them.

An investigation is ongoing into the actions of the officers, who have been put on gardening leave since the August incident.

MP Paulo Teixeira is one of the main backers of a new law which hopes to curb the number of people killed by police officers in Brazil - who are responsible for about 2,000 deaths each year

Security specialist Paulo Storani told a local paper: 'This shows a model of policing based on searching for criminals and not protecting honest citizens. 

'The use of lethal force is only justified when lethal force is used against police officers. This hasn't happened here at any point. 

'It was a mistake and a good example of how not to act.' 

Brazil's police are responsible for at least 2,000 deaths every year, and nearly 550 people were shot by police in the state of Rio alone last year. 

Figures from the Brazilian forum of Public Security NGO show on and off-duty Brazilian police officers killed 11,197 people in the five years to the end of 2013, compared to 11,090 people in the US in the past 30 years.

The victims are generally recorded as having been 'killed while resisting arrest'.  

A draft law currently going through Brazil's parliament is seeking to allow more scrutiny of these 'acts of resistance', which protect police who kill in the line of action, and pave the way for detailed probes of their actions.

A recent study discovered 60 per cent of 'acts of resistance' were false.

MP Paulo Teixeira, one of the main backers of the new law, said: 'They were shots to the neck, the back, from behind.' 

Alexandre Ciconello, a human rights adviser at Amnesty International Brazil, added: 'The Brazilian police is one of the forces that most kills in the world.'
