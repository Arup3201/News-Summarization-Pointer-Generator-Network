The build-up to Manchester United’s FA Cup quarter-final against Arsenal has inevitably rekindled memories of their epic encounter in 1999; Roy Keane’s sending-off, Peter Schmeichel’s penalty save and Ryan Giggs’ mazy, mesmerising winner followed by a shirt-stripping celebration.

United’s semi-final victory at Villa Park that night came to epitomise Sir Alex Ferguson’s Treble-winning team. The penchant for high drama. The never-say-die spirit that he instilled in his players. And a ‘we’ll score more goals than you’ attitude in going toe-to-toe with any opponent, be it Barcelona or Blackburn Rovers.

So as United prepare to face the Gunners again for a place at Wembley on Monday night, it’s perhaps understandable if their supporters are growing disillusioned by the brand of football being offered up by Louis van Gaal’s team.

It doesn’t seem to matter what tactics the Dutchman employs, the result seems to be the same. Whether it’s down to a three-man defence, a midfield diamond, or simply a case of launching high balls up to Marouane Fellaini, United simply haven’t been very entertaining this season.

There is a caution, a lethargy, to Van Gaal’s side at odds with the traditions of the club. The Manchester United way. Giggs espoused it when he was installed as caretaker manager for the final four games of last season.

‘It’s going to be my philosophy, Manchester United’s philosophy,’ said Giggs at the time. ‘I want players to play with passion, speed, tempo and be brave with imagination – all the things that are expected of a Manchester United player. United’s philosophy is to attack.’

No wonder the Old Trafford legend seemed a little underwhelmed as Van Gaal turned to him to celebrate a late 1-0 win over Newcastle last week.

Paul Scholes, Giggs’s former team-mate who joined him on the coaching staff for that brief stint last year, has described United’s football as ‘miserable’.

‘United’s history was built on attacking football, which does not always mean that the team kept clean sheets or did not concede chances,’ says Scholes. ‘To beat opposing teams you have to attack, and to attack you have to take risks. Too few of the players in the current team are prepared to take those risks.’

Ferguson’s teams did not always dazzle on the big stage, of course. The goalless 2005 FA Cup final against Arsenal ranks as one of the worst in recent memory, though largely due to the negative tactics employed by Arsene Wenger before his side won on a penalty shootout.

Equally, United’s 1979 final against the Gunners is lauded as one of the classics by those who sometimes forget that the first 85 minutes were pretty turgid.

Dave Sexton was in charge of United that day. His sacking two years later in 1981 was attributed to the fact that his team were just too boring even though United had just ended the season with seven straight wins, typically six of them by a one-goal margin.

It is a reminder that results are not always everything at Old Trafford as Van Gaal continues to build on an impressive record of just two defeats in 22 games.

Sexton paid the price for failing to play the United way; a cavalier style built on width and speed and a commitment to attack and entertain the fans.

‘All those lads you see going to the factory in Trafford Park, they come to watch you on Saturday,’ Sir Matt Busby told a teenage Bobby Charlton on his arrival at the club. ‘They have boring jobs, so you have to give them something they will enjoy.’

Tommy Docherty embraced Busby’s philosophy. Ron Atkinson too, though neither with the greatest success. When home attendances dropped to 33,000 during Ferguson’s darkest period in late 1989, it was largely down to a dreadful run of results that left United hovering above the relegation zone.

One could argue that United are not much worse to watch under Van Gaal than they were under David Moyes, with better results. But fans expect more from the £150million spent last summer and the names on the team sheet. They find it hard to take when Wayne Rooney is dropped into midfield, Fellaini goes up front, and Sam Allardyce of all people gets to label their team ‘Long Ball United’. In recent weeks, they have taken to urging their team to ‘attack, attack, attack’ and booed when the ball is passed back to David de Gea.

Van Gaal is understandably proud of the fact that he has won a trophy in his first season at each of his clubs. But as United aim to move a step closer to lifting the FA Cup for a record 12th time, he would do well to remember that style counts every bit as much as silverware at Old Trafford.
