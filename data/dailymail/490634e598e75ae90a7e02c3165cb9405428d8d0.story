Ed Miliband today challenged David Cameron to back a ban on MPs having lucrative second jobs to 'restore the reputation' of the Commons in the wake of the cash for access scandal.

Ahead of a vote tonight, the Labour leader told the PM: 'You can vote for two jobs or you can vote for one.'

But Mr Cameron has defended the right of MPs to do second jobs - insisting that extra work can be fitted in alongside constituency duties.

Ed Miliband today challenged David Cameron to back a ban on MPs having lucrative second jobs

A fresh row over second jobs erupted this week after revelations former foreign secretaries Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Jack Straw were filed by undercover reporters boasting about how they could be hired for £5,000-a-day.

Sir Malcolm announced he was suspended from the Tory party and forced quit as an MP after bragging that he could see any foreign ambassador in London and has 'useful access' to every British ambassador in the world.

Mr Straw was suspended by the Labour party after being filmed boasting about having laws changed 'under the radar'.

Commons Speaker John Bercow warned: 'People should not be in Parliament to add to their personal fortune.'

Labour is using a debate in the Commons tonight to force a vote on the issue, calling for a ban on MPs from holding directorships and consultancies.

The Labour leader recalled comments by Mr Cameron in 2009 when he said in opposition that 'being a Member of Parliament must be a full-time commitment

Mr Cameron claimed that it would still allow an MP to work as a paid trade union official.

But Mr Miliband hit back: 'Let's agree now we will rule out anyone being a paid trade union official, a paid director, or a paid consultant.

'Say yes and we can restore the reputation of this House.

'We will insert paid trade union official and you have the chance, and all of your MPs tonight in the lobby, this is a very big test.

'You can vote for two jobs or you can vote for one. I'll be voting for one job. What will you be voting for?'

The Labour leader recalled comments by Mr Cameron in 2009 when he said in opposition that 'being a Member of Parliament must be a full-time commitment. The public deserve nothing less ... double-jobbing MPs won't get a look-in when I am in charge'.

Mr Miliband said: 'What's changed?'

Mr Cameron replied: 'I think the difficulty with your specific proposal is it would allow, for instance, someone to be a paid trade union official but it wouldn't allow someone to run a family business or a family shop.

'Like many of your proposals, it is not thought through, it's whipped up very quickly, if you thought it was such a good idea, why didn't you put it in place four years ago?'

The Prime Minister said there was 'fundamentally a disagreement' between the two leaders, claiming he was the only one who believed Parliament benefited from having MPs with different experiences in the Commons.

'I make an offer to you: no more support from trade unions for the Labour Party and then we have got a deal.'

Mr Cameron pointed out that he spent more time on his duties as PM than on work linked to his seat in Witney, Oxfordshire.

'We have practising doctors in this House, we have practising dentists, we have people who take part serving our country in Afghanistan or Iraq and we do have people who run family businesses or have other interests,' the Tory leader said.

'What you want is a Parliament where people can come and share their experience and make some points instead of just having a whole lot of trade union-sponsored ciphers.'

Mr Cameron added: 'I think the most important thing we can do - and I certainly don't rule out further changes - but the most important thing is to make sure we apply the rules.

'Paid lobbying banned. Non-declaration of interests banned. Making sure wrongdoing is investigated and punished. We are not making no change - we have just passed a lobbying Act and we have just passed a recall Act so people can sack their MP.'
