The fiancee of murdered soldier Lee Rigby will get nothing from his £57,000 estate – because he failed to change his will after splitting from his wife.

Fusilier Rigby, who died of multiple stab wounds in the street outside Woolwich Barracks, wrote his will in  2008 before he deployed to Afghanistan.

At the time he was happily married to Rebecca Rigby, 30  – the mother of his two-year-old son Jack.

Loss: Lee Rigby was engaged to Aimee West, 22, at the time of his brutal murder, but she will not inherit anything from his £57,000 estate

But by the time of his murder, the 25-year-old from Middleton, Greater Manchester, was engaged to Royal Military Policewoman Aimee West, 22.

Miss West, from Feltham, Middlesex, was serving in Afghanistan when Fusilier Rigby was killed in May.

She was immediately flown back to Britain on compassionate grounds and was photographed tearfully placing a bouquet of flowers outside Woolwich Barracks  and being comforted  by colleagues.

Both Miss West  and Mrs Rigby attended the soldier’s military funeral at Bury Parish Church last month, although they kept a respectful distance from each other throughout the service.

Small compensation: Fusilier Lee Rigby's estranged wife Rebecca, mother of his son Jack, inherits him

Fusilier Rigby, a machine gunner in the 2nd Battalion,  the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was separated from his wife, but they had not divorced.

Rebecca,  from Halifax, West Yorkshire, was still nominated as his next-of-kin.

Michael Adebolajo, 28,  and Michael Adebowale, 22, have been charged with murder and  will stand trial at the Old Bailey in November.
