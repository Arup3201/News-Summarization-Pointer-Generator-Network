Louise McQuater from Tullibody, Clackmannanshire, has chocolate allergy which triggers asthma

When
 you tuck into those chocolate eggs this Easter, spare a thought for 
Louise McQuater. For even one tiny bite of chocolate could trigger her 
asthma and lead to a potentially life-threatening attack.

Most people
 think asthma is brought on by dust or pet fur, but there are many 
triggers for the characteristic coughing, wheezing, tightness in the 
chest and shortness of breath.

However, many of the 5.4 million 
Britons with asthma - and even some GPs - aren't aware of these, and 
failing to identify and then avoid their more unusual triggers could put
 them at risk.

Indeed, Louise, 41, never thought chocolate was making
 her asthma worse until December 2012, when her asthma consultant 
suggested she looked at her diet after a number of attacks.

'I ate 
chocolate every day so thought it might be a trigger and started cutting
 down,' says Louise, a school learning assistant who lives with her 
three children in Tullibody, Clackmannanshire.

'My asthma seemed to 
improve, although I still didn't really believe chocolate was a trigger 
because I'd never heard of that before.'

But a terrifying experience a few months later made her realise it was.

She'd
 given in to temptation and bought her favourite chocolate bar, a 
Galaxy. After the first bite, she started coughing but finished it all 
because her craving was so bad.

Her coughing worsened and she was 
struggling to breathe - even a reliever inhaler, which relaxes the 
lung's airways that can become inflamed in an asthma patient, didn't 
help. She went to an out-of-hours emergency doctor, who put her on a 
nebuliser, which gives high doses of reliever medicine through a mask or
 mouthpiece, easing her symptoms.

'I was astounded chocolate caused 
that reaction,' she says. 'Looking back, it's possible it played a part 
in other attacks I'd had.'

Since then, Louise, whose severe asthma is also triggered by dust mites, hay fever and mould, has avoided chocolate.

Patients
 who don't know all their triggers can risk asthma symptoms or attacks, 
says Deborah Waddell, clinical lead nurse at Asthma UK.

'Everyone's 
triggers are different and can be difficult to identify. It can take 
people years to understand their asthma. Sometimes this can be because 
their triggers are more unusual, such as chocolate, wine or fizzy 
drinks,' she explains.

'Potential triggers are all around us. Health 
professionals need to be open-minded when patients report what they 
think makes their  asthma worse.'

People whose asthma is triggered by chocolate may not be having a true allergic response

Patients' airways become inflamed 
in response to irritant triggers such as exercise, stress or cold 
weather, or allergic triggers such as pollen or dust mites.

Irritants
 make vulnerable airways inflamed and narrow. This leads to contractions
 of the muscle of the bronchi (the main airway of the lungs), causing 
breathlessness and other symptoms. With allergic ones, the immune system
 goes into overdrive and sees the harmless substance, which can be 
inhaled or ingested, as dangerous.

An antibody, immunoglobulin E 
(IgE), looks for the allergen and signals to the immune system to 
produce powerful chemicals including histamine, which cause inflammation
 and swelling in airways.Goblet cells, which produce mucus, are also
 set off. This results in thick, sticky mucus in the airways - one of 
the biggest problems during an attack is making huge amounts of mucus 
you can't clear, explains Ms Waddell.

Allergic asthma is often seen 
in people with a family history of atopy (predisposition to produce high
 amounts of IgE), including hay fever, eczema and food allergy, she 
adds.

Triggers can be identified through skin-prick tests, where a 
tiny amount of the suspected allergen is injected into the skin. A red, 
itchy bump larger than 3mm appearing after ten minutes confirms allergic
 sensitisation to that substance, says Dr Ramesh Kurukulaaratchy, a 
consultant respiratory physician at Southampton General Hospital.

Blood
 tests are also used, when blood is mixed with allergens and checked for
 IgE. But these only look for specific allergens and can give misleading
 results.

For suspected food allergy triggers, patients can take 
challenge tests, ingesting small amounts of the substance under medical 
observation. 'But access to allergy services is extremely limited across
 the UK,' says Dr Kurukulaaratchy. Some people find they have more 
triggers over time, while others may show a lessening of triggers.

However,
 Dr Kurukulaaratchy believes people whose asthma is triggered by certain
 foods such as chocolate are not having a true allergic response 
involving the immune system, but have been irritated by chemicals they 
contain known to aggravate some people's asthma.

'Chocolate is rich in organic compounds called amines that can provoke allergic-type reactions in some people,' he explains.

There
 are natural and artificial chemicals in other foods and drinks that 
could be triggers - for example, alcohol has naturally-occurring amines 
and salicylates, and preservatives like sulphate, which are not commonly
 regarded as triggers, but can lead to symptoms.

Mother-of-one 
Christina Nicol discovered at 18 that vodka was a trigger for her, and 
needed her reliever when it left her unable to breathe. 'Other types of 
alcohol don't trigger my asthma but when I've tried vodka since, the 
same thing happened, so I avoid it,' says the hotel receptionist, now 
38, from East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire.

Dr Kurukulaaratchy says 
salicylates (the active ingredient in aspirin) can be found in  herbs, 
spices and mint - so even toothpastes and mouthwashes may lead to 
symptoms.

Samantha Rawlings, 30, had an attack after using her 
mother's toothpaste instead of her own.

'Within an hour of using it I 
was in hospital,' says the pub manager from Bristol. 'The consultant 
said it was likely to be a chemical in the toothpaste.'

Unfortunately,
 there aren't validated tests for substances that provoke chemical 
sensitivities, so recognising patterns is vital, says Dr 
Kurukulaaratchy.

Being aware of triggers can also help because there
 are additional treatments for allergic asthma. One treatment, approved 
for UK use last year, is Xolair, an injection which tackles IgE. 'New 
treatments are being developed, so patients should receive more tailored
 treatment,' says Dr Kurukulaaratchy.

Drugs known as leukotriene 
antagonists, such as Singulair tablets, which block a chemical reaction 
that can cause inflammation in airways, can also be effective for 
allergic asthma, adds Dr Nazim Nathani, a consultant respiratory 
physician at BMI The Priory and City Hospital in Birmingham. 'As 
well as trying to avoid triggers, it's crucial to take your preventer 
inhaler (containing steroids) daily to build up protection - this should
 reduce the effect of triggers,' says Deborah Waddell.

People with 
asthma should think carefully about what may be triggering symptoms, 
adds Louise.

'They may need to think outside the box.'
