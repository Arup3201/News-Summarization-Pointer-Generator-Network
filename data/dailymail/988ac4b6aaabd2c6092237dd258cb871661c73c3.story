Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero may have an outstanding goal tally so far this season, but Barcelona boss Luis Enrique had no hesitations when asked who he feels is the best player in the world.

Following the Catalan giants' draw against City in the last 16 of the Champions League, Enrique was asked his thoughts on their free-scoring front man. 

'He's probably up there in the top ten or so players,' he said.

'But for me the number one is Leo Messi. Everyone else comes after him.'

Having netted an impressive 19 goals in 20 games before suffering an injury against Everton, Aguero is not far behind his compatriot, who has 21 goals in 21 games for Barcelona.

It's not the first time City will face Barcelona in the last 16 of Europe's most prestigious tournament, the Spanish side having eliminated Manuel Pellegrini's team at the same stage last season, winning 4-1 on aggregate.

That said, Enrique will not be getting carried away with past results.

'In principle (Manchester City) one of the hardest (teams) we could have faced,' he added.

'I am sure it will be a very hard match,' he added.

'The important thing in games like these is for us to be in good condition.

'If we're on form, we are good enough to cope with any competition. I always think positively, and I know we are quite capable of getting through the round against Manchester City.'
