A paedophile shakes hands with Jimmy Savile as two young children look on from the sofa next to him.

This image shows Keith Harding – a leading figure in the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) – appearing on Jim’ll Fix It in 1980.

And it has emerged that the antiques expert’s appearance on the show was ‘set up’ by Savile’s aides. 

Revealed: Paedophile Information Exchange member Keith Harding, right, was invited onto this 1980 Christmas special of Jim'll Fix It in a 'set-up' by production staff

Shamed: Harding was unmasked as an active member of the Paedophile Information Exchange and believed to be membership secretary of the group who wanted the age of consent lowered to four

Producers arranged for a family to write a letter to Savile as a pretext for inviting Harding – who was membership secretary of the notorious paedophile campaign group – on to the BBC show.

It is thought the appearance may have been part of a campaign by PIE, which campaigned for the age of consent to be reduced to four, to build links with influential public figures.

And it was allowed to happen despite Harding, who restored items for royalty, being convicted of child sex offences in the 1950s.

Savile has since been unmasked as one of Britain’s most prolific sex abusers and is thought to have assaulted hundreds of people between the ages of five and 75. 

Lawyers for Savile’s victims said the revelations were ‘extremely troubling’ and ‘suspicious’ and called for an investigation into Harding’s links to business and political figures.

Revealed: Harding was allowed access to children via his Cotswolds museum despite social services knowing about his convictions 

Harding was convicted of indecent assault against four children aged eight and nine in the late 1950s and was a ‘schedule 1’ offender – meaning his convictions remained on file for life. But he was later given the Freedom of the City of London.

The former chairman of the British Horological Institute also ran a museum regularly visited by children, despite social services being aware 20 years ago of his convictions for child abuse. He died aged 82 in June this year. 

Confidential social services documents seen by the BBC described his convictions as a ‘real cause for concern’ and warned that children should not be left unsupervised with him.

 But in December 1980, Harding appeared on Jim’ll Fix it after repairing a music box belonging to a 13-year-old girl at his London workshop.

She was then invited on to the show and filmed with her younger brother in the studio alongside Harding and Savile.

The girl’s brother Dean, now in his 40s, told BBC News the feature was ‘set up’ by the production team. 

He said: ‘The way it came about was that my uncle was asked by his then girlfriend, who was a researcher at the BBC, if anybody in the family had a music box. 

'Obviously the letter must have been done after the facts.’

Dean said that he and his sister were chaperoned throughout the programme and nothing inappropriate happened.

Richard Scorer, from law firm Slater & Gordon, which is representing nearly 200 alleged victims of Savile, said: ‘We know PIE had a very deliberate strategy of trying to build links with influential people. 

'The government inquiry needs to look into these links.’
