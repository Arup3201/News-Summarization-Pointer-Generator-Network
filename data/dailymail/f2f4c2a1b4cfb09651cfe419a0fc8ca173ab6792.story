Calais was at crisis point last night as French riot police prepared to raze a camp of East African migrants desperate to make their way to Britain.

Police vans patrolled the town ahead of the imminent crackdown as a court deadline for migrants to leave the illegal camp known as Jungle 2 expired.

It comes as the mayor of Calais called for a new Sangatte-style accommodation centre to be built.

The original was closed in 2002 after 
triggering a British immigration crisis.

Last night, tensions at the 
camp were at breaking point as water supplies were cut off and gendarmes
 prepared to move in to clear the 1,000 migrants living there.

Numbers have swollen in recent weeks as more and more people from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan make their way to the already crowded settlement and the surrounding countryside.

But aid workers last night criticised the planned raids, insisting that closing the camp would not deal with the problem if no alternative solution was proposed.

The Jungle 2 camp is situated on the edge of a busy road used by lorries heading to the cross-Channel ferry terminal on land used by a factory for non-toxic waste disposal. 

The migrants, who are mostly young men in their 20s, started camping out about three months ago. In recent weeks their numbers have increased.

The original Jungle, which was razed in 2009, housed almost 800 Afghans and Iraqi Kurds escaping war and persecution.

But the large majority of the latest wave of migrants come from Eritrea in east Africa with others from neighbouring Ethiopia and nearby Sudan.

Officially, there are 500 migrants at the illegal encampment, but numbers are more like 1,000 say observers.

Last Monday, a court in Calais gave the migrants seven days to quit – a deadline which expires this morning.

A pipe the migrants cut holes in to use as a water supply has also been cut off and they are now forced to rely on mineral water brought by aid workers. Authorities in Calais claim they are unable to deal with the huge numbers at the camp.

In an interview with a French newspaper last week, the mayor said the centre was needed to relieve pressure on the police. Natacha Bouchart has previously called for the border to be moved to Dover rather than Calais so Britain would have to deal with the migration. She has also called on Britain to take responsibility for the migrants and claims that they are attracted by our generous benefits system. ‘The economic development of Calais is affected by the presence of migrants at the port and in all other zones,’ she said.

The original Red Cross camp at Sangatte, which was home to 2,000 migrants, was shut down in 2002.

After the closure, Britain accepted hundreds of migrants in a deal with the French government but others were forced to move to a makeshift camp which became known as The Jungle. It was razed in 2009 and, since then, the mostly Afghans and Iraqi Kurds have had to occupy squats in the town and camps near the ferry terminal. In recent months, the French government has adopted a tough stance, razing camps and throwing migrants on to the street.

But an increasing number of East African arrivals who have flocked to the Jungle 2 camp have caused tensions to rise again.

There are also thought to be thousands living in makeshift camps in the French countryside, with settlements having sprung up as far away as the Belgian border.

Last night, aid workers insisted that police raids would not deal with the problem.

Jean-Claude Lenoir, of the charity Salam, which has been feeding the migrants, said: ‘It’s intolerable that these expulsions are being carried out without an alternative being proposed.’
