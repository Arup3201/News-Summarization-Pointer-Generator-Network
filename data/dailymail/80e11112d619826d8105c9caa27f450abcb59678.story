Researchers have discovered that an unassuming 5,000 year old ancient Egyptian artefact hides an incredible secret - it was made from a meteorite.

It is an important find as it explains how ancient Egyptians obtained iron millennia before the earliest evidence of iron smelting in the region, something that has confounded scientists until now.

It also unearths a tantalising glimpse of the genesis of the ancient Egyptians' religion and the divine attributes they attached to meteorites.

'The sky was very important to the ancient Egyptians,' says Joyce Tyldesley, an Egyptologist at the University of Manchester, UK, and a co-author of the paper on the discovery. 'Something that falls from the sky is going to be considered as a gift from the gods.'

Heaven-sent: The iron bead that unlocked the mystery surrounding the presence of iron among the ancient Egyptians. It also poses exciting questions about the way the cosmos influenced their religion

The evidence comes from strings of iron beads which were excavated in 1911 at the Gerzeh cemetery, a burial site approximately 70km south of Cairo.

Dating from 3350 to 3600 BC, thousands of years before Egypt’s Iron Age, the bead analysed was originally assumed to be from a meteorite owing to its composition of nickel-rich iron.

But this hypothesis was challenged in the 1980s when academics proposed that much of the early worldwide examples of iron use originally thought to be of meteorite-origin were actually early smelting attempts.

To settle the argument, Diane Johnson, a meteorite scientist at the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK, and her colleagues used scanning electron microscopy and computed tomography to analyse one of the beads, which they borrowed from the museum.

They found areas where the weathered surface had fallen away, providing what Johnson describes as 'little windows' to the preserved metal beneath, reports Nature.

The iron beads contained a unique 'fingerprint' that shows they are from a meteorite

The nickel content of this original metal was found to be high, suggesting that it did indeed come from a meteorite.

The researcher also observed that the metal had a distinctive crystalline structure called a Widmanstätten pattern. This structure is found only in iron meteorites that cooled extremely slowly inside their parent asteroids as the Solar System was forming.

Philip Withers, Professor of Materials 
Science at The University of Manchester, added: 'Meteorites have a 
unique microstructural and chemical fingerprint because they cooled incredibly
slowly as they travelled through space. It was really interesting to 
find that fingerprint turn up in Egyptian artefacts.'

Divine: The ancient Egyptians would have seen a meteorite as an offering from the gods

Ms Johnson said the research highlights the application of modern technology to ancient materials not only to understand meteorites better but also to help us understand what ancient cultures considered these materials to be and the importance they placed upon them.'

Meteorite iron had profound implications for the ancient Egyptians, both in their perception of the iron in the context of its celestial origin and in early metallurgy attempts.

Dr Tyldesley added: 'Today, we see iron first and foremost as a practical, rather dull metal. To the ancient Egyptians, however, it was a rare and beautiful material which, as it fell from the sky, surely had some magical/religious properties.

'They therefore used this remarkable metal to create small objects of beauty and religious significance which were so important to them that they chose to include them in their graves.'
