Police are searching for Russian gun store owner Alexey Obukhov after three people were found dead at an upscale New Hampshire home on Saturday 

Cops received a call about a dead woman in the home at about 1pm and found two more people dead when they arrived. 

Although police have said they are not looking for suspects, a 'be-on-the-lookout alert' was issued by National Emergency Alerts - New England at about 11.40pm on Saturday on Facebook.

The statement announced that they were looking for Obukhov and his maroon BMW coupe with New Hampshire plates.

Obukhov is the owner of a guns and ammo shop in Merrimack, which made headlines in 2013 after hanging pictures of President Barack Obama with Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong calling Obama 'firearm salesman of the year'.

He is also the owner of a company called New Vector Corporation, according to online records. He also is the president of Collectible Arms and Ammo II Corp.

Obukhov was previously arrested in August 2013 for a domestic violence assault but the charges were dismissed after his wife declined to testify, according to the Bedford Patch. 

National Emergency Alerts - new England, however, issued a 'be-on-the-lookout alert Saturday evening looking for a man named Alexey Obukhov

State and Bedford Police, along with a SWAT Team arrived on scene on Saturday. Police continued to investigate at the house throughout the day on Sunday

Then last year he filed a civil lawsuit against Bedford Police Chief John Bryfonski, seeking that all of his firearms and ammunition be returned to him

The lawsuit was denied, but Obukhov sued and in November, the state's highest court ordered that Obukhov's application for a pistol revolver license be granted even though Bryfonski believed that he was unsuitable to possess a concealed weapon, according to court records. 

New Hampshire State Police and SWAT vehicles were on the scene in Beford, blocking off the street and access to the home. The Attorney's General Office is also part of the investigation.

Additional counselors will be on hand at a local elementary school on Monday.

'This tragedy will affect all of us, and it will affect Riddle Brook School in particular,' Superintendent Chip McGee said in an email to parents of the Bedford School District on Sunday morning, reports Union Leader.

Very few details about the case have been released, and causes of death and names of victims are being withheld pending the notification of family

Police blocked off the road in Bedford where the Obukhovs allegedly lived for the remainder of Saturday

While reassuring the public that there is no threat to the community, McGee said the school district is coordinating with the National Alliance of Mental Illness and the Attorney General's Office Crisis Response Team. 

'Starting on Monday morning, we will have additional counselors at Riddle Brook School to work with those most affected. Counseling staff at all of our schools will be available to talk with students, parents and staff,' McGee said in his statement. 

'... This event will be known in our community, even among our children. Information travels fast. The event may trigger difficult memories and strong emotions in people.'
