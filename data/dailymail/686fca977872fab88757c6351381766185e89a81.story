Angel di Maria has given his first interview as a Manchester United player following his £60million British transfer record switch from Real Madrid.

The Argentina star has given United a boost during a troubled week in which they lost 4-0 to League One MK Dons.

He has also been getting familiar with his new surroundings, being pictured out and about in Manchester this week.

He - and the United fans - will hope he is in the squad to face Burnley on Saturday.
