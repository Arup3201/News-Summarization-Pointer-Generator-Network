When a fan fell ill after trying to make Delia Smith’s recipe for chilli con carne, he set off a celebrity feud that is continuing to simmer more than 30 years later.

Miss Smith has become embroiled in a war of words with former That’s Life! presenter Esther Rantzen over accusations that the cookery writer failed to warn readers to pre-boil kidney beans to make them safe to eat.

Miss Rantzen reheated the row this week by claiming she was ‘leaned’ on by her BBC bosses to apologise for broadcasting the claim in the consumer programme in the 1970s.

A viewer had written in to say he fell ‘terribly ill’ after trying out the chilli recipe in Delia Smith’s Cookery Course, a best-seller published by the BBC.

It was discovered that he had failed to cook the red kidney beans in Miss Smith’s recipe thoroughly enough. The beans need to be boiled for at least ten minutes to destroy high concentrations of lectin, a harmful toxin.

Recalling the incident this week, Miss Rantzen, now 73, said Miss Smith threatened to withdraw publication rights for the book from the BBC unless she received an apology.

‘At the time Delia was the biggest money-earner for the BBC,’ she said. ‘She was the Jeremy Clarkson of her day.

‘Her cookbooks were a huge money-earner for the BBC and she was about to launch another book, and I am told, and I don’t know if this is true, that she said to the BBC, “Unless That’s Life apologise I am going to take my book to another publisher”.

‘The bosses said I had to apologise. It was the most obscure apology you have ever heard. I am not sure we did not put it to music.

‘What we said was [the viewer] made the mistake … and we told viewers they would have to make sure [the beans] were cooked, and Delia changed her recipe. I think honour was preserved on both sides.’

Despite the passing of the years, Miss Smith, 72, remains furious over the suggestion that her recipe made the viewer ill. She also denied the suggestion that she had threatened to withdraw publication rights from the BBC.

She told the Daily Mail last night that Miss Rantzen’s remarks in the 1970s were ‘very damaging’ because her original cooking instructions were ‘perfectly safe’.

‘The recipe stated that the mixture should be brought up to simmering point in a flameproof casserole over direct heat, then transferred to a pre-heated oven,’ she said. ‘This meant the kidney beans did not come off the boil for two hours.

‘The one person who had complained to That’s Life! had not actually followed my recipe. The chilli had been made in a porcelain dish (ie not flameproof) and therefore placed in the oven cold.’

Miss Smith said there was ‘never any question’ of her withdrawing publication rights.

‘I have always assumed that it was the production team that finally realised they had acted irresponsibly and committed a libel, whatever Miss Rantzen thinks she now remembers,’ she said.

Delia Smith’s Cookery Course, which has been reprinted many times, now contains a clear warning on the importance of cooking kidney beans thoroughly.
