Newcastle United’s search for a new head coach is narrowing.

Sportsmail revealed on Monday that reports of eight-man shortlists were exaggerated and that a handful of potential successors to Alan Pardew were instead being considered.

Steve McClaren is the prime domestic-based candidate but the club are also looking to France with former Lyon boss Remi Garde the leading contender.

Here, we take a closer look at the two frontrunners for the St James’ Park hotseat…

Steve McClaren, on the touchline with Derby County, has guided the Rams to third in the Championship

STEVE McCLAREN

CURRENT POSITION: Derby County (manager)

PREVIOUS JOBS: Middlesbrough, England, FC Twente (twice), Wolfsburg, Nottingham Forest

HONOURS: League Cup (Middlesbrough), Eredivisie title (Twente)

REASONS FOR: McClaren has always had a reputation as a fine and respected coach, and that is what Newcastle want. He is level-headed and will not speak out against the regime, knowing how to handle the media. 

McClaren is admired within St James’ for the manner in which he has rebuilt his reputation after his failure with England and his knowledge of the Dutch and German leagues – he won the title in the former - is invaluable given United’s continental scouting model.

McClaren has previously managed Middlesbrough, England, FC Twente, Wolfsburg and Nottingham Forest

REASONS AGAINST: It would take a compensation payment to release him from Derby after he signed a new three-year deal in the summer. His somewhat dour demeanour would perhaps not appeal to some fans and his reputation within these shores remains a little tainted by his experience with England. Newcastle would also have to convince McClaren to quit promotion-chasing Derby.

FAN VIEW: His name has been fairly well received. One criticism of Pardew from the terraces was that the team lacked identity and, quite often, a game-plan. They see McClaren as more methodical with a greater emphasis on tactics.

Remi Garde quit as manager of Ligue 1 side Lyon at the end of last season and is currently without a club

REMI GARDE

CURRENT POSITION: Unemployed

PREVIOUS JOBS: Lyon

HONOURS: French Cup (Lyon) 

REASONS FOR: There would be no severance payment for starters given his decision to quit Lyon at the end of last season. His knowledge of Ligue 1 – Newcastle’s preferred hunting ground for new talent – is a big plus and he has the experience of 10 years at a top club in the roles of coach, assistant and manager. 

There is also no pre-existing relationships with the press, something Newcastle are keen to control, and he is familiar with the Premier League following three years as a player with Arsenal.

Former Lyon head coach Garde, who previously played for Arsenal, is in line for the Newcastle job

REASONS AGAINST: Garde cited family reasons and a lack of energy as the motivation behind his decision to stand down as Lyon boss. Has he had time to recharge his batteries? There is also the unknown element in Garde having never managed or coached outside of France.

FAN VIEW: It appears that Garde is well respected in his homeland and the Toon Army have spoken positively about the link. He also fits the the bill of continental head coach and this new model is something the Toon Army appear to have accepted.
