Massive underground ice explosions on Mars have created a unique set of twin craters, it has been revealed.

A passing European Space Agency spacecraft captured the 50km wide craters, named the Arima twins, in January.

They contain a unique central 'pit' formed by underground explosions, the space agency says.

The ‘twin’ craters are in the Thaumasia 
Planum region, a large plateau that lies immediately to the south of 
Valles Marineris, the largest canyon in the Solar System.

'Multiple terraces slump from the crater
walls onto a flat floor, but perhaps the most striking feature is the 
central pit, a feature it shares with Arima crater to its north,' said the agency.

Dramatic underground explosions, perhaps involving ice, are responsible for the pits inside these two large martian impact craters, which was imaged by ESA’s Mars Express spacecraft on 4 January.

Researchers say impact craters like these can provide windows into the past of a planet’s surface.

'In this case, they 
provide evidence for the Thaumasia Planum region having once hosted 
plentiful subsurface water or ice that was liberated during impact 
events both small and large,' it is claimed.

The craters were formed when an asteroid hits the rocky surface of a planet, and both it and the surface are compressed to high densities.

Immediately after the impact, the compressed regions rapidly depressurise, exploding violently. 

In low-energy impacts, a simple 
bowl-shaped crater results. In more dramatic events, larger craters are 
produced with more complex features, such as uplifted central peaks or 
sunken pits.

'One idea for central pit formation 
is that when rock or ice melted during the impact drains away through 
fractures beneath the crater, it leaves a pit,' said ESA.'Another theory is that subsurface ice is rapidly heated, vapourising in an explosion.

'As a result, the rocky surface is excavated forming an explosive pit surrounded by rocky debris.

'The pit is in the centre of the main crater, where most of the impact energy was deposited.'

Where is it? The area imaged on 4 January 2013 lies just south of the Coprates Catena region of Vallis Marineris, in the Thaumasia region of Mars

Though the large craters in this scene have similar diameters, their central pits are different in size and depth, as is clearly evident in the topographical map.

Compared to the Arima crater, perhaps more subsurface ice was present and more readily vapourised in the southern crater, punching through slightly thinner crust to leave a larger pit, ESA says.

Many neighbouring small impact craters also show evidence for subsurface water or ice at the time of impact as evidenced by their ‘rampart’ ejecta blankets.

Ejecta blankets are debris deposits surrounding the crater, excavated from inside the crater during its formation.

They have petal-like lobes around their edges: these result from liquid water bound up in the ejected material, allowing it to flow along the surface and giving it a fluid appearance.
