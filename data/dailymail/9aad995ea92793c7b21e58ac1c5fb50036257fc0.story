Violent lout: Michael Brown, 27, boasted that he ‘didn’t even get community service’ after his trial 

A violent lout did a jig outside court after being spared jail for beating his girlfriend.

Michael Brown, 27, boasted that he ‘didn’t even get community service’ after his trial. But his victim has accused the ‘soft’ judge who let him walk free of ruining people’s lives.

Her comments will heap further pressure on Judge George Moorhouse, who has already been accused of misconduct by three police and crime commissioners.

They have highlighted a number of cases in which he has failed to send domestic abusers to prison, claiming that such decisions can force victims into hiding.

Ceri Daniel, 24, suffered head injuries and cuts all over her upper body after being punched and kicked by Brown in January.

The terrified victim said the judge’s failure to jail the attacker after the trial in July left her with no choice but to flee her home town, as she was so petrified of meeting him.

She said: ‘Judge Moorhouse ruins people’s lives without even knowing he is doing it. He should not be a judge at all. He makes the victims prisoners, not the perpetrators.’

Miss Daniel was beaten after inviting her former partner of seven years to her house. During the attack, he also assaulted two of her friends.

He pleaded guilty to three counts of assault and was given a three-month suspended sentence, put on a domestic violence programme and told to pay £550 compensation to his victims.

But Miss Daniel said her ex, the father of her two children, had been left thinking ‘the justice system is a laugh’. She added: ‘There is no justice, no deterrent.

‘My life has been turned upside down, while Michael’s has carried on as normal.’

Judge George Moorhouse, who has been criticised by victims for the 'soft sentences' he imposes

Speaking about her decision to leave her home town of Middlesbrough, she said: ‘He lived close by and I was petrified of bumping into him. I became a prisoner in my own home.’

The case is one of a number of trials in which it is alleged that Judge Moorhouse, who sits at Teesside Crown Court, has ‘failed to deliver justice for the public’.

Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird and fellow commissioners Barry Coppinger and Ron Hogg in Cleveland and Durham have compiled a dossier of suspect cases.

The trio have called for the judge to be investigated and written to the Judicial Appointments and Conduct Ombudsman to complain.

They were driven to act following the trial of Anthony Bruce, 34, who was given a mere 12-month suspended sentence after beating his wife, holding a knife to her throat and shooting her in the foot with a pellet gun.

Their accusations were initially rejected by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office, which said there was no evidence of misconduct and that it could not look at sentencing issues.
