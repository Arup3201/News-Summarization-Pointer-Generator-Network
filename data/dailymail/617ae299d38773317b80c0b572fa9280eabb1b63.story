Daniel Morcombe’s killer Brett Peter Cowan will appeal his murder conviction in a hearing next month.

However, the attorney general will also appeal Cowan’s sentence at that time, arguing that 20 years non-parole is ‘manifestly inadequate’ for Cowan’s crime, which could see the 45-year-old’s prison time extended.

In March, Cowan was found guilty of murder, indecent treatment of a child and interfering with a corpse, after abusing and killing Daniel in an abandoned house after abducting the teen from a Sunshine Coast bus stop.

A covert police operation culminated in Cowan’s arrest in August 2011, after Cowan unknowingly confessed to Daniel’s murder on camera to an undercover detective.

Cowan’s defence will now claim that showing his video confession was illegal, with Cowan’s lawyer arguing ‘they should never have been played to the jury’.

The appeal will be heard on November 27 and 28.

The defence is reliant on a Canadian precedent, which saw a convicted murderer re-trialled after the jury was shown his confession video in the High Court trial.

‘Really the centre-point of the whole argument is the admissions that Brett made to the undercover officers should never have seen the light of day,’ Cowan’s lawyer, Tim Meehan told Nine News.

‘If that evidence is out, the case against Brett becomes particularly weak.’

Mr Meehan says that Cowan, currently in isolation at maximum security prison Wolston Correctional Service, is in good spirits due to his upcoming appeal.

‘He’s very happy that he’s got a date, he’s very keen for the appeal to run.’

‘It could change his life incredibly if he got a retrial.

Daniel’s parents, Denise and Bruce Morcombe, desperately searched for their son for almost eight years before Cowan’s arrest.

They are not concerned, telling Nine News that they were prepared for Cowan to appeal his conviction.

‘To be honest, we’re quite comfortable with the appeal process, we knew it was always going to happen,’ said Bruce Morcombe.

They are also not concerned with the precedent at the Canadian High Court, maintaining that international rulings ‘bear no relevance’ on proceedings in Australia.

The Morcombes are preparing for the 10th annual Day for Daniel on Friday, a day held to raise awareness about child safety and educating children so they know how to protect themselves.

Cheeky boys: Bradley Morcombe (left) and twin brother Daniel as young boys. In 2003 at the age of 13, Daniel, was abducted and murdered although his family did not know what had happened to him until his remains were uncovered in 2011 after a long police investigation and the family was able to lay him to rest. Bradley said of his twin this year, there had not been a day since that he hadn't thought of him

When Cowan was imprisoned, he had special food requests such as Coco Pops rejected, but in his cell he has his own TV, radio, toilet and shower.

He will be kept in solitary confinement during his time inside purely for his own protection from prison inmates. 

In some cases, according to prison staff, Cowan requires high level escorts when he leaves his cell to guard him down the halls during weekly visits to the doctor. 

He visits a gym, a concrete room with a single sun-drenched window, which is the only time he ever gets to see life life outside. 

Bruce Morcombe said he knows Cowan would be doing it tough, and quite frankly, didn't care much for his treatment behind bars. 

In a message to Cowan, Mr Morcombe told the father of three neither he nor his wife 'feel sorry for sorry him.' 

'Suck it up,' he said.
