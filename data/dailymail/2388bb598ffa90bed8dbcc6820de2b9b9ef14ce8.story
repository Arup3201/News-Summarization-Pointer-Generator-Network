Backbench Tory MPs have been ordered by their party’s hierarchy to stop attacking the Prime Minister on Twitter.

They were urged to exercise more caution when tweeting to avoid damaging the Conservatives’  general election prospects.

Tory strategist Lynton Crosby met MPs last night with David Cameron to discuss their tactics for the 2015 poll.

Ticking off: Tory MPs are to be told to stop speculating on Twitter about David Cameron's chances of wining the next election

Backbenchers were told to refrain from criticising the party’s policies and leadership in the wake of the disastrous Eastleigh by-election which saw the Tories relegated to third behind UKIP.

No 10 has reminded MPs that they are ‘participants, not commentators’ after a string of tweets were seen as ‘distracting’.

MPs were told instead ‘to get out the message that we have created one million extra private sector jobs, that net migration has reduced by a third and that crime is down. These messages are being drowned out.’

One of the MPs who regularly criticises Downing Street on Twitter is Dr Sarah Wollaston.

Help or hindrance? Totnes MP Sarah Wollaston and Lichfield MP Michael Fabricant are among the Tory backbenchers to use Twitter to criticise the party leadership

Within two hours of MailOnline reporting on the warning from No 10 to Tory MPs that they are 'participants not commentators', Dr Wollaston took to Twitter to insist she would not be silenced, including the message: **** ***

Dr Wollaston then deleted the message, and reposted it without the asterisks

When Home Secretary Theresa May made a 
speech over the weekend that was widely seen as a leadership pitch, Dr 
Wollaston reinforced the idea that Mr Cameron was in trouble.

She tweeted that the No 10 ‘inner circle
still look far too posh, male and white’ adding that ‘Cameron is 
running out of time to fix it’. On Monday night, she tweeted: ‘We don’t 
need a leadership challenge but I would challenge the leader to change 
his advisers.’

Tory election guru Lynton Crosby will tell MPs that they must focus on key messages like job creation and reforming welfare

Then after word got out that Tory MPs 
were encouraged to stop tweeting criticism of the PM, Dr Wollaston 
tweeted the message ‘**** ***’.

Former whip Michael Fabricant is another prolific tweeter.

The MP was openly discussing his party’s
problems during the Eastleigh by-election, tweeting that many of the 
policies trumpeted by UKIP were Tory ideas but voters did not realise 
this ‘because of mixed messaging’.

The PM has become a late convert to Twitter, following his pronouncement
in 2009 that ‘too many tweets might make a t**t’.

Now officials at Tory
HQ are encouraging MPs to follow his Twitter messages.

When Mr Cameron 
tweets, they are urged to retweet the message to their own followers.

Last night Labour vice-chairman Michael Dugher said: ‘Things are so bad 
for Cameron that he is reduced to gagging his own backbench MPs on 
Twitter because he’s fearful that they might tell it how it is.

‘This is a weak and increasingly out of touch prime minister desperately trying to stop his divided party imploding.’

But Tory MP Eleanor Laing said: ‘There are some people who are openly 
talking about challenges to the leadership. They should all be quiet.’

Mark Pritchard questioned why Mr Cameron had taken so long to 'catch up' with backbench opinion on Europe

Peterborough MP Stewart Jackson, a frequent critic of Mr Cameron, urged the PM to realise more right-wing policies would be popular

While his colleagues post a stream of comments online, the PM uses his account for more mundane messages, like this one from a visit to Mercedes-Benz in Buckinghamshire yesterday
