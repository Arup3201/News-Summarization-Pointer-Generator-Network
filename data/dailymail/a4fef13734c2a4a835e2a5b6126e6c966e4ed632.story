It may look like a gateway in to another world, but these are the incredible images of a ghostly white fogbow.

The rare phenomena was spotted by Mikhail Baevsky during a recent expedition to Chatyr-Dag mountain region, in Crimea, Southern Ukraine.

Mr Baevsky was part of a trekking group in the mountainous region when he spotted the watery apparition. He was stunned to see it was completely white and quickly grabbed his camera to capture the moment.

Ghostly: The phenomena appears in mist or fog and appears devoid of colour due to the effect of diffraction

The 61-year-old, from Russia, said: 'I often visit the mountain range in search of the perfect image.

'When I spotted the rainbow it felt really surreal. I am a scientist and I do understand the physics of all these processes but when you are high in the mountains and there are only clouds below you and this white rainbow in front of you it's like looking at a gateway to another world.

'I feel stunned and amazed by nature's diversity and beauty, that's why I can't stop going to mountains, it's full of so many amazing photo opportunities.'

A fog bow made from the same configuration of sunlight and moisture as a rainbow, but is made up by far smaller water droplets, which are less than 0.05mm across.

This means they are too small to refract light in the same way as in raindrops, which creates the multi-coloured effect. With a fogbow the diffraction (bending and spreading out of light waves) dominates, which robs the bow of its colour making it look white and washed out.

Fogbows are frequently seen over Arctic waters and are called sea-dogs by mariners, but they have also been spotted in mountain regions.

Despite sub-freezing temperatures - 
sometimes plummeting as low as -15 degrees - keen photographer Mr 
Baevsky, who also teaches chemistry at a university, spends most weekends climbing the mountain range in search of 
the perfect image.

Fogbows and rainbows are both made combining sunlight and water

However, fog has smaller water droplets than rain. This means light is diffracted (bent and spread out) which robs the resultant bow of its colour
