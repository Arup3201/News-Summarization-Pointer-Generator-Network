A motorist who was Tasered and then allegedly beaten and injured by police officers during his arrest has died more than three months after the incident.

Martin Baskeyfield, 44, was rushed to hospital three days after his arrest in September, and remained there until last Monday, when he died.

He was Tasered by a 50,000-volt gun, and was said by a friend to have been beaten by baton-carrying police officers.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which was already investigating the ‘police use of force’ during  his arrest, is also looking into his death, which has raised questions about the use of Tasers.

Sophie Khan, a lawyer campaigning against Tasers, said: ‘Taser use must be limited and occur only when suspects have weapons, not at any other time.’

Unemployed Mr Baskeyfield, from Stoke-on-Trent, was arrested after a chase for allegedly speeding and driving without insurance or a licence.

An IPCC spokesman said:  ‘The IPCC is investigating the arrest of Mr Baskeyfield. A Home Office post mortem is being conducted to determine the cause of death and the coroner has been informed.’

Equipment: A Taser gun capable of administering a 50,000-volt jolt, the level of power used against Mr Baskeyfield
