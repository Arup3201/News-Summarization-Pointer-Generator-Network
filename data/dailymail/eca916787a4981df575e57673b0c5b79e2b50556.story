Three cops who posted a picture of their Portland Police Department’s badge and a banner across it that said, ‘I am Darren Wilson’ were ordered to remove the images from their personal Facebook pages.

In a statement released on Monday, police chief Mike Reese said he had ordered the removal of the image once he had been alerted to what the officers had done.

‘The image displayed does not represent this organization and was very inflammatory in nature,’ he said.

Reese also said officers have the right to express their own personal opinion, ‘but not using an official badge of the Portland Police Bureau.’

The officers who posted the controversial image have been named by Oregon Live as Rich Storm, Rob Blanck and Kris Barber.

Oregon Live reported that Storm still had his badge post on his page as of 12:36 p.m., which drew 'likes' from 30 others, many of whom are Portland police officers.

Reese has asked the Professional Standards Division to review this matter for possible policy violations.

Portland Mayor Charlie Hales also issued a statement in which he accused the officers of ‘making a political statement’ by altering the city's official badges.

‘Chief Reese did the right thing by immediately ordering the officers to remove these symbols, and by ordering Professional Standards Division to review this matter for possible policy violations,’ Hales said in the statement.

The mayor added, 'Recently, police participated in specific dialog related to possible reactions to the upcoming release of a verdict from the grand jury in Ferguson, Mo.

'The actions taken by these three officers here in Portland do not help get us to that goal.'

The August 9 shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson by Officer Darren Wilson inflamed tensions in the predominantly black St. Louis suburb that is patrolled by an overwhelmingly white police force. 

As Brown's body lay for hours in the center of a residential street, an angry crowd of onlookers gathered. 

Rioting and looting occurred the following night, and police responded with armored vehicles and tear gas.

Protests continued for weeks - often peacefully, but sometimes turning violent, with demonstrators throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails and police firing smoke canisters, tear gas and rubber bullets.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon traveled to St. Louis from the Capitol on Monday in advance of the grand jury announcement. He was to speak with St. Louis-area clergy on a conference call and then hold a news conference at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.

Pastors were planning a rally and prayer service later on Monday at the West Side Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency in Ferguson and called in National Guard troops to back up police, which protesters have criticized as heavy-handed

'There's a lot of hurt, a lot of brokenness. There's anger and frustration on every side,' said the Rev. Ronald Bobo Sr., the church's pastor. 'We need the hand of God to lead us and guide us.'

The 12-person grand jury has been meeting in secret for months, hearing evidence from a wide variety of witnesses as it decides whether Wilson's should face charges that could range from involuntary manslaughter to murder. The grand jurors could decide not to charge Wilson at all.

At the lower end of the possible charges is second-degree involuntary manslaughter, which is defined as acting with criminal negligence to cause a death. It is punishable by up to four years in prison. 

The most serious charge, first-degree murder, can be used only when someone knowingly causes a death after deliberation and is punishable by either life in prison or lethal injection.
