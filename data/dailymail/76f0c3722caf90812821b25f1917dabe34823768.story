A skier who survived an avalanche in Colorado managed to capture the thrilling ride on camera.

Lance Light is lucky to be alive after he triggered the snowslide while skiing off-piste this weekend.

The video of his dangerous ride was filmed with a camera mounted on his helmet, and shows how Mr Light finds himself in the middle of the avalanche, but manages to stay on the surface thanks to his airbag.

Dangerous game: Lance Light managed to film himself as he was caught in an avalanche - and survived

The video shows Mr Light embarking on a backcountry ride down the Berthoud Pass in the Rocky Mountains, despite reports of a heightened risk of avalanches.

The snowslide is set off by Mr Light and comes down with full power as he jumps off a cliff.

The view is obstructed as the mass of snow encompasses  Mr Light, with only the tip of his skis visible.

Fortunately Mr Light was wearing a backpack airbag designed to aid skiers caught in avalanches, but he says the outcome could have been very different for someone who would not have been prepared.

Final breath: Mr Light jumps off the cliff and heads straight into the avalanche, triggered by his movements down the slope

'I saw it fracture and I just tried to straight line it over the cliff and instantly deploy my air bag,’ Light told KCNC-TV.

‘The road was only 300 yards away and there were tons of people up there snowshoeing and having a good time that don’t have any beacons, that don’t have any avalanche gear.’

‘Maybe I was in a little bit more of a risky zone, obviously, but it just shows that a lot of things can slide with not a lot impact on them and they can go big right now,’ Light said.

Saved by the bag: Just as Mr Light is about to be buried in the snow, he inflates his backpack-airbag, which brigs him to the surface

Avalanche airbags are designed for off-piste skiers and mountain climbers who risk finding themselves in such conditions.

The airbag resembles an airplane life vest and is hidden inside the skiers backpack.

As large objects rise to the surface of an avalanche, inflating the airbag helps prevent the skier from being buried in the snow.
