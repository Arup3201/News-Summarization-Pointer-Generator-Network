An animal-loving grandmother died from a rare infection after she was licked on the hand by her pet dog.

Sheena Kavanagh, 53, went into septic shock when her dog's saliva entered her bloodstream through a small cut and was rushed to Stafford Hospital.

It is believed an affectionate lick from either of her Yorkshire Terriers or her Jack Russell proved fatal because her spleen – the organ which prevents bacterial infection – was removed in 1988, an inquest heard.

She became ill in April after finishing work at a care home where she was a chef.

The mother-of-two was rushed to hospital where medics suspected she had bacterial meningitis but the results were not clear.

She was prescribed antibiotics but her condition deteriorated and she died at about 9.30pm the following night after her organs shut down.

The inquest at Cannock Coroner’s Court heard that death was so unexpected doctors were unable to pinpoint what had caused it at first.

Due to its rarity, clinicians are now considering publishing a report on the case.

Ms Kavanagh from Hilderstone, 
Staffordshire, was unaware she was at risk from capnocytophaga 
canimorsus – an organism present in dog saliva - after her spleen was 
removed.

The organism Capnocytophaga Canimorsus is typically found in the saliva of cats and dogs.

It has the low ability to cause disease in healthy individuals but has been known to cause severe illness in people with pre-existing conditions.

Its transmission can occur through bites, licks or even close proximity to animals.

Symptoms usually appear within one to eight days of exposure, but mostly on the second day, and can range from flu-like symptoms to fulminent septicemia.

Infection can usually be treated effectively with antibiotics and is recommended for a minimum of three weeks.

The faster the infection is diagnosed the better the chance of survival, but death is rare.

The operation was carried out she was assaulted by her then partner in 1988, although at the time she told doctors she had sustained the injuries in a car crash.

She escaped the relationship three years later, and her former partner died in 2001.

Her daughter Melissa Bromfield, 27, told the hearing her mother had been prescribed penicillin as is standard practice after a splenectomy until five years ago to reduce the risk of contracting the illness.

She added that her mother, who also has a son, James, 23, had been taking the antibiotic twice a day right up until her death.

Pathologist Dr Hiam Ali told the inquest, held yesterday, that the bacteria which proved fatal was discovered in a blood sample taken shortly after Ms Kavanagh arrival at hospital.

Dr Ali said: ‘She had antibiotics [in hospital] which worked on the bacteria but unfortunately the damage was already done.

‘Her blood was full of bacteria and organisms.

‘Capnocytophaga canimorsus, an organism present in dog saliva, normally doesn't cause damage.

‘But in people without a spleen it can cause death due to septic shock. But it is extremely rare.’

Dr Ali added that a 'very small' cut had been found on her hand.

She was rushed to Stafford Hospital but died the next night after her organs began shutting down

He added that he would have expected that the penicillin she regularly took would have protected her from the bacteria entering her bloodstream and was unsure why it had not.

South Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh recorded a narrative verdict that Ms Kavanagh died from 'splenectomy and dog saliva in bloodstream'.

Speaking after the hearing, her daughter said: ‘It was a shock as she had been around dogs all her life.

‘She had two Yorkshire terriers, a long haired Jack Russell and six horses, she loved all animals.

‘She was brilliant, a devoted nan and my best friend rather than my mum. I saw her almost every day.

‘She loved her job and everyone misses her dearly.

‘There is a massive part of our family missing.’
