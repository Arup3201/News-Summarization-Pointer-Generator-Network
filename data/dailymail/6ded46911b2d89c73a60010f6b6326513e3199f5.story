The recently concluded investigation into Newtown killer Adam Lanza revealed that a psychiatrist who treated him as a teen has since surrendered his license.

Dr. Paul Fox once held licenses to practice in Connecticut and New York but in 2012 he gave them both up in the face of charges he may have crossed a line in his relationship with a patient.

Investigators reached Fox in New Zealand, where he now lives, in a telephone interview told detectives all he remembered about the cold-blooded killer.

Killer: Lanza saw Dr. Fox during part of his adolescence up until he was about 15 years old. Fox recalls little about the killer, but says he had 'aggression problems' and possibly Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autism

According to the Danbury News Times, Fox was cited for 'negligence on more than one occasion' and 'possible boundary violations' with an unidentified patient.

Instead of facing the shaming and scrutiny of a full-fledged investigation into the matter, Fox voluntarily surrendered his license in both New York State and Connecticut.

Fox was Lanza's primary psychiatrist during much of his adolescence, but had trouble recalling many details when investigators called him following the horrifying attack on Sandy Hook Elementary in December 2012.

He said he vaguely remembered Lanza, who was 15 when he last saw him.

Revelations about Dr. Fox's time treating Lanza came as the investigation into the Sandy Hook massacre concluded last week, along with painful photos like these taken from the scene of Lanza's unthinkable crimes

Unthinkable: A year after Sandy Hook, newly released photos make the horror that took place the day Lanza killed 20 children and 6 adults and details like those provided by Dr. Fox provide little insight into why the 20-year-old did such a thing

'[He] recalls Adam having aggression problems and possibly having been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome,' reads the state police report. 'He recalled Adam as very rigid and resistant to engagement. He was unable to provide any further details concerning Adam.'

Authorities have given no indication that Lanza is one of the patients whose relationships with Dr. Fox were suspect.

The psychiatrist and his wife of nearly 25 years filed for divorce just a month before Fox surrendered his license.

He now lives in New Zealand, where he works in a 'child social services,' according to the Stamford Advocate.

Fox has so far declined to speak out on his time as Lanza's mental health caregiver.Â
