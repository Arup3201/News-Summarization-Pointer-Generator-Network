Shock jock Howard Stern is causing a stir again - this time after ridiculing star of the moment Lena Dunham's looks and saying sex scenes in the series Girls are like rape.

Cashing in on the publicity of the show's new series, Stern decided to make Dunham the target of his ire on his radio show this week.

He said the writer and star of the series was 'a little fat girl' who looks 'kinda like Jonah Hill' before he promptly dismissed the acclaim awarded to the hit show.

Outspoken: Shock jock Howard Stern, left, used his radio show to air his views on the hit-show Girls and to ridicule the looks of the main star Lena Dunham, right. Fans have hit back at the 59-year-old, calling him a 'bully'

'It's a little fat girl who kinda looks like Jonah Hill and she keeps taking her clothes off and it kind of feels like rape. She seems -- it's like -- I don't want to see that,' Stern said.

The 59-year-old also criticized the show
 for focusing too much on the exploits of Dunham's character Hannah 
Horvath. He says he was introduced to the show by his wife Beth Ostrosky
 but has obviously watched enough to become acquainted with the format.

'I learned that this little fat chick 
writes the show and directs the show and that makes sense to me because 
she's such a camera hog that the other characters barely are on.'

'My opinion, if I was a producer on 
that, I'd say, 'Honey, you're a little too close to the project. You 
need to allow the other characters to breathe a little and let us get 
invested in them,' he continued. 

'Good for her. It's hard for little fat chicks to get anything going.'

Non-plussed: Girls star Lena Dunham was unmoved by Howard Stern's comments ridiculing her looks and criticizing the hit show

Unfortunately for Stern,  26-year-old Dunham is also the show's producer but she said she had no hard feelings against the America's Got Talent judge.

'I did find out that Howard Stern really hates [Girls]. I'm a Howard Stern fan, and really think he has earned the right to free speech and he should just go for it," she told David Letterman on the Late Show Thursday.

'But he did say something that is so funny that I wanna get it on my gravestone: 'Congrats to her 
(Dunham). It's so hard for little fat chicks to get anything going these
 days',' she said 'I want my gravestone to say, 'she was a little fat chick and she got it going'.

Letterman then joked: 'I think that's the essence of life's struggle,
 isn't it? Before you go to bed tonight, before your head hits the 
pillow, please consider little fat chicks and how hard it is to get 
things going.'

Hit: The award-winning series Girls returns to HBO tonight. Howard Stern has criticized it but his comments were laughed off by director and star Lena Dunham

Runaway success: Girls was a major hit in its first series. Fans turned on radio-host Howard Stern who criticized it this week while others joined in ridiculing the popular program

Although she clearly doesn't need any back-up, fans of the show have since turned on Stern branding him a bully. 

Several also pointed out he isn't male model material himself.

One woman wrote on Twitter: 'Howard Stern talking about not liking 'little fat chicks' on t.v. is bizarre, since he has a face only radio could love.'

Celebrity trainer, Tracy Anderson told USWeekly: 'He’s, like, literally desensitized himself so much over the years. That guy 
doesn’t know what’s sexy. What is sexy is the way that Lena 
exposes herself, exposes her soul, wears her heart on her sleeves and is so 
freaking confident — that’s sexy.'

Others said his comments were 'hilarious' and that he was a 'legend' for turning on the popular program.

The second season of Girls starts on HBO tonight.
