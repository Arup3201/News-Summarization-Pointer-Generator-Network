Sisters Maxine Preston and Dawn Larkin have been enjoying Mother's Day with their twin daughters - born on the same day three years apart and delivered by the same doctor.

The mothers, who also have husbands called Paul and work as market traders, made headlines in 1995 when Mrs Larkin gave birth to Louise and Charlotte.

The babies were born one week early at Solihull Hospital in Birmingham, but exactly three years after Mrs Preston gave birth to Nicky and Shelley at Birmingham Maternity Hospital.

Sheer coincidence: Maxine Preston (left) and Dawn Larkin (right) in 1995 with Shelly and Nicky, aged three, and newborn Louise and Charlotte, who this year celebrated their respective 21st and 18th birthdays together

By sheer coincidence, the four girls were delivered by the same consultant and have recently been celebrating their respective 21st and 18th birthdays together with a fancy dress party.

Mrs Preston, 49, who lives in Northfield, Birmingham, with her 54-year-old husband said: 'Dawn and I are very close.

'I couldn't believe it when she told me she was having twins too. She'd only had a little boy the year before.

'Mine were three weeks early, her's were one week early - but both arrived on the same day. I was with Dawn at Solihull Hospital when she was having the twins.

'When the same consultant who delivered mine at Birmingham Maternity Hospital three years earlier walked into the room I nearly fainted. Dawn's twins were born at noon, mine at 9pm.'

Mrs Larkin, 46, from Arley, north Warwickshire, said: 'After my girls were born, we both said, 'what an amazing party they will have for their 18th and 21st birthdays'. It has been arranged from birth.'

We are family: Louise and Charlotte were delivered by the same consultant as cousins Shelly and Nicky

Their party was at Harborne Golf Club in Birmingham with 150 family and friends. Every year Shelley signs her cousins' birthday cards with the same joke: 'I hope you enjoy my birthday.'

Mother-of-three Mrs Larkin said: 'Louise and Charlotte dressed up as the blokes in the 118 118 ad.

'When they walked in, everyone laughed as they are quite pretty girls but they were wearing wigs and moustaches.

'Nicky dressed up as a clown. She looked amazing. My mum bought a '21' shaped cake and an '18' shaped cake for the twins. They all had a fantastic time.'

Louise and Charlotte are both studying A-levels at Cockshut Hill College in Garretts Green.

Cousin Nicky is hoping to enroll on a sports course, while twin Shelley, who has mild special needs, is recovering from a recent bout of illness.

Mrs Preston, who runs a pet supplies business with husband Paul, 48, and son Thomas, 19, added: 'Our girls are like chalk and cheese - and so are Nicky and Shelley.

Generation game: Maxine Preston and Dawn Larkin with their twin daughters and mother Beryl Morris (middle)

'Louise is doing A levels in cookery, travel and tourism and business studies; Charlotte is studying maths, business studies and psychology.

'Louise is very outgoing and bubbly, while Charlotte is very studious and gets on with her work.

'We were surprised as you think twins will be similar. They don't even look like sisters - one is light-haired and the other dark-haired.

'I did not expect to have twins. When I went for my scan, it was a shock and my sister cried her eyes out. It is hard work when they are babies. It's amazing now.

'We are part of a big family yet Maxine and I are the only ones of this generation to have twins. They have been a big support for me.'

The sisters were expecting a Mother's Day surprise from their 'thoughtful daughters', who were born on February 27, with Mrs Larkin hoping Lousie would put her baking skills to good use.

But they added that they have been so busy organising the twins' birthday patry that they had not had time to think about it.

Strange but true: Sisters Dawn Larkin and Maxine Preston also both have husbands called Paul

The sisters were planning to visit their own mother, Beryl Morris, who lives in Woodgate Valley, near Harborne, Birmingham.

Mrs Larkin, Mrs Preston and their younger sister Lisa Hassall followed Mrs Morris into the market trade, with their mother, who has retired, setting up her business in 1972.

Mrs Preston said: 'Our mum is absolutely wonderful and always helped us. My sisters and I are all market traders like she was.

'She's had quite a rough time lately - last year we lost our youngest sister, Tina who was 36. She had a rare cancer and had been ill for six of seven years.

'Mum then looked after her older sister, who was 85, for six months but she died recently.

'After her death, Mum decided she was going to go away for a break, but on her first day in Egypt she fell and broke her hip and leg.'
