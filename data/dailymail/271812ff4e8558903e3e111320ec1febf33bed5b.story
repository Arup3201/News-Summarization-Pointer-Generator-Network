The Church of England was at the centre of an extraordinary row last night over claims it is being used to stop Britain leaving the European Union.

Prayers for Britain to stay in the EU forming part of a Brussels-backed event to mark the 40th anniversary of the UK joining the Common Market are to be said in a service at Salisbury Cathedral.

The event next month is being held in Salisbury because it was the home of the late Sir Edward Heath, the Prime Minister who took the UK into what is now the EU in 1973. Leading pro-Europeans will attend.

Pray for Brussels: The 'pro-EU' service will be held at Salisbury Cathedral, Wiltshire, next month to commemorate the anniversary of the UK joining the union

The programme, obtained by The Mail on Sunday, advertises as part of the event: ‘Evensong in the cathedral, during which prayers will be said for the European Union and the UK’s place therein.’

Last night, leading Eurosceptic MP Peter Bone claimed the  C of E was being ‘hijacked’ in an outrageous attempt to influence the EU debate.

He said: ‘It is disgraceful the Europhile lobby should be trying to embroil the Church in this debate.

'I can’t remember the passage in the Bible where God or Jesus comes out in support of the EU. It cannot be right to pray for a European superstate mismanaging the lives of millions.’

Former diplomat Lord Hannay, who is hosting the event, denied there was anything ‘odd’ about such prayers. He insisted the evensong was not a special service for the EU commemoration and added: ‘I don’t think it will be “smite the Eurosceptics.” ’

But he insisted that the C of E was ‘supportive of Britain’s membership’, adding: ‘Whether or not we should be EU members is not for the Church but, once we’re members, they seem to take the view it’s a good thing.’

But embarrassingly for the organisers, Salisbury Tory MP John Glen has refused to attend.

‘I do not see the bloated bureaucracy of Europe as something to celebrate,’ he said.

A C of E spokesman said he could not comment on details of the service but insisted it was up  to the preacher to decide what he or she said.

A Salisbury Cathedral spokesman confirmed a group from the EU commemoration event were due  to attend a service of evensong.
