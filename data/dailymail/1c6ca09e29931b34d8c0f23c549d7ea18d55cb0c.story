Hundreds of flights to and from Los Angeles have been cancelled or delayed after today's shooting brought the airport to a halt. The roads leading up to the airport were also shutdown causing traffic chaos in the city.

Currently, flights to Los Angeles are being grounded at their airport. Some flights already en route to LA have been redirected to other airports  - but there are still some planes landing and taking off at the airport.

Transportation officials announced at noon to follow the official airport Twitter (@LAX_official), and check with their individual airlines for the most up to date information.

Backed up: Roads surrounding the airport have been blocked off making it impossible for arriving passengers to find ground transportation away from the airport

JetBlue is allowing their customers to rebook through other Los Angeles airports at no extra charge.

'We
are planning to divert all other flights if need be, and for anyone 
booked to LAX today, they can rebook for tomorrow or change to Burbank 
or Long Beach, without charge,' JetBlue spokesman Jenny Dervin told USA Today.  

Virgin Airlines, which has it's base in Terminal 3 where the shooting happened, announced that change and cancel fees have been waived for those traveling in or out of LAX today. Another Terminal 3 airline, Spirit, is also waiving such fees.

Some airlines have temporarily suspended their flights since their passengers can't get to the airport with the current  road closures.

The FAA announced earlier that the shooting had severely affected travel at the airport but that flights were still taking off and landing.

'The
situation at LAX is very fluid,' an FAA statement read. 'There is 
currently a ground stop for flights that are scheduled to depart for 
LAX. This means those flights are temporarily being held at their 
departure airports. Arrivals and departures are still occurring, and 
some flights may be diverted.'

At a press conference, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said that terminals 4 through 8 are still operating, but at a much slower place.

He urged people with flights today to rebook because there was still an ongoing crime scene at the aorport. According to the airport Twitter, flights will be able to take off from terminals 1 through 3 once they are 'cleared' by law enforcement. 

Gunshots were heard in the terminal 
shortly before 10am (PST) and soon after Century Boulevard and 
interstates 105 and 405 leading into the airport were closed off and 
traffic was at a standstill.

Shut down: Emergency vehicles line up outside Terminal 2 today

Stopped: A police officer stops traffic on a road outside LAX where passengers wait after being evacuated

Crime scene: In a press conference at noon, Mayor Garcetti told people not to come to the effort because of the on-going crime scene

Some confused about the status of their departing flights were seen abandoning their cars on the road and walking to LAX with their luggage even though the mayor told people not to come to the airport for 'the time being'.

The traffic is also creating problems for those arriving at the airport, making it impossible to meet their family or ground transportation.

44-year-old TV executive Brian 
Livesay had just landed on a flight from Atlanta when he noticed the 
quiet airport and heavily armed guards and learned what had happened.

He
planned to take a cab from the airport to a meeting, but ended up 
having to walk three miles to rent a car.

Trying to get home: LAX passengers wait on the curb outside the airport. Passengers who arrived at the airport shortly before the shooting are now having a hard time getting home thanks several roads being closed around LAX

Evacuating: A couple walk away from the airport with their luggage in tow. Some passengers have not been allowed to leave the airport

'If there was anything moving on four wheels besides a police car, I would be in a cab,' he told UT San Diego.

'I have a room full of CBS executives waiting for me.'

But
some people in the airport haven't been allowed to leave yet. Those who
were already past security screening in terminals 1, 2, and 3 when the 
shooting happened were taken to other terminals for sheltering.

Mythbusters
co-star Grant Imahara tweeted: 'Virgin promptly locked the lounge doors.
About ten minutes later, LAPD armed with automatic weapons arrived to 
secure the area.'
