Firefighters saved a dog using their Jaws of Life after he had wiggled between two storage containers at an elementary school. 

Spike, a 12-year-old Rhodesian ridgeback got himself stuck between the units at around noon on Sunday while playing with kids at a playground in Oceanside, California.

He apparently continued to walk deeper into the narrow gap in an attempt to get out, officials said.

Firefighters had to come to Spike's rescue with the Jaws of Life. They used the tool to shift the containers six inches

Oceanside and Carlsbad firefighters came to the rescue, however, when they arrived on scene with the Jaws of life to force the containers apart. 

The firefighters used the tool to move the storage units six inches, creating a wider gap, according to KNSD.

Once they turned off the tool and moved to the side, Spike came walking out of the space, tail slapping the edges of the containers as he was freed.   

Soon Spike, looking as happy as ever, walked back out of the narrow gap, his tail wagging back and forth and hitting the units as he was freed
