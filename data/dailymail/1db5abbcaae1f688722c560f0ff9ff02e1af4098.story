Jagger's eldest daughter Karis, 43, lives in Los Angeles with her husband and two children, and her house is reportedly being used as the home base as she and her halfsisters have gathered there to comfort their father.

Karis, who graduated from Yale in 1992, was raised early on by her mother, model Marsha Hunt who battled with Jagger until he admitted his paternity when Karis was 12-years-old.

The pair have since built their relationship, particularly given his choice to take solace in her home.

Jagger was in Perth on Monday night when news broke of his longtime partner's suicide in New York.

His daughters Georgia May and Elizabeth- sisters whose mother is Mick's second wife Jerry Hall- flew to be with him immediately and accompanied him to California.

The Rolling Stones plane refueled in Los Angeles before carrying on to England, but when it touched down in the U.K., Keith Richards was the only main band member on board.

Jagger's spokesman has since confirmed that the rocker has stayed in California and now has most of his children- Karis, Jade, Elizabeth, Georgia May, and James- by his side. (The only ones absent are his youngest sons Gabriel and Lucas, who are 16 and 14 respectively.

The latest twist in the saga surrounding Scott's sudden suicide comes as her brother has reportedly agreed to allow Jagger to plan a West Coast funeral for her.

The couple began dating in 2001 after meeting when she was a stylist on a photo shoot featuring the rock superstar.

At the time, Scott had been living in Los Angeles and she maintained a home there in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood until 2009 when she sold the three-bedroom home for $860,000.

'I can’t help thinking, now, that a huge part of L’Wren’s spirit, what gave her grit and endurance, remained in the West.

And without it, maybe she was maybe was a little lost, a little less sure of herself,' Scott's good friend Cathy Horyn, The New York Times fashion critic, wrote in a moving tribute to the designer.

She went on to recall how Scott would host dinners at the house, including a memorable outdoor Thanksgiving dinner with a number of Jagger's bandmates and their significant others in the home's walled garden.

Scott's body was found in her Manhattan apartment on Monday morning by an assistant who had reportedly been told to come over by Scott via text just moments before she killed herself.

Some close friends of the designer- including actress Ellen Barkin- went to the apartment and reportedly spent time with the body before the medical examiner removed it from the apartment.

Though spokesmen had confirmed the suicide hours after the body was found, the medical examiner ruled it as such on Wednesday.

Her body was claimed on Thursday but the medical examiner could not release the name of the individual who arranged the transfer to the Frank E. Campbell funeral home on the Upper East Side.

The funeral home, which regularly handles high-profile deaths like that of Jackie Kennedy and more recently Phillip Seymour Hoffman, is now reportedly coordinating a transfer of her body from New York to California after The New York Post revealed that her brother Randall Bambrough agreed to Jagger's wishes.
