An 85-year-old man died as he tried to flee his retirement home in France using bedsheets tied together to descend from a second floor window.

The frail pensioner plunged to his death when the sheets became untied at the old people's home in Darnetal, northern France, on Tuesday.

The man had forced open a security window in his room and lowered down knotted sheets in a bid to escape, police said.

The man had forced open a security window in his room and lowered down knotted sheets in a bid to escape the home, based at the hospital Durécu-Lavoisier, police said

But the makeshift ladder 'did not hold together' and he fell 20ft into a car park below.

Officials said an investigation had been launched to discover why the man wanted to flee the home based at the hospital Durécu-Lavoisier.

Three years ago, two fugitive nuns in their 80s went on the run in France to escape being sent to a retirement home by their Mother Superior.

Sister Marie-Daniel, 86, and Sister Saint-Denis, 82, fled their South of France nunnery after learning they were being sent to a remote mountain retreat 250 miles away.

The pair were found several days later.

Last year an 82-year-old man escaped from a hospital geriatric ward in Eastern France through an air shaft.

A search and rescue dog later picked up his scent after he had been missing for a day.
