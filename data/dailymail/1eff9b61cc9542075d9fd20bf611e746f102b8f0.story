Victim: Sandra Edwards has been left blind in one eye after being knocked from her moped by a teenager

A teenager who left a grandmother fighting for life in a coma after he smashed into her moped with his car has walked free from court with a fine of just Â£280.

Ryan Matticks, 19, was yesterday given five penalty points on his licence after admitting careless driving at South-East Suffok magistrates' court.

His victim, widow Sandra Edwards, described his sentence as 'ridiculous' as she spoke out about her horrific injuries which confined her to hospital for three months.

The 57-year-old has been left blind 
in one eye and confined to a wheelchair after the crash, in which nearly
all her teeth were knocked out and her hand was broken.

She now fears she could lose her job as a carer, as she is unable to drive to her patient's homes.

Matticks,
an apprentice engineer and father of one, knocked Mrs Edwards off her 
Piaggio moped in Ipswich on the evening of April 9 as he made a right 
turn while pulling in to his girlfriend's driveway in his Vauxhall 
Corsa.

Harriet 
Johnson, defending, said that the teenager had suffered a 'momentary 
lapse of concentration', making a mistake which 'any driver is capable 
of'.

She added that Matticks had been 'devastated' by the crash, and had had difficulty sleeping ever since.

But
Mrs Edwards said that the accident had destroyed her life, as doctors 
at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge twice told her that she was 
unlikely to survive.

She returned home to Ipswich yesterday after three months in hospital, with her treatment including a 10-hour operation.

Fury: The widowed grandmother described the driver's sentence of a fine and penalty points as 'ridiculous'

'I think it's a ridiculous 
sentence,' the victim said. 'It has ruined my life. I love my job but I 
can't work because I won't be able to drive for at least another year - 
and probably never again.

'I can't see out of my left eye - I can't open my eyelid. The hospital said it is unlikely it will fully recover.

'I
lost all my teeth except one. I broke my hand, my kneecap was smashed 
in, I can't even bend my fingers. I've lost two stone and need to eat 
liquidised foods.'

She 
added: 'Everything has changed now. He needs to learn from this - he 
needs to learn to be more responsible for his own actions.'

Mrs
Edwards was put into an induced coma for three weeks after first 
arriving at Addenbrooke's as doctors battled to save her life.

Happier times: Mrs Edwards, left, at the wedding of her daughter Nicola to Andy Tuck in 2005

'I woke up three weeks later in a hospital bed and had no idea where I was,' she said. 'I couldn't remember anything about what happened.

'I didn't know who I was - I even thought my late husband David was still alive. I was told to say goodbye to my family twice.'

She will now receive daily visits from a carer from Suffolk County Council as she seeks to recover from her injuries.

Her daughter Nicola Tuck, who lives with her, said: 'It has devastated our lives. We will not have the freedom we used to.

'Young drivers must check and check again on the roads.'
