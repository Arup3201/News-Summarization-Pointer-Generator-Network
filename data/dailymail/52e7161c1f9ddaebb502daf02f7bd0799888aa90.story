Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United are locked in a battle to sign Mile Svilar, the 15-year-old goalkeeper tipped to be the next Thibaut Courtois.

Svilar, who is currently on the books at Belgian club Anderlecht, has attracted interest from the Premier League trio following impressive performances at youth tournaments.

He has already had a trial at Chelsea and has been invited by Arsenal, while United have also enquired about the young keeper.

But his father, former Antwerp goalkeeper Ratko Svilar, says he is going nowhere for the time being.

He told Nieuwsblad: 'He has trialled at Chelsea and Manchester United also enquired. Everyone wants him.

'But we already have an agreement with Anderlecht, even though he can't sign a contract until his 16th birthday.

'There is nowhere better for him than Anderlecht. At his 20th birthday, we'll see.'

Despite being just 14 at the time, Svilar won 'best goalkeeper' awards at the Under 17 Aegon Future Cup, the Under 19 PSV Otten Cup and the Copa del Agatha this year.
