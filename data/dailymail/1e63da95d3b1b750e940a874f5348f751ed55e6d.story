Plans: Mark David Chapman said a minister in upstate New York offered him a place to live and work if he had been granted parole

The killer of famed Beatle John Lennon was denied release from prison for the seventh time, appearing once again before a parole board yesterday.

Mark David Chapman, 57, was denied parole by a three-member board after a hearing Wednesday, the state Department of Corrections said Thursday.

The transcript of his latest hearing wasn't immediately released.

Chapman shot Lennon in December 1980 outside the Manhattan apartment building where the former Beatle lived, and was sentenced in 1981 to 20 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder.

The musician, singer and songwriter was 40.

Chapman
 was transferred in May from the Attica Correctional Facility in western
 New York to the nearby Wende Correctional Facility.

Both are maximum 
security.

However, the prison system doesn't disclose why inmates are 
transferred.

Throughout the
 decades, Chapman’s wife Gloria Hiroko Chapman has paid her husband 
regular visits and will now be allowed conjugal visits in a trailer 
complete with kitchenette, living room, and two bedrooms – without 
cameras, as part of a deal Chapman made.

The 57-year-old Chapman requested that he be allowed conjugal visits with his wife in his current prison - which would take place in a trailer devoid of guards and cameras.

The request was granted earlier this week.

According to the New York Daily News, Chapman had participated in the so-called 'family reunion' program when he was an inmate at the maximum-security Attica Correctional Facility.

When he was transferred in May to Wende state prison in Genesee County - also a maximum security prison, he had to reapply for the privilege.

State prison system spokesman Peter Cutle said: 'He followed the standard procedures and protocols in our system, and his request for participation was approved.'

The program allows Chapman to be allowed to spend up to 48 hours in a trailer with his wife on prison grounds - which has a kitchenette, living room and two bedrooms.

It is free of prison guards and cameras.

His stepfather will also be able to visit.

Mr Cutler said of the program: 'We know it has beneficial impact on the inmate both for their behavior on the inside and for their eventual reentry into society.'

Gloria, a Japanese-American and former travel agent, married Chapman in Hawaii in June 1979, 18 months before he gunned down Lennon while he was signing an autograph for him.

According to the New York Daily News, who interviewed Mrs Chapman in 2008 at her single-story, bluish-gray house in the Honolulu suburb of Kailua, the couple have been enjoying these conjugal visits for the last 20 years.

She now works in a hospital in the quiet town of Kailua, 15 miles from Honolulu, and lives in the hospital-owned property across the street with two other women.

At his previous hearing, he recalled that he had considered shooting Johnny Carson or Elizabeth Taylor instead, and said again that he chose Lennon because the ex-Beatle was more accessible.

He said that his century-old Upper West Side apartment building by Central Park 'wasn't quite as cloistered.'

Chapman fired five shots outside the 
Dakota apartment house on December 8, 1980, hitting Lennon four times in
 front of his wife, Yoko Ono, and others.

The
 former security guard from Hawaii said that his motivation was instant 
notoriety but that he later realized he made a horrible decision for 
selfish reasons.

'I felt that by killing John Lennon I 
would become somebody and instead of that I became a murderer and 
murderers are not somebodies.'

'I felt that by killing John Lennon I would become somebody and instead of that I became a murderer and murderers are not somebodies,' Chapman told the board two years ago.

Ono, 79, had said two years ago that she was trying to be 'practical' in asking that her husband's killer remain behind bars.

She said Chapman might be a danger to her, other family members and perhaps even himself.

In
 a 1992 interview at Attica, Chapman told Barbara Walters that it was 
dark when he shot Lennon in the back with a .38-caliber revolver after 
he exited a limousine, headed up the walkway to his apartment building 
and looked at Chapman.

'I 
heard this voice - not an audible voice, an inaudible voice - saying 
over and over, `Do it, do it, do it,'' Chapman said. He explained, 'I 
thought that by killing him I would acquire his fame.'

He has been in protective custody with a good disciplinary record, according to corrections officials.
