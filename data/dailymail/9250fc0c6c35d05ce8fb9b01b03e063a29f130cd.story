More than 200 truckers responded to a Facebook message from a sick boy's mother who was on the hunt for a special present for her child's birthday. 

Lisa Welch's 10-year-old son Jorge, from Jimboomba in Queensland, was born with a rare condition called cortical dysplasia, causing Jorge to have the same brain functions as an 18-month-old baby. 

The disease occurs when the top layer of the brain doesn't form properly, affecting the patients ability to learn new things. 

Sick with trawling the aisles looking for baby toys, Lisa decided to take to Facebook and ask the trucking community if someone was free to bring a their rig around to Jorge's house for his big 10th birthday.

'I put an ad on Facebook and I said I'll see what happens,' she said.
