Fans of the West Coast fast food chain In-N-Out Burger who turned out for the grand opening of the 300th franchise this week got a rare chance to meet the company's reclusive billionaire owner.

Lynsi Snyder, 32, the thrice-divorced granddaughter of In-N-Out's founders, has largely kept out of the public eye since assuming control of the $1.1billion burger empire in 2010.

But Snyder made an exception Wednesday, on what would have been her grandma Esther's 95th birthday, arriving at In-N-Out's newest location on State College Boulevard to personally cut the big red ribbon.

When asked by a KTLA reporter about her notorious penchant for privacy, Snyder - America's youngest female billionaire - replied that being a mother and businesswoman, she is trying to keep her priorities straight.

Dressed in a casual yet chic ensemble consisting of a black skirt, tan sweater and knee-high boots, Snyder was all smiles as she exchanged hugs with her employees and greeted a crowd of eager patrons.

Some die-hard fans of the iconic burger chain camped out overnight to be among the first people to dine at In-N-Out's latest location.

The very first burger to come out of the kitchen at the Anaheim location went to long-time In-N-Out patron Kurt Zimmerman, who had been waiting to put in his order since 2am.

'The first burger at a new place...it's got to be the best,' the diner gushed to KCAL.

In-N-Out was started in 1948 by Lynsi Snyder's grandparents, Esther and Harry Snyder. The chain currently has locations in 13 cities in California, Arizona, Nevada, Texas and Utah.

Enigmatic: Snyder rarely appears in public and keeps her private life under wraps 

Miss Snyder inherited the billion-dollar business in 2006 after the passing of her grandmother and became the president of the company four years later.

Snyder, a deeply devout Christian, has always cut an enigmatic figure, rarely appearing in public and keeping mum about her family life.

A rare exception was her unusually candid interview with Orange Coast magazine published a year ago, in which the burger heiress opened up about being the target of two kidnapping attempts, her turbulent family history and her three failed marriages.

Snyder grew up in Northern California where her father, Guy, had a ranch. 

The Snyder family is extremely devout, so much so that Guy Snyder founded a private Christian school with the sole purpose of providing his daughter with a religious education while protecting her privacy.  

In her adult life, Snyder became involved in the Christian ministry Healing Hearts and Nations along with her second husband. 

As a teenager, she worked behind the counter at one of her family's In-N-Out locations, performing menial tasks like peeling potatoes and chopping onions. 

After the passing of her grandfather in 1976, the chain was handed down to her uncle, Rich, who was considered to be more responsible than his older brother, a drug addict.  

Tragedy struck in 1993 when Rich Snyder died in a small plane crash in Los Angeles. Lynsi was 11 years old at the time.

Her father then inherited the company, but he passed away only six years later from an accidental drug overdose.

She was only 17 when that occurred in the winter of 1999 but had expressed an interest in the family business and had spent the summer working at the Redding location.

Earlier that year, just months before her father's passing, Lynsi narrowly escaped the first of two abduction attempts.

The second failed kidnapping plot targeting the wealthy heiress came when she was 24 years old and already divorced.

Snyder's first husband was Jeremiah Seawell, her high school sweetheart, and they married when she was only 18.

The union only lasted two years, but by the time she was 25 she remarried Richard Martinez, a man who was working at In-N-Out at the time.

Matters of the heart: Lynsi met her second husband, Richard Martinez (pictured left) when they were both working at In-N-Out and they got married in 2005

They had twins before their marriage ended in 2011.Though she had the foresight to demand a prenup before marrying her second husband, she still pays him $18,000 a month in child support.

Multiple reports state that Lynsi and Richard split in 2011 and she then went on to marry drag racer Val Torres Jr later that same year.

Snyder had inherited her love of the dangerous street-racing sport from her father, along with his massive car collection.  

In July 2011, Snyder gave birth to a baby boy named Valentino Guy, but she has never mentioned this son in interviews.

In early 2014, reports emerged that the couple were in the process of getting a divorce.

Snyder currently resides with her family in a sprawling $17.4million mansion in Bradbury, California, which she bought in 2013 from former L.A. Dodgers player Adrian Beltre.
