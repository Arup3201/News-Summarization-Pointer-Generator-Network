A teenage girl was sexually assaulted by a masseur her mother had booked as a treat on her 17th birthday, a court heard yesterday.

The girl told a jury that the incident occurred after Daniel Pytlarz gave her an all-over body scrub at his upmarket salon.

She said that at first she did not know if what was happening was part of the massage, but she told him to stop when she felt him touching her intimately.

Allegations: Masseur Daniel Pytlarz, 34, is accused of molesting female patients while he worked at the Violet Body and Skincare Clinic, St. John's Wood between March 2009 and September 2011

‘I was really confused,’ she said. ‘He
asked if I liked it and I said no. He said, “Sorry, I didn’t mean to 
make you uncomfortable. I didn’t mean to push you too far”.’

The girl is one of 18 women that 
Pytlarz, 34, is accused of assaulting at the Violet Clinic Body and 
Skincare Spa which he runs with his wife in St John’s Wood, North 
London.

Lesley Jones, prosecuting, told 
Southwark Crown Court that Pytlarz took advantage of women ‘from all 
walks of life’ and of varying ages as they were in a ‘relaxed state’ and
lay naked or semi-naked on his table.

Claims: Masseur Daniel Pytlarz, 34, is accused of sexually assaulting the young girl on her birthday

She added: ‘We will hear such terms as
full body massage, tantric massage and deep relaxation massage ... the 
Crown say these terms are euphemisms used by the defendant to cover up 
his predatory behaviour.’

The court heard that the teenage girl’s session took place on September 17 last year.

The girl, who cannot be named for 
legal reasons, said she was never offered the paper underwear which 
masseurs are supposed to provide and was naked with just a towel over 
her.

She said the massage lasted 90 minutes
and it was five minutes from the end when the alleged assault took 
place.

She told police: ‘He started massaging my feet, then calves and 
then my thighs.

‘When he was on my thighs he asked if I was relaxed and then started moving a bit upwards.

‘I was thinking, was this part of the massage? I was not sure. I told him to stop. I said, “No”, and he did stop.’

The teenager, who is a virgin, told 
the court the massage then carried on ‘like regular’ and said she had 
not left for fear Pytlarz might assault her further if she tried. She 
said: ‘I felt maybe he would try to do something more or physically hurt
me.’

She said after he finished Pytlarz asked her if it was her birthday that day and said: ‘You’re 18, right?’

Claims: The jury at Southwark Crown Court heard the alleged victim begged Daniel Pytlarz to stop

When she said she had turned 17, he 
allegedly told her: ‘I hope you enjoyed your massage’, and told her 
where to go for her facial, performed by his wife.

She said that as she changed she 
noticed Pytlarz looking at her through a window in the door. Not knowing
what to do, she continued with the ‘top-to-toe treatment’ pamper 
package even though she felt ‘shaky’.

Her mother, who had dropped her off at
the spa, returned at 3.30pm to pick her up. Eleanor Laws, defending, 
suggested to the girl that the incident ‘didn’t happen at all’. The girl
replied: ‘It did.’

She later confided in a friend before telling her mother, and the police were called.

After three other women came forward, 
detectives contacted more of Pytlarz’s clients and an additional 14 
women claimed they had been assaulted by the masseur, who has been 
practising for 13 years and earned five diplomas in Poland.

Pytlarz denies 14 charges of sexual assault and seven other counts of assault against 18 women.

The trial continues.
