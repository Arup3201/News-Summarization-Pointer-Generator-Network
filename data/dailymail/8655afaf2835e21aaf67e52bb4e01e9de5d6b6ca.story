A routine traffic stop quickly escalated out of hand after a transport cop forced three members of a family to lie down in the road at gunpoint.

Neighbors in the quiet suburb of Raintree Village near Toledo, Ohio, captured the incident on cell phone and posted it on YouTube.

Local police chiefs have suspended the officer after the footage attracted a lot of attention and questions were asked about how it had gotten so out of hand.

Aaron Tatkowski, his unnamed girlfriend and his 14-year-old son lie on the ground as officer Eric Hart brandishes his weapon at them

The incident occurred on Sunday afternoon when mom-of-two Cassandra Meyers was pulled over by officer Eric Hart for a license plate violation.

When her father-in-law, Aaron Tatkowski, arrived on the scene in his truck with his girlfriend and Meyers’ two children. 

Tatkowski has said he approached Officer Hart because he didn’t like the way he was speaking to his daughter-in-law.

He is reported to have said: ‘I’m [expletive] sick of you cops. I’m [expletive] sick of you harassing people for no reason.’

A witness described Officer Hart's policing as 'totally uncalled for'

‘He hollered for me to get back in my truck, so I got back in my truck,’ Tatkowski told Toledo News Now.

‘Next thing you know, I'm yanked out of the truck and it made my girlfriend say a few things. He yanked her out of the truck.’

Tatkowski says the officer threw him, his girlfriend, his daughter-in-law, and 14-year-old son to the ground.

The police report says commands were not listened to, so Officer Hart got out his taser and handgun.

Tatkowski says he complied with Hart, but worried for his two granddaughters, who were still in his truck, so he asked witnesses to start recording what was happening.

In the video footage witnesses can be heard dialing 911, while Tatkowski and his unnamed girlfriend argue with Hart. 

Tatkowski, right, has been charged with several offenses including resisting arrest, while daughter-in-law Meyers was arrested and booked for obstructing official business

A witnesses told Toledo News Now that the police officer involved was out of line.

‘It was totally uncalled for, the way [the officer] was using force on people,’ said Jim Stechschult.

Both Officer Hart’s report and the official response from Washington Township Police state that because the ‘suspects’ in this case were disobeying direct orders, the use of force and unholstering of weapons (at one point a taser also made an appearance) was justified.

However in the wake of the video being posted online and going viral, Officer Hart - who has worked part-time for the department for about two years - has been placed on paid administrative leave.

‘He’s not in trouble, but to keep things aboveboard, we put him on administrative leave until an internal investigation is fully complete,’ Washington Township police Chief Christopher Kaiser told The Blade.

‘I’m not saying he did anything wrong, but we’re trying to show we’re not trying to sweep this under the rug or cover it up.’

Officer Hart also works for Toledo Public Schools as a school resource officer. On Tuesday, administrators put Officer Hart on paid administrative leave pending Washington’s Township inquiry, said Patty Mazur, district spokesman.

She said Officer Hart has worked for TPS about 20 months.

Tatkowski, 40, was charged with misconduct at an emergency, obstructing official business, and resisting arrest. He was arraigned Monday in Toledo Municipal Court, pleaded not guilty, and was released from the Lucas County jail on his own recognizance.

Meyers, 21, was arrested and booked into the Lucas County jail Sunday night for obstructing official business, tampering with evidence, fictitious plates, and a tax payment warrant.

The police report says that when Officer Hart's commands were not listened to he got out his taser and handgun
