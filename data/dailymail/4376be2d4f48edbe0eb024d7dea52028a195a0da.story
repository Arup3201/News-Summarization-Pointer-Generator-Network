Likewise, Galatasaray chiefs are ready to consider offloading the 30-year-old star as they look to ease their debt problems.

Newly appointed chairman Duygun Yarsuvat has been handed the task of easing the club’s precarious financial position.

Sneijder earns in the region of £2.5million-a-year at Galatasaray and the club have failed to pay him on time on more than one occasion over the past few months.

And the Turkish side have been receptive to the notion of selling him in an attempt to ease their wage bill.

It is understood Galatasaray will demand in the region of £9million for Sneijder.

And his advisers have begun the process of trying to identify a buyer for the former Inter Milan star.

United and Southampton - who both have Dutch managers - are among the sides to have been contacted about the possibility of taking Sneijder next month.

The player worked with Old Trafford boss Van Gaal during the World Cup and the pair are know to have a good relationship.

Saints manager Ronald Koeman could also be tempted into a move for his countryman as his side try to maintain their attempts to clinch a European spot next season.
