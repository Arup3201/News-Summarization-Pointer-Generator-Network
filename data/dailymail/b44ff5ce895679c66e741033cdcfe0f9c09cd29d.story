Teaching assistant Helen Louis Turnbull pictured today arriving at Teesside Crown Court on the second day of her trial

A married teaching assistant threatened to have her schoolboy lover murdered by gipsies if he tried to leave her, a court heard yesterday.

Helen Turnbull, now 35, allegedly told the 16-year-old she would hire a notorious family of travellers to shoot him.

The schoolboy said he was left in a state of constant worry, believing that Turnbull, a mother of two, had accessed confidential school records to find out his home address in order to have him killed.

The victim was allegedly groomed with sweets and cuddles from the age of 12 at his Roman Catholic secondary school in Durham.

When he turned 16 he began to meet Turnbull for liaisons in her Mini after she sent him provocative pictures of herself in her underwear, and messages asking for ‘power sex’.

Turnbull split from her husband during the brief affair, and even changed her Facebook profile picture from one featuring her three-year-old daughter to a photograph of her and the schoolboy.

On only their second meeting outside the classroom the pair are said to have kissed before having sex in Turnbull’s car. The boy said the teaching assistant gave him a packet of 10 cigarettes afterwards.

They met twice more during the summer holiday, allegedly having sex both times.

Giving evidence on a police video played to court yesterday, Turnbull’s victim, now 18, told how the affair took a sinister turn when it became ‘too much’ for him to deal with.

He told officers he had been left ‘really worried and anxious’ after Turnbull threatened to contact a family of gipsies. ‘She said: “You deserve shooting, I am going to get a contract out”,’ he added. 

‘We argued over stupid stuff and I was making excuses when she wanted to see me. It got too much, it is stupid the way it happened and what happened.’

The schoolboy said that even as he was ending their affair, Turnbull continued to send him messages and even used a teenage girl as a go-between in a bid to win him back.

He added: ‘She came by my house but I never told her my address. I don’t know how she found out where I live, that is what worried me the most... she had made threats that she is going to get people to come and see me, and she has found out where I live.’ The pupil said he assumed she had accessed his personal details on the school database.

Teesside Crown Court had earlier heard how Turnbull confronted the child’s father at the family home. He accused the teaching assistant of being a paedophile.

Turnbull denies three charges of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust, but has admitted a fourth, relating to kissing. The case continues.
