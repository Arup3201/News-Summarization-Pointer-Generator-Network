Theft: Jennifer Colenso stole from collection boxes that were dropped off at her home for cash to be counted

A volunteer treasurer who stole nearly £100,000 from an animal charity was today told her crimes were so serious that she faces jail.

While looking after the accounts for North Devon Animal Ambulance Jennifer Colenso wrote out cheques to her own accountancy consultancy firm.

The 69-year-old also stole cash from the charity’s collection boxes after they were dropped off at her home for the money to be counted.

At an earlier hearing Colenso, who has worked as an accountant for 50 years, pleaded guilty to eight charges of fraud and one of theft.

Judge Phillip Wassall was due to sentence the accountant, of West Yelland, Barnstaple, Devon, today but granted her bail to put her affairs in order.

'The seriousness of the offending here outweighs any mitigation,' Judge Wassall told the court.

'Despite the obvious and strong points of mitigation I can not avoid a custodial sentence.

'I am going to grant you bail to put your affairs in order before I impose the sentence that I must.'

White-haired Colenso, who will be 70 in a few months’ time, was surrounded by friends and family as she entered Exeter Crown Court.

The court heard she stole the money from the voluntary animal rescue service that is set up to rescue, rehabilitate and re-home domestic and wild animals.

Colenso looked after the accounts for the charity that has a number of shops and hundreds of regular financial donors.

The court heard she took the money between October 2009 and November 2010 but has since paid back the sum of over £99,000.

No other choice: Exeter Crown Court, where Colenso was told her crimes were so serious that a jail sentence would be unavoidable

The fraud came to light after other members of the charity questioned Colenso over what had happened to some legacy funds which were supposed to be put into a charity bond.

The charity then hired an accounting investigator to analyse the charity’s books and were shocked by what they found when he unearthed the thefts.

Alex Allsop, prosecuting, said: 'This is a case of a serious fraud, committed against the North Devon Animal Ambulance charity.'

He said Colenso wrote five cheques to the total value of £45,690.90 made payable to Colenso & Co. The cheques were supposed to have been made out to Market Vets.

Further cheques of £14,000 and £12,499 were used to pay Colenso’s VAT and PAYE bills to HM Revenue and Customs.

On top of this Colenso, who was also the treasurer of North Devon Yacht Club, made out a cheque to the sum of £23,634 to pay solar panel company Dulas for work due to be carried out on the roof of the club.

Finally the court heard she admitted stealing £3,652 in cash from the charity boxes the public had made donations to.

Mr Allsop told the court the money amounted to a sum of £99,476.67.

'There is no doubt there was an enormous amount of trust placed on the defendant,' the prosecutor said.

Firm: Judge Phillip Wassall said that 'strong points of mitigation' would not be enough to keep Colenso out of jail

In an impact statement from an unnamed charity trustee, the court heard they had felt 'horrendously let down by Mrs Colenso' and there had been a 'complete state of shock, disbelief and panic' when they found out about the fraud.

But in mitigation Richard Crabb told the court his client had paid back all of the money she had stolen - raised through an equity release scheme on her marital home.

He added Colenso had suffered a stroke followed by a mini stroke and was the sole carer of her husband who uses a wheelchair after he was left paraplegic following a 'freak incident'.

Mr Crabb said: 'I apologise on her behalf for the losses and upset caused by her conduct over 12 months.

'Her behaviour was inexcusable and resulted in a loss to the charity of about £100,000.

'The problem seems to have been that Mrs Colenso took on this work at a bad time in her life. She took it on without fully understanding the full extent of the work involved.

'There was a combination of health problems, that led to business problems and responsibilities at home causing increased worry and clouded judgement. She wasn’t herself and there was an element of denial.

'She was simply in a bad place and it was totally out of character. She is certainly well regarded both professionally and privately within the local community.'

Despite asking the judge to consider his client’s age, previous good character, and the fact the money had been paid back to the charity, Judge Wassall said a custodial sentence was unavoidable.

The charity is also looking for a sum of £19,000 to be paid in compensation for the investigative work done by the independent accountant.

Colenso was granted unconditional bail and told to return to court on May 3 when she will be sentenced.

Nobody from the charity was at the court hearing today.
