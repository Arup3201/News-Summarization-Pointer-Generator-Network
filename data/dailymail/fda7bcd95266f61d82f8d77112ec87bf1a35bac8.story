Sunday's World Cup final between Germany and Argentina has left many England fans struggling to know who to support - if any team at all.

The two football giants have grown to be England's greatest rivals on the international stage - inflicting a series of bitter World Cup defeats on the country's finest since 1966.

But for David Cameron the choice is easy - Deutschland uber alles. The Prime Minister will cheer on the old enemy over the  Argentines this weekend, senior Downing Street sources told MailOnline.

The Prime Minister celebrated Chelsea's 2012 Champions League triumph over Bayern Munich in  the Laurel Cabin conference room during the G8 Summit at Camp David, in Maryland in the US

Mr Cameron was rooting for Holland to beat Messi and Co. in last night's crunch semi final and had been texting the country's prime minister Mark Rutte 'furiously'.

But after the Dutch crashed out in a penalty shoot out, Mr Cameron has turned his support to the Germans.

Mr Cameron hopes his support for Germany will help smoothe his relationship with the country's Chancellor Angela Merkel and help land the UK a plumb job at the European Commission.

The Prime Minister has been struck at how closely Mrs Merkel follows German football - even at global summits with other world leaders.

A senior Downing Street source revealed how Mrs Merkel had to be asked to turn down her iPad at last month's EU summit in Ypres

The Chancellor was watching the Germany versus USA group stage match on her tablet in front of other EU leaders.

Before Chelsea's 2012 win, Mr Cameron was forced to watch as England were humiliated by Germany in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. The pair watched the game - which England lost 4-1 - at the G20 summit in Toronto, Canada

A source told MailOnline: 'She was watching it on her iPad but had not plugged in her earphones, so the sound was coming out. The Polish prime minister had to ask her to turn it down.'

Mrs Merkel had earlier travelled to Brazil to watch the Germans destroy Portugal 4-0 in the team's opening game of the World Cup.

She was pictured jumping for joy in the stands, before celebrating with the team in the dressing room afterwards.

Germany's Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski even posted a happy selfie with the Germany's leader following the drubbing of Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal.

The 59-year-old football fan threw her arms aloft in celebration as she watched the outstanding Die Mannschaft from the stands in Salvador.

Dignitaries around her - which included former France star and current Uefa chief Michael Platini - were more controlled.

Unlike Mrs Merkel, the Prime Minister is not known as a big football fan - although he supports Aston Villa because his uncle Sir William Dugdale was the club's former chairman who took him to the first ever game when he was aged 13.
