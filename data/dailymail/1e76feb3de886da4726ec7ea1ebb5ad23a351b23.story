Crystal Palace have got their mojo back.

A club that has been on an upward trajectory for the past four-and-half years was seeing all that hard work beginning to disintegrate with the acrimonious departure of Tony Pulis and the unimaginative appointment of Neil Warnock.

Palace know they will never be able to compete with the biggest sides in the land, but the Eagles thrive on being the cool kid in the Premier League playground.

Impressing neutrals with their guts, passion and eccentricities is in this club's fibre, and those attributes have all been sadly lacking since August, having been so proudly prominent last season. 

But now, with the impending appointment of Alan Pardew, Palace are back in the limelight.

Make no mistake, there's plenty for Pardew to do if Palace are to stay up, but the news of his impending appointment alone has already breathed oxygen in to an atmosphere that was becoming toxic.

Pardew is no Pep Guardiola, he's no Pulis either, but Eagles fans know he's one of them - and his managerial record isn't bad.

LMA manager of the year in 2012 with Newcastle, Palace supporters could not have hoped for any better given the situation they currently find themselves in.

Pardew's appointment will restore fans' faith in Steve Parish and the club's board, too. 

While CPFC 2010 - who saved Palace from liquidation that year - will always be universally popular among the Selhurst Park faithful, their decision-making regarding the departure of Pulis and the appointment of Warnock has come in for serious criticism in some quarters.

With the transfer window opening this week, Pardew's presence should be enough in itself to attract the players capable of keeping Palace in the top flight. At any rate, major surgery is not required. This, after all, is a squad that finished 11th last season and was significantly improved upon in the summer - hence the frustration with how things were going under Warnock.

Warnock was doing nothing for Palace's street-cred, which hit its highest point in the early 1990s when Pardew was a player.

Pardew's winner against Liverpool in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final is well documented but their performance that year was not a flash in the pan. The following season, with him in midfield, Palace finished third in the old First Division.

No one is expecting Palace to be able to do that again any time soon but with one of their own in charge - a man who just so happens to be one of the most experienced and proven Premier League managers around - pride can start coursing through those red and blue veins again.

The silence at what proved to be Warnock's final game against Southampton on Boxing Day was deafening.

However this reunion between club and cult hero goes, the decibel level will be off the scale when Tottenham visit on January 10 for Pardew's return to Selhurst Park.
