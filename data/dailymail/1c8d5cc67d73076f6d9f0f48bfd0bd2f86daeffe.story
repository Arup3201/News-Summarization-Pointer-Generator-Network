Attempting to reach an agreement on the key issue at the G20 summit - military intervention in Syria - looked futile this afternoon as leaders wrapped up with closing speeches.

Russian president Vladimir Putin said strikes against Syria would be 'counter productive' and disrupt the world economy.

While David Cameron warned the international community that it cannot 'contract out' its morality by allowing Russia to block intervention in crises such as that engulfing Syria.

Opinion is deeply divided among the G20 nations, which met at St Petersburg, Russia, on the critical issue of Syria and what role the international community should play.

President Putin, a belligerent ally of Syrian tyrant Bashar Assad, has been revelling in British MPs' rejection last week of UK participation in US-led military action.

He said in a press conference after his final speech that more countries at the summit opposed military intervention in Syria than supported it. He said only the US, France, Saudi Arabia, Canada and Turkey backed the use of force against the Assad regime.

While David Cameron has flown the flag for military intervention, Putin reminded reporters that the British parliament had rejected the idea. Of Germany, he said the Chancellor was 'cautious' and 'is not going to participate any military action'.

Putin claimed the public opinion in those countries backing strikes was against such a move.

Of those opposing military action he said: 'Who was condemning and opposing that way of action? Russia, India, China, Indonesia, Argentinian, Brazil, South Africa, Italy. And also the secretary general of the UN voiced his protest against military intervention. And let's not forget the address by the Pope, who directly voiced the inadmissibility of military intervention.'

Russian president Vladimir Putin said strikes against Syria would be 'counter productive' and disrupt the world economy. 'We stuck to our guns,' Putin said according to a live translation.

David Cameron, meanwhile, continued to advocate for military intervention and criticised the decision-making process of the UN Security Council.

The Prime Minister insisted military action had to be possible without an endorsement from the UNSC.

He said:'If we are saying there can only be a response if the UN security council votes positively, we are in fact contracting out our foreign policy, our morality to the potential of a Russian veto.

'That is a very misguided approach. That was what was frustrating in some ways about the debate last night. Some of the participants were saying this has to be decided by the UN security council, knowing that they sat on the security council and could veto any decision.'

Mr Cameron said he believed there was a case for taking action to prevent a humanitarian emergency.

He added: 'We should have learned from some of the genocides in our world that there is an imperative for a line to be drawn.'

Taking to the stage this afternoon, US president Barack Obama, told reporters he was 'listening to all ideas' on Syrian foreign policy, but said: 'So far we have not seen any ideas emerge that as a practical matter that would be capable of of doing the job.'

The president refused to be drawn on whether the US would strike Syria without approval from Congress - a position UK is now in.

Obama dodged the question, saying: 'You're not going to get a direct response.'

Earlier in the day President Obama held a surprise meeting with the Russian President.

Putin said the discussion focused on Syria during the 20 to 30 minutes and that while the two leaders disagreed he said the meeting was 'substantial and constructive'.

The meeting came Friday as Obama sought to build international backing for military action. But three days after he left Washington, it's unclear whether the global coalition the president has been seeking is any closer to becoming a reality.

Putting up stiff resistance to Obama's appeals, Russia on Friday warned the United States and its allies against striking any chemical weapon storage facilities in Syria. The Russian foreign ministry said such targeting could release toxic chemicals and give militants or terrorist access to chemical weapons.

'This is a step toward proliferation of chemical weapons not only across the Syrian territory but beyond its borders,' the Russian statement said.

Moreover, China remained a firm no. The 
European Union is skeptical about whether any military action can be 
effective. Even Pope Francis weighed in, urging leaders gathered here to
 abandon what he called a 'futile mission'.

Still, Obama was undeterred. He and French President Francois Hollande, the US's strongest ally on Syria and a vocal advocate for a military intervention, met on the sidelines of the summit about attracting European support for action.

'It's clear that there are many countries that agree with us that international norms must be upheld,' Obama said.

Holland told reporters invited into their meeting that they came to summit 'wanting as large a coalition as possible,' but without saying whether they picked up more support for military intervention.

'To do nothing would mean impunity,' Hollande said. 'We must take our responsibility' and act.

As the president pressed his case on the world stage, he was dispatching his UN ambassador, Samantha Power, to a Washington think tank to argue that the global community cannot afford the precedent of letting chemical weapons use go unpunished.

Illustrating the risks associated with a strike, however, the State Department on Friday ordered nonessential US diplomats to leave Lebanon, a step under consideration since Obama said he was contemplating military action against the Syrian regime last week.

The travel warning said it had instructed nonessential staffers to leave Beirut and urged private American citizens to depart Lebanon.

Yet even as Obama sought the global buy-in that could legitimise a potential strike, his aides were careful to temper expectations that the world community could speak with one voice.

Obama's deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, said the president wasn't asking his peers to pledge their own militaries to a US-led strike, but simply to say they agree a military response is warranted.

'We don't expect every country here to agree with that position,' Rhodes said Friday at the Group of 20 economic summit, where Obama was huddling with foreign leaders.

Standing on Russian soil, Rhodes suggested the US had given up hope that Russia - a stalwart Syria ally - could be coerced into changing its position. 'We don't expect to have Russian cooperation,' he said.
