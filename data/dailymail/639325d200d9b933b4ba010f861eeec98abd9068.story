Louis van Gaal saw his star-studded Manchester United team celebrate the dawn of a new era at Old Trafford and then declared: ‘We can do much better.’

Record £60million signing Angel di Maria scored on his home debut and had a hand in United’s other three goals in a 4-0 win over QPR, but even he was criticised for giving away the ball too often.

‘When you assist three goals and score the first, then you cannot play badly, but he had a lot of losses so can do better,’ said Van Gaal.

‘I am analysing the game and I see things we can improve as a team.

‘When you have a 4-0 result then you can be happy as a coach but you always have points you can improve. The result is fantastic but we can do much better. This is a good start.’

Van Gaal dedicated his first Premier League win to his wife Truus. It lifted United up to ninth in the table and Van Gaal promised plenty more attacking football at Old Trafford.

‘This is special because it is also my wife’s birthday,’ said Van Gaal. ‘She said the biggest present shall be victory. We gave it to her.

‘I have worked (in football) for more than 35 years and I have always [attacked]. I hope at the end of this league we shall score the most.’

He added: ‘I hope to be manager of the champions – if not this year then in my second or third year.’

Di Maria insisted he had meant to score his free-kick. ‘I’ve been practising during the week and done that in training so it wasn’ t a surprise,’ he said. ‘I’m very happy with my Old Trafford debut. I feel very much at home.’

QPR boss Harry Redknapp questioned the quality of United’s defence and whether it will be good enough to repel the likes of Chelsea. ‘They have plenty up front,’ said Redknapp. 

‘Whether they can cope with the forwards Chelsea have, that will be another game.’
