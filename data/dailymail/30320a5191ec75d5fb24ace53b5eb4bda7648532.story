Trevor Shonk, who represents Ukip on Kent County Council and Ramsgate Town Council, blamed Labour and the Conservatives for allowing in more immigrants than the country could cope with

The Ukip leadership has moved to distance the party from remarks made by one of its councillors who claimed an 'overload' of immigrants had turned Britain into a racist country.

Trevor Shonk, who represents Ukip on Kent County Council and Ramsgate Town Council, blamed Labour and the Conservatives for allowing in more immigrants than the country could cope with.

But Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans later rejected the suggestion, saying that Mr Shonk didn't express himself 'as well as he could'. 

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Mr Shonk said: 'The two main parties that have been running this country have made the country racist because of the influx that we have had.

'When I've done leaflets every shopkeeper, whether they are Asian or English born, they're concerned about the influx.

'It hasn't been staggered, it's just overload. We haven't got the care homes, we haven't got the houses for our own.'

However Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans rejected the suggestion that Britain was racist and said that Mr Shonk 'didn't express it as well as he could'.

'I think Britain is actually a very accommodating country and I don't think by any stretch of the imagination can be termed racist,' she told The World at One.

'I know what councillor Shonk meant. Perhaps he didn't express it as well as he could. There has of course been a massive increase in immigration which people find incredibly difficult to deal with.'

The incident comes after Ukip parliamentary candidate Kerry Smith was forced to stand down over racist and homophobic comments he made.

And earlier this week, Ukip expelled a prominent local councillor who is understood to have links with a far-Right group.

Rozanne Duncan was dropped with immediate effect for associating with an organisation which ‘clearly brings the party into disrepute’ while serving on Thanet District Council in Kent.

Her allegiance with the group came to light after comments she made in an unbroadcast television interview, which have been described as ‘jaw-dropping’.

Ukip was also forced to row back after Mark Reckless, the party’s MP in Rochester and Strood, suggested that Ukip would like migrants who have been settled in the UK for years to be repatriated. 

Meanwhile another Ukip councillor in Kent, Martyn Heale, was reported to have spoken of his 'regret' at having been a member of the far right National Front in the 1970s.
