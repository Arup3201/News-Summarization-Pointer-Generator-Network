An unemployed father has been left devastated after a haul of gold which he inherited from his mother was stolen from his council flat.

Paul Dale kept £30,000 worth of gold bars and coins in a kitchen cabinet at his home in Pyle, South Wales.

But one day he returned to the ground-floor flat to find the family heirlooms gone, along with the Christmas present he had bought for his seriously ill son.

Theft: Paul Dale, a father of six, has had £30,000 worth of gold stolen from his home in Wales

Mr Dale, 45, was not insured and so is unable to claim any compensation for the loss.

The father of six inherited 12 1oz bars of gold and three coins from his mother when she died of cancer two years ago.

He kept them in a red velvet bag next to his plates and dishes - but when he drove his girlfriend home to Devon on Sunday, he left a window open allowing burglars to enter the flat.

Mr Dale, a former soldier who can only do menial work after suffering two strokes, believes the thief must have known where to find the gold.

'You would not have seen it unless you knew it was there,' he said. 'They were in a deep dish.'

When he noticed that the bag was missing, he hoped his eight-year-old son Tyler had moved it - but when the boy said he had not touched it, he began to worry.

'My heart hit the floor,' Mr Dale said. 'I started to panic and look around my home.

He added: 'I turned the house upside down looking for it. Where could I keep it but at home?

'It's heartbreaking - it's the only thing I had from my mother.'

The burglars also took a Kindle e-reader which Mr Dale was planning to give his son Marshall for Christmas.

The five-year-old has a degenerative genetic disease called Sanfilippo Syndrome, whose sufferers typically live only into their teens.

Detective Sergeant Paul Mason, of South Wales Police, urged pawn shops to be 'vigilant' in looking for the stolen items, saying that the velvet bag they were in had probably been discarded.

'The property stolen is very distinctive,' he said. 'We believe the person who stole the items will try to sell it on to a collector or will try to weigh the gold in for cash.'

Anyone with information about the crime is urged to contact South Wales Police.
