Beginning this summer, Frozen film enthusiasts will have the opportunity to embark on an entire cruise inspired by the animated blockbuster.

Disney Cruise Lines have just announced that they will offer an immersive experience - including a deck party, three-song stage show and character meet and greets - on board select Disney Magic and Disney Wonder sailings.

And no, these ships aren't just headed to the Caribbean - appropriately, the Frozen-themed journeys will take place on cruises to Europe and Alaska.

Anna, Elsa and Olaf will be on board the Disney ships for the special Frozen-themed cruises

The selected ships will be transformed into a winter wonderland on par with the Kingdom of Arendelle.

On one special morning, guests will wake up to discover that a magical freeze has overtaken the atrium lobby, with sparkling icicles adorning the grand staircase.

Throughout the day, the chill will move to the upper decks of the ship, with giant snowflakes and snow-covered rocks. 

The family-friendly cruises will tour Alaska and Europe, whisking passengers to destinations not unlike Arendelle 

That evening, families will be able to attend an interactive deck party, called 'Freezing the Night Away with Anna, Elsa and Friends,' featuring the famous royal sisters.

A high-energy line dance, set to the movie's ice cutting scene, will also mean the arrival of Kristoff and Princess Anna.

Sven, the trolls and Olaf will also make special, virtual appearances at the party.

But, of course, a party isn't a party until Elsa arrives to serenade the guests with a performance of her hit song, 'Let It Snow.'

And after the family fun wraps up, adults can head to the nightclub for specialty frozen drinks.

Character meet-and-greets, special shows and a Frozen deck party will also happen on board

Aboard the Disney Magic ship, there will also be an at-sea stage show debuting, where Frozen favourites will perform renditions of three popular songs.

For those heading to Norway aboard the Disney Magic, there will be the opportunity for guests to join exciting new Port Adventures that bring the fairytale setting to life.

As Norway did serve as the inspiration for Frozen's Kingdom of Arendelle, an exclusive ashore adventure to the storybook village of Ålesund will help bring the story to life.

Other shore excursions on this particular route will send guests off to discover natural wonders, stunning architecture and Scandinavian culture, on either seven or nine-night voyages.
