Tottenham have announced the signing of Benjamin Stambouli from Montpellier on a £4.7million move after the defensive midfielder passed a medical. 

The player was present at White Hart Lane on Sunday to watch Tottenham lose to Liverpool and has signed a four-year deal.

Fiorentina had been close to their own £4.7m move for Stambouli, 24, while Swansea had also made a bid. However, Tottenham moved quickly to hijack the deal.
