She already boasts an e-boutique and sells her coveted designs in luxury stores all over the world, but Victoria Beckham is clearly set on fashion world domination.

The designer, who describes her eponymous range as her true passion, is opening a standalone store in London which will be the first boutique exclusively dedicated to her brand.

Located on Dover Street in swanky Mayfair, the refurbished shop is starting to take shape as the luxurious store of Mrs Beckham's dreams.

Victoria Beckham's first-ever London store is under construction and set to open in September

The shop, which is located at number 36 on the stylish street, is set to open in September to coincide with fashion month.

Today, builders could be seen working on the new shop, which Victoria paid a visit to herself last week.

The designer, who is well known for her hands-on approach to business, kept her outfit simple yet stylish as she walked out of the property with a grey blazer draped casually around her shoulders on Friday.

The 40-year-old clutched a black folder and leather day bag from her own collection as she made her way to her chauffeur-driven car.

Until today black boards featuring the former Spice Girl's website address covered the shop front, hiding any work going on inside.

Victoria tweeted a far from glamorous photo of a toilet during her outing, captioning it: 'Late night store visit #Victoriabeckhamdoverstreet x super chic! X vb.'

Along with her main collection, the new boutique will also house the sister range Victoria Victoria Beckham, as well as accessories and denim.

Speaking to Women's Wear Daily, Beckham revealed that customers visiting the store would get an insight into the brand and the design process.

Now we can all look like her! Along with her main collection, the new boutique will also house sister range Victoria Victoria Beckham, as well as accessories and denim

'I think the time is now because I know my customer,' she explained. 'It will be the first time that the people will really be able to see the brand through my eyes.' 

The interior of the 7,000 square foot space will be given a new look by architect Farshid Moussavi, whose credits include the Museum of Contemporary Art in Cleveland.

Plans include drilling a hole through the middle of the building to link the boutique's three floors and creating a conceptual interior.

'[Moussavi] is a woman who loves fashion as well,' she added. 'She has quite a conceptual eye, which I like.

'We want to make something different without making it overly complicated. I just want it to feel real for me.'

The busy mother-of-four today launched her reverse auction on the Outnet.com, which will see some of her most iconic clothes auctioned off with the price dropping every five minutes.

Meanwhile, her husband David was spotted frolicking on the beach in Malibu with his children and family friends Gordon and Tana Ramsay.

Fashion-mad David has designed a range of Bodywear for H&M, which lands in store tomorrow.
