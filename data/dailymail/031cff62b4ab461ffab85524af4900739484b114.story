The filming of a race scene in the latest Fast and Furious film was cancelled by studio bosses because it was too dangerous, it has been reported.

The scene was reportedly due to feature a modified yellow Chevelle performing a wheelie while racing another car with cheering bystanders by the side of a track.

Sources have told TMZ that studio bosses on Thursday cancelled the shot just before filming began over fears of another crash following the tragic accident of the film franchise's star Paul Walker last year.

A race scene in the latest Fast and Furious film, similar to a sequence in the first film (pictured), has been cancelled by the studio, it has been reported

Paul Walker, who shot to fame in the Fast And Furious franchise alongside Vin Diesel, died at the age of 40 in a high-speed car crash in Santa Clarita, California, in November

Insiders at the Willow Springs 
International Raceway near Palmdale, California, also told TMZ that a member 
of the production team had said there were problems with insurance for 
the scene, which had been planned for the latest film in the franchise, 
Fast and Furious 7.

Mr Walker died at the age of 40 after 
the Porsche Carrera GT he was riding in as a passenger crashed and burst
 into flames, killing him and his friend Roger Rodas, who was driving.

The accident took place following an event in Santa Clarita, California, for Mr Walker's charity Reach Out Worldwide in November last year.

On Thursday his long-time co-star Michelle Rodriguez made a point to show he'll never be forgotten. She posted a photo on Instagram alongside Vin Diesel to pay tribute to their late co-star.

Ms Rodriguez shared the snap with her 670,000
 followers with the heartfelt caption: 'Ride or Die through thick and 
thin 15 yrs later surreal to think we made it through such a tough 
painful production. But this ones for you P I hope we make you proud 
love you.'

It was an eventful day for the cast of the film as it was the final day of production for Fast and Furious 7.

Paul's brother Cody, 25, agreed to film crucial scenes for the film following the star's death in November as a tribute to his older brother.
