Jews have reportedly been told to register with pro-Russian forces in the east Ukrainian city of Donetsk or face deportation.

A pamphlet handed out in Donetsk orders 'citizens of Jewish nationality' over the age of 16 to pay $50 to register and be issued special passports 'marking the confession of faith'.

The leaflets, a chilling echo of Nazi persecution, were handed out to Jews leaving a local synagogue by three men in ski masks holding the flag of the Russian Federation, Israeli media reports.

Sinister: A leaflet distributed in Donetsk, Ukraine calling for all Jews over 16 years old to 'register'. The leaflet also demanded the city's Jews supply a detailed list of all the property they own, or else have their citizenship revoked

Jews living in the area of the self-declared 'Donetsk People's Republic' were ordered to register at a government building operated by pro-Russian forces or face the threat of deportation.

Today, the Donetsk People's Republic said they will only leave the occupied government buildings in the area if the interim government in Kiev resigns.

Leader Denis Pushilin, who earlier today spoke to MailOnline denying any involvement in the anti-Semitic handout, said his organisation do not recognize the Ukrainian government as legitimate.

Pushilin said the deal signed yesterday specifies that all illegally seized buildings should be vacated, but in his opinion it is the government in Kiev is occupying public buildings illegally.

The deal, backed by Ukraine, Russia and several western states, calls for the immediate return of all government buildings seized by pro-Russian militia, but none of the government buildings seized across eastern Ukraine has yet been vacated, according to local media on Friday.

It was brokered in Geneva yesterday where U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry seized the opportunity to condemn the leaflets, which recall the days of czarist pogroms and Nazi-era persecution of Jews, calling them ‘grotesque’.

Bad deal: A former aide to Vladimir Putin claims Ukrainians were 'sold out' and 'betrayed' in Thursday's agreement in Geneva

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry  and Russian Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday after signing the deal regarding the tensions between Russia and Ukraine in Geneva yesterday

Speaking in Geneva after top diplomats
 from the U.S., European Union, Russia and Ukraine reached agreement on 
steps to de-escalate the situation, Secretary of State John Kerry 
denounced the leaflets.

‘In
 the year 2014, after all of the miles traveled and all of the journey 
of history, this is not just intolerable; it's grotesque,’ Kerry told 
reporters.

‘It is 
beyond unacceptable. And any of the people who engage in these kinds of 
activities, from whatever party or whatever ideology or whatever place 
they crawl out of, there is no place for that. ‘

Kerry
 also denounced apparent threats to members of the Russian Orthodox 
Church from members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.

He noted that the 
agreement signed on Thursday ‘strongly condemned and rejected all 
expressions of extremism, racism and religious intolerance, including 
anti-Semitism.’

It requires
 all sides to refrain from 
violence, intimidation or provocative actions, however,it does not 
require Russia to withdraw some 40,000 troops massed near the border.

As
 the news of the anti-Semitic leaflet broke, Russian Foreign Minister 
Sergey Lavrov promised amnesty to pro-Russian protesters who 
participated in an uprising against the government in Kiev, except those
 found guilty of capital crimes.

 'Independent Donetsk Republic, General Staff

'Dear citizens of Jewish nationality:

'Taking 
into consideration the fact that the leaders of Jewish community of 
Ukraine has supported banderovtsy’s Junta in Kiev, and have been hostile
 to Orthodox Donetsk Republic and its citizens, the General Staff of 
Donetsk People’s Republic has decreed the following:

'All
 citizens of Jewish nationality who are older than 16 years-old that 
have been living within the territory of Sovereign Donetsk Republic 
should attend acting Commissioner for nationalities affairs in Donetsk 
Regional Government Department, office 514 for registration before 03 
May 2014. The registration fees are 50 USD.

'You
 should bring the amount of 50 USD for registration fees, passports for 
marking the confession of faith, documents showing family members, 
entitling documents for title to real property and transport facilities.

'In
 case of attempts to avoid the registration, the subject persons’ 
citizenship will be revoked with their subsequent enforced deportation 
outside Donetsk Republic including the forfeiture of their property. '               

Your People’s Governor – Denis Pushilin

The U.S. State Department said it was looking into who is responsible, but said it took the threat seriously no matter who was behind the leaflets.

Although the leaflets were signed by Donetsk People's Republic, its leader denied any involvement in the matter and says the leaflets are fake.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Denis Pushilin said today in Donetsk, where he has declared independence from Ukraine: ‘I strongly deny that this document on registering Jewish people is genuine.

‘I have never written and signed anything like this, nor orders on food coupons, nor taxes for businessmen nor registration for foreign students, all of which have been reported.

‘Those documents are aimed to discredit our people's republic. They are fakes.’

Of the order about Jew's being forced to register, or lose their rights to property, he insisted: ‘Look at this document. I have never called myself the people's governor, my job is different.

‘The stamp is bigger than it should be because it was Photoshopped from some real document.

‘I am personally strongly against any declarations of this sort made against Jewish or any other people. This is a dirty trick by our foes.’

According to USA Today,
 the leaflet says all people of Jewish descent over 16 should report to 
the Commissioner for Nationalities in the Donetsk Regional 
Administration building and 'register.'

It
 goes on to explain that the reason for this is that leaders of the 
Jewish community of Ukraine supported Bendery Junta in reference to the 
leader of a nationalist group fighting for independence at the end of 
the Second World War.

The letter features the flag of the so-called Donetsk Republic, a self-proclaimed state declared earlier this month by several hundred activists who occupied the Regional Administration Building and the City Hall buildings in the city.

Russia has a long and unfortunate history of the persecution of the Jewish people.

In the late 18th century, Catherine the Great created the Pale of Settlement, which dictated where in Imperial Russia Jews were allowed to reside, an area of about 20 per cent of then-European Russia which today is part of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Moldova and, notably, Ukraine.

Tsarist Russia also saw a wave of anti-Jewish  riots, known as pogroms, which took off with the violent persecution in Odessa in 1821, now the third largest city in Ukraine, which had one of the highest percentages of Jewish population in the Pale of Settlement.

Decades of pogroms followed, with a peak between 1881 to 1884 when more than 200 anti-Jewish events occurred in the Russian Empire, notably in Kiev, Warsaw and Odessa.

The trigger was the assassination of Russia's Tsar Alexandr II, for which many blamed 'The Jews'.

Between 1903 and 1906 thousands of Jews were killed in pogroms, including the 1905 pogrom of Odessa which saw up to 2,500 Jewish men, women and children killed, according to historic reports.

The pogroms,  harsh conditions and wide-spread poverty in the Pale of Settlement saw some two million Jews emigrate, mainly to the U.S. in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

During the Soviet era, the Soviet Union and countries within its sphere of influence were accused of persecuting Jews.

Josef Stalin was said by numerous sources to despise Jews and under Brezhnev, Jews faced discrimination.

Late last 
night, President Barack Obama said he was sceptical about Russian promises
 to de-escalate a volatile situation in Ukraine, and said the United 
States and its allies are ready to impose fresh sanctions if Moscow 
doesn't make good on its commitments.

'My
 hope is that we actually do see follow-through over the next several 
days, but I don't think, given past performance, that we can count on 
that,' President Obama said at an impromptu news conference at the White House a few hours after the end of the meeting in Geneva.

'We have to be prepared to potentially respond to what continue to be efforts of interference by the Russians in eastern and southern Ukraine.

'The question now becomes, will in fact they use the influence that they've exerted in a disruptive way to restore some order so that Ukrainians can carry out an election, move forward with the decentralization reforms that they've proposed, stabilize their economy and start getting back on the path of growth and democracy and that their sovereignty will be respected?'

In March, leaders of Ukraine’s Jewish 
communities published an open letter denouncing Russian anit-semitism 
and criticising Putin.

The Kiev-based Vaad of Ukraine is an umbrella group that says it supports '265 Jewish organizations from 94 cities of Ukraine'.

The
 letter, written in Russian and co-signed by 21 Jewish leaders — 
including the Vaad leadership, supports Ukrainian sovereignty 'in the 
name of national minorities and Ukraine’s Jewish community.'

Putin has justified his military 
action by claiming that he is acting to protect Ukraine’s 
Russian-speaking population and claims that Ukraine’s new government is 
composed of 'fascists and neo-Nazis'.

But the 
letter, claiming to represent Russian-speaking Jews, said: 'Your 
certainty about the growth of anti-Semitism in Ukraine, which you 
expressed at your press conference, also does not correspond to the 
actual facts,'

'Perhaps
 you got Ukraine confused with Russia, where Jewish organizations have 
noticed growth in anti-Semitic tendencies last year.'
