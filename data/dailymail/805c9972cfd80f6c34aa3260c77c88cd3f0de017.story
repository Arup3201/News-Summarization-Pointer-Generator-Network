Tragedy: Sophie Leigh Balmer died after taking 'rock star' ecstasy, police have said

A 'bright' student has died after taking a 'rock star' version of ecstasy, police said today.

The death of Sophie Leigh Balmer, 18, from Liverpool, has led to the arrest of an 18-year-old man for allegedly dealing the party drug.

The teenager was taken to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital on 
Sunday afternoon after becoming unwell. 

She died later and a post mortem examination will be carried out to establish the cause 
of death, Merseyside Police said.

'Detectives believe that the 
deceased may have taken a green coloured "rock star" ecstasy tablet 
shortly before she died and as a precautionary measure they are warning 
people not to take this type of tablet,' a police spokesman said.

An 18-year-old man from the Litherland area of Merseyside has been arrested 
on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs.

He has been taken to a police station on Merseyside where he will be questioned.

Tributes to the teenager were paid on Facebook and Twitter by devastated friends and family.

Her
cousin William Burgess wrote on Twitter: 'You have left the biggest 
hole in our family, such a big personality. Can't believe ur gone.

'Sophie Balmer best cousin in the world.'

Investigation: The 18-year-old's death led to the arrest of another teenager on suspicion of supplying the drug

He added: 'Whenever I look up to the night sky and see the brightest star I will always think of you cuz.'

Friend
Nicola McKeever wrote on Facebook: 'Soph was always the one to mellow 
everybody out and had the biggest heart ever, just so chilled with 
everything and didn't have a care in the world.'

Lily Francesca 
Harrison wrote: 'I wake up and find out the tragic news about Sophie 
Balmer. I can't believe it. Sophie, you were a beautiful, talented and 
wonderful young girl.

'Your smile could light up the world, and now 
you'll be doing the same when you're looking down on us as the brightest
star in the sky. R.I.P. Sophie, I'm going to miss you.'

Emotional: The teenager's death has led to a large number of tributes from her friends and family

Substance: Police believe Sophie took a rock star version of ecstasy like this one, which comes in bright colours like pink and green

The drug, 
dubbed 'rock star' sparked a series of police warnings in Lanarkshire, 
Scotland, in March after seven people were hospitalised and one died 
after allegedly taking the tablets which were being sold as ecstasy.

The Scottish pills were described as yellow or red and were also said to have carried a star logo.

Officers
from Strathclyde Police said at the time that while the exact contents 
were unknown, they could contain a cocktail of different substances.

Inquiries
in Liverpool are under way to find out where the tablets were bought 
and officers are appealing to anyone who may have information to contact
St Anne Street Police station on 0151 777 6064, or Crimestoppers on 
0800 555 111.
