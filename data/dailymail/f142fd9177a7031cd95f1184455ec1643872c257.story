He may be a 76-year-old retired general, but don’t try telling Colin Powell that he isn’t up on all the latest trends.

In a Facebook posted entitled Throwback Thursday, the former secretary of state has posted a self-portrait that he took as a much younger man back in the 1950s.

The 60-year-old vintage selfie shows a teenage Powell standing in front of a mirror and holding an old-style shutter camera up to capture his own reflection.

Retired general Colin Powell, 76, has posted this 60-year-old self-portrait on Facebook as a Throwback Thursday snap

The photo shows the former four-star general as a rather dapper young man dressed in a smart shirt and tie with the bottom button on his waistcoat undone. It was most likely taken in the parent’s apartment in the South Bronx, New York.

Nowadays someone would use a special retro filter to achieve the sepia-tinted look that Powell’s black and white photo has achieved all on its own.

Powell also made reference to Ellen De Generes in his post.

‘Throwback Thursday – I was doing selfies 60 years before you Facebook folks. Eat your heart out Ellen!’ he wrote.

At last month’s Oscars ceremony, DeGeneres famously took one of the famous selfies ever which featured a host of Hollywood A-listers including Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Meryl Streep.

Ellen's tweeted photo quickly amassed more than 3.3 million retweets and set a new record.

It is good to see that Powell hasn’t given up on social media after having his Facebook hacked almost exactly a year ago.

Last March a hacker, using the handle Guccifer, began uploading messages disparaging former President George W Bush. One post read: 'You will burn in hell, Bush!'

In one bizarre post, the hacker ranted: 'Kill the illuminati! Tomorrow’s world will be a world free of illuminati or will be no more!'

General Powell later took to Facebook and posted an apology to more than 82,000 people who 'like' his page, acknowledging that his page had been hacked.

He posted: Dear Friends, as most of you realize, my fb page has obviously been hacked. I'm sorry you have to see all the stupid, obscene posts that are popping up.

Guccifer also hacked an AOL email account being to Powell and made public details about a relationship with a Romanian diplomat.

Powell acknowledged a 'very personal' email relationship but denied further involvement.
