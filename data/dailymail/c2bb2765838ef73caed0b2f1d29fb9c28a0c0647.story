Accompanied by no fewer than three bodyguards, the Duchess of Cambridge was yesterday spotted dashing into Gap to pick up some last-minute baby clothes for her family’s upcoming tour to New Zealand and Australia.

And Kate made sure she travelled in style for her shopping trip, arriving in a Range Rover which had brought her all of 500 yards from her home in Kensington Palace.

After her minute-long drive she took 20 minutes to browse the shelves of Baby Gap for her eight-month-old son.

The Duchess of Cambridge was yesterday spotted dashing into Gap to pick up some last-minute baby clothes for her family's upcoming tour to New Zealand and Australia

The Duchess of Cambridge spent a total of £126.44 and  queued behind other shoppers to pay for her purchases with a credit card.

Among the items she picked up for George was a green checked bodysuit designed to look like a shirt costing £12.95. 

She also bought some denim shorts for £14.95, two navy and white striped babygrows for £14.95 each and a pair of grey and navy striped cotton trousers for £8.95.

On the way out Kate – who was dressed in knee-high leather boots, black tights and a short patterned skirt – couldn’t resist picking up two pairs of trousers for herself from the store’s women’s department.

Members of staff said the Duchess had become a ‘regular shopper at the store’ since becoming a mother.

But Kate soon decided to leave through a side entrance and meet her driver, who had been waiting outside for her on a double yellow line with the engine running.

The Cambridges are due to leave the UK on Saturday for the long flight to New Zealand where they will embark on a much anticipated ten-day visit on behalf of the Queen.

Their programme includes George’s first official public engagement as a member of the Royal Family.

The family, accompanied by George’s new Spanish-born nanny Maria Theresa Turrion Borrallo, will then fly onto Australia for a similar period where a warm welcome is also anticipated.

Although the trip is, ostensibly, William and Kate’s tour, all eyes will be on the little future king who is teething and has just learned to crawl.

An official portrait, released by the couple at the weekend to mark the trip, showed George has inherited his father’s blonde locks and his mother’s dark ‘Middleton eyes’.

The little prince was wearing a baby blue cashmere jumper with his name embroidered on it, a present from his doting grandfather.

The knitwear was created by Royal Warrant holders Corgi Hosiery.

The Carmarthenshire-based company gave it as a gift to Prince Charles to celebrate the birth of his first grandson, who then passed it onto his son and wife.

A spokesman for the company said they regularly supply the prince and his family with ‘fine quality’ knitwear and had been producing bespoke hand-finished cashmere personalised baby jumpers for the past few years.

Chris Jones, who now runs his great grandfather’s company with his sister Lisa Wood, says he was delighted when they saw the photo.

‘We were so happy to see such a beautiful picture of the prince with his parents and we were thrilled when we noticed that he was wearing our gift,’ he said.

‘The staff who designed and produced the jumper are very excited, as are we, to know that his parents chose to dress him a Corgi jumper for such an important occasion.

'It was a lovely natural family photo.’
