This is the first glimpse of Cressida Bonas making her Hollywood debut in new movie Tulip Fever. 

Prince Harry’s former girlfriend, 25, has been named one to watch by movie bigwig Harvey Weinstein.

And he has already given her a part in the film set in 17th century Amsterdam, where an artist falls for a married young woman when he's commissioned to paint her portrait by her husband. The pair then invest in the risky tulip market in the hope of building a future together.

Cressida plays the role of Mrs Steen, a merchant's young wife, while model of the moment Cara Delevingne will play artists’ model Annetje.

Debut: The first picture of Cressida Bonas in the movie Tulip Fever, produced by the Weinstein Company. She plays a young wife in 17th century Amsterdam 

Dane DeHaan plays the artist who falls for the young wife, played by Alicia Vikander, while the Oscar winner Christoph Waltz plays her husband. 

The screenplay, by Sir Tom Stoppard, is adapted from a novel by Deborah Moggach and was originally set to star Jude Law and Keira Knightley in 2004.

However, the production was halted as a result of changes in tax rules affecting film production in the UK. Last year, producer Alison Owen teamed up with Harvey Weinstein to restart the film, which will be released later this year. 

Dame Judi Dench also joins the cast as does Glee star Matthew Morrison and Tom Hollander.  

Mr Weinstein said: ‘Cressida is great and people will see what a fantastic actress she is. It will be the first of many roles for her.’

He praised her for not trying to use her fame to secure roles, saying: ‘She is not taking advantage of any media profile.’

Who says you can only wear white in the summer? Cressida Bonas dazzled in an alabaster Mulberry  dress at the Bafta Tea Party in LA and solidified her status as one of fashion's "It" girls.

Prince Harry's ex was recently announced as the new face of the luxury brand so it was fitting that she represented in a piece from their Spring Summer 15 collection. The sleeveless maxi was adorned with cutouts along the front panel for a playful peek-a-boo effect.

Apparently the budding actress liked this look so much she decided to wear it twice when she showed up to a Golden Globes afterparty in a black version. While this dress is not available online, we found a several similar options to copy this look.

And Cressida was the bell of the ball in Hollywood last weekend as she dazzled in white at a BAFTA tea party to celebrate the Golden Globes in Los Angeles last weekend, joining Cara Delevingne, Keira Knightley and the ladies of hit TV show Downton Abbey as they partied in the sunshine.

She was then seen at celebrity hot-spot Chateau Marmont on Saturday, posing arm in arm at a pre-Golden Globes dinner, with Downton Abbey stars Joanne Froggatt and Laura Carmichael - and then at the Weinstein Company's Golden Globes bash on Sunday night.

Cressida who wore two identical £1,800 Mulberry dresses in black and white for the occasion, has performed in a short film for the British designer She appears opposite Freddie Fox, with whom she's been pictured recently. 

Filming: Tulip Fever was shot in Norfolk, Suffolk and at Pinewood Studios in the UK 

Actor Freddie, 26, the son of Day Of The Jackal star Edward Fox and actress Joanna David. has established himself in films such as The Riot Club and his role with Cressie led to speculation, since denied, that the pair are romantically involved.

The Daily Mail's Sesbastian Shakespeare reported that Mulberry did not cast the daughter of Sixties model Lady Mary Gaye Curzon because of her relationship with Prince Harry but because executives were so impressed by the final video she made as a dance student at Leeds University.

She graduated five years ago. A spokesman says its talent-spotters were 'charmed by her movement which inspired the concept' of the 30-second commercial.
