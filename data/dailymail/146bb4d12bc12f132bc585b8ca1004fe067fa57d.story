Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has announced that a British Bill of Rights should include special legal protection for journalists

A new Bill of Rights should include special legal protections for Britain’s journalists and its 300-year-old free Press, the Culture Secretary will say today.

Sajid Javid will commit the Tories to changes that will strengthen the law around Press freedoms if the party wins next year’s general election.

In a speech to the Society of Editors, the minister will announce that a Conservative government will replace Labour’s Human Rights Act with a new British Bill of Rights and Responsibilities.

‘Passed in our Parliament and rooted in our values, it will restore British judges as the ultimate arbiters of British justice,’ he will say.

‘I’m delighted to announce that I have agreed with the Justice Secretary that the British Bill of Rights will include specific protection for journalists and a free Press.

‘The Human Rights Act and the European Court of Human Rights have not done enough to protect journalists who play such a unique role in our society. Our British Bill of Rights will change that.’

The minister will consult on the specific measures to be included, but they are expected to include a new legal right for journalists to protect their sources as well as a broad new public interest defence.

At the moment, the rights of the Press are enshrined in a series of different Acts including the Human Rights Act, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, the Data Protection Act, the Defamation Act and the Contempt of Court Act.

Aides said a new Bill of Rights would offer an opportunity to ‘abandon this piecemeal approach and ensure Press freedom is enshrined in legislation clearly, unequivocally and in one place’. 

Following the Leveson Inquiry and the row over Press regulation, Mr Javid has attempted to reassure critics of government handling of the issue.

He said soon after his appointment this year: ‘The Press is hugely important and freedom of speech is a cornerstone of our democracy. I’m proud of the Press.

‘Notwithstanding the fact that any industry has its bad apples, I think our Press is the best in the world. It is fearless without favour.’

Home Secretary Theresa May has vowed to tighten the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act which has been used by police to access journalists’ phone records without a judge’s approval

The Conservatives plan to publish a draft Bill around the end of the year. 

Home Secretary Theresa May has vowed to tighten the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act which has been used by police to access journalists’ phone records without a judge’s approval.

It has emerged in recent weeks that police have been using the legislation to force telecoms companies to hand over information without customers’ knowledge.

Detectives investigating disgraced MP Chris Huhne’s speeding fraud secretly obtained a Mail on Sunday reporter’s phone records without his consent, despite laws protecting confidential journalistic sources. 

The Government has also announced a review of the introduction of time limits on police bail. Some journalists accused of phone hacking and other offences have been left on police bail for more than two years.

Viscount Rothermere, chairman of DMGT, publisher of the Daily Mail, warned last month of an ‘anti-Press climate’ and said journalists were being ‘crushed by the full weight of the law’ – in sharp contrast with ‘those in the City whose greed almost caused our entire banking system to collapse’.
