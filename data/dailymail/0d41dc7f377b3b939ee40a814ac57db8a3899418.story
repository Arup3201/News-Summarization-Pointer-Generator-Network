Soaring numbers of counterfeit condoms are being smuggled into the UK, the government's health regulator warned yesterday.

For the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulation Agency claims that millions of the fakes have been illegally imported in the last 18 months.

The bogus condoms use cheaper materials and could increase the risk of users passing on STIs or lead to unwanted pregnancies, warn family planning experts.

Surge in demand? Millions of fake condoms have been illegally imported in the last 18 months

Counterfeiters have managed to copy well-known brands like Durex to convince people that the fake products are the genuine article.

BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat reported that tests carried out on many of the fakes show they have a high burst rate.

Senior investigator Danny Lee-Frost says: 'These products are made in the Far East for pennies and then sold over here for pounds.

'They will cut corners. They will cut costs. They will use cheaper ingredients and materials.'

He said it was vital that people only bought condoms from reputable retailers and pharmacies as the fakes have mainly been found on sale in corner shops and on market stalls.

Trading Standards are regularly intercepting fake hauls across the country. In August 2012, Â£1.5m worth of counterfeit condoms were seized at Heathrow Airport, with a similar amount found in Yorkshire.

The MHRA have employed the help of the UK's first sniffer dogs trained to try to tackle the problem.

Paul Maddox is responsible for the 
dogs' training. He told the BBC: 'I was really surprised when I found 
out about the problem. I've heard about counterfeit medicines but I 
never thought condoms would ever be an issue.

'When
we've trained the dogs up we managed to find a chink in the 
counterfeiters' armour and we've exploited that. That's why the dogs 
have been successful.'

But while the dogs can tell the difference, authorities are worried unwary shoppers could easily fall for the realistic fakes and want to raise awareness of the issue.
