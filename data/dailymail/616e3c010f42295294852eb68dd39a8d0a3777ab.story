Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has raised hopes that he could play some part against Swansea on Saturday after training with his team-mates.

The Belgian was pictured running, doing work with the ball and even sliding in on midfielder Fernando after recovering from a calf injury.

Kompany missed his side's 2-2 draw with QPR prior to the international break after hurting himself in City's Champions League defeat by CSKA Moscow.

But after being ruled out of Belgium's 0-0 Euro 2016 qualifier with Wales last Sunday, the 28-year-old didn't appear to be suffering as joined in with the rest of Manuel Pellegrini's squad on Thursday.

Kompany was joined by the likes of Sergio Aguero,Yaya Toure and Joe Hart in training, all of whom returned unscathed from from international duty.

Spanish midfielder David Silva was also pictured at City's session but the former Valencia star is unlikely to be risked against the Welsh side as he continues to recover from a knee injury.

Silva took part in light training but could be saved for next week's home Champions League clash with Bayern Munich.

Pellegrini's men must beat the Bundesliga giants if they are to have any chance of emerging from Group E and reaching the knockout stages. 

Striker Edin Dzeko and left-back Aleksandar Kolarov are both expected to be out until next month with calf injuries.
