A new BBC documentary has revealed the daily front line battle between  pro-choice and anti-abortion campaigners in Northern Ireland.

Separate laws to the rest of the UK mean that abortion there is illegal unless a woman’s life is in danger, even when the baby has no chance of survival.

In the Republic of Ireland, the law is similar, but there is the added rule that an unborn foetus has the same rights as the pregnant woman.

A new TV show reveals the battle women face to have an abortion in Northern Ireland and the Republic Of Ireland, including Tara, pictured, from Cork, who had to spend £1,000 to travel to London to undergo a termination

The law means 5,000 women from Ireland travel to England every year to undergo a termination.

Despite the law already working in their favour, pro-life campaigners like Youth Defence frequently organises rallies through busy town and city centres, brandishing placards that are plastered in pictures of unborn foetuses.

Not content with the rules already in place, these groups are trying to change the minds of pregnant women who may be considering travelling the hundreds of miles to a place like London, where a termination will be legal.

But there is a growing movement of opposition in the country – of young men and women who want to change the laws on abortion.

The BBC documentary, called Abortion: Ireland's Guilty Secret? follows four women as they show how the current law in the country has affected them.

In the show, the presenter meets 16-year-old Gemma from Belfast, who is an active member of the pro-life group Youth Defence.

Gemma, 16, from Belfast is a pro-lifer who campaigns against abortions every week in the city centre

Every weekend, Gemma and her friend Aiden erect a stall in Belfast city centre that host a range of pictures and lie-size models of unborn foetuses.

Gemma’s fervour comes from her belief that she is representing the voice-less – the babies that can’t speak up for themselves.

For her, there are no exceptions, including if a woman has been raped.

She tells the cameras: ‘No, because one child is never any more important than another.

'I think that not killing a human life is far more important than for a woman to choose if she wants to have a baby or not.'

In the rest of the UK, abortions up to 27 weeks were legalised for women in 1967 because of growing concerns about the highly dangerous backstreet terminations that were taking place.

In England, Scotland and Wales, women can get a termination on the NHS if they decide that they are unable to cope with a child.

But in Ireland, women can face up to 10 years in prison for undergoing a termination.

This law means thousands of women every year are forced to pay for flights to England and to pay for their termination.

Pro-Life Campaigners gather in Merrion Square, Dublin, as Ireland prepares to legislate and introduce regulations to allow abortion if there is a real and substantial risk to a woman's life, including the threat of suicide.  In January 2013

The TV show visits the home of a young woman in Cork, who has fallen pregnant with her live-in boyfriend’s baby, despite being on the contraceptive pill.

Tara has invited the cameras to follow her on her journey to Ealing in west London to undergo her termination because she wants to show how difficult the laws in Ireland make it for young women like her.

She says: ‘Someone needs to tell their story - there are women having to go over on a daily basis to England for an abortion, yet nobody is talking about it, all the same.

‘The stigma that's attached to it, the fact that you have to actually leave the country for it. 'I'm just not ready to have a child, we're not ready.

'I think that I can offer so much more to a child ten years down the line than now, that's what I want for me and that's what I want for my future kids.

‘I'm sure there are people out there who will think that I am the devil for doing this but I know it's the only option that seems right to me right now.'

Tara and her boyfriend then spend £1,000 on flights, accommodation and medical aid on a 24-hour trip to London to undergo the termination.

Despite putting on a brave face, Tara is visibly shaken when she leaves the centre where the abortion took place.

Tara says: ‘I feel really but I also feel guilty for feeling relieved at the same time. It's surreal.

'I’d love to be at home just cuddling my dog now, in my own bed. It has been a long day and it has been tough.

'I feel really angry that they're ignoring women (at home in Ireland) at the moment and ignoring the fact that they should have this choice.

'This could have been so simple, it could have happened two weeks ago when I found out.

'They shouldn't have control over my uterus - I deserve that choice and it was taken away from me by my government.

'You deserve to be treated as a human and not as a criminal.’

Despite the very strict laws in the country, some women are fighting back.

The programme meets a pro-choice campaigner who is actively promoting abortion in Northern Ireland.

Suzanne, 25, from Belfast recently graduated from university and is training to become an adult education teacher.

She had an abortion two years ago by purchasing pills over the internet that started a miscarriage.

She is now putting up stickers in her local neighbourhood directing other women to the site, so that they can also go through with a termination if they can’t afford the costs involved in travelling to the UK.

She said: ' I have a British passport but it is completely different to a British passport of someone in London, because I cannot have an abortion in an NHS hospital.

‘I have to travel.

‘The only way that things will progress here is to show that the law is completely unworkable.' 

Abortion: Ireland's Guilty Secret? is on BBC3 tonight at 9pm.
