The number of immigrants coming to Britain to work has fallen by 100,000 under the Coalition, new figures have revealed.

Between 2010 and 2014 just over 600,000 foreigners came to work in the UK, down from 725,000 between 2005 and 2009 under Labour.

The revelation, from the respected Oxford-based Migration Observatory, comes despite a recent surge in migration which has blown apart David Cameron's election pledge to slash the number of immigrants coming to Britain.

Mr Cameron pledged to reduce net migration – the difference between people moving to Britain and those leaving each year – to less than 100,000 a year by 2015.

But Britain's booming economy has seen a sharp increase in the number of migrants from the EU coming to work in Britain – with net migration surging to almost 300,000 according to the latest official figures.

However, the Migration Observatory has revealed that taken across the five-year parliament there has been a 16 per cent fall in the number of foreign workers moving to the UK

Madeleine Sumption, director of the independent observatory, said the migrant workforce was 'considerably smaller' now than five years ago.

The data, revealed in the FT this morning, also shows that since the coalition took office there has been a rise of 40 per cent in workers from recession-hit nations in the 'old EU', such as Italy, Spain and Portugal.

However, at the same time there has been a 35 per cent fall in migrants from the eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004.

There has also been a drop of more than a quarter in those arriving from beyond Europe.

The observatory's data show that migrants' wages have risen on average by 17 per cent under the coalition, compared with the previous five years — a significantly higher wage boost than British workers have enjoyed.

London meanwhile has taken a much larger chunk of immigrants - in professions such as financial services, and away from lower-skilled roles elsewhere in the country.

David Hanson, Labour's shadow immigration minister, said that while highly skilled foreign workers made positive contributions to the UK economy, there needed to be better training so that British workers could take on skilled roles. 'Labour has a strong plan to build the skills of the next generation.'

But Ukip's Steven Woolfe said: 'There are now close to 2m EU workers in the UK, and their numbers have more than doubled since [the accession of eight eastern European countries in] 2004.'
