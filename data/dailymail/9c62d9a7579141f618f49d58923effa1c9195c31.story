Jorge Alberto Lopez Amore, 28,  jumped from a cruise liner off the coast of Brazil 

A Mexican football fan who had been toasting the success of his team at the World Cup jumped to his doom from a cruise liner as he tried to impress a fellow female passenger.

Jorge Alberto Lopez Amores, 28, was on the deck of the cruise liner MSC Divina when he plunged over the railings into the ocean below last Wednesday.

Shocked passengers alerted the ship's crew which slowed the massive vessel and turned it around to look for him.

But
 the manoeuvre took over an hour and by the time the ship had returned 
to the spot where he took his dive he was nowhere to be seen.

The
 son of a wealthy lawyer, Mr Amores was one of 3,000 people aboard the 
ship that is cruising around Brazil, taking in football matches 
en-route.

He reportedly cried out 'Look at me!' before jumping to his death. 

Pepe Guardilo, a fellow passenger, said: 'I saw him chatting up a pretty female journalist aboard the ship. 

'He was animated, a result of too much booze and the team doing so well so far in the tournament.

One of the last photos that Mr Amores uploaded on his Twitter profile show him on the boat

'I heard him say to her: 'I am so happy that I can fly! Look at me!' And with that he stuck his arms out and dived overboard.

'The ship was moving at a fair clip and he vanished into the foam created in the ship's wake.

'By the time the ship had stopped and turned around, he was nowhere to be seen.'

Brazil's
 coastal waters are filled with dangerous currents not to mention 
sharks, with government officials in some coastal areas increasing 
lifeguard numbers and erecting signs in English to warn World Cup 
tourists about sharks.

Although the Brazilian navy has joined in the hunt for Mr Amores, the chances of him being found alive are slim.
