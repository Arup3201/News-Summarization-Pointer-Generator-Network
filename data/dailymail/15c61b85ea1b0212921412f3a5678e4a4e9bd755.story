A group of climate change protesters who occupied one of the UK’s new gas-fired power stations for seven days have avoided jail sentences.

Twelve women and nine men aged 23 to 46 from across the country admitted aggravated trespass after their sit-in at the EDF Energy West Burton power plant in Nottinghamshire last October.

At an earlier court hearing the group had been warned that all sentencing options were open, but at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court today district judge Leo Pyle told them custodial sentences would not be imposed.

He said: 'It is right to say that I took into account the conscientious motives of all of you.'How this case is sentenced must be fact-based.'

The judge said many of the defendants were highly educated men and women who had caring roles in the community, and added: 'Your motives were genuine but you knew what the boundaries were.'

Following the announcement that the defendants, some of whom had previous convictions for similar offences, would not be going to prison they cheered and broke into applause in the court room.

The campaigners from the No Dash for Gas group arrived in vans at the site in the early hours of October 29 last year.

Equipped with climbing equipment and with enough food and drink to sustain them for a number of days, they made their way on to the premises through a hole in the security fence.

They had planned the demonstration for around 10 months, and the action saw 16 activists occupy the flues of two of the chimneys at the site.

While up there, they rigged a rope between the two chimneys and people were able to travel across and operate a supply line.

They all handed themselves in to police at various points during and after the week-long protest.Prosecutor Colette Moore told the court: 'Five of the group were on the ground and detained in that way, the rest came down in the course of the next seven days.

'They were all detained quite peacefully, quite amicably.'

The group said they were protesting against moves to build new gas-fired power stations such as West Burton, warning they would leave the UK dependent on a polluting and increasingly expensive fossil fuel for decades.

The Government has backed the development of up to 20 gas-fired power stations as part of its strategy for future energy supplies.

Ministers said that continuing use of gas without technology to trap and permanently store carbon emissions is compatible with targets to cut greenhouse gases to tackle climate change.

Arrests were made between October 29 and November 5, when the week-long protest came to an end.

Five defendants were given an 18 month conditional discharge and ordered to pay costs of £85 and a £15 victim surcharge.

Seven others were given community orders for 12 months and told to carry out 200 hours unpaid work.

The remaining nine were were all given community orders for 12 months and told to carry out 150 hours unpaid work.

They were all told to pay costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £60.

David Rhodes, defending the group, told the judge the defendants had asked him to pass on that the demonstration was not done on a 'whim' and had been carefully planned.

'The defendants have asked me to convey this was not a stupid prank, nor was it a self-aggrandising stunt,' Mr Rhodes said.

'Each of these defendants cares passionately about the damage being done to the planet by climate change.

'It’s something that drives them very deeply. This was something that had been considered very carefully.'

The group considered the protest 'necessary', Mr Rhodes added.

'The sincerity in the integrity of their motivation is the most important mitigating factor,' he said.

The defendants had spent weeks planning and practicing the protest and their climbing techniques, it was non-violent, and no permanent damage was caused, Mr Rhodes said.

Asking the judge to not impose custodial sentences, he said some similar cases of political protests had seen individuals 'vindicated by history' and the defendants had acted out of the 'highest possible motives.'

He told the judge: 'These people must be marked out from the ordinary defendants who come before these courts on a daily basis because they come from conscientious motives.'

In his sentencing remarks the judge said the 'mass act of aggravated trespass' had resulted in the loss of around £340,000 in labour after 655 workers were turned away from the site during the occupation, and delays in finishing the site cost around £5 million.

A statement released by EDF following the sentencing said: 'EDF Energy’s civil case against the protestors was settled in March after they agreed to accept a permanent injunction preventing them from entering multiple EDF Energy sites.

'Following this agreement, the company dropped its claim for civil damages against the protestors.'EDF Energy has invited a range of groups and individuals - including No Dash For Gas - to discuss the company’s response to such demonstrations in future.

'This is being led by Will Hutton, Chairman of EDF Energy’s independent Stakeholder Advisory Panel, alongside panel member, Tamara Ingram.

'They will also be supported by an independent legal adviser.

'An advisory report will be presented to the Panel and the findings will be published in due course.'We share the protestors’ commitment to tackling climate change.

That’s why we have committed to reducing the intensity of CO2 emissions from our electricity production by 60 per cent by 2020, and cutting the proportion of CO2 arising from our customers’ energy consumption by 15 per cent by 2020.

'We are Britain’s largest generator of low carbon electricity and our plans to build four new nuclear reactors could generate enough low carbon electricity for about 40 per cent of Britain’s homes.'

Speaking after the sentencing, Rachael Thompson said: 'Although - thank goodness - none of us are going to jail, we are still facing penalties for simply standing up for clean, safe and affordable energy.

'Meanwhile, everyone in the country will be facing a disastrously destabilised climate and rocketing fuel bills if we don’t stop the Government’s reckless dash for gas.

'The Government is putting the profits of the Big Six energy companies before the fundamental need for a safe and liveable climate for generations to come.'
