While most eyes were on the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe choices during the family's time in Australia and New Zealand, she wasn't the only royal setting sartorial trends.

Much like his mother, Prince George used his first Royal tour to prove he's quite the trendsetter, with a plethora of stylish outfits.

Designers of the clothes he has worn over the last fortnight are reporting a huge surge in sales thanks to the 'George effect', and at just nine months old the royal tot has become something of a fashion icon.

One
 such example is the Les Petites Abeilles romper suit he wore on his arrival in 
Sydney - a similar design totally sold out immediately and now has a shipping time of two months.

The young prince looked 
dapper in the nautical-style romper suit as he disembarked an 
Australian Airforce jet last Wednesday.

He
 was blissfully unaware of the furore he caused but within seconds of 
the royal trio arriving in Australia, Twitter was awash with commentary 
about his ensemble.

Dressed to impress! On a playdate in New Zealand earlier this month, Prince George looked adorable in these Rachel Riley dungarees, which subsequently sold out in two sizes

Meanwhile others believed that it looked like a dress. One commentator remarking: 'Wonder how much George's dress was?

While another stated: 'Prince George 
proves the smocked romper suit with peter pan collar has never gone out 
of style for royal babies.'

But
 the cool, calm and collected prince appeared more than comfortable in 
the white romper with sailing boat embroidery as the world rushed to 
emulate his style.

The same happened when he 
visited a play group in New Zealand.

British luxury brand for children, which retails at £77 (AUD$125).

backpack, which the Duke of Cambridge was seen carrying on Monday after 
it had been gifted to his son in Sydney, reported the item had sold out

Trendsetter: The Duchess of Cambridge holds Prince George as they say goodbye before they board their flight in Canberra at the end of their Royal tour, in which George cemented his status as a style icon

CEO
 Deborah Tabart said the sudden rush of orders for the kangaroo bag, 
which was selling for £7 (AUD$12.50), was a result of Prince William
 seen carrying one.

But little George's effect on buying power was evident even before the tour.

Following the family's portrait for Mother's Day this year, when the prince 
sported a baby blue number with 'George' emblazoned on his chest, personalised baby clothes retailer 
My1stYears.com sold 1200 jumpers in just four hours.

Spot the difference: Princess Diana was photographed with baby William wearing a similar outfit to George

Fit for a prince: Stockists of the bag said it sold out hours after the Duke of Cambridge was pictured holding it

The Prince George effect has brought a welcome boost to the high street as copycat clothes fly off the shelves.

The term 'The Prince George effect' was coined just three days after his birth when the
 £20 printed white aden + anais cloth in which the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge wrapped their baby son before leaving the Lindo Wing of St 
Mary's Hospital sold out almost instantly.

'A
 style icon is someone who creates a trend and with his nautical 
stripes, dungarees and baby grows with royal blue piping he certainly 
doing that' - Nick Ede, Style expert

Founder of Blue Almonds Izabela Minkiewicz, said: 'Kate has already had a major impact on the fashion market with the dresses that she’s pictured in flying off the shelves as soon as they hit stores so she’s destined to have the same effect on the baby wear market, too.

'When Kate was photographed in Blue Almonds whilst pregnant, interest in Moses baskets definitely increased and sales of similar infant beds have also boomed. More recently I’ve had a number of parents bringing in clippings of pictures of George and asking for similar styles - they even ask if I can order the exact pieces in.

'Kate earned her style-icon status in no time at all and with shoppers trusting her choices, the clothes she picked for George are set to be the pinnacle of children’s style.'

Style and brand expert Nick Ede added:
 'It’s refreshing to see that he’s not too trendy he’s just the perfect 
English gent. The George effect is due to him wearing clothes that are 
not designer labels but are wearable, affordable, on-trend colours and 
perfect for the royal spotlight.

'A
 style icon is someone who creates a trend and with his nautical 
stripes, dungarees and baby grows with royal blue piping he certainly 
doing that.'

Here's to a fashionable future!
