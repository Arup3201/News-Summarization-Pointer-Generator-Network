The rusty Falklands frigate HMS Plymouth on which Argentinians surrendered has set sail for the last time after it was consigned to the scrapyard.

The Royal Navy ship set sail from Birkenhead docks in Liverpool at around 7.30am this morning and is thought to be heading to a port in Turkey to be turned into scrap.

Campaigners have battled to save the Type-12 frigate, which served in the Far East before its role in the Falklands War in 1982, for 25 years since it was decommissioned in 1988.

Royal Navy ship, HMS Plymouth, pictured leaving Birkenhead docks in Liverpool where it has been moored for over a decade, served in the Far East before its role in the Falklands War in 1982. It set sail at 7.30am this morning for its final journey and is thought to be heading to a port in Turkey where it will be scrapped

In
 its glory days, HMS Plymouth, which was launched at Devonport Dockyard 
in Plymouth on July 20, 1959, sailed to South Georgia with the Royal Marines
 and SAS aboard where she provided naval gunfire support in the 
Falklands War. Argentine forces also surrendered - signing the 
document in the HMS Plymouth wardroom

Members of the HMS Plymouth Trust, set up in 2012, had raised money to launch a legal action to have the ship ‘arrested’ and prevent it from leaving Vittoria Dock, where she has been left to rust for years.

Peel Ports, which owns the docks, said it had no ‘practical choice’ but to scrap the vessel and said it would not confirm its final destination.

The firm has issued a statement which said it is ‘very sympathetic to the historical significance of the vessel’ but that no public or private body has come forward with a feasible plan to maintain, restore or remove her during the past seven years.

It added: ‘We have no expertise in the preservation and restoration of historic ships and given the fact that she is deteriorating further at berth, the group feels, reluctantly, we have no practical choice but to dispose of her responsibly.’

The 2,150 ton vessel, the last Rothesay class type 12 Frigate afloat, was launched on July 20,1959 at Devonport Dockyard in Plymouth by Viscountess Astor and after sea trials and fitting out, commissioned into the Royal Navy on May 11, 1961.

She sailed to South Georgia with Royal Marines and SAS aboard in 1982 where she took part in the Falklands War.

After engaging the enemy, the ship provided naval gunfire support, and the Argentinian garrison at Grytviken then surrendered with Lieutenant Commander Alfredo Astiz signing the surrender document in the wardroom of HMS Plymouth.

The ship went on to provide cover for the aircraft carriers and amphibious vessels and was the first vessel to enter San Carlos Water where she was attacked and damaged herself by five Mirage fighter jets.

After returning to Rosyth for repairs in July 1982, she had steamed 34,000 miles, fired over nine hundred 4.5 inch shells and destroyed five enemy aircraft.

Peel Ports said the Historic Warships Preservation Trust rented a berth for HMS Plymouth in 1990 within the East Float, Birkenhead from the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company but when the Trust went into liquidation in 2006, HMS Plymouth became, by default, their legal responsibility.

Peel said they understood Plymouth City Council attempted to acquire the vessel and display her in the city's docks in 2007 but this was abandoned when no suitable berth could be found.

Freelance photographer David Billinge, 57, captured images of the warship while it was docked prior to its departure from the River Mersey this morning.

He said: ‘It’s a very sad sight to see such an iconic ship in such a state. It has been very badly neglected in recent years and is covered from top to bottom in rust. There’s so much history behind the ship which is why campaigners have fought so hard to preserve her.

‘It’s a real shame to see the vessel being consigned to the history books like this.’

Social media users described the scrapping of the warship as a ‘sad’ event.

Stuart Miller said: ‘A lot of history in that ship, sad that she is going to be scrapped.’

Phil Owen wrote on Twitter: “#HMSPlymouth on way for scrapping, a sad end for any vessel #F126 #RoyalNavy.’

More than 50 seamen who served on board the historic vessel paid their last respects in a moving ceremony held in May 2012 – to mark the 30th anniversary of the end of the Falklands War.

Speaking at the ceremony, Captain David Pentreath, the ship’s Commanding Officer during the Falklands War, said: ‘Her spirit will survive and the friendships forged over her long life will continue to flourish. Sadly the ship is now showing her age, but her reputation as a happy and successful ship is as strong as ever. This day is tinged with sadness as you make your fond farewells.’

He has previously condemned the decision to scrap HMS Plymouth, saying it was ‘an indication our country doesn’t seem to have much interest in the preservation of maritime heritage.’

The historic vessel has served in a variety of locations in its lifetime.

In its early years HMS Plymouth sailed to Australia to take part in the Cook Bicentennial celebrations at Sydney Harbour in 1970. It also stopped at various ports including Albany, Port Adelaide and Port Kembla.

On its return she sailed across the Indian Ocean before heading for a six-week tint on Beira Patrol. The crew had few distractions and the local ferry was a chance to show off the ship turning in tight circles to make her presence known.

She had bow equipment damaged in a strong storm as she headed into Simonstown in South Africa at the end of her duty – on the same stay two members brought drugs on board which were confiscated on the ship’s arrival in Plymouth.

Another tour saw the frigate travel around the UK stopping at ports including Stornoway and Middlesborough.

In 1982 HMS Plymouth was one of the first Royal Navy ships to arrive in the South Atlantic after Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands and South Georgia.

Her Westland Wasp helicopter was badly damaged during Operation Paraquet on April 28 and she rejoined troops on the ground by bombarding Argentine troop positions with her 4.5inch guns.

Five men were injured in an attack on June 8 when the ship was attacked by Dagger fighter bombers of the Argentine Air Force.

Her wardroom was where the surrender was signed by Lieutenant commander Alfredo Astiz and the ship returned to Rosyth Dockyard after the war for a full repair and refit.

A year later she served as the West Indies guard ship and in April 1984 was involved in a collision with another ship and in 1986 suffered a boiler room fire, which killed two sailors.

She was decommissioned on April 28, 1988 and was the last type-12 in service. In 1990 she was towed to Glasgow and went on display at a berth on the River Clyde before being relocated to Birkenhead’s Great Float.

On 6 February 2006 the Warship Preservation Trust closed after going into liquidation and six years later it was announced that she has been sold for scrapping.
