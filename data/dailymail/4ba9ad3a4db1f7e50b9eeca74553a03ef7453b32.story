Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen knows what it is to be desperate. 

He's spent the last ten years behind Indonesian bars as one of the Bali Nine, arrested in 2005 for trying to smuggle 8kg of heroin from Bali into Australia. 

Now, as fellow convicted drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran await word of their looming executions, the 'forgotten' Bali Nine prisoner is desperately trying to raise funds for an appeal against his own life sentence. 

'No one wishes death,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I have a life sentence, that means life in Indonesia. That's death by a different means.'

'If you believe in mercy': Forgotten Bali Nine drug smuggler Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen asks for help from Indonesia

After ten years of silence behind bars, 31-year-old Nguyen has launched an online My Cause campaign in an attempt to raise money for the legal costs of his latest appeal, which will be heard with fellow prisoners Si Yi Chen and Mathew Norman.  

'By the time you read this there may only be seven of us left,' Nguyen wrote in his online call for help. 

'Today, as I sit in my jail cell and watch the way the Indonesian government is handling the execution of my fellow Australians, I am terrified,' he said.

'Terrified for their situation, distraught for their loved ones and agonisingly certain I will be next.' 

Nguyen has penned a letter of thanks to those outside prison walls who have sent him messages of support since he spoke out, saying he is overwhelmed. 

'Thanks for having faith in me. It had been a long journey,' he writes. 'The words you wrote to me was really something different. Thanks for your time also in lending a hand. Thanks for giving me a chance to prove myself. A second chance.

'For the first time, not sure how to go about, but this is me asking for help to fight an unknown system,' he writes. 

'Thanks again for your time in writing encouraging comments to me. It makes me more determined.' 

Money raised will be used to cover costs for all three men, and any remaining funds will be donated towards legal costs of the remaining Bali Nine group, also fighting for their lives.

Nguyen and his family know well that another appeal could be risky. Following a previous attempt in 2006, the Indonesian Supreme Court increased his sentence to the death penalty, before reducing it again to life in prison in 2008.

'For five years I appealed and never had a chance. During one appeal my sentence changed from life to death,' Nguyen writes. 'But desperation has driven me to try again. A roll of the dice – for my life.'

'Am I guilty? Yes. Am I sorry? More than anyone will ever know.'  

Bali Nine drug smuggler Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen has spoken for the first time about his life in prison

Nguyen was in Kerobokan prison with Chan and Sukumaran until last year, when he was moved to Malang prison in East Java with fellow Bali Nine drug mule Martin Stephens.

He says the pair on death row are 'good guys.'

'They dealt with their sentence in the best possible way they could,' Nguyen says. 'The facts are there, they did help others. No one is making that up; everything said about them is true. They were good guys and have helped endlessly.'

Indonesia's hard-line stance on the executions of  Chan and Sukumaran have made Nguyen fearful he and the other Bali Nine members won't be given a fair trial when it comes to the appeal.

But while they are still alive, he says, 'we have hope.' 

This week, lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran are pushing ahead with their last-ditch appeal against the Administrative Court's decision to deny the pair an opportunity to challenge President Joko Widodo. The appeal has been adjourned until next week.

Of the mood in prison in Indonesia at the moment, Nguyen says Malang is 'a different place.'

'The people are different. They are really polite and respectful and are giving me the space I need right now,' he says. 

'But what's happening affects me more, because I know those two [Chan and Sukumaran] while none of these people do, so life continues as normal for them. Like nothing is happening.' 

Nguyen told the Daily Mail his family visit when they can, but that it's far now and hard on them financially.

Asked what it's like to see his family, he says: 'it is hard to answer this.'

'I'm happy seeing them, truly I am, but it's also a reminder about the pain and problems I caused them.'

Nguyen says his family, who migrated to Australia as refugees from Vietnam, have spent all their life savings on his legal costs over the last ten years and are still paying those debts.

The Indonesian Supreme Court increased Nguyen's sentence to the death penalty in 2006

If he were ever successful in winning a reduced prison sentence, Nguyen says there are 'so many things' he wants to do. 

One of his biggest regrets is the shame he has brought to his family and the heartbreak his situation has put them through. 

'The most important to me is to fix the relationship with my family,' he says. 'I live with that regret every single morning when I wake and every night in my noisy bare jail cell as I try to sleep,' he says.

'I tell you now, there isn’t any code of honour among drug dealers and in the end it will destroy you and everyone around you.' 

The Bali Nine consists of nine Australians who were arrested in Indonesia in 2005 for a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of the country and into Australia

Nguyen says there are many things he took for granted growing up in Australia.  

'It wasn't until my arrest that I realised the things I took for granted. Basic things as living conditions. Growing up in Australia, we are fortunate. So we truly don't know the meaning of poverty at home.'

In prison, Nguyen says he is trying his best not to lose hope, waking early each day to train and box at the gym and read. He is also teaching English to other prisoners and encouraging them 'to work through their problems at the gym.'

'Also what's important for me is do is everything I can so people would never have to go through what we have by being involved in the drug trade,' he says.

'But I must say, in all honesty, even though that's what I want to do, nothing is certain in life. After more than ten years inside, nothing is the same. The world I knew once isn't the same.' 

The 31-year-old has been through a legal rollercoaster since being sentenced in 2005 (here with fellow Bali Nine members)
