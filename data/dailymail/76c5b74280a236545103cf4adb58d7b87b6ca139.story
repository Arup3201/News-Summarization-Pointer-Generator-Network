A speeding car crashed into a Swiss border barrier and then flew 45 metres over the top of a building before crash-landing the other side.

The driver survived the dramatic collision on the Swiss-French border and suffered only a minor hand injury.

The Audi sedan spiralled out of control after smashing into the roadside barrier.

The driver of the black Audi sedan miraculously survived the crash that saw him fly 45metres through the air

The sedan flew through the air for 45metres over a five-metre high customs official's building

The car was propelled more than 5m into the air after smashing into the roadside barrier

It was then propelled into the air and soared over the customs officers' building, which is five metres high, and then flipped in mid-air.

The car then crash landed on the other side after travelling a total of 75metres. 

It had been going faster than the 40mph speed limit.

Pictures of the car after the late night crash on Friday show severe damage to the front driver's side and large dents in the bumper.

However the driver was virtually unscathed and no one else suffered any injuries.

The crash happened at the Thônex-Vallard border crossing between France and Switzerland.

The Swiss Border Guard was quoted by The Local as saying that the car was travelling at an 'excessive speed'.

The statement added: 'By a miracle, there was no serious injury to report.'

The flight of the car was demonstrated by a graphic released by the guard service.
