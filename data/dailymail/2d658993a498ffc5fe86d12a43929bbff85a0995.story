Ben Phillips, NATSEM’s principal research fellow, said youth unemployment was up because of the weak labour market in Australia at the moment 

Shocking new research has revealed that young Australians are four and a half times more likely to be unemployed. 

Experts have blamed the disappointing outlook on a 'weak labour market' and young people not having enough experience when they are looking to get on the career ladder.  

The financial services company AMP and National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling Work It Out report has been released today.

Youth unemployment is at 27 per cent compared to overall unemployment in Australia at six per cent.  

Ben Phillips, NATSEM’s principal research fellow, told Daily Mail Australia: 'It's fairly startling. 

'Youth unemployment goes up and down in relation to how the economy is doing. 

'The economy in Australia has not been as strong as years past so it is not surprising that those struggling to get jobs are those young people who are less educated and with less experience. 

'They are competing against more experienced workers in the job market and they are going to lose that battle. 

'Youth that are unemployed are always the ones that struggle, the numbers are pretty nasty at the moment. It is concerning to have young people who have fallen through the cracks. 

'The government needs to focus their policy on the young and make sure they are getting the right training. 

Times are tough: The report says Australians under the age of 20 are finding it tough to get jobs

'The concern is that if they stay unemployed for a long time it can lead to more serious troubles. 

'There are many young people who have just graduated and not all of them manage to get a job in their desired field. 

'Australia has got a reasonably weak labour market and graduates are competing against people from other universities, it is a difficult time for graduates. 

'There is not a huge amount that the government can do in a weak economy because there are lots of people looking for jobs.

 'The best thing governments can do is to ensure young people have the best education they can get and they get the experience they need, we need to get the youth in those training years.' 

The numbers of 15 to 19-year-olds looking for full time work has soared in recent years 

The report uncovered that double the number Australians in their twenties who hold a degree, are still working as sales assistants or in hospitalities, than any other age bracket, reports news.com.au.

Paul Sainsbury, AMP’s Chief Customer Officer said 'it's a tough environment for many young people looking to get their foot on the career ladder'

Statistics in the report show that unemployment for 15 to 19-year-olds who are hunting for full time jobs has soured to a high of 27.1 per cent in September this year, this is up from 16.6 per cent in 2008.

Paul Sainsbury, AMP’s Chief Customer Officer, told Daily Mail Australia 'it's a tough environment for many young people looking to get their foot on the career ladder'. 

He added: 'As the report shows it’s can be a catch-22 because employers are looking for people with experience, yet young people can’t get that experience without a job.

'It’s quite staggering when you look at how many young people are out of a job compared to the rest of the workforce.'
