An artist has transformed ugly run-down public structures into works of art by camouflaging them into their background using paint.

Dutch designer Roeland Otten has used mosaics, geometric paint designs, and high resolution photograph wall coverings to recreate the otherwise blocked and lost views of the city streets.

He has managed to turn an air quality measuring station, an electricity substation and a public toilet in Amsterdam into artistic creations.

Now you WC me, now you don't: Dutch designer Roeland Otten likes to brighten up urban streets by camouflaging misplaced public structures

How to lose loos: Public buildings are decorated from all sides so the optical illusion works from all directions

His aim is to disguise eyesores on picturesque urban streets and pathways and rejuvenate the area by doing so.

His City Camouflage project, featured in Dezeen magazine, includes a pixelated view of Jan van Galenstraat shopping street in Amsterdam using tiles.

Otten's project began in 2009 with the transformation of a former electricity substation on the corner of Graaf Floristraat and Heemraadsingel in Rotterdam.

Blended in: If it wasn't for the car that has been placed to the side of this artwork, you would struggle to see it wasn't real

Drive to distraction: The clever artwork involving these parked cars makes you forget there is even a building there

Acrylic paint is used to transform a rusty electricity substation on the Boompjeskade waterfront in Rotterdam

He decorated the building in sheets of aluminium printed with high-resolution photographs of the surrounding streets, so that it seemed almost invisible among the houses and trees.

Last year he used acrylic paint to transform a rusty electricity substation on the Boompjeskade waterfront in Rotterdam.

The bold graphic paintwork makes the substation blend in with the water and foliage nearby.

An old public toilet building used to measure the quality of the air was used for another part of the project, which you can find out more about atÂ www.roelandotten.com.
