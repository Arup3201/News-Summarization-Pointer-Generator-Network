One of the youngest sex offenders to be arrested for assaulting an adult has been sent on a sex education course.

The 11-year-old Romanian boy forced his hands between his victim’s thighs after confronting her while she was out shopping.

The boy, who has now turned 12 and cannot be named because of his age, then rode off on his bicycle.

North London Youth Court has found an 11-year-old Romanian boy guilty of sexual assaulting an adult woman

He denied sexually assaulting the woman but was found guilty following a trial at North London Youth Court.

The boy had given police a variety of different addresses before they tracked down him and his family.

District Judge John Perkins handed him a nine-month youth rehabilitation order - the juvenile equivalent of a community order - and sent him on an educational course.

Broad daylight: The assault took place in the early afternoon on Wycombe Road in Tottenham, North London

He said: ‘This was an unpleasant offence, and you continued to deny that you did this when in my view, the evidence was overwhelming.

‘It clearly caused great distress to the young woman concerned, and because you showed no remorse and did not admit it she had to come to court to tell me about it.

‘You show a low risk of further harmful behaviour, and you have never done anything like this before.’

The boy, who is not in school and spends his days cycling around the streets with friends, smirked as he left court with his parents, who were ordered to undergo childcare training.

The youngster committed the assault in the early afternoon of June 26 this year in Wycombe Road, Tottenham, north London, after approaching the victim and saying ‘hello’.

Prosecutor Lorna Ewen said: ‘He then, with his right hand, moved towards her and grabbed her between the thighs before cycling off.

‘The victim called the police and she pointed him out to them as the person who assaulted her.

‘He dropped his bike and was chased by the police. When later interviewed, he admitted being present but denied any sexual assault.’

The boy, who lives in Manor Park, east London, was given a nine-month youth rehabilitation order with a supervision requirement and told to attend a programme with the youth offending team for six months focusing on sexually harmful behaviour.

His parents were told to complete a six-month parenting course and encouraged to get their son into education.
