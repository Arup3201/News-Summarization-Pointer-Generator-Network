A new ISIS propaganda video has emerged on social media showing the indoctrination and training of dozens of child soldiers from Kazakhstan.

Entitled 'Race Towards Good', the video was produced by the terror group's main media branch, Al Hayat Media Center. The dialogue in the video interchanges between Kazakh and Arabic, with three sets of subtitles including English.

The high quality film opens with a slow motion sequence of two lines of armed Kazakh adult fighters jogging along in the desert. In between the two lines, a lone fighter wearing a peaked hat can be seen riding a white horse and carrying the black flag of ISIS.

ISIS has released a shocking new video featuring children from Kazakhstan at a terrorist training camp

Their teacher claims he is giving the children an education before they move onto military training

The video immediately cuts to a young boy, pictured, field-stripping and rebuilding  an AK-47 assault rifle

All of the fighters are wearing matching grey camouflage uniforms, with the exception of the leader of the group who is wearing a black tunic. 

The video claims: 'Meet some of our newest brothers from the land of Kazakhstan. They responded to the crusader aggression with their hijrah and raced to prepare themselves and their children, knowing very well that their final return is to Allah.'

One of the Kazakh fighters said: 'These brothers made hijrah recently and they're now in training camp. They are preparing themselves to fight the kuffar (non-believers) and the mushrikin (polytheists) who are spreading their kufr and shirk, and to fight the tawaghit (sinners) in their various forms.'

The propaganda video shows a group of new adult ISIS recruits from Kazakhstan training in an assault courses and receiving specialist sniper training. Ranging in age, the adults are also shown in a classroom being taught about the firing range for different sniper rifles - including weapons from the United States.

The video states that 'soon they will be ready to join the army of the Islamic State' before shockingly revealing the role of Kazakh children in ISIS.

The video shows the youngsters shouting God is Great in Arabic. 

The video states: 'They begin their days in search of knowledge in the schools of the Islamic State where they are taught to hold firmly to this creed. This is coupled with a resolve forged in the midst of worldwide crusader aggression, which together form the ultimate base for raising tomorrow's mujahidin (fighters).'

The video shows the children learning how to read and write in a classroom before military training 

It also shows Kazakh men receiving instruction in the use of sniper rifles and other infantry tactics 

Unlike the recruits, the sniper instructor is masked as he teaches the men how to deal with range

The young boys are shown catching the bus to their religious school. One of the boys mimics pointing a rifle towards the camera whilst others recite ISIS slogans.

The boys are then shown being taught the ISIS radical interpretation of Sharia'h law in a classroom. A Kazakh cleric is shown sitting in the classroom, where he tells the camera what it means to be a Kazakh in the Islamic State. 'We spent our childhood far away from this blessing. We were raised on the methodology of atheism, and Allah's refuge is sought.'

He goes on to denounce the West, claiming 'the kuffar poisoned our minds.' He insists 'Our children are happy. They're living in the shade of the Qur'an and Sunnah.'

After showing the Kazakh boys being taught to interpret the Qur'an and learn how to read and write Arabic, the children are shown undertaking military training.

The video cuts to the youngsters undergoing the same military drills practiced by the men 

It is shows the young boys developing their hand-to-hand combat skills in the classroom 

The propaganda video shows a toddler brandishing a toy sub-machine gun while wearing military fatigues

The boys are shown sitting in a group and are all wearing matching camouflage fatigues. One of the boys shows off his ability to strip apart and reassemble a machine gun whilst the other boys watch on with little interest. 

The scene is narrated by an interview with the children's Arabic teacher, who claims: 'They will move on to do physical and military training until they get older and pound the thrones of the tawaghit. With Allah's permission, they are the next generation. They are the ones who will shake the earth and spread this precious deen (religion) to all regions of the earth.'

The child soldiers are then shown carrying out gun manoeuvres and tactical formations. It also briefly shows shots of the boys working out in the gym and practicing martial arts.

One of the Kazakh children, who gives his name as Abdullah, is asked in an interview what he is doing. The boy replies: 'I'm training in a camp.' When quizzed about what he will do in the future, Abdullah chillingly declares with a smile: 'I will be the one who slaughters you, O kuffar (non-believer). I will be a mujahid, insha'allah (God willing.)'

The boy is then shown as part of the Kazakh boys brigade sitting as a group. A toddler, wearing a balaclava is seen tottering nearby, carrying a mock machine gun and wearing military fatigues. One of the older boys leads a prayer before proclaiming the group's message: 'We're going to kill you, O kuffar. Insha'allah we'll slaughter you.'

At the end of the chilling video, one of the children is interviewed and explains that he is 'training in the camp'

He then explains how he will go on to kill people claiming that he will become a fighter 

The final scene shows the boys jogging with their rifles along a road like the adult fighters at the beginning of the video. The video's final statement reads: 'These youth are honoured with being the future flag bearers of Islam.'

It is thought that at least 300 Kazakh nationals have travelled to Syria and joined Islamic State, according to the National Security Committee of Kazakhstan. Nurtai Aykayev, chairman of the committee, wrote in a report that 150 of the 300 Kazakh nationals, who had joined Islamic State, were women. 

Dr Andreas Krieg, Assistant Professor at the Department of Defence Studies in Kings College London said Kazakhstan was not a target area for ISIS. 

He said: 'They are currently concentrating on Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen. Although recently Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi recently said he was looking to franchise the organisation in different Muslim countries. 

'Teaching the foreign fighters Arabic is very important to them as they want to be able to win hearts and minds of the people in their core target areas. The reason they are training children, is the same reason the like of Hamas have been training children for the past 20 years. It is to indoctrinate them and create the next generation of fighter.' 

Dr Krieg said the reason young men from Kazakhstan were willing to join ISIS is similar to those prompting British people to travel to Syria and Iraq. 

'Kazakhstan is a reasonably stable country. These men, like those in Britain and other western countries are disenfranchised by the society they live in. They are very susceptible to the ISIS narrative.' 

Iraqi Shiite militia have joined with regular Iraqi forces around Tikrit, northern Iraq to fight against ISIS 

The combined forces have had several successes against ISIS forces who had taken over the area 

The major counter attack is believed to have killed 'tens of terrorists' in reclaiming a northern enclave

Meanwhile, ISIS has murdered 25 members of a Sunni Muslim tribe in the Anbar province in Iraq. 

The bodies were discovered by members of the Iraqi army on the eastern edge of the Iraqi provincial capital Ramadi. Local officials believe the men were murdered because they opposed the ISIS incursion into their territory. 

Hathal Al-Fahdawi, a member of the Anbar Provincial Council, said the bodies of the men, who are from the Albu Fahd tribe, were discovered after the Iraqi army launched a counter-offensive against ISIS. 

He said: 'While they were combing the territories they are liberating, security forces found 25 corpses in the Shujariya area 

Albu Fahd tribal leader Sheikh Rafie al-Fahdawi said at least 25 bodies had been found and said he expected the total to be significantly higher. He said the bodies were found scattered around with no signs of weapons next to them, suggesting they were not killed during fighting.

Last month ISIS killed hundreds of members of the Albu Nimr tribe in Anbar in an attempt to break local resistance to their advances in the Sunni Muslim province they have largely controlled for nearly a year.

ISIS has also been attacked in the Anbar province where Iraqi troops have been supported by US air power

ISIS, which has seized control of large parts of Syria and Iraq, continues to gain territory in Anbar despite three months of U.S.-led air strikes launched against the group.

On Friday it launched coordinated attacks in central and outlying areas of Ramadi in an attempt to take full control over a city which is already mostly in its hands.

The road from Ramadi to the military airbase of Habbaniya, about 15 miles to the east, remained under ISIS control on Saturday, Hathal Fahdawi said, preventing the army from reinforcing security forces in the city.

He said tribal fighters backed by army tanks were trying to secure the road to allow forces through from Habbaniya.

The ISIS lightning offensive through northern Iraq in June plunged the country into its gravest security crisis since the U.S.-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003, and raised concerns that its radical ideology will spread.

In northern Iraq, a farmer near the city of Mosul discovered around 60 bodies believed to be those of prisoners killed by Islamic State fighters when they overran the city's Badush prison on June 10, witnesses said on Saturday.

The bodies were found after heavy rain disturbed their mass grave. The United Nations said up to 670 prisoners from Badush were killed by Islamic state five months ago.
