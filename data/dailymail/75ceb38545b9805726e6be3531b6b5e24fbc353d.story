Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian all had famously short lived marriages.

Although the duration of their relationships, which lasted from a matter of days to just a few months, may be shocking, the reasons for their splits come as no surprise - unlike the ream of depressing admissions submitted to Reddit.

A post on the online community website asked users to share the reasons their marriage had ended with a year of their wedding and it was met with a shocking deluge of terrifying marriage stories.

On a Reddit thread, hundreds of people disclosed why they divorced within a year of getting married

From simply drifting apart to drug addiction and even  gender identity disorder, the discussion thread includes more than 200 responses with fascinating and honest accounts of early divorce.

Here we select some of the most astounding anecdotes from those who have experienced the horrifying reality of breaking up within a year of marriage.

Christmas crisis

We met and fell I love while I was stationed in Georgia. We were engaged and she moved back to Louisiana with me. After about six months, she started acting weird. I asked what was wrong but got no straight answer.

I offered to call off the wedding, but she insisted that she loved me and wanted to stay with me. We were married on Thanksgiving day. On Christmas Eve, she admitted to cheating on me during our engagement. 

I spiraled into a terrible dark depression. We tried to make it work for about a year. As my depression lifted, I realized that my resentment buried any love that I had for her. She cheated again and I left her.

Although some of the reasons seemed pretty normal, such as drifting apart, others were far more shocking with drug addiction and domestic abuse being flagged as causes for several posters 

As simple as that

She started loving someone else. Worst 90 days of my life. 

He tried some cocaine and that was it 

My ex-husband and I had been best friends for seven years. According to everyone we were soulmates. Well we were madly in love and finally started dating, then moved in together, and after a year or so said our 'I dos'. 

One month after we were married he went out drinking with some friends. He tried some cocaine.. .and that was it. 

He became a severe alcoholic and drug addict. He drained our accounts, stole every penny, destroyed our house, violently threatened me, and finally disappeared. Then he overdosed and spent months in rehab only to continue his habit the minute he got out. 

This sounds like a white trash love story right? He was actually from a wealthy, upper class family, was endlessly kind and loyal to us, very well educated. It was a complete shock to all of us with this behavior. 

He is still a junkie to this day. We were only married eight months from 'I do' to divorce day in court. It still breaks my heart to this day.

Spiritual prompting 

My sister had a friend that got divorced really quickly after her marriage (six months I think). The whole thing was rushed. They dated for less than a year. 

She married him because she was religious and thought she was receiving a spiritual prompting. After the marriage they didn't act like newlyweds at all.

Little to no holding hands, when they were sitting on a couch they had a foot of space between themselves, etc. It wasn't long before they realized it wasn't going to work out.

In one case a woman admitted that her husband had used the internet to find men for sex 

Hidden addictions 

A friend of mine from university got divorced after three months because of her husband's addictions that he failed to mention - cocaine and finding gay men for sex on Craigslist. 

I say that the second was an addiction because he was picking up like three dudes a week on average. 

Counselling turned to coupling  

My mother got divorced six months after her first marriage. They were having problems, went to a marriage counsellor who told my mom that her husband needed one-on-one counselling but that my mom was fine and could go home. 

After their divorce finalised, another wedding with the marriage counsellor was in the works.

The fling attended the wedding

My future ex-sister-in-law invited her boyfriend to her wedding to my brother. We didn't realise who he was at the time. 

Forced into it

My parents threatened me and my ex saying we were living 'in sin' because we were living together and not married. 

I was married at 18 and divorced at 19 because he wouldn't stop beating the s**t out of me. Thanks mom and dad! 

Had we just been DATING I would have just moved my s**t out of the apartment and been done, but instead I had to go through hell to get a divorce. 

Poor laundry skills

We got divorced seven months after our wedding. We had rough times but who doesn't? He was a cheater and very good at talking his way out of trouble. 

We had an argument about him not trying in our relationship while I was at work. I came home later that night and then told me we needed a divorce because I don't know how to put away the laundry. 

He also said he fell out of love with me and we were never meant to be. A few months later comes to find out he left me for someone else. Better off without him. 

Living a lie

Neither of us realised he wanted to become a woman until six months into the marriage when he hit me out of frustration with his own body.
