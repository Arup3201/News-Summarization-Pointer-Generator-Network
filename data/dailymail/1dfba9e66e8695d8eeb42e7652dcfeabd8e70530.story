Vladimir Putin is under pressure to put 'peacekeeping' troops on the ground in Ukraine as NATO accused the Kremlin of posing 'a threat to the international order'.

Separatists supporting Moscow in eastern Ukraine called on the Russian president to put soldiers into Donetsk and Lugansk regions to maintain order. 

A call for peacekeeping forces also came from the head of the Russian parliament's defence committee Admiral Vladislav Komoyedov.

Russia's upper house today approved a Putin demand to remove his authority to deploy his armed forces in Ukraine, but the calls for peacekeepers indicate many have not ruled out its troops on the ground in eastern Ukraine. 

The Kremlin leader has been seen as backtracking this week to avoid harsh new Western sanctions, but the latest demands will disturb leaders in the EU and US.

Donetsk separatist leader Pavel Gobarev urged: 'We ask for the deployment of a Russian peacekeeping contingent in the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic.'

In the event of international peacekeepers, Putin's forces 'must play the leading role', he said.

Komoyedov warned that the week-long ceasefire was not holding in eastern Ukraine, highlighted by the downing of a Ukrainian military helicopter in which nine died.

'Who can at present reliably control the situation between sides to the conflict in southeast Ukraine? I think that an interposition force could fulfill this task,' he demanded.

Deep in conversation: Nato has accused Moscow of breaking the rules and eroding trust through its actions in Ukraine

NATO head Anders Fogh Rasmussen refused to see Moscow's moves as bringing a solution to the crisis. 

Through its actions in Ukraine, Russia 'has broken the rules and eroded the trust,' he said.

It is Moscow's 'illegal actions in Ukraine which pose a threat to the international order'.

NATO has accused Russia of increasing its troop numbers close to Ukraine's borders and proving weaponry and fighters to rebel forces.

'Today, we see no changes in Russia's behaviour. So we have no options but to maintain the suspension of practical civilian and military cooperation. '

'There will be no business as usual with Russia until Russia comes back into line with its international obligations.'

On military exercises in Russia this week, forces are conducting drills in 'peacekeeping' tasks.
