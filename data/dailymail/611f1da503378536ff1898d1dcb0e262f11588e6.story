California pastor Danny Goia and wife Daniela claim they've received a sign from god in the ghostly image of a veiled woman hovering in the background of a photograph.  

'I can clearly see the face,' Daniela said. 'I can even see the long hair. I can see, like a veil that covers all the way to the floor.'

The couple, who preside over First Romanian Pentecostal Church in Anaheim, said the photograph came to them through a member named Radu.

Signs: Could this picture of a factory worker have captured the image of an emissary from God?

Sign from above: A California pastor believes this photo captures and angel and is a 'sign from God'

Man of faith: Pastor Danny Goia said the picture was shown to him by a newly baptized member of his church

Radu declined to appear in person for television news crews, but explained that he had taken a picture of a co-worker at an Irvine warehouse two weeks ago and saw the figure floating over the man's shoulder.

Radu claimed not to have altered the image in any way.

Radu and his wife were recently baptized at the church and married later that day.

Fact or fiction? The photo was taken at a warehouse as a man was trying to take a picture of his co-worker

'The next day was when this photo was taken,' Daniela told CBS 2.

'God is trying to reveal to the people before something major will happen,' Danny Goia added.

Preacher: Goia has shown the image to his flock and warned them to right themselves with God

The pair believe that the image is both a message from God and an angel watching over their new member.

Danny Goia presented the image to his flock on Thursday during church service, admonishing them to prepare for big events. 

'God wants to say, 'Hey, get ready. Get well with me because something good is gonna come soon,' he said.
