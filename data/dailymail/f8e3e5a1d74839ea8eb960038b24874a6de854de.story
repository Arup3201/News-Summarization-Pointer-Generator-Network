Rebekah Brooks has moved to America to lead Rupert Murdoch’s hunt for new online investments, it can be revealed.

The former News of the World editor has made the permanent switch from Oxfordshire to New York, with husband Charlie and three-year-old daughter Scarlett.

She has been put in charge of finding promising internet start-ups for News Corp to invest in.

It ends a period out of the public eye after the phone- hacking scandal. An insider said: ‘She is still trusted and very much held in high regard by Murdoch.

'This is a high-status job at the top of the business.’ News Corp declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.  

In November speculation Brooks was to rejoin the company were rife after she was seen at its New York offices. 

Staff confirmed the former editor had visited the Sixth Avenue site as she continued to 'explore her future' in the news industry. 

'She and her family are here in the United States for a visit, reconnecting with friends and meeting with businesses as she explores and considers her professional future,' a spokesman for the company told the Guardian last year. 

While the company has not publicly confirmed her new position sources claimed Ms Brooks had already moved from London to Manhattan with her family. 

It comes after bosses Rupert Murdoch and Robert Thompson boasted of the company's digital acquisitions at its Annual Meeting in November.

Addressing shareholders, Murdoch, 83, said: 'The creation of the new News Corp has given us an opportunity to innovate.  

'We are purposeful in our pursuit of new businesses and have the potential to change the world as we know it.   

Thompson, who was reportedly overheard by an Australian journalist last year speaking of 'another redhead I'll have to worry about,' added: 'We told you on our investor day that we would become more digital and global and resolutely kept that vow. 

Brooks, 46, was cleared of charges of phone hacking in 2014 

'We acquired for a very modest price the world's leading social news agency for video, Storyful.. and are now integrating Harlequin Books at Harper Collins.'  

'Tomorrow we are due to close on our acquisition of Realtor.com. This will give us a remarkable opportunity to profit from the digitization of the US real estate market. 

'We are absolutely intent on fashioning an ever more rewarding future for our audiences, our employees and for you our investors.' 

In December the company announced it had acquired Indian education start up Big Decisions after taking a large share in the real estate company, Proptiger. 

It is understood to have bought Storyful for $25million while its acquisition of Realtor.com's operator Move Inc is said to have cost $950million. 

In June Brooks was sensationally cleared of charges in the high-profile phone hacking investigation which saw other News International employees jailed. 

During the trial she revealed a six-month affair with co-defendant Andy Coulson who was sentenced to 18 months behind bars.

After rising through the ranks of Murdoch's media organisation Brooks became the youngest ever editor of News of the World when appointed in 2000 aged 32. 

Three years later she was moved to the helm of the Sun and promoted again in 2009 to an executive position. 

When several of the organisation's journalists were arrested on suspicion of phone hacking and making illegal payments, Murdoch rushed to her side in the UK, reportedly describing the flame-haired 46-year-old as 'his top priority'. 

She resigned from News International in June 2011 two days before being quizzed by police herself. 

After being acquitted in June 2014 following a 138-day trial at the Old Bailey, she told reporters gathered outside her London home: 'I am innocent of the crimes I was charged with. I feel vindicated by the unanimous verdicts.'

During the sensational trial of News of the World journalists much focus was afforded to how Brooks was able to rise so quickly through the ranks of Murdoch's organisation. 

Having started work as as a newsroom secretary, many are said to have questioned her abilities when  the 83-year-old Australian appointed her editor of the now defunct News of the World in 2000 aged 32. 

Even the criticism of his son, James Murdoch, is said to have been ignored by the media mogul. 

What Brooks brought to the organisation was an uncanny ability to schmooze. Having wormed her way into the Chipping Norton Set - a group of high placed politicians and businessmen and women living in Oxfordshire - she became a regular fixture at dinner parties given privately by prime ministers. 

At her 2009 wedding to old Etonian Charlie Brooks, a racehorse trainer, David Cameron and Gordon Brown were among guests. 

She had already charmed the showbiz set through a failed marriage to EastEnders actor Ross Kemp whom she was accused of giving a fat lip in an explosive domestic tiff which ended in Brooks being arrested. 

So close was the Cheshire-born Brooks to David Cameron the politician ended text messages with 'LOL'. It is unclear whether he meant 'lots of love' or 'laugh out loud' in his cryptic sign-offs. 

But while politicians and public figures distanced themselves from Brooks after her 2011 arrest and subsequent trial, Murdoch remained a loyal fan and confidante. 

He is said to have rented a property near the Old Bailey for the 46-year-old and her legal team. 

So undeterred was her tendency to preside over others that even as her 'car crash' personal life was revealed in open court, the harem of lawyers working around Brooks referred to her as 'HM' - Her Majesty. 

And while details of her 'car crash' personal life were agonised over in court - jurors were told of her struggles conceiving a baby and were read an excruciatingly personal letter to her former lover, co-defendant Andy Coulson, Brooks remained defiant. 

Upon her acquittal she told reporters she had been 'vindicated' by the trial's outcome but insisted on learning 'valuable lessons'.
