A summer holiday may involve months of anticipation, but Brits have revealed the precise moment they relax while abroad.

It takes travellers exactly three days to switch off and relax – with the happiest point on a trip abroad pinpointed to the third day at 7.30pm.

By this point, most holidaymakers say they have stopped thinking or worrying about work and still have plenty of days left ahead to enjoy, according to a survey by www.sunshine.co.uk.

And relax... Brits says it takes them three days to switch off while on holiday

Nearly 1,800 adults were questioned about their last week-long break in the past year.

The majority said they felt most relaxed on day three of their trip at 7.30pm because they had had enough time to stop thinking about work (42 per cent).

The second most popular reason was that they still had enough of the holiday left to enjoy (31 per cent), followed by it being the most enjoyable day (26 per cent).

Thirteen per cent of Brits cited this point as their best time in the holiday as they had started to get a good tan, while nine per cent said they were pleased they still had holiday spending money left.

However, some 67 per cent of those taking part in the poll admitted to feeling ‘extremely sad’ on the day that they had to return home from their holiday.

And 5 per cent of these even claiming to have become upset to the point of crying. 

Nearly half of the respondents claimed that their last holiday abroad had a positive effect on them once they had returned home. 

When asked to explain this further, 37 per cent said they ‘decided to work less/not stress as much’ and 26 per cent said they ‘decided to get finances in order’ following a holiday.

Some 13 per cent said that the holiday had a positive effect on their relationship with their significant other once they had returned home. 

Chris Clarkson, Managing Director of sunshine.co.uk, said: ‘There’s a magical moment on all holidays when you can sit back, finally forget about work and look forward to the rest of the days you have left before returning home. It really is a great feeling. 

‘The first couple of days on holiday can be taken up with office-related worries, or recovering from travelling. 

‘Once you’ve had time to settle into your holiday and let go a little, it’s a chance to really enjoy your break.”
