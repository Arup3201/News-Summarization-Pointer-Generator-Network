Close: Michael Gove pictured with Dominic Cummings in the background

Michael Gove’s closest ally launched a withering attack on David Cameron last night – and accused him of holding back vital school reforms.

Dominic Cummings said the Prime Minister lacked ‘the slightest sense of purpose’ and had failed to give Mr Gove the backing he needs to drive through reforms aimed at revolutionising school standards.

He mocked Mr Cameron as a ‘sphinx without a riddle’, and warned the Prime Minister is ill-served by ‘sycophantic’ advisers who fawn over him and refuse to challenge him when he is wrong.

‘To get anything done you have to have priorities, and there are no priorities,’ he said. ‘Everyone is discouraged from telling the truth to important people. There’s no grip, no focus.’

The incendiary claim will infuriate Downing Street, which is losing patience with Mr Gove following a series of bruising rows that have damaged the Government.

Earlier this month, Mr Gove was forced to issue a written apology to Mr Cameron and a senior Home Office official after briefing against Theresa May’s approach to countering extremism in schools.

In one of the worst bouts of Coalition blood-letting, Mrs May was forced to sacrifice her special adviser Fiona Cunningham after she leaked a letter in which Mr Gove hit back at the Home Secretary.

Mr Cummings, a frequent critic of the Coalition, quit as Mr Gove’s special adviser in January but continues to visit the Department for Education to offer advice.

Friends describe the pair’s continuing partnership as being ‘like Batman and Robin’.

In an interview with the Times, Mr Cummings said he regretted the fact that the Government’s education reforms had not moved ‘faster, further, better’.

Mr Cummings, who had frequent rows with civil servants while in post, laid the blame for slow progress mainly on a ‘dysfunctional’ department.

But he said Mr Cameron lack of vision and support had also contributed.

‘As Bismarck said about Napoleon III, Cameron is a sphinx without a riddle,’ he said. ‘Everyone is trying to find the secret of David Cameron but he is exactly what he appears to be – there’s no mystery to him. He had a picture of [Harold] Macmillan on his wall – that’s all you need to know.’

Mr Cummings, who spent six years working alongside Mr Gove, said many of the Prime Minister’s most senior advisers were ‘far out of their depth’, had ‘no grip’ and were out of touch.

Mr Cameron’s Old Etonian chief of staff Ed Llewellyn was described as a ‘classic third-rate suck-up-kick-down sycophant presiding over a shambolic court’.

Mr Cummings was also scathing about Mr Cameron’s director of communications Craig Oliver, a former BBC journalist.

The Gove and Cameron families are close, but the Prime Minister is said to be becoming exasperated with his old friend’s growing habit of becoming involved in unnecessary rows. Downing Street reluctantly accepts there is little Mr Gove can do to control Mr Cummings’s outbursts.

But the personal and high-profile nature of his latest attack will cause anger.* In a separate development last night, it emerged that children as young as five are to be taught about business in a bid to produce a generation of entrepreneurs. 

Mr Cameron is expected to support plans for a major overhaul of the curriculum to promote business.

The changes, proposed by Tory grandee Lord Young of Graffham, will include teaching children about the importance of profit and encourage them to be more entrepreneurial.
