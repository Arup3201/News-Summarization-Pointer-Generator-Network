Chelsea goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer believes it will take 'two or three people to drop dead' before FIFA realises Qatar is unsuitable to host the 2022 World Cup.

Earlier this week, the European Club Association proposed the tournament be played in January and February to avoid the sweltering summer temperatures, which often exceed 40 degrees Celsius.

Qatar was awarded football’s premier international competition in December 2010 but the decision has been marred by controversy surrounding corruption and the country’s suitability to host.

'People complain about it being too hot. I’ve played World Cup qualifiers there in June, and it is hot. I played a game in Oman in June one year and it was 43 degrees,' Schwarzer told the Leaders in Sport conference in London,

'Something needs to happen to stop games at that time of year. It is just ridiculous, and it will only happen once probably not just one person, but two or three people drop dead.

'That’s unfortunate, but that’s probably the only way they will do anything. It’s ridiculous, it really is ridiculous to be playing at that time of year and I don’t why there’s even a debate.

'A committee went out there and said it was not safe to play, yet they were still awarded it.'

FIFA president Sepp Blatter insists Michael Garcia’s report into allegations of bribery during the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups will not be made public.

Blatter’s objection to the report’s publication adds to a widespread feeling of disenchantment with FIFA, which Schwarzer describes as a 'shame'.

'I find it really, really disappointing to see a global body that has so little trust globally, from anyone - even the members of the game,' Schwarzer said.

'And now there’s this Garcia report. Why conduct a report if you are not going to make it open? If you want trust in FIFA, surely you should open the report and say ,’here it is’.

'Open it up to the public, open it up to everyone so we can see how FIFA is run. If it is run incorrectly, then we can change it.

'It is such a shame to see football being run how it’s being run, with so little trust.'
