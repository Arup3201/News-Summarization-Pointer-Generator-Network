The inferno that killed four people and injured eight as it burned an iconic Jersey Shore motel to the ground Friday was caused by a cigarette tossed into a chair, authorities said.

A cigarette discarded into a chair in a designated smoking area at the Mariner's Cove Inn, a two-story motel in the family resort town of Point Pleasant Beach, is what caused the deadly inferno, officials said. They do not know who is to blame.

The announcement came two days after officials announced Saturday that DNA testing will be needed to identify the four people burned to death in the fire. Occupants were staying there after Superstorm Sandy had washed away their homes.

Fire investigators said they do not believe the fire was started intentionally, and are not sure if one of the four people charred to death in the resulting blaze is to blame They may never find the culprit, but were quick to say the investigation is only beginning.

'This is only the beginning of an 
intensive investigation aimed at answering the many questions 
surrounding all the circumstances that contributed to the tragic deaths,
 injuries and loss of property,' a fire official said.

The announcement came only one day after it was announced that the remains of the four people killed in the inferno will need to be identified using DNA testing.

The early Friday morning blaze also injured eight others. An additional 10 people originally declared missing have since been found.

Officials weren't ruling out the possibility that the 10 had escaped before the fire engulfed the Mariner's Cove Motor Inn in this popular summer resort town at around 5.30 a.m. All the missing occupants have now been accounted for and 9 of them are safe.

The wooden building was overwhelmed by flames by the time firefighters arrived, and at least one person leaped from a second-floor window to escape. Three people were injured critically.

Investigators interviewed motel management, and determined about 40 people were staying there when the fire broke out, Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph Coronato said. The motel's office was destroyed and many records were lost, he said, making an accurate accounting difficult.

Raging: The out-of-control blaze burned the motel to the ground and took yet another home away from dozens staying there since Superstorm Sandy washed their houses away

Now just a memory: The shabby motel had long hosted families seeking a cheap place to stay for their weekends near the beach and boardwalk in the seaside town about one hour south of New York City

Coronato said authorities hope the 
missing hotel occupants had simply gone elsewhere to stay with 
relatives, or to another motel, and asked them to check in with police.

'We are trying to make sure they are safe and unharmed,' he said.

Survivors described a chaotic scene of flames, smoke and screaming.

Peter
 Kuch said he smelled smoke and opened his door to find a lounge area 
engulfed in flames. He dialed 911 to seek help, and by the time the call
 was completed, the flames were at his door and licking at the windows 
of his second-floor unit.

He decided to jump.

'I
 had to, there was no other way out,' he said. 'My window was only open 
an inch and flames were already starting to come through it. There just 
was no other choice.'

Yet another tragedy down the shore: This fire happens only months after another fire burned down the famous Seaside Heights boardwalk, and many of the same fire investigators who worked that blaze are on the scene of this one

He suffered a sprained ankle but said he was otherwise all right.

Joe
 Frystock was one of the Sandy victims who was staying at the motel, 
which like many others in this normally quiet resort town about 70 miles south of New York City, relies on people seeking low-cost
 rentals during the slow winter season.

His home in nearby Brick 
Township took on 6 feet of water during the October 2012 storm, and the 
motel was the latest in a series of temporary homes for him.

Frystock,
 who is diabetic, said he frequently has to use the bathroom at night. 
He woke up to popping sounds, which he initially thought was gunfire.

'It was the sound of timbers burning 
upstairs' he said. 'I looked out and saw that orange glow, and there 
was no mistaking what it was. People were yelling: 'Help me! Help me!' 
There was lots of screaming.

The fire decimated the motel leaving nothing but crumbling remains behind

A woman in the unit next to me, they pulled
 her from a bathtub, but I don't know how anyone could have survived 
those flames. The entire second floor was engulfed, from one end to 
another.'

That woman, who 
had sought refuge in a shower and kept the water running while waiting 
to be rescued, was pulled from the bathroom by one firefighter, who 
handed her out a window to another firefighter, who carried her down a 
ladder to safety.

The woman was taken to St. Barnabas Medical Center, a 
hospital about an hour north that specializes in treating severe burns, 
which Coronato said she had suffered.

Denise Dougherty, the motel's housekeeper, said she was awakened by screams.

'There were people yelling, 'Help me! Help me!' and other people yelling, 'Jump! Jump!' It was terrible.'

Shawn Wardell said a strong wind 
was fanning the flames across the second floor of the motel, where he 
had been staying with his cousin and grandparents.

'We
 got my grandfather out 'cause he's disabled, and by that time the whole
 second floor was just engulfed in flames,' he said. 'People were 
yelling and screaming.'

The Jersey shore motel was housing residents including Superstorm Sandy victims whose homes were destroyed

Investigators are currently    interviewing motel management to determine how many people were staying there when the fire broke out

Residents
 gave conflicting accounts of whether they heard smoke detectors or fire
 alarms sounding. Some said they heard nothing, while others said a fire
 alarm was blaring as the flames were sweeping eastward across the top 
of the building.

Authorities did not immediately identify the dead. Coronato said all three males.

The
 Ocean County Sheriff's Department said one of the injured included one 
of its detectives, who suffered a severe leg injury, including broken 
bones, at the fire scene.

The motel fire came only six months after a September blaze burned down part of the Seaside Heights boardwalk - which had been newly-rebuilt after also being washed away by the monster storm.

Many of the same fire investigators who worked the boardwalk blaze were on the scene of the motel fire.
