The pain of being ordered to pack his bags and fly home from Australia this winter persists but gradually the scars left by a tortuous year in the international wilderness are fading for Steven Finn.

Whisper it, but the 25-year-old is returning to the sort of form that made him one of the most potent young fast bowlers on the planet in his early twenties, only for self-doubt and too much well-meaning advice to scramble his brain and destroy his technique.

By the end of the disastrous 5-0 Ashes whitewash, a shell-shocked Finn — the only member of England’s squad not to feature in the series — was deemed ‘unselectable’ by one-day coach Ashley Giles and told to get on the next plane back to England.

Class: Finn, seen here bowling for Middlesex, is hoping to improve England's fortunes

Born: Watford

Age: 25

Height: 6ft7in

County: Middlesex (2005-)

Test debut: v Bangladesh (March 2010)

Tests: 23

Runs: 169

Wickets: 90

Best bowling: 6-125 v Australia (Brisbane, 2010); v New Zealand (Auckland 2013)

‘Even at the end of the tour I refused to admit that I should have been sent home,’ said Finn, speaking to The Mail on Sunday in his first major interview since the end of the Ashes.

‘I made someone else make the decision for me because I wasn’t willing to walk away from playing cricket for my country. You grow up dreaming of playing cricket for your country and I wasn’t going to throw the towel in on that opportunity unless someone made that decision for me.

‘It was frustrating. It was horrible. Standing at the back of my mark thinking “Where the hell is this going to go?” You lose all sensation of that feeling on the end of your fingertips. You lose it and you can’t find it. At worst, that’s what it was and at best it wasn’t much better.’

Finn’s problems began to surface following complaints by South African batsmen in 2012 that his quirky, if apparently innocuous, habit of accidentally breaking the stumps at the non-striker’s end in his delivery stride was putting them off. It prompted the MCC to take the unusual step of introducing a new playing condition in 2013 which now sees a ‘no-ball’ called whenever it happens.

Finn’s attempts to iron out the flaw had disastrous repercussions for the rest of his game and he played the last of his 23 Tests against Australia at Trent Bridge last year, when captain Alastair Cook refused to bowl him on the final day of a closely fought match.

‘People have been doing that [dislodging bails in delivery] for years, so to have a law made up just for me when people like Shaun Pollock had done it for years did seem a bit strange,’ said Finn.

‘It definitely affected my bowling. It made me rethink how I approached the crease, I started bowling wide of the crease, had to change my run-up and I’ve now had to rethink how I approach the crease coming straighter in.’

Finn strongly denies any suggestion that things got so bad in Australia as to be termed the ‘yips’. But he accepts there were times when he worried about releasing the ball, while his return to England saw him unpick his technique and go ‘back to basics’ with Middlesex bowling coach Richard Johnson in an attempt to resurrect his stalling career.

The pair use a clip of Finn bowling for England Lions in 2010 as a reference point, and both men believe his action is now back to mirroring that which saw him first called up as a 20-year-old capable of consistently touching 90mph.‘When I came back from Australia we literally went back to standing and bowling the ball into a net which was three or four yards away, trying to feel my arms moving like they used to,’ said Finn.

‘When you’ve not done it for so long, it feels so alien. Johnno was behind me saying “It looks really natural” and I’m there going “It doesn’t feel very natural, it feels terrible ... it feels like I can’t let go — not let go — but I can’t get it to where I want it to go”.

‘From the beginning of 2013 through to the beginning of 2014, I was working on things that were detrimental to me being a better bowler. Playing with a short run-up that made everything forced and made me force pace rather than just run in and naturally bowl quick, which I’d always done before that.

‘A lot of what happened knocked on from that, grooved bad habits and got me away from bowling like I had done when I was young. Now, it certainly looks and feels like I’m starting to get back to bowling very naturally like I did when I was a bit younger.’

Finn’s struggles Down Under led to suggestions of a rift between Middlesex and England bowling coach David Saker. ‘It was nobody else’s fault but my own,’ said Finn. ‘I was the one who made decisions at a stage in my career and I made the wrong ones.

‘None of this is anything to do with David Saker. It’s a player’s responsibility to make sure that your game’s in order. I tried my hardest to make sure that my game was in order in Australia, but it wasn’t. It took me taking a step back to realise what was going wrong to address it.’

And address it he has, judging by recent performances. He is the fourth leading wicket-taker in the County Championship Division One this season with 40 wickets at 28.47 and, perhaps more importantly, Finn looks to be attacking the bowling crease with the sort of gusto that saw him take 46 wickets in his first 11 Tests in his breakthrough year in 2010.

Finding his rhythm: Finn celebrates a wicket on Middlesex duty against Northampton

On Thursday, as England’s bowlers were toiling at Trent Bridge, the 6ft 7in quickie — back off his long run — looked fluid and relaxed in giving Somerset’s batsmen the hurry-up on an Uxbridge track admittedly containing more life than Nottingham’s dead dog.

‘As the season’s gone on I’ve felt the rhythm has got better,’ he added. ‘The most important thing is that I feel like I’m bowling well and that’s a feeling that eluded me pretty much all winter and most of last season. I’m back bowling well and I’ve no doubt the wickets will come.

‘What’s happened has happened. It’s in the past. I’m trying to look forward. But it would disappoint me and frustrate me greatly if my best years were when I was 20, 21, 22.

‘Obviously I want to play international cricket again and I think that I’d be ready if I was to get the call to play in a one-day international or a Test match or whatever.

‘But a lot of guys are ahead of me at the moment, and rightly so, so I want to let my bowling do the talking. I might have a few choice words for the batsman every now and again but other than that I don’t want to do any talking.’
