One of the top hospitals in the U.S. has confirmed the personal details of thousands of its emergency patients were accidentally posted online.

Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto, California, reportedly confirmed a privacy breach led to the shocking error that saw 20,000 patients’ details leaked.

The data, including names and diagnosis codes, was on a commercial website for nearly a year until the breach was discovered last month.

The hospital has been investigating how the data got from a vendor to a website allowing students to solicit paid assistance with their schoolwork.

A spokesman for Stanford Hospital and Clinics told the New York Times that the data first appeared on the site last September as an attachment.

Medical security experts said the breach highlights the vulnerability posed by legions of outside contractors gaining access to private data.

It comes even as government regulators strengthen their oversight by requiring public reporting of breaches and imposing heavy fines.

The data also included admission and discharge dates and billing charges for patients seen at the emergency room over a six-month period in 2009.

'It is clearly disturbing when this information gets public'

But it did not include Social Security and credit-card numbers or other information used to carry out identity theft, a hospital spokesman said.

‘It is clearly disturbing when this information gets public,’ he told the New York Times.

‘It is our intent 100 per cent of the time to keep this information confidential and private, and we work hard every day to ensure that.’

Diane Dobson, of Santa Clara, 
California, said her ‘jaw dropped’ when she read the hospital's 
letter addressed to her 21-year-old son.

He
 was treated at Stanford in 2009 and she said learning his name was linked to a mental health 
diagnosis may have ‘sent him 
over the edge’.

He added Stanford had concluded that there is no employee from the hospital who has done ‘anything impermissible’.

But the federal Department of Health and Human Services is now expected to carry out its own investigation.

The hospital is offering free identity protection services to affected patients and took ‘aggressive steps’ to remove the data, the spokesman told the New York Times.
