He's got a piercing stare, brooding expression and body that can whip female fans into a frenzy but for male supermodel David Gandy, he would prefer to keep his looks off-screen.

The Essex-born hunk, 34, who shot to fame wearing just his underpants in a Dolce & Gabbana campaign in 2006, is one of the most desired men on the planet and was offered the chance to play Christian Grey in Fifty Shades Of Grey.

But in an interview with Square Mile magazine he says that while he respects the film, the role - now played by Jamie Dornan - wouldn't have been right for him.

The model, who is well known for his smouldering M&S underwear ads, has revealed he turned down the role of Christian Grey in the Fifty Shades of Grey films

Disappointing his thousands of fans who would have loved to have seen him in the very steamy film, David said that the role didn't feel right for him and he doesn't feel the need to act 

'Critics and literary experts aren’t fans but I respect it for what it is. But was it right for me? No. It just didn’t feel right, in any way. And in my gut, it felt right to say no.'

The hugely successful model, who is currently the co-designer and face of a new M&S campaign, revealed that he has been offered, and subsequently refused, several lead roles in box office hits.

“I was offered Fifty Shades Of Grey, 300:2, Hercules, which a lot of people probably would have taken as actors but I’m in the fortunate position where I like what I’m doing. I don’t feel the need to act,' he said.

And, while his legions of admirers may be bitterly disappointed not to see Gandy in the role, which would have had him naked much of the time, it's hard to see how he could have fitted it in.

As well as a packed modelling schedule, Gandy has recently taken a step into retail. 

The model loved his pair of David Preston-designed Chelsea boots so much, he decided to buy the company.

In January the label had a soft launch at London Collections: Men, for which Mr Gandy is also an ambassador.

In an interview regarding his latest acquisition, the male supermodel, who has 230,000 followers on Instagram, told fashion website WWD: 'It was always my aim - which sounds really strange as a model - not to always be in front of the camera but to turn the other way and have an input.

'I don't just do one campaign and move on. I go in there, I look at the team and I want to help the brand move in a different direction.

Mr Gandy's plans for his new brand are to 'create a lifestyle' around the label and to think how men want to be seen in them. 

Similarly his personal life is going from strength to strength, and his relationship with Saturdays singer Mollie King keeps him busy outside of his work endeavors.

The couple, whose 10-month relationship came to an abrupt end in 2011, confirmed they are back together in October last year and seem to be taking things very seriously. 

And of course, Gandy's refusal led to former model Jamie Dornan landing the coveted role of Christian Grey. 

Despite the film having yet to be released, Jamie's star has well and truly risen since accepting the part of the S&M-obsessed billionaire.

Jamie, 32, who has a baby daughter with wife Amelia Warner, admitted that he is taking a laissez-faire attitude to his increasing fame, and how his life will change once the film is released on Febuary 13.

Taking to Variety magazine about his experience at the Golden Globes in January, he revealed: 'I’m astonished at how many people are telling me my life is going to change.

'Everyone that I meet, especially in LA. People who run studios or other actors or people who are strangers.

'Everyone has been saying that to me: "Are you ready?"I don’t have a good answer to that, because I don’t know what I’m meant to be ready for. Whatever happens, happens. I’ll just roll with the punches.'
