The man credited with discovering some of the biggest names in modelling has died at the age of 70.

John Casablancas, who launched the careers of Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell, lost his battle with cancer in Rio de Janeiro on Friday evening and will be mourned in a funeral ceremony later this week.

He launched Elite model management in 1972 and signed models such as Gisele Bündchen, Stephanie Seymour, Alessandra Ambrosio, Naomi Campbell, Heidi Klum, Eva Herzigová, Alessandra Ambrosio, Stephanie Seymour and Anna Nicole Smith.

John Casablancas, pictured with some of his models in 1991, was 'a man who loved women, lots of women'

The glamorous champagne lifestyle he 
encouraged his models to lead was largely at odds with the prevailing 
business ethos at the time. His rival agency Ford was pioneering a clean and ethical business practice within the modelling industry, introducing modern accounting practices and standardised pay and working hours.

'Models were just models,' Casablancas told New York Magazine in 2005. 'We started creating the myth behind the looks.'

He encouraged Cindy Crawford to strip for Playboy. That year, she became the world's highest earning model.

Linda Evangelista famously said 'We 
don't wake up for less than $10,000 a day' in 1990, a comment that came to 
define the supermodel era.

At its height Elite was earning up to $65 million in bookings per year. But as Casablancas' success in the industry rocketed throughout the 80s and 90s, it was also rocked by scandals.

In 1983 the businessman indulged in an affair with 16-year-old Stephanie Seymour, he was 41.

The fling ultimately ended his second marriage to Jeanette Christjansen, a former model and the 1965 Miss Denmark.

'I
had the understanding of a guy who loved beautiful women, and above all
who liked the sensuality of it all,' he said in a 2010 video interview 
with the blog Modelinia.

'All
of the other agents were either women or gay guys. They had their own 
approach, which in certain instances was probably superior to mine, but I
had something I thought was unique. I looked at my models as women.'

Casablancas was increasingly being faced accusations of engaging in relationships with underage models and resigned from his agency in 2000 following a BBC One undercover exposé.

The programme showed some of Elite’s European agents bragging about using drugs and having sex with young models.

He later turned bitter towards the women he helped dominate the catwalk, calling them 'spoilt pains'  surrounded by 'idiots and leeches'.

names a 'talentless German sausage'

He described Heidi Klum as a 'talentless German sausage' and Naomi Campbell as 'odious'.

He said, as reported by the Independent: 'Apart from Linda Evangelista, no supermodel has ever thanked me  when she got to the top.'

Casablancas died on Friday, as confirmed by Women's Wear Daily over the weekend.

He is survived by his young wife, 
Aline Wermelinger, a brother, Fernando, and by five children from his two marriage, including Strokes frontman Julian Casablancas.

'Elite World and The Society Management [a division of Elite World] are deeply saddened [by] Mr. John Casablancas’ passing,' said Stefania Valenti, chief executive officer of Elite World as reported WWD.

'As a man of extraordinary talent, Mr. Casablancas was instrumental in formulating the global success of the Elite brand. His vision changed the model management concept, driving the careers of iconic top models.'
