Torment: Robber Wayne Head wanted to escape the drug culture in his open prison, a court heard

A convicted robber fled from an open prison to get away from the rampant drug culture inside the jail which was destroying his life, a court heard.

Wayne Head, 35, blew his savings on so-called legal highs which were freely available in HMP Leyhill in Gloucestershire, a judge was told.

Head, who was described as a 'model prisoner' before his transfer to the Category D prison, walked out and returned to Plymouth, Devon, to visit family memorials at a local crematorium.

He handed himself in after four days at large following a police appeal. 

Head
was handed a four month jail term and is now in a more secure jail 
after he admitted absconding from lawful custody in August.

He had been locked up for more than six years after being handed an indeterminate sentence for a brutal robbery in August 2007.

Defence barrister Ali Rafati told 
Plymouth Crown Court that Head had been a model inmate before he was 
transferred to Leyhill open jail in April.

He said legal highs were circulating and after four months he had spent all his savings on the drugs.

Mr Rafati said: 'It was all too much for him and he stepped over the fence.'

He
eventually arrived back in his native Plymouth and visited the 
crematorium before a family member urged him to give himself up.

Head is expected to be transferred to Channings Wood jail at Denbury in Devon - only 35 miles from his home.

The judge, Recorder Malcolm Galloway told Head he may have harmed his chances of parole and release in December.

Prisons categorised from A to C are closed, means inmates are barred from leaving 

Category A prisons are for those deemed highly dangerous to the public.  

Category B jails are for those who do not require maximum security, but pose a significant escape risk.

Category C prisons are for criminals who are unlikely to try to escape.

Category D, otherwise known as an open prison, houses criminals who are not deemed a risk to the public and who are being prepared for release. Many are allowed to undertake work in the community or to go on 'home leave' while serving sentences.

He told him: 'They may have difficulty in concluding you are no longer a risk because of your escape.'

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'Anyone who absconds will be returned to a closed prison and may face further criminal charges.

'We take the illicit use of drugs in prisons, and the problems they cause, very seriously. We work hard to keep contraband out of prisons and use a range of security measures, including random mandatory drug testing of prisoners and working closely with the police.

'We are also supporting the Bill currently in Parliament which would allow prisoners to be tested for legal highs.'

Minimum security HMP Leyhill holds some inmates who were sentenced to life in jail. 

The prison is seen as one of the softest in the country, where prisoners are not even locked in their cells. 

Disgraced former Energy Secretary Chris 
Huhne was transferred from tough Wandsworth Prison to HMP Leyhill just seven 
days into his eight-month jail term for perverting justice when he got 
his wife to take his speeding points.

It has no perimeter security fence and has been in the headlines during recent years after a number of high profile escapes.

Easy access: Many 'legal highs', which are sometimes marketed as plant food or having other apparently harmless uses, are freely available online

In September, betting shop robber Timothy Stern, 31, begged officials at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire to let him come back after he escaped from Leyhill.

He claimed he wanted to return to the high-security jail to be closer to his family.

Stern’s good behaviour had seen him transferred to minimum-security Leyhill, near Bristol, in August.

But he walked out and turned up at his old jail 24 hours later asking to be let in.

Drug experts liken taking so-called legal highs to Russian roulette because users have little idea what they are being exposed to.

In August it was reported deaths involving legal highs increased by 80 per cent last year – to one every week.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show fatalities relating to the psychoactive substances rose from 29 in 2011 to 52 in 2012 – compared to 22 in 2010.

Drugs such as 'meow meow', 'Black Mamba' and 'Benzo Fury' were all legal when they were first produced, but have since been outlawed.

However, banning the substances has had no effect on the number of deaths they have caused, which increased from 29 in 2011 to 52 in 2012, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Among legal highs, deaths involving a substance called cathinone tripled from six in 2011 to 18 in 2012.
