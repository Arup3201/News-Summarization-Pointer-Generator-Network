Missing: Malcolm Levesconte was last seen by regulars at the Royal Oak pub last Sunday

Regulars at a village pub where the landlord has gone missing along with £30,000 of their savings money from a thrift fund have told how they now face a miserable Christmas.

Malcolm Levesconte, landlord at the Royal Oak pub in Shrewton, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, was at the centre of an international manhunt this week after allegedly making off the cash he held on behalf of his customers.

The 59-year-old is listed by officers as a missing person and is last known to have boarded a ferry bound for St Malo in France at Portsmouth Harbour last Sunday.

He was last seen at the village pub, which he ran since 2002, earlier the same day when he reportedly told several drinkers 'It's been nice knowing you' as he left.

Mr Levesconte had collected funds from villagers wishing to save for Christmas every Friday telling them that he would pay the money into a bank account.

Each investor would then be paid their share before Christmas - the money should have been paid out on Friday, but both Levesconte and the funds are missing.

It is thought that the money was never paid into the bank account.

Widow Natasha Dunford, 36, told the Sunday People that she can now no longer afford to buy her 11-year-old son Josh the iPad he wants for Christmas.

She added that her and her son, whose father Alan died from a heart condition aged 47 five years ago, will no longer be able to spend Christmas with family in Wales.

She said: 'It'll just be me and Josh this year, we might just have to get a pizza.'

Also among Levesconte's alleged victims are Geraldine and John Rose who have lost out on nearly £1,000.

The most any of the pub's regulars is thought to have had in the fund, which has been running for between 15 and 20 years, is £2,400.

As well as his customers, Mr Levesconte is also alleged to have duped his partner Jan Handsley and former friend Chris Bolter who helped him run the thrift fund.

Mr Bolter, 57, said that that it was Levesconte's distressed partner Jan who raised the alarm that Malcolm had gone missing.

Mr Levesconte, who regulars say seemed normal at the bar on the day he disappeared, is said to have left a note at the pub saying he was going to board the boat but that he wouldn't complete the journey.

Mr Bolter said: 'It's not nice to have to tell people their money is gone and they're not going to get it back.

'He's a coward so I don't think he'll ever come back here.'

An emergency meeting of the local parish council launched a fundraising appeal and more than £9,100 of the lost money has been recouped through events and donations.

One of the victims, Lee Acton, said he and his family had paid £2,400 into the savings club and had been saving £50 a week to pay for Christmas.

He said: 'I have two daughters, one of four and one nine. I don't want them to know all their Christmas money has gone and I'm trying to find ways of getting all their presents.

'I don't think they should know what's going on because I don't want to ruin their Christmas.

'I'm amazed how the whole village has come together to try and help out not only myself but everyone else in this thrift club.'

A note on the pub door said that the Royal Oak will be 'Closed until further notice' yesterday.

Police said that Mr Levesconte was due to return from St Malo the following day but officers do not believe he boarded the ship to return.

Detectives were working with their French counterparts to trace Mr Levesconte. French police say that it is possible he arrived in the country but may have since crossed the border into another country.

He was last seen at the village pub in Amesbury Road, Shrewton, Wiltshire last Sunday.

On the same day, he booked tickets for and later boarded a ferry at Portsmouth bound for St Malo in France, according to police.

A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: 'At this stage, officers are treating this as a criminal investigation but also as a missing person inquiry.'

Detective Sergeant Mike Standing from Salisbury CID said they would be contacting the 60 victims by letter outlining the action they need to take.

Concern: Police are treating the case as a criminal investigation, but also treating Mr Levesconte, left, as a missing person. The pub will remain 'Closed until further notice' according to a handwritten sign

'We
are making numerous inquiries to try to establish what has happened to 
this £29,000 Christmas thrift fund which has left so many people without
the cash they need for presents and food this year,' he said.

'We are becoming increasingly concerned for Mr Levesconte’s safety and continue to treat his disappearance as a missing person inquiry.

'We would strongly urge anyone who thinks that they have information about his whereabouts to come forward and speak to us.

'If you have heard from Mr Levesconte or had contact with him near to when he went missing, and think that you have information that would assist us, we would like to hear from you.'
