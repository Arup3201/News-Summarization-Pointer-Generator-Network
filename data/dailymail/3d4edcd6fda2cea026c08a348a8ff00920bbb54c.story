Police were called in to manage crowds and pacify irate commuters at one of Britain's busiest railway stations last night after thousands of travellers were left stranded during rush hour.

Travellers were photographed jumping over or crawling under ticket barriers in a desperate attempt to get on to the few trains passing through London Bridge. 

There was chaos because of signalling problems south of the station, while there were also issues after a person was hit by a train. 

Commuters said they feared someone could have been badly crushed on packed concourses.

Severe delays at London Bridge: Thousands of travellers were left stranded when services ground to a halt during rush hour, following signalling problems south of the station and by a person being hit by a train

Joe Kallas tweeted: ‘Avoid London Bridge like the plague. Southern Rail, you have outdone yourselves.’ Meanwhile Gabriella Griffith said: ‘London Bridge has reached peak chaos.’ 

British Transport Police officers were called to the station  to help manage the growing crowds, with a spokesman unable to say how long they were expected to be in attendance.

Services on Southern Rail were severely delayed last night, with many customers tweeting their outrage after being left unable to get home.

London Bridge - which is the capital's oldest major station and handles 54million passengers a year - has experienced overcrowding problems since redevelopment work began earlier this year. 

Crawling under barriers: Network Rail insisted it was hoping to return to normal service as soon as possible

Network Rail insisted it was hoping to return to normal service as soon as possible. A spokesman said: ‘There was an incident where a person jumped onto the tracks at Streatham. 

‘We turned off the electricity which powers the trains to prevent any further harm to the individual and British Transport Police were called to manage the incident and remove the person safely from the railway.

‘While the railway has been open since 5.27pm and this happened on a separate route to that serving London Bridge, it did cause a considerable amount of knock-on delays to other services, including those out of London Bridge tonight.

‘We're sorry this incident has caused the disruption it has and we're working as hard as we can to recover the service and get as many people where they need to be tonight.’

Nightmare: One angry traveller even tried to get her fellow passengers to sign a petition asking Southern Rail to improve their service

One angry traveller even tried to get her fellow passengers to sign a petition asking Southern Rail to improve their service.

Sachika Taniyama tweeted: ‘Can we all sign this? I pay £200 per month to this company Southern Rail and all it brings is misery to my day.’

She also tweeted a link to an e-petition demanding that Southern ‘be held accountable for its rising fares and diminishing customer service, which cause misery to thousands of passengers daily’.

A spokesman for Southern Rail UK said: ‘Unfortunately, a series of incidents including a person being struck by a train have affected evening peak services from London.

‘Delays of up to 60 minutes, cancellations and short notice alterations to services have been experienced by our passengers for which we apologise.

‘Our main focus is on getting everyone home and we are working hard on that at the moment.’

Apology: Network Rail said it was 'sorry this incident has caused the disruption it has and we're working as hard as we can to recover the service and get as many people where they need to be tonight'
