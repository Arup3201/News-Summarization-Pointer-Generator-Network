James Milner feels acclimatised to the weather in Miami, despite hurricane season sweeping through the city, and joked that it was just like Manchester.

England's training session in Florida was washed out on Monday and they were forced indoors to complete their work in the gym at Barry University.

That was despite temperatures reaching 27 degrees and 80 per cent humidity, the kind of conditions England will face in Manaus for their opening World Cup game against Italy.

But Milner said: ''The weather is similar to Manchester - pretty wet. No change.'

Hodgson was said to be ‘calm and relaxed’ about the situation, but it is nevertheless a disruption to his World Cup plans.

England play Ecuador on Wednesday at Sun Life Stadium before playing their final friendly fixture against Honduras on Saturday at the same venue, home to NFL team the Miami Dolphins.

England arrived in Miami on Sunday and are staying at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel during their seven-day stay before flying on to Brazil at the weekend.
