Son of terror suspect convicted: Imran Mostafa, the 20-year-old son of controversial Muslim cleric Abu Hamza, pictured, has been convicted for his part in an armed robbery of a jewellers in Norfolk

The son of controversial Muslim cleric Abu Hamza has been convicted after he stole £70,000 of gems in an armed smash and grab raid on jewellers.

Imran Mostafa, 20, was one of three men who raided jewellers in Kings Lynn, Norfolk armed with a firearm and a hammer as shop staff cowered behind counters.

The civil engineering student denied his part in the robbery on January 31 and possessing a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence but the jury at Norwich Crown Court convicted him of both charges.

The jury heard that three men burst 
into the shop and used a hammer to break display cabinets while another 
many stayed in a waiting van. 

The men wore hooded tops to disguise their faces.

Prosecutor
 Ian James said: ‘Members of staff cowered behind counters as the men 
burst in, one with a firearm and another with a hammer, which was used 
to break the display cabinets before leaving with what they could.

‘One of the robbers let off some sort of
 smoke bomb causing confusion and stock was taken as loads of glass 
fragments went everywhere because of the way the robbery was conducted.’

Mr James also said that Mostafa was Hamza’s son, after the Recorder of Norwich, Judge Peter Jacobs lifted a contempt of court order.

He said: ‘His (Mostafa) parentage is as we thought. His father is Abu Hamza.’

The judge said: ‘The gentleman with the hook.’

Mr James replied: ‘Yes’.

Hamza is considered a dangerous terror suspect who is currently appealing to European judges over his extradition from the UK to America after being accused of conspiring to take Western hostages in the Yemen, funding terrorism and running a terrorist training camp in Oregon between 1998 and 2000.

In the jewellery robbery, Mostafa and Ossama Hamed, 19 of Fulham, London, Ahmed Ahmed, 19, of Enfield and Jonathon Abdul, 17, also of Fulham, dumped the van nearby the shop before returning to London. They also stopped in Gayton to dump jewellery casings.

Mostafa told the jury that he was teaching Arabic and the Koran at a community centre in London at the time the robbery took place.

He said he was on a gap year from university and said: ‘I am not a thief. I am not an armed robber.’

Other sons jailed for different crime: Hamza's other sons Hamza Mustafa Kamel, Mohamed Kamel Mostafa and Mohssin Ghailan (left to right) were jailed in 2009 for their part in a £1million luxury car scam

Abdul, who was 16 at the time of the robbery, denied the offences but was also convicted by the jury.

He said he was subject to a bail curfew at the time and had to return to London by 10pm that day.

The judge lifted previous reporting restrictions on the youth, allowing the publication of his name of someone under 18 in ‘these exceptional circumstances’.

The judge asked for full pre-sentence reports to be prepared.

Hamza has seven children and in the past his relatives have been arrested for various offences.
