England goalkeeper Joe Hart has opened talks with Manchester City about a new four-year contract after receiving assurances that he is seen as the club's long-term No 1.

Hart, 27, has returned to top form after a shaky start to the season and is keen to extend his stay at The Etihad before his current deal runs out in 2016.

City's Director of Football Txiki Begiristain is currently trying to structure a deal that would mean a pay rise for the £80,000-a-week goalkeeper while allowing the club to stay within Financial Fair Play regulations.

Hart will view the final offer as evidence of whether City regard him as one of their main players, having already sorted out long-term deals with David Silva, Sergio Aguero, Samir Nasri and Vincent Kompany.

The 6ft 4in stopper has admitted feeling unhappy when left out by City manager Manuel Pellegrini with the manager saying he had two first-choice goalkeepers in Hart and £6million summer signing Willy Caballero.

But having won two Premier League titles and the FA Cup and become City's longest-serving player since the departure of Micah Richards, Hart would like to stay and challenge for more trophies.

Initial discussions with Begiristain have been amicable with Hart left feeling he is part of the club's long-term future, though he is still awaiting the precise financial terms of a deal that would keep him at the club until the summer of 2018.

Hart was dropped for two months last season after a high-profile error against Chelsea but reclaimed his place to lead City to their second title in three seasons.

He acknowledged his disappointment at Caballero facing Sheffield Wednesday and Hull City last month, declaring at a press conference with Pellegrini sat next to him: 'Of course I want to play every game. That’s my nature, my professionalism. I always want to play but I’m not the manager.

'I live by the decisions of our manager. I think he knows that I’d love to play but he has to make decisions.'

Hart will face Estonia on Sunday in England's latest Euro 2016 qualifier. He was cheekily voted man-of-the-match by England fans against San Marino on Thursday despite having virtually nothing to do.
