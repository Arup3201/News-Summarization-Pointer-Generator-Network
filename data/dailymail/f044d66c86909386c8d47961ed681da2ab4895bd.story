Police in Indiana have spent the past 12 years puzzling over a 19th-century tombstone that somehow ended up in a resident's backyard.

With the help of social media and an enterprising Good Samaritan, the Greenwood Police Department now has come one step closer to solving the mystery.

In June 2002, a Greenwood woman was digging in her garden when she stumbled upon a 144-year-old gravestone.

Collecting dust: The macabre item has been languishing in a police evidence locker for 12 years

The tomb marker was engraved with the name Charles A. Smith, a 20-month-old boy who passed away on August 6, 1870.

The bewildered homeowner called police, who seized the headstone and placed it in their evidence locker, where it has languished for more than a decade.

With no clues or tips to work off, investigators were completely stumped by the macabre find.

‘We’d have to assume it was probably a prankster or someone that maybe got scared and decided they had to get rid of it somehow, so they buried it. But we really don’t know,’ Detective Sgt Eric Klinkowski told the station Fox59.

Two weeks ago, police decided to harness the power of social media, sharing a photo of the gravestone on their Facebook page and asking online users for help.

The unusual post caught the attention of Greenwood resident Caryn Turrel, who launched her own online investigation into the mystery stone slab.

With the help of the genealogy site Ancestry.com, Turrel discovered that Charles A. Smith's gravestone came from Kosciusko County, Indiana, more than 170 miles south of Greenwood. 

‘It’s just made me feel good that ten minutes of my time was able to fix something,’ Turrel told the station WISH-TV.

The burial site marker is expected to be returned to its rightful place this weekend.

However, police say they may never know how it ended up in a Greenwood backyard more than two hours’ ride from the cemetery.
