A Venezuelan man has taken body modification to the extreme in a bid to make himself look like comic book super villain Red Skull.

Henry Damon, 37, had already had several subdermal implants on his forehead before having part of his nose removed in order to achieve the right Marvel madman look.

Despite the drastic surgery, Mr Damon, from Caracas, Venezuela, is getting ready to take it even further to fulfill his dream.

Real-life villain: Henry Damon, 37, from Caracas, Venezuela, has had his nose removed as part of his facial transformation into a real-life version of Marvel villain Red Skull

Mr Damon's goal is to look like Marvel character Red Skull, portrayed on screen by Hugo Weaving in 2011 film Captain America: The First Avenger

The married father, who now calls himself Red Skull, also tattooed his eyeballs black before adding red and back face tattoos to look like the comic book villain. 

Red Skull first appeared in 1947 as the Nazi agent arch-enemy of Marvel hero Captain America and most recently appeared in the 2011 film Captain America: The First Avenger, played by Hugo Weaving.

After meeting up with med-school dropout Emilio Gonzalez, who specialises in tattooing and extreme body surgery, Mr Damon 'knew that this was his opportunity,' a friend said.

'He has loved comic books since he was a kid and always dreamed of being Red Skull, but never got round to doing it,' friend Pablo Hernandez said.

Before the surgery, Mr Damon underwent several physical and psychological tests, according to his 'surgeon' Mr Gonzalez.

'Henry aka Red Skull is a physically and intellectually healthy person,' Mr Gonzalez said.

'He's an excellent son, husband and father, who has an extreme taste for body modification.

'Most of my customers know that body modification is the last step of body art, everyone knows very well what they want and as well as Henry, many of them are waiting for me for many years to make their dreams a reality.' 

Mr Gonzalez added that Mr Damon is not done with his transformation, and is about to take it even further. 

Mr Gonzalez said: 'Next will be silicone implants on the cheekbones, chin and cheeks.

'Then we will tattoo his entire face red and then he will be Red Skull.'  

In recovery: After he had his nose removed, Mr Damon had further subdermal implants done

Final steps: After his nose healed and his forehead bulked up, Mr Damon started adding red and black tattoos to his face to get the right Red Skull look
