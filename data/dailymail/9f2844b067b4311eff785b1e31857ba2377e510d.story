Two cars in U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's motorcade have been involved in a crash in India. 

State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the collision happened as Mr Kerry's motorcade was heading to the airport in Ahmedabad.

Mr Kerry's vehicle was one of those caught up in the crash, but there were no injuries. 

The crash resulted in some damage to both cars, one of which was substituted, and the motorcade continued its journey to the airport.

Mr Kerry was in Ahmedabad for a long-scheduled appearance at an international investment conference and to prepare for President Barack Obama's trip to India later this month.

In a statement, Psaki said: 'During the drive to the airport in Ahmedabad, India, two cars in the motorcade had a minor traffic accident resulting in some damage to both cars.

'Secretary Kerry was in the first of the two vehicles. He sustained no injuries nor did any staff or personnel. 

'One vehicle was switched out and the motorcade proceeded to the airport without further incident.'

Clarifying, Psaki told reporters on Kerry's plane that he did not get out of his car and that the vehicle switched out was the one behind him.

Earlier, John Kerry confirmed he would now travel to Paris after the U.S. government was shamed for not joining a rally yesterday for victims of the French terror attacks attended by 40 world leaders and a million people.

It came as a staggering 3.7million people gathered across France today to stage further defiant marches in a moving tribute to the 17 people killed in hostage sieges last week.

The Secretary of State said at a news conference that U.S. officials, including himself and President Barack Obama, had been 'deeply engaged' with French authorities almost immediately after the first attack occurred and had offered intelligence assistance.

As to criticism about the lack of a senior official at Sunday's March, Kerry said: 'I really think that this is sort of quibbling a little bit in the sense that our Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was there and marched, our ambassador was there and marched, many people from the embassy were there and marched.

'As everybody knows, I have been here in India for a prior planned event,' he added. 

'I would have personally very much wanted to have been there but couldn't do so because of the commitment that I had here and it is important to keep these kinds of commitments.'  

He said as soon as he heard about the march, he asked his team what the earliest time was that he could go. 

While in Paris, Kerry will be meeting with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and pay tribute to the victims of last week's attacks, which killed 17 people. 

Kerry is a fluent French speaker, has a well-known affinity for France and has visited Paris more than a dozen times since becoming secretary of state.

Kerry will arrive in Paris on Thursday after stops in Sofia, Bulgaria and Geneva, Switzerland.
