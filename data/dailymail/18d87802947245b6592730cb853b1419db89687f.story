A preacher in Florida who shares the same name as the man who shot an unarmed teenager dead last year says he is being plagued by abusive phone calls.

George Zimmermann, 78, who has two 'n's in his surname unlike the man who shot Trayvon Martin, says he has received death threats and angry calls since his namesake, who is 29, was acquitted of second-degree murder earlier this month.

Now the elderly preacher from Deland, Volusia County, has called police for help in dealing with the calls, in which he has been told to 'watch your back' and 'you're a dead man'.

Preacher George Zimmermann, 78, says he is plagued by abusive calls and death threats from people who think he is George Zimmerman (with one 'n'), who shot Trayvon Martin dead

Mr Zimmermann says in one call he was told: 'Hey [expletive] you're the one who killed Trayvon Martin, when your [expletive] get out, you're dead.

'Wherever you go, you're dead...You better get ready to dig a six-foot hole,' the Huffington Post reported.

The preacher says he is not frightened by the calls and understands that people just want to take their frustration out after a trial verdict that angered many in the U.S.

He told WESH.com that most of the calls involved swearing and name-calling and said: 'I know it's ridiculous but this is people.'

He added: 'The type of people that would do this, they're just venting their emotions, and being what I am, and who I am, OK, you vented, you've done it. I listened to you.'

The preacher says while he understands why people are calling him, the calls are so frequent they are becoming a nuisance.

He has now changed his telephone number and is hoping the issue will be solved.

Trayvon Martin was shot dead on February 26 last year by Neighborhood Watch rep George Zimmerman, 29, as he walked through a gated housing complex in Sanford, FL.

Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder in April last year and acquitted following a jury trial on July 13 this year.
