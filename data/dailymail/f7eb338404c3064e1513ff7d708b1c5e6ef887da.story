Amid the post-match excitement of Wednesday night’s stunning Champions League victory in Rome, Samir Nasri suggested Manchester City are now among the best teams in the world. In Moscow and even in Rome itself, there will be many who disagree.

Certainly this year’s Champions League has seen the very worst of Manuel Pellegrini’s team at times. When they have been bad, they have been horrid. In four games against CSKA Moscow and Roma, for example, they won once.

Big results can turn seasons, though, and, for perhaps the first time under Pellegrini, City now have a very big European result behind them.

The 2-0 victory in the Stadio Olimpico not only completed a remarkable back-from-the-brink story that began with Sergio Aguero’s two late goals against Bayern Munich in their penultimate group game, it will have given them a little of the self-belief that can carry teams an awful long way in knockout competitions.

‘I’ll be biased, of course, but for me we have one of the best teams in the world,’ said Nasri, scorer of City’s first goal on Wednesday. ‘We just have to show it now.

‘I think, when you go through, with all the difficulties we had, it’s a miracle. We had only two points after four games.

‘But we did it and we can go as far as possible. We just have to be lucky in the draw.’

As Nasri spoke, team-mate David Silva stood nearby and expressed his own wish that City avoid the big Spanish teams in the draw for the last 16 of the competition.

Pablo Zabaleta added a late second for Manchester City as they moved into the knockout stages  

‘I prefer anyone else,’ said Silva. ‘I don’t want any one of them. The later you play a Spanish team, the better, no?

‘They’re all so good that, if you get one, you may as well get one of the others. It would be a difficult draw. But every team that gets through now, they’re difficult.

‘No matter who we get we have to be 100 per cent and have to get a little luck too.’

Silva’s candour was interesting and it’s hard to disagree with the rationale. City, on the evidence of the season so far, would appear to be some way behind the likes of champions Real Madrid and Barcelona, who knocked them out last year.

Pellegrini’s team remain fundamentally hard to judge. As modest as they have been at times this season, they showed a resilience not always associated with them against Roma and we saw performances from central defender Eliaquim Mangala and midfielder Fernando to suggest they may finally be growing into life at their new club.

Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure were among the players missing for City against Roma

With injured players to come back at various stages over the coming weeks, there is much to suggest that City will get better. But can they realistically expect to compete with Europe’s best and overhaul Chelsea at the top of the Barclays Premier League?

‘I just think you want too much from us,’ said Nasri, peculiarly. ‘Like you said, if you qualify for the next stage of this, and you are just three points behind Chelsea, when a week ago everyone was comparing them to the Invincibles from Arsenal, everyone saying they were unbeatable and stuff like that, then it means we are not that bad.

‘The thing is last season we were smashing every team 6-1, 6-0, 5-0, but everyone has studied all the teams, it’s not the same any more.

‘And you have a couple of injured players and a couple of key players who are not at their best so, you know, we just show that as a team we can perform.’

‘I think it was really important to perform without three or four of our main players.

‘Any other team would struggle so it was important. We have made a lot of progress in the past few weeks.

‘It’s been three weeks where we have performed really well, like we did at this time last year. It’s maybe a coincidence that it was at the same period last year that we produced our best results.

‘But it was important to perform, it was important to go through, because of the ambition of the squad and the club. We did it as a team, that’s the most important thing.’

City now have six wins from six games. Performances recently against teams such as Southampton and Sunderland in the Premier League have been convincing and a visit to Leicester offers further opportunity to bolster new-found belief.

Certainly they will miss Aguero, while it will be interesting to see if Gary Neville’s suggestion that Yaya Toure may struggle to find a way back into the team is borne out. It would be surprising if it is.

What is perhaps more important is that City now have a statement European result behind them. Every team — every manager — needs one. From here, anything can happen.

Asked how good City can be, Nasri was circumspect. ‘I don’t know,’ he said. ‘When we are able to have all of these players available, we will see how good we are.’
