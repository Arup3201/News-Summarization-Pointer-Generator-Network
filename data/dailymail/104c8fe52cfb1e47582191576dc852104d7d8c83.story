With seven bedrooms, grand fireplaces and a walled garden, it inspired the beloved children's novel Tom's Midnight Garden.

Now, the magnificent Kings Mill House in Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire has gone on the market for a staggering £3.45million.

The 3.5-acre Georgian property, which was the childhood home of author Philippa Pearce, comprises a five-bedroom main house, a two-bedroom cottage and sprawling grounds.

Built in 1825, its main house features high ceilings, country-style decor and a heated swimming pool, as well as an enormous master bedroom.

Meanwhile, its adjoining cottage sits among trees in the beautiful landscape garden, which also features medieval fish ponds.

Mrs Pearce, who died at the age of 86 in 2006, spent her childhood years in the country home, before writing Tom's Midnight Garden in 1958.

The children's novel, which was awarded the Carnegie Medal the same year, tells the story of a boy called Tom who is staying in an upstairs flat of an old country house and is not allowed out to play.

But every night, when the clock strikes 13, he escapes into the property's garden. There, Tom plays with a girl called Hatty, who drastically begins to age every time he goes to play with her.

Eventually, it emerges that the girl is, in fact, an elderly and reclusive landlady who lives above Tom, called Mrs Bartholomew, and he has been visiting events that were real in her past.

In Mrs Pearce's novel, the country house, which backs on to the River Cam, appears just as it is in real life.

And it was not just the property itself that inspired the book - with Great Shelford becoming the fictional village Great Barley, the river being referred to as the Say and Cambridge appearing as Castleford.

Idyllic: And it was not just the property itself that inspired Mrs Pearce's novel - with Great Shelford becoming the fictional village Great Barley, the river being referred to as the Say and Cambridge appearing as Castleford. Mrs Pearce's daughter Sally Christie said her mother would have 'fallen over backwards' at the house's price tag

Despite moving out of the house as an adult, Mrs Pearce eventually returned to Great Shelford - and bought a property just across the road from her childhood home.

Mrs Pearce's daughter Sally Christie, who now lives in the property with her family, said she felt Kings Mill House was 'beautiful', but that her mother would have 'fallen over backwards' at the price tag.

'My mother had an idyllic childhood, and a deep love for the house and its garden,' she said. 'Tom’s Midnight Garden was partly inspired by the place and by her distress at the thought of what might happen to it when it was sold.'

James Barnett, the head of country sales Savills, Cambridge, said: 'It’s a special house and the level of interest we have had has been quite significant.

'Prestigious houses close to Cambridge are rare enough but it is always nice to find they have literary connections.

'The gardens are very beautiful and there’s a lot of formal box hedging and attractive planting as well as modern improvements which really sets the house off well.

'It would be inspiring to anybody wandering around.'

It is not known why the current owners are selling the property.
