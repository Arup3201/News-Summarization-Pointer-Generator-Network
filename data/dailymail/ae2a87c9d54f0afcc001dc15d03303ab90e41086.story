Barcelona's new coach Luis Enrique finished Wednesday’s friendly against Napoli with 10 youth-team players on the pitch and seems determined to give youth its chance. 

But who from Barca’s academy will really make the step up to the first team?

Martin Montoya (23)

He was the oldest outfield player on the pitch last night and finished the game with the captain’s armband. He knows this is a make or break season at Barcelona with Dani Alves looking out of a favour and Barca unlikely to bring in a new specialist right-back.

Alejandro Grimaldi (18)

Very highly thought of at Barcelona and the eventual successor to Jordi Alba. He offers the same attacking threat from deep although it might still be a while before he’s ahead of the Spain international.

Edgar Le (20)

Ticks at least two of the Barcelona defender boxes because he can also play at right-back and the comes out from the back with great confidence. Also defends well but there is no imminent step-up on the horizon.

Seung woo Lee (16)

After bettering Leo Messi’s youth team scoring statistics Lee put most of the top teams in Europe on alert with his finshing, his speed and his intelligence. Unfortunately for Barcelona, Fifa were also alerted to the way he was brought from Korea to Calalonia, and the game’s governing body say their rules on the relocation of young players parents were broken so he can only play in friendlies until he turns 18. He looks set to stay at Barcelona however and those who have watched his development since arriving in 2011 believe if he continues to progress it will be well worth the wait.

Frank Bagnack (19)

A graduate of Barcelona’s Cameroon academy set up by Samuel Eto’o, Bagnack is lightning quick but like Le not expected to step up to the first team despite Barcelona’s shortcomings in the centre of defence.

Sergi Samper (19)

Perhaps the pick of the bunch. Keeps possession well but not at the expense of moving the ball forward purposefully. Should make the step up at some point soon. Big things expected of a midfielder who Barcelona have tied to the club until 2017 and have no intention of letting go despite interest from the Premier League.

Sergi Roberto (22)

Stepped up to the first team squad last season but without really taking his chance and may not be far from the crossroads of a move away from Barcelona on loan to show he can take the next step. Another tidy midfielder but needs to show he can also drive a team forward. Pep Guardiola was a big fan and looked at taking him to Bayern last year.

Munir El Haddadi (18)

Plays wide left or through the middle and was the only youngster to start for Barca against Napoli – ahead of Gerard Deulofeu who Luis Enrique says still needs to improve defensively. He showed plenty of intelligent running and was played in twice for goalscoring chances but failed to take his chance both times. Impossible to step up with so much talent ahead of him.

Alen Halilovic (18)

Much is expected of the Croatia national team’s youngest ever debutant who will play for Barca’s B-team this season but with an eye to a fast-track to the first team. Can play wide in the front three but far more comfortable in midfield where his left-foot passing range can cut teams open.

Bright future: Croatian Alen Halilovic (right) is expected to become a star at the Nou Camp 

Adama Traore (18)

The jury is split on Adama. Is he the next big thing to come out of football club Barcelona or does he just look so good at B-team level because he is so much quicker and stronger than his peers? If his footballing brain develops to match his pace, power and skill he will soon make the step-up. A season on loan similar to Deulofeu's at Everton might help that process.

On the move: Winger Adama Traore could benefit from first-team football on loan at another club
