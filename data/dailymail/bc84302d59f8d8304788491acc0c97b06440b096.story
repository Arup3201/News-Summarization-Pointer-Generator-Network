Miss Bruck, 22, from Maybee has not been seen since the early hours of October 26 despite extensive searches on foot and by helicopter to locate her

Widespread searches have been conducted on foot through cornfields and remote properties and by helicopter but no trace of the 22-year-old has been found. 

Her sister, Kassandra Bruck, 24, told the Detroit Free Press that the family is encouraging people to share photos of Chelsea - across Michigan and beyond.

She told NBC: 'This is 100% uncharacteristic, it’s not anything she would do. She even told my mom, ''I'm not staying long. I'll be back in a couple of hours.'' This has just broken my parents.'

The party host Mike Williams, 30, told the paper he had been forced to close the party, intended for 500 people, after around 800 revelers turned up. He added that he hadn't seen Miss Bruck at the party at all. 

A GoFundMe campaign to help find Miss Bruck has raised close to $6,000.
