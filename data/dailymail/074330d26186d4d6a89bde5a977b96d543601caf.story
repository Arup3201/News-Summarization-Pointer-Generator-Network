Announcement: Former West Ham United midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger has announced he is gay

Thomas Hitzlsperger today became the first Premier League footballer to come out as gay after recently realising he 'preferred' men.

The 31-year-old German international midfielder, who ended his playing career in September due to persistent injuries, said he came out in a bid to break the taboo 
of homosexuality in sport.

In what as a landmark moment for football, he told Germany's Die Zeit newspaper that now was ‘a good time’ for him to reveal his sexuality.

Hitzlsperger said: ‘I'm coming out about my homosexuality because I want to move the discussion about homosexuality among professional sportspeople forwards.

The retired footballer said he has only realised ‘in the past few years’ that he would ‘prefer to live together with another man’, saying the issue is otherwise taboo inside the dressing room.

‘I've never been ashamed of the way I am,’ he added, although he conceded it has not always been easy to live with some of the comments dished out on the subject.

‘Just picture 20 men sat around a table together drinking - you've just got to let the majority be, just as long as the jokes are halfway funny and the talk about homosexuality doesn't get too insulting,’ he said. ‘In England, Germany or Italy, homosexuality is not taken seriously as an issue, at least not in the dressing room.’

The 31-year-old is the first high-profile German player to publicly reveal that he is homosexual.

Justin Fashanu was the first professional footballer in Britain to come out in 1990 before he took his own life eight years later, aged 37. But he never played in the Premier League, which began in 1992.

Hitzlsperger played 52 times for Germany between 2004 and 2010 and spent his club career at Aston Villa, VfB Stuttgart, Lazio, West Ham United, VfL Wolfsburg and Everton.

He used to live with fiancée Inga Totzauer in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, but split up with her in June 2007 only one month before they were due to wed.

Former England footballer Gary 
Lineker said on Twitter: 'Congratulations to Thomas Hitzlsperger on 
bravely being the first player to have played in the Premier League to 
"come out".'

Lineker later tweeted that he was looking forward to interviewing Hitzlsperger for the BBC One show Football Focus this week. 'A man, hopefully, paving the way for others to follow,' he added.

BT Sport 
football presenter Jake Humphrey added: 'In 2014 it shouldn't be an issue that a 
pro footballer is gay. Sadly it still is, therefore, huge credit to 
Thomas Hitzlsperger.'

And Queens Park Rangers midfielder Joey Barton said: 'Thomas Hitzlsperger has shown a lot of courage today. Sad times when people have to wait till they retire from their chosen profession.'

Former
 Leeds United and US winger Robbie Rogers announced he was gay last 
year, and  Hitzlsperger is the latest high-profile sports person to 
speak about their sexuality in public.

Tennis
 star Martina Navratilova came out publicly as gay in 1981 while John 
Amaechi was the first NBA (National Basketball Association) player in the US to openly admit to being gay in 2007.

Ex-Wales
 rugby union captain Gareth Thomas, plus England and Surrey wicketkeeper
 Steven Davies, have both also come out in the last five years.

Olympic
 boxing gold medallist Nicola Adams topped the Independent's annual 
'Pink List' poll of influential lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
people in November 2012.

And last month Tom Daley revealed he was in a relationship with a man, while two other Olympic divers have previously come out.

Australian
 Matthew Mitcham announced he was gay in 2008 shortly before he won a 
gold medal at the Beijing Olympics.

And four-time Olympic diving 
champion Greg Louganis revealed he was gay following his retirement in 
1995. The full interview with Hitzlsperger will be published in the Die Zeit newspaper on Thursday.

Chris Basiurski, chair of the Gay Football Supporters' Network, said: 'We really welcome this news.

‘It shows that we are moving one step 
closer to creating that atmosphere in football where players at all 
levels would be able to come out should they want to, safely and free 
from discrimination.

'In 2014 it shouldn't be an issue that a pro footballer is gay. Sadly it still is, therefore, huge credit to Thomas Hitzlsperger'

Jake Humphrey, BT Sport presenter

‘We hope that one day current players would feel able to come out and that eventually a player’s sexual orientation will not be a news story. But for now, we wish Thomas Hitzlsperger well.’

And a spokesman for campaign group 
Stonewall told BBC Sport today: 'It's fantastic that he has been brave 
enough to openly discuss his sexual orientation.

'Every
 sports star who is willing to speak out makes it just that little bit 
easier for gay players and fans, and we hope, a new generation of 
footballers will feel confident enough to be themselves.'

John Amaechi (basketball) - The American-born Briton was the first NBA player to openly admit to being gay in 2007. The 6ft 10in star used his autobiography, Man In The Middle, to make public his sexuality, and admitted afterwards the reaction from the public had been encouraging, saying: ‘I can't say there hasn't been any negative reaction at all, because there has. But I've been wildly overwhelmed by the positives.’
