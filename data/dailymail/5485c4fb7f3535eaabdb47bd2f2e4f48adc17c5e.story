A veteran of the war in Afghanistan who fought through concussions and shrapnel to the face in order to save a fellow soldier after an ambush by the Taliban became just the seventh living recipient of the nation's highest military honor on Tuesday.

President Barack Obama gave the Medal of Honor to Kyle White in a White House ceremony befitting the courageous deed the Seattle native performed that November day in 2007 when he was just 20 years old.

White fought for the lives of his comrades amidst rocket-propelled grenades, gunfire and a round of friendly mortar. He even continued to fight when he came to after an explosion knocked him unconscious 30 seconds into the battle.

Honored: Seattle native Kyle J. White became just the seventh living soldier to receive the military's highest honor when Barack Obama gave him the Medal of Honor at a White House ceremony on Tuesday

Best of the best: The former active duty Army Sergeant, smiles after being awarded by President Obama the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry, during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House, in Washington, DC on Tuesday

'We pay tribute to a soldier who embodies the courage of his generation': Obama lauded White as he became the seventh living recipient to be awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan

Good company: Former Army Spc. Kain Schilling, standing right, the soldier that former Army Sgt. Kyle J. White saved, and members of the second battalion, Chosen Company of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, stand at attention as they were recognized by President Barack Obama while in attendance at Tuesday's ceremony

Another honor: Former U.S. Army Specialist Kain Schilling, who was saved by White in the 2007 fight, has since made White his daughter's godfather

By the time the four-hour firefight was over, White had saved one comrade's life and helped secure the evacuation of other wounded Americans.

'We pay tribute to a soldier who embodies the courage of his generation,' Obama said.

With the medal, White, who was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome after the ambush, also draws attention to the recent scrutiny confronting the Veteran's Affairs health care system and allegations of lapses in care and delays in mental health treatment.

Brave: White was only 20 years old and not yet two years into his military service when the group was ambushed while pinned to a steep mountainside. He was knocked unconscious in the first seconds of the fight and came to only to continue helping his comrades

Though Obama did not mention the VA controversies specifically, he told White: 'You did your duty, and now it's time for America to do ours: after more than a decade of war, to welcome you home with the support and the benefits and opportunities that you've earned.'

Following the ceremony, White, 27, said the valor belonged to all the members of his platoon that day.

'Battles are won by spirit,' he said. 'Without the team, there can be no Medal of Honor. That's why I wear this medal for my team.'

An Army account of the attack says White, then a 20-year-old Army specialist, and his team of 14 U.S. troops, along with Afghan National Army soldiers, were ambushed Nov. 9, 2007, after attempting to hold a meeting with village elders in the village of Aranas in Nuristan province.

After regaining consciousness from the grenade hit, White found his platoon split by the ambush. Half the team had slid down the cliff for cover. He remained atop with three dead, dying and wounded comrades.

Obama described the drama to an East Room audience of service members, family and White House staff:

'Across Afghanistan, base commanders were glued to the radios, listening as American forces fought back an ambush in the rugged mountains. One battalion commander remembered that all of Afghanistan was listening as a soldier on the ground described what was happening.

'They knew him by his call sign, Charlie-1-6-Romeo. We know it was Kyle, who at the time was just 20 years old and only 21 months into his military service.'

Though suffering from concussions, White treated Schilling's injuries under the shadow of a lone tree and used one of the unit's radios to call for help. When a helicopter arrived after nightfall, White only allowed himself to be evacuated after the wounded were assisted.

A shocking video posted on Live Leaks shows footage taken of the brutal ambush by the Taliban.

Shocking: Video taken by the Taliban during the November 9, 2007 ambush features a narrator invoking the Qur'an as he describes why White and his fellow soldiers must die

Horrifying: The soldiers can even be seen slipping down the mountain in the video. At the time, some of the group made it out of the way of enemy fire while White and others remained pinned at the top of the mountain

A narrator invokes Allah as he describes the evil deeds of the soldiers in the footage and the 'proper reception' the men are about to receive as guests in the hostile region.

The footage rolls on as gun fire and the grenade launches begin and the soldiers slide helplessly down the mountainside to which they are pinned.

Left at the top with White were platoon 
leader 1st Lt. Matthew C. Ferrara, Spc. Kain Schilling, Marine Sgt. 
Phillip A. Bocks, who was imbedded with the group, and its interpreter. 
White set about trying to assess the condition of his fellow soldiers, 
running and crawling through gunfire only to find Ferrara dead and Bocks
 badly wounded. Though he tried to stop Bocks' bleeding, the Marine 
later died.

Schilling attended White's Medal of Honor ceremony.

White retired from the Army in 2011 as a sergeant. He graduated from the University of North Carolina-Charlotte with a finance degree, and he now works as an investment analyst at a bank in Charlotte.

'Kyle will tell you that the transition to civilian life and dealing with the post-traumatic stress hasn't always been easy,' Obama said. 'More than six years later, he can still see the images and hear the sounds of that battle. Every day, he wakes up thinking about his battle buddies.'

Later, White said he and Schilling wear identical bracelets.

'On it are the names of my six fallen brothers,' he said. 'They are my heroes.'

'The first thing that they need to do is reach out and get the help that they need': White himself suffers from post-traumatic stress and has recognized the need for those like him to connect and get help
