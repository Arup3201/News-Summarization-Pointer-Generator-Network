When Mike King was growing up in Louisville, Kentucky, his mother married a man who he describes as 'my DAD, the best thing that ever happened to me.'

At eight years old, Mike promised Roger King that he would buy him a '57 Chevy Bel-Air on his 57th birthday.

Roger King recently turned 57 - and Mike, now 31, was able to keep his promise, presenting his dad with a classic turquoise Chevy complete with bench seats and spotless interiors.

Disbelief: An emotional and teary Roger King hugs his son Mike King before approaching his dream car

A touching video of the moment Mike presented Roger with the coveted car was posted to YouTube, where it's been viewed almost two million times.

Roger King grew up poor in a family of seven children and had always dreamed of owning a '57 Chevy Bel-Air, never believing he'd ever have the opportunity.

He and Mike often spent time poring over car magazines and discussing the virtues of the classic car, which Roger 'knew he never would be able to own.'

'My dad has been everything to me, he is not my biological father but he IS my father,' wrote on a Reddit post about the video.

'When I was eight years old I promised him that on his 57th birthday I would buy him a 57 Bel-Air. I never forgot and was able to fulfill my promise.'

In the video taken by Mike King's sister, Roger King is distracted by a cornhole board he is trying to fix in his son's driveway, and doesn't notice Mike opening his garage door to reveal the vehicle in all its glory.

When his dad finally notices it, he lets out a small, 'No!' and hugs his son tight and sobs, overcome with emotion.

When they walk into the garage, Mike King hands over the car keys and his dad examines the car in disbelief. Finally, he leans over and kisses its roof before climbing inside.

'This is spotless, man!' he says.

In a Reddit post, Mike said that he's been holding onto the car for two years since he traveled to New Hampshire to buy it and has been hiding it from his dad in his garage.

To afford the car, Mike says he was working at a factory and pulled 60-hour weeks for months to be able to afford the car.

He says he hasn't done much to fix up the car, but that his dad is now retired and can spend all his time working on it.
