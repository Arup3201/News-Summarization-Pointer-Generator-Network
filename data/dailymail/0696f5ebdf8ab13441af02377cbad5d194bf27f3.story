Alan Pardew was rewarded with a straightforward win at Gillingham after selecting as strong line-up against the League One side – and saw 18-year-old Rolando Aarons impress on his full debut.

Without impressing, Newcastle were rarely troubled by Peter Taylor’s side and they at least registered their first goal of the season even if none of their own players scored it. 

They were the beneficiaries of an own goal courtesy of Gillingham defender John Egan, after Gabriel Obertan broke down the right and delivered a dangerously-placed cross which caused the Irishman to miscue and put through his own net on 25 minutes.

It was a curiously un-spirited display by Gillingham who tried to out-wit Newcastle rather than out-fight them, with their back three formation. 

But their wing backs were constantly pinned back by the pace of Obertan and Aarons, which ruined their hopes of having extra men in midfield. 

Aarons, the Jamaican-born 18-year-old who grew up in London, looked especially sharp on his full debut having come on as a substitute on the opening day of the season against Manchester City.

He was consistently inventive until he went off injured on the hour and went close on 36 minutes when Stephen Bywater saved. 

Newcastle were dominant without being threatening having started with seven of the players who featured against Villa in the Premier League on Saturday. However, two of those, Emmanuel Riviere and Siem De Jong, looked anonymous as they struggled to link up with their team-mates, with most of Newcastle’s threats coming from the wing.

Nevertheless, Newcastle were quite clearly a class above their opponents throughout and kept possession excellently. 

Gillingham’s attacking input was extremely limited. Cody McDonald did manage to get away on 12 minutes and run into space but Fabricio Coloccini shepherded him effectively away and won the ball with a crunching challenge which prompted an ambitious penalty appeal from Gillingham, which referee Oliver Langford declined. 

And wing back Matt Fish almost beat Tim Krul with a curling shot from the edge of the box on 36 minutes but otherwise it was quite first half for Newcastle’s defenders.

Newcastle started the second half in much the same fashion an almost went further ahead in 53 minutes when Massadio Heidara hit a superb 35-yard strike that bounced off the cross bars. 

Colocinni then forced a save from Bywater on 62 minutes from 20 yards. 

But Gillingham seemed curiously uninspired, standing off Newcastle and allowing their Premier League colleagues all the time and space they required.

Only with the introduction of Luke Norris on 65 minutes did Gillingham finally register a shot on goal, the 21-year-old cutting across goal, beating Colocinni and then forcing Krul into a sharp save with his shot from just inside the box on 70 minutes. 

There was barely even a late rally and Newcastle were able to manage out the game comfortably without any late scares.
