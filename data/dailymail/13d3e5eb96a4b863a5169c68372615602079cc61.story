Chrissy Teigen, who stunned in a form-fitting white Emilio Pucci gown  at last night's Grammys, has revealed her secret to losing weight and getting her body red carpet ready - in just five days.

After indulging in a variety of her favorite fattening foods from Waffle House, Taco Bell and Jack in the Box during Super Bowl weekend, the 29-year-old model admitted that she had 'gained a lot of weight' a week before walking the red carpet with her husband John Legend, 36.

Chrissy, who is also attending this year's Oscars, revealed to Elle that she asked her stylist to give her just five days to 'cleanse it out' before her dress fittings.

'For some reason, I either go hard or I don't at all,' she explained. 'I'm pretty lucky. I can pack it on in two days and I can lose it all in two days.'

While Chrissy may be able to credit her rapid weight-loss to genetics, the Sports Illustrated model noted that she has been working out with her trainer and attending Model Fit pop-up classes in Los Angeles.

As for sustenance, Chrissy said that she has been drinking juices and eating salads – but revealed that she has been adding her own personal touches to make the healthy meals more satisfying.

'I love taking the salads I get from those crazy organic delivery places and putting them on a plate and then roasting my own lamb to put on top,' she explained. 'I balance it well. And listen, if I'm not eating Waffle House and Taco Bell and Jack in the Box, anything will make me lose weight.'

A-list friends: Kim Kardashian took to Instagram to share a series of snapshots of her and the couple at the awards show

Chrissy, who is known for eating anything and everything, said she never feels guilty because she loves indulging in fast food but explained that it is important for her to balance her meals. 

When grocery shopping, she said that she always goes for meat and vegetables first. 

'If I did a diet I would do Paleo, except they have no cheese, which is very upsetting. I'm going to start my own Chrissy diet that's like Paleo plus cheese. Plus late Saturday night drive-through.'

Chrissy has had a busy red-carpet season so far.

Last month, she and John attended the 2015 Golden Globes, where he and rapper Common won an award for their original song Glory from the film Selma.

John, who earned a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Solo Performance for his song All Of Me, was joined by Common on stage for a moving performance of their song.

During the show, the couple hung out with their close friend Kim Kardashian and posed for a series of snapshots, which the reality star shared on Instagram.

On January 31, Kim and her husband Kanye West joined Chrissy and John for an impromptu double date and some comfort food at Waffle House following the DirecTV Super Saturday Night concert event.

And while it has been a busy couple of months for Chrissy and John, they're not done yet.

The couple will be hitting the red carpet on February 22 for the 2015 Academy Awards, where John and Common's Glory is up for Best Original Song.
