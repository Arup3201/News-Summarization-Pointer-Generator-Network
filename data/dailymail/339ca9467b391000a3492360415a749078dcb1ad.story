A district nurse who wrote explicit fantasy stories ‘based on her job’ including one about having sex with a terminally ill patient faces being struck off.

Kathleen Pugh, 53, worked with seriously ill housebound patients across Lancashire when she published ‘Angel with Black Wings’, which describes a nurse seducing a patient before killing him with a lethal injection in his own home.

It was part of a collection of stories called Aristocracy Or Not And Other Stories, which the 53-year-old promoted at her clinic and even sold to patients and staff.

Kathleen Pugh is facing a misconduct hearing after publishing the novels in 2010

A misconduct hearing today found her guilty of writing the book, advertising it at work and distributing it to patients and colleagues.

The panel is now considering if Pugh is fit to work as a nurse - but she has already told the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard she wants nothing more to do with the profession.

She quit her job at Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust in Lancashire in June last year when bosses launched a disciplinary hearing after reading the book.

The nurse worked for Oldham Community Health Services under the trust, giving care to housebound patients including some who were seriously or terminally unwell.

One patient who bought the book from Pugh said she was ‘disgusted’ by the story, which mirrored her work as a nurse.

Pugh told a local newspaper she had based some of her story on her work, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard.

‘There are points of the story which detail actions taken by a district nurse, having sex with a patient and also killing them’, said Paul Pretty, for the NMC.

‘The nature of those parts of the passages directly correlates to the role Ms Pugh was employed in.’

Her collection of short stories was published in 2010 by Author House

Bosses at Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, where Pugh works, believe her fitness to work is impaired after reading the book

Today panel chairman Fiona Freedland said after finding Pugh guilty: ‘Given the subject matter of the story, which relates to sexual activities between a district nurse and a dying patient, the panel takes a serious view of her actions in distributing it to a member of staff and a patient.

‘This was further compounded by Mrs Pugh’s actions in advertising the book containing the story on posters within the workplace.

‘She abused her privileged position for her own ends.’

The book, published by Author House in 2010, includes the tale of Angela Diablo, a 'shapely' health visitor treating a dying patient for pain relief who fantasizes about having sex with her.

‘I was concerned by the content of the book, which appeared to be based on her work as a district nurse’, said team leader Susan Kearns, Pugh’s line manager.

‘There was a story about a dying patient in a dream-like fantasy world.

Kathleen Pugh denies all the charges against her but did not appear at the misconduct hearing

‘The nurse has sex with him before administering a lethal injection.’

Mrs
Kearns said medication mentioned in the story is used by nurses like 
Pugh, and she was responsible for patients in the community in similar 
circumstances to the character in the book.

‘One patient who bought the book told me she didn’t like it and was disgusted by it’, Mrs Kearns said.

‘She told me she had bought the book from Kathleen.

‘I
was quite shocked really, that she even knew about it, and I didn’t 
realise that Kathleen was discussing the book with patients.’

Pugh
is accused of putting up posters in the clinic at Royal Oldham Hospital
advertising her book, handing copies to patients and staff, and selling
the book to at least one patient, the hearing was told.

Mrs Kearns said Pugh put up a poster in the clinic’s reception area which stayed up for around a month, and initially had a work contact number for anyone looking to buy a copy.

‘It wasn’t appropriate that people should be ringing up about something personal to the district nursing office’, she said.

‘She was obviously trying to sell it, but I felt it would make the district nurses look like they were promoting the book.’ 

Pugh refused to take part in the NMC hearing, but admitted putting up posters at work featuring a picture of her in her nurse’s uniform advertising the book.

The book, which is still available online, is described as a ‘selection of stories that will spark the curiosity of many an avid reader’.

Pugh says the tales show a ‘world of romance, passion, empathy, and compassion’ from the 19th century to present day.

Pugh denies putting up posters at work and contests that her fitness to practice as a nurse is impaired.

The hearing continues. 

An extract from one of the short stories 'An Angel with Black Wings' describes a dying patient's fantasies with a nurse who is treating him for pain relief.

In the story patient Andrew describes dreams in which 'shapely' Angela Diablo visits him in the night for sex before injecting him with drugs to hurry his death - despite his protests.

It reads:

'"Oh Andrew. Tonight you will be mine. I will ease your pain.
With my kiss and love making! I will give you comfort in your last hour."

'He didn’t see the syringe appear from behind her as she
jabbed it into him causing him pain and then nothing. The clear liquid injected into his shoulder.

'Her tears now flowing...

'"I am sorry Andrew, it had to be!" holding the limp Andrew is her arms.'
