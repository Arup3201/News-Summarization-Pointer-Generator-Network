Rev-olutionary: The V8 Car Themed Hotel in Stuttgart, Germany, which features beds made out of real vehicles

Going the extra mile: One of the themed rooms which has been designed to look like a car scrap yard

A car lovers dream: The V8 Car Themed Hotel in Stuttgart, Germany, also features classic cars throughout the building

The themed rooms, which vary in price from 135 euros to 466 euros a night - are equipped with unique props and memorabilia and are furnished with genuine car parts from Morris Minors to Mercedes.

Soom rooms even have vintage cars grafted
into footboard of the beds so guests can sleep in their favourite 
vehicle without getting a bad back.

The V8 Hotel building was formally the terminal for the Boblingen Airport, opened in 1915.

Boblingen was used as docking station for flights of the Graf Zeppelin in the late 1920s, and it was home to a squadron of ME-109 fighter aircraft during the Second World War. 

Going all out: Even the reception and restaurant boast a wide variety of cars

On the road to sleep: This Morris Minor has been transformed into a bed - complete with a run over pedestrian

Wide appeal: Guests vary from car enthusiasts, families and businessmen

Being near to the industrial hub of Stuttgart meant that Boblingen Airport was an obvious target for Allied bombers and was left in ruins by the end of the war. 

But the building was eventually rebuilt and reopened as the V8 hotel opened in 2009.

The V8 Hotel occupies only half of the terminal building, the other half is shared by the Meilenwerk, an auto museum that offers car enthusiast a rare look at a fascinating collection of classic, vintage and collector cars, and everything else related automobiles.

Hotel employee Heike Petzold said: 'Everybody wants to stay here when they come to the Meilenwerk.

The hotel is situated next to the Meilenwerk auto museum in case guests want to learn more about the cars they are sleeping in

Something for everyone: Not all the rooms are car themed

'It's really amazing because even people who live in the area come here to stay for a night in the themed rooms.

'It attracts everyone of all ages, from children to old age pensioners and of course businessmen during the week and families too.

'All kinds of people come here, so it's not just for car enthusiasts, but of course there are those that are interested in car history and the automobile industry's connections to the region too.

'We've even had a few celebrity guests, but I can't say who they are as I'm not allowed.'

To get back in touch with nature: Another themed room is designed like a park complete with hammock, lamppost and a deer

In the fast lane: But even the V8 hotel's non-themed rooms still feature cars

Long history: The V8 Hotel is situated on the former Boblingen Airport which was used as docking station for flights of the Graf Zeppelin in the late 1920s
