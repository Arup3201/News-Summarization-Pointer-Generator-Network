President Barack Obama warned Republicans in Congress on Friday that he was prepared to act without them to plug financial holes in America's immigration infrastructure, which is increasingly burdened by a flood of children and teens slipping into the U.S. from the south.

'While they're on vacation, I'm going to have to make some tough choices to meet the challenge, with or without Congress,' he said during a 45-minute-long press conference at the White House.

Obama's opening statements were entirely about domestic issues, but journalists in the room asked mostly about foreign policy, teeing up softballs about Russia's antagonism in Ukraine and the Israel-Hams conflict.

'I thought you guys were going to ask me how I was going to spend my birthday,' Obama said near the end of his appearance in the press briefing room.

Ready to go it alone: Obama warned he will continue his pattern of making laws without Congress if they don't act on his immigration funding request

The president took questions but reporters were mostly interested in foreign policy, not his immigration squabbles with the GOP

Reporters' actual interest in immigration seemed limited to why Republicans don't trust the White House to act in good faith, given the president's habit of issuing high-profile executive orders without their consent.

In turn, the president was most focused on needling his GOP opposition about their lack of enthusiasm for passing immigration legislation, saying he expects to 'act on my own to solve the problem' while they are away from Washington for the next five weeks.

Citing '80 per cent' of border issues on which he claimed 'there is agreement' between House Republican leaders and his administration, he skewered his opposition for its intramural squabbling – most in evidence Thursday night as warring GOP factions held a funding bill in limbo.

That measure would have provided Obama with $659 million, a fraction of the $3.7 billion he has asked for. 

Competing versions passed around the Republican caucus focused alternatively on funding to strengthen the border and an outright ban on any White House efforts to expand the Deferred Action 
for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, a 2012 mini-amnesty program for people brought to the U.S. illegally as children.

The result, said Obama is 'not a disagreement between me and
 the House Republicans; it's a disagreement between the House 
Republicans and the House Republicans.'

Conservatives in the House Republican 
caucus are most worried about the possibility that Obama could 
unilaterally make a larger move than just rearranging Border Patrol 
budgets: They fret about an executive expansion of DACA, and have pushed for any border bill to include an outright prohibition on the program's growth.

Rep. John Fleming, a Louisiana Republican, summed up the situation on Capitol Hill by telling The Hill that the conflict is 'insurmountable.'

'We are a completely wide spectrum' of opinion, he said. 'We've got some members of the House Republicans, and maybe even in the Senate, that agree with Democrats much more on this issue than Republicans.'

'But on top of that, you've got a president who does what he wants – who ignores the law, enforces only parts that he wants – and we can't trust that he'll do anything.'

On Thursday, House GOP leaders withdrew their own bill from consideration after it became clear that not enough Republicans would support it in a vote.

Almost immediately, White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer presaged Obama's likely move to make a unilateral policy change.

'By pulling their own bill,' he tweeted, 'the House GOP once again proves why the President must act on his own to solve problems.'

The GOP was set to give up but House Speaker John Boehner and newly minted Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy brought boos and catcalls by announcing that they would delay the August recess for another day of wrangling.

The most recent rewrite added $35 million for an increased National Guard presence on the U.S.-Mexico border, but it's unclear if that will be enough to cement a Republican coalition large enough to bring the measure to a vote – and then to an inevitable rejection in the Senate.

The game is a familiar one in Washington, with the two house of Congress controlled by opposing parties and trying their best to not be the chamber holding the legislative ball when the music stops before a month-long intermission.

Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said Friday that 'when it comes to the humanitarian crisis on our southern border, President Obama has been completely AWOL – in fact, he has made matter[s] worse by flip-flopping on the 2008 law that fueled the crisis.'

'Senate Democrats have left town without acting on his request for a border supplemental [budget request]. Right now, House Republicans are the only ones still working to address this crisis.'

Man of the hour: On his first day in a new leadership role. House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy had to tell a groaning House chamber that the August recess was delayed

No drama: Obama seemed unflappable as he cautioned Republicans against defying his immigration funding demands

Obama has suggested he would veto any bill that denied his administration the funding he wants – most of which would grow programs that process and house the tens of thousands of unaccompanied children pouring across the border.

Less than 3 per cent of his funding proposal would beef up border security.

But he insisted Friday that a cash-strapped federal government would soon lack the means to respond to the current problem without Republicans' say-so.

'We've got to take action,' he said, referring to his domestic policy team at the White House.

'I'm going 
to have to act alone because we don't have the resources. We've already 
been clear. We don't have the money. ... We're going to have to 
reallocate some resources.'

Instead of writing him a blank check, Obama complained, the Republican Party's right wing has been steering the discussion toward solutions that are destined to meet his veto pen.

'House Republicans as we speak are trying to pass the most extreme and unworkable version of a bill that they already know is going nowhere, that can't pass the Senate,' the president said Friday.

'They're not even trying to to solve the problem,' he said. 'This is a message bill ... just so they can check a box before leaving town tomorrow.'

Each side of the ideological aisle has accused the other of posturing for political gain as fundraising kicks into high gear for November's congressional midterm elections.

DELUGE: A flood of new illegal immigrants, mostly children and teens, has swept across the southwest U.S. border in the two years since Obama announced a mini-amnesty for those who arrived unlawfully as children before 2007

In the Democrat-controlled Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid failed Thursday to advance a smaller $2.7 billion version of Obama's supplemental funding request, effectively killing it until September.

The measure was killed on a 50-44 procedural vote, fully 10 votes shy of what was needed to stop debate and vote on the bill's merits. Several moderate Democrats, including some facing tough re-election fights, voted 'no.'

Obama only briefly mentioned his usually foremost 'comprehensive immigration reform' refrain, claiming that his preferred approach – a complete overhaul of American immigration policy – 'might have 
forestalled some of the problems we're seeing now in the Rio Grande 
valley with these undocumented children.'

He has argued in the past that a rewrite of immigration law would give him the power to stop pursuing illegal immigrants who came as children – so-called DREAMers – and redirect those resources to more pressing problems at the border.

But in teeing up Democrats' disgust with slow-moving Republicans, he set the stage for an August recess full of recriminations about a 'do-nothing' Republican House.

'If in fact House Republicans are concerned about me acting independently of Congress ... then the easiest way to solve it is – pass some legislation. Get things done.'
