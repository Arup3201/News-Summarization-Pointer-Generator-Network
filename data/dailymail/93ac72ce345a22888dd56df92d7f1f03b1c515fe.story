A 20-year-old girl broke down in tears after discovering she had been in the same road accident which killed her older sister, a witness told a court today.

Rosie-Ann Stone is accused of causing the death of her sister Jennie Stone, 28, by careless driving after they were both in a queue behind a slow-moving lorry on the A165 in East Yorkshire.

Lorry driver Steven Wragg told Hull Crown Court today that he said to Rosie-Ann as he climbed out of his lorry: ‘That was a big one’ - and she shouted: ‘That was my sister’, before starting to cry.

Trial: Rosie-Ann Stone (left) is accused of causing the death of her sister Jennie Stone (right), 28, by careless driving after they were both in a queue behind a slow-moving lorry on the A165 in East Yorkshire

Mr Wragg, who was driving the HGV which the two women were trying to overtake on the road between Hull and Bridlington, said he initially thought Jennie was ‘driving like a bat out of hell.’

Prosecutors claim Rosie-Ann pulled out of the queue in her Vauxhall Astra to overtake the truck - but did not see that Jennie, who was further back, had also pulled out to overtake in her Peugeot 206.

Mr Wragg told the court: ‘I looked in my mirror and saw something flying through the air. I must have seen some sort of collision with plastic flying. I was not sure what it was.

‘I saw the blue Peugeot come in front on me at an awkward angle as if it was not going to make it. I knew the driver didn’t look right - and when it touched the grass it seemed to lose it altogether.

‘It was more or less back straight and
 went sideways into the tree. It careered across the front of me and 
seemed to lose control when it hit the grass more. It all happened so 
quickly.

‘It hit the tree 
very hard. There was an orange flash and a bit of smoke. I saw a girl running down the road. I said “That was a big one”. She 
shouted: “That was my sister”.’

Patrick Palmer, defending, said to Mr 
Wragg: ‘You remember the lady (Rosie-Ann) being very upset. She was 
effectively being hysterical. When you saw her she was not running to 
the blue car.

In court: Rosie-Ann Stone (centre), who was on her way home at the time of the crash, denies the charge

‘She had been to the blue car and was 
running back to you. You knew that a blue and a grey car had been 
involved in an accident.’

Mr
 Wragg said: ‘The lady (Rosie-Ann) was in such a state, other people led
 her way.’ Mr Palmer added: ‘She was someone who was beyond 
self-control?’ Mr Wragg replied: ‘Definitely.’

In
 his statement given to the police at the time of the accident on 
February 22, Mr Wragg said: ‘I saw a blue car pass me like a bat out of 
hell and hit a tree.’

Also dead: The women were sisters of Private Gregg Stone, a soldier killed in Afghanistan in June 2012

Asked
 about his statement by Mr Palmer, Mr Wragg replied: ‘I might have said 
that in the heat of the moment. It was not going over fast. When you are
 doing 40mph, everything seems quick.’

Michael
 Evans, a delivery driver who was driving a red Ford transit van and 
witnessed the crash, told the jury: ‘The blue car (driven by Jennie) got
 out and was passing me. I thought she should not have done that. I said
 “Jesus”.

'She should not be doing that. There was a car coming in the opposite direction. My fear was she was not going to make it back in time to avoid the on-coming traffic.

'I was doing about 40mph, so maybe it was doing 50mph. I thought she had gone too far to the right and clipped the barrier. She lost control of the car and skidded across the road.

'I didn’t see another car bye or near the other car when it hit the barrier. It hit a tree.’

Meanwhile,
 Humberside Police senior accident investigator John Rusted told the 
court that Rosie-Ann failed to look in her rear-view mirror to check 
before she pulled out.

He 
said: ‘However long Jennie Stone was in that offside lane, Rosie-Ann 
Stone would have had a clear view of Jennie Stone behind her.

‘In
 my view it is not safe to pull out if you don't have a clear view, 
because you cannot be sure you are not pulling out in to the path of 
another vehicle.’

Mr Rusted 
told the jury he had visited the scene of the accident and that scuffing
 on the two women’s cars matched, showing the older sister was 
travelling faster at the point of impact.

He
 said: ‘In my view the most likely scenario is Jennie Stone had moved 
out of to commence and overtake behind the transit van, behind the 
(Nissan) Serena.

‘The 
minimum distance between the two sisters is 27 metres when Jennie Stone 
pulls out. We don't know the exact gaps.’ Mr Rusted added that the 
likely speed of Jennie’s car was 50 to 60mph.

Sisters: Prosecutors say Rosie-Ann (left) pulled out of the queue in her Vauxhall Astra to overtake the truck - but did not see that Jennie (right), who was further back, had also pulled out to overtake in her Peugeot 206

He said Jennie would have been overtaking for several seconds. Mr Rusted added that even if she hit Rosie-Ann at 70mph as one witness estimated, the time to see her was ‘a couple of seconds’.

Mark Ibbotson, a paramedic who went to the collision, told the jury: ‘I was asked to treat a lady in the back of a Nissan. She was very upset.

‘She said: "Other cars were overtaking a HGV in front, and my sister was behind me. I pulled out to overtake too - into the path of my sister behind me”.’

'There was an orange flash and a bit of smoke. I saw a girl running down the road. I said "That was a big one". She shouted: "That was my sister"'

Steven Wragg, witness

Under cross-examination by Mr Palmer, 
Mr Ibbotson said: ‘She was extremely upset and hysterical. I believe she
 is asthmatic. I treated her for an asthma attack. I think she was in a 
hysterical state.

‘She 
was crying. From my examination she had the typical asthmatic wheeze. 
She wanted her inhaler. I provided oxygen and a drug through a mask on 
the face.’

Asked by Mr 
Palmer whether it struck him that Rosie-Ann was thinking calmly, Mr 
Ibbotson replied: ‘I don't think you could think in that manner after 
what had happened.’

Rosie-Ann, of Bridlington, who had been on her way home, denies causing death by careless driving. She told police she knew her sister was travelling on the A165 at the same time.

Jennie had recently moved to Skipsea from Bridlington and Rosie-Ann was helping her there until the return to Bridlington in separate cars.

Rosie-Ann and Jennie - whose parents Angie and Robert, both 56, have been in attendance at the trial - were sisters of Private Gregg Stone, a soldier killed in Afghanistan in June 2012.

The trial continues.
