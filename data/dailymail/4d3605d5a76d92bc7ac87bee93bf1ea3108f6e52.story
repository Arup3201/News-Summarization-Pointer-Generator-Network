Accused: Monsignor Kevin Wallin was allegedly suspended by the Church for having sex in his rectory. He has also been charged by police with distributing crystal meth in a cross-country ring

Friends and colleagues are now saying that they knew something was wrong with the alleged drug-dealing priest when he started to lose a lot of weight andÂ  began acting strangely.

Roman Catholic priest Kevin Wallin has plead not guilty to the federal drug charges, but now colleagues are saying that there were a number of warning signs to show something was awry.

They first investigated into rumors that Mr Wallin was behaving in inappropriate sexual activities in the Church rectory, and their first concern was whether or not it involved children.

When they determined that the homosexual trysts involved only consenting adults, they viewed the incident as a sin, and while it broke the moral code of Catholic priests, it did not break and

'There's a difference between sin and crime. We don't out people for their sins,' Brian Wallace, spokesman for the Diocese of Bridgeport, said to the Connecticut Post.

At that point in June 2011, they asked Wallin to resign- which he did- only to find new clues that the trouble extended further than they thought.

Wallin, nicknamed Monsignor Meth, is the former pastor of St. Augustine Parish in Bridgeport publicly said that he was resigning because of health and personal issues, but then he was formally suspended from public ministry last May by the Diocese of Bridgeport.

Federal prosecutors say Wallin sold more than $300,000-worth of methamphetamines out of his apartment in Waterbury from August to December and some of the transactions involved an undercover officer.

Trusted: Msgr Wallin served as the pastor at St. Augustine's in Bridgeport for nine years before taking a sabbatical in 2011 for health and personal reasons

Four other people have been charged in the alleged drug-selling operation that authorities say involved shipments of methamphetamine from California to Connecticut.

Cause for resignation: Wallin was found to be having sex in the Church rectory

Church officials also found a bag with 'sex paraphernalia' in his room, according to the CT Post.

Wallin, 61, is alleged to have bought an 'adult entertainment store' which investigators believe helped him launder thousands of dollars in weekly profits, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.

Rectory staff are believed to have notified the local diocese after the priest allegedly 'dressed as a woman and engaged in 'sex acts.'

Church officials said they were not aware that the priest was selling drugs when he was pastor of St. Augustine's Cathedral or in St. Peter Parish, according to the Chronicle.

He is believed to have continued to receive his stipend - salary - from the Church, until he was arrested on the drugs charges on January 3 this year.

Monsignor Wallin left his post as head of St. Augustine's after nine years and was granted a 'sabbatical' by church authorities.

'During
his sabbatical, the Diocese became concerned about his well-being and 
have continued to reach out to him,' the Diocese wrote in a statement.

'To date, he has not spoken directly with diocesan officials.

Ring: The priest and four others were arrested for allegedly conspiring to distribute crystal meth

'News of [his] arrest comes with a sense of shock and concern on the part of the Diocese and the many people of Fairfield County who have known him as a gifted, accomplished and compassionate priest.'

Monsignor Wallin faces up to 20 years behind bars and a $2million fine if convicted.
