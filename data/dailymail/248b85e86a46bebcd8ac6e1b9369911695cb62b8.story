An amateur photographer took these amazing shots of the clear night sky on a camera attached to telescopes from his back garden.

The area known as the heart and soul nebula can be clearly seen in one photo glowing red in the dark sky, lit up by the surrounding stars. In other photos, the orion and scorpion nebula - invisible to the naked eye - can also be seen amongst the stars

Greg Parker, 59, from Brockenhurst, Hampshire, installed two £3,000 observatories in his garden and attached cameras to the telescopes inside them.

The cameras are mounted on special trackers which trace the movement of stars across the sky.

Awe-inspiring: These pictures of the heart and soul nebula are made even more impressive by the fact an amateur astronomer took them from his back garden

High technology: Mr Parker installed two £3,000 observatories in his garden in order to indulge in his hobby

Sitting in the control room in his house, Mr Parker, a professor in photonics at the University of Southampton, remotely operates the four cameras on four different computer screens.

Sadly, Mr Parker may not be able to take these extraordinary photos for much longer. A streetlight which lights up the garden currently uses sodium yellow lamp which doesn’t affect his ability to take photos of the sky.

However, Hampshire County Council plan on changing the bulbs in the area with white LED bulbs - and their stronger light at night means he cannot use his observatories.

In his observatory, Greg has been working on a new technique for producing very wide-field deep-sky images.  Left is a view centred on the Cocoon nebula in Cygnus and the objects on the right are in the Perseus constellation

Ingenious: This is the Canon DSLR that takes the wide field images. An electric motor and drive belt allow Greg to manually focus the lens.

He said: 'If they go ahead with their plans to carry out the change I will have to move house. It’s really bad. It’s cheaper and can be turned down later at night but the telescopes won’t work in all the light.'

He took the pictures at 10-15 minute 
intervals over four hours. He’s able to clearly construct the outlines 
of the famous nebula in the sky and stitches the 16-20 
images together using astronomical software - allowing him to create the
 crystal clear photos of the sky at night.

Mr Parker said: 'On the back of the telescope there is a camera which captures special exposures.

'It sits on a mount and accurately tracks the moving stars while taking a series of photos.

'An electric motor and drive belt allow me to carefully and manually focus the lens via a USB to my main house computer.

'The mount moves the same way as the stars across the sky and takes sharp images at intervals to my choosing.'

He only took up stargazing in 2002 when he brought his first telescope.

Two years later, he got his first observatory set up in his garden courtesy of Pulsar Domes, a company in Cambridge selling astronomical accessories.

The second one was set up two years ago and he’s been taking photos of the night sky ever since.

Mr Parker added: 'The observatories are different because they contain different sets of telescopes.

'One has a reflecting telescope and the other a refracting one.

'I’ve always been interested in astronomy but I only got my first telescope in 2002, so I’ve been doing it for 11 years now.'

Mike Clements with his homemade 70-inch telescope

Despite being 93 million miles away, amateur astronomer Jose Manteca manages to capture stunning shots of the sun from his back garden.

Mr Manteca, who works as a sales representative, installed a small observatory on the terrace of his house in Barcelona.

Ever since he has used a humble DSLR camera to capture breathtaking shots - including solar prominences, sunspots and even a plane crossing the face of the sun.

Mike Clements has taken a lifelong passion and turned it into a record-setting astronomical achievement.

The long-haul trucker from West Jordan, Utah, has single-handedly built a 70-inch telescope — the largest one on record to be crafted by an amateur astronomer, enabling users to see constellations previously visible only through the £1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.

Clements bought the 900-pound mirror — which was originally destined to go into space as part of a spy satellite until the edge of it was chipped during its manufacture — after it was auctioned off.

An amateur astronomer has become the first person to capture a massive lightning strike 'into space' above the British Isles.

The atmospheric phenomena, known as sprites, had never been recorded in the UK before an amateur astronomer in East Yorkshire managed to take the photographic first.

Richard Kacerek, 33, spotted the sprite - caused by an upward lightning discharge five miles east of Hull - has sparked excitement in the scientific community with his image.
