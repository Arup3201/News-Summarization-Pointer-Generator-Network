The beloved mascot of Louisiana Tech University has been found dead of apparent heatstroke after a caretaker left the animal out in sweltering temperatures Sunday evening.

At first, the caretaker covered up the incident and said that Tech XX had run away, so the university mounted a desperate search for the English bulldog, who at just four years old, had endeared himself to legions of fans.

They even offered thousands of dollars in reward money for his safe return.

But early Wednesday, the director of the clinic that cared for him notified the world that Tech XX wasn't missing, he had passed away and the employee that covered it up had been fired.

Gone: The beloved mascot of Louisiana Tech University has been found dead of apparent heatstroke after a caretaker coldly left the animal out in sweltering temperatures Sunday evening

Missing: At first, the caretaker covered up the incident and said that Tech XX had run away, so the university mounted a desperate search for Tech XX, who at just four years old, had endeared himself to legions of fans

'Tech XX was a member of our immediate family and a daily part of our lives for the past four years,' Patrick Sexton, said in a statement.

As a Louisiana Tech University alumni and veterinarian, he cared for Tech XX at his clinic located four miles from campus.

'We are devastated over the circumstances of his passing, and there will be a large void in our hearts for some time to come,' he said.

He blamed the bulldog's death on the negligence of an employee who left the dog outside too long on Sunday evening.

Left Behind: When the dog was reported missing, dozens of Louisiana Tech University students, alumni and administrators combed over the area to look for him

Goodbye: The animal clinic is planning a memorial service for next week

'That employee unfortunately chose to handle it the wrong way and attempted to cover it up,' he said.

'The employee is no longer employed by Sexton Animal Health Center.'

When
the dog was reported missing, dozens of Louisiana Tech University 
students, alumni and administrators combed over the area to look for 
him.

At the time, they believed he had disappeared after a bathroom break and offered a $1,000 reward. After days of searching, they upped the reward to $2,000.

The animal clinic is planning a memorial service for next week.

'Tech XX was a cherished member of the Louisiana Tech family and, together, we will all grieve his passing,' the university said in a statement.

Innocent: Some alumni are calling for animal cruelty charges to be brought against the employee

Animal Clinic: Patrick Sexton, the veterinarian who cared for him, said Tech XX was like a member of his family

But grief is not good enough for some animal activists that say the English bulldog should not have died in vain.

'It is preventable. So, let's prevent it from ever happening again,' animal activist Pam Miller said to KNOE.

She demanded a complete investigation of the animal's death, adding that bulldogs will drool and pant when they overheat. Other alumni are calling for animal cruelty charges to be brought against the employee.

His predecessor, Tech XIX, was retired in 2007 because of health concerns after suffering heatstroke at a football season opener.
