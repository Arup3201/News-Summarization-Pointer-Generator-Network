Andrew Charles Pride, of Austell, Georgia, was found guilty on Wednesday of first degree child cruelty after whipping a toddler's genitals

A man who whipped a toddler's genitals so hard during potty training that the child bled, has been jailed for five years.

Andrew Charles Pride, of Austell, Georgia, was found guilty on Wednesday of first degree child cruelty.

He could have expected a maximum jail term of 20 years.

A Cobb County Jury heard that the man repeatedly beat the 22-month-old boy for 'resisting potty training'.

Prosecutors claimed the beating, which took place in August 2012, was caused bleeding and welt marks.

It was not revealed what relationship Pride had with the child, WSBTV.com reports

Chuck Boring, assistant Cobb County district attorney, said during the trial that beating had not been an accident and that it was malicious.

He added: 'And it was all because of potty training.

'Mr Pride struck a 22-month-old baby in the groin multiple times because he wouldn’t pee in the potty. This man’s actions are the definition of malice', the South Cobb Patch reports.

The court earlier heard that Pride had  allegedly encouraged an older child to say that they had beaten the toddler. 

In addition to the five-year prison term,  Pride must serve 15 years on probation.

He must also have no unsupervised contact with minors, according to court officials.
