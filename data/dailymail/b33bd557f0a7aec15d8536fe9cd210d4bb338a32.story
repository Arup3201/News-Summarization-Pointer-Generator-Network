Jailed: Former traffic warden Robert Ives issued bogus parking tickets to former colleagues

A corrupt traffic warden who issued nine bogus tickets against a former colleague during a ‘campaign of bullying’ has today (Fri) been jailed for six months.

Robert Ives, 59, dished out the dodgy parking notices to Kevin Phillips while based at Tooting police station in south London.

Ives also forged Mr Phillips’ signature on another ticket handed to an innocent member of the public, pensioner Shamim Gilani.

He was caught out after being linked to the tickets by his handwriting, Southwark Crown Court heard.

On one occasion, Mr Phillips, with whom Ives had an ‘unpleasant relationship’, was given a ticket when he was parked miles away in a completely different part of south London.

In a victim impact statement, Mr Phillips told how he suffered from high blood pressure and that his head had been left ‘spinning’ from the stress of disputing the tickets.

Mrs Gilani, 73, said she paid the £65 fine ‘with a tear in her eye’ as she and her husband were on a tight budget. She has since been reimbursed.

Ives, a Jack the Ripper enthusiast, who had been employed for the past 45 years, issued the parking notices in November 2011 - the same month he was made redundant. He has yet to find another job.

Mr Phillips had left four months earlier to work as a PCSO.

Ives, a father-of-one, insisted he had been ‘set up’.

But a jury of four women and eight men took just 24 minutes to unanimously convict him of misconduct in a judicial or public office, after a trial at the court last month.

Sentencing, Recorder Edward Cole told him: ‘Your misconduct appears to have been an unpleasant way of bullying Mr Phillips.

‘Why you picked on Mrs Gilani is not clear.

‘In the case of Mr Phillips, your misconduct amounted to a campaign of bullying.

‘Your conduct in each case was a 
malicious abuse of power and a breach of trust put in you to administer 
the system of parking regulation fairly and accurately.

‘Your conduct was in some ways similar those who pervert the course of justice.

‘Like all such offences, this investigation involved a waste of public resources.

‘Your behaviour involved a gross breach of trust and was persistent.

‘Public trust and confidence in those in public office is likely to be eroded by this sort of misconduct.’

Sentence: Ives was jailed for six months after a jury at Southwark Crown Court convicted him of misconduct in a judicial or public office Southwark Crown Court heard 

Ives buried his head in his hands during the hearing but was stony faced as he was led out of the dock.

Prosecutor Piers von Berg had earlier told the jury that Ives ‘wilfully or deliberately misconducted himself to such a degree to amount to abuse of the public trust in his office and he did so without reasonable excuse or justification.’

A handwriting expert who examined them concluded that there was a ‘strong possibility’ that they were penned by Ives and ‘certainly not by the other wardens’ at the unit, Mr von Berg added.

After getting wise to Ives’ handiwork, Mr
Phillips alerted his supervisor, prompting an investigation during 
which it was noted that Citroen had been spelt incorrectly as ‘Citreon’ 
on several of the bogus tickets.

‘Mr Phillips was asked if anyone bore a grudge against him or ill will,’ Mr von Berg added.

‘He said he had a poor relationship with Robert Ives when they worked together and police decided to question the defendant.’

Ives claimed he had not been working on the days the tickets were issued and suggested the handwriting expert could be mistaken.

David Parvin, defending Ives said he continues to maintain his innocence but has acknowledged that Mr Phillips and Mrs Gilani had endured ‘a lot of stress’.

‘Mr Ives believes he and Mr Phillips shared some friendship, they had some common interests and were both fans of Neil Diamond.

‘Their relationship can be described as up and down and this was really a practical joke that went horribly wrong.

‘As time went on it got more serious and Mr Ives felt he was unable to admit it.’

Ives, who has raised money for children’s charities, is a keen member of the Whitechapel Society, dedicated to keeping the east end alive.

Mr Parvin added: ‘His hobby is learning about Jack the Ripper and he has quite a collection of books.’

Ives, of Tooting, denied the charge against him.
