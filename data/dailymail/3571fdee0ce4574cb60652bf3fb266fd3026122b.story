Looking slim and tanned, daytime TV presenter Jeremy Kyle and his former-model wife made a rare red carpet appearance at the NTAs last night.

Jeremy, 49, posed with a protective arm around Carla, 40, who was radiant in a halter necked, backless silver and black sequined tunic dress, which, thanks to sheer panels, also showed off her long toned legs.

After 13 years together, during which time Jeremy battled testicular cancer, the couple - who have three children -  looked stronger than ever.

Jeremy looked trim and tanned on the red carpet at last night's NTAs with Carla, his wife of 12 years

The couple met in 1999 when Carla after splitting with the total stranger she married for a radio competition

Yet the unusual circumstances behind their  marriage sound like an episode from Jeremy's self-titled show.

In 1999, Carla Germaine - then a 23-year-old model - entered a competition run by the BRMB radio station in Birmingham where Jeremy was working, to marry a total stranger.

Called Two Strangers And A Wedding, she was selected to tie the knot with Greg Cordell, a groom chosen by the station, but three months later the marriage was over and she began dating Jeremy.

Jeremy later told The Scotsman newspaper: 'I have always said I completely and utterly disagreed with the competition and I was one of only two DJs who would have nothing to do with it.

'I met her three months later and she was like a rabbit in the headlights. She would tell you in her Brummie lingo that it was Monday, it was January, she had been dumped and was hung over, and her mate said, "Why don't we go for it?"'

They wed in 2002, have been happily married ever since and have three children Alice, 12, Ava, nine, and Henry, six, together.

Proudly family-orientated,  Jeremy told the Independent that his wife and family were 'the point' of his life, saying: 'My life in six words ... Carla, Hatty, Alice, Ava, Henry Kyle.'

When Jeremy was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2012, Carla was by his side, supporting him through the operation and subsequent chemotherapy.  

Kyle spoke openly about the value of her unwavering support, crediting his wife  with helping him through the treatment. 

He told The Sun at the time: 'It's been a horrific time - a very sobering experience - but now I just feel lucky to be alive.

'I feel lucky that I'm here for family and can see my kids grow up.

Despite the unusual circumstances of their meeting, Jeremy and Carla have been married for 13 years

'To be honest, I thought, "That's it, I'm dead". The phone call I made to Carla was one of the most difficult of my life.'

Carla is Jeremy's second wife. His first marriage to Kirsty Rowley ended in 1990 after a year together and the pair have a 24-year-old daughter Harriet.

Tonight, an episode of The Kyle Files airs on ITV tonight in which Jeremy, while filming a documentary about Spanish party resort Magaluf, is attacked with pepper spray.

In the show, Jeremy is walking down a busy street when his eyes start to sting and his throat burns.

A Romananian doorman, Leon, 40, later admitted he had sprayed the presenter because he felt the programme was showing Magaluf in a bad light.
