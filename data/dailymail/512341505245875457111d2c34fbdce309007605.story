Sir Henry Cecil received a standing ovation at The Juddmonte International yesterday

As the record-breaking racehorse Frankel galloped to the finish line, the crowd roared in delight - but many were simply cheering its legendary trainer who is battling cancer.

The unbeaten colt put on a brilliant display in the Juddmonte International Stakes at York - and all under the emotional eye of trainer Sir Hery Cecil.

Trainer Sir Henry was given a standing ovation himself after he returned following chemotherapy to watch Frankel achieve its winning record to 13.

He said he was determined to see the horse stretch to victory after missing its last race.

Ridden by Tom Queally, the 1-10 favourite passed the finish line seven lengths clear, receiving three cheers.

Wearing a sombre black hat, the great trainer's voice has been reduced to a whisper due to illness picked up as a side-effect of his cancer treatment, and he spoke only briefly.

'That was great, wasn't it?' he said.

'It's fantastic. It's great for Yorkshire, they are very supportive of racing and they deserve to see him.'

Asked how it made him feel, the trainer said: 'Twenty years better.'

Sir Henry was knighted in 2011 for services to horse racing and is widely regarded as one of the greatest trainers to have ever graced the Turf.

Trainer Sir Henry, who missed Frankel's last win at the Sussex States at Glorious Goodwood on August 1, has stated the Champion Stakes at Ascot would be his preferred route for Frankel to finish his career.

But the prize horse won with such ease 
over an extended mile and a quarter that he is just 1-4 to end on a 
winning note in France at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

Frankel's long-standing owner, Prince 
Khalid Abdullah, was also retaining the race he has sponsored for over 
20 years, and was aked as to whether he would be tempted by the Arc.

'I don't think so,' he said. 'I will talk to Henry about it but we'll see. I will do whatever Henry thinks

'I didn't think a mile and a quarter was a problem, but more than that I don't think so.'

The owner's racing manager, Teddy Grimthorpe, said: 'For Henry and the team to bring Frankel in such great shape to York, in front of a brilliant crowd who appreciated him, is absolutely fantastic.

'Then for the horse to perform like he did, it's a dream, isn't it?'

Considering the Arc, Mr Grimthorpe said: 'He's not in there. Henry didn't want him in the race and he'd have to supplemented.

'There
will be a discussion and we'll have to see. The plan was always Ascot 
but we'll have to see how he comes out of the race.'

Sir Henry has been Champion Trainer 10 times
and, as of June 2012, has trained 25 domestic Classic winners, 
comprising four winners of the Epsom Derby, eight winners of the Epsom 
Oaks, six winners of the 1,000 Guineas, three of the 2,000 Guineas and 
four winners of the St. Leger Stakes.

His success in the Epsom Oaks and the 1,000 Guineas has made him particularly renowned for his success with fillies.

He is the Master trainer at Royal Ascot, where he has saddled more than 70 winners.
