A 22 metre billboard showing a dead horse plastered above a major Melbourne freeway has been branded 'highly inappropriate and distasteful' by a racing boss.

Ahead of Melbourne's Spring Racing Carnival, the highlight of the racing year in Australia, the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses published their graphic campaign on the CityLink road near Footscray Road, west Melbourne, asking race-goers 'is the party really worth it?'.

The group are campaigning to 'improve the lives of racehorses' but Racing Victoria Chief Executive Bernard Saundry has blasted the sign.

'To put a dead animal, be it a horse, a dog or a cat, on a billboard is highly inappropriate and distasteful,' Mr Saundry said in a statement published on Racing Victoria's website.

'The billboard is offensive both to the 70,000 participants within the Victorian thoroughbred racing industry who love and care for their animals and indeed to the wider community who are travelling past this distasteful image.'

The Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses also published the image of the dead horse on their Facebook page.

'The racing industry has rejected our proposal to retire racehorses humanely,' they claimed.

They said the industry 'has allowed jumps racing to continue when it said the sport would end, allows under-developed horses to race and thinks it's OK to beat a horse an unlimited number of times towards the end of a race'.

One Twitter user also complained about the billboard and highlighted the way it's one of the first things people arriving in Melbourne would see

Another Twitter user pointed out that the next billboard on the road advertises the Melbourne Cup

However, Mr Saundry refuted any claims of animal cruelty.

'The health and wellbeing of our equine athletes is at the heart of our industry and central to the thinking of participants and administrators alike.

'The level of care afforded the industry’s equine athletes is practically unmatched by any other domesticated animal. Trainers, owners and breeders afford outstanding care to their horses.

'Indeed, over $300 million is spent annually in Victoria alone by owners on the training, care and welfare of the state's racehorse population,' he said.

Mr Saundry explained that trainers and breeders have their own vets to ensure the welfare of their horses is maintained, alongside the 60 vets contracted by Racing Victoria on racedays.

He added that the average fatality rate in Victorian thoroughbred racing is the lowest in world racing.

In 2009, officials put up a screen as they put down Geeorb after the horse was injured in a fall in  the Dominant Hiskens Steeplechase  at Moonee Valley Racecourse on July 25 in Melbourne

Last year the animal welfare and racing community was saddened when stewards at the 2013 Melbourne Cup confirmed race horse Verema – a 4-year-old mare - was put down after pulling up early in the race suffering a fracture to its right foreleg.

The horse was owned by His Highness Aga Khan of Jordan, one of the richest men in the world, and was the first time Aga Khan had taken part in Cup.

‘The sad reality with horses is they can't survive long enough on three legs for the leg to heal,’ Richard Freedman told Triple M's Rush Hour.
