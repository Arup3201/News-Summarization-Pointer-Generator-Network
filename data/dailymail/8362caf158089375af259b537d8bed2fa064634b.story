George Zimmerman has made a video with his new legal team where he says that he’s  trying to be a good person and he thinks he can help others after what he has gone through.

Zimmerman said he was trying to figure out who he is and he was doing the interview to 'show America who I truly am.'

In the video made Friday in Orlando, Zimmerman highlights his participation in a program in which he was a mentor to an African-American boy, and he also describes his efforts to raise awareness about a local case in which a black homeless man was beaten by the son of a white police lieutenant.

Speaking out: George Zimmerman released a taped interview with his lawyers as he tries to move on with his life in the wake of his acquittal in the murder of Trayvon Martin

Zimmerman said some day he would like to be able to go to law school and become a civil rights or defense attorney.

'On a grand scale, I would like to make enough of an impact on the judicial system so that what happens to me never happens to anybody,' Zimmerman said.

During the more than 20-minute interview, Zimmerman, dressed in a gray blazer and blue dress shirt, looks directly at the camera as he sits in an office chair.

When asked by an off-camera attorney what his daily life is like, Zimmerman said he worries constantly about his safety.

'The only thing consistent is having to always look over my shoulder and be concerned about others around me,' he said.

Zimmerman said he's trying to be a faithful family man but realizes that everything he does, good or bad, is heavily scrutinized.

Mentor: Zimmerman shared a muzzed photo of himself with the African American teenage boy that he mentored before the Trayvon Martin shooting

Occasion: As a sixth grade graduation present, Zimmerman took the boy he was mentoring to meet NBA star Dwight Howard

He told a story of how before the Martin killing, he fought for justice in a beating case where a black homeless man named Sherman Ware who was attacked by a young white man.

Zimmerman told how he raised awareness for the case and complained to the Sanford Police Department. His work was rewarded by the friendship of a priest who worked in the jail when Zimmerman turned himself in for Trayvon Martin's death.

'It felt good to know that everything comes around in life and even though you think some things are never going to be seen,' he said.

He went on to tell how he and his soon-to-be ex wife Shellie decided to enroll as mentors in a state-run program and they were partnered with a pair of African American siblings.

The Zimmermans took the children to the park and a local science center. He said that as a reward for passing sixth grade, George took the boy he was mentoring to meet NBA star Dwight Howard, and he included two photos of the occasion in the video.

He said that he has stayed in touch with the boy and his family, and is well known by the children in the neighborhood because he would regularly play basketball with them.

Some supporters: Zimmerman said that he is no longer able to go out in public like he once was but he did attend a gun show in Orlando over the weekend

'A lot of kids ask me if I could be their mentor still and that really strikes a chord with me,' he said.

Activities like basketball are no longer in the cards for Zimmerman, he said, as he has lived in a degree of fear ever since the acquittal last summer.

'The only consistent (thing) is always having to look over my shoulder. Always concerned for others around me. I miss out on a lot of the things I would normally enjoy doing,' he said.

'I can't go outside and play basketball. I can go to the grocery store if I wear a hat and sunglasses but even then I'm recognized.

'It's difficult, and its something that I didn't ask for but it's been placed on me so I have to try my best to adapt to it.

'I do realize there is no expiration date on the bounty on my head.

'I hope for the best, I truly do, and I try to work towards that goal but I also keep in the back of my mind that it may not get better, it could even get worse.'

The end of the murder trial wasn't the end of Zimmerman's legal troubles, however, as he had separate confrontations with his now-estranged wife, Shellie, and a former girlfriend, Samantha Scheibe. Neither Shellie Zimmerman nor Scheibe pursued charges against Zimmerman and the investigations ended without an arrest.

One of Zimmerman's divorce attorneys, Howard Iken, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the divorce process involves 'moving on and having a new life,' and that the video's release helps Zimmerman by allowing him to control his message.

'The publicity surrounding him is unfair and misinformed, especially the allegations he is a racist or bigot,' Iken said.
