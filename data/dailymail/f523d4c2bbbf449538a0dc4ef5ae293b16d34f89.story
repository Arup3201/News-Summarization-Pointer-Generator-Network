A teacher who tweeted she 'couldn’t be a****' at work has been slammed by rapper Professor Green.

The star told Clare Kelly, who teaches at St Thomas of Aquin’s High School, Edinburgh, teachers like her were 'one reason schools fail people'.

Ms Kelly, a drama and guidance teacher, had tweeted 'Born for better things... #work #cantbea****#whensthenextholiday.'

The tweet came to the attention of Professor Green, who became an unlikely champion for standards in education when he told his own followers: 'I’m about to give you an example of why schools fail people'.

Professor Green, seen here at the Radio 1 Hackney Weekend, told Clare Kelly, who teaches at a school in Edinburgh, teachers like her were 'one reason schools fail people'

Ms Kelly, a drama and guidance teacher, had tweeted 'Born for better things... #work #cantbea**** #whensthenextholiday'

He then re-tweeted her original tweet about being born for better things to his 1,836,387 followers.

Education chiefs in Edinburgh have taken 'appropriate action' against Ms Kelly, who reported herself to the headteacher as soon as the furore erupted.

Teachers are regularly warned about the perils of posting on social media and advised that careless remarks could land them in disciplinary trouble.

Professor Green seems to have become aware of Ms Kelly’s 'couldn’t be arsed' comment after she entered into discussion with him about the motivation of teachers.

Professor Green, who turned down a place at private school to follow his friends to a comprehensive, had commented online that 'there’s so much more to life' than exam results.

He then added: 'people like @clare-k-paisley teaching children is one reason schools fail people.'

Ms Kelly later took her tweets offline, but the rapper posted a picture of them to prove what she had said.

The teacher was met with a swarm of criticism online, including from former pupils.

But others rallied behind the teacher.

Edinburgh College acting and theatre performance lecturer John Naples-Campbell said her tweets were taken out of context.

He said: 'Clare was one of my own mentors and I have never seen anyone as passionate about theatre and drama education as she is.

Professor Green, is a hot property on the British urban music scene

'People are attacking her without knowing her.

'People forget that teachers are not products - they are human beings and they have feelings.'

Teaching watchdogs the General Teaching Council for Scotland warned social media carried risks for staff.

A spokesman said: 'Teachers can be vulnerable to unintended misuses of electronic communication.

'Email, testing and social media encourage casual dialogue - and very innocent actions can easily be misconstrued or manipulated.'

Council bosses said Ms Kelly had apologised and the matter had been resolved.

A spokesman said: 'The teacher realised she had made an error of judgement and went to see the head teacher immediately to apologise.

He added: 'We expect all out staff to display the highest levels of professional conduct at all times and appropriate action has been taken.'

London-born Professor Green, a 29-year-old whose real name is Stephen Paul Manderson, has released two albums and is considered one of the UK’s hottest urban music stars.

Professor Green was offered a place at the prestigious boys’ private school, St Paul’s, in north London.

But he instead followed his friends to a comprehensive in Tottenham, and drifted between two secondary schools before dropping out entirely.
