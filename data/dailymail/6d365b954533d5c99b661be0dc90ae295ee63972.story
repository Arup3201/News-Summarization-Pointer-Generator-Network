All those who have been wondering what effect the legalization of same-marriage marriage has had on Alabama now have their answer, and all thanks to self-proclaimed 'redneck news reporter' Jeremy Todd Addaway.

On Monday, Addaway posted a hilarious video on his Facebook page shot on his property near Red Hill, Alabama, in which he tries – and fails - to find evidence that gay marriage is destroying Blount County.

The video, which clocks in at under 2 minutes, begins with Mr Addaway dressed in a camouflage sweatshirt filing a report from the field on the state of his county in the aftermath of a federal court ruling allowing same-sex couples to get marriage licenses.

Not your average 'redneck': Self-proclaimed 'redneck news reporter' Jeremy Todd Addaway has made a funny video in which he tries – and fails - to find evidence that gay marriage is destroying Blount County, Alabama

No same-sex couples here! As a way to prove that nothing has changed in his home state in the aftermath of the court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, Addaway showed viewers a pile of branches (left) and his shed (right), where he said there were no homosexuals to be found

‘I read on the news today some information that homosexuals will be getting married in the State of Alabama today, and I wanted to give you a live report from Blount County,’ the intrepid correspondent says into the camera.

Addaway's cell phone camera then pans over to a heap of tree branches lying on the ground in his yard.

'This pile of brush is still here, and there are no homosexuals laying on top of it, doing homosexual things,' Addaway deadpans.

He then walks over to a cluttered outbuilding, peers inside and says: 'none in the shed either, but we've got to check into this further.'

After checking on his 'pile of junk' to make sure it has not been taken over by homosexuals, Addaway concludes that the residents of Blount County are safe.

Hunter and gatherer: Despite his penchant for camo clothing and his passion for hunting, Addaway has described himself as a liberal guy 

'We're not gonna be subjected to any kind of plagues of homosexuals falling from the sky,' he says.

But Addaway cautions his audience that he did see a couple of squirrels that looked 'kinda suspect.'

'So we should look into that further ‘cause it may be spreading into the squirrel population,’ he quips.

As of Friday evening, Addaway’s satirical video has been viewed more than 766,000 times and shared 13,225 times on Facebook.

In a follow-up interview with local blogger Josh Phillips, Addaway explained that as a 'liberal type of guy,' he decided to make the video after witnessing a lot of 'backward things' in his home state.

‘Our county is dry and people around here are living in the past,’ he said in the interview. ‘My goal with this video is to show people that the sky is not falling because gay marriage is now legal.

‘No one is going to wake up gay, I woke up this morning straight as ever. Everyone is getting too wound up about it.’

After initial panic sparked by the legalization of same-sex marriage, most counties in Alabama sided with federal courts rather than their own chief justice, a Republican who once called homosexuality an inherent evil.

US District Judge Callie Granade issued a strongly worded order Thursday saying that a judge could no longer deny marriage licenses to gays and lesbians, reiterating her ruling striking down the state's ban on same-sex marriage.

Progress: Officials in 16 Alabama counties began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples February 13, a day after a federal judge ordered a local official to issue the licenses in accordance with an earlier ruling

'These numbers represent a seismic shift in favor of equality and justice. Resistance to happy, loving and committed same-sex couples getting married is quickly crumbling throughout the state,' said Fred Sainz, a top spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, which has been lobbying to expand gay rights nationwide.

ranade's ruling enabling gays to get licenses went into effect Monday after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene. But even then, Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore said county judges were not bound by her decision.

'It's my duty to speak up when I see the jurisdiction of our courts being intruded by unlawful federal authority,' Moore insisted in an interview with The Associated Press later Monday.

About 20 of Alabama's counties allowed gays and lesbians to wed on Monday. By Friday that number had jumped to at least 47, the Human Rights Campaign said. Other counties said they would revisit the decision next week.

Granade's ruling made Alabama the 37th state where gays and lesbians can legally wed.

While many Republican politicians in Alabama criticized her ruling last month and tried to link her to Obama administration policies, Granade was appointed to the federal bench by President George W. Bush.

Granade could have stayed her decision pending a final U.S. Supreme Court ruling, as federal judges in Mississippi and Arkansas did. Instead, she rejected Alabama's argument that keeping gays and lesbians from marrying benefits the state's children. And after Moore urged judges this week to ignore her ruling, she reiterated that they are bound by the U.S. Constitution to treat all couples equally.

Moore's stand against federal authority surprised no one in Alabama, where the 68-year-old jurist who twice ran for governor burnished his conservative image a decade ago with a losing fight to keep his Ten Commandments statue inside the Alabama Judicial Building.

While Moore again appeared on the losing side Friday, a longtime supporter said the 81 percent of Alabama voters who chose to ban gay marriage in 2006 would appreciate his stand.

'I think this lady judge is scaring the daylights out of these people,' Orange Beach businessman Dean Young said. 'The people are very thankful that Judge Moore is standing up.'
