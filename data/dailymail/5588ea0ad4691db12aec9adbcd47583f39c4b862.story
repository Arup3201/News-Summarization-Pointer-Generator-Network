North Korea made threats to the London School of Economics before the row over the BBC’s controversial undercover film went public.

The dictatorship warned that the ten students who visited its capital with Panorama journalists would be exposed if the documentary were broadcast. In a letter to the BBC, the university then made plain its anger, arguing that the students had been put in danger and had not been properly informed about the risks.

But the Corporation flatly rejected the demands not to broadcast, insisting that the students were told about the plans. The programme aired as planned last Monday and was watched by 5.1 million people.

Controversy: Panorama reporter John Sweeney with a North Korean colonel. Sweeney travelled to the country with students from the London School of Economics, which was reportedly threatened by Pyongyang before the programme aired

An LSE spokesman denied yesterday that its protest was motivated only by the threats to publish the students’ passport details.

The Mail on Sunday has learned that several days before the row surfaced, the university was contacted by a North Korean government aide, Alejandro Cao de Benos.

Mr Cao de Benos, a Spaniard, spends six months a year in Pyongyang, where he has close ties with senior figures in the dictatorship. He hosts foreign delegations and acts as an intermediary for external parties wanting to invest, make documentaries or simply visit the country.

The rest of the year he acts as a roving ambassador, making media appearances and effectively acting as a government spokesman.

In an email to the BBC on April 9, he said he was ‘in communication with LSE representatives regarding the abuse of the name of their  institution and other students’. He warned that broadcasting the  programme would leave him no choice but to ‘expose all the real story and data’.

In the fall-out from the affair, six of the ten students turned on the university, claiming that it has placed them in greater danger than the trip itself. They complained that the decision to speak publicly about the expedition, led by the Panorama presenter John Sweeney, had exposed them to threats from Pyongyang.

In an open letter to LSE director Craig Calhoun and chairman Peter Sutherland, the students said: ‘We feel that we have now been put in more risk than was originally the case, as a result of the LSE’s decision to go public with their story.’

The students said they were told in London that a journalist would accompany them and that they risked deportation or detention if the true purpose of the trip were uncovered.

In Beijing, before they flew to Pyongyang, they were informed that Sweeney was the journalist and that he worked for the BBC.

But responding to the students’ letter, the LSE’s director of external relations, Robin Hoggard, said: ‘All ten of you were deliberately deceived, by the BBC’s own admission. You weren’t in a position to give informed consent.

‘And it isn’t just about you. What the BBC have done has had implications for not just the whole LSE community, perhaps especially our academics, but for LSE as an institution and for independent academics more widely.

‘Finally, we did not “go public”. The BBC put us in an impossible position. We knew that LSE would be publicly identified if any LSE students were recognisable on Panorama (several were). And even if they weren’t, the North Korean regime had threatened to reveal the details of all of you on the visit, and how the journalists gained entry to North Korea by claiming to be LSE  students or staff.’
