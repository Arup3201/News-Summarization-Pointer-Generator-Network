An obese couch potato that would only exercise when bribed with ham has shed a quarter of her body weight to be crowned pet slimmer of the year.

Daisy the bulldog, from Middlesborough, is the top loser of 2014, beating off stiff competition from other porky pooches, fat cats and even bulging bunnies.

The six-year-old dog, nicknamed Lazy Daisy by her owners, weighed  28.3kg, or 4st 6lbs, making her 50 per cent heavier than she should be.

Thanks to the PDSA's Pet Fit Club she lost 27 per cent of her body weight and now weighs 20.3 kg

But thanks to the PDSA's Pet Fit Club she lost 8kg or 1st and 3.5lbs, which is equal to 27 per cent of her body weight.

Owner, Gillian Turrell, 60, had tried to help her to slim down, encouraging her to go on a treadmill under her close supervision, plus walks to gradually increase Daisy's exercise levels.

But her beloved pet just detested exercise and when out walking had even been known to jump into any available car to catch a ride home when she'd had enough, leading to her nickname.

Gillian said: 'Daisy always begged for food, and has even been known to steal things out of the fridge.

'I also got into the habit of spoiling her with treats and titbits. The weight crept up slowly, and I didn't notice how big she'd got.

'When I couldn't get the car harness around her, and she was struggling to get up the stairs, I knew things had to change. I love Daisy to bits, and I want the best for her, so when I heard about PDSA's Pet Fit Club, it was the perfect solution to helping her lose the weight.

'The difference in Daisy is amazing. Losing the weight has really improved her mobility.

'Before she struggled to climb the stairs but now she sprints up them, and she has a waist again.

'I'm so grateful to the vet staff at Middlesbrough PDSA Pet Hospital for their help and guidance, and for how they've helped to transform Daisy's life.'

PDSA Senior Vet Elaine Pendlebury said: 'Daisy looks absolutely amazing since shedding the pounds in Pet Fit Club. The weight loss means Daisy will feel much fitter and happier, and her life expectancy may well be improved now than she's shed the excess weight.

'I'd encourage any owner who has concerns about their own pet's weight to discuss it with their vet. Vets and nurses are there to help and can provide lots of guidance on pet feeding and exercise.'

The new-look Daisy was one of 11 obese pets selected to embark on the pet slimming regime.

Animals were put through a six-month diet and exercise programme overseen by vets, leading to one being crowned a super slimmer. 

In total, the pets have lost a combined weight of 30kg (4st 7lbs) - the weight of a typical nine-year-old child.

And statistics show that more and more pets in the UK are becoming obese.

New findings from PDSA's annual Animal Wellbeing (PAW) Report have revealed that 81 per cent of vets have seen an increase in levels of pet obesity over the last two years.

And four in five (80 per cent) of vets believe there will be more overweight pets than healthy weight pets in the next five years.

The vast majority (89 per cent) of pet owners are aware that pets can suffer from obesity-related health issues such as diabetes, heart disease and arthritis, yet the number of fat pets continues to rise. 

Nine in ten (88 per cent) of owners acknowledge that overweight pets will have a shortened life span. 

The winner of the fat fighting contest will be revealed in a new TV show on ITV1 today called Fat Pets: Slimmer of the Year, presented by Angela Griffin and Kian Egan.

Gillian has won a pet-friendly holiday as well as a year's free supply of Hill's pet food, to help keep Daisy at her ideal weight.

Other top pet slimmers in PDSA Pet Fit Club

Bruce

Heavyweight Boxer dog Bruce from Rochester in Kent lost almost 11kg (nearly 2st) after taking part in PDSA Pet Fit Club.

The formerly podgy pooch gave up his favourite breakfast of Weetabix with goats' milk and honey to shed the pounds on the six month diet and exercise plan, helped by his owner Thomas Cummins, 56. 

Bruce originally weighed in at 55 kg (8st 9lb) making him about 60 per cent overweight and morbidly obese. 

But with expert help from vets and nurses at Gillingham PDSA Pet Hospital, Bruce lost a fifth of his total body weight. He now weighs in at a much healthier 44kg (6st 13lb), and is well on the way to reaching his ideal weight.

Former gigantic Ginger tom Zorro from Dundee is now a swashbuckling hero after losing an impressive 20 per cent of his bodyweight. 

Zorro was nearly double the size he should be, boasting a whopping 63cm waist and his weight - 9.4kg - had become such an issue that he had problems grooming himself. 

But his owner, Linda Petrie, 51, says she no longer has to help him stay in condition after he shed 1.9kg and lost 13cm from his waist.

Millie

Doner kebab-loving Millie the Jack Russell, 12, from Newcastle, lost a fifth of her bodyweight in the six-month diet and exercise plan. 

The formerly podgy pooch, who has arthritis, used to enjoy junk food snacks as well as calorie-laden Yorkshire puddings but these were banned to help her shed the pounds. 

Millie originally weighed in at 9.3kg (1st 8lbs), making her about 43 per cent overweight. 

But with expert help from vets and nurses at Newcastle PDSA Pet Hospital, to the delight of owner Melanie Smith, 20, Millie is now a much healthier 7.5 kg (1st 2lbs) and she is now more active and suffers less from problems with her joints.
