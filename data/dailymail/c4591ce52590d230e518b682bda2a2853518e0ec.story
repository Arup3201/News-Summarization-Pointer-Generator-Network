Apple's iPad has been a huge hit among children, with its easy to use interface and innovative apps.

In fact, researchers say the astonishing rise of the iPad has meant is has now overtaken household names such as McDonalds and Disney to become the number one brand among American 6-12 year olds.

The annual study, conducted by leading youth and family research firm Smarty Pants, ranks more than 250 brands each year.

In the firm's 2014 study, Apple's iPad trumps iconic kid brands such as McDonald's, Toys'R'Us, Nickelodeon, and Disney.

Young Love is conducted online among a representative sample of U.S. households with children ages 6-12. 

In 2014, a total of 256 consumer brands across more than 20 categories were evaluated as part of the three-month study of 6,661 children and their parents. 

The scores, called Kidfinity, are a composite measure on a scale of 0-1000 that factor in brand awareness, love and popularity. 

'iPad's number one status among kids represents the culmination of the 'tablet takeover' – a movement from shared screens and TV network dominance to curated content on personal devices,' said Wynne Tyree, president of Smarty Pants.

'Kids increasingly turn to iPad for games, TV shows, videos, books, homework help and communicating with friends and family.'

In the firm's 2014 study, Apple's iPad trumps iconic kid brands such as McDonald's, Toys'R'Us, Nickelodeon, and Disney. 

Kids see the iPad as the all-in-one digital tool, giving them a unique sense of independence, the researchers say.  

Tyree notes that iPad's march to the top has been dramatic. 

'In just five years, the iPad has risen from ranking 109th to being kids' favorite brand. 

'Early on, it captured the hearts of tweens and middle and upper class families, but iPad is now an indispensable part of childhood for the masses.'

Over all, on the study iPad was tops with a weighted score of 898 out of 1000. 

The Apple tablet was followed by Hershey’s (894), Oreo (885), M&M’s (883), Doritos (868), Cheetos (864), with Skittles and Disney tied at 858.

Google’s YouTube came in at 852, followed by Microsoft Xbox (850); Lay’s (847); Kit Kat and Nickelodeon (846); Crayola (842); McDonald’s (839); Nintendo Wii (838); and Reese’s, Chips Ahoy! and iPod tying at 836. 

Netflix came in at 833, followed by iPhone (830), Toys ‘R’ Us (830) and Apple (829).

The iPad's popularity has even led to accesories aimed at toddlers such as the iPotty for iPad potty training device.

Digital entertainment overall is seeing a surge among kids and families, with brands such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, Android, and Samsung posting noteworthy increases in  the study, a measure of kids' awareness, popularity, and love for a brand. 

Along with iPad, these devices and services provide entertainment that is 'always on.' 

Offering seemingly endless options, tablets and digital content providers are meeting contemporary kids' needs – with fun and connectivity never more than a tap away.
