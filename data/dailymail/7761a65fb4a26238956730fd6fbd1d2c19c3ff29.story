Nigel Pearson has revealed he has been backed by his fellow bosses after his foul-mouthed outburst at a Leicester City fan earlier this month.

Pearson was filmed appearing to tell an abusive supporter to ‘f*** off and die’ after being called an ‘utter t***’ near the end of City’s defeat by Liverpool at the King Power Stadium on December 2.

He has been charged by the FA but said has the support of his fellow managers.

Pearson has revealed the backing he has received from fellow bosses after his outburst

'When I speak to other managers, they have empathy for my situation,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

'They've been there. They understand what it is like.'

One boss told Pearson: 'You said what all the rest of us wanted to say'. 

Pearson has until Tuesday evening to respond to the charge but has so far been unrepentant.

He said last week: ‘I’m more than happy to stand up for myself in that situation. If people were offended then that is regrettable but there is no need to apologise to somebody of that ilk.’ 

The 51-year-old has also defended Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger after he came under fierce criticism from the club's fans.

Supporters also held up a banner which read: 'Thanks for the memories but it’s time to say goodbye.'

Pearson said: 'I don’t know how that can happen. That’s appalling for someone who has fundamentally changed the club and won a trophy last season. I find it bemusing that people’s tolerance is so short-lived.

'It’s society. Football is just a conduit for people’s anger. With the amount of political correctness in life now, people almost need a vehicle to show their emotions.'
