The number of shark attacks in waters around the United States reached the highest level seen in more than a decade last year.

There were 53 attacks in the U.S. in 2012 - the most since 2000, which saw the same number of incidents recorded.

The 2012 figure - which includes one fatal shark attack - is a significant increase on the 31 incidents recorded in the United States the previous year.

coast of Florida, according to the University of Florida's International
 Shark Attack File.

Fatal attack: A sign at Surf Beach, near Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, after surfer Francisco Javier Solorio Jr was killed by a Great White Shark in October

A total of 26 attacks were recorded in Florida, 10 in Hawaii, and five in California - one of which was fatal.

South Carolina also saw five attacks, while Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon and Puerto Rico all recorded one each.

In December Tom Kennedy, 61, from Oregon, suffered a serious gash on his left leg when he was bitten by a ten-foot tiger shark as he was snorkelling off the coast of Maui, Hawaii.

Mr Kennedy swam for his life when the deadly shark released his leg, managing to reach the safety of his paddle board and summon a friend for help.

In October a Californian surfer had a lucky escape after being bitten by a shark off the coast of North Jetty in South Bay.

The predator left the 25-year-old with a series of wounds on his torso, and also managed to bite an enormous chunk out of his surfboard before a passing off-duty paramedic rushed to the man's aid at Samoa Beach, near Eureka.

The shock attack occurred just a week after another surfer, Francisco Javier Solorio Jr, was attacked by a Great White Shark in Santa Barbara as his friend looked on in horror.

The 39-year-old died after the enormous shark sank its teeth into his torso in the waters off Surf Beach on Vandenberg Air Force Base.

Mr Solorio was pronounced dead at the scene despite the desperate efforts of his friend, who dragged him from the water on to the beach where he administered first aid.

damage to his lower legs.

At 26, the total number of attacks in Florida in 2012 was close to the yearly average of 23 recorded between 2001 and 2010. The state is typically the location of the highest number of unprovoked shark attacks in the U.S.

According to the University of Florida's report, the most dangerous swimming spots within the state were Brevard and Volusia counties, which saw eight and seven attacks respectively.

The report, which looks at shark attacks worldwide, said there were seven fatalities in 2012 - less than in 2011 but above the yearly average of 4.4 from 2001 to 2010.

There were 80 unprovoked attacks worldwide, slightly more than in 2011, in which 78 shock incidents were recorded around the world.

In 60 per cent of cases the victims were surfers or those participating in other board sports.
