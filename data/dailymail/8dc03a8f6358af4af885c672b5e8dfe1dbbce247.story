Apology: Daniel Avila made the claims about the devil being responsible for homosexuality in America's oldest Catholic newspaper

The oldest Roman Catholic newspaper in the United States has retracted a column suggesting the devil may be responsible for same-sex attraction.

The opinion piece, which appeared on Friday in the Archdiocese of Boston's official newspaper, The Pilot, was titled 'Some fundamental questions on same-sex attraction.'

Its author said that 'the scientific evidence of how same-sex attraction most likely may be created provides a credible basis for a spiritual explanation that indicts the devil.'

The controversial piece was written 
by Daniel Avila, an associate director for policy and research for the 
U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.

It
 also says 'disruptive imbalances in nature that thwart encoded 
processes point to supernatural actors who, unlike God, do not have the 
good of persons at heart.'

The
 column goes on to claim that when 'natural causes disturb otherwise 
typical biological development, leading to the personally unchosen 
beginnings of same-sex attraction, the ultimate responsibility, on a 
theological level, is and should be imputed to the evil one, not God.'

Controversy: The 182-year-old newspaper had to withdraw the opinion piece after recognising a 'theological error'

The
 182-year-old newspaper withdrew the column from its website on 
Wednesday, saying it had failed to recognize the 'theological error' 
before publication.

It posted an apology from Avila 
saying the column didn't represent the position of the Conference of 
Catholic Bishops, whose stated purpose is to 'promote the greater good 
which the Church offers humankind,' and wasn't authorized for 
publication.

Archdiocesan
 officials said Avila's apology would appear in the issue of The Pilot 
to be published this week, The Boston Globe reported.

Avila said same-sex attraction 'should be imputed to the evil one, not God'

The Boston archdiocese, the bishops' 
group and Avila were involved in communications leading to the decision 
to retract the column, said archdiocese spokesman Terrence Donilon, who 
called Avila 'passionate about his faith and passionate about his 
church.'

'This one,' Donilon said, 'clearly just got away from him.'

Avila
 issued a statement saying: 'The Church opposes, as I do too, all unjust
 discrimination and the violence against persons that unjust 
discrimination inspires.

'I deeply apologize for the hurt and confusion that this column has caused.'

The Massachusetts gay rights group MassEquality didn't immediately return a telephone message seeking comment Wednesday night.
