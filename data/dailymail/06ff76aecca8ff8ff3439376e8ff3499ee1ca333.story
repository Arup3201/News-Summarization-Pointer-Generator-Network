If missing out on the World Cup wasn't bad enough, Zlatan Ibrahimovic was forced to watch from the bench as Sweden slumped to a 1-0 defeat against neighbours Denmark on Wednesday night.

Ibrahimovic was hooked at half-time after failing to find a way past a resilient Denmark defence, and things got even worse for the PSG striker when Liverpool's Daniel Agger scored a last-gasp penalty to consign his side to defeat in Copenhagen.

The home side dominated the first half with Christian Eriksen, Martin Braithwaite and Michael Krohn-Dehli all denied in the opening period.

Leicester City keeper Kasper Schmeichel was a virtual spectator in goal but had to be alert to stop Kim Kallstrom’s strike.

Schmeichel had more to do after the break, thwarting Kallstrom and Panathinaikos striker Marcus Berg before Agger popped up to snatch victory for Denmark at the death with a cool spot-kick.

Wednesday’s friendly was the 102 time the Scandinavians have faced each other in 101 years.
