For those looking to book a holiday this festive season, Christmas may have come early.

Over half of the top 20 best value getaways have fallen in price since last year, mainly due to the strength of the pound.

And for the best value deal this Christmas, you'd do well to head to Europe - in particular, Belgium.

Research from M&S Bank has found Belgium to be the most affordable traditional Christmas destination this year. 

With its colder climate and festive activities, such as sleigh rides, Santa's grotto, Christmas markets and outdoor ice skating, Belgium is a great option for families looking for a quick winter break. 

With costs of just £420 per person, the country also sees an almost 5 per cent decrease in price since last year.

Germany is not far behind, costing just £453 per person, which is almost four per cent cheaper than this time last year.

Germany is also a good-value traditional option, with costs for a week holiday coming in at £453 per person

For those looking for winter sun, however, the news isn't quite as cheery.

Only two warm-weather destinations are included in the top ten most affordable holiday list: Cyprus and the Canary Islands.

Spain's Canary Islands is another more affordable winter sun getaway option at £1,248 per person per week

While you may be guaranteed mild weather in the Canaries - average December temperatures top 19 degrees Celsius - it will come with a high price tag of £1,248 per person. 

For some serious winter heat, Thailand has the highest temperatures - and the highest cost per person, with prices having risen by £293 in the last two years.  

The Bahamas also boasts pleasant temperatures at this time of year, with an average of 22 degrees Celsius in December. 

However, it is the second most expensive winter sun destination, with a cost of £3,029 per person.

Mexico has seen the biggest price increase overall (2.1 per cent, or £114 in total), but at a cost of £1,377 per person it is still the third most affordable winter sun destination out of those researched.

The most expensive winter sun locale? Thailand has both the highest December temperatures and prices

Paul Stokes, head of products at M&S Bank, said: 'Families looking for a more traditional Christmas holiday will find plenty of savings to be had, with prices falling across the board, largely thanks to the strength of the pound against the euro.

'However, those hoping for some winter sun this year will have to pay a premium for higher temperatures, particularly to long-haul destinations. 

'Travellers can often get a better rate on their currency if they plan ahead, helping to ensure their spending money goes that bit further.'
