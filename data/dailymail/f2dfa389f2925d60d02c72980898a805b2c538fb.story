Father-of-three Gordon Hendricks, 43, (above) has been crowned the most convincing Elvis tribute act

The world’s best Elvis impersonator has been unveiled – as a barber from Stoke-on-Trent called Gordon.

Gordon Hendricks, a 43-year-old father of three, was stunned when judges at the Collingwood Elvis Festival in Canada named him the most convincing tribute act to the King.

Watched by Priscilla Presley, Gordon was handed the prestigious title last Saturday after blowing them away with his rendition of Elvis' top hits.

‘When they told me I had won I was just amazed,’ he said yesterday on his return home. ‘I still can’t believe it fully now.

‘I got through to the top three and that was amazing, but then when I performed American Trilogy it just felt right.’ 

He has sung Elvis songs since he was a small child and began performing in local clubs for £50 a night in 2003 ‘because I enjoyed it’.

But since winning TV’s Stars In Their Eyes contest in 2005, he has progressed to touring the UK with a 22-piece backing band. He has also appeared on the Graham Norton Show.

‘Since then it has been a whirlwind,’ he said. ‘I would never have guessed I would be doing this when I first started out.’

However, despite his newfound fame, he still cuts hair three days a week at his barber shop in Stoke called Hendricks - which is run by his two sons.

He said he credits his success to 'never forgetting about Elvis'.

He said: 'I think a lot of people forget that it is about him, not them.

'At these competitions it becomes about the impersonator, they have fan groups just there to support them.

'I try and never forget about Elvis. He is the reason we are there, it is his talent that means we can do what we do.

'I started off with Elvis when I was about three or four, I couldn't help it really, I grew up in a family who loved him.

'You are a sponge at that age and I just absorbed it all.

'When I grew up I moved on and got a real job, but it was always my party trick to do impressions, and I would always do Elvis songs at karaoke.

'In 2003 I started doing the odd club and pub for about £50 a time because I enjoyed it.

'Then in 2005 I was on Stars In Their Eyes doing Elvis, and I won the competition.

'Since then it has been a whirlwind. I would never have guessed I would be doing this when I first started out.

'The competition was amazing, to perform in front of Priscilla Presley was just wonderful.

'I got through to the top three and that was amazing, but then when I performed American Trilogy it just felt right.

'When they told me I had won I was just amazed. I still can't believe it fully now.

'They told me I was bound for big things with my act and I just couldn't believe it.' 

He admits wife Amanda, 32, had barely heard of Elvis when the pair met and sneaky Gordon didn't reveal his talent until she saw him on TV.

He added: 'She is a big fan now.

'She is a bit younger than me, so listened to completely different stuff.

'I didn't tell her what I did at first, we just met at a bar and got chatting, I told her I was a hairdresser and that was it.

'She didn't find out until she saw me on Graham Norton's show. She asked me if that was me and I told her all about it.

'She was amazed and had had no idea and no real idea about Elvis before.'
