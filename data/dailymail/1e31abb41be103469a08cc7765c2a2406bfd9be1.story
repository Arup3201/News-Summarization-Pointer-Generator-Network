The case of a pregnant 11-year old girl who was raped in Chile by her mother's partner has set off a national debate about abortion in one of the most socially-conservative countries in Latin America.

State TV reported that doctors say the girl, who is 14 weeks pregnant, is at high risk for her life and the life of her unborn child.

However, she is unable to terminate her pregnancy because in Chille abortion is illegal under any circumstances.

A national debate has begun in Chile where abortion is illegal after an 11-year-old got pregnant from rape. Seen here a Chilean pro-choice demonstrator protests against a court decision halting government distribution of free "morning-after" pills

Chile allowed abortions for medical reasons until they were outlawed in 1973 by General Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship.

The current government of conservative President Sebastian Pinera has opposed any loosening of the prohibition.

In the case of this young girl, who The Globe and Mail identify as 'Belen,' doctors say her life and the life of the fetus are at high risk.

However, due to the country's abortion laws ending the pregnancy is not an option.

Many Chileans have vented their outrage over this case on social media.

Some have started an online campaign to demand legalization of abortion in cases of rape or health risks for the mother.

Chile's Senate rejected three bills last year that would have eased the absolute ban on abortions.

One of the bills would have permitted abortion when two doctors said it was needed because of risks to a mother's life or other medical reasons, such as a fetus with low chances of survival.

Another of the measures rejected would have allowed abortion in the event of rape.

Police arrested Belen's mother's partner who confessed to the fifth-grader.
