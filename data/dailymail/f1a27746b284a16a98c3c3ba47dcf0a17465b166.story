The rare chance to live a castaway lifestyle while actually only a stone’s throw from civilisation has become available after a tiny island went on the market.

Derwent Island is a beautiful secluded seven acre retreat that has an 18th century home hidden among the woodland but though impressive, it wasn't a hit 
with all the locals - it is said that celebrated poet William 
Wordsworth was offended by the design of the house and thought it spoilt
the view.

The island sits just 150 yards from the shoreline of the Lake District’s Derwent Water and just half-a-mile from the bustling market town of Keswick offering residents a rare chance to be both part of a thriving local community and live in picturesque isolation.

Derwent Island is a secluded seven acre retreat that has an 18th century home hidden among the woodland

Spectacular views: Free from cars the island feels completely cut off from civilisation and even the milk is delivered daily by canoe

Opulent: The new tenants get to enjoy buy must enjoy but also care for the opulent home and furniture

The unique location is owned by the National Trust which rents out the the grade II listed property on a long term let in excess of 40,000 pounds a year.

The lease on the stunning six-bed home has become available for the first time in 10 years and already the agents handling the tenancy are preparing themselves to be inundated with applications.

The lucky tenants will get two motorboat launches for the five minute trip to the mainland and a quad bike to get around the isle.

Once on the island the feeling of total isolation is complete but a milkman delivering a daily pint from a canoe should be enough to keep visitors civilised.

The property on the island, which was 
formerly known as Vicar’s Island, was built by eccentric banker Joseph 
Pocklington in the 18th century.

There is also a large garage in the lakeside village of Portinscale where a car can be stashed for excusions to the mainland.

But this dreamy island idle does come with certain restrictions in the tenancy.

Training: New residents will be trained by the National Trust to look after all the valuable art works, antiques and furniture at Derwent House

The house is situated on Derwent Island, one of four in the lake including Lord's Island, St Herbert's Island, and Rampsholme Island.

The new tenants will be able to take one of the two motor boats to the nearby market town of Keswick if they can tear themselves away from the gorgeous interior

The property has to be manned all year round and must be opened up to visitors for five days of the year.

The occupiers will also be trained in how to look after important antiques, art works and furniture in the Georgian house and must also prove that they are 'fairly robust.'

Helen Lancaster, of letting agents Carter Jonas, said: 'It has been the principal residency for 10 years of the outgoing tenants.

'The husband has got a business in the north west that he travels to but he has been lucky enough to have been able to work from home.

Room with a view: wherever you are in the house, the huge windows mean you never miss out on the incredible surroundings

Home sweet home: the last tenants used the mansion for 10 years but have finally decided to move out, though it is hard to imagine why

'The property is new to the market but we have already had wide-ranging interest from private individuals to CEOs of companies.

'Obviously this appeals to people who want to get away from it all and live a secluded lifestyle. It is easy to get romantic about this beautiful isle in the middle of a lake.

'But from another point of view, the practicalities involved of things like lugging bags of shopping onto a boat is less romantic.

'There is an application process that 
will involve an interview. People must be financially robust to take it 
on as well as show they can take on the mantle of custodian of a 
historic property for the National Trust.

House share: whoever rents the house will have to get used to guests as the property must be opened to the public for at least five days a year

The six-bedroom house is nestled into stunning woodland and has acres of private land which tenants can explore by quad bike

After a summer spent on the lake and in the surrounding countryside the lucky occupants can spend the winter tucked away in the house's library

'They need to fairly robust and have a slight element of the adventurer about them.

The nearby village of Portinscale offers and shops, tea rooms and an important link with civilisation but there is also a supermarket in Kewsick as well as schools.

Mrs Lancaster said: 'There are no cars allowed in the island but it comes with a garage and parking area on the mainland.

'There is an agreement for the milkman to store his canoe in the garage in return for him making a daily delivery to the island.

'Of the two boats, one is shallow-hulled because the lake level rises and falls quite significantly.

'It can sometimes freeze over in the winter which leaves the residents stranded.'
