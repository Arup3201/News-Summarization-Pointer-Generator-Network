New signing Costel Pantilimon made his Sunderland debut at Hartlepool on Wednesday night.

The 6ft 8in keeper, who joined on a free transfer from Manchester City during the summer, was largely a spectator during the pre-season friendly against the League Two side.

Quiet night: New signing Costel Pantilimon made his Sunderland debut at Hartlepool on Wednesday night

Sunderland: Pantilimon, Watmore, Ferguson, Roberge, Oâ€™Shea, Cattermole, Larsson, Ba, Fletcher, Clayton, Johnson

Subs: Pickford, Cartwright, Harrison, Beadling, Robson T, Lawson, Agnew, Gooch, Honeyman, Smith, Mandron

Goals: Lawson, Cartwright 2

Att: 5,617

Adam Johnson was also included in the starting line-up after missing the previous two friendlies at Darlington and Carlisle as a precaution due to an ankle injury.

And the winger was involved in Sunderland's best moves in the first-half.

Johnson flashed a shot just wide of the target before setting up striker Steven Fletcher but his effort rebounded off the post.

Midfielder El Hadji Ba saw a speculative shot fizz past the post just before half-time.

Pantilimon had little to do for an hour but he had to be alert to deal with a shot from Stuart Parnaby.

Boost: Adam Johnson made a welcome appearance for Sunderland after an injury scare

Bonus: Sunderland's youngsters took the chance to impress manager Gus Poyet at Hartlepool

Gus Poyet then changed his entire team with highly-rated 20-year-old Jordan Pickford, who has agreed a season long loan at Bradford after impressing at Darlington and Carlisle, replacing Pantilimon.

Sunderland broke the deadlock when Under 21 striker Carl Lawson curled the ball into the net.

Midfielder Andrew Cartwright then grabbed a quickfire double to seal a 3-0 victory in front of 5,617 fans, 3,252 from Sunderland.
