Global pop icon Rihanna has used her influential position to mock a 16-year-old girl from Baltimore's prom outfit intended to pay tribute to her idol.

Alexis Carter decided to dress like Rihanna at her school's Hollywood-themed prom and had a family friend design her a dark green catsuit with wing-like panels.

Miss Carter's bold outfit, modeled on an ensemble that Rihanna wore in 2010, led to her being cyber-bullied - including several vitriolic tweets from the Grammy-award winner herself.

Global superstar Rihanna posted a picture on Twitter last week mocking a 16-year-old Baltimore teenager for copying her outfit to wear to prom

Alexis Clark, 16, wore the skintight catsuit with wings to her prom because she had loved the outfit on her idol Rihanna. The singer later mocked her for the ensemble

Rihanna, 26, posted a photo of herself wearing the low-cut one-piece, captioned 'IG', alongside a photo go Alexis in her outfit with the caption 'Real Life' and a sad face.

The picture received 9,386 retweets and 11,245 favorites on Twitter.

In another picture, tweeted a few minutes later on May 8, to her 35million followers, Rihanna posted a photo of the teen next to the bat-like logo of the Wu-Tang Clan. She also retweeted the hashtag #PromBat.

The 16-year-old said that when she first saw the green, cape-like outfit that was made especially for her, she said: 'It's cool, I love it, oh my god.'

No haters: Miss Carter says she received nothing but compliments on her outfit at prom

At the prom, she received lots of compliments on her daring look, according to Miss Carter, as she posed up on the red carpet to show off her unusual outfit.

She told Fox: 'Everybody was saying, ''Oh my god, I love it, it looks nice your body looks good it's different.''' 

The picture of Miss Carter in her outfit has now spread across social media and led to tirades of abuse against the teenager. And what hurt Miss Carter the most was that Rihanna had joined in the cyberbullying.

Miss Carter told Fox Baltimore: 'I was very offended. Why throw shade on it when you had on the exact same thing. The poses was different but the outfit wasn't.'

She added: 'She don't love her fans like she says she does.'

It was another blunder for the pop princess after she dropped the phone of Los Angeles Police Commission President Steve Soboroff during an LA Clippers game last Friday.

While attempting to take a selfie of the two of them together
for the police chief, Rihanna dropped his iPhone onto the hard court surface – damaging its 
protective cover in the process.

But the singer quickly redeemed herself. As an act of atonement, she donated $25,000 to a charity fund 
for police officers. Soboroff then placed the phone on online 
auction site eBay – and bids have gone through the roof. 

Last night the phone – signed by Rihanna after the accident – had reached $57,000. Proceeds will be donated to the Los Angeles Police Foundation.
