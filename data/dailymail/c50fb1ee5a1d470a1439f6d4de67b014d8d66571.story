An investigation has been launched following allegations that a patient bled to death while in hospital.

Managers at the Royal Bolton Hospital have set up a serious case review panel after a patient, thought to be a man, died on the high dependency ward in March this year.

A director from the Bolton NHS Foundation Trust will lead the investigation and a report will be presented to the trust board and the NHS Bolton Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG).

The hospital’s head of communications, Heather Edwards, said: ‘We can confirm that we had had an incident in which sadly a patient died unexpectedly.

‘We have set up a serious case review panel to look into this to see what, if anything, could have been done differently.

‘A final report will go to our board, the CCG, and the family once the review has been completed.’ 

The police are not involved in the investigation.

Findings of the investigation could be passed to the coroner once the trust has completed the review.

This is not the first time there have been allegations of unnecessary deaths at the hospital.

In August 2013 an inquest was told that 86-year-old patient James Bent bled to death at the hospital.

He was said to have died after a drip became detached from his hand and no one noticed for two hours.

It is thought a male patient died unexpectedly on the high dependency ward in March

Mr Bent had been placed on an antibiotic drip after being admitted to hospital with numerous health complaints including diarrhoea, heart disease, pancreatitis and cirrhosis of the liver.

But two hours later he was found collapsed in bed with a pool of blood on the floor after the drip tube feeding him the antibiotics became detached from the cannula - the plastic piece of apparatus connecting the tube to the vein - causing his blood to flow out of the opening.

Staff at Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester immediately stopped the bleeding but Mr Bent went into cardiac arrest and could not be resuscitated.

Recording a narrative verdict, the coroner said Mr Bent 'died as a consequence of the accidental detachment of a giving set (drip tube apparatus) used to administer intravenous antibiotics from a three way tap connected to a cannula inserted into an arm vein against a background of naturally occurring and alcohol related disease.'

The Royal Bolton Hospital also came under scrutiny in 2006 after three women died in childbirth during a four month period.

All three women were expected to have normal deliveries but died in similar circumstances.
