Downing Street was thrown into panic last night by a rebel Tory bid to force an early referendum on quitting the EU.

In a direct challenge to the Prime Minister’s authority, Conservative MP Adam Afriyie said people did not trust David Cameron’s pledge to hold a vote on Europe in 2017.

Backed by Tory and Labour Eurosceptics, he is set to force a Commons vote on the issue in five weeks’ time.

If he wins, it would mean Parliament had ruled that the referendum should be fast-forwarded to next October.

Panic: Conservative MP Adam Afriyie, left, has said that people do not trust a pledge made by David Cameron, right, to hold a vote on Europe in 2017

Mr Cameron reacted with fury when he learned of the proposal last night – and immediately vowed to stop it at all costs.

Downing Street made it clear the Prime Minister will refuse point-blank to accelerate the referendum.

In a defiant response, a No 10 spokesman said: ‘We will not allow this amendment to be passed under any circumstances. The PM will not let it stand.’

Aides would not say how the PM intended to veto the amendment but he is prepared to withdraw the entire legislation if Mr Afriyie wins.

And he may simply defy the parliamentary vote.

It sets the scene for an extraordinary confrontation when MPs vote on the issue on November 8.

Critics will contrast that stance with Mr Cameron’s compliance with the will of Parliament when it voted against him on military action in Syria.

Rebel: Mr Afriyie, who says Britain should cut its ties with Brussels unless key powers are returned, claims he has ¿widespread support¿ from Tory and Labour MPs

A senior Government source said: ‘This is a deliberate attempt to sabotage the Prime Minister’s referendum plan. It is simply not possible to renegotiate our membership of the EU in under 12 months.’

Windsor MP Mr Afriyie, who earlier this year was accused of plotting a Tory leadership bid, has even named the exact date he wants the referendum: October 23 – the anniversary of the Battle of El Alamein, the turning point in the Second World War.

Mr Afriyie, a self-made millionaire, will tomorrow table an amendment to the legislation which paves the way for the 2017 vote in an attempt to bring it forward to 2014.

The rebel, who says Britain should cut its ties with Brussels unless key powers are returned, claims he has ‘widespread support’ from Tory and Labour MPs.

End game: Mr Afriyie says his plan will end the row over Britain¿s place in Europe once and for all and kill off the threat UKIP¿s Nigel Farage (pictured) poses to the Tories

He says it will end the row over Britain’s place in Europe once and for all and kill off the threat UKIP’s Nigel Farage poses to the Tories.

However, when Downing Street found out about Mr Afriyie’s challenge, alarm bells rang.

If a referendum was held next year, the stakes could not be higher for Mr Cameron. He would almost certainly call for a pro-EU vote.

If the British people voted to go it alone, he could be forced to resign, triggering a Tory leadership contest seven months before the General Election due in May 2015.

But if the nation opted to stay in the EU, it could enhance Mr Cameron’s standing and pave the way for victory at the Election.

Mr Cameron’s allies last night dismissed Mr Afriyie’s plan as ‘fantasy politics’.

One said: ‘Afriyie has no real support and to suggest he is going to force us to bring the referendum to 2014 is absurd.’

Tory backbencher James Wharton, the Cameron loyalist who is sponsoring the 2017 EU Referendum Bill, vented his anger at Mr Afriyie, claiming his amendment could kill off the referendum completely.

The Stockton MP warned: ‘Adam’s proposal will not make the progress of the Bill more likely. In fact, it will make it significantly less likely.’

Mr Wharton backs Mr Cameron’s approach of renegotiating Britain’s membership terms with Brussels, and holding  an EU referendum after the next Election.

The Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this year how Mr Afriyie and other Tory MPs critical of Mr Cameron had met secretly.

He denied trying to undermine the Prime Minister, but he will face fresh claims  of disloyalty as a result of a provocative article in today’s Mail on Sunday in which he:

‘The Prime Minister says we are going to have an EU referendum in 2017,’ writes Mr Afriyie. ‘The British people .  .  . don’t understand why we can’t have one right away – and that makes them suspicious.

Memorable date: General Bernard Montgomery during the advance on El Alamein. Afriyie has picked October 23 for referendum ¿ the anniversary of the Battle of El Alamein, the turning point in the Second World War

'Many people think delaying the vote is just a tactic to allow all the political leaders to kick the can even further down the road.

'To achieve the land of opportunity .  .  . we must resolve our relationship with Europe and that should not wait until 2017.’

He said delays on the vote will drive large numbers of voters to UKIP, leading to ‘a distinct danger that Labour will gain a majority and we will never see a referendum at all’.

Mr Afriyie said opinion polls showed that the majority of people want a referendum before the next Election.

Linking the date with El Alamein echoes the decision by SNP leader Alex Salmond to hold next year’s Scottish independence referendum on the anniversary of Scotland’s victory at the Battle of Bannockburn.

Headache: The initiative poses problems for Labour leader Ed Miliband, left, who has refused to back a referendum while Nick Clegg, right, will launch an open attack this week on Cameron for calling a referendum

Mr Afriyie claims that the choice of October 23 is a coincidence, and is the ‘only practical date’ for the vote next year.

His initiative also poses a headache for Ed Miliband.

So far the Labour leader has refused to back any referendum, but some of his MPs could use the amendment to rebel against him.

In a separate development, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will this week launch an open attack on Mr Cameron for calling a referendum, claiming quitting the EU would be ‘economic suicide’ and  accusing Mr Cameron of ‘threatening to flounce out of Europe’.

New role? Sajid Javid

A Tory MP who has been tipped as a future Chancellor is in line for rapid advancement in a Government reshuffle this week.

Treasury Minister Sajid Javid, the son of a bus driver, will be given a senior ministerial job at ‘the door of the Cabinet’ by David Cameron, as the Prime Minister hands out promotions to the brightest members of the 2010 intake of Tory MPs.

Comprehensive-educated  Mr Javid, 43, has only been in the Commons since 2010.

But the Muslim former banker, who is politically close to George Osborne, has impressed colleagues as a junior Treasury Minister and is seen as a safe pair of hands both in the Commons and in media interviews.

One of five sons, Mr Javid was born in Rochdale, Lancashire, but brought up in a crime-ridden area of Bristol.

He became a vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank at just 25 and later a director of Deutsche Bank.

But, inspired by Margaret Thatcher’s premiership, Mr Javid, who is married with four children, gave up banking to focus on politics.

His wife Laura is a Christian, sparking Mr Javid to say last year: ‘She goes to church more often than I go to mosque.’

The Prime Minister is being urged by advisers to promote women, ethnic minority MPs, northern MPs and those from less affluent backgrounds.

The drive follows findings by focus groups that the party is still regarded as a bastion for white, middle-class, southern males.

Speculation that a reshuffle was imminent heightened on Friday when Rail Minister Simon Burns quit – to fight for the vacant post of Commons Deputy Speaker – and was not immediately replaced.

Labour leader Ed Miliband  is also expected to carry out  a reshuffle this week, with Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rachel Reeves backed to replace Liam  Byrne as Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary.

Douglas Alexander is expected to keep his job as Shadow Foreign Secretary, but also be handed the job of the party’s campaign co-ordinator, succeeding Tom Watson.
