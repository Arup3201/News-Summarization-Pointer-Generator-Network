Andrea Petkovic was visibly riled by the quality of officiating during her 7-5, 6-3 loss to Zarina Diyas at the Dubai Tennis Championships. 

With the score poised at 5-6 in the first set, the German let a deep shot bounce as it landed clearly beyond the baseline. 

Strangely, however, the decision given was that the ball was in and Petkovic crashed to her knees in frustration, banging her hands while screaming and pleading to the umpire, who remained unmoved by her protest.

Petkovic then faced a set point as Diyas served.

Her return hit the net though and gave Diyas the set 7-5, prompting Petkovic to throw her racquet in anger towards the bench, narrowly missing the linesman. 

For the rest of the contest, Diyas took advantage of her opponent's mental snap and loss of concentration.
