For a generation of women, Carrie Bradshaw was synonymous with sex, shopping and, above all else, shoes.

Her walk-in wardrobe may have been crammed with designer clothes and handbags, but her skyscraper Manolos, Louboutins and Jimmy Choos were the real stars of Sex And The City. So it’s no surprise that Sarah Jessica Parker has designed her own shoe range inspired by her character’s collection.

But are they anywhere near as stylish — and are they as agonising to walk in as Carrie’s towering shoes looked? RUBY WARRINGTON puts them to the test ...

Will Ruby Warrington's (right) feet survive the shoes of Carrie Bradshaw (left)?

Floral and feminine: Sarah Jessica Parker teaming a floral dress with monochrome shoes on the set of Sex and the City

The Maud, £225THE LOOK: Dainty and a very sensible three-and-a-quarter inch heel height. The toe has a classy criss-cross effect and the delicate strap fastens with a gold buckle. BEST FOR: Everyday wear. So comfortable and lightweight, I barely feel like I’m wearing anything — it’s like floating on air.WORST FOR: Rainy days — but apart from that, a winner all round. SJP shows it can be done!Comfort rating: 5.  A wardrobe must-have — though the price is a little steep for me.

High and mighty: Sarah Jessica Parker looks gorgeous with short hair and these fun wedge heels

The Inez, £146THE LOOK: Red suede espadrilles that make me feel like I’m wearing fancy dress. Stylish, chic, sexy . . . these shoes are none of those things. BEST FOR: Nothing. Even for wedges, these are painfully uncomfortable.WORST FOR: Comfort and style. They’re very narrow on the toe. Comfort rating: 2.  Not as painful as some, but for such relatively low heels at only three inches, they are awful.

Classic Carrie: Carrie, the character played by Sarah Jessica Parker in Sex and the City had a ridiculous amount of shoes - so many she needed a whole wardrobe to house them!

The Diana, £217THE LOOK: Very sexy black patent shoes, with a chic tapered heel.BEST FOR: Making short legs look lengthy. The slanted angle of the strap elongates the leg. WORST FOR: All-day wear. The super-shiny leather is a little bit stiff, and they’re easy enough to walk in at three-and-a-half inches — but I wouldn’t travel for miles in them. Comfort rating: 3. Great height, but that leather gives me blisters just by looking at it.

The Carrie, £212THE LOOK: A pointy nude T-bar sandal with a sky-high heel. BEST FOR: A night with minimal movement. Walking is nigh on impossible.WORST FOR: Anything that involves standing up too long. Comfort rating: 1. Murderously painful — but since when did that stop Carrie from stepping out in something so chic?

The Stella, £235THE LOOK: Clog sandals with four-inch heels and a wooden platform sole. BEST FOR: Walking, thanks to the platform heel. Perfect for a casual weekend or for someone who wants to add  height without reaching for the plasters. WORST FOR: Style. They’re just not glamorous enough for Carrie wannabes. Comfort rating: 4. But quite boring with it.

Ultra-feminine: Sarah Jessica Parker's pink shoes pick up hints of pink in her coat

The Etta, £270THE LOOK: Ultra-feminine, with a silk rose detail. While they’re only three-and-a-half inches high, they feel teeteringly uncomfortable, even by Carrie’s standards. I put this down to the thin sole. Oh, for a comfy platform sole!BEST FOR: Looking at. I can’t even wear them sitting down.WORST FOR: Getting blisters. The sharp toe means they pinch and rub like crazy. Comfort rating: 0. Rhino-hide feet only need apply.

Colour pop: Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie shows that a fantastic pair of shoes can make ANY outfit glam

The Lady, £209THE LOOK: As red as Dorothy’s ruby slippers in The Wizard Of Oz, these are super-sexy heels. I’m amazed by how comfortable they are, hugging my foot like a glove.And they might be three-and-a-half inches high, but the slightly sturdier heel makes them easier to balance in than other shoes in the range. BEST FOR:  Any occasion — as long as you can handle the attention!WORST FOR: Nothing. They’re a complete winner.Comfort rating: 5. Surprisingly blissful.
