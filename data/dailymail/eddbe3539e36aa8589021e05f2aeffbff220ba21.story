It was not the most discreet of entrances.

Two bungling robbers crashed a stolen tanker through a call centre's front door before using the vehicle to repeatedly ram a cash machine - before fleeing empty-handed.

Now George Nicol, 37, and David Fowler, 27,  have been sent to prison after they targeted banking firm HSBC in Blantyre, Lanarkshire, in October last year.

The High Court in Edinburgh heard that the pair stole the vehicle from a firm in East Kilbride, Lanarkshire, late on October 19 last year.

The court heard heard how Nicol drove the truck a few hours later to HSBC.

His side kick Fowler followed behind him in a Skoda Octavia which had false number plates and a sawn off shotgun and ammunition hidden in the boot.

The court heard how once the pair arrived at the premises, Nicol used the industrial vehicle to smash his way through the glass door.

In stunning footage that was played before Lord Glennie, people sitting in the court's public benches could see a glass door being smashed - and the frame being thrown several feet in the air.

The giant vehicle can then be seen skidding along the floor in the call centre's reception before Nicol aims it at a cash machine and hits the ATM.

He then reverses before propelling the tanker again for a second time - when repeated attempts fail, the pair then take turns to hit the cash machine with a sledge hammer before leaving the scene empty handed.

However, the court heard that the pair were arrested moments later after a high speed car chase through Lanarkshire. Police then found the sawn off shot gun and ammunition in their possession.

The court also heard that HSBC had to spend £197,298 to repair the damage caused in the raid.

The court heard that the owners of the sewage truck lost between £40,000 to £60,000 in business because of the theft of the sewage truck. It is estimated that it would cost £50,000 to replace the vehicle.

Nicol and Fowler pleaded guilty last month to theft, robbery and firearms charges.

Sentence had been deferred to Friday so that the court could obtain reports about their characters.

On Friday, Lord Glennie sentenced Nicol to five and a half years in prison - Fowler received a five year sentence.

Passing sentence, Lord Glennie branded the botched robbery 'bizarre.'

He added: 'You have both pleaded guilty to a bizarre attempt to rob money from a cash machine.

'The only saving grace in this case is that the crime was carried out in such an incompetent fashion.

'Offences of this nature require the imposition of significant periods of custody. You will both go to prison.'

The pair can then be seen on the CCTV footage speeding away, before police chased them and caught them.

Today Nicol's defence advocate Paul Nelson told the court that his client - who had owned a garage in Glasgow - had turned to crime because he had financial problems.

Mr Nelson added: 'The video footage shows the inept nature of the crime. It is a demonstrable fact that the person who committed the crime is monumentally stupid or desperate.

The pair pleaded guilty last month to theft, robbery and firearms charges. The judge said the crime was carried out 'in such an incompetent fashion'

'He is not stupid my lord. He was quite desperate. Prior to the crime he owned a garage business. He employed several people and made charitable donations.'

Mr Nelson said that Nicol's garage ran into financial problems because he sold partly worn tyres. In 2011, Glasgow City Council changed local laws with regard to businesses who sold partly worn tyres. Mr Nelson said that Nicol didn't comply with the law changes and that police raided his premises.

Mr Nelson added: 'The police came to his premises and seized £20,000 of stock. This placed him on a slippery slope. What happened with regard to his firm led him into entering into this enterprise.'

Fowler's solicitor advocate John Keenan told the court that his client also had financial difficulties at the time of the robbery.

He added: 'He had lost his job. At the time of the offence, he had learned his partner was pregnant and his was very worried about his ability to provide for their future.

'He fully appreciates that he is facing a lengthy custodial term. This has been brought into sharp focus by the fact that his partner is due to give birth in the next week and he won't be there to see the birth of his child or participate in its formative years.

'I would ask your lordship to take his guilty pleas into account and restrict his sentence.'

Lord Glennie said the only sentence available to him was to impose custodial terms.
