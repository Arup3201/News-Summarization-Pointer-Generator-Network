Shocking: Shannon Dodson, 42, has been arrested for allegedly drowning her son and setting his little body on fire

A 42-year-old woman who admitted to drowning her son before setting his body on fire just four days after threatening to take his life has been arrested.

Colorado's Shannon Dodson allegedly drowned  Jude Murray 
Gomez, five, in a bathtub last Friday, then put him on a bed and set the 
mattress on fire.

Firefighters found Jude 'wrapped in a [smoldering] 
blanket' and 'between a bed and a wall' at Dodson's Colorado Springs apartment.

Emergency crews found the woman, who had a history of homelessness, 'naked, wet and sitting up with her arms wrapped around her knees in a hall closet'.

They also found a bathtub full of water and half a bottle of sleeping pills in the kitchen of the East Pikes Peak Ave apartment.

A pill was also found in the bedroom with several burned matches.

Crews tried to resuscitate the little boy, but he died at the scene. 

When investigators interviewed Dodson at Memorial Hospital in Colorado Springs the next day, they asked her if she knew why they were there.

'Because I killed my son,' Dodson responded, according to KKTV.

The interviewing officer also wrote in the arrest affidavit: 'Ms. Dodson gave no further details of this incident, started to cry, and said that she shouldn't have done it and didn't know why she did it.

'Ms. Dodson also said she thought they would go together...that she couldn't believe she did it.'

Angel: Jude's family said in a statement he ' had a way of making the room brighten up when he walked in'

According to the arrest affidavit, one 
of Dodson's adult daughters told police that during a conversation four 
days before the fire, her mother said she wanted to kill Jude and then 
herself.

Her daughter said she spoke with her mother further about it, 
and her mother told her she wouldn't do it.

An aunt also told police that the
boy did not like to bathe at Dodson's home because 'she liked to dunk 
his head under the water.'

While police are still working to establish a motive in the killing, Denver Westword reported that Dodson was embroiled in a custody battle with Jude's father, Jude Thaddeus Gomez.

Gomez had filed for custody of his son last year.

Jude's grandmother, Jillian Gomez, had full custody of the boy at the time of his death. 

Dodson was allowed visitation rights three days a month, according to Denver Westword.

However, she violated the terms of 
the last get-together - which proved fatal for Jude - by failing to 
return the boy to his grandmother after three days.

When Dodson didn't show up to a prearranged handover time on November 3, Jillian contacted the Colorado Springs Police Department.

She said the cops said they couldn't get involved in a civil 
matter and referred her to the court system.

'It just seems like a nightmare,' she told Denver Westword. 'He was a dear little boy...and we miss him dearly.'

Jude's uncle, Juan Gomez, said this could have been avoided if authorities stepped in earlier.

'This was preventable on so many levels,' he stated before asking, 'Who dropped the ball?'

However Barbara Miller, a Colorado Springs Police Department spokeswoman, said a welfare check was done on November 3, according to Fox 21 News.

She said the report indicated officers were not able to make contact with Dodson or Jude, but did speak with a neighbor who told them they had seen the two earlier in the day and both appeared to be OK.

Court records indicate that Dodson had a history of homelessness.

A court-appointed guardian had also recommended an evaluation of the woman for 'possible mental health issues.'

On Wednesday, Westword published a statement from the little boy's relatives:

'There was something about that little boy that was so special. He touched everyone's heart that ever met him even if it was just a few minutes. He was a joy to be with and loved everyone,' it said.

'He had a way of making the room brighten up when he walked in. He was so polite and was so kind and smart beyond toddler years.'

Dodson is being held without bond in El Paso County jail.

She has been charged with first-degree murder.
