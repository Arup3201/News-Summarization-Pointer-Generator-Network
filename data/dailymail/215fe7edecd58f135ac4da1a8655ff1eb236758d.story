Tipping the scales at nearly 26 stone, IT teacher James Bentley wasn't setting a healthy example to pupils at his Oldbury school - and they weren't afraid to point it out.

Now James, 25, fed up with the teasing, has lost nearly half his bodyweight - an amazing 11 stone 3lbs - in just two years.

At his heaviest, James weighed 25 stone 11lb, had a massive 60in waist and was so large it took him 10 minutes to bend down and put his shoes on every morning.

Hefty: At his most well-padded, James tipped the scales at nearly 26 stone and had a colossal 60in waist

The 6ft 2in cycling fan now weighs 14st 8lbs and sports a trim 36in waist but says he has had to spend hundreds of pounds on a new wardrobe because he is swamped by his old super-sized clothes.

'I'm 6ft 2in which probably means I could get away with carrying a bit of extra weight, but now I feel much healthier,' said James

'When I put the weight on I was quite happy in myself and felt I didn't need to diet. I did get some comments from the pupils, nothing too bad but the word 'tubby' was used a few times.

'I took it in good humour because I have a good relationship with the students but things came to a head when I had my picture taken on sport's day.

'My body virtually filled the entire picture which was embarrassing and I knew I had to do something to change my appearance. I looked in the mirror and thought 'who is that person?'.

'I decided to lose weight over the summer holiday and just saw it as a short-term thing.'

Suits you sir! Thanks to the loss of nearly half his body weight, James now gets compliments from his pupils

Unusually, James had thought he had a healthy diet 
because he always skipped breakfast and lunch before binge-eating in 
the evenings.

'During the day I would just
have fizzy drinks, no food at all, but then at night I would have an 
Indian, Chinese, pizza or go to the chippy after marking the pupils 
work.

'Now I usually have porridge for breakfast, a chicken wrap for lunch and then a steak and jacket potato for dinner. I do still have treats like an Indian meal but I tend to go for a lighter option.'

But the real change came courtesy of a healthy new hobby: cycling.

'My friends suggested I start cycling and I just couldn't stop,' he explains. 'I was clocking up hundreds of miles a month and went as often as I could.

'I decided to carry on and the weight has managed to keep coming off and now I feel much better.

'When you are used to seeing yourself every day you don't notice the change but I do think it's ridiculous when I look at photos of myself from a few years ago, or I get my big trousers out.

Slim: James' healthy new diet and passion for cycling long distances has had impressive results

What's more, even James' pupils have noticed his rapidly dwindling waistline - and changed their tune to boot.

'The children at school tell me that they can see I'm losing weight - they think my face has changed quite a bit and people are always telling me I look younger,' their teacher adds.

'Now I weigh 14st 8lb and my goal is 13st 13lb so I haven't got too far to go.'

Teasing: Pupils at Oldbury Academy branded James 'tubby' but after his weight loss, he's had the last laugh

James and a group of fellow slimmers will cycle 136 miles from Whitehaven, Cumbria, to Tynemouth, Tyne and Wear, in April to raise money for the Rainbow Trust children's charity.
