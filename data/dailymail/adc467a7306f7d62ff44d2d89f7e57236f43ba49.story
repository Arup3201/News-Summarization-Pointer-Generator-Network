The funeral of a mother and her two young sons who are thought to have been stabbed to death by the boys' father took place today.

Through heavy rain and high winds, the coffins of Clair Smith, 36, Ben, nine, and Aaron, one, were brought to Rawdon Crematorium in Leeds in two hearses.

Clair's husband, Richard, 37, is believed to have attacked his family at their home in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, before setting light to the main bedroom a day later and killing himself by smoke inhalation. He was not cremated with his family.

The first black hearse held a traditional wooden coffin for Clair, followed by the second which contained two small white coffins, a tiny one for baby Aaron and a bigger one for Ben on top of which was a football made of flowers in tribute to the soccer-mad youngster.

The cars slowly pulled down a winding drive to the crematorium, surrounded by a heavy woodland, for a private gathering to pay tribute to the tragic family.

After the hour-long service, mourners young and old, dressed in black and wrapped up to brave the windy day, left the crematorium, many arm-in-arm to support each other.

A murder inquiry was launched last month after police said the family were found dead together on a double bed in the fire-damaged main bedroom of their home in Sheridan Way, Pudsey, on Sunday, December 11.

Leeds Coroner David Hinchliff 
confirmed that Aaron had died from a stab wound to the neck, which 
severed his carotid artery and jugular vein.

Mr
Hinchliff said Ben died from suffocation due to the obstruction of his 
airway and smoke inhalation, while police said he had also been stabbed.

Mrs
Smith died from a stab wound to the chest and 'external compression to 
the neck' and the coroner said Mr Smith died from smoke inhalation.

Detective
Superintendent Paul Taylor, of West Yorkshire Police, said Ben's 
unopened advent calendar was one clue to when the killings happened.

He
said the family was last seen at 11pm on the Friday night, when they 
left a function at Pudsey St Lawrence Cricket Club by taxi.

Police
were talking to people who were at the cricket club party, but 
confirmed there had been no reports of any unusual incidents at the 
function, Mr Taylor said.

The
family was found dead after concerned neighbours called at the house on
the Sunday afternoon, followed soon afterwards by police officers.

Mrs
Smith's parents, Alan and Norma Robinson, released a statement about 
their daughter which said: 'Clair was an exceptional person, loving and 
caring to everyone.

'She was a loving mum, her children were her life, 
and everything centred around her family and home.

'She was our daughter and our best pal. We cannot imagine what caused this tragedy.'

After the deaths were discovered, relatives described the Smiths as a 'perfect family'.

Friends
said Mr Smith worked for a shopfitting firm as a designer and was a 
coach for a local football club.

They said the family appeared to have 
no problems and could not understand what had happened.
