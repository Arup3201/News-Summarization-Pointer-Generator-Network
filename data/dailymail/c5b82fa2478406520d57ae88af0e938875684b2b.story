A 19-year-old girl has died after her brother's friend threw a lit sparkler into her room as a prank.

Kristen Milano was sleeping in her family's apartment in Southington, Connecticut on Sunday when Eric Morelli, 18, allegedly tossed the lit firework through an open window.

The sparkler, which Morelli had hoped would wake up his friend, set off a fire that engulfed the apartment. Milano died of smoke inhalation.

Southington police arrested 
Morelli on Tuesday and charged him with manslaughter.

Tragic: Kristen Milano, left, died in a house fire on Sunday after her brother's friend Eric Morelli, right, allegedly threw a lit sparkler through a window as a prank. He now faces manslaughter charges

Milano's friends said that Morelli had jumped on his moped and rode to the Summer Brook Apartments 
early on Sunday morning and threw in the sparkler to get the attention of the brother.

'He thought it was a good idea to throw a
 firework up there, trying to be funny, trying to wake him up,' Kyle Cima-Yannell, Milano's friend, told WFSB.

Milano's brother was actually downstairs sleeping at the time.

Friends said the family thought Milano still was out and as they watched their home burn, they thought they were lucky to survive - until emergency responders told them she had been found.

Neighbors said they were only 'semi shocked' that Morelli had been involved as he did often not think things through.

Scene: Family members did not know Milano was home when the sparkler started a fire on Sunday and only learned that she had been inside when emergency responders said she had been found

Killed: 19-year-old Milano, a radiology student, died from smoke inhalation, authorities said

'He just goes off and does what he wants to do at that time,' Brian Goralnik, a neighbor who grew up with Morelli, told WFSB.

'At
 some point, you would think that maybe he'd find the right light, the 
right way, and he just couldn't find that.'

Another neighbor, Linda Selander, told WTNH that she was 'semi shocked' to learn that Morelli was allegedly involved. She explained that the teenager crashed his mother’s truck in her yard last year.

'All I wanted was for him to come over and apologize and say "hey I didn’t mean to do it" and he didn't,' she said.

Morelli paid bond and left jail on Tuesday night. He has been charged with manslaughter and three counts of reckless endangerment.

Arrest: Morelli was arrested at his home, pictured, on Tuesday - and neighbors and friends said they were only 'semi shocked' because the boy often played pranks without thinking

His attorney released a statement saying Morelli and his family 'are extremely sorry over what has 
happened'.

'This is particularly difficult as Eric was a long-time friend 
of Kristen,' it read. 'Eric never intended to harm anyone and he is very remorseful
 about this tragedy. He has been fully cooperative with law enforcement 
and will be responding to the charges in court.'

Milano's funeral will be held on Friday.

An obituary posted online said she was attending Middlesex Community College to achieve her dream of becoming a 
Radiologist.

'Friends and family knew her as free spirited girl who had 
the special gift of instantly making you feel special and putting a 
smile on your face,' it said.
