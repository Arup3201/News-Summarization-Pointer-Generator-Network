Alex Salmond said the poll tax was dead so outstanding debts should be written off

Alex Salmond yesterday wrote off more than £400million in unpaid poll tax payments in a final act of ‘financial irresponsibility’.

The First Minister’s ‘tax-dodger’s charter’ stunned local authority chiefs, who want to chase up the debts and spend the cash on vital services.

Critics fear the amnesty is a cynical bid to appease pro-independence voters who risk being caught by the authorities after registering to vote for the first time in the referendum.

With an additional £1billion outstanding in council tax payments, Mr Salmond’s shock decision – one of the last before he resigns next month - could create a precedent that would leave public finances in chaos. 

It will also infuriate law-abiding Scots who paid their poll tax payments, despite the policy’s widespread unpopularity.

At a baffling briefing session with journalists yesterday afternoon, Mr Salmond’s spokesman said Margaret Thatcher’s community charge – as it was officially known – was ‘dead’ so the debts should now be ignored.

He argued that sums recouped in recent years have fallen to just £400,000, but council chiefs wanted to improve on that by combing the new electoral roll to catch those who had dropped off the radar. 

The historic vote on Scotland's future saw a surge in registrations, with 120,000 in the final six weeks alone, as people formed unprecedented queues outside town halls.

According to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (CoSLA), Scots still owe £425million in unpaid poll tax bills.

The Scottish Daily Mail understands that councils may be handed a small one-off £350,000 compensation sum – less than 0.1 per cent of the outstanding total.

The organisation’s furious president, David O’Neill, said: ‘Whatever you think of the substantive issue… this is one of the oddest decisions ever to have come out of the Scottish Government.

‘Just look at the hard facts. Up until two days ago the policy of local government, fully backed up by Audit Scotland reports and the Scottish Government, was crystal clear: Scotland’s councils were under a very strict obligation to collect every penny of outstanding debt owed to us.

‘Indeed, we have been told in the past that until we did this, we should not be asking for any additional money from Government.

‘It seems very odd that now we have an improved tool at our disposal in the form of an expanded electoral register that may help us maximise collection rates, it is the self-same government that tells us they are going to legislate immediately to prevent us from using it.’

He accused the government of ‘rushing with obscene haste to new legislation’, adding: ‘CoSLA is very sensitive to the requirement to increase political engagement and electoral registration but everybody recognises that becoming involved in the political process demands responsibility as well as rights.

‘In CoSLA’s view, you cannot have one without the other. If that is not an accepted principle, we are very worried about the precedent that writing off this debt would create.’

The ‘community charge’ was introduced a year early north of the Border, sparking widespread opposition and an organised campaign of non-payment in 1989.

Around 700,000 summary warrants for non-payment were issued after the first year, but Margaret Thatcher refused to change course and the tax was introduced in England in 1990.

Disgraced former MSP Tommy Sheridan was the first person in Britain to be jailed over the tax, while a series of protests brought about the policy’s end in 1993.

Mr Salmond said yesterday: ‘The poll tax was a hated levy, which poured untold misery on communities across Scotland.

‘It was a hugely discredited tax, even before it was brought in – and it was rightly consigned to history just four years after its introduction in Scotland.

‘It is therefore not appropriate for councils to use current electoral records to chase arrears from decades ago.’

He added: ‘It is, of course, quite proper for councils to use current information to assess current council tax liability. Unlike the long dead, discredited poll tax, the council tax is a live levy which forms a key part of local authorities’ finances.’

His spokesman was asked what will happen to outstanding council tax payments if the tax is abolished under SNP proposals for a ‘local income tax’.

Struggling to answer, he said there will be a consultation on the suggested local income tax.

Scottish Conservative welfare reform spokesman Alex Johnstone said: ‘This can only count as a write-off if all councils are fully reimbursed for the money they have not yet received.

‘There is many a person in Scotland who paid this tax in good faith, and they have ended up subsidising those who can afford to pay but chose not to. Are those hardworking people going to be reimbursed too under this initiative?

‘If this is the Scottish Government’s approach on tax collection, why should anyone bother paying any tax at all?

‘This is a move geared towards winning a few extra votes, and is nothing but a tax-dodger’s charter and a final act of financial irresponsibility from Alex Salmond.’
