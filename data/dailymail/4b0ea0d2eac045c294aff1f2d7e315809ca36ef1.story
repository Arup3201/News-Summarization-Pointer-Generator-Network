A federal judge has found author and 
infomercial pitchman Kevin Trudeau in contempt of court for failing to 
pay a more than $37 million fine imposed over misleading ads for one of 
his wildly popular weight-loss books.

The
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been after 50-year-old Trudeau, 
originally from Massachusetts, for several years after he made millions flogging what he claims are natural cures for serious and potentially fatal illnesses.

The
ruling at the end of last month was the latest round in more than a 
decade of legal battles that began with a suit filed by the Federal 
Trade Commission.

Failure: Infomercial king Kevin Trudeau has been held in contempt of court for failing to pay $38million for defrauding customers with his natural cures

Trudeau was slapped with a $38 million fine in 2011 after allegedly scamming customers for decades.  

The FTC said that he has made millions of dollars by telling followers that coral calcium can cure cancer among other claims. 

FTC put the value at $37.6million as to 
how much consumers were defrauded by 'deceptive infomercials' that 
Trudeau filmed in order to plug his book - The Weight Loss Cure 'They' 
Don't Want You to Know About.

In 2007, Judge Robert Gettleman fined Trudeau $37.6 million for violating the order. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's decision that Trudeau must pay the huge fine.

On July 26 of this year, Gettleman said Trudeau failed to pay and ordered him to transfer ownership of companies and financial accounts to a court-appointed receiver.

Gettleman found him in contempt, opting not to give him jail time out of concern that those hurt by his actions would never get compensated.

Best-seller: Millions of people bought Trudeau's book which claimed that calcium could cure cancer and a product called Biotape would relieve severe pain

He likened Trudeau to a puppet master in control of a vast network being used to keep his assets hidden and suggested that without his cooperation there would be no way to get at that money.

Despite no formal medical training and several criminal convictions, Trudeau has sold millions of books offering cures for dozens of ailments, from faltering memory to hair loss.

Kevin Trudeau made late-night infomercials for more that 20 years.

Doctors have expressed concern in the past about his book Natural Cures They Don't Want You To Know About which has sold more than five million copies and appeared at the top of non-fiction bestseller lists.

His claims include: 'The sun does not cause cancer. Sun block has been shown to cause cancer.'

Another one of his statements is that Aids is 'one of the greatest hoaxes and deceptions ever perpetrated on the American public'.

The FTC first came after Trudeau in 1998 for making false claims on TV.

He claimed his alternative medicines could cause dramatic weight loss and cure addictions to alcohol, cigarettes and heroin.

He even said the herbal remedies could give users a photographic memory.

More than 25 million Americans have purchased products from Trudeau.

On one episode of his radio show The Kevin Trudeau Show, he said: 'Coral calcium is the best form of calcium.'

He then tells his listeners: 'Every single one of you are deficient in vitamin D3 and calcium.

'If you take those two things, it's virtually impossible to get cancer and it's impossible to get sick.'

They have titles such as The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About, the book at the center of his latest legal trouble.

The FTC first sued Trudeau in 1998, charging that he made false and unsubstantiated claims in infomercials for hair growth, memory and weight-loss products.

In 2003, the agency sued Trudeau for deceptively marketing a calcium product as a cancer cure and a product called Biotape as a pain reliever.

Trudeau paid $2 million in 2004 to settle the FTC's charges and agreed to comply with a court order banning him from infomercials except those that accurately promote books.

Three years later, the judge held Trudeau in civil contempt for misrepresenting some of the facts in an ad for his best-selling weight-loss book, namely that the diet plan was easy and allowed adherents to eat anything they wanted.

After purchasing the book, however, the FTC alleged that consumers discover it 'requires severe dieting,' daily injections of a prescription drug not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for weight loss and 'lifelong dietary restrictions'.

Trudeau's attorney, Kimball Anderson, said last month that his client wants to cooperate but does not own the companies and does not have the money.
