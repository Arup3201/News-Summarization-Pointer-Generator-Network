Animal rescue workers are seeking the owner of this dog - which was found abandoned in a tent at Glastonbury Festival.

The lurcher was found cowering in one of the 5,000 discarded tents during the clean-up of the 1200-acre festival site at Worthy Farm, Somerset.

The beautiful white dog was renamed 'Dolly' by officials in tribute to festival hit Dolly Parton.

Loveable: Rescue workers say that they are now looking for the owners of the dog, which they describe as 'sweet natured and older'. They say that the animal has been left stressed by her situation

Abandoned: The white lurcher was found in one of the 5,000 tents that were left discarded in the fields of Worthy Farm, Somerset after the festival. A crew of up to 800 were responsible for tidying up the camp site

Discarded: Dolly was found in a tent on Tuesday as the cleaning crew began transforming the site back to a working dairy farm. The process, which involves litter pickers, tractors and volunteers, could take six weeks

Dolly the dog is now recovering at the Happy Landings animal shelter in Pylle, Somerset and rescue workers are looking for answers.

A spokesperson said: 'How anyone could do such a thing is beyond me.

'She is a sweet-natured older lurcher, and clearly very stressed to find herself in this predicament.

'We had hoped that an owner would come forward but there has still been nothing.'

Dolly was found in one of the open camping fields as the clean-up operation got underway on Tuesday.

Appeal: Rescue workers said that they had hoped Dolly's owners would have come forward, but there has been no information so far

Namesake: The lonely dog was renamed Dolly after Glastonbury hit Dolly Parton who performed on the Pyramid stage on day three of the festival. Some 80,000 revellers crowded around  to watch the 68-year-old singer

Crowded: For five days the 1200-acre festival site was home to some 175,000 people. Tractors carrying magnetic strip were dispatched to pick up tent pegs left at the festival site

Recovery: Dolly, pictured with a rescue worker, is now being looked after at Happy Landings animal shelter. A spokesperson from Glastonbury declined to comment but said that pets were not welcome at the festival

Over five days last week it was home 
to some 175,000 people, who attended performances by world-class acts 
such as Metallica, Arcade Fire and Kasabian.

And some 80,000 revellers crowded around the 
stage to watch Dolly the dog's country music singing namesake bring the festival to a 
close on its third day of music.

Campers had until 6pm on Monday to leave the site while crew and stall holders are given a week to clear their property.

A
 team of around 800 workers have started the mammoth task of clearing an
 estimated 11 tonnes of clothes and camping gear which were abandoned at
 the site, while volunteers began sifting through recycling yesterday.

Tractors carrying magnetic strips will travel across the 1,200-acre site to pick up tent pegs.

Meanwhile workers will carry out a fingertip search to make sure no inch of the land goes unchecked.

The mission toÂ  convert the land back to a working dairy farm could take up to six weeks.

A spokesman for the festival declined to comment but said pets were not welcome at Glastonbury.
