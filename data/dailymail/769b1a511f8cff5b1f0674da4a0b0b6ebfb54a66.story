Russian 'lesbian couple' Irina Shumilova and Alyona Fursova have spoken out about their unique 'same sex' marriage in a country that bans such unions.

They were allowed to go ahead because Irina was born a man.

Asked why they wed, Irina said: 'In fact it is very simple. Why do people get married?'

'To express their feelings, it's natural. Secondly, marriage gives certain guarantees. If something bad happens to me or with Alena, we are relatives, we can come to hospital and so on. 

'But the main reason - feelings of course.'

She added: 'Legally we have everything in order, it is all within the law. And from a legal point of view, we are heterosexual couple, but de jure and de facto may slightly differ in real life.'

Alena said that if Irina, 24, re-registers herself as a woman after a sex change their union could become 'null and void'.

'We can lose the rights that heterosexual couples have. So we decided to use this opportunity to get married, at least now, when we can do this.'

Irina denied she intended to campaign for same sex marriages.

'I'm not an activist. Seriously, I am not interested in this,' she said.

Critic Vitaly Milonov - a St Petersburg MP and staunch opponent of gay rights - has demanded that their marriage should be declared illegal.

'If to comment on the words of Milonov, that we are mentally ill or something - we are not mentally ill, homosexuality was removed from the banned list a long time ago. 

'Our marriage is correct from legal point of view, so he will fail to dissolve it,' said Irina.

She was 'tired' of the media circus around their wedding but added: 'We would like that in our country there was a legal way, like a partnership, when two people who are dear to each other can legally be together'.

Alena said: 'The way it happened, it happened. I'm glad that media were able to cover it and to focus on the problems which face LGBT people.'

Irina said she does intend to change her registration to be a woman. 

'I will change my gender in not less than two years. I am going to change my passport. But what the legal consequences of this will be, I do not know, and have never thought about it.'

The couple married at a registry office in St Petersburg, with both choosing to wear traditional white wedding dresses for the day.

Their situation was explained by LGBT rights activist Anna Anisimova: 'The official registration by two women happened because one of them is a man according to the documents,' she said.

'Formally it was a wedding between a man and a woman but de-facto it was between two women. It was the first (LGBT wedding) in Russia. Both brides wore white dresses.'

Following their nuptials Irina and Alyona were given a legal marriage certificate. 

Irina is currently undergoing hormone therapy and wears a blonde wig and make-up at all times.

St Petersburg MP Vitaly Milonov said he will investigate the validity of their marriage claimed the workers at the registry office should not just have checked their sex on their passports.

Milonov reportedly told the Russian media, 'I understood their [registry office workers'] unconvincing arguments; they formally approached the issue and saw passports, but not people. I told the head [of the wedding registry office] that it is criminal negligence.'

He went on to say the wedding was, 'an ugly insult to millions of Russian families in the future... There are certain moral standards which it is vital to implement. These mad people should be banned altogether from getting married.'

Gay marriage has only recently been legalised in the UK.

The legislation to allow same-sex marriage was passed in July 2013 and came into effect in March 2014.

The first official gay marriage took place on the 29th of March 2014. 

Prior to this same-sex couples who wished to solidify their union would have to enter into a civil partnership. 

This gave them the same rights as married couples however they were not allowed to refer to themselves as 'married.' 

Russia is known for its discrimination against those in the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community. Until 1999 homosexuality was referred to as a mental illness.

And although sexual activity between same-sex consenting adults in private has not been a criminal offence since 1993 there are still strict rules over the propagation of gay rights propaganda.

Indeed, in 2013 a law was put in place banning the distribution of materials promoting the LGBT community to young children.

And earlier this year a shocking documentary named Hunted highlighted the plight of gay people in Russia. 

Although many see Irina and Alyona's marriage as a step forward for the country and the first of its kind gay rights activist Nikolay Alekseev disagrees.

He told Russian TV show Russia Today that he does not believe their wedding should be counted as a same sex marriage.

He said: 'This is in no way a same-sex marriage. This is a question of transgender, not homosexuality.

'This is an old story, there have been such cases before. A certain gender is written in a passport, but how they dress for the wedding is their business.'
