David Cameron was yesterday urged in the Commons to finally end Gary McKinnon’s decade of suffering and give the Asperger’s sufferer ‘his life back’.

The Prime Minister came under pressure to deliver on his promise to show ‘compassion’ towards Mr McKinnon, whom the Americans accuse of hacking into military computers.

In Opposition, both Mr Cameron and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg promised to help Mr McKinnon, who judges and doctors say could take his own life if extradited.

But, two years after the Coalition came to power, he remains in limbo - waiting to see if he will be bundled on a plane to the US, where he faces spending a decade or more behind bars

Mr McKinnon, now 46, was first arrested on charges of hacking into NASA and Pentagon computers from his north London home on March 9, 2002 - meaning he has already spent ten years living in constant fear.

Yesterday, at Prime Minister’s Questions, his plight was again raised by the campaigning Tory MP David Burrowes.

Mr Burrowes said: ‘The Prime Minister has called for compassion for my constituent Gary McKinnon, who doctors report is likely to take his life if he is extradited.

‘The Deputy Prime Minister has also said that it would be cruel if he were to be extradited.

‘So can the government be true to its word and stop the extradition and finally after ten years give Gary McKinnon his life back?’

Mr Cameron replied that the Home Secretary, Theresa May, was currently considering new medical evidence about the hacker and would reach a decision soon.

Judges have said that, under the very strict terms of the UK/U.S extradition deal, it would not be a breach of Mr McKinnon’s rights to bundle him on a plane.

But his supporters say that the risk 
of suicide - which has been acknowledged by the courts - should be 
sufficient grounds for Mrs May to intervene.

A
string of Labour Home Secretaries approved Mr McKinnon’s extradition - 
severely limiting the options still left open to Mrs May.

She
has been studying the medical reports for a number of months, with the 
courts pressing for a decision in the case before the end of July.

Mrs
McKinnon’s mum, Janis Sharp, says consultant forensic psychiatrist Jan 
Vermeulen, who is a Home Office approved expert, considered her son 
‘unfit for trial’ and at extreme risk of suicide in April 2012.

His report, which has been sent to Mrs May, concluded: ‘If he survives the transit to the USA, he will be so traumatised that he may remain unfit to plead for a considerable period.

Nick Clegg, pictured with Mrs Sharp outside the Home Office in 2009, has also pledged his support to Mr McKinnon in the past

‘I strongly recommend that once Mr McKinnon has recovered from his current ordeal his trial takes place in the U.K.’

The Mail has been campaigning for the past three years to halt Mr McKinnon’s extradition to the U.S.

He has also been backed by a string of MPs, mental health charities and celebrities, who all argue that he should stand trial in the UK.

His alleged crimes were committed from the bedroom of his north London flat. He hacked into both NASA and Pentagon computers while looking for evidence of the existence of ‘little green men’.

Mr McKinnon’s case sparked huge concern over the U.K/US Extradition Act, which opponents argue is lopsided.

MPs have demanded a change in the law so that, in future, Britons will be placed on trial in the UK if that is where the bulk of their offending took place.

Mrs May is separately considering a report into where there needs to be significant changes to the extradition treaty, which was signed by Labour in 2003.
