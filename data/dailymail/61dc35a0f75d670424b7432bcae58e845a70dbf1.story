The federal government drew up plans to detonate 23 nuclear bombs in a California mountain range to blast over a passage for a new railroad and highway, it has been revealed.

The scheme, which was deemed 'safe' by scientists at the time, is one of more than two-dozen ideas dreamed up at the height of the atomic age for Operation Plowshares - a bid to harness the devastating power of nuclear weapons for civilian use.

Other  ideas included using five bombs to dig out a harbor on Alaska's North Slope, digging an alternative to the Panama Canal across Nicaragua and using underground blasting to unleash the oil from the tar sands in Canada. 

During this time, engineers were testing the limits of nuclear propulsion -  drawing up plans for nuclear yachts and ferries, nuclear-powered rocket ships, nuclear powered planes and Ford even designed a prototype for a car - the Nucleon - with an atomic reactor.

The plan called for 50 kilotons of nuclear bombs to blow out 68million cubic yards of rock and debris from a mountain pass in the Mojave Desert in California

'The friendly atom': A 1962 test in Nevada blasted a 320-foot-deep crater in the Earth. Plumes from the blast exposed thousands of people to radiation

The map shows that few people lived with a 50-mile radius of the proposed blast site. Experts predicted it would have little effect on people on the environment

Project Carryall intended to blow open the mountains to make room for a new highway and rail line through the southern Mojave desert. Route 66 and the parallel train line had to run several miles of the way to get around the steep mountains. 

The operation would have saved the federal government $8million over the cost of conventional blasting through the Bristol Mountains in the Mojave Desert, the Atomic Energy Commission estimated in 1963, according to Gizmodo. 

The plan called for 22 nuclear bombs to be detonated deep in the mountain to blast a 500-foot deep chasm. The final fission explosive would have been used to create a crater for drainage. 

'The study group has concluded that this project is technically feasible. It can be done, and it can be done safely,' California highway engineers wrote in a report. 

The blasts would have excavated 68million cubic yards of rock and gravel. 

The atomic age caused America to dream of world without internal combustion engines or fuel. Engineers designed small ships, airplanes and even rocket ships with nuclear reactors - though few came to reality. Ford even fleshed out a prototype Ford Nucleon fission-powered car equipped with its own nuclear reactor. 

One project that did come to fruition - the NS Savannah, a 600-foot cargo ship and cruiseliner - was built in 1959 to show off the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Barely bigger than some modern day super yachts, the ship was dramatically smaller than nuclear-powered warships of the day. 

The Convair NB-36H flew several dozen flights with a nuclear reactor, but the program was scrapped

The NS Savannah was the world's first civilian nuclear-powered ship. At less than 600 feet long, it was barely bigger than some modern super yachts

End the end, however, the Savannah proved too costly to operate for commercial purposes. 

Both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. built nuclear-power long-range bombers in the 1950s and early 60s, as well. Both the Soviet Tupolev Tu-95LAL and the Convair NB-36H flew dozens of test flights with a reactor in place - though they never ran on nuclear propulsion. 

Cost, safety and environmental concerns led to both the Soviets and the Americans the cancel the programs. 

Ford built a scale model of a Neutrino - a fanciful concept car that would have run on a nuclear reactor and a steam turbine

Project Carryall was actually deemed safe by engineers in the day - though thankfully it was never tested

The mountains in California were too high to build roads or rails across - so either a tunnel or a passage way had to be blasted out

 

Cutting through the mountain: Project Carryall was meant to allow a highway to pass through the mountains - rather than around them, like Route 66 was forced to do. Modern day I-40 passes near the planned route

The study - and all other Plowshares projects - come around when Americans were still enamored by the potential of nuclear explosions. Disasters and near disasters that have shaped the modern fear of nuclear power had not yet happened. The partial nuclear reactor meltdown at Three Mile Island took place in 1979. The Chernobyl disaster was not until 1989. 

The 1962 Sedan nuclear test in Nevada exposed the dangers of using nuclear weapons for engineering when a radiation plume contaminated people as far away as Iowa - exposing the risks of detonating nuclear weapons.

The Carryall project was shelved and eventually engineers used conventional explosives to blast through the Bristol Mountains to build Interstate 40.  

Project Pan-Atomic Canal would have blasted a new trans-ocean canal across Nicaragua

 Operation Plowshares spent nearly a quarter billion dollars researching civilian uses for nuclear weapons between 1959 and 1971. The project carried out 27 nuclear tests during that time.

Here are some of the more outlandish plans from Operation Plowshares:
