A TV reporter in Colorado has been hospitalized with frostbite to his fingers after trying to film a late-night live shot during freezing temperatures.

Eric Fink, a reporter for KRDO in Colorado Springs, was wearing cold-weather clothing while preparing to film a live shot on his own on Saturday night but ran into difficulties with his equipment.

He told his producers that he needed to remove his gloves in order to connect his camera to the backpack, but that he was worried about taking them off in freezing winds, Mediabistro reported.

But he removed them - as temperatures plunged to 11F (-11.7C) with a wind chill of 3F (-16C).

The station would not comment on whether Fink was reporting on the weather at the time or on a different local story.

Another KRDO reporter tweeted a photograph showing Fink receiving treatment for several frostbitten fingers on Sunday.

'How cold is it? Reporter @E_FINKSTER has frostbite on both hands after working in Falcon,' reported Jonathan Petramala tweeted.

On Wednesday, Fink, 27, took to his own Twitter feed to give followers an update.

'Recovering from frostbite,' he wrote. 'I am overwhelmed by the prayers and support. Tweeting a heartfelt thank you to everybody.'

Ahead of the incident, KRDO had been warning viewers to bundle up against the sub-zero temperatures, warning them of the risks of frostbite.

Mediabistro reported that the station's journalists had criticized KRDO for a lack of weather safety training. 

'No one was surprised that something bad was going to happen during spot news or weather, we'd just hoped it wouldn't lead to someone potentially losing fingers as a result,' an insider told the site.

Staff from KRDO declined to comment on the incident.

Temperatures plunged in Colorado on Saturday during a cold front that lumbered across the U.S., and the temperature in Colorado Springs dropped from 30F to 20F in just one hour that afternoon. 

Freezing: The channel has been warning viewers about the freezing temperatures across Colorado Springs. It was 11F (-11.7C) with wind chills when Fink tried to film his shot on Saturday night

Frostbite happens when skin is exposed to freezing temperatures – typically any temperature below 31ºF. It can affect any part of your body, but hands, feet, ears, nose and lips, are most likely to be affected. To avoid frostbite:

The very young and very old are most at risk of frostbite as their bodies are less able to regulate body temperature. Smokers and diabetics are also at risk.

During cold weather alcohol can be a factor in frost bite - it causes you to lose heat at a faster rate.

The symptoms of frostbite usually begin with the affected parts feeling cold and painful. If exposure to the cold continues, you may feel pins and needles.

If the tingling in the fingers and toes doesn't stop, or there are at least 30 minutes of symptoms and no feeling in the extremities, you should seek medical attention.
