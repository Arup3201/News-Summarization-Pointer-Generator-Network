Controversial NBA owner Donald Sterling has added yet another feather to his already crowded real estate mogul cap with a six bedroom Beverly Hills home.

Even as the storm around his leaked racist remarks continues to rage amid the possibility he'll be forced to sell the LA Clippers, the 80-year-old billionaire purchased his 165th property on May 12.

The 5,310-square-foot Spanish-style home cost him a reported $5,162,750.

According to Trulia, the home was purchased under the 'Sterling Family Trust' earlier this month with Donald Sterling as trustee.

Listing photos attest to the outdated decorating in the home, which hasn't been listed in decades.

But the home is still impressive.

It features 5.25 baths, a maid's quarters and even an inner courtyard.

Sterling first started investing in real estate back in 1961 while still an attorney.

His first purchased was a 26-unit apartment building and his purchasing power only took off from there.

By April 2014, Curbed put the number of properties he owned at 162. Now, it's 163.

Meanwhile, TMZ has reported that Sterling's estranged wife Shelly--to whome Sterling has turned over the estimated $1.5 billion team--is looking to unload the Clippers as soon as this week.
