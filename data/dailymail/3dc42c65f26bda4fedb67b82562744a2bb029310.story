After finishing nine seasons with the NFL some might expect Terry Tautolo to be living the high life.

Few might expect the 58-year-old to instead be living beneath a Los Angeles freeway, homeless, while feared to be suffering a lasting affect by the professional sport: Brain damage.

Today the former linebacker for the Philadelphia Eagles, San Francisco 49ers, Detroit Lions and Miami Dolphins appears frail though as his former 49ers roommate George Visger says, still 'very proud.'

Scroll down for video

New life: Former NFL linebacker Terry Tautolo, 58, is seen near an overpass in Los Angeles, a site he says he frequented after a concussion sustained in a game led to his removal from the sport

Heavy hitter: Seen left running against the New York Giants as #50 of the San Francisco 49ers, Tautolo was a star in the 1980s up until his injury which he said he never reported to the NFL

'You look at him and, the teeth missing, the eyes sunken in, but you ask him, and, "Oh, I don’t have any issues," Mr Visger told CBS Sacramento.

Mr Visger, who played alongside Mr Tautolo until his own career was ended early due to a series of concussions, successfully sued the NFL for workers compensation after a gruelling battle.

He has had nine brain surgeries since, pointing to a hidden tube running through the side of his head to a pump in one instance, and says he could require more.

'None of us want to ask for help, but there’s some things that he’s earned,' Mr Visger said of his old friend whom he's since encouraged to be tested for similar injuries.

Mr Tautolo however has acknowledged that a similar blow to his own head, making him what he called ‘a paper head,’ is what ended his career.

He says he never reported the injury to the NFL, though it was enough to make him quit, fearing he could end up paralyzed if hit just one more time.

Momentos: In his daughter's home photos of the father and twice married husband are seen with his children as well as a team photo of his days with the 49ers

Full responsibility: He admits his concussion causing him to quit the NFL, fearing he could become paralyzed if hit just one more time, but refuses to blame the sport on his life's troubles

Since ending his NFL career in the 1980, Mr Tautolo has run through two failed marriages, suffers anger problems he’s seen counselling for and has been in and out of homelessness.

They're all clear signs of brain damage according to doctors.

'I had stayed with friends now and then but I didn't want to burden them,' he told CBS of his decision to move beneath the overpass.

When asked how others living beneath there reacted to hearing that he was once a NFL star, he interrupts to say: 'Oh, I didn't tell them.'

Reaching out: Mr Tautolo's former 49ers roommate George Visger has undergone nine brain surgeries since his own leave from the NFL prompting him to motivate his old friend to see a doctor

Repercussions: Mr Visger successfully sued the NFL for workers compensation after his injuries that in one surgery required a tube, he gestures on his head's right side, to be inserted along with a pump

His physical injuries are a bit different, though ones he mutually tries to get by with.

Holding out his hands, his fingers are permanently bent, unable to stretch them out straight.

He admits to having exited games and taping them up himself, not seeking medical treatment like most players more readily see today.

'Getting old, things are breaking down, but it’s all due to me, you know,' he said. 'Maybe it speeded up because of football.'

In a rare moment revealing his vulnerability, standing beside that overpass he asks the CBS reporter quizzically: 'Do you think something's wrong with me?'

Warped: Among Mr Tautolo's other injuries, his hands are visibly skewed after merely wrapping his fingers in tape after games rather than his injuries addressed by doctors

Price to pay: After visiting a doctor with Mr Visger, Mr Tautolo, seen center during his NFL hay-day, says he hasn't ruled out having a full assessment done but he's still not sure it'd be worth the financial burden

That little bit of doubt is what led him to a doctor at Mr Visger's imploring side.

'Any concerns at all about how you feel or how you function,' Dr Daniel Amen asks him with the CBS reporter in the room.

'Ah, no. Nope,' Mr Tautolo quietly replies.

He didn't open up to the doctors that day but since leaving the office he has told CBS he hasn't ruled out the possibility of having a full assessment.

It just requires money he doesn't have, he said, as well as a continuing push.

But perhaps one day, he said.
