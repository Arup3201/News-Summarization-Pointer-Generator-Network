Swansea City completed the signing of Tottenham full back Kyle Naughton on a three-and-a-half-year contract on Thursday.

The 26-year-old passed a medical and agreed personal terms in south Wales on Wednesday, before the club announced the deal on Thursday afternoon. The transfer fee for the right back was marginally under £5million.

Naughton told Swansea's official website: 'I'm pleased it's all done because there has been talk since the summer over a potential move.

'My main aim is to start playing regular football again. I know it's going to be a tough challenge because there are some very good players here, but that's my goal.

'I've had quite a few loan moves over my career, but I actually played 34 games last season for Spurs, which is a fair amount. The main problem for me, however, was that I was still in and out of the team. That's difficult at times.

'I'm sad to be leaving Spurs because it's a great club. I was there quite a while and the lads are a great bunch. But now I just want to settle into life at Swansea and try to play regularly. It all comes down to playing football – after all, that's my job.'

Swansea could yet do more business with Spurs in this window, having been quoted £5m for Tom Carroll, who is on loan at the Liberty Stadium.

Having signed promising central midfielder Matt Grimes from Exeter, Garry Monk is weighing up whether to move for a player who occupies the same position.

Naughton played in only five games for Mauricio Pochettino this season and was told he was no longer needed.

Monk has been won over by his ability to play on either side of defence, with Swansea keen to strengthen at both left and right back.

Swansea's existing left back Neil Taylor has struggled to fill the void left by Ben Davies' summer departure for Tottenham and is a target for Crystal Palace. 

Meanwhile, long-serving right-back Angel Rangel is 32 and there were doubts last months over his ability to play three games in a week.

An offer has gone in for Norwich left-back Martin Olsson.
