The Ebola High Level Protection Suit - yours, on Amazon, for just $1,300. The Internet was awash with products offering protection from the deadly virus which has so far claimed one life in the U.S. 

An infectious disease doctor today rubbished the panic-buying of 'Ebola protection kits' as a waste of money, saying the only use the general public will have for a hazmat suit is as a Halloween costume.

Protective suits, face masks and survival kits have been flying off the shelves amid increasing panic over Ebola in the U.S. after one sufferer died on Wednesday and two remained hospitalized. A total of 48 are being monitored for contagious symptoms.

Online commerce sites are awash with isolation gowns, surgical masks, booties and duct tape claiming to offer full protection from the deadly virus.

There has also been a huge buy-up in preparation kits and supplies. Kits often contain a mix of surgical masks, gloves, bio-hazard bags and sanitizer wipes.

And the price of protection isn't cheap - while a basic Ebola protective kit costs around $50 per person, one high-level protection suit is selling on Amazon for $1,300. 

The bright blue suit, which appears more suited to a space mission than a trip to the mall, is described as a 'Level A Suite'. 

It has a back-entry PVC face shield, attached gloves and three-layers of fabric with 'proprietary barrier films, spunbond nonwoven substrate and inner barrier films'.

However University of Pittsburgh infectious disease expert, Dr Amesh Adalja, told MailOnline today the suits only use would be as a Halloween costume.

Dr Adalja, who sits on the public health committee for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said: '[The suits] are a waste of money.

'Ebola does not pose a risk to the general public because it is not contagious unless you come in contact with the bodily fluids of a symptomatic individual.'

He said that people on the street have little to fear because the virus doesn't spread like the common cold.

He advised Americans to be more concerned with getting their flu vaccines - an infection which kills thousands of people each year.

Dr Adalja added: 'Buying hazmat suits is for a very far-fetched scenario but it's not going to stop people from buying them.

'A suit won't have much use other than as a Halloween costume.' 

Dr Alexis Thomas, who practises in London, also said that there was little use in protective suits for the general public.

She said: 'Panic buying of personal protective clothing e.g. hazmat suits is unnecessary and inappropriate.

'Ebola is transmitted via direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. 

'Unless you are going to be caring directly for someone who has Ebola symptoms and has a high risk of having the disease due to recent travel from an endemic region, buying or wearing a hazmat suit is unnecessary and just helps to further fuel ill-informed hysteria.'

Med-Tech Resource's Ebola kit, which sells for $24.99, is described on their website as the 'ultimate protection and prevention kit for Ebola, influenza, and other outbreaks'

Mountainside Medical Equipment was promoting an Ebola Virus Protection Kit - which came with ten dollars off at $19.95 and included gloves, disinfectant and a biohazard waste bag

A number of sites were quick to target the Ebola market. Mountainside Medical Equipment was promoting an 'Ebola Virus Protection Kit' - which came discounted at $19.95.

A representative for the company told MailOnline today that the kit was for 'personal protection' but the company couldn't '100 per cent guarantee protection against Ebola'.   

Another site, Med-Tech Resource, sells their Ebola Kit for $25, with the words: 'The ultimate protection and prevention kit for Ebola, influenza, and other outbreaks.

'Approved by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), our kit includes everything you need to help prevent the spread of Ebola.'

A representative from the company refused to comment to MailOnline today when asked about the number of kits which had been sold online. 

'Expert' survival guides on how to survive Ebola are being self-published and sold on Amazon - close to 40 have been published in the last month alone

Then there's the literature where the majority of titles appear to be written by self-professed experts.

For about $50, this Ebola kit can be bought online and claims to protect against the virus

One title, 'Ebola: Natural Remedies + Government Conspiracies', poses the question: 'The Ebola virus is here on U.S. soil, why was it welcomed here by the CDC? ... What are they trying to hide?' 

Another publication, 'Ebola Survival Guide 2015: 10 Things you Must Know to Survive the Coming Ebola Outbreak!' comes with a warning label on the cover: 'Ebola could infect 4.1 billion people over the next 24 months!'

In the last 30 days alone, around 40 new Ebola titles have been self-published to be bought as e-books on Amazon.

Dr Adalja refused to comment on specific publications which he had not reviewed but advised those with concerns about Ebola to look at the WHO and CDC websites, which has a wealth of scientifically-verified information on the virus. 

The CDC reported on Wednesday that it is being flooded with more than 800 calls per day from local health workers and patients who are desperate to know if symptoms including headaches, fever and nausea are Ebola.  

Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, became America's 'patient zero' on Wednesday after he was the first person to die from Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.

The Liberian national had arrived in the country on September 20 and was finally hospitalized on September 28 with infection symptoms, after being initially sent home from the hospital with antibiotics. 

Some 48 people, who were in contact with Mr Duncan, are now being monitored, with ten being considered high-risk. 

On Wednesday, a Dallas sheriff's deputy, who was not among the 48 being monitored, attended an urgent-care clinic in Frisco, Texas, with Ebola-like symptoms. 

Ebola test results are pending for Sgt Michael Monnig.

Five U.S. citizens have been diagnosed with Ebola and three of them have beaten the virus. 

Doctors Kent Brantly and Rick Sacra, along with missionary aid worker, Nancy Writebol, were all flown back from Liberia to be treated in U.S. hospitals this summer. They have since received the all-clear.  

NBC News cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, the latest American victim, was quarantined at Nebraska Medical Center on Monday after being flown in from Liberia. 

A fourth victim, a World Health Organization doctor, is being treated in Atlanta.

Close to 3,500 people have died from Ebola in West Africa following the outbreak in December 2013 in Guinea. 

The concern over Ebola echoed the reaction more than a decade ago to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

The disease infected about 8,000 people in 2003, killing nearly 800.
