Theo Walcott may have spent ten months on the sidelines with a serious knee injury, but the Arsenal and England winger insists it has not cost him any of his remarkable pace.

Walcott picked up the injury during the FA Cup tie with Tottenham in January, and has yet to start for Arsenal since.

But after making his first-team comeback off the bench against Burnley last weekend, the speed merchant claimed he is now quicker than ever.

Asked on Twitter whether he was going to be able to produce is former pace, Walcott said he has actually been timed running faster than before he picked up the injury.

And the England star shrugged off claims that he is no longer the fastest player at the club, insisting he is faster than Hector Bellerin.

The young right back broke Walcott's sprint record in pre-season, but the forward insisted 'I'm quicker than him!'

Arsenal travel to Swansea on Sunday, and Walcott will be hoping he can help the Gunners pick up their third league win in a row.
