Lewis Hamilton came under fire yesterday for posting photographs of his ski holiday online while Michael Schumacher lay fighting for his life in a coma.

The British Formula One driver uploaded pictures of his Christmas break on the slopes within days of Schumacher’s horrific ski accident in the French Alps.

Displayed via his Instagram account, the images show Hamilton, 28, smiling as he skis cross-country with one of his beloved pet dogs in his rucksack.

'Horrendously bad taste': Lewis Hamilton has been criticised by Formula One fans for posting this and other pictures online of him skiing as Michael Schumacher fights for life after his horror crash

Several of the images uploaded to the Mercedes driver's Instagram page show him skiing without a helmet

He was criticised on Twitter for not wearing a helmet and for his ‘insensitive’ timing.

In
 another photograph he is  seen wearing a helmet as he stands on the 
piste with his younger brother Nick, 21, who suffers from cerebral 
palsy.

Hamilton wrote: ‘This
 was Christmas Day. I took my brother out on his ski chair, he did his 
first black run. He did amazing! Such a blessing to be with him & my
 family. God is good!!’

On social media sites such as Twitter and Instagram, some  users said the photographs were in ‘bad taste’.

Comments included ‘Shame on you’ and ‘very insensitive given a certain ex race driver’s current condition in hospital’.

Another wrote: ‘He really should think a little and take these down before it harms his good name.’

Some fans came out in support of Hamilton, saying the pictures of him without a helmet were taken while he was hiking or cross-country skiing and that his critics should 'grow up'

Holiday snaps: Hamilton also posted this picture on his Instagram page, saying he had taken his disabled brother, Nic, on his first black run in his ski chair

However, the majority of comments were supportive of the Stevenage-born racing driver.

One
 user wrote: ‘He has only posted one photo of him skiing and in that he 
had a helmet on. The other photos are of him hiking or cross-country 
skiing or walking. Is everyone to stop posting photos of snowy vistas or
 skis full stop? Grow up please.’

Another
 said: ‘He’s walking on snow. Not skiing. The others are cross-country 
which is like walking on snow too. Michael’s injury is awful but that 
shouldn’t stop anyone else enjoying the snow.’

Others explained that helmets are not usually worn for the activity.

‘Cross-country skiing is like “going for a walk” and you do not wear a helmet. Even not in competition,’ one wrote.

Hamilton tweeted a message of support to the seven-time champion and his family the day after his accident

Earlier
 in the week, Hamilton posted a get well message for Schumacher on 
Twitter, whom doctors yesterday described as being in a stable 
condition.

Hamilton said: 
‘Mine & my family’s prayers & thoughts are with Michael & 
his family. I wish him a quick recovery. God Bless him. The Hamiltons.’

Seven-time champion Schumacher, who turns 45 tomorrow, is fighting for 
his life in a Grenoble hospital after falling and hitting his head on a 
rock in the resort of Meribel on Sunday.

He was airlifted from the ski run by a rescue helicopter, suffering from devastating brain injuries.

Schumacher has since undergone two operations to relieve a blood clot and pressure on his brain.

Sabine
 Kehm, the German sportsman’s manager, said yesterday: ‘Michael is 
monitored all the time, his condition was stable all night and this 
morning. It has not changed. It is too early to provide any further 
details.’

Doctors have said the retired Formula One driver has showed signs of ‘slight improvement’, but remains in a critical condition.

His
 family, including wife Corinna, 44, and their two children Gina-Marie, 
16, and Mick, 14, have kept a vigil by his bedside since the accident.

It
 is not known where Hamilton was on holiday, but he flew there in a 
private jet with his two pet bulldogs shortly before Christmas.
