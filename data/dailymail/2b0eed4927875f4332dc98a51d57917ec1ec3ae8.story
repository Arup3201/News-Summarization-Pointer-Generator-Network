British poet Michael Edwards has been formally admitted to the Academie Francaise

A Briton was today finally admitted into France's top body charged with preserving the purity of the Gallic tongue.

Michael Edwards, a poet who had twice tried, and failed, to join the Academie Francaise, is now one of 'The Immortals', as the hallowed body's 40 members are respectfully known.

In his maiden address, he said: 'By opening the doors of your illustrious establishment, you are welcoming in its heart someone who is worse than a foreigner: an Englishman.'

The 74-year-old literature professor, from Barnes, south-west London, added: 'The British would also like to have an institution that defends the English language, especially from Americanisms.'

'It's an earthquake, a revolution, a Briton at the Academie,' said French writer Frederic Vitoux in jest, while welcoming Edwards.

Edwards got voted into the academy on his third try.

Married to a Frenchwoman, Edwards has written several acclaimed books in French and English.

He is a specialist in Shakespeare as well as 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud and 17th century French dramatist Jean Racine.

The bilingual academic, who has dual nationality, taught at Britain's Warwick University until 2002 and at France's prestigious College de France in Paris where he was elected to a chair from 2002 to 2008.

The academy's statutes do not contain any restrictions relating to the nationality of its members.

A commission chosen from among the members of the Academie Francaise advises on what new words should be entered into the French dictionary, studiously defending French against foreign impurities, notably those from English.

Meanwhile, the French Government has made a volte-face on banning the Twitter term 'hashtag' from all official documents.

Until now, the Academie decreed that the French word 'mot-dièse' must be spoken when the '#' symbol appeared in print.

But two of France's major dictionaries, 
Robert and Larousse, have seen the light - and their 2015 editions will 
contain not only 'hashtag' but also 'selfie', 'hipster', 'troll' [in the
 offensive online comment sense of the word] and 'burger'.

'It’s always a very difficult choice. We shouldn’t say "Anglicisms" or "Americanisms", but "Californianisms" because most of these words come from West Coast of the United States, in particular Silicon Valley,' linguist Alain Rey, chief editorial advisor at Le Robert, told Le Parisien.

The Académie Française was created in 1635 by Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister to King Louis XIII.

Its members hold office for life, and the body is the chief authority on the French language and publishes an official dictionary.

In the past, it has asked French speakers
 to replace the word 'Walkman' with 'baladeur', 'software' with 
'logiciel' and 'email' with 'courriel'.

The official uniform of the Academie is a green habit ('habit vert'), with a long black coat and black-feathered hat with golden leaf embroidery.

The style was first adopted during Napoleon Bonaparte's reorganisation of the Institut de France.

To round off the outfit, Immortals wear black trousers and a ceremonial sword.
