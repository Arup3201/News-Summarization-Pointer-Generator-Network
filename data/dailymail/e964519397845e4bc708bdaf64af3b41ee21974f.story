These dazzling images reveal the night sky as it is seldom seen from a city of 5million people.

Photographer Justin Ng spends more than two hours per shot painstakingly capturing the movement of thousands of stars across the void, with spectacular results.

While images of 'star trails' - caused by the earth's rotation when photographed on a long exposure - are common, the 36-year-old digitally enhances his images taken in Singapore and combines several together to create the otherworldly final effect.

Mr Ng began taking astronomical images after he accidentally captured the Milky Way in 2012, on a visit to Mount Bromo in Indonesia.

'People are generally sceptical on star trails images taken in Singapore because the city is heavily light polluted,' he said. 'Many people don't believe such incredible star images can be taken here.

'In my shots, however, you can see the awe-inspiring views I've witnessed.'

However, he added: 'I see myself as an artist rather than a journalist, so some of my images may not make the purists happy. In order to create high quality night sky images, almost all of the images need to go through Photoshop.

'The post processing process becomes more tedious if images are captured in a heavily light polluted city like Singapore.

'I hope everyone can do their part to stop light pollution so we can preserve our dark sky for future generations.'

Spectacular: The images look like a majestic multi-coloured firework or a painting, and are achieved by digitally knitting long-exposure shots together into one photo

Bridge to the sky: This image was captured in Punggol, Singapore, where many of Mr Ng's friends were sceptical because of the amount of light pollution

Edge of the world: A lighthouse in Tuas, Singapore. The stars can be millions of light years away and are given a spiral effect by slowly rotating the camera

Like a rainbow: Star trails can be captured on long-exposure shots because the earth's rotation means the rest of the sky appears to move in relation to the ground

Fiery: This shot at Mount Bromo, Indonesia, would have comprised at least three different images digitally stitched together to achieve different levels of light

Perfect circle: Mr Ng said 'many people don't believe such incredible star images can be taken' in light-polluted Singapore - so he set about trying to prove them wrong
