Disney’s popular animated movie Frozen has been revealed as one of the most talked-about subjects by singles registered on dating website  Match.com.

According to new research published by the online matchmaker, the big screen flick was named as a favorite by more than 5,500 people on the site this year, while a love of selfies and Latin dance workout Zumba were also featured prominently on a huge number of profiles.

The site's customers also had a strong penchant for wanderlust; the word 'travel' showed up more than one million times within the biographies of its users.

And, perhaps eager to seem as unpretentious as possible to any potential matches, a staggering 232,348 opted to use the tired cliche 'down to earth' when drafting their personal statements.

Unsurprisingly, it seems it was nigh on impossible for many of Match.com’s users to avoid using the word 'selfie' in 2014; during the past 12 months, the popular buzzword appeared 5,613 times on the site.

And on the topic of photos, straight women posted the most profile pictures (3.6 on average), while straight men posted an average of 2.8, and gay men and lesbians each posted 2.3.

Other common terms reflected users' professions and hobbies as well as the friendly demeanor they aimed to project. 'Electrician', 'welcoming', 'warmhearted', 'crochet' and 'cosmetology' were also among the most popular words featured across the site.

Jezebel responded to the banal findings by compiling a hilarious list of suggested  topics more compelling than Zumba, which included the true crime podcast Serial, longtime Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak and 'the effect of isolationist foreign policy of Edo-era Japan'.

City love: The dating site also revealed that Miami residents replied to the most messages, while singles in Albany, New York, logged onto the site the most often

Match.com, which claims to have been responsible for about 5.5 million dates in 2014, also revealed that Miami residents replied to the most messages, while singles in Albany, New York, logged onto the site the most often.

And date seekers in Anchorage, Alaska, were the most likely to search for matches outside of their own city.

But those who are looking for true love would be well-advised to move to Portland, Maine, the city that saw the most users close their accounts because they 'met someone' in 2014.
