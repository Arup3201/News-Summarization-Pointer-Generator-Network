Google has come under fire for allowing users to download a game from its app store encouraging hunters to shoot dead naked homosexuals. 

The technology giant has removed Ass Hunter from its app store, Google Play, after it was downloaded more than 10,000 times. 

Sickeningly, it encouraged users: 'your mission is to kill as many gays as possible' before advancing to the next level.

Google has come under fire for listing a game which encourages users to shoot naked homosexuals 

The app sees players hunt down homosexual men with shotguns for points. 

On its listing on Google Play, the game's provider is listed as App Day, though the company denies ever producing such content.

It has been removed from Google Play since being listed on November 5, but can still be downloaded on other app sites for free. 

In its description, it says: 'Gays may be hidden in bushes and unexpectedly catch you.

'Remember! When they catch you they will do with you whatever they want.' 

A score of disgusted internet users commented on the game's content in the review section before it was taken off the website. 

'This developer is despicable. I cannot comprehend how someone could create a "game" so wilfully ignorant, hateful, vile and violence,' one user said. 

The app was downloaded thousands of times before being removed from Google

'Do you realize that young gay men and women are attacked all the time, and your game could be the incentive for someone to act on their ignorance?

'Normalizing violence is never okay. By creating and publishing this ‘game,’ you’re sending the message that you condone such violence.

'Shame. Shame on you. I will not rest until your developer account is deleted and you are laughed into obscurity.'

Others described the game as 'sickening'. 

Gay rights charity Stonewall said the game could have a 'damaging' effect on young people. 

A spokesman told MailOnline: 'Its shocking that a company like Google who pride themselves on cutting edge technology would feature a game with attitudes more likened to the last century.

'This will be incredibly offensive to a lot of people. We're glad to see they've acted quickly to take it down but technology companies have a responsibility to help protect people, particularly young people from incredibly offensive material which portrays gay men as predators and with characters whose sole mission it is is to murder. 

'It's an incredibly damaging message'. 

Despite removing the app earlier today, Google declined to comment on the game or respond to accusations of homophobia. 

Grahame Robertson, from The Lesbian & Gay Foundation, said: 'This game is a despicable form of homophobia which is nothing short of an incitement of violence towards gay and bisexual men.

The 'sickening' app places the player as the hunter in a virtual world where they are told to kill or evade homosexuals to win points and advance to the next stage

Disgusted internet users shamed Google for listing the app on its Play store in the review section of the site

'Google have a moral responsibility as a global brand to demonstrate that they will not accept such frighteningly homophobic apps or games such as this. 

'Google's silence over this issue is extremely worrying.'

Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell also slammed the tech giant for refusing to apologise for the Ass Hunter blunder.

Peter said: 'It's shocking that anyone would want to create a violent, homophobic 'game.'

'I'm glad that Google have deleted it, but surprised and disappointed that they have not issued a clear and public condemnation of it.

'Such a vile, violent inflammatory game clearly violates Google's ethical policies, and clearly it should not have been downloaded thousands upon thousands of times before deletion.

'I would expect Google to issue a strongly-worded condemnation and apology.

'Their silence is baffling.

'Even when big companies make unintentional mistakes, even if they have had no direct control over the incident, they usually issue robust apologies.

'I'm really shocked that Google have not done this.'
