Treated to a hero’s welcome at Shannon Airport and a civic reception at Limerick’s City Hall on Merchant’s Quay on Wednesday, it is surely a feeling Andy Lee could get used to.

The new WBO middleweight champion is the 21st Irish boxer to claim a legitimate world title (current IBF super-bantamweight kingpin Carl Frampton coming before him) and the Castleconnell native has expressed his firm intention to defend the belt on home soil.

In the ring following his sixth-round stoppage of Russia’s Matt Korobov in Las Vegas last Saturday, Lee declared in his post-fight speech: ‘I’m a champion now and I want to defend my belt in Ireland.’

But while he is a proud Irishman, having represented the country at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Lee’s fighting story began at the famous Repton Boxing Club, originally a landmark of London’s East End.

Born in Bow, near Whitechapel, the son of settled Travellers, a young Lee followed his elder brothers into Repton.

Back-to-back British Schoolboy titles were won in 1998/99 before his family moved back to Castleconnell, where he continued his boxing career at the St Francis club, going on to claim a silver medal for Ireland at the World Junior Championships in 2002 (where he was spotted by future coach Emanuel ‘Manny’ Steward) and a bronze medal at the 2004 European Championships in Croatia, which secured his place as Ireland’s only boxer in Athens.

After opting to turn pro under Steward in 2006, moving to Detroit in the process, the Limerick man began a paid career which has so far lasted eight-and-a-half years.

He dedicated his victory last weekend to Steward, ‘the man who made me’, but he has now come full circle in his boxing career, linking up with London-based trainer Adam Booth and relocating to the English capital where he relaunched his career following a failed 2012 title challenge to then WBC champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.

With champion Peter Quillin vacating his WBO title, Lee took advantage by capitalising on the high (No 4) ranking earned from his knockout of Julian Jackson last June to book a date with mandatory No 1 contender Korobov, stopping the Russian in style.

Not only has the win seen Lee fulfil his ultimate ambition of becoming a world champion, but it may also secure his financial future. Lee, however, claimed he is not in it for the money.

‘That was never the motivation,’ said Lee last weekend. ‘It was to do something in my life that was bigger than me and it’ll never be taken away from me now. I’ll always be a world champion.’

His principles and desire are characteristics which have helped him gain a deserved reputation as the gentleman of Irish boxing, but financial realities may yet have an influence on his future moves.

While, ideally, Lee wants to fight in Ireland, he may not be able to dictate terms despite being the champ.

The opportunity to fight for the vacant title came as No 2 contender Billy Joe Saunders opted to take on domestic rival Chris Eubank Jr, whom he defeated on points last month, and Saunders, the European and British champion (who is also a former Olympian) is now the mandatory No 1 challenge

Speaking to Sportsmail this week, his promoter Frank Warren claimed that an agreement had been made with Booth that allowed Lee to fight Korobov for the vacant title on the understanding the new champion would fight Saunders early next year.

It is a fight that Lee claims he is more than happy to take, but only in Ireland. In reality, the supposed agreement between Booth and Warren is likely to mean the latter will have to acquiesce to such a proposal — something Warren has not ruled out — but the promoter could push for a March date in London, possibly on St Patrick’s weekend.

Failure to come to terms would likely lead to purse bids for the promotional rights to the fight. But one thing is for sure — Lee is likely to enjoy his biggest pay day yet when it comes to his first defence, a likely six figures.

His purse against Korobov was $69,000, but that figure would have been negotiated on the basis of getting the opportunity to fight for the title. A better indicator of his future purses was his opponent’s pay, as Korobov, mandatory challenger for the vacant belt, took home $160,000. Quillin, who opted not to defend against Korobov, walked away from what would have been a career-high $1.4m pay day.

The fact that Lee is rated by US TV network HBO plays into his favour as TV money still pays the bills in big-time boxing. On the same Las Vegas bill as Lee-Korobov, headliner Tim Bradley earned €2million, while across town on the same night Amir Khan, a US TV regular, made $950,000.

Lee’s previous fight may be an even better barometer of his potential bank balance, considering the money splashed out that night. While Lee made $70,000 taking on Jackson, the headline fight that night between Miguel Cotto and Sergio Martinez saw Cotto earn a $3m purse ($7m in total), with Martinez making $1.5m plus pay-per-view TV money.

Cotto, the WBC world champion, is one of the sport’s main money earners. Whatever about Lee’s eagerness to defend his own title, the financial rewards for fighting Cotto would be astronomical while there is also the lure of his WBC belt and lineal championship.

Speaking in September, Lee said: ‘He [Cotto] is the [lineal] middleweight champion of the world and, for me, I think he’s one of the easier champions to fight style-wise.’

The fact there are four ‘major’ world champions is a subject which irks most boxing enthusiasts as well as causal fans, but it is a reality Lee accepts. While he holds the WBO title, Cotto is the WBC champion and ‘the man who beat the man’ with his lineal title traced back to the original champion.

Gennady Golovkin holds the WBA championship (and is rated by most as the best middleweight in the world) while veteran Jermain Taylor holds the IBF title.

‘Golovkin’s considered the world champion, really,’ said Lee, speaking to 4Thumps Irish boxing podcast. ‘I know, in the purest sense, having one championship belt is a nice thing and it would probably be better, genuinely, to sort everything out. But where there’s more belts more people get to fight and then champions can hopefully fight each other.’

Ideally, that is what Lee would aim for — a unification clash — but the shadow of Saunders looms. Otherwise, a domestic dust-up against Matthew Macklin remains an option, despite his recent loss.

If Booth were to negotiate with Warren to allow Lee to have a keep-busy fight in the new year before meeting Saunders, it could open a path to a spring clash with the likes of Macklin, where a win would set up a summer blockbuster against the mandatory challenger at Thomond Park.

Fanciful thinking since a March date with Saunders seems inevitable, but dreams sometimes come true — just ask Andy Lee.
