This is the lengthy queue that formed at a faulty cashpoint that started spewing out free money.

Ecstatic customers flocked to the Bank of Scotland ATM after realising the machine was dispensing extra cash today.

The machine was reported to be issuing double he amount requested by customers making withdrawals, until police were alerted and stood guard at the cashpoint until the bank could shut down the machine.

Too good to be true: Disbelieving customers flocked to the cash point when they realised it was dispensing extra notes

The Bank of Scotland was eventually able to switch off the machine remotely after being alerted to the costly blunder. It said it was unlikely to take action because of the difficulty of tracing all the payments dispensed this afternoon.

A crowd had gathered when the ATM, on Stonelaw Road in the Burnside area of Rutherglen, Glasgow, started pumping out the extra notes.

The branch said it would 'contact any customers who have been affected'.

Word of the fault spread after a picture of the queue at the bank machine was posted on Twitter.

One user, Lauren, tweeted: 'The bank of Scotland at Burnside was giving out double money now police are standing there so no one can go to it #gutting'.

Disappointed Mark Gallagher, who uses the Stonelaw Road branch, tweeted: 'I was elsewhere'.

Bonus: The cashpoint in Scotland was reported to be dispensing double the amount of money requested by customers making withdrawals

The bank said in a statement: 'We can confirm that, for a very short period of time, the ATM in Burnside, Glasgow, was mis-dispensing cash.

'It will be difficult to trace all payments, as they won’t all be our customers, so it’s unlikely that we will take action.

'We apologise for any inconvenience caused.'
