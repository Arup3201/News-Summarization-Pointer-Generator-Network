A mobile phone belonging to a maths tutor charged with sexually assaulting his underage clients may help police identify up to 40 possible victims of the 66-year-old.

Police have uncovered evidence which could suggest that Quy Huy Hoang could have come in to contact with more  than the six children he has has been accused of sexually assaulting  between 2007 and 2014.

Up to 40 Images of underage boys and girls have allegedly surfaced on his phone which police seized during a dramatic arrest outside his Greystanes home, in Sydney's west, earlier this month.

A 66-year-old maths tutor was arrested on his doorstep in Greystanes on Tuesday morning

The man was charged with sexually assaulting five of his young clients aged between 5 and 7 years old

After the man answered the door and words were exchanged between him and the two officers he attempted to walk back inside the house when a male officer stopped him by grabbing his shoulder and putting on the handcuffs 

So far six of his alleged victims - the latest a seven-year-old girl - have been identified by police but now they are ramping up their investigation in the search for more.

Child Abuse Squad commander Detective Inspector Peter Yeomans said the priority for police was now tracking down the rest.

'Police are endeavouring to locate or identify the children within the mobile phone in order to identify further offences,' he said.  

Each of the clients were  aged between five and seven when the assaults occurred during private  tutoring sessions from his Greystances home and elsewhere across Sydney.

It is understand he advertised through word of mouth and perhaps in local Vietnamese newspapers.

The latest line of inquiry comes following dramatic footage released by police this month during Mr Hoang's arrest where he was promptly handcuffed and and locked away in the back of a police van to be taken to Merrylands police station.

The State Crime Command's Child Abuse Squad Detectives charged the man with numerous child sex offences including two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years (under authority), two counts of aggravated indecent assault (victim under 16 years) and four counts of aggravated act of indecency (victim under 16 years).

The charges are in addition to a number of similar charges preferred against the man last month.

In court, detectives will allege the man sexually assaulted five children - two boys and three girls aged between five and seven - all of whom were clients of his mathematics tutoring business. 

The offences are alleged to have occurred at various locations throughout Sydney between 2007 and 2014.

The man was refused bail and scheduled to appear in Fairfield Local Court today.
