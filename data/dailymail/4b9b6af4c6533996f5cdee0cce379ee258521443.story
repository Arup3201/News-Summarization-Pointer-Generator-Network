When James Howells spilt lemonade on his laptop, he decided it was not worth keeping.

But he is now ruing his decision – after he realised it had £5million worth of virtual currency stored on  the hard drive. 

The stash that could make him a millionaire is now buried under four feet of rubbish and mud in a landfill site.

James Howells, an IT worker from South Wales, pictured, had used his laptop to 'mine' 7,500 units of digital Bitcoin currency in 2009. At the time the coins - which are units of data stored in 'wallets' on a computer - were practically worthless. But as more and more people heard about the new currency, its value has soared

The 28-year-old IT worker had accumulated 7,500 units of  ‘bitcoin’ soon after it was launched in 2009.

Back then his stash of ‘coins’ – which
 are units of data stored on his computer – was worth around £20 but 
their value has soared after the currency took off among online traders.

The price of a single bitcoin reached 
 £664 yesterday, meaning Mr Howells’ haul is worth an incredible 
£5million.

Windfall: Bitcoins could be generated for next to nothing when they were first introduced in 2009, but are now worth more than £600 each

Buried treasure: Mr Howells' valuable hard drive is estimated to be under four feet of rubbish kept on a landfill site (file picture)

Last week, it dawned on  him how valuable his collection had 
become and he went looking for the hard drive.

But when he got to the landfill site 
in Newport, South Wales, workers broke the bad news that it could be 
anywhere beneath an area of rubbish the size of a football pitch.

Launched in 2009, Bitcoins can be exchanged for goods online and used as virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes.

As with any currency, their value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange them for. In 2011, one bitcoin was worth £1.50 while today it is worth £664.

Customers can buy bitcoins  from online exchanges.

They are growing more popular among the public and investors but have yet to be accepted by websites of major retailers such as Amazon.

Bitcoins are stored in a ‘wallet’ on the hard drive of a computer and can be accessed  using a ‘private key’.

Because they can be bought anonymously, critics say they are used for all sorts of criminal acts such as money laundering.

He told the Guardian: ‘You know when 
you put something in the bin, and in your head, say to yourself “That’s a
 bad idea”? I really did have that.’  

Bitcoins – which were introduced by a 
mysterious programmer known as Satoshi Nakamoto –  exist only as units 
of digital data and are not backed by a central bank.

They can be bought, sold and even 
‘mined’, which means they are created by enthusiasts who use powerful 
computers to solve complex mathematical problems.

Mr Howells generated his stash in 
early 2009, when the currency was known only in tech circles, by running
 a programme on his laptop for a week.

But he stopped when his girlfriend complained the laptop was getting too noisy.

In 2010, the Dell XPS N1710 broke 
after he spilt lemonade on it, so he dismantled the computer  for parts,
 kept the drive in a desk drawer and later binned it.

His hoard can only be accessed using a
 ‘private key’, or digital code. The problem is, the only copy is on his
 buried hard drive.

Mr Howells said he does not mind if hopefuls try digging for the device.

‘If they were to offer me a share, 
fair enough. There’s a pot of gold there for someone It’s my mistake 
throwing the hard drive out, at the end of the day.’

But even if somebody does find it, 
they won’t be able to get their hands on the cash without his help 
because the code is encrypted.

A Newport Council spokesman said any treasure hunters turning up at the tip would be turned away.

She added: ‘Obviously, if it was easily retrieved, we’d return it.’

James Howells, from South Wales, 'generated' the Bitcoins in 2009 on his laptop

At the time the 7,500 coins he made were almost completely worthless

He later took the hard-drive out of the laptop and kept it in a drawer

@highlight

But he threw it out in 2012 and only remembered the Bitcoins last week

@highlight

Each one is now worth £613 - or £4,597,000 in total
