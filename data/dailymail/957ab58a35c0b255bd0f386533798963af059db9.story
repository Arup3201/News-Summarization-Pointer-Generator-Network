The International Cricket Council has announced it is to consider the ruling from the James Anderson-Ravindra Jadeja case before deciding whether to appeal.

England seamer Anderson, who was training with his team-mates at Old Trafford on Tuesday ahead of the fourth Test, was last week cleared of any wrong-doing by judicial commissioner Gordon Lewis relating to an incident with India all-rounder Jadeja in the first Investec Test at Trent Bridge, with insufficient evidence said to be crucial in the retired Australian judge's verdict.

With the Board of Control for Cricket in India unable to appeal the decision, only the ICC - where India hold increasingly significant political sway - can act.

While it may yet decide there is no case to answer, an appeal could mean both decisions are liable to be overturned although the ICC has until Sunday before it decides whether or not to take the case further.

The body said in a short statement: 'The International Cricket Council (ICC) today confirmed that it has received and is considering the written decision of His Honor Gordon Lewis AM, the Judicial Commissioner, in respect of his findings that England's James Anderson and Ravindra Jadeja of India were not guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct and Player Support Personnel, following an exhaustive disciplinary hearing which was held in Southampton on Friday.

'As per Section 8.3.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct, ICC Chief Executive David Richardson has seven days - until Sunday, 10 August - to consider whether to lodge an appeal against the decision.

'The ICC will make no further comment on this matter until the decision has been made.'

Option: The ICC could still appeal the case, which saw Jadeja's (right) claims deemed false
