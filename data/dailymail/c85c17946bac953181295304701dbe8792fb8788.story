Japanese police are weighing up whether an 'asexual' man who cooked his own severed genitals and served them to five paying diners committed a crime, it has emerged.

Mao Sugiyama, 22, had his penis and testicles surgically removed in March and kept them frozen for two months before cooking them at a public event in May.

Diners each paid £160 for a portion which was garnished with mushrooms and parsley. Before tucking into dinner, guests sat down to listen to a piano recital.

The police probe came after the mayor of Suginami ward, the Tokyo district where the event took place, said it had involved the display of obscene objects.

Mayor Ryo Tanaka said: 'Many residents of Suginami and elsewhere have expressed a sense of discomfort and feeling of apprehension over this.'

A Tokyo police spokesman said she was aware of the complaint but declined to comment any further.

Sugiyama, a painter who defines himself as 'asexual', has also not responded to the fact he could now be prosecuted.

But he has previously confirmed the event had taken place and said it was organised to raise awareness about 'sexual minorities, x-gender, asexual people'.

In tweets on May 18, the artist said steps were taken so his act met all relevant laws, including a ban on organ sales, processing of medical waste and even food sanitation requirements.

He also said he had offered to cook his penis for a guest for £800. However, he ultimately decided to split the ‘meal’ between six guests.

He wrote on Twitter: ‘I am offering my male genitals (full penis, testes, scrotum) as a meal for 100,000 yen (£800). I’m Japanese.

‘The organs were surgically removed at age 22. I was tested to be free of venereal diseases. The organs were of normal function. I was not receiving female hormone treatment.

‘First interested buyer will get them, or I will also consider selling to a group. Will prepare and cook as the buyer requests, at his chosen location. If you have questions, please contact me by DM or e-mail.’

Sugiyama said his genitals had been removed by a physician and certified free of infections.

In total around 70 people attended the event in the Suginami ward of Tokyo. While five people tucked into Mao Sugiyama’s genitalia, the rest of them ate beef or crocodile.

The people who ate his genitalia were a 30-year-old couple, a 22-year-old women, a 32-year-old man and Shigenobu Matsuzawa, 29, an event planner.

He Tweeted before the event: ‘It’s a once in a lifetime chance, so I decided on the spur of the moment to do it.’

He posted pictures of the event on his blog, but later removed them and said his decision to take them down was due to ‘privacy considerations’.

Sugiyama made guests sign a waiver so he was not responsible if they became ill after eating his genitalia.

The dinner party organiser joked before the event that he would be posting his recipe online. Guests said that the genitalia were very rubbery and tasted of very little, CalorieLab.com reported.

Sugiyama, who is an illustrator, has also had his nipples removed. As an asexual, his genitalia will not be replaced with artificial female ones.
