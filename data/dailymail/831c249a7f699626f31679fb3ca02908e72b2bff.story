A shop worker today told how she was left feeling like a sucker after 'lending' her Henry Hoover to a thief who has duped 16 businesses out of the smiley-faced appliances.

Jenn Hall, 53, thought she was being helpful when she gave her company's vacuum cleaner to a man who claimed his had broken while cleaning at a nearby business.

But she learned she had been the victim of a serial trickster when she went to collect it - and was told the company did not know the man.

Police are now investigating the theft of 16 Henry Hoovers from businesses in Brighton, East Sussex, and nearby Worthing.

The offences date from November 22 last year to February 7 this year, and they are worth around £100 each.

Mrs Hall, assistant manager of Simplicare, a company that sell disability equipment in Brighton, said: 'He came in saying he was from a business down the road.

'He asked if he could borrow our vacuum cleaner for ten minutes because his had broken.

'We are a friendly bunch on this estate and often lend things to each other, so I thought nothing of it. I actually thought I was being helpful.

'He name-dropped a few people who he apparently worked with and I believed his story.

'He was very convincing and took me in.

See ya, sucker: The thief spins a sob story about how his own hoover has broken and he desperately needs to clean, duping kind-hearted workers

'About half an hour later, when he failed to return, I went down the road to collect it and was told they had never heard of the guy.

'They also told me they had heard about other businesses that had been targeted by the Henry Hoover thief. It seems he is quite prolific.

'I believe he was stealing them to sell on because they are quite expensive.

'Most businesses tend to use them because they are hard-wearing and suck up everything.'

Pharmacist Al Twigge, 48, from Stallion Chemists, in Brighton, also handed over his Henry to a man who claimed to work for a nearby business.

Henry Hoovers are worth around £100 and are popular with businesses thanks to their hardiness

He said: 'The man came in saying he was preparing for an important function nearby and his vacuum cleaner had blown-up.

'I lent him ours but thought it was strange when he failed to return a few hours later.

'I went to the shop where he said he worked and was told the guy did not work there.

'It is bizarre that he is stealing just Henrys. They are not the sort of thing you would expect somebody to take.'

Mr Twigge is believed to be the first victim of the Henry thief. The last reported theft was from the Journey's Hostel, in Brighton.

Officers have arrested a man on suspicion of theft and today asked any other businesses who believe they may also be a victim to contact them.

A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'A man has been arrested on suspicion of the thefts of 'Henry' vacuum cleaners.

'At around 7.55pm on Thursday, February 7, police were called to Journeys Hostel after a vacuum cleaner had been borrowed by someone and not returned earlier in the day.

'A 32-year-old man from Brighton was arrested on Friday, February 8, on suspicion of the theft of 16 vacuum cleaners between November 22, 2012, and February 7, 2013.

'He has been bailed until April 4 pending further enquiries.

'Police had been contacted by several businesses complaining that a man had entered their businesses asking to borrow a vacuum cleaner and not returned it.'

Bizarre thief may have struck 16 times throughout the South-East

He fools businesses into thinking his hoover has broken and borrows theirs

Only when he does not return do they realise they've been hustled
