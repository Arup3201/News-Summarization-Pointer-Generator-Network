The rooms are filthy, there's no hot water and the guests are encouraged to dry themselves off with the curtains to save on washing.

But customers of the Hans Brinker Budget Hostel in Amsterdam can never say they weren't warned.

To prevent complaints, the owners of 
the $22.50 (£18)-a-night hotel feel it is best to tell people in advance about what to expect, even if that means a potentially fatal disease or mental illness.

Uninviting: The owners of the Hans Brinker Budget Hostel in Amsterdam are happy to admit it is probably the worst hotel around

Grotty: The rooms at Hans Brinker Budget Hostel are, by the owner's admission, filthy and there's no hot water

Brutal honesty: One of the hotel's adverts ensures the customers are in no doubt what to expect

A lengthy disclaimer on their website 
reads: 'Those wishing to stay at the Hans Brinker Budget Hotel, 
Amsterdam, do so at their own risk and will not hold the hotel liable 
for food poisoning, mental breakdowns, terminal illness, lost limbs, 
radiation poisoning, certain diseases associated with the 18th century, 
plague, etc.'

From grotty 
rooms without a view to dirty bathrooms with no hot water, the owners 
are happy to admit it is probably the worst hotel around.

The
 lift is broken so signs point guests towards the 'eco-friendly 
elevator' - or stairs - and by not providing hot water they claim 'it 
keeps water consumption moderate.'

They even encourage those who want to shower to dry off using the curtains to save on washing and in turn 'save the planet'.

Hoping you have a life-changing stay: A disclaimer on the hotel's website warns of the dangers of contracting a potentially fatal disease

Infectious: Despite the self-damning promotional material, the hotel seems to be a hit with travellers from all over the world who are scrambling to book one of the 127 rooms at the hotel

Life of luxury: Fortunately most of the target clientele, made up of students and backpackers, seem to appreciate the honest charm the Hans Brinker offers

Introducing the 'eco-towel': Customers are encouraged to dry themselves off with the curtains

Advertising
 slogans include 'It can't get any worse. But we'll do our best' as well
 as 'Improve your immune system - stay at Hans Brinker!' or the modest 
claim 'Now with beds in every room.'

But
 this hilariously honest approach seems to be a hit with travellers from
 all over the world - who are scrambling to book one of the 127 rooms at
 the hotel.

Hotel comparison websites are packed with mixed reviews.

One
 traveller from Australia wrote: 'For the reputation of the world's 
worst hotel, it wasn't as bad as I thought. Pretty scabby still, very 
basic. The bathroom was atrocious.'

Another
 added: 'I'd read other reviews of the hostel before we got there, so 
was a bit nervous. Unfortunately most of the reviews I'd read were 
completely true. The rooms were like prison cells, with rickety old beds
 and metal lockers that didn't close properly.'

A more promising review reads: 'Hans 
Brinker is a fun-filled hostel with great facilities, friendly staff and
 great location. You will not be disappointed.'

Fortunately
 most of the target clientele, made up of students and backpackers, seem
 to appreciate the honest charm the Hans Brinker offers.

The
 owners, who have penned a book available on Amazon about the hotel 
entitled 'The Worst Hotel in the World', insist most guests are 
pleasantly surprised when they arrive.

Manager
 Tijmen Receveur said: 'They love our humour and sarcasm - and they have
 diminished their expectations to less than nothing.'
