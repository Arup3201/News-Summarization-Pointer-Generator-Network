Nothing evokes a sense of place like the heady waft of a familiar smell. 

And passengers travelling from Heathrow's Terminal 2 can now be transported to across the world in a single sniff. 

To celebrate the completion of its newly reinvigorated terminal, the airport has installed a 'scent globe' which shoots out the smell of its most fragrant destinations, intending to 'take passengers on a sensory journey before even setting foot on their flights'.

Smell you later: Passengers travelling from Heathrow's Terminal 2 can experience the new scent globe

Perched in the departure lounge, the orb offers curious globetrotters whiffs of Thailand, South Africa, Japan, China and Brazil. The selection were chosen for their popularity with Heathrow air passengers.

To conjure up the essence of the five nations, Heathrow worked with Design in Scent, to produce tailor-made scents from ingredients associated with the designated country.

South Africa's smell captures the adventure of safari with notes of tribal incense, wild grass and musky animalics through the scent of Hyraceum (a rock like substance made from the excrement of the Cape hyrax).

While Brazil's scent oozes rich rainforest fauna with a palette of coffee, tobacco and jasmine.

While some destinations have smells travellers would rather forget, here are Heathrow's interpretations of the following heaven-scented locations:

South Africa - The adventure of safari with notes of tribal incense, wild grass and musky animalics

Japan - Cool, oceanic tones with a mix of seaweed and shell extracts, green tea and Ambergris

China -  Mystical temple incense and subtle Osmanthus Fragrans flower create an orient explosion

Thailand -  An appetising mix of lemongrass, ginger and coconut

Brazil -  Rich rainforest fauna with a palette of coffee, tobacco and jasmine

Japan is brought to life through cool, oceanic tones with a mix of seaweed and shell extracts, green tea and Ambergris, capturing the essence of coastal villages synonymous with the great Pacific Island.

According to the Heathrow Airport website: 'China's mystical temple incense and subtle Osmanthus Fragrans flower create an orient explosion' and 'Thailand tantalises the taste buds with an appetising mix of lemongrass, ginger and coconut'. 

Normand Boivin, Chief Operating Officer at the airport said: 'Heathrow connects the UK to 180 destinations in 28 countries and carries over 72 million passengers a year.

T2: The newly renovated terminal, which opened in June, is now operating at full capacity

'Heathrow is the UK's hub airport; mixing direct passengers, transfers and freight to make long haul flights viable. We strive to offer a unique experience that delights our passengers.'

'These specially created scents will give passengers travelling through Terminal 2 an exclusive preview of destinations that only Heathrow connects to.' 

Last week saw Heathrow's brand new Terminal 2 operate at full capacity with all 26 airlines now in their new home. Three and a half million passengers' fly out from Terminal 2 on over 21,000 flights in the last five months.
