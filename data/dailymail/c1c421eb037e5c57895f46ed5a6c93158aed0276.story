An advertisement from 1987 predicting the future prices of groceries, airfares and property has surfaced online exposing its hilariously incorrect calculations.

The pamphlet advertising superannuation in South Australia features a list of items comparing their 1987 price with 'what they will cost' in 2010.

Some of the predictions grossly overestimated the price of items - including $99.81 movie tickets for two, $1086.22 for a kid's bicycle and $8807.19 return airfares to London.

A 1987 pamphlet advertising superannuation in South Australia has surfaced online

It compares prices between 1987 and 2010, with some grossly overestimated predictions including $8807.19 return airfares to London

Current prices for those items sit at $40 for movie tickets, kid's bikes for $100-$200 and flights from Adelaide to London for about $2000.

Other predictions were way under the mark - including a first home for $293,573.18.

The Real Estate Institute of SA said median house prices in 2010 were $406,000 in Adelaide and $379,000 South Australia-wide.

The ad posted to Reddit, which was released before the Keating government introduced compulsory superannuation in 1992, aims to get people to invest more money in their super accounts.

The list predicted it would $1086.22 for a kid's bicycle, based on an average inflation rate of 8 per cent a year

'If you want a reasonable lifestyle by the time you retire, now is the time to act,' the pamphlet reads.

'These figures are not "pie-in-the-sky"; they are based on an average inflation rate of 8% a year – which has been the figure for the past 20 years.'

The ad assumes that inflation is the only thing that will have an impact on the price of items, but fails to predict a number of other influences.

The housing bubble saw property prices rise at an even higher rate, while increased competition in the airline industry has kept travel prices relatively low.

The price of a 'family saloon car' or sedan was estimated to rise to $105,686 – whereas a person can easily purchase that type of car for $20,000-$25,000

Other incorrect predictions include a taxi fare from Adelaide to Dulwich for $26.42, with the current price actually sitting between $11 and $16.

The chart also predicted the pension would rise to $623.54 for singles and $1039.83 for couples. In 2010, the pension actually sat at $701.10 for singles and $1057 for couples.

Some prices, such as a $35.22 bottle of wine and a $7.63 tram fare to Glenelg, were not so far off the mark.
