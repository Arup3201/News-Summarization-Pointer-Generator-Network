She was born into Australia’s political aristocracy, educated at the finest schools and stands to share in her late father’s $40million fortune.

But this week the drug addict daughter of Neville Wran, the late premier of New South Wales, was facing a murder charge.

Harriet Wran, 26, told police she was  ‘numb on ice’ at the time of the attack in the inner-Sydney suburb of Redfern on Sunday and had been ‘off her guts for days’.

Ex-premier's daughter Harriet Wran is 'addicted to ice' and had been living rough in the weeks before a man was stabbed to death in run-down Sydney unit

Her spectacular fall from grace was documented in a dramatic few minutes at Liverpool Local Court where she was jointly charged with the murder of Daniel McNulty, a musician and suspected drug dealer.

The 45-year-old was stabbed twice, once in the left knee and once in the back, which fatally punctured his lung.

A second man, Brett Fitzgerald, 42, was also wounded during the incident and remains in a stable condition at Sydney’s St Vincent’s Hospital.

Wran told police she had gone to the address because she was desperate to buy drugs but never thought that the two men she was with ‘would do what they did’.

She claimed that she ‘froze’ and only did what she was told to do because she was terrified of co-accused Lloyd Haines, 29 and Michael Lee, 35, her boyfriend of two weeks.

Police believe that the killing happened after a $70 drug deal went wrong.

Wran was described as a self-confessed ice addict who had been living rough after leaving her family’s luxury home in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Woollahra.

She is understood to have been battling drug addictions for several years and had been in recovery, only to relapse after her father’s death in April.

Wran, who faces charges of murder, attempted murder and break and enter, did not apply for bail.

Her lawyer Winston Terracini SC, said that she would plead not guilty and the matter was adjourned until October 8.

Lee will appear in court on the same day while Haines is due to appear at Sydney’s Central Local Court on October 9.

Wran was last seen in public at her father’s state funeral on May 1, when she and her younger brother Hugo read poems at the service.

She wore long sleeves, apparently to cover the tattoos on her arms.

At the time of her arrest, she had no cash and no cards, and appeared dishevelled.

The troubled heiress was born in 1998 into a privileged existence created by her barrister turned politician father and his glamorous second wife Jill Hickson.

The couple sent their daughter to elite private schools, Ascham and Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School (SCEGGS) in Darlinghurst, before she went to the University of Sydney to study  Modern and Ancient History.

She has worked as a producer on The Weather Channel. On her Facebook page, she talks of being 'interested in men', lists 'twisties and chocolate in the afterlife' as her religious views, while to the question of political views she responds with a 'meh'.

 Wran’s father was the son of a seaman and coal lumper who ended up as a Queen's Counsel to the NSW bar, premier of the state from 1976 to 1986 and an icon of the Australian Labor Party.

His longevity as leader, coupled with the successful career enjoyed by his glamorous wife Jill Hickson Wran, gave the family an almost aristocratic air, enabling them to mix as easily with the general public as they did with kings, queens and billionaires.

This was perhaps best exemplified by the choice made by Diana, Princess of Wales ahead of a 1996 charity ball attended by some of the country's biggest names.

'The People's Princess' decided to give first dance to Neville Wran and the charismatic politician nicknamed 'Nifty' quite literally swept Diana off her feet, to the delight of hundreds of onlookers at the Victor Chang Institute Charity Ball.

Mr Wran reportedly agonised over being an 'older father' to his second family, but his younger children were devoted to him as he retired from public life and entered his senior years.

He died on April 20 this year aged 87. Both Harriet and her brother Hugo were at his bedside.

His death sparked a bitter family battle over the estate; which included a $10 million mansion in Woollahra, as well as multi-million-dollar properties in Woolloomooloo, Palm Beach and the Yarramalong Valley.

Mr Wran had two children and an adopted son from his first marriage to Marcia Oliver.

He had separated from his second wife in 2006 but they were reconciled in 2011.

Ms Hicks is reportedly embroiled in a dispute with her late husband’s daughter Kim Sheftell about the contents of his will.
