A live chicken that was thrown into a McDonald's has escaped unharmed from the prank and is off to join a new flock of birds, after being aptly named Nugget. 

Pranksters threw a live chicken through the serving hatch of the drive through of the fast food chain at Wolviston Services near Billingham in Stockton-on-Tees after ordering for a meal.

One of the culprits who threw Nugget has now come forward after the RSPCA rescued the bird and announced it was trying to trace the perpetrators of the prank, who could easily have harmed the animal.  

This chicken was thrown through the drive-through serving hatch of a McDonald's by a gang of youths  

Staff were left shocked after the pranksters ordered a meal and paid for their food, only to not collect their order but to throw the animal through the hatch instead. 

Police and the RSPCA were called and the chicken was rescued by animal welfare officer Ron Crawford. 

The chicken was not harmed in the incident and has since been named Nugget. It will join Mr Crawford's flock of birds. 

John Lawson, RSPCA deputy chief inspector for Cleveland and County Durham, said: 'We would like to discourage people from repeating such pranks.

'Chickens are protected animals and are protected under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.

'To subject the animals to pranks such as this could be an offence.'

Police are looking for the pranksters who threw the chicken through the Wolviston Services serving hatch
