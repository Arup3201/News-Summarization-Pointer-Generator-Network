A prestigious Sydney school erected memorial gates for a teacher who was known to be a 'notorious molester' with the inscription 'he touched us all', an inquiry has been told.

Former Knox Grammar School student Scott Ashton, 44, told a royal commission hearing investigating how the Uniting Church and the private school responded to child abuse allegations, that he was left deeply confused by the tribute to the late Bruce Barrett.

Mr Ashton called the art teacher a 'notorious molester' while giving evidence to the commission on Tuesday, as he revealed the abuse he had personally suffered at Barrett's hands in the Wahroonga school's classrooms on Sydney's North Shore.

In his statement, read out by close friend Gretel Pinniger who is also known as the high profile Sydney dominatrix Madame Lash, Mr Ashton said Barrett would chase and tickle his students. 

He told the inquiry that Barrett would occasionally wear a red tie, announcing 'watch out boys, it's a red tie day' to signify someone would be canned that day.

On one occasion, he recalled being chased by the teacher who then requested he stay back after class. Fearing that he would be caned, Mr Ashton was instead sexually assaulted.

'I felt ashamed of my abuse. I was deeply ashamed and unable to discuss it with anyone,' Mr Ashton said in his statement, according to News Corp.

'It was an issue which I avoided because any reminder of it would cause me severe stress and interfered with my ability to function and cope on a day-to-day basis.'

Despite his notoriety, Mr Ashton said everyone at the school was expected to pay tribute to Barrett, who had died young.

'The fact that he was so well regarded by the school despite being a notorious molester made me feel very confused and powerless,' he said.

Mr Ashton said he was nine when he went to Knox and from the start he was abused 'openly and brazenly' by another teacher, Barrie Stewart.

He said the sexual abuse he suffered led him to become a teenage sex worker, according to the ABC. 

He described another incident in which he was inappropriately touched in sight of other staff and students in the playground, saying: 'It was so common I wasn't sure it was wrong for teachers to touch me like that.' 

In 2009, Stewart was convicted of five counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault. He was given a suspended sentence. 

Five former teachers have been convicted of sexual assault, however the inquiry has heard allegations against a further three staff members who have never been charged.
