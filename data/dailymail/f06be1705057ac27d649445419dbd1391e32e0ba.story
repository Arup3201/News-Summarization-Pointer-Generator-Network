Shame: Guy Marsden, nephew of the late Jimmy Savile, says his uncle's body should be exhumed and cremated

The nephew of paedophile Jimmy Savile has said that his uncle's body should be exhumed from its grave overlooking the North Sea.

Guy Marsden, son of Savile's sister Marjorie, thinks that the pervert should be removed from Scarborough cemetery and cremated.

Mr Marsden says other family members probably agree with him, adding it would spare anguish for victims or others who have loved-ones buried at Woodlands Cemetery, he told Sky News.

Mr Marsden said: 'If it is causing heartache and pain we would definitely go along with the people of Scarborough and the people whose loved ones are buried there.

'My own personal view, and I could say that of a lot of my family, would be that if it comes to it where he has to be moved, let's get it moved. Let's get it done.'

He has already told the Mail that his celebrity uncle attended ‘paedophile parties’ when he was 13 and Guy and his friends went to numerous events where he 
believes men sexually abused girls and boys as young as ten.

At the moment Savile is lying in an unmarked grave after his family requested his giant ornate headstone be removed out of respect for the hundreds he sexually abused.

All its inscriptions have been ground away and the stone smashed up and sent to landfill.

Several families of people buried in the council-owned cemetery say they do not want his body to remain in its prime position above all the other graves at the top of the hill.

Scarborough Cemetery isn’t a churchyard 
but Scarborough Borough Council officials have confirmed that the area 
where Jimmy Savile is buried is consecrated.

Permission to remove the body of the disgraced showbiz star would have to be granted by Church of England Judge Canon Peter Collier QC, who would have to weigh any 'potential benefit' against the 'Christian theology of the permanence of burial'.

Scarborough councillor, Colin Haddington, has also called for Savile’s corpse to be exhumed and then cremated at a nearby crematorium.

The Tory councillor said he had been contacted by a constituent whose 
granddaughter was buried close to Savile, which had caused her enormous 
concern and her family a great deal of distress.

'I was approached by one of my 
constituents who informed me that her granddaughter is buried in 
Woodlands Cemetery and unfortunately Jimmy Savile has been buried very 
close by this lady's granddaughter,' he said.

'This has caused a great deal of distress to her constituent and her family.

'I put it to the council today if Jimmy Savile's body could be exhumed or cremated.'

Grave: Bunches of flowers mark the grave of Sir Jimmy Savile after his headstone was removed in the middle of the night - and shows its view over the town and sea

Gone: The headstone was only put in place three weeks before it was removed last month - and he was buried at a 45 degree angle encased in concrete - his dying wish

Relation: Guy says that his family will agree that his uncle's body should be removed and cremated

He added that the response from the council was 'disappointing' but 
acknowledged the decision could only be made by Savile's family.

Savile's dying wish was to be encased in concrete and buried at an angle so he could 'see' the sea from his final resting place.

Memories: Guy, now 59, pictured at 8, says that his 'Uncle Jimmy' took him to parties where children were used for sex

But days after the details of his abuse broke, the gates of Woodlands Cemetery were locked at the dead of night and police stood guard for the two-hour operation to remove Savile's Scarborough grave.

His loved-ones did not attend and while they had ordered the removal of the grave they were not aware of the undertakers’ decision to do it in the middle of the night.

They were to wait until 7am before removing the six foot wide by four foot tall  headstone with Savile’s now inflammatory epitaph: 'It was good while it lasted.'

The Savile family said in a statement: 'Members of the family of Sir Jimmy Savile have decided to remove his headstone from the grave in Scarborough.

'The family members are deeply aware of the impact that the stone remaining there could have on the dignity and sanctity of the cemetery.

Meanwhile West Yorkshire Police confirmed today that Savile 'may' have been questioned by Ripper detectives.

A former detective who helped catch 
the Yorkshire Ripper made the shocking claim.

Former
West Yorkshire detective John Stainthorpe told ITV Yorkshire Calendar 
News that Savile was brought in for questioning after members of the 
public contacted the police naming the eccentric DJ as a possible 
killer.

The late Jimmy Savile, pictured in the 1970's working as a porter at Leeds General Infirmary, has been accused by his nephew of attending parties in London attended by children as young as ten

Mr Stainthorpe, who
worked for the West Yorkshire force for more than 40 years, and who 
spent years trying to catch Peter Sutcliffe, told the programme: 'When 
the Ripper was really active one of the suspects put forward by members 
of the public was Jimmy Savile, strange as it may seem.

Lawyers representing the disgraced DJ’s alleged victims said they have now notified his estate executors, the BBC and three hospitals that they plan to launch damages claims against them.

Three more cases are likely to be pursued against the BBC in the coming weeks, one lawyer said.

The former presenter’s £4 million estate has already been frozen by executor NatWest.

Law firm Pannone, which has been contacted by 46 of his alleged victims, says it has received 'firm instructions' to proceed with eight claims.Seven will be made against Savile’s estate and one will be launched against the BBC and his estate jointly.

All victims were aged between 10 and 13 when the alleged abuse took place in the late 1960s and 1970s.

Pannone lawyer Alan Collins said: 'I anticipate around three more against the BBC in the coming weeks.

'It’s very serious stuff. If Savile was alive and convicted, he’d be looking at a very long stretch in prison, if not life.'

He said they were receiving new complaints by the day, around 40% of which have been made by men.

And the West Yorkshire force did not rule it out.

'As with thousands of other men in Leeds at the time, he may at some time have been approached by detectives on the investigation.

'What is without doubt is that Savile was clearly not the Yorkshire Ripper.'

It came as an up and coming radio star says he lost his spot on the BBC after reporting vile Jimmy Savile’s abuse of young girls to bosses.

David Hardwick was a regular guest on Savile’s Speakeasy radio show in the early 1970s but that came to an abrupt end when he said he thought the DJ was a paedophile.

Mr Hardwick reported he had witnessed young teenage girls leaving Savile’s scruffy motor home in an isolated area of a service station more than 40 years ago.

But the power of Savile was such that David was told by BBC top brass to never mention the allegation again through fear that 'we could all lose our jobs.'

David, now 67 said: 'I told my friend and producer Roy Trevivian who passed it  up to the head of religious cultural programming at the time.

'I was called by Roy, who has since died, a few days after the allegation. I was told ‘we will not be looking into this because they are only suspicions and  because it is Jimmy Savile, it would be dangerous to do so, as we could all  lose our jobs.’

'That to me says Savile could do what he wanted while at the Beeb but they certainly can’t say they didn’t know about his abuse because I told them.'
