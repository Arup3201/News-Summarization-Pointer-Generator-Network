A former bank adviser said she helped her fiancé allegedly steal £123,000 from a customer’s account after fraudsters threatened to published naked photos of her online, a court has heard.

Aniysah Ali, 25, who was working at Halifax's North Finchley branch in north London, allegedly passed the confidential details to Salim Hussain, 29, and he could plunder Julian Masters’s bank account, along with others. 

But she claims she only agreed to help her 29-year-old partner after he was threatened by men about the compromising images in the weeks leading up to their wedding.

Former bank adviser Aniysah Ali, 25 (pictured), from Southall, says she only helped her fiancé allegedly steal £123,000 from a customer's account to stop fraudsters publishing naked photos of her online 

The photos, which Ali had sent in ‘sexts’ to a previous partner, had previously ended up on a Danish porn website, the jury was told.

Ali wept in the dock at the Old Bailey as she told how she was deserted by friends and family when the pictures of her posing naked without a headscarf were also added to a fake Facebook profile.

She told the jury: ‘The first time the photos were published it took me a long time to get over. Even now I’m not over it.

‘It is a very, very difficult subject. When he told me it was going to happen for a second time it made me even more scared because it would have involved Salim’s family and we would not be able to get married. They would have thought very bad of me.'

She added: ‘For me to know he could have been taken away from me at any point because of that, it frightened me, it scared me, and to know that he could have been hurt at the same time.’

The prosecution say there is no evidence that any such threats were made, but Ali said she had no reason to doubt her now ex-husband’s word.

Zain Hussain, 28, from Hounslow, west London, is also accused of fraud 

‘I would have believed anything Salim told me. That’s how relationships work,’ she said. 

Ali claimed it was only after those revelations that she agreed to check Mr Masters’s bank account.

The court has previously heard how the information was used to order a new debit card and PIN number, which were used to buy items including cars and jewellery.

Ali also allegedly helped to remove blocks on the account when the bank became suspicious of the unusual spending activity.

By the time the customer spotted the fraud, £123,000 in spending had already been approved. The bank declined another £114,000.

Ali then quit her job at the bank on May 29, 2012, one day before she was arrested at the Wembley branch.

In evidence, Ali claimed that receipts for cash payments found in her bag totalling more than £1,500 came from deposits Hussain had made to pay back loans.

She later told police her fiancé had been threatened by a man known as Raza Shah and co-defendant, 28-year-old Zain Hussain.

Ali told the jury: ‘He told me he was under threat. These people had been violent towards him.

‘There were people that would come to his house, people he would see at cricket and he would also tell me he was getting phone calls to his house.

Ali allegedly accessed Mr Masters’s account while in a private interview room at the bank on 16 April 2012, the court heard.

She changed the address on the account to one in Southall, west London, and ordered a new debit card and PIN number destined to fall into the hands of the fraudsters, the jury heard.

The card was blocked on a number of occasions between 21 April and 5 May 2012 because of the unusual spending pattern on the account.

The trial at the Old Bailey (pictured) previously heard how the confidential information was used to order a new debit card and PIN number, which were used to buy items including cars and jewellery

But information gleaned from the account allowed the fraudsters to phone the bank to remove the block, it is alleged.

Police found receipts from a local jewellery shop when they searched her Southall home, which she shared with Salim Hussain.

Checks at the shop revealed a forged utility bill had been used in conjunction with the debit card to make fraudulent purchases, the jury heard.

Other successful transactions included the purchase of two cars, for £7,950 and £6,900.

Ali and Salim, both of Tentelow Lane, Southall, and Zain Hussain, of The Avenue, Hounslow, west London, all deny fraud by false representation.

Ali also denies fraud by abuse of position between 27 March 2012 and 30 May 2012.

The trial continues.
