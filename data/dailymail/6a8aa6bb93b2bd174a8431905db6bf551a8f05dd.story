Charges have been filed against five suspected bullies accused of dumping a bucket of urine, tobacco and spit on an autistic teen who thought he was taking part in the ice bucket challenge for charity.

Each of the five teens was charged in juvenile court with disorderly conduct. Three were also charged with delinquency and assault. The teens, who range in age from 14 to 16, were not named..

According to a press release from Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty, the underage suspects and the special-needs victim were friends who regularly socialized together. They attend Bay High School in suburban Cleveland.

Getting their just desserts: This 15-year-old autistic boy from Ohio agreed to take the ALS ice bucket challenge, not knowing that the teens who asked him to do it were playing a sick prank on him; now, his tormentors have been charged

Humiliating: Standing in his underwear outside a garage, the teen was doused with a mixture of urine, feces, saliva and cigarette butts

Authorities say the teen felt humiliated when he discovered that it was urine and other bodily fluids dumped on him instead of ice water. 

The 15-year-old boy was filmed on August 18 standing under a garage in his underwear before the bucket of brown slurry was tipped on his head from off-screen.

The clip, filmed in Bay Village in Ohio, sparked an outcry when it emerged in early September, prompting appeals to track down those responsible.

Now, the three teens facing more serious charges will have to come to the local police station to surrender and be booked. They will then be released pending an initial court appearance.

The other two suspects will be summoned to appear before the Juvenile Court Intake and Diversion Office. 

Cyber-bullying: The teen's tormentors used his cell phone to record the prank and upload it onto Instagram 

First Assistant County Prosecutor Duane Deskins stated in the press release that the sick ice bucket challenge 'crossed a moral and legal line, and even the five alleged perpetrators understand that and have expressed regret.'

The victim's family have been consulted and they agree with the charges, according to the prosecutors.  

The sickening video of the prank was filmed on the victim's own mobile phone and then posted to the Instagram social network.

According to the boy's mother, who gave her name only as Diane so as to protect her son's identity, the victim was so embarrassed by the cruel prank that he wanted to keep it a secret.

But when his family discovered the clip, they decided to share it more widely to raise awareness of how he had been bullied.

Diane told the Fox8 news station last month that the bullies had perverted the charitable aims of the Ice Bucket Challenge - which is meant to raise cash and awareness for ALS, a muscle-wasting disease.

She said: 'The bucket challenge is supposed to be raising awareness for this disease and now they’ve turned it into a sick joke. I just can’t understand why kids would do something this cruel.’
