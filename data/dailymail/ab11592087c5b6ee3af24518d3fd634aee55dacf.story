Charmaine King's bruised and bloodied face after she was set upon outside a bar in Poole, Dorset, on Boxing Day

This is the bruised and bloodied face of a young mother after she was the victim of a late night attack.

Charmaine King's injuries were so horrific that her own two-year-old daughter was left scared to go near her.

The 22-year-old now fears she has been left scarred for life after she was punched in the face with a set of car keys.

Miss King had just got out of a taxi near Yate's Wine Bar in Poole, Dorset, when she became embroiled in an argument with a woman.

During the row she was punched in the face by a man who was holding a set of car keys. 

The mother-of-one was left with a deep two-inch long gash above her right eyebrow and doctors think that her eye socket may have been fractured. 

She was taken to hospital where doctors had to cut off her fur headband and give her seven stitches.

Medics told her the cut would leave a permanent scar above her right eye.

Miss King's two-year-old daughter Lacey was initially too scared to go near her mother after seeing the horrific injuries.

Miss King, a qualified beauty therapist, said: 'I very rarely go out, I work a lot to support my daughter and this was the first time I had been out in ages.

'I had only just got out of the taxi to go into the bar when it happened. I just fell to the floor and my friend had to pick me up.

'I was in shock and pain and having a bit of a panic attack but I didn't realise how bad it was until I got to the hospital and they had to cut my headband off.

'They think he had his keys in his hand because it's such a clean cut. It's very deep and they told me it will leave a scar.

'My daughter wouldn't go anywhere near me at first because my injury looked so awful.

'She wouldn't give me a cuddle and now she's scared she'll hurt me if she touches my face.

'It completely ruined our Christmas and made me too scared to leave the house.'

Dorset Police said a 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm and has been released on bail.
