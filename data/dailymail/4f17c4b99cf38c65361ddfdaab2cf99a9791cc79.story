Prince Charles proved that he's more than just a pretty face today, when he turned his hand to veterinary work during a visit to a Caithness college today.

Wielding a stethoscope like a pro, the royal was shown how to listen for heart problems with a little help from a Jack Russell dog named Jasper.

And not content with helping one animal, the Prince of Wales - or the Duke of Rothesay as he's known north of the border -Â  went on to repeat the trick with dapple grey highland pony Matthew.

Clearly at ease with horses, he looked relaxed and happy as he chatted with Matthew's handler Alastair Maitheson and gave the feisty pony a pat.

Charles' close encounter with the animal kingdom came as he toured North Highland College in Halkirk during a flying one-day trip to the north.

The college, which currently has around 8,000 students on its books, specialises in country skills, with game keeping and veterinary courses among those on offer.

Prince Charles, while no vet, is no stranger to country concerns and employs several game keepers and farm managers of his own.

A passionate advocate of all things organic, he also runs a sustainable farming summer school on his Highgrove Estate.

Unfortunately for the prince, he hasn't had a lot of time to spend at his Gloucestershire home in recent weeks, courtesy of a packed schedule that has seen him traverse the country.

Yesterday, his day began at a Norfolk flower show with the Duchess of Cornwall, before he rushed north to meet workers at GCHQ Scarborough.

There, he was shown one of the original Enigma machines ahead of a tour of the site, which includes a small museum, and a plaque unveiling ceremony.
