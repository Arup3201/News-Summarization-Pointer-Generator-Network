Nadia, 26, was born to a Lebanese father and American mother and fled her family home in Florida when she was 22 to relocate to New York.

As well as working in a mundane office job, the size 16 star started a fashion blog and quickly garnered thousands of followers.

She now works full-time as a blogger and earns money from advertising and campaigns. 

She has adorned the glossy pages of Italian Vogue, Lucky magazine and worked for American Apparel.

And now, in perhaps her most exciting coup to date, she's been snapped up by boohooPLUS to design a plus-size range for the e-tailer.

The brand first meet Nadia during a trip to New York and have worked together ever since, but it was during a recent photo shoot when the idea of creating a co-branded collection was hatched.

The 20-piece trend led capsule wardrobe was created by Nadia and boohoo’s design team at the brand's HQ in Manchester - and now they've given FEMAIL a sneak peek. 

Speaking about the range, which lands on March 23, Nadia said: 'It has been such an amazing experience working with boohoo, they encourage me to be as creative as possible and I really appreciate that. 

'The collection is inspired by my personal style; minimal androgynous with a touch of glamour, it’s all about body confidence and feeling strong in what you wear.'

Championing on-trend fashion for all sizes, the Nadia Aboulhosn for boohoo capsule collection is set on a monochrome colour palette with pops of powder blue and cobalt with key pieces such as the blazer dress, the logo jumpsuit and the cut out asymmetrical two-piece. The collection aims to embrace and celebrate women with body confidence.

A spokesperson for the e-tailer said: 'We are constantly striving to deliver the latest trends and key price points to our customers, so after the successful launch of boohooPLUS last year, a collaboration was a natural development. 

'This is the ultimate body confidence collection, combining new shapes with cut out detailing to create an iconic range designed and modelled by  ambassador, Nadia Aboulhosn.'

Nadia proves that fashion choices shouldn't be limited by size and her street style outfits are testament to that.

She can been seen rocking bralette tops with high-waisted skirts, sheer skirts, plunging V-necks, and super skinny jeans on her website.

Lookalike? Nadia bares a striking resemblance to Kim Kardashian, right

Part of her appeal is that she doesn't take herself too seriously - and she's keen to show the real her on social media.

Her Instagram snaps include her wearing a nose strip and bleaching her facial hair, with the caption: “Face hair bleach and blackhead session, followed by shaving 95 per cent of my overly hairy half-Arab body.'

Another shows her imitating Nicki Minaj’s ­Anaconda lap dance on her cat, and others show her devouring fast food.

Speaking to The Telegraph, she explained: 'I take pictures of me going to McDonalds. I make it a point to show I’m still eating oodles of noodles. I think that’s why people can relate to me.'
