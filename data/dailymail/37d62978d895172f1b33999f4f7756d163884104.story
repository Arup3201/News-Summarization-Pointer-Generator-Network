A hospital worker who injured her shoulders and neck when pulling curtains around a patient's bed has been awarded £50,000 in compensation.

Linda Mitchell, 59, was given the payout following the accident at Belford Hospital, Fort William, which left her unable to return to work for the last four years.

The nursing auxiliary said that the injury could have been avoided if managers had acted on previous complaints that were made by her colleagues.

Compensation: Linda Mitchell, an auxiliary nurse from Fort William, was awarded £50,000 by NHS Highland after injuring her neck and shoulders drawing a curtain around a patient's bed at the Belford Hospital (pictured)

The health board denied liability, claiming an inspection found there were no defects in the curtains.

They
initially offered Ms Mitchell compensation of £25,000, which was 
rejected, and the settlement was doubled after a civil action.

'My
case was dealt with quickly and easily and I was very happy with the 
outcome,' said Ms Mitchell, from the village of Caol near Fort William.

'If previous complaints about the faulty curtains hadn't been ignored my accident could have been avoided.'

Ms Mitchell was working in ward two of the hospital, known as Belhaven Ward, when she tried to pull the curtains.

To
do so she had to lean over a table which had a television on top of it.
The heavy-lined curtains jammed, wrenching her shoulder and back.

Patrick
McGuire, a partner with specialist trade union lawyers Thompsons, said:
'This was a straightforward case of an individual being injured at work
due to an employer not taking the correct care and precaution to 
protect staff from injury.'

A
spokeswoman for the law firm added: 'A number of her colleagues have 
confirmed that there were problems with the curtains prior to Linda's 
accident.

Settlement: The Court of Session in Edinburgh where Ms Mitchell's claim was settled. She has been unable to work since the incident in September 2008

'A staff nurse had advised that she had previously complained about the difficulty with the curtains and another nurse who advised that she had reported problems with the curtains.'

Highland and Islands MSP Mary Scanlon said: 'This is £50,000 that will not go into patient care but rather into compensation.

'I hope it will be a lesson to NHS Highland to pay closer attention to complaints and health and safety issues.'

Ms Mitchell launched a civil action 
against NHS Highland at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on the advice 
of her union, Unison.
