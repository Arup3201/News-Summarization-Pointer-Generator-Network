GP out-of-hours firms are putting patients at risk by hiring doctors without checking they are competent, according to the NHS watchdog.

The Care Quality Commission identified safety concerns at four out of ten organisations which included doctors being allowed to use faulty equipment and ineffective medicines.

One firm responsible for the care of 154,000 patients in Essex admitted hiring locum GPs without checking they were competent nor if had a criminal record.

Managers at South Essex Emergency Doctors employed medics they knew nothing about and failed to even ask for references from their previous employers.

Other firms were found to be putting patients at risk by allowing doctors to use potentially faulty equipment and unsafe medicines.

Out-of-hours GP services have been under scrutiny ever since 2008 when pensioner David Gray died at the hands of an incompetent German locum GP Daniel Ubani.

Dr Ubani - who was exhausted after flying in for his first shift - prescribed the 70 year old ten times the legal dose of morphine.

It later emerged that the out of hours firm, Take Care Now, based in Cambridgeshire, had failed to carry out basic checks on his competence nor ability to speak English before employing him.

The CQC is currently inspecting all major out of hours firms in England and this Summer will give each one a rating of ranging from excellent to poor.

It has just published the findings of its first round of inspections into ten organisations which found that four were potentially unsafe.

They include South Essex Emergency Doctors - based at two centres in Basildon hospital and Thurrock hospital - which hired locums without carrying out criminal records checks nor asking to see references from previous employers.

The CQC’s inspection report said there ‘was a risk that unsuitable doctors might be employed by the service to deliver patient care.’

Another, M Doc Limited, which runs out of hours services for 88,000 patients around Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, kept medicines in a faulty fridge meaning they might not work.

And the Partnership of East London Co-operative, (PELC), which is responsible for out-of-hours care for 1.1 million patients in East London, allowed GPs to use equipment such as stethoscopes which could be unhygienic and faulty.

Inspectors also found the firm was storing medicines in areas where they could be tampered with or potentially stolen by drug addicts.

Jamie Reed MP, Labour’s shadow health minister, said: ‘Patients will be concerned to hear about these failings. The reports risk driving even more patients to turn to A&E out of fear, when hospitals have already had their worst year in a decade.

‘This is indisputable proof that NHS services are going downhill on David Cameron’s watch. He wasted billions on a reorganisation that nobody wanted and placed NHS finances on a knife-edge.

‘Under this Government, care problems are becoming more likely, not less.

‘Ministers must get a grip - patients deserve reliable alternatives to A&E.’

But health secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘Inevitably when you impose a more rigorous inspection regime you uncover more problems but it is in the best interests of patients to acknowledge where there is poor care instead of trying to cover it up.

‘Labour made the disastrous decision to abolish expert led inspections which we have now reversed.’

The CQC is currently inspecting 36 major out-of-hours organisations and is due to publish a report on its findings in June.

Chief Inspector of General Practice, Professor Steve Field, who is overseeing them said: ‘These inspections mark the first phases in the changes that we are making to inspections of primary medical services, the results of these first inspections show that some services are serving their communities well but others still have some work to do.

‘We’ll take what we have learned from these first inspections to help us develop and improve the process.’
