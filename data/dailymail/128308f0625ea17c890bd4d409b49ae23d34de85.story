Crystal Palace have added another player to their ranks by bringing in former striker Andrew Johnson on a free transfer.

The 33-year-old has signed a deal which will see him ply his trade in south London until January.

Johnson, who has played for Everton, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers since leaving Selhurst Park, left the Eagles in 2006.

Johnson joined Palace from Birmingham in 2002 and went on to become a fans' favourite as he helped the club win promotion in 2004. 

He then scored 21 goals in the top flight the following season, bringing him his first call-up for England, however he could not prevent Palace from suffering relegation.

Johnson, speaking to Crystal Palace's official website, said on his return: 'I am delighted to be coming back to a club that I love and have a real soft spot for. 

'I would like to thank the gaffer and the chairman for giving me this opportunity and I am looking forward to helping this football club have continued success in the Premier League.

'I have also been given an opportunity to help the youngsters in a coaching capacity, something I am really looking forward to getting involved in.' 

Johnson, who has been named in Crystal Palace's 25-man Premier League squad, left Selhurst Park for Everton in 2006 for a fee of £8.5million.

Neil Warnock’s ninth signing of the summer sees veteran English striker Andrew Johnson return to his former stomping ground.

Johnson is remembered fondly by Palace fans after a successful spell with the Eagles from 2002 to 2006, where the former English international scored 74 goals in 140 appearances.

Starting his Palace career with a bang, Johnson bagged a hat-trick against rivals Brighton & Hove Albion and then followed his goalscoring heroics up with another against Walsall in the next game.

Topping the First Division Football League goal scoring charts in 2003/04 season with 32 goals, Johnson became a revelation at the club under the guidance of manager Iain Dowie.

The following season, Johnson helped Palace achieve promotion to the Premier League with a 1-0 win over West Ham at Wembley. This was a major achievement for the club, as just five months before the play-off game, Palace were 19th in the league and under serious threat of relegation.

In 2005, Palace fans were asked to vote which players would make it into a ‘Centenery XI’ for the club. Johnson was voted in to the team beating 10 other strikers who were also shortlisted.
