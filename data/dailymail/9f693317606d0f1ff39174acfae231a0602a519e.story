Record-breaking Indian-American astronaut Sunita Williams has taken command of the InternationalSpace Station, becoming the second woman in history to do so.

Williams, who now holds three records for female space travellers, took over as a three-member crew of the Expedition 32 returned safely to earth, wrapping up a mission that lasted more than four months.

The three-man crew on board a Russian-made Soyuz capsule touched down successfully in central Kazakhstan steppe on Monday morning after spending 123 days at the space station.

Giant leap: Sunita Williams is only the second woman astronaut ever to take charge of the International Space Station

Just after the Soyuz spacecraft separated from the space station on Sunday, NASA astronaut Williams took over the charge of Expedition 33 at the station from Commander Gennady Padalka.

The only other woman to have attained the feat was Peggy Whitson, who commanded the orbiting lab’s Expedition 16 mission between 2007 and 2008.

Williams, 46, will be sharing the space station with veteran Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malen chenko and Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide until mid-October, when three more astronauts, including NASA’s Kevin Ford, will arrive and round off the full crew of Expedition 33.

“I would like to thank our (Expedition) 32 crew mates here who have taught us how to live and work in space, and of course to have a lot of fun up in space,” Williams told Padalka during a change of command ceremony.

On September 6, Williams had set a new record for total spacewalk time by a female astronaut with her sixth space walk to repair a power distribution unit. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours 28 minutes.

Williams has now worked outside the station for a total of 44 hours and 2 minutes.
