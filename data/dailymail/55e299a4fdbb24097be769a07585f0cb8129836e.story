Speaker Bercow's remarks drew a furious reaction from some fellow politicians

John Bercow was at the centre of a storm last night after claiming migrants work harder than the British.

The Commons Speaker said the arrival of thousands of migrants from Eastern Europe has had great advantages for Britain.

He spoke of an ‘important wave’ of people that have come in recent years and praised their work ethic over that of the British.

The remarks raised questions about the strict political neutrality required from his office and led to an accusation that he had behaved ‘disgracefully’.

Speaking on a visit to the Romanian parliament in Bucharest, Mr Bercow said: ‘I believe things should be controlled and monitored when it comes to migration – any state that wants to protect its own people should do this – but there are also great advantages.

‘I want to underline the fact that there has been an important wave of immigrants that came to Great Britain from new member states and in many cases they came with aptitudes and a commitment, an involvement we haven’t always seen in our labour force.’

The remarks drew a furious reaction from some fellow  politicians, including Nigel Farage, the UK Independence Party leader who challenged Mr Bercow at the last election.

Last night he said: ‘It is outrageous that Mr Bercow is happy to overthrow the wisdom of ages and think it acceptable to comment on matters that are both highly political and deeply contentious. He is a disgrace to the office of Speaker.

‘There are very good practical and constitutional reasons why the Speaker is neutral, reasons that he obviously believes are beneath his own august self image.’

The Speaker criticised sections of the media for raising questions about immigration, claiming there had been negative and discriminatory reporting on the issue.

He suggested media coverage of immigration did not reflect the views of Parliament or the Government.

‘A free media is a vital part of a democracy,’ he added. ‘But the media is not the Government and it is not Parliament. I am here as a friend of Romania and someone who sees the benefits of immigration.’

Nigel Farage said Bercow was 'a disgrace to the office of Speaker'

Rob Wilson, a Conservative MP who has previously questioned Mr Bercow’s political bias, said: ‘Immigration is an incredibly important and sensitive matter that generates very strong opinions.

‘The Speaker needs not only to be neutral in his handling of debates on the issue, but he needs to be seen to be neutral.

‘It would be a dangerous precedent if a Speaker were to start airing their views too freely on a subject like this.’

However Philip Hollobone, a Conservative MP who has criticised loose immigration rules, said he did not object to Mr Bercow’s remarks.

He said: ‘As Speaker of the House of Commons, it is absolutely right that if he is asked a question, he is able to answer it freely and honestly.’

Ministers have promised a series of measures designed to limit the scale of immigration from Romania and Bulgaria when transitional controls are lifted in the New Year, including limits on rights of incomers to claim benefits and use the NHS or other public services.
