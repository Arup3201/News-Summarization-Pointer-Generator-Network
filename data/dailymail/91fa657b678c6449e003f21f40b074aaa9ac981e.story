On September 2, 2013, when Gareth Bale was presented to more than 30,000 spectators inside the Bernabeu, he stood before them, smiling awkwardly, desperately trying to recollect those Spanish phrases he memorised.

A few sentences in the local lingo – all in that recognisable Welsh accent – and his romantic introduction to Spanish football was official. ‘Hala Madrid,’ he yelled, and a roar replied.

Yet the patience £86million buys you comes with an expiration date, it seems.

Even winning the Champions League, Copa del Rey, FIFA Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup in less than 18 months doesn’t make you immune to those Spanish whistles.

They weren’t deafening. Far from it. But they were there, loud enough to discern. The thing is, the Bernabeu boo boys can be the harshest critics in football.

Maybe it’s a rite of passage.

Alfredo di Stefano, a Real Madrid legend in every sense of the word, was whistled on occasion. So, too, was Zinedine Zidane. There was also Manuel Velazquez, Rafael Martin Vazquez, Michel, Emilio Butragueno, and, more recently, Iker Casillas.

Even the great Alfredo Di Stefano (right), seen here with Raymond Kopa and the European Cup in 1957, was not immune to the Bernabeu boo boys

Zinedine Zidane, who helped Real win their ninth European Cup in 2002, was also booed on occasion

Even Cristiano Ronaldo has been subject to it. Whistling and booing let rip in the 76th minute against Rayo Vallecano on March 29, 2014 – when Real Madrid were already 4-0 up – because the former Manchester United great did not pass to Alvaro Morata.

Spanish newspaper Marca dedicated a story to it headlined: ‘Ball hogger.’ Carlo Ancelotti was flabbergasted. ‘I understand booing every now and then when we have deserved it,’ the manager began, before adding: ‘But booing Cristiano is not so easy to understand.’

It meant the world's most expensive signing ended his first season as a European champion

Bale also helped Real lift the European Super Cup against Sevilla in his home city of Cardiff in August 

Even Rafa Nadal – yes, the tennis player – chipped in: ‘It wasn’t right. The problem with sport, and with life, is that you can go from 0 to 100, and 100 to 0 in days. Real looked like they were going to win the league and three days later everything is a disaster.’

He had a point. Tensions were high. They had gone 31 games unbeaten, only to lose 4-3 against Barcelona then 2-1 against Sevilla.

But to boo a man with 28 goals in 27 appearances in La Liga? Perhaps that demonstrates how callous the Bernabeu can be, even when 4-0 up in front of a depleted 60,174 attendance. A tough crowd.

Chances created - 25 (joint 17th in La Liga)

Assists - 5 (joint 6th in La Liga)

Bale is in illustrious company, then. Yet the reports in Spain – that he is the latest to be hounded – exaggerate. Is the only Brit at the Bernabeu an easy target?

Being the world’s most expensive footballer brings expectation, and Bale has not met them this year. Nowhere near, in fact. Compare him to his fellow forwards – Ronaldo, James Rodriguez, Isco, and Karim Benzema – and Bale is far off.

His shooting accuracy (51.72 per cent) is the worst. He’s made the least passes (508) – this particular statistic far from helping the ‘selfish’ tag bestowed upon him – and has had just 287 touches of the ball. Even Isco has had 1,264 in 329 fewer minutes played.

Assists this year? Bale (5) is joint sixth in La Liga. That’s still less than Ronaldo (9), James (7), Isco (7) and Benzema (8).

Turn to chances created, and Bale (25) is joint 17th. Way behind Lionel Messi (55), James (49), Toni Kroos (44) and Ronaldo (43). Even Isco (29) and Marcelo (25) have as many.

Ronaldo is enjoying an exceptional season, having scored 36 goals in 31 matches across all competitions

Colombian star James Rodriguez has also been out-performing Bale in many areas this season

Barcelona's Lionel Messi is leading the way in terms of chances created in the Spanish league

This dip in form hasn't helped the talking points.

Against Valencia on January 4, Bale could and should have passed to Benzema. He didn’t, the criticism built, and Real’s 22-match winning streak ended in a 2-1 defeat.

Ronaldo, the man caught winking at the 2006 World Cup following Wayne Rooney’s dismissal, should know those pesky cameras don’t miss a thing. He was beamed around the world, hands on hips, shaking his head, huffing and puffing in disapproval.

Then, against Espanyol on January 10, Bale failed to assist Ronaldo in a two-on-one chance. The three-time Ballon d’Or winner’s body language said it all, even though they were 2-0 up at the time.

‘Why. Did. You. Not. Pass,’ Spanish newspaper AS tweeted, before labelling him ‘ball hog Bale’ on their front page the day after.

There have been occasions this season when Bale could have chosen a better pass 

Yet we should note, since Bale moved to Madrid on September 1, 2013, he has assisted Ronaldo eight times. Vice versa, Ronaldo has set Bale up just once, against Malaga on November 29, 2014.

Bale was asked how he had the audacity to shoot against Espanyol. ‘All I can remember is that I was going through on goal and I wanted to score,’ he told El Larguero. A forward doing what a forward should.

And so to their 4-1 win over Real Sociedad on January 31, when Bale took the ball off James – 12 yards out with goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli in no man's land – and missed. The criticism grew. Even on Wednesday, in a 2-1 win over Sevilla, he was scrutinised. Another two-on-one scenario squandered, apparently.

The opening exchanges of Ancelotti’s press conference in the aftermath were spent discussing Bale. The Real Madrid manager answered: ‘That again? The run was fantastic and at the end he took the right decision. I can’t ask any more of him.’

We forget in between all this Ronaldo was sent off for his violent outburst, and Bale was relied upon to score an 89th-minute penalty to beat Cordoba. There when needed.

So, is this a dead debate?

This is a guy that left Marc Bartra in his dust in the Copa del Rey final to beat Barcelona with a 60-metre dash at 16.7mph. The man that helped win La Decima – their 10th European Cup – with a nod of the head. The player that upheld the tradition of British wingers scoring on their Real Madrid debut, emulating Laurie Cunningham and David Beckham.

Sportsmail’s Pete Jenson reminded us last week of a well-known sketch on Monty Python’s Life of Brian that can relate. It goes: ‘Apart from the sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?’

Those at the Bernabeu should ask themselves that same question with Bale.

September 1, 2013: Bale signs for Real Madrid for a world record fee of £86million

May 24: The former Spurs man scores a goal in extra time in the Champions League final, which Madrid go on to win 4-1... it's a record 10th European title for the Spanish side

August 12: Bale's third trophy at Madrid - the European Super Cup. He sets up the first of Ronaldo's two goals in his home city of Cardiff

December 20: Another trophy for the Welshman, and a goal in this final too. Real Madrid beat San Lorenzo 2-0 to win the FIFA Club World Cup, with Bale netting the second

December 23: Reports surface of a potential exit, and 54 per cent of Real Madrid fans would be happy to see him leave for the right price
