David Shacklefield was allowed to keep his licence despite ignoring a red light 

A white van man has been allowed to keep his driving licence despite racing over a level crossing after the traffic lights had turned red. 

David Shackleford claims he did not have enough time to stop the vehicle after realising the lights had changed at the crossing in Foxton, Cambridgeshire, so decided it would be safer to speed over the tracks. 

The 28-year-old trainee truck driver was moments away from colliding with a train, but has been allowed to keep his licence after pleading with magistrates. 

The driver from Harrow, north west London, was fined £200 and given three points for the incident on January 15. 

After initially claiming he the lights were on amber, the driver admitted he ignored them after being sent images taken from CCTV footage which clearly show him in plain view of the red light. 

But Judge Ken Sheraton decided not to disqualify Shackleford, as it would put him out of work. 

'I was driving at 40mph and it would have been unsafe for me to slam the breaks on.

'By the time the lights came into view it would have been silly for me to stop.'

It is not the first time drivers have had a near miss with oncoming trains at the crossing in Cambridgeshire.   

In 2010 John McDonald, 38, ignored the flashing warning lights and accelerated his 44-tonne sewage truck over the crossing.

The driver was filmed approaching the crossing while the lights are red despite claiming they were amber 

Shacklefield accelerated over the train lines just moments before a train thundered by at the crossing in Cambridgeshire 

The automatic barriers smashed as they crashed on top of the artic.

Two years later Belal Ahmed, 32, was convicted of speeding under the dropping barriers in the BMW, and ten days after that Girish Babu, 31, stopped his Mercedes on the crossing, forcing the signalman to stop the barriers in mid-air.

Sgt Andy Cook of British Transport Police said: 'Misusing level crossings is extremely dangerous and will not be tolerated by BTP.

'Drivers who ignore the warning lights and barriers don’t just risk their own lives, but also endanger other road users and rail passengers and staff.'
