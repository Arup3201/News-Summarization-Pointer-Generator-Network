Personal? A study in Philadelphia has found each person interprets smells differently

It is an age-old problem. Why is it so difficult to buy perfume for a loved one?

Well, scientists may have come up with the answer - but it doesn’t make picking a gift any easier.

We all think we know how certain things smell.

But to someone else that same bottle of perfume - or piece of cheese, or glass of wine - may smell completely differently.

American scientists have discovered that we all experience odours in a completely different way.

Their paper, published in the Nature Neuroscience journal, reveals that 30 per cent of smell receptors differ between any two people.

Each single receptor can alter the way each person perceives an odour.

Dr Joel Mainland, a molecular biologist at the Monell Chemical Senses Centre in Philadelphia, said: ‘For different items there is a big gap between what you smell and what I smell.

‘The amount of variation was really surprising to us - it was about 30 per cent of receptors are different between two individuals at random. That is a pretty high number.’

The human nose contains 400 different olfactory receptors - and Dr Mainland’s team found that changing a single receptor could dramatically change the way a person perceives a smell.

Good or bad? While some detect the aromatic smell of sandalwood from a scented candle, others smell it as pee

Dr Mainland said: ‘The activation pattern
 of these 400 receptors encodes both the intensity of an odour and the 
quality – for example, whether it smells like vanilla or smoke – for the
 tens of thousands of different odours that represent everything we 
smell.’

Changing one particular receptor meant 
that some people smell a specific type of steroid as a pleasant 
sandalwood - while others thought it smells like pee.

‘It is very different,’ Dr Mainland said.

‘One person might find it to be mild and pleasant and by changing that single receptor another might find it to be as a very strong and urinous.’

The researchers cloned 511 receptors and embedded them in host cells in the laboratory.

They then measured how each receptor responded to a panel of 73 different odours.

The process identified 28 different ways that each array of receptors would respond to the different odours.

The team used mathematical models to extrapolate the findings, and came up with the result that 140 of their 400 receptors - about 30 per cent - of any two individuals would be different.

Dr Mainland said the results may enable scientists to accurately create different smells.

‘The long-term goal is to figure out how the receptors encode odour molecules well enough that we can actually create any odour we want by manipulating the receptors directly.’
