Three people have been killed and 11 injured after a 21-year-old allegedly went on the rampage through the tourist district on the tropical island of Guam.

A 51-year-old man, named by a Japan Foreign Ministry official as Hitoshi Yokota, was rushed to Guam Memorial Hospital in critical condition after the incident on Tuesday but died this morning.

Chad Ryan De Soto, 21, from Tamuning, is accused of plowing into several people with his gray 
Toyota Yaris before getting out a knife and stabbing several victims on Tuesday.

Arrested: Chad Ryan Desoto, 21, of Tamuning, Guam, left, is in police custody after after allegedly driving a Toyota Yaris through a crowd of people in the island's visitor district in Tumon

It is alleged he drove onto a sidewalk and into a 
convenience store at the Outrigger hotel in the Tumon district injuring six people.

Authorities say he then got out of his car and started stabbing people 
he came across - injuring a further eight victims. 

Two Japanese women stabbed to death are believed to be 81-year-old Kazuko Uehara and 29-year-old Rie Sugiyama.

Those injured with De Soto's knife 
included Sugiyama's 8-month-old son. The baby is being treated in hospital and is in a stable 
condition.

Spokesman Tony Muna of the Guam Visitors Bureau said four victims remain hospitalized in the U.S. territory.

Aftermath: Guam Police Department officers secure the scene after three people were killed and 11 injured in a rampage in Guam

A 51-year-old woman is in a 'guarded' condition while a 70-year-old woman and two girls - a 3-month-old and an 8-month-old - are all in a stable condition.

A 22-year-old woman also in stable condition has been transferred to a hospital in Japan, while six patients were treated and released.

Prosecutors claim the suspect committed  the 'heinous, extreme' violence rarely seen in Guam - a tropical island about 1,500 miles south of Tokyo that is heavily dependent on tourism.

Superior Court Magistrate Judge Alberto Tolentino appointed a public defender to represent De Soto.

A video of the brief court proceedings posted online by the Pacific Daily News shows De Soto, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, telling Tolentino he has no job.

De Soto told police he wanted to hurt as many people as he could, first with his car and then with his knife, according to a declaration filed by Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Quan.

De Soto is charged with two counts of aggravated murder, for which he faces 15 years to life in prison. He also faces a charge of attempted aggravated murder for using a knife to attack Sugiyama's baby, and eight counts of aggravated assault.

A Guam judge ordered De Soto held on $2 million bail.

It appeared that most of the people injured in Tuesday's attack were Japanese tourists.

Guam is well-known for scuba diving, white beaches and historic World War II battle sites, and it depends heavily on tourism - particularly from Japan - for its economy.

Japanese people accounted for 73 per cent of the 1.1 million visitors to Guam in the 2011 fiscal year, according to Guam Visitors Bureau data. South Koreans made up 13 per cent, followed by 4 per cent from Taiwan.
