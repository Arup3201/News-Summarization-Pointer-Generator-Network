Three Oregon men  have been charged with attempted murder among a slew of other charges over the shooting outside a Portland high school that left four people injured.

Marquise Murphy, 16, Marquel Dugas, 18, and Lonzo Murphy, 22, have each been charged with attempted murder, first-degree assault, four counts of unlawful use of a weapon, and four counts of second-degree assault in the Dec. 12 shooting that occurred outside of Rosemary Anderson High School, KOIN reports.

Brother: Marquise Murphy (photographed) is the brother of Lonzo Murphy and the 16-year-old will be charged as an adult on both the attempted murder and first-degree assault charges 

Gang: Police believe the December 12 shooting was gang-related, and two of the victims had gang affiliations (photographed is the scene following the shooting)

Dugas and Lonzo Murphy are also facing additional charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm, and Murphy is also charged with tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution in the shooting that police believe was 'gang-related.'

Marquise Murphy will be charged as an adult on both the attempted murder and first-degree assault charges.

Authorities say that the violence erupted following a dispute at the alternative high school, Yahoo News reports. No information regarding what the dispute was about has surfaced.

The three men were previously held on probation violations pending an investigation into the incident. Each were arrested in the days following the shooting, Fox 12 reports. 

Wounded: Photographed are two of the victims, Taylor Zimmers, 16 (left), was taken to a hospital after being critically wounded in the shooting and Olyvia Batson, 17 (right), suffered a graze and was treated at the scene

Victims: Two of the four victims, La’Braye Franklin, 17 (left), and David Jackson-Liday, 2o, (right) had gang affiliations with police designating Jackson-Liday a gang member and Franklin was known to a gang unit

Dispute: Police say the violence erupted following a dispute outside of the Rosemary Anderson High School

The four victims were  La’Braye Franklin, 17; Taylor Zimmers, 16; David  Jackson-Liday, 20; and Olyvia Batson, 17. All survived. 

Batson was grazed by a bullet and treated at the scene, but the other three victims were hospitalized, with Zimmers critically wounded, according to Fox.

Survived: All four victims survived; three of the four were hospitalized but have since been discharged

Alternative: Rosemary Anderson High School (photographed) is an alternative school for 'at-risk' students, many of which are homeless or have been expelled or dropped out of other schools

The three have since been discharged from the hospital, police say. 

KOIN reports that police previously designated Jackson-Liday a gang member and Franklin had been known by a local gang unit. 

Rosemary Anderson HS is an alternative school for 'at-risk' students, many of which are homeless or have been expelled or dropped out of other schools, according to the school's website. 

The three suspects will be arraigned in court on Tuesday.
