Willy Sagnol's fine start to life as Bordeaux manager continued with a resounding 4-1 victory over ambitious Monaco at the Stade Chaban-Delmas.

The former France defender - still only 37 - guided Les Girondins to an opening-weekend win at Montpellier and watched his side take a share of the Ligue 1 lead after Monaco fell apart in the second half of action on Sunday night.

Dimitar Berbatov had given last year's runners-up the lead just before the break with a diving header but Diego Rolan levelled shortly after the restart.

In control: Bordeaux celebrate one of their four goals at the Chaban Delmas Stadium 

Perfect start: Bordeaux have now won two from two under coach Willy Sagnol 

First blood: Dimitar Berbatov had given Monaco the lead when he scored a diving header before half-time

Misery: Despite Berbatov's opening goal, Monaco slipped to a heavy defeat on the second matchday

Ineffective: Monaco's Colombian star Radamel Falcao was unable to influence the outcome

Emiliano Sala fired Bordeaux ahead from the penalty spot in the 61st minute and, only four minutes later Rolan grabbed his second. Monaco's humiliation was complete when Wahbi Khazri scored a 75th-minute penalty.

St Etienne are tied with Sagnol's men for first place after extending their own winning start to the season with a come-from-behind 3-1 win over Reims at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard.

It was not all plain sailing for Christophe Galtier's side, with Benjamin Moukandjo's effort finding its way into the home net via a deflection off Loic Perrin in the 27th minute.

But Les Verts turned the match on its head after the interval, with goals from Max Gradel, Kevin Monnet-Paquet and Mevlut Erdinc sealing victory to follow up their 2-0 victory over Guingamp on the opening day.

Montpellier bounced back from their opening-day defeat to record an impressive 2-0 victory at Marseille.

Rolland Courbis' side were beaten 2-1 by Bordeaux on the opening weekend but hit back in the best way possible, with Anthony Mounier and Morgan Sanson getting the goals.

Marseille had no answer, meaning their start to the season now reads one point from a possible six after their 3-3 draw with Bastia.
