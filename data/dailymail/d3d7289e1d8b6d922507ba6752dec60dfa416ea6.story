Diego Maradona insists he did a better job of getting the best out of Lionel Messi than current Argentina boss Alejandro Sabella.

Sabella guided his side to their first World Cup final in 24 years earlier this month but the legendary striker believes Messi looked out of sorts.

Maradona, who managed the national side from 2008 to 2010, bragged: ‘With me, Messi played five times better than with Sabella.

‘Don't tell me that now he sacrifices himself for the team.’

Despite their good run in Brazil, 59-year-old Cabella’s future is now uncertain.

And Maradona has suggested Cesar Luis Menotti as a replacement.

Maradona said: ‘I don't like Sabella (for the job).

'There’s someone forgotten: Menotti, who is not working because he fights against the mafia (the AFA).'
