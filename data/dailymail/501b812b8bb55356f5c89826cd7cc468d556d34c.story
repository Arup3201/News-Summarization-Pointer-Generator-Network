She is known for her glamorous red carpet look and love of charity runs, and Katherine Jenkins managed to combine the two for the Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon in London today.

Looking immaculately coiffed, Katherine posed up along with other celebrities before embarking on the 13.1 mile circuit.

The Welsh mezzo-soprano, 33, styled her platinum blonde hair in a side-parted ponytail and wore black eyelash extensions, a hint of eyeshadow and a slick of pink lip gloss for photo calls before and after the event.

The tanned star managed to look polished throughout the main event as she donned a pair of stylish sunglasses.

Katherine, an Ambassador for the 
Half Marathon today, completed the circuit in 2hrs 14mins and 23secs raising money for the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity.

'Viewing
myself as a non-athletic person, I prove the example that with some 
training and an good mental attitude you can achieve the things you 
thought you would never could, in my case, running a half marathon and 
even a full marathon,' says Katherine on the Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon website.

'We think she is a fantastic role model for young women across the
country and, with a fan base that spreads even further than that, we 
hope she will inspire other runners to sign up, and show that running 
and glamour are not mutually exclusive!' say organisers. 

With her immaculate hair and make-up, it's hard to believe the blonde signer had just ran 13.1 miles

In April this year, Katherine ran the London Marathon's 26.2 miles in five hours twenty-six minutes.

The singer was running in memory of her father Selwyn, who died when she was 15 after losing a battle with lung cancer. She revealed she had raised more than £22,000 for Macmillan.

The double Classical Brit Award winner 
sang the National Anthem at this year’s Grand National.

Katherine was spotted arriving at London's Heathrow Airport wearing a pair of very kinky boots on Friday.

Other celebrities taking part in the run today included presenters Sian Williams and Jenni Falconer, newsreader Sophie Raworth, hairdresser Andrew Barton and dancer Natalie Lowe.

The Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon prides itself on a stunning 13.1 mile autumnal route through four of London’s magnificent Royal Parks and past many of the capital’s world-famous landmarks.

The event started in 2008 as an annual fundraising initiative to raise funds to support London’s eight Royal Parks, and also create an opportunity for charities of all sizes to benefit from a major challenge event.

Over the last five years, the Half Marathon has raised more than £15m for causes around the UK.
