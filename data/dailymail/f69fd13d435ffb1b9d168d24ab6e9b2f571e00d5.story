A controversial Muslim school where 
staff were forced to wear the hijab has temporarily closed after 
concerns were raised by Ofsted inspectors.

They
were called to the Al-Madinah free school in Derby to investigate a 
series of concerns, including claims that girls were made to sit at the 
back of classes.

It is 
understood their initial findings were so damning that headteacher 
Stuart Wilson had little choice but to make the ‘unprecedented’ move of 
shutting the school immediately.

The Al-Madinah school, in Derby, has today closed temporarily over 'health and safety' issues after the first day of its Ofsted inspection

The Daily Mail has today published the account of 'Jane' who quit her job at the school after she was told her business suit was indecent

Many parents learnt of the move in a one-line letter handed out when they picked their children up after school on Tuesday.

Some
arrived at the school yesterday seeking answers. They were simply told 
there was a ‘health and safety issue’ and it was ‘hoped the school would
re-open by Monday’.

Ofsted said it could not disclose its full concerns until the inspection is complete, which could take several days.

A spokesman said it had ‘made some findings and shared them with the principal’.

But
a source told the Mail that among the concerns yesterday was that a 
number of staff have not had DBS checks – previously known as CRB checks
– the official process of ensuring unsuitable people do not work with 
young or vulnerable individuals.

Two police officers visited the school yesterday for undisclosed reasons, but were believed to have been visiting the teachers.

It
has not yet been confirmed whether other concerns, including the strict
dress codes imposed on non-Muslim teachers and the segregation of girls
and boys, were linked to the closure.

The
Daily Mail yesterday published the account of a teacher, referred to as
‘Jane’. She was asked by the government-sponsored free school to dress 
modestly, covering her hair and ensuring she did not show any flesh 
apart from her face, hands and feet.

She
said she abided by the request, but was told her grey suit with a skirt
below the knees,  thick knitted black stockings, calf-length boots and 
covered head was ‘abhorrent’ by a male teacher at the school. He 
allegedly told her she had failed to observe ‘common decency’.

Nick
Raine, a regional officer for the National Union of Teachers, who had 
been contacted by six teachers from the school with concerns about its 
practices, said shutting a school within hours of an inspection is 
‘unprecedented’.

He added: 
‘It must be quite significant for a school to be shut down so quickly.’ 
The school is already being investigated by the Education Funding 
Agency, from which it receives public money, over alleged irregularities
over its grants.

The free school, which opened in September 2012, has also drawn criticism for allegedly sitting girls at the back of classrooms

Yesterday 
Mohammed Ali, whose six-year-old daughter attends the school, said: ‘As 
parents we are really concerned...we need to know if we should start 
looking at other schools.’

A
message to parents on the school’s website from the head-teacher simply
read: ‘Owing to a health and safety issue, I have taken the decision to
close the school to primary and secondary pupils until I am confident 
that all children are safe on site.’

One
mother, who has two daughters in the secondary school, said she did not
believe it should be shut. The 34-year-old, who did not want to be 
named, said: ‘I am not extreme, but I think it is brilliant girls are 
separated. It is what our religion teaches.’

Ofsted was today completing a two-day visit to the school which has been accused of ordering women to wear the hijab scarf regardless of their religion

A spokesman for the school, who did not want to be named, said the school was closed today. When asked when it would reopen, he said: 'We don't know'
