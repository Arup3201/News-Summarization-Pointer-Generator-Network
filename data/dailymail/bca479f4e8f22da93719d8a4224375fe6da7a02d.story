A hot tub that became too hot to handle may have sparked a blaze which almost gutted a family home, it emerged today.

The fire ripped through the semi-detached home in Openshaw, Greater Manchester, and quickly reduced its conservatory and kitchen to a smoking ruin.

Sharon and Gary Davies, who live in the house, have been told by fire crews that the blaze may have originated from their outdoor heated pool.

The couple were out at work but Mrs Davies's daughter Danielle Bright, 23, had to flee the house with her three brothers, aged 19, 17 and 11, and 15-month-old nephew after a neighbour alerted her to the 7am blaze.

Miss Davies said: 'I went downstairs and the garden and all the kitchen doors were on fire. I managed to wake the kids and get them all outside and then I rang the fire brigade.

'It was about 20 minutes before the fire brigade came, but they had it out in five or ten minutes.'

The fire ravaged the family’s back garden, destroyed the conservatory and kitchen and smoke damage has spread to every room in the house.

The incident happened during a two-hour strike by firefighters as part of a continuing pensions dispute

Mother-of-five Mrs Davies, 45, had left early for her cleaning job at Manchester College before the blaze broke out.

But when her daughter rang to tell her the news, she raced back and was stunned to see the damage.

She said: 'Everything is destroyed. You work so hard and then this happens. At least everyone got out and the kids are all right.'

The cause of the fire is still under investigation but fire bosses say the hot tub could be the source

Mrs Davies and her pipe fitter husband, also 45, are planning to remain at the property while the clear-up takes place.

The incident happened during a two-hour strike by firefighters as part of a continuing pensions dispute.

Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service insist they had adequate cover and had responded in good time.

Paul Argyle, assistant county fire officer, said: 'There was no risk to life in this incident and the emergency fire crew, who provide cover during industrial action, were mobilised and arrived within our required attendance times.'
