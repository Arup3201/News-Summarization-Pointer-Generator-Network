Tim Cook has called for equality for all, regardless of race or sexual preference, and urged Congress to pass laws to reflect this, in a deeply, and uncharacteristically, personal address.

The Alabama-born Apple CEO, 53, was accepting a lifetime achievement award from Auburn University at the United Nations in New York last week when he described how an image of a cross burning during the civil rights struggles in the 1960s was 'imprinted in my brain' and put equality 'at the core of my beliefs and values.'

He talked of experiencing discrimination first hand in his life, but said he was fortunate to join Apple, a place he claims goes out of its way to treat employers equally and make its products accessible to minorities and those with disabilities, not for economic gain but 'because it is right and just.'

Impassioned speech: Tim Cook called for equality for all in the deeply personal address after he received a lifetime achievement award from Auburn University at the United Nations in New York last week

Impassioned, Cook began the speech by describing how he witnessed the 'devastating impacts of discrimination,' growing up in 1960s Alabama.

'Remarkable people were denied opportunities and treated without basic human dignity solely because of the color of their skin,' he said, before recounting the moment he saw a cross burning on the front lawn of a nearby black family.

'This image was permanently imprinted in my brain and it would change my life forever,' he said.

'For me, the cross burning was a symbol of ignorance, of hatred and a fear of anyone different than the majority.

'I could never understand it, but I knew then that America's, and Alabama's, history would always be scarred by the hatred that it represented.'

Cook went on in the address to push 
Congress to act on immigration reform and to pass the Employment 
Non-Discrimination Act of 2013, which would 'demand equality and 
non-discrimination for all employees, regardless of who they love.'

'This legislation prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. I have long believed in this and Apple has implemented protection for employees even when the laws did not,' he said, then demanded it was time this was 'written into the book of law.'Â 

Under his leadership, Apple has been a strong advocate for gay equality and the company donated money to fight California's Proposition, which would have banned same-sex marriage. He was named as Out Magazine's most powerful LGBT person in the world this year.

Cook explained that pictures of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. hung on the walls of his office and served to inspire him.

He quoted both men as well as Nelson Mandela on the matter of taking bold action to end prejudice.

'Today we have an opportunity, we have an opportunity to continue our progress with respect to race, and also to embrace immigration reform and eliminate discrimination of the GLBT community,' he said to applause.

Cook then challenged the room to 'push with all your might' for reform that recognized basic human rights and human dignity.

'Both of these are great for the American economy, but do not do them because they are economically sound, although they are,' he urged. 'Do them because they are right and just.'

'Never allow the majority to limit the rights of the minority.'
