When Helen
 the giant tortoise fell ill, her keepers were faced with two big 
problems: How to get all 14 stone of her to the vet – and how to 
persuade her to take her medicine.

With
 a little ingenuity, the combined muscle power of four men and a few 
sticks of celery, they solved both and Helen is now well on the mend.

The
 drama began to unfold – at a relaxed pace – when staff at Bristol Zoo 
noticed that the 32-year-old tortoise was making a whistling sound when 
breathing.

Things are looking up: Helen, the 32-year-old tortoise, is checked over by vets at Bristol Zoo after she began suffering breathing problems

Medicine: The animal - which is classified as 'vulnerable' - was given antibiotics to help battle the illness

With a 
battery of tests needed, Helen, a ‘gentle and easy-going’ tortoise, had 
to be taken to the onsite clinic for the first time.

Staff
 vet Richard Saunders said: ‘It was a question of having four people – 
somebody on each corner – and lifting her gently by the shell.

Giant: Helen has been at the zoo for 11 years and weighs 14 stone

Getting better: Helen is pictured being wheeled to a check-up after developing a nasal infection

Aldabra giant tortoises come from the bleak Aldabra atoll in the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean

They are said to live for up to 250 years but no one knows for sure because they have outlived the scientists studying them and proper records have not been kept

Males grow up to 4ft and weigh 40 stone, females 3ft and 25 stone.The creatures were plundered by sailors and settlers for their meat

Charles Darwin helped set up a breeding programme but their numbers are still low

'She was 
put on a trolley and wheeled through the zoo. It would have taken a long
 time if we had waited for her to walk.’ 

Once at the clinic, vets were concerned that Helen would simply withdraw into her shell, so she was given a full anaesthetic.

Helen,
 one of six Aldabra giant tortoises at the zoo, also had blood tests, 
nose swabs and X-rays.

A nasal infection, caused by a mixture of 
bacteria, was diagnosed.

Different from a cold, this can be treated with antibiotics and Helen, who has been at the zoo for 11 years, was discharged.

Giant
 tortoises can be stubborn but Helen happily takes her medicine.

Mr 
Saunders said: ‘We are able to put the tablets in a line inside a piece 
of celery, which she comes running for.’

Now, a fortnight after the trip to the vet, Helen’s breathing is much better and she is expected to make a full recovery.
