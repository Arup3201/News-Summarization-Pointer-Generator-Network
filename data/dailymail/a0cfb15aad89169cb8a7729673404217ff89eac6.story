A man who was a fugitive for almost two weeks after fleeing his trial a day before being convicted in the repeated group sexual assault of an 11-year-old Texas girl, smiled as he was led into court today to be sentenced to 99 years without parole.

Dressed in a red jumpsuit, handcuffed and with a chain around his waist and legs, Eric McGowen was formally sentenced in the same courtroom from which he had fled on August 29.

Guilty: Eric McGowen, was convicted and sentenced in 2012 to 99 years in prison for the shocking crime

McGowen, who had dyed his hair a reddish brown while on the run, will now be transferred to the Texas prison system.

The 20-year-old did not say anything during the brief court hearing, and mostly looked at the floor. When asked by state District Judge Mark Morefield if there was any legal reason why the sentence shouldn't be imposed, McGowen appeared to mumble something to his attorney, Matthew Poston. Poston said his client objected to the sentence because it was 'cruel and unusual.

McGowen was one of 20 men and boys who authorities say repeatedly sexually assaulted the girl on at least five occasions from mid-September through early December of 2010. He was the first defendant to stand trial in the case.

He did not say anything to reporters as he held up a piece of paper over his face while being led out of the courthouse by officers and loaded into a police car in the pouring rain. On August 29, McGowen was on trial, but never came back to court after a break in testimony. McGowen had been free on bail at the time. He fled the same day the girl tearfully testified about the attacks in her hometown of Cleveland, about 45 miles northeast of Houston.The trial, held in the nearby county seat of Liberty, went on without him and a jury the next day convicted him of aggravated sexual assault of a child and then sentenced him in absentia.

Authorities tracked McGowen down to an apartment in northeast Houston and arrested him on Tuesday. Six law enforcement agencies had coordinated the search for him. McGowen was apparently caught by surprise, as he was sitting on a toilet when authorities entered the apartment and arrested him, officials said.The investigation regarding individuals who might have helped McGowen elude authorities continues, officials said.Before his trial, all six juveniles and two of the 14 adults charged had pleaded guilty. Since McGowen's conviction, four other adults have pleaded guilty and are set to be sentenced on September 21.His disappearance was the latest twist in a case that has divided the small town of Cleveland, both because of the horrific allegations and suggestions from some residents that the girl was partly responsible because of her appearance. Police began investigating after one of the girl's classmates told a teacher he saw video of her being sexually assaulted in an abandoned trailer.Prosecutors' case against McGowen included a videotaped confession and testimony from nearly a dozen witnesses, including the girl, who is now 13. Poston did not present any witnesses or evidence.

Crime scene: Authorities say this is the abandoned trailer where an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in November 2010 in the town of Cleveland, Texas

The
 girl, who authorities haven't named, testified against McGowen, describing the series of horrendous attacks that took 
place in the small Texas community of Cleveland, 45 miles from Houston.

In court, the middle school student, dressed in a plaid shirt and blue jeans and wearing a gold cross around her neck, described how McGowen took her to a house in October 2010 where she had sex with multiple males. 

The girl said she was brought into 
what she described as the 'baby room' in the house, and that McGowen and
 others took turns having sex with her.

Testifying under the pseudonym Regina, the girl smiled nervously and answered questions quietly.

But she began to cry when prosecutors began playing a graphic video tape of her having anal sex during one of the alleged attacks.

She said the video, which several jurors turned away from, was of her being assaulted by another man charged in the case.

She identified McGowen in the film laughing in the background, telling the attacker to 'beat that ho.'

'Did the guys just take turns with you?' prosecutor Joe Warren asked.

'Yes sir,' the girl said.

The girl seemed calm for most of the roughly one and a half hours she testified.

She
 mostly gave short answers to questions, often pausing to stare at the 
floor or ceiling of the Liberty courtroom before responding.

She described another alleged rape in November 2010 that started in a different Cleveland home the defendants 
called the 'boom boom' room, according to prosecutors, and that 
continued later at a nearby abandoned trailer.

Asked by Warren if more than 20 males might have assaulted her that day, the girl responded, 'probably.'

Jurors
 were later shown police photos of used condoms and condom wrappers 
found inside and outside the house in the November incident.

Three people who have pleaded guilty — two adults and a juvenile who has since turned 18 — also testified yesterday.

Isaiah Ross, 22, told jurors he saw McGowen sexually assault the girl with a beer bottle.

The other adult, Marcus Porchia, 28, and the teen testified they saw others assault the girl but not McGowen.

Poston
 questioned the girl for about six minutes, during which time he asked 
whether she twice told police early in the investigation that she never 
had sex with McGowen.

The girl said she didn’t remember saying that.

During
 opening statements, Warren told jurors he would present 
them with videotaped and written confessions in which McGowen admitted 
to raping the girl.

'What took place to this girl was nothing better than a pack of animals attacking,' Warren said.

The prosecutor added that while the 
girl may be seen smiling and even laughing at some times on the videos, 
these individuals had 'duped, tricked and talked her into doing things 
against her best interests,' according to the Houston Chronicle.

Authorities say the then 11-year-old was 
assaulted at least five times between mid-September and early December 
2010 by a group of 20 males ranging in age from a middle school student 
to a 28-year-old.

During the trial,
 a videotaped police interview in which McGowen admitted he and eight 
other men took turns having sex with the girl, sometimes two at a time, 
was shown in court, although jurors were not present.

In the video, which McGowen's lawyers
 argued should not be allowed as evidence, the 20-year-old initially 
denied ever touching the girl, but he later broke down and told 
investigators he engaged in oral sex with her, according to the Houston 
Chronicle.

Poston tried but failed to get the confessions thrown out, arguing that police improperly questioned McGowen.

The investigation into the shocking gang-rapes began in 2010 after one of the girl's friends told a teacher he had seen a cellphone video that showed the 11-year-old being raped in an abandoned trailer.

Those charged included two top athletes at the local high school and adults with criminal records.

The case brought unflattering attention to Cleveland, a town of 9,000 people, after some residents suggested the girl was in part responsible for what happened, saying she wore makeup, looked older and wasn't properly supervised by her parents.

Other community residents, as well as groups from outside of town, sharply criticised those suggestions.

It has been complicated by a belief among many in the predominantly black neighborhood where several of the suspects live that the arrests were racially motivated. All of the suspects are black, while the girl is Hispanic.

Two other adults have previously pleaded guilty, with one receiving a 15-year prison term and the other awaiting sentencing.

Six juveniles who were charged also have previously pleaded guilty. They received 7-year prison terms, but their sentences were suspended and they were put on probation for that amount of time.

Most of the adult defendants in the case face charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child, while four face a charge of continuous sexual abuse of a child.
