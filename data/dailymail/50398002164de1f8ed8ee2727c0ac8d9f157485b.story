Ruud van Nistelrooy has compared Louis van Gaal's methods to those of Sir Alex Ferguson and tipped the Holland manager to restore glory to Manchester United.

The former striker worked under van Gaal during the new United manager's first spell as Dutch boss and called him a 'Ferguson-type character.'

Van Nistelrooy, who scored 150 goals in 219 matches for United between 2001 and 2006, is working as a pundit for ESPN during the world Cup.

And speaking on air during Saturday's coverage, the 38-year-old said: 'Everyone will know who is the boss. He does everything himself.

'Louis has assistants, but he does all the coaching - every session. He's very hands-on.

'He is a Ferguson-type character and it's what they need now. Louis is a good manager.'

Van Gaal is set to take up the reins at Old Trafford after the end of the World Cup and has already signalled his intentions by signing Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw for a combined Â£58.8m.

Van Nistelrooy added that Van Gaal won't be taking any holiday and is keen to get stuck in to day-to-day life at United straight away.

Unveiling: Luke Shaw has also joined United from Southampton and will be first choice left-back next season

He said: 'He will start work immediately at Manchester United after the World Cup.

'Louis won't have a holiday. He has to start immediately. There is pre-season training and he has to get to know the players.

'Then there is the tour to America and into the Premier League season. He will look at the players at United and if he sees someone he likes he will give them a chance.

'He likes to do that. He is prepared to promote. He won't just go out and just buy players.'

Van Gaal's arrival in Manchester could come sooner than expected if Holland lose to Mexico in their last-16 clash in Fortaleza on Sunday evening.

But after winning all three of their group matches - scoring 10 goals in the process - Holland will be favourites to advance.

Van Nistelrooy added: 'He is doing a good job here with Holland. This is better than everyone expected and he is very relaxed.

Leader: Van Gaal has fostered a feeling of optimism in the Holland camp as they prepare to take on Mexico in the last-16

'Arjen Robben has kept himself fit for two years and is better than ever. He is so important, with his pace, when we counter-attack.'

Van Nistelrooy is set to be assistant to Gus Hiddink when he succeeds Van Gaal as Dutch boss.
