Gary Barlow's World Cup single Greatest Day has been removed from iTunes, reports today suggest

Gary Barlow's Greatest Day will not be England's official World Cup single, reports suggest.

The single, which features numerous celebrities including singer Kimberly Walsh and footballer Michael Owen, was made available to download on iTunes in March.

However the song, originally released as part of Sport Relief fundraising efforts, is no longer listed on the music buying site - with officials confirming there are 'no plans' to release it as a single.

It comes just weeks after Barlow was exposed for sheltering money in a tax avoidance scheme.

The singer was ordered by the High Court to pay back millions of pounds he sheltered in the £340million Icebreaker scheme earlier this month.

The FA said that, although the song was endorsed by them, it was a Comic Relief production.

A spokesman said: 'Although we have given our endorsement, it is very much their (Comic Relief) production and any release would be managed by them with all proceeds going to their Sport Relief charity.'

A Comic Relief spokesperson told The Independent: 'There are currently no plans to release the version of Greatest Day shown on the Sport Relief 2014 night of TV as a single.

'The video will be available to view on YouTube during the World Cup.'

It was understood the single was supposed to be released formally in June in the run up to the tournament.related]

The move may well mark the end of an official England song being released. In 2010, Fabio Capello banned a 2010 tournament single as he wanted everyone to be 'fully focused on the football'.

Earlier this month, a tax judge ruled Icebreaker was not a genuine investment scheme. Consequently, Barlow, 43, his bandmates Howard Donald, 46, Mark Owen, 42, and their manager Jonathan Wild could be forced to pay £20million back HMRC.

It is thought they put £66million into several Icebreaker partnerships, reportedly allowing them to shelter around £63million from the taxman.

Other well-known names who have invested in Icebreaker include retired Olympic hurdler Colin Jackson, 47, former England football manager Terry Venables, 71, and businessman Nick Wheeler, who is the founder of Charles Tyrwhitt shirts.

It is thought some of the investors have told HMRC they were misled into joining Icebreaker, and did not realise it was a tax avoidance scheme.

The dropped single had not been particularly popular with fans - with David Baddiel, who sang the 1996 England anthem Three Lions calling the single 'a bit rubbish'.

A number of other singles are now being lined up to take the title of England's official World Cup anthem.

Come on England (Don’t Break My Heart) by Mansfield fans Mark Estell and Stephen Goalby is already on iTunes and is a hot favourite.

Kaiser Chiefs want their tune Coming Home to be the soundtrack, reports suggest.
