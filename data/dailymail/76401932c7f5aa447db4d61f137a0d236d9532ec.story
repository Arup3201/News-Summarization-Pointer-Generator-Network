Hundreds of America's best Hot Rods rolled in to Las Vegas yesterday for a four-day festival dedicated that showcases the classic cars of the early 20th Century.

Up to 20,000 fans will descend on Sin City to view the suped up cars that will be put on show during the Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly Weekender.

Cars drove in to the Nevada city from as far afield as Colorado and the East Coast of America.

The suped up cars look like props from the classic musical Grease

The four-day festival is being held at the Orleans Hotel and features some of the most iconic vehicles in the U.S

Almost 1,000 classic cars from the 1950s and earlier are taking part in the retro festival, which is in its sixteenth year.

Among the glamorous cars were a Hemi Sierra and Ford convertibles that looked as if they had driven straight from the set of Grease.

However, some were not as chic.

An ice-cream van with flames up the side provided a bit of light relief from the rows of cars competitively lined up in the parking lot outside the Orleans.

Vintage vehicles from the 1910s, 1920s and 1930s, with modified engines, were also parked up for the festival.

Hot Rods describe American cars with larger engines that have been modified for speed.

Thousands of people will visit the Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly Weekender where the classic cars are on show

The festival also features a vintage fashion show, live music and a burlesque bingo

The term was commonly used from the 1930s and 1940s but its origin is not known.

It may have derived from 'hot roadster' or modifications to the camshaft, known as a 'rod'.

The U.S has one of the strongest Hot Rod communities in the world, where fans build their cars using original parts gathered from wrecking yards or from new parts.

The pastime is also popular in the UK, Australia, Sweden and Canada.

More than 60 live bands are also booked into play at the festival, which celebrates all things Rockabilly.

Rockabilly is one of the earliest styles of rock and roll music that dates back to the early 1950s.

The festival, which runs until Sunday, also features  vintage fashion show, bowling and burlesque bingo

The festival is celebrating its 16trh anniversary this year
