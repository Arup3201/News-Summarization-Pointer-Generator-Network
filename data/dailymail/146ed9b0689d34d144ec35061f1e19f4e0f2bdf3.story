Adelaide Strikers batsman Jono Dean was hitting the ball so hard during his side's victory over the Hobart Hurricanes that he split his bat in two.

As the No 3 went to larrup a delivery from Timm van der Gugten through the covers, his willow broke in half, necessitating a change of blade.

It did not alter Dean's approach, however, as he sealed a comfortable win for the Strikers with a huge six.

The 30-year-old right-hander was playing only his fifth Big Bash match and his 54 not out from 34 balls, containing six sixes, was his top score.

Dean and Tim Ludeman (54) - who upstaged Kevin Pietersen in the opening game of this year's Big Bash - comfortably took Adelaide past Hobart's 136 for eight with a whopping 33 balls to spare.

The Hurricanes never really got going, bar Jonathan Wells who scored 58, and it was no surprise that they were blown away with the Strikers making more than half their total in sixes.

The match produced another anomaly when Hobart's Darren Sammy bowled a delivery from behind the umpire.

The batsman seemed so surprised that it ended up being a dot ball.
