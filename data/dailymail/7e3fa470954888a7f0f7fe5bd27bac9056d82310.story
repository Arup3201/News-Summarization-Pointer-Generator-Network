The parents of James Foley are speaking out about how they feel the Obama administration handled their son's situation in the aftermath of his very public and very violent beheading at the hands of ISIS. 

Diane and John Foley have said in an interview that they don't believe the White House was very good about communicating with them, and were not as concerned as they should have been about their son. 

'We didn't feel Jim was a priority, even though we were told that from the very beginning that he was and just to trust that everything was being done,' said Mrs. Foley.

This comes as reports in the aftermath of Foley's death have claimed that ISIS agreed to return him for $750,000 and that the government knew the exact location, down to the building, of Foley and several other captives of the terrorist organization. 

'No one seemed to be accountable for these four Americans who were captive together. No one could give us answers,' Mrs. Foley told Fox News.

Foley was taken captive on Thanksgiving Day 2012 and beheaded in August 2014 in response to American airstrikes in Iraq.

Video of his brutal beheading at the hands of Jihadi John was then released by ISIS.

Now, they Foleys are trying to enact some change in the wake of their own personal tragedy in how the United States handles hostage situations.

'Jim counted on our government to get them home,'  said Mrs. Foley. 

'Jim was very hopeful and confident that our government would find a way. We don't want Jim to have died in vain.'

These statements are being echoed by the parents of a former Marine who was kidnapped in Syria over two years ago want more information from the Obama administration.

Marc and Debra Tice said that they have been given little to no information about their son, photojournalist Austin Tice, since he disappeared near Damascus in August 2012, and that they believe all information should be made available to them.

'We feel certain that there's more information that could be shared with us. It's not shared with us because we don't have the appropriate clearances, and we're not vetted,' said Mrs. Tice. 

The Tices recent media push and the statements given by the Foleys, a far cry from the low profile approach adopted by most parents of individuals who have been kidnapped overseas, come as President Obama has pledged to do everything he can to help these families in the wake of the death of 26-year-old kidnapping victim Kayla Mueller who was taken by ISIS in August 2013.

She was reportedly killed by a Jordanian airstrike against the terrorist organization.

'It's as tough as anything that I do -- having conversations with parents who understandably want, by any means necessary, for their children to be safe,' said Obama in a speech this week.

'We will do everything we can short of providing an incentive for future Americans to be caught.'
