A high school football recruit has pulled out of attending the University of Oklahoma after a video emerged of a campus fraternity engaged in racist chanting.

Jean Delance, a junior at North Mesquite High School in Texas, says he has de-committed from the university and has spoke out in criticism of the footage. 

The video shows several young men on a bus participating in a chant that included the n-word and referencing lynching.

The footage of the university's chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, also shows at least one woman at the back of the bus clapping her hands along with the vile song, 'There will never be a n***** in SAE.'

In a television interview on KTVT in Dallas, Delance described the video as 'very disturbing' and the people in it as 'uneducated'.

He said: 'It is very distrubing, I never thought that stuff was still as trendy as back then or that it keeps repeating itself.'

He also spoke of his disappointment that Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops did not call him to alert him of the situation.

He added: 'I was just notified by the coaches this morning. I was hoping they would let me know ahead of time.

'If they did that I would have been very calm with it but I just had to find out about it on my own.'

The university has now expelled the fraternity over the video with the school's president, David Boren saying he was sickened and couldn't eat or sleep after learning about the video.

Meanwhile the football team decided to protest rather than practice yesterday at the team's indoor training facility.

National leaders of Sigma Alpha Epsilon have said that its investigation confirmed members took part in the chant and announced it would close the local chapter.

The national group said it was ‘embarrassed’ by the ‘unacceptable and racist’ behavior.

Mr Boren said members have until midnight Tuesday to remove their belongings from the fraternity house.

He said the fraternity was ‘not totally forthcoming’ and he was still trying to find out who was on the bus so the school could consider disciplinary actions.

He also added that the university's legal staff was exploring whether the students who initiated and encouraged the chant may have violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination.

It's unclear who recorded the video, when it was made and who initially leaked it online. 

Mr Boren suggested it was likely taken by another student who didn't agree with what was being said about African- Americans.
