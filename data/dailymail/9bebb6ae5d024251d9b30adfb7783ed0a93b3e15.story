It began with an affair with the boss’ wife - and ended with him becoming a mafia hit man.

One of the Colombo family’s most prolific assassins has spoken about the 25 murder plots he took part in, four of them where he pulled the trigger.

Larry Mazza revealed how he blasted rivals at point blank range with a shotgun before calmly going home to babysit a friend’s daughter and watch episodes of Seinfeld.

Mafia marriage: Big Linda Schiro, right, was wife of mobster Gregory 'The Grim Reaper' Scarpa, a Colombo who once said he had stopped counting the number of his murder victims at 50

He also told how he began an affair with the wife of a notorious mafioso - who incredibly let them carry on even though he knew about it.

Mazza’s introduction to the mob began in 1979 when he began a relationship with Linda Schiro, who was married to Gregory ‘The Grim Reaper’ Scarpa.

Scarpa famously bragged that after killing 50 people he ‘stopped counting’ during his bloody time as a capo in the Colombo family.

Mazza was the straight-laced 18-year-old son of a fire lieutenant and working as a delivery boy in Brooklyn, New York.

The boss’s wife was 32, wealthy, powerful and an adviser to her husband on his criminal activities.

She invited him over with the words: ‘Do you fool around?’ 

Mazza told the New York Post: ‘She had beautiful eyes, very Italian looking. She put a bottle of wine out and some M&M’s. We had a few glasses. The next thing you know we were on the couch getting hot and heavy.’

His new lover introduced him to her husband and got him a job collecting debts from a racing track. Soon he became an enforcer forcing people to pay up.

Mazza told the newspaper: ‘One got a truck driven through their storefront. Another got visits from us and we’d walk out without paying.’

Head: Victor 'Little Vic' Orena, reputed to be the acting boss of the Colombo crime family, in federal custody in 1992

Murder followed soon after, he added. ‘The first one, it’s drop me off. Next one, I’d pick him up. Next time, bring a shovel. Baby steps.’

One of Scarpa’s drivers was badly beaten and then killed for trying to kiss his 14-year-old daughter as he took her to school.

Then in 1991 a civil war erupted in the Colombo family between underboss Victor Orena and patriarch Carmine Persico, who had been jailed.

Persico loyalist Mazza said that ‘for eight months, that’s all we did: wake up and go looking for people to kill’

One of his most bloody executions was in Christmas 1991, that of Orena loyalist Vinnie Fusaro.

Mazza said: ‘We were passing by the social clubs where Vic’s guys would hang out. 

‘This day we spotted Vinnie’s car, so we came around the block again. He was in his driveway, hanging Christmas lights on the garage. He never seen us. He was facing the garage.

‘Greg (Scarpa) had an Army type of rifle, an M52. He says, ‘Don’t even get out.’ He rolls down the window and hit him right behind the ear. It was a hell of a shot. Guy went down like a sack of potatoes.

‘But he shot him two more times - once in the neck and one in the body.’

Another gruesome killing was that of Orena lieutenant Nicholas ‘Nicky Black’ Grancio who was killed despite a ceasefire being in effect.

Mazza said: ‘He (Grancio) gets to a house and pulls over. His nephew, Joe Colino, was in the passenger seat. We pull up. 

‘We’re in a sedan, and we had a big walkie-talkie and coffee cups in the window and a blue police siren. I can’t believe he didn’t notice us. I just think he was so convinced it was the law.

‘Greg had his rifle, but he was having trouble with the security clip. I had the shotgun, a 12-gauge, double-barrelled riot-control gun stolen from a police car in Lakewood, New Jersey.

‘Greg said, ‘Let’s get him.’ So I opened my window, pulled out the shotgun. I was close enough I could have smacked him. I aimed right behind his ear. I saw his whole face fly off, including his nose, and hit the windshield. It was chilling.

‘His nephew got hit with fragments. He was just screaming. I heard it a block away. 

‘We dropped Greg off at the house and drove back to (friend) Jimmy’s house, where we had to babysit his daughter. 

‘We had just done something like that, and here we were, playing with his baby, drinking wine and watching Seinfeld.'

Mazza’s career nearly came to an end when he had another unpleasant encounter - with his boss.

Saving time: Because he informed on allegedly corrupt ex-FBI agent Lindley DeVecchio (right), Mazzo got a lighter sentence than nine years

Scarpa had told him that whenever he was thinking about killing somebody, he sat him in a particular chair and if he got the wrong answer, somebody would come out of the closet and finish him.

Mazza found himself in that same chair one day with his boss telling him: ‘You haven’t been the same. I love you like a son and Linda loves you, and I know you two are close.’

Mazza thought: ‘I can see where this is going, and I’m getting nervous. The closet is right behind me. He said, ‘I know what’s going on with you and Linda.’ ”

'I opened my window, pulled out the 
shotgun. I was close enough I could have smacked him. I aimed right 
behind his ear. I saw his whole face fly off, including his nose, and 
hit the windshield. It was chilling.'

‘I said, ‘Greg, I respect you and I think you are far from an idiot. But only an idiot wouldn’t see what’s going on.’

‘He busted out laughing. Came around and gave me a big hug and walks me outside. And so now I’m feeling better. He says, ‘I can understand how it happened. But nobody else in the world can know. Because if it gets out, the two of us could be killed.’ ‘

Mazza’s life as a mobster came to an end when he was shot in the eye and then arrested in Florida where he had escaped to lay low.

He was jailed for nine years for a string of charges including racketeering and murder, but because he informed on allegedly corrupt ex-FBI agent Lindley DeVecchio he got a lighter sentence.

Scarpa died in 1994 of AIDS which he contracted during a blood transfusion. He insisted he just get blood from his own staff, but it turned out one of them was infected.

Nowadays Mazza lives in Florida and makes a living as a personal trainer.

He dropped out of the witness protection programme and does not fear the mob will come after him.

He said: ‘People thought if I followed my father, I could have been a captain (in the fire service) or even a chief.

‘How could this have happened?’
