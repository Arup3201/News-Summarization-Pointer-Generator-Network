Coalition relations are under growing strain after George Osborne led a Tory ambush on the Liberal Democrats – insisting the Government should enshrine in law a pledge for an EU referendum.

At a Cabinet meeting to determine the Government’s programme for the year ahead, the Chancellor and Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith demanded an EU Referendum Bill, which has repeatedly been rejected by Lib Dems.

The plan was immediately turned down by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and education minister David Laws, whose party opposes Tory plans for an in/out referendum on EU membership by 2017.

Tory Chancellor George Osborne demanded an EU Referendum Bill be included in the Queen's Speech, but Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has rejected the idea of legislating for an in-out vote

David Cameron then sprung a further 
surprise on the Lib Dems by declaring that legislation to allow 
constituents to trigger a ‘recall’ vote on errant MPs – which Mr Clegg 
has attempted to blame the Prime Minister for killing off – should go 
ahead.

In another sign of 
coalition bad blood, Mr Cameron was also accused of ‘stealing’ an 
announcement from Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable on the 
Government’s acceptance of a recommendation that the minimum wage should
 rise to £6.50 an hour.

The 
Chancellor’s aides were said to have been in talks with Lib Dem 
officials yesterday morning about the timing of Mr Cable making the 
announcement, only for the Prime Minister to steal his thunder in a 
speech on the economy hours later.

Prime Minister David Cameron also surprised the Lib Dems by saying would now support giving voters the power to oust MPs

Under pressure from the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party, David Cameron used a speech in January last year to set out his plan to renegotiate a 'fresh settlement' with Brussels, clawing back powers to London.

If he is Prime Minister after the next election he would then hold an in-out referendum.

The in/out referendum would take place before 2017, halfway through the 2015-20 Parliament.

The
 Tories also drew up a backbench Bill which would legislate for a 
referendum, but this has been killed off by opposition from Labour and 
the Lib Dems in the House of Lords.

Now the Tories want it included in the Queen's Speech this year, something the Lib Dems would block.

‘This
 is the Lib Dems getting a taste of their own medicine,’ said one senior
 Tory. ‘If they don’t want to let people have a say on Europe then we 
are going to rub their noses in it again and again.’

Earlier
 this year, Labour and the Lib Dems conspired to kill off a Tory MP’s 
backbench bill, supported by the party leadership, which would commit 
the Government to holding an EU referendum by 2017.

Mr Cameron has pledged to hold such a vote if he remains Prime Minister after the next election.

But
 the Tories say the commitment should be enshrined in legislation to 
assure sceptical voters and have attacked Labour and the Lib Dems as 
‘enemies of democracy’ for refusing to support it.

They insist the vast majority of voters want a say on EU membership.

Mr
 Osborne used yesterday’s Cabinet meeting to agree the contents of the 
forthcoming Queen’s Speech, to express dismay that the Lib Dems are 
withholding support for a referendum bill and insist he believed it 
should be included.

Sources said that he told the Cabinet meeting that it should be up to the public to decide on the issue.

One
 senior Lib Dem source said: ‘Raising this at this stage is a nakedly 
transparent attempt to generate some controversy to appease angry Tory 
backbenchers in the run-up to the Euro elections.’

Mr
 Cameron also said the Queen’s Speech would include a ‘right of recall’ 
measure, letting voters trigger a by-election if their MP was involved 
in serious wrongdoing.
