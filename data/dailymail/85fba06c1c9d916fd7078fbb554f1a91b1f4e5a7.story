A mother who claims doctors advised she abort her unborn son held her tiny newborn for the first time eight weeks after he defied the odds to survive a rare birth defect.

When Vicky Davies was 20 weeks pregnant a routine scan revealed her son had the condition congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).

Doctors at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl told the 33-year-old her baby had a 50 per cent chance of survival.

But despite his tiny stomach and intestines developing in his chest due to a hole in his diaphragm, Samuel Wilson was born on May 23 - five weeks before his due date.

Vicky Davies was finally able to hold her tiny son Samuel for the first time, eight weeks after he defied the odds to survive a rare birth defect

Ms Davies, left with her son, claims doctors advised her to terminate her pregnancy, after revealing he had a 50 per cent chance of surviving at her 20-week scan when he was diagnosed with a rare condition, congenital diaphragmatic hernia

The defect caused a hole in his diaphragm allowing part of his intestines to push into his chest cavity

Now 10 weeks old, Samuel is being cared for in hospital as his parents and three siblings prepare to welcome him home for the first time next week.

Mother-of-four, Ms Davies said: 'We went to find out if we were having a boy or a girl and our whole world came crashing down.

'We were told about his CDH and that there was a chance he would have Down’s Syndrome.

'Due to the low survival rate we were advised to look at the option of aborting the pregnancy.

'But I just couldn’t even imagine it. I know they have to give you all the options but I just had to give him a chance at survival.'

Ms Davies and her partner Gavin Wilson, 40, were rushed from their home in Rhyl to Liverpool Women’s Hospital where Samuel was born weighing 4lb 15oz.

He was placed in an incubator before his parents had the chance to hold their son.

Ms Davies, said: 'We were told that it might not make it through the weekend, and six days after he was born we got a call at 1am to say they could do no more for him.

Samuel was born on May 23 - five weeks before his due date. Before his parents, Ms Davies and Gavin Wilson were able to hold him, he was placed in an incubator in the special care unit at Liverpool Women's Hospital

'I ran to the ward. I thought I was going to have to leave the hospital without my baby.

'But Samuel has been fighting ever since. He has the operation to move his stomach and intestines down on June 10 and is even feeding through a bottle now.'

After waiting eight weeks, Ms Davies is now able to hold her new born son.

She said: 'I finally feel like a normal mum. It was so hard waiting but he was so poorly, I just knew I had to wait.

'My daughter Elisa, 10, has held him a few times, but my two boys Jack, seven, and Thomas, four, are still a bit nervous.

'They love him to bits though and come and see him whenever they can.'

Samuel was first moved to Alder Hey hospital and is now in Glan Clwyd. He is expected to finally be allowed home next Wednesday, August 20.

A spokesman for Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which runs Glan Clwyd Hospital,  said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases, as discussions between patients and their doctors are private.

'However, our clinicians would ensure that patients and families are aware of all available medical options in cases such as this.'

CDH occurs in around one in 2,500 births and accounts for approximately eight per cent of all major congenital abnormalities.

The diaphragm normally develops in an unborn baby by around the seven to 10 week gestation period.

CDH occurs when the diaphragm fails to form correctly or fails to develop in the unborn baby.

Now 10 weeks old, baby Samuel is ready to be taken home for the first time when he is discharged from hospital next week

It means the abdominal contents herniate into the chest cavity, which in turn prevents the lungs from developing properly.

The stage at which the abdominal contents herniate, and the size of the hole in the diaphragm, determine how much the baby's lungs and other internal organs, including the heart, are affected.

In some rare cases CDH is part of a chromosomal syndrome, including Down's Syndrome.

The prognosis for babies diagnosed with CDH is 50 per cent.

Once baby is fully stabilised and the Doctors are happy with baby’s blood gases, oxygen levels and general progress, baby will undergo surgery to repair the hernia, but there is no set timescale for when the operation is likely to take place.
