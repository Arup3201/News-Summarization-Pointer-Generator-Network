Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger was joined by up to 70 close family and friends yesterday as he celebrated the life of his late partner L'Wren Scott.

The family attended the famed Hollywood Forever Funeral Home, in Los Angeles, at about 12.30pm yesterday before moving on to a reception at Sunset Tower Hotel, where they were seen arriving in a black mini-van and a limousine.

Traditional folk song Will The Circle Be Unbroken was sung by longtime Rolling Stones backing vocalist Bernard Fowler and three generations of Jaggers gave speeches at the fashion designer's funeral.

However it was the memories that a devastated Mick Jagger shared with mourners of his late partner that was said to have provided the most poignant part of the service.

Fighting the tears: Lizzie and Georgia May Jagger leave the service in Hollywood, California

The couple, who had been dating for 12 years, first met in L.A. on a magazine shoot in 2001.

About
 70 people, including Nicole Kidman and her husband Keith Urban and 
rocker Bryan Adams, gathered for the small service at the famed 
Hollywood Forever Funeral Home at about 12.30pm, according to People.

The
 cemetery was put on lock-down so that Scott could be laid to rest 
privately, with a huge security contingent searching all cars, including
 the trunks.

Blessings and prayers were led by the Rev. Ed Bacon of the All Saints Church in Pasadena.

Jagger - who was on tour in Australia when he found out his long-time love had committed suicide in her Manhattan apartment - was said to be 'nervous' when he eulogized Scott, according to The New York Daily News.

Scott's older brother Randy Bambrough, who is said to have handled most of the funeral arrangements, including transporting Scott's body from New York to L.A., also spoke.

Poems were read by Jagger's daughter, Karis, as well as the actress Ellen Barkin, a good friend of Scott's.

Jagger's daughter Jade and his grandchildren, Mazie and Zak, read psalms.

Bambrough's daughter, Hannah, read a Shakespearean sonnet.

A medical examiner ruled her death was by hanging.

At 8.30am on the morning of her death, Scott is believed to have texted her assistant, Brittany Penebre, to 'come by' her Chelsea apartment at 10am.

Penebre then made the baffling discovering.

Scott was reportedly days away from filing for bankruptcy on her self-titled fashion label.

She
 is expected to be buried at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery and the 
grounds are being kept under close watch today by a security crew ahead 
of her funeral.

where he has been seen on the balcony.

White floor-length curtains were hung
 around the overhang by the driveway of the storied cemetery so that 
cars would pull into the draped area and the passengers will be able to 
exit the car without being photographed.

A
 handful of close confidantes of the 49-year-old designer and her 
70-year-old rock star boyfriend were spotted arriving in Los Angeles 
over the past few days.

Jagger's daughter Jade, who is thought to be seven months pregnant, was seen flying from Heathrow
 to Los Angeles on Saturday to join her father, and her step sisters 
Georgia May and Lizzie have been at his side since Scott's death last 
Monday.

Scott's 
assistant Brittany Penebre 
arrived in California on Monday and bumped into Randall Bambrough on 
Tuesday ahead of the funeral.

An unidentified source told the New York Daily News the service would be small.

'It will be an intimate service for close family and friends to pay their respects to L'Wren,' the source told the paper.
