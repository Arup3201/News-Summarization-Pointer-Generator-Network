A week-long heatwave along the Northeast Corridor is set to push the mercury far into the 90s from Monday, giving no respite from the weekend's stifling heat.

Heat index values - temperatures mixed with humidity - are expected to pass 100 degrees in cities including Philadelphia on Monday, with temperatures staying around 90 degrees even throughout the night.

As the East Coast braces for a scorching week, the National Weather Service has issued a heat advisory for the tri-state area, including New York City, most of Connecticut, Rhode Island, western parts of Boston and up into New Hampshire.

Middle ground: Chad Ohman takes advantage of the warm day to fish from a kayak on the Mississippi River Monday. A heat wave rages to the East and storms brew to the south while Mississippi Valley temperatures hover in the 80s

Providence, New York City, 
Philadelphia and Washington will see temperatures averaging in the 
mid-90s and could see the heat index values in the low 100s - the 
hottest week of the year so far.

The
 searing heat will be accompanied by largely stagnant, windless 
conditions, leaving Northeasterners without so much as an occasional 
cool breeze to take their minds off the heat.

For New York City and southern 
New England, this qualifies as a heat wave, which is three
 or more days with highs in the 90s. A trend expected to stretch into seven days.

A
 heat advisory is also in effect for northern and central New Jersey and
 parts of southeastern Pennsylvania, and an excessive heat warning is in
 effect for Philadelphia and Trenton.

According to CBS News, a
 heat advisory is announced when the heat and humidity combine to make 
it feel like at least 95 degrees out for two days on end or, 
alternatively, if the heat index reaches 100 to 104.

Be advised, this week’s heat wave will offer both.

‘It's
 going to be very hot and humid this week,’ said New York Mayor Michael 
Bloomberg. ‘The weather can be dangerous, especially for those without 
air conditioning, the elderly and those with chronic health conditions. 
There are about 425 cooling centers that we have open around the city 
for those needing relief from the heat.'

This overwhelming heat wave is expected to last until Sunday, when temperatures will drop to an average of the mid-80s.

Fire with fire: As they battled a house fire Monday, Scranton, Pennsylvania firefighters fought the blazing heat, too. Conditions aren't expected to improve for a full week

A cold front will 
gradually shove the hot, humid air to the south later this week, first nudging it from
 the southern Great Lakes on Friday and then the Ohio Valley and Northeast 
this weekend.

It is caused by a large dome 
of high pressure in the upper atmosphere, the Weather Channel said. It 
means that temperatures are 10 degrees above average.

People
 living in the affected areas should be careful to drink enough water 
and should avoid strenuous activity in the middle of the day. They 
should also wear hats and sunscreen lotion.

Lasting: This week is expected to bring more of the devastating temperatures seen Monday in a heat wave that's expected to pummel the East Coast with the summer's hottest days yet

Dangerous: Heat advisories were issued across the East Coast Monday during what is only the start of a dangerous heat wave expected to hold much of the country hostage for a week

Heat wave: Temperatures across the Eastern Corridor are set to stay in the 90s until Sunday, allowing no let up from the weekend's heat. Pictured, children play in Battery Park, New York this weekend

But
 it won't be just be the Northeast sweating through the week as parts of
 the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley - including Chicago, Detroit and 
Cincinnati - will also see temperatures in the low 90s.

Temperatures this month in the Northeast are several degrees above average due to a hot start to the month.

In southern New England, the average 
temperature so far this month is five to six degrees above average in 
Boston, Hartford and Providence, the Weather Channel reported.

Staying warm: Heat advisories are in place along the Northeast Corridor, where temperatures top the 90s

Enduring: The temperatures are only expected to drop into the 80s next Sunday, finally bringing some respite

The first 13 days of July have been three or four degrees above average in New York City, Newark and Philadelphia.

As the East overheats, other areas of the country are experiencing heavy rain.

Excessive
 rainfall in already well saturated areas of north-central Texas will 
likely produce another 1 to 3 inches of extra rain, and flash flood 
warnings are in place.

Showers and thunderstorms also threaten Nebraska, the Northern Plains and parts of Minnesota.

Top temperatures: A heat wave is qualified by three or more days of temperatures in the 90s

Oklahoma and Texas should expect continued storm conditions through Wednesday, and for temperatures to remain steady in the Lone Star State.

The Gulf Coast can also expect scattered showers through this week.

Meanwhile, down south, the Tennessee Valley will remain mostly dry along with the western Carolinas and the northern ends of Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama.
