Move over Nutella — a spread made out of Belgian crushed biscuits is acquiring cult British yummy-mummy status, and proving so addictive it’s been dubbed ‘crack in a jar’.

Such is the word-of-mouth success of Lotus Spread that sales of its smooth version have rocketed by 529  per cent in Sainsbury’s over the past year — and 276  per cent for a crunchier version — and both are zooming ‘relentlessly upward’ in Waitrose.

Now rival retailers are clamouring to stock the product, which is a spreadable version of the caramelised Lotus biscuits found worldwide, often as a complimentary nibble with a cup of coffee.

Hidden cost: Although Lotus Biscoff Spread is suitable for vegans and vegetarians, is dairy free and comes with no colouring or preservatives, there are a whopping 2,360 calories per 400g jar

The spread is made by Belgium’s Lotus Bakeries which annually manufactures six billion of the lightly spiced, thin and crunchy biscuits for export to 40 countries.

They are also known as Biscoff Biscuits — short for biscuits for coffee.

But beware — Lotus Spread may be just £2.29 in the shops but there is a hidden cost.

Although it is suitable for vegans and vegetarians, is dairy free and comes with no colouring or preservatives, there are a whopping 2,360 calories per 400g jar.
