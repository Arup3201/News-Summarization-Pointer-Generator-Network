Tragedy: Philip Townsend is to have been poisoned by carbon monoxide from an electricity generator

A wealthy British businessman and his wife have been found dead at their retreat in a remote Estonian forest.

Philip Townsend, 55, worked for a mysterious Moscow investment company, where he was an analyst in the lucrative but murky Russian telecoms industry.

Mr Townsend – who used the title Baron Townsend of Rathmore – and his British wife MaryAnne, 52, are believed to have been poisoned by carbon monoxide from an electricity generator at their secluded home.

Police in Estonia released no details of the tragedy until contacted by The Mail on Sunday, and say they do not yet know whether the deaths are suspicious.

Mr Townsend, who also owned a 16th Century manor house in Norfolk and a flat in Kensington, London, has been research director of Moscow-based Enza Capital since 2010.

Four years ago another wealthy British-based tycoon involved in the Russian telecoms industry vanished from his opulent holiday villa in Latvia.

Leonid Rozhetskin, 41, is presumed to have been targeted by an assassin.

But last night the Townsend  family said they believed this latest  incident – which leaves the couple’s two children, Edmund, 17, and  Octavia, 15, orphaned – to be a ‘tragic accident’.

Mr Townsend, who previously worked in London, is said to have typically spent the week in Moscow before returning home to Grade II listed Wood Dalling Hall, near  Aylsham, Norfolk, at weekends.

He died in a converted barn, which he is thought to have bought and renovated last year. The house is three miles down a dirt track near the town of Valga in southern Estonia.

Their only neighbour for miles, farmer Rein Rappo, 70, said he collected Mr Townsend from the Russian border on February 22  and drove him to the house. Mrs Townsend flew in from England the next day.

Mr Rappo said: ‘On the evening of February 23 they were visited by a friend. I believe it was the man who built the house. I woke up at 4.30am and noticed their lights were still on.

‘At 10am a workman arrived at their house and he found their bodies. He ran over to my house and told me what he had found. He had seen Mrs Townsend’s body near the front door. Mr Townsend’s body was by the electricity generator.’

When The Mail on Sunday visited the house daffodils and pink tulips had been left at the front door. The lounge, visible through the front window, appeared to have been left exactly as it was when they died. On the dining table was a half-empty bottle of red wine and two glasses, one half full, one empty.

Also on the table was a pair of reading glasses, a handbag, a pair of leather gloves, a compass, a cigarette lighter and a book entitled Estonia: Cultural Tourism.

A spokeswoman at Enza Capital declined to comment, saying: ‘We are not authorised to speak about his death.’ She also declined to give any information on the company.

A source at Renaissance Capital, a respected investment company in Moscow, said: ‘None of my colleagues has ever heard of Enza Capital. We have no idea what this company is doing.’

An Estonian police spokesman said the bodies were being examined by forensics experts and added: ‘No conclusion has been reached. There is no criminal investigation at this time. We are waiting for the post-mortem results.

‘If there is any evidence of foul play, we will investigate. Investigations at the scene show the building used an electricity generator, which was leaking gas. When officers arrived at the scene, they found the house filled with carbon monoxide.’

Mrs Townsend’s brother James Wilson, 49, a Norfolk farmer, said: ‘The children will be looked after by their relatives in Norfolk. The family request respect to be left alone to mourn this sad family tragedy.’
