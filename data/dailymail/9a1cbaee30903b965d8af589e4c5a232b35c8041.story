Beaming with joy, Michael Moloney celebrates his first birthday – a day his mother thought she would never see.

But her little boy defied the odds and doctors' warnings that he had no chance of survival.

Michelle Moloney was 18 weeks into her pregnancy when she felt his first kick. Hours later, joy turned to alarm as her waters broke.

Michael was eventually born at 26 weeks weighing just 1lb 12oz at University Hospital in Coventry

Doctors said she was likely to miscarry within ten days if she did not accept their offer to induce labour as a way to end the pregnancy. But she refused, and managed to stave off labour for eight more weeks.

Michael was eventually born at 26 weeks weighing just 1lb 12oz. Despite being premature he is now thriving, and the family held a birthday party for him on Thursday.

Mrs Moloney, 38, and her 36-year-old husband Scott, a project manager at a car firm, told the Mail how their 'emotional rollercoaster' began in January last year.

'I felt my baby kick in the early hours,' said Mrs Moloney, from Coventry. 'It was such a definite kick – the reassurance that every expectant mum longs for. Just a few hours later, my waters broke. I felt terrified.' 

Michael was born in the breech position and medics battled for 20 minutes to revive him - he has now celebrated his first birthday

Doctors said they could either induce labour or let nature take its course in up to ten days

Doctors at University Hospital Coventry said she had too little amniotic fluid, which is vital for the baby's development. The couple, also parents to Lilly, four, and two-year-old Patrick, were given the agonising news they were losing their child.

'It was absolutely devastating', Mrs Moloney said.

'The baby was very scrunched up and very tiny.' Doctors said they could either induce labour or let nature take its course in up to ten days.

'I could feel my baby move,' said Mrs Moloney. 'There was no way I could go through with an induction.'

She went home expecting to miscarry but the pregnancy kept progressing. At 24 weeks she was admitted to the hospital, where she stayed until she went into labour. Michael was born in the breech position and medics battled for 20 minutes to revive him.

Mrs Moloney said: 'Michael had lung damage. It was touch and go in the early days.'

She added: 'He's a miracle. I'm so thankful we have our little boy.'

A spokesman for the hospital said: 'We always consider the best interests of the baby.'
