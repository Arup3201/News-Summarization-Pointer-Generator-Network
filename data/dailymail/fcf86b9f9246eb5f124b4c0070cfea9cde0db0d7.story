Arsenal reached the landmark of scoring 1,500 Premier League goals on Saturday following the 2-0 victory over Sunderland.

Alexis Sanchez's double for Arsene Wenger's side at the Stadium of Light saw the Gunners become only the second Premier League club to reach the milestone.

With Thierry Henry, Ian Wright, Robin van Persie and Dennis Bergkamp among Arsenal's former lethal forwards, it's little wonder they're the second-highest scorers in Premier League history.

Arsenal's all-time top goalscorer Thierry Henry scored 175 times for the Gunners in the Premier League

Ian Wright beat Cliff Bastin's record number of goals in 1997 - the striker scored 104 Premier League goals

Dennis Bergkamp was a scorer of great goals as well as a great goalscorer during  eleven season with Arsenal

Incredibly, Thierry Henry is responsible for scoring more than 11 per cent of Arsenal's 1,500 Premier League goals.

It also comes as no surprise that Manchester United - Premier League winners on 13 occasions - lead the way when it comes to finding the back of the net in England's top-flight. The Red Devils have amassed an impressive 1,707 in the 'Goals For' column.

The partnership of Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke, the penalty-box ability of Ruud van Nistelrooy and the powerful pairing of Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney have all provided goals for Sir Alex Ferguson's title-winning sides over the years.

Special mentions must also be given to the likes of Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs who also popped up with their fair share of strikes.

However, Arsenal - scorers of sumptuous strikes and famed for free-flowing football under Arsene Wenger - are the Red Devils' closest challengers. 

Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney  played a huge part in maintaining United's place at the top of the table

Chelsea, who hold the record for the most number of goals scored in a single season, finding the net 103 times during the 2009-10 campaign (just one more than Manchester City managed last term) are the third highest scorers in the table.

Meanwhile, Liverpool, who finished second in the Premier League last season thanks to the goals of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, are the fourth highest scorers.

There's no doubting Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler and Steven Gerrard also scored a fair share of the Anfield side's 1,421 goals. 

Chelsea scored a record-breaking 103 goals on their way to winning the Premier League title in 2010

Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 53 goals  as Liverpool finished second in the Premier League last term

As expected, the Premier League's other ever-presents all make the top seven.

Tottenham, Everton and Aston Villa have all scored over 1,000 goals having spent the previous 22 seasons in the top-flight.

Newcastle and former Premier League champions Blackburn - two former clubs of the Premier League's all-time top scorer Alan Shearer, who found the net 260 times - sit eighth and ninth respectively in the table.

Manchester City, who have won the title twice in the last three years, are 10th in the all-time table (on points) but have actually scored 31 more goals than Blackburn, who are now playing in the Championship following relegation in 2012.
