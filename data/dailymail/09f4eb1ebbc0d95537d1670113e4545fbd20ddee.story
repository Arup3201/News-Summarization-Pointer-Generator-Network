A man's body was rejected from organ donation because he was gay, his partner has claimed.

Rohn Neugebauer, was just 48 and otherwise healthy when he died suddenly from a heart attack in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 16.

Just months before, he and his partner had held a fundraiser for the Center for Organ Recovery and Education at their hair salon, so his loved ones knew he'd want to donate his body to save others.

So they were stunned when CORE officials said he could not be a donor because of his sexuality.

Rejected: Rohn Neugebauer, 48, died suddenly from a heart attack two weeks ago - and his loved ones were shocked when they learned that he could not donate his tissue because he was gay

'It truly has me speechless,' his partner Dan Burda told CBS. 'I feel my corneas, 
skin and tissues are no different from any others... so why I'm different or why Rohn was any different is unacceptable.'

Neugebauer's sister, Sandy Schultheis, said that a CORE representative had asked her questions after the death, including if he had been in a homosexual relationship in the past five years.

When she revealed he had been in a relationship for the past eight, she learned that her brother would not be able to be a donor.

As Neugebauer suffered a heart attack, he would not have been able to donate his organs anyway - but he would still have been able to give his tissues, such as his skin and corneas, CBS reported.

CORE does accept organs from gay people because organs are considered life saving, but it does not accept tissues because they are considered 'life enhancing' - and therefore not worth the risk of infecting the recipient, CBS reported.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 'men who have had sex with another man in the preceding 5 years' 
should be excluded 'regardless of their HIV antibody test results'.

The CDC states that the risk for disease transmission is so high that donations from gay men should be rejected unless the situation is 'deemed to be greater than the risk of HIV transmission and disease' and the gay donor is the only option available.

Heterosexual donors do not face similar scrutiny over their sexual history.

CORE told WPXI that they could not comment specifically on the case but cited the FDA-mandated guidelines.

Rules: The Center for Organ Recovery and Education accepts organs from gay men but does not accept tissues from any man who has had sex with another man in the five years before their death

Fight: Neugebauer's loved ones are now hoping to change the rule, which they call prejudiced and outdated

After hearing the decision, Burda 
wrote on Facebook: 'I think it's very prejudiced, implying that 
basically that gay people all have AIDS and HIV.'

Burda, who raised $7,000 for CORE with Neugebauer before his death, is now fighting for a change in what he called an outdated policy.

'His strength is pushing me forward to do this,' he told CBS.

On a Change.org petition, he wrote: 'Rohn was my partner for 8 years, My Soul Mate. To have him not live on through others kills me. It's what he would have wanted. Shame on this Prejudice law.'

Neugebauer, who passed away in his 
partner's arms, was a decorated veteran, stock broker and realtor before
 setting up Studio Raw with Burda, according to his business bio.

CORE has more than 120,000 people waiting for life-saving organs.
