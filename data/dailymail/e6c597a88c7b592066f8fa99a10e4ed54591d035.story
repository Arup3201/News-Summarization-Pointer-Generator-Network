An elderly Pittsburgh man was killed - and his automobile incredibly split into two halves - when he plowed his fast-moving car into a pole in the downtown section of the city Friday morning.

'It looks like a horrific accident,' Pittsburgh Police Commander Eric Holmes reportedly said following the crash. 'You can tell it was quite an impact.'

An autopsy on Donald Fox, 80, was scheduled for Saturday, but authorities told Triblive.com after the accident that the deceased driver might have experienced a medical event at the time of the accident.

Fox reportedly hails from the Banksville neighborhood in the western section of Pittsburgh, and was headed into the city when the crash occurred.

'I'm just shocked,' Eric Damon told Triblive.com of the accident's aftermath. 'I never saw that before.'

Damon, a 34-year-old who hails from Lower Burrell, was reportedly working on the 19th floor of the nearby Gateway 4 building when he looked out his window and saw Fox lying motionless in the street.

Triblive.com cited police sources in saying that Fox was ejected from his vehicle after impact.

No one else was injured in the crash, which reportedly occurred around 10:40 a.m. Friday near the Gateway T Station on Liberty Avenue. The Gateway T Station is a well-populated stop on the city's light rail network.
