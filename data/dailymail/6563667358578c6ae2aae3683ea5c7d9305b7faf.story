He said: 'We 
received an emergency call at about 7.30am that a person had been found 
lying in the tiger pen and that three tigers were surrounding that 
person.

'The tigers attacked him and killed him. It is likely that a bite to the throat was the primary reason for his death.

'He has been in the water and the animals must have seen that and attacked him.'

Detectives are now trawling through CCTV footage to try to exactly establish how the man accessed the enclosure.

Steffen Straede, the zoo's chief executive, said psychologists have been called to talk to staff who found the body.

He added that this is the first incident of its kind in the zoo's 152-year history and that he has no plans to review security.

He said: 'If a person really wants to get in there, we cannot prevent it from happening.'
