The captain of the Costa Concordia was not wearing his glasses when the cruise ship crashed into rocks off the Italian coast, leaving more than 30 people dead, it was revealed yesterday.

According to leaked prosecution evidence, Ciro  Ambrosio, the first officer of the 114,000-ton liner, described how before the crash Captain Francesco Schettino had dined with Domnica Cemortan, a Moldovan cruise rep and dancer.

Ambrosio said in a statement: ‘Schettino wears glasses when he is tired. When he took command on the bridge he didn’t have them because he had left them in his cabin. He asked me to set the radar as he couldn’t see it properly.

‘Cemortan, the Moldovan, was on the bridge as well. She was speaking in English and arrived on the bridge the same time as Schettino. They exchanged a few words when they got on the bridge then she stayed in the background and didn’t speak.’

In further damning testimony against Schettino – dubbed Captain Coward for his alleged spineless behaviour during the tragedy – the first officer added: ‘The captain  told us not to tell the harbourmaster  anything about what had happened. He said to tell them everything was under control.’

Also in court documents is a statement from retired Costa Cruises captain Mario Palombo, who said  in a 2003 profile of Schettino that ‘professionally he is OK but he is a liar and he is too proud’. He also claimed that he had difficulty manoeuvring large ships.

The disclosures came at the opening of a preliminary inquiry into the tragedy in January, which is being held in the Italian town of Grosseto. Captain Schettino, 52, is under house arrest while investigators consider charges of multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, abandoning ship while passengers were still on board and failing to communicate with maritime authorities.

It was also disclosed that prosecutor
Francesco Verusio had asked for a new charge of ‘destroying a habitat’ 
to be brought against Schettino, because the Concordia ran aground in 
waters that are a protected maritime sanctuary and home to whales, 
dolphins and other sea life.

Schettino is said to have recklessly 
changed the course of the Concordia, which was packed with more than 
4,000 passengers and crew,  so that he could carry out a ‘sail-by 
salute’ of the Italian island of Giglio, but the vessel struck rocks, 
tearing a 75-yard hole in its hull.

Paolo Bastanini, one of Schettino’s 
lawyers, said: ‘My client is very upset by what happened. He is upset 
when he hears news that bodies have been found in the Concordia and he 
was very upset to hear the news that the body of a five-year-old girl 
was also recovered.’

Prosecutor Mr Verusio said that 
technical experts would examine the Concordia’s black box data recorder 
which registered the ship’s course and position.

He said: ‘The details will give us  a
new line of investigation and also help us to ascertain if others were 
also responsible for what happened that night.’

Besides Schettino, first officer 
Ambrosio and two other crew  members have also been placed under formal 
investigation as well as three officials from Genoa-based Costa Cruises.

Thirty-five British passengers and crew were on board the Concordia at the time.

Extra police have been drafted in to control onlookers at the hearing and they were warned it was a serious matter and not entertainment
