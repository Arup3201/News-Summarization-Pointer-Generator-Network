Papiss Cisse may get his desired move away from Newcastle this window, after a mystery Middle East club offered £8million for the Senegalese striker.

Turkish outfits Trabzonspor and Besiktas are also keen on Cisse, who wants to leave St James’ Park.

Despite the mysterious £8m from the Middle-Eastern suitors, Newcastle are hoping for a fee closer to £10m for the 28-year-old.

Outbound? Papiss Cisse is the subject of a £8m bid from a mystery Middle East club

Trazbonspor, who saw a £4million offer rejected last week, and Besiktas want to take Cisse on loan but now look set to miss out.

Qatari club Al Rayyan recently had a £7m offer rejected by the Magpies.

Cisse made a blistering start to his Newcastle career, scoring 13 goals in 12 games after his arrival from Freiburg in January 2012, but the Senegal striker has found the back of the net only once in the Premier League this season.
