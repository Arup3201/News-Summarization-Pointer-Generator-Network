Gareth Warburton has been kicked out of Wales' Commonwealth Games athletics team after testing positive for a banned substance.

The 800 metres specialist, who finished fourth at the 2010 Games in Delhi and would have been competing at his third Games, insisted he had 'not knowingly' taken any prohibited drugs and said the news had come 'as a great shock'.

Warburton has been charged with 'committing anti-doping violations' and suspended from the Wales team for the Commonwealths, but officials refused to divulge further details about the nature of his alleged offence when asked on Wednesday.

Suspended: Welsh 800m runner has been provisionally banned for a doping violation

All home nations athletes had to sign 
up to a mandatory anti-doping education programme as part of their 
selection for Glasgow 2014, but the charges against Warburton mean UK 
Anti-Doping has already failed in its ambitious bid to avoid a single 
positive drugs test at the Games, which open on July 23.

Warburton, a London 2012 Olympian and 
the fourth quickest Briton over 800m so far this year, has requested a 
full hearing before the National Anti-Doping Panel and apologised to his
 Welsh team-mates for missing the Games.

The 31-year-old from Caernarfon added:
 'The news of this anti-doping rule violation has come as a great shock 
to me. From the outset, I would like to state that I have not knowingly 
taken any banned substance.

'As a professional athlete, I have 
always supported and have been an advocate of clean sport. Nothing has 
changed in this regard.

'However, I recognise that the 
responsibility for this situation lies with me and I’m committed to 
working with UK Anti-Doping and will fully cooperate in the legal 
process.

Experience: Warburton finished fourth at the 2010 Games in Delhi and would have been competing at his third Games

'I’d like to take this opportunity to 
wish the best to all my team-mates heading to the Commonwealth Games and
 apologise that I won’t be able to join them as part of Team Wales.'

A Welsh Athletics statement said: 
'Welsh Athletics can confirm the provisional suspension of athlete 
Gareth Warburton after being charged with committing anti-doping rule 
violations under UK Athletics Anti-Doping Rules (presence of prohibited 
substances).

'Welsh Athletics strongly supports clean sport and has established a comprehensive education programme for its athletes.'

Mo Farah, meanwhile, has confirmed he 
will compete at the Commonwealth Games, but has withdrawn from a planned
 two-mile race at Sunday's London Anniversary Games to train at altitude
 in Font Romeu in France.

The 31-year-old's management company 
said Farah was 'healthy, back in full training and looking forward to 
the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow' after recovering from stomach pains 
last month.

The world and Olympic champion is due 
to go for gold in the 5,000m and 10,000m at Hampden Park, but it is 
still unclear whether he will attempt both events. The 5,000m is on 
Sunday July 27 and the 10,000m takes place on Friday August 1.

Top form: Farah will be hoping to secure another gold should he recover for the 5,000 and 10,000m
