Crowds once again lined the streets of Manila to see Pope Francis one final time as he made his way to the airport at the end of his visit to the Philippines.

Filipino President Benigno Aquino, catholic church leaders and hundreds of children saw the Pope off at Manila air base where the Pontiff, carrying his hand luggage, boarded a plane bound for Rome.

His departure followed yesterday's Mass in the nation's capital where a record six million gathered for prayers.

Biggest Mass ever? Six million gathered to see Pope Francis saying Mass in Manila, the Philippine capital, yesterday

Hundreds of thousands of Catholics gathered in the streets of Manila to get a final glimpse of the 78-year-old Pope as he was driven to the airport in his white Popemobile.

People shouted his name and wept in joy as he passed through the city's streets for the last time.

'He's my No. 1 world leader,' said Rita Fernandez, a 63-year-old mother-of-four.

'He rides on a bus. He flew to Tacloban to visit the typhoon survivors despite the storm and he stops to talk to the poor. He's a living saint.'

Those who were unable to squeeze through the roadside throng stood on top of ladders to unfurl posters proclaiming their love for the Pontiff.

Speaking at the airport, President Aquino said the Pope's five-day visit was a success. 

He said: 'He was very happy with the hospitality. He said he really felt the warmth.'

Pope Francis dedicated the trip to the Philippines to the poor, marginalised and victims of injustice. He denounced the corruption that has robbed them of a dignified life, visited street children and traveled to Tacloban to offer prayers for survivors of Typhoon Haiyan, the deadly 2013 storm that ravaged the city.

A record six million poured into Manila's rain-soaked streets and its biggest park yesterday as Francis ended his Asian pilgrimage, surpassing the five million who turned out for Pope John Paul II's Mass in the city in 1995. 

The Pope also dedicated the final chapter of his Asian trip to children as the Mass fell on an important feast day honouring the infant Jesus. His focus was a reflection of the importance the Vatican places on Asia as the future of the church since it is one of the few places where Catholic numbers are growing, with the Philippines the largest Catholic nation in the region.

'We need to care for our young people, not allowing them to be robbed of hope and condemned to a life on the streets,' Pope Francis said. 

The Pope's last full day in the Philippines began with a youth gathering at a Catholic university in Manila, where attendees were moved by a question posed by a 12-year-old orphan girl.

Glyzelle Iris Palomar asked him: 'Many children are abandoned by their parents. Many of them became victims and bad things have happened to them, like drug addiction and prostitution. Why does God allow this to happen, even if the children are not at fault? Why is it that only a few people help us?'

The girl, who was rescued and found shelter in a Church-run community, broke down in tears and could not finish her prepared welcome. The Pope hugged her and later put aside most of his own prepared speech to respond.

'She is the only one who has put forward a question for which there is no answer and she was not even able to express it in words but rather in tears,' he said, visibly moved.

'Why do children suffer?' the Argentine Pope said, speaking in his native Spanish. An aide translated his words into English for the crowd of about 30,000 young people on the grounds of the Church-run university.

'I invite each one of you to ask yourselves, "Have I learned how to weep, how to cry when I see a hungry child, a child on the street who uses drugs, a homeless child, an abandoned child, an abused child, a child that society uses as a slave?"' 

The crowd in Manila - a sea of humanity in colourful rain ponchos spread out across the 148-acre park - erupted in shrieks of joy when he drove by, a reflection of the incredible resonance Francis' message about caring for society's most marginal has had in a country where about a quarter of its 100 million people live in poverty.

In Sri Lanka, during the first leg of his Asian trip, Francis pressed his call for national reconciliation by canonizing the country's first saint, the Reverend Joseph Vaz, and visiting the war-ravaged north to pray at a shrine.

Reverend Vaz was a 17th century Indian missionary who revived the faith in Sri Lanka during a time of anti-Catholic persecution by Dutch colonists, who were Protestants.

Pope Francis said the Sri Lankan church today wants to continue Vaz's legacy of service to all, asking only for the freedom to preach in return. 'Religious freedom is a fundamental human right,' he said.
