Chris Woakes missed England training because of a stomach upset on Monday but is hoping to be available for the third one-day international against Sri Lanka in Hambantota.

Woakes has played in both matches so far, in which England have conceded a 2-0 lead with five to play.

But, like assistant coach Paul Farbrace, he felt unwell as the tourists made the road trip south from Colombo for Wednesday's third fixture.

The pace bowler sat out practice but still has two days to recover in time to feature at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium.

Should Woakes be unavailable, Ben Stokes - or possibly even Chris Jordan - might come back into contention for the third seamer's role, depending on conditions.
