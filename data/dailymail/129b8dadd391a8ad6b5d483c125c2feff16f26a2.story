April Dooley's three sons were born in roughly 4-minute intervals, last week on January 13th — at a combined weight of 14 pounds, 9 ounces. She named them Patrick, Owen and Liam.

The 42-year-old new mom says she burst into tears when she learned she was carrying a trio-to-be.

She and her husband, Brad, wanted their 5-year-old daughter Kaitlyn to have a companion at their home in Long Beach.

Mrs Dooley remembers the moment when she found out she was going to have triplets.

'My husband said, ‘Is that three?' I go, ‘Three what?' My husband said, ‘three babies.' I burst into tears,' she told the Orange County Register.

She said she and her husband wanted their daughter Kaitlyn, 5, to have a companion.

They weren't expecting their family to suddenly double in size. The couple didn't use fertility treatments, they said.

The occurrence of naturally conceived identical triplets is extremely rare.

Identical siblings are produced when an egg is divided in utero.

Doctors placed the odds at one in 1 million to one in 100 million.

'There was nothing out of the normal,' April said. 'We were trying for one more time. I had had two miscarriages. We were just trying one more time to get pregnant.'

Although the second-grade teacher said the prospect of three more children is daunting, she said, 'I would say it's a gift from God.'

Despite the rarity, it's the second known set of identical triplets born in California in several months.

Abby, Brin and Laurel Hepner were born Nov. 22 at Sutter Memorial Hospital to Hannah and Tom Hepner, of Quincy.
