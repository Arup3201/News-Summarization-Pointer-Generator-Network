These stunning photographs show a Chinese waterfall that has partially frozen mid-flow. 

The Hukou Waterfall, or Kettle Mouth Waterfall, has attracted thousands of tourists who marvel at the overspilling ice which formed after temperatures plummeted in Yichuan County.

The width of the waterfall changes with the fluctuating temperatures and rainfall. But it is usually nearly 100ft wide, increasing to more than 160ft during flood season. During the deep winter it can be reduced to a fraction of that scale.

The frozen Hukou Waterfall in China's Yichuan County has drawn thousands of tourists who marvel at the overspilling ice

The fascinating sight has superb contrast - while the overhang is frozen, the river gushes below, escaping the freeze

The scene looks almost surreal and offers keen photographers the perfect opportunity to get a stunning winter shot

Hukou literally means 'flask mouth' because the water hits a narrow section just before plunging over the 35ft edge, creating the appearance that it is being poured from a huge teapot.

A frigid autumn, a season in which the mercury rarely rises above freezing, has tamed the usually roaring rapids of the largest waterfall on China's Yellow River, and changed the landscape into a real winter wonderland.

The river originates in the Bayan Har Mountains and Anemaqen Mountains and empties into the Bohai Sea drain into the Hai River.

The scene near the waterfall is a real winter wonderland, where plummeting temperatures have seen large sections freeze over

The frozen waterfall looks almost like a series of fluffy clouds, and presents a spectacular addition to the landscape

By the time the water reaches the Hukou Waterfall, it has collected tonnes of fine-grained loess, a mineral-rich silt that has been deposited on land after being carried by the wind.

The tiny particles are continuously deposited along the bottom of its channel, causing natural dams to slowly accrue.

These subaqueous dams, which are unpredictable and generally undetectable, eventually burst, releasing enormous rushes of water which course along new flood planes to the sea.
