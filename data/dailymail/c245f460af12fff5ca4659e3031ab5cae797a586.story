Luis Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 1-0 victory against Italy on Tuesday has attracted headlines worldwide.

The incident is the third time that the Liverpool striker has been caught sinking his teeth into an opponent and the 27-year-old now faces disciplinary action from FIFA who have the power to ban him for up to two years.

But how significant is the story in Uruguay, Italy and Spain? Sportsmail takes a look at the front pages of their sporting publications on the forward.

Ignored: Luis Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini isn't mentioned in any of the Uruguayan front pages

What news? The Uruguayan papers focus on their country's 1-0 Group D win against Italy on Tuesday

Rather notably in Uruguay, the incident isn't mentioned anywhere in their front pages with the South American's qualification to the last-16 taking precedence.

La Republica headlines with 'Soul, heart and back' - referring to the body part that captain Diego Godin scored the match winning goal, while El Telegrafo goes with 'Heading to the Second Round!'.

La Diaria and and El Obsevrador also ignore Suarez's antics as the country prepares for their clash against Colombia on Saturday at the iconic Maracana Stadium.

Big deal? Tuttosport is the only Italian paper that marks Suarez's bite as a reason for their World Cup exit

Surprisingly in Italy, the incident plays second fiddle with all their papers' focus on the Azzurri's World Cup group exit.

It is the second time in succession that the four-time champions have bowed out early at the World Cup to the condemnation of their publications.

Only Tuttosport leads with Suarez as one cause for their exit in Brazil with the headline 'Godin and the referee send Uruguay into the knockout round as Suarez bites Chiellini.'

More pressing matters: Italy's World Cup exit in the group stage takes precedent over Suarez's bite on Chiellini in most of their Wednesday papers including La Gazzetta dello Sport (left) and Corriere dello Sport (right)

Elsewhere the story is just a side-note as the fallout on Italy's Group D demise begins.

Corriere dello Sport and La Gazzetta dello Sport focus on Claudio Marchisio's red card in the second-half as well as Cesare Prandelli's immeadiate resignation as national team coach and Giancarlo Abete's as president of the Italian FA.

Spanish paper AS slams Suarez for his actions. They lead with the headline 'Luis Suarez bites for a third time' with a picture of Chiellini showing the referee his attacked shoulder.

Man-eater: AS slam Suarez stating that the Barcelona and Real Madrid target has cannibalistic tendencies

The publication expands that further with it's front page depicting the previous two incidents that the forward has bit someone on a football pitch - in 2010 on PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal whilst at Ajax and last year on Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic for Liverpool.

The 27-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona in the past and AS adds that 'the number nine who the duo want has cannibalistic tendencies.
