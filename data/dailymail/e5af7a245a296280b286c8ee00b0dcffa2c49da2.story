The church defector, who released a tell-all book on her escape from Scientology in February, also claims Brad Pitt was courted by the church in the 90s and went through its drug detoxification program while dating actress and well-known Scientology member Juliette Lewis.

‘I know he was receiving Scientology auditing and was at one of the Celebrity Centre Galas,’ Hill told Radar Online in an exclusive interview posted Wednesday.

So why would Bono, a man known for his kindness and constant concern for humanity be in need of the church’s self-improvement techniques?

‘Scientology markets itself to everyone,’ Hill said in an exclusive interview with Radaronline. ‘It can deal with everything from marital problems to public speaking. He’s a human, so he still needs those things.’

As the daughter of Miscavige’s brother Ron, Hill spent her childhood in the church and detailed her time on the inside and with its ultra-secret Sea Org in a much ballyhooed recounting titled Beyond Belief: My Secret Life Inside Scientology and My Harrowing Escape.

She escaped to tell her tale only after 21 years, and Bono’s alleged courting by the mysterious organization comes as big a surprise as any she’s released.

‘If you’re egocentric, not always confident or insecure because of being in public eye and want to be charitable, Scientology pushes your buttons,’ explains Hill, ‘That’s why someone like Bono would fit the bill perfectly.’

According to Hill, it’s the celebrity that entices church officials like her uncle.

More woes: The church has seen a number of troubles recently. Last month, Leah Remini defected from the church and stirred trouble with a quickly dismissed missing persons report about Miscavige's wife

‘There’s a celebrity strategy and they’re targeted for their influence, not their money,’ she says, ‘They know people are obsessed with celebrities so will get more interested in Scientology.’

Another celebrity she claims was sought out by the church: Brad Pitt.

Pitt’s name has come up in reference to Scientology before thanks to his relationship with actress Juliette Lewis, who remains a Scientologist to this day.

Hill says Pitt was involved with the church’s drug detoxification program called Purification Rundown to help him stop using drugs he’s publicly blamed battles with depression, according to Radaronline.

Lewis, too, says she has the church to thank for helping her kick a drug habit.

Hill’s new revelations concerning the church of her upbringing are just a drop in the bucket of Scientology’s recent woes.

Just this past Friday, MailOnline exclusively revealed photos of the Church of Scientology's 'alien space cathedral' built in a remote part of the New Mexico desert.

The mysterious building leads to an underground vault which sits next to two giant symbols carved into the ground - believed to be markers for the religion's followers to find their way back from the ends of the universe after humanity is destroyed in the future. 

While no one knows the definite meaning of the pair of overlapping circles, each with a diamond in them, it is believed to have been trademarked by the Church of Technology, a branch of Scientology.

It is believed that they are a ‘return point’ so members of the church know where they can find the works of founder L. Ron Hubbard when they come back from space after a nuclear catastrophe wipes out the human race.

And last month, actress Leah Remini made headlines by fleeing the church. She subsequently piqued public interest in the church again by filing a missing persons report on Miscavige’s wife Shelly, who hasn’t been seen publicly in years.

Remini has reportedly been offered ‘millions of dollars’ for a tell-all book on her many years with the church.

The Church of Scientology did not immediately return emails or calls for comment on Hill’s accusations.

However, a church spokesperson told Radar Online:

‘At no time was Mrs. Hill ever privy to any ‘priorities’ or ‘strategies.’ As a result, she is in no position to comment and any claims to the contrary must be viewed with skepticism. Our priorities are and always have been the establishment and expansion of the Scientology religion.’
