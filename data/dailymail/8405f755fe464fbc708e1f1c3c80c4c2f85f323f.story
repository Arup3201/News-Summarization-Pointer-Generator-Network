They may like a little va va voom but French cars will no longer be powered by diesel if the country's prime minister gets his way. 

As part of a wider environmental effort to be launched next year, Manuel Valls said France was overly reliant on the fuel and pledged to wean the country off it.    

'In France, we have long favored the diesel engine,' he said. 'This was a mistake, and we will progressively undo that, intelligently and pragmatically.' 

Around 80 percent of cars run on diesel in France, where the fuel is currently around 15 percent cheaper than petrol. Most European countries have similar policies because diesel cars are typically more efficient

French prime minister Manuel Valls said France's favoring of the diesel engine was 'a mistake' 

More than 30 million cars currently run on diesel in France today, according to the latest figures from the World Bank - approximately 80 percent of the total on the road.

While French car ownership fell by almost 25 percent between 2007 and 2013, 86 percent of all French households still own a car. 

Unlike Britain where diesel prices are higher, the fuel is less expensive than petrol in France where the current tax system makes the fuel about 15 percent cheaper.

Most European countries have similar policies because diesel cars are typically more efficient than their petrol counterparts. 

With the focus shifting from economy to air pollution, as of next year all French cars will be subject to a pollution rating which will facilitate the banning of the dirtiest cars from towns and cities. 

At present diesel costs around 1.25 euro, or 99p a liter, but as of next year the tax on diesel will also rise by around a penny, generating around £1.2 billion in revenue for the government.

This will add around 50p to the price of a full tank for medium car owners and 70p for large car owners.   

However, drivers who trade their gas guzzlers for electric cars could get up to £8,600 in incentives for making the switch.
