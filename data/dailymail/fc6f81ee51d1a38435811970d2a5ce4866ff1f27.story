As a teenager Lauren Hill had always been short for her age.

For the gymnast her growth spurt came later in life, when last year, as a 15-year-old she suddenly shot up six inches in just two months.

But with it came a devastating blow to her dreams of competing on the world stage.

Lauren was diagnosed with scoliosis - an abnormal curvature of the spine.

Her mother, Alison, said experts revealed the condition had been caused by her daughter's rapid growth, leaving her spine bent at 45 degrees and resembling the shape of a 'c'.

The teenager faced the heartbreaking reality of having to give up the sport she had loved since the age of two. 

But today Lauren is back in training, preparing for the World Championships in China next year after experts helped straighten out her back with daily physiotherapy sessions.

Teenage gymnast Lauren Hill was diagnosed with scoliosis - an abnormal curvature of the spine - last year, after she went through a growth spurt and shot up six inches in the space of two months. Her spine was left bent at a 45 degree angle, right, resembling a c-shape, her mother Alison said

The condition threatened Lauren's career as a gymnast, preventing her from performing certain routines. But thanks to daily treatment, the 16-year-old is now standing tall and back in training. She is pictured with her physical therapist Michael Bradley

Ms Baker, 47, left with her daughter, said: 'She (Lauren) had a big growth spurt in 2014. She was short for her age and developed much later because of her sport, so when she grew five or six inches in a month it caused her spine to curve off in this c-shape'

Her mother, 47, from Feltham in Middlesex, said: 'Acrobatics is Lauren's whole life, so it was so hard when we thought she'd have to stop - it really is everything to her so she was really upset.

'She had a big growth spurt in 2014. She was short for her age and developed much later because of her sport, so when she grew five or six inches in a month it caused her spine to curve off in this 'C' shape.

'The exercises she does now are specific to the individual and make the person really aware of their condition.

'Lauren now does 45 minutes of exercises per day - it's signing up to a different way of life but it's a small price to pay for something that improves her condition, halts progression of it and reduces pain as well.'

Lauren's coach first noticed something was wrong when he saw her hips and shoulders appeared uneven, with one shoulder blade protruding. 

Her mother took the teenager to the GP, where she was initially diagnosed as having one leg shorter than the other.

But Lauren began to suffer a lack of flexibility and agonising pain that prevented her from performing specific routines.

On returning to hospital again, specialists diagnosed her with scoliosis. 

Ms Hill said she was told her daughter faced an operation to surgically straighten her spine.

But the procedure would have put an end to Lauren's acrobatics for good.  

Ms Baker said: 'When I questioned the consultant over whether Lauren would still be able to participate in acrobatics or any other sport he replied "she will only have flexibility at the base of her spine and will be able to swim".

Determined, Lauren refused surgery, deciding to look at alternative therapy with her mother instead.

Scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an S-shape.

Signs include a visible curve in the spine, one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other, clothes not handing properly and back pain.

Pain usually only affects adults with the condition.

In most cases, the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy.

In the UK, scoliosis affects three to four children could of every 1,000.

It is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis.

It is more common in women than in men.

Most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows.

However, in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing.

Occasionally, a child needs surgery to straighten their spine.

In adults, it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain.

Lauren said: 'I was trying to train for the world championships when I found out I had scoliosis and it hurt so much. 

'There were points where I thought I wouldn't be able to carry on, but I still would have hated surgery because I knew the outcome to that would not have necessarily been good either.'

Ms Baker then discovered Scoliosis SOS - the only clinic in the world to offer treatment following the ScolioGold method, which is the combination of non-surgical treatments. 

While undergoing treatment, Lauren was taught a customised exercise programme specific to her condition over a span of four weeks.

Charlie Meekings, patient care co-ordinator at Scoliosis SOS Clinic, said: 'It is important to know that there are other effective treatments available for scoliosis, not just those provided by the NHS.

'However, due to current legislation many health professionals are unable to disclose or discuss treatment options outside of the public sector.

'Our clinic prides itself on our ability to give free, impartial advice with no obligation to visit the clinic.'

Lauren will now be trialing for a place to represent Team GB at the European Acrobatics and Gymnastics Championship in Germany later this year.

Ms Baker said: 'She now has her eyes set on another World Championship trophy in China next year: something that seemed impossible only four weeks ago.'
