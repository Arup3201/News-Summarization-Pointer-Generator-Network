A German court has ruled that a young Muslim girl must attend mixed swimming lessons at her school wearing a 'burkini' - a full-bodied costume which includes a head-covering.

The ruling is an important one for the country which has over 5million Muslims, most of them Turks, in the population.

The girl had complained that she felt 'uncomfortable' going swimming with 'bare chested' boys near her and either wanted to be allowed to skip the lessons or be given special instruction on her own.

A 13-year-old Muslim girl has been ordered by a German court to wear a bukini to take part in swimming lessons. Bukinis, modelled above in a London shop, allow Muslim women to swim and still cover up

But the Federal Administrative Court in the eastern city of Leipzig has ruled that 'social reality of life in Germany came above her religious beliefs'.

They said the coverall swimsuit was the best solution for the girl, 13, and noted that several of her friends at the school in Frankfurt already donned burkinis to swim.

The girl, whose family come from Morroco, was represented by a lawyer in Wednesday's hearing who said that according to the Koran, she was not only forbidden from showing herself to boys but also from seeing the topless boys.

But the court said: 'The plaintiff has not made sufficiently clear that taking part in co-educational swimming lessons with a burkini breaches Muslim rules on clothing,' rejecting her appeal against earlier decisions by two courts in the western state of Hesse.

A judge at the Federal Administrative Law Court, in Leipzig, Germany, has set a precedent by ordering a teenage Muslim girl to take part in swimming lessons wearing a burkini

Judge Werner Neumann said an education system in a pluralistic society could not accommodate every religious concern, and the burkini would accommodate the girlâ€™s Muslim beliefs.

'The result would be the widespread disintegration of lessons otherwise,' he added.
