About 35 per cent of Australians admit they will buy gifts out of pure obligation this Christmas

As Christmas edges nearer and the shopping list of presents grows longer, millions of Australians will find themselves obli-gifting this festive season. 

A global Christmas survey of over 12,000 people by Groupon revealed that 35 per cent of Australians admitted they buy gifts out of pure obligation.

The average Australian will not only purchase at least three obli-gifts this Christmas season, but they'll spend about $150 doing so, amounting to $855 million worth of obli-gifts being received across the country.

Serial obli-gifter, Kate Hoyle, from Camden in New South Wales, told Daily Mail Australia that she spends at least $200 each Christmas, buying presents for people who she'd prefer not to buy anything for.

'A lot of it comes from when I'm catching-up with people before Christmas and you're in that 'I don't know if you're going to buy me something or not but I don't want to be the awkward one who doesn't have anything to give,' situation Mrs Hoyle said.

The mother-of-three recalled how she was caught out one year when her neighbour's children arrived to her doorstep, bearing presents for her own children.

'I just ran inside and grabbed a gift I'd bought for my son – and luckily it had already been wrapped – and handed it over to them,' Mrs Hoyle laughed.'

'Because they were kids, the pressure was on to perform. It's just my nature; I'd rather feel good about it than worry about my money.

'These days, we are such a materialist society that there are certain things you would buy for your kids just because you want to fill up their sack or give them a lot of things to unwrap.

'That concept that your always looking for things to buy rather than buying what they want or need, that's part of obli-gifting too really.'

At least 57 per cent of Australians, most of them no doubt on the receiving end of an obli-gift, admitted to re-gifting an unwanted present.

Meanwhile, about 55 per cent of respondents who forgot someone on their present list, confess that they prefer to lie, with the most popular excuse being that the receivers non-existent present had been bought online, with the post office copping the blame.
