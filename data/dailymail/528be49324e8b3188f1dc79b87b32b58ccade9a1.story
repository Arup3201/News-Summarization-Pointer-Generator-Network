Prediction: Ed Davey

A Liberal Democrat Cabinet minister has predicted that his party will enter coalition with Labour after next year’s general election.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey, who is on the right of his party, said he believes Labour will be the largest party after the election in May and that the Lib Dems will enter power-sharing talks with them.

At a conference organised by the Lib Dem Social Liberal Forum in London at the weekend, Mr Davey suggested that the Lib Dems would use their experience to extract a better deal than they did in 2010.

‘If we were negotiating again and I hope we will be, but probably with the Labour Party this time... that would be my prediction, I think because we are used to coalition politics, we would negotiate even better,’ the minister said, according to a transcript of the event obtained by the Huffington Post UK website.

His intervention let slip what many senior Lib Dems are saying privately – with Labour and the Lib Dems quietly aligning policy pledges in more than a dozen areas, apparently in readiness for a potential power-sharing deal.

There are now many areas where their policies have converged, including preserving the Human Rights Act, scrapping Conservative tax breaks for married couples, cutting pensioner benefits and imposing a mansion tax on expensive homes.

Ed Miliband has announced that he will only support an EU referendum following any new transfer of powers from Britain to Brussels.

This is something no-one is contemplating so effectively rules out a referendum. The stance is identical to that of the Lib Dems.

Although the Lib Dems are flatlining in national opinion polls, most pollsters think they have every chance of hanging onto enough seats to hold the balance of power once more.

Policies both parties support

Nick Clegg has suggested the Lib Dems would be willing to work with either the Tories or Labour in the event of another hung Parliament, and has made strenuous efforts to suggest his party will be ‘equidistant’ between the two.

But some senior Lib Dems fear voters would be so enraged by the party jumping straight from coalition with the Tories to Labour that they would be ‘wiped out’ in the 2020 general election.

Senior Labour figures are split over whether to prepare for the possibility of a pact.

* Lib Dem voters prefer David Cameron as Prime Minister to their own leader, a poll has found.

Thirty-five per cent thought Mr Cameron was the best choice, compared with 34 per cent who said Mr Clegg would be better, according to the survey carried out by former Tory party chairman Lord Ashcroft.
