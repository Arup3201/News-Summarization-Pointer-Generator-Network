The Prime Minister’s anti-poverty tsar has accused David Cameron of wasting the first half of his term in government by ignoring a study into how to smash the cycle of deprivation.

Frank Field said Mr Cameron had squandered two years by failing to implement any of his suggestions.

The former welfare minister said the Prime Minister ‘has yet to show he has even read’ the study he commissioned into bridging the class divide for youngsters.

The maverick Labour MP called for a dedicated Cabinet Minister to take charge of all policy for the under-fives, saying so far the coalition had failed.

The government’s dithering had led to a ‘lost opportunity’ to ensure that children from low income families did not go on to fail at school.

Mr Field’s ground-breaking study, commissioned by Mr Cameron, warned that children’s life chances were almost entirely determined before they even got to school.

His report called for health visitors to measure children’s behaviour and communication skills from the age of two to catch youngsters who were falling behind in their development.

The MP for Birkenhead also called for
parenting classes to be offered in schools.So far, however, his 
suggestions had only been taken seriously by a few keen civil servants, 
he said.

Mr Field told the Daily Mail: ‘This 
is a missed opportunity. I am puzzled as to why the Prime Minister would
be so anxious for me to do all this work when he has yet to show that 
he has read it.

‘Time is running out, we are coming up to halfway in this parliament.

‘If the Prime Minister had hit the ground running from day one two years ago, they [the coalition] could have said, ‘we may have made a mess of things in these other areas but at least we are trying really hard on this’. ‘

He added: ‘This report was about giving the Prime Minister a flagship policy which would have taken politics into a new era. He needs to get on with it.

‘It would have raised voters’ morale, so they could have felt that despite all this mess, we know they are sorting out life chances and they are on the right track.’.

Downing Street dismissed the criticism, saying the Prime Minister took tackling poverty very seriously.

A source close to Mr Cameron said: ‘Of course the Prime Minister is committed to trying to reduce poverty. This Budget was about taking many of the poorest people out of tax altogether. A lot of the Queen’s Speech will also be focused on the family.’

Mr Field’s paper ‘The Foundation Years: preventing poor children becoming poor adults’ revealed that many children begin school without knowing their first name because their parents barely speak to them.

One of his most damning findings was that youngsters who were behind when they started school never caught up to their peers.

He blamed the situation on the low aspirations of parents trapped in poverty where no one in the family has worked for generations.

These parents do not bother to play with, talk to or read to their children. Education experts also blamed the arrival of the internet which they say has contributed to a fall in verbal communication in many households.

The government is expected to miss its target, of ensuring that no more than 1.7 million children live in poverty. This is despite successive governments spending £150 billion on tackling poverty since 1997.

Child poverty is also measured against median earnings and the recession should have made the problem easier to mask, Mr Field said.

The former minister argued for poverty to be measured against other indicators such as parenting and the quality of childcare rather than just income.

He said that the Labour policy of ‘income transfers on a massive scale did not work’.

When his report was published in December 2010, it was welcomed by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg as a ‘hugely valuable contribution’ to the coalition Government’s drive to end child poverty by 2020.
