A ten-year-old boy has highlighted the anti-social behaviour in his town by drawing a scene from his bedroom - and it includes a prostitute, a man urinating and a fight.

The unnamed youngster lives in the once-prosperous resort of Boscombe in Bournemouth, Dorset, that is now blighted by problems including drug dealing.

The schoolboy drew the picture and his father handed it to a local newspaper to highlight the anti-social issues facing the town.

Through child's eyes: The drawing shows a man fighting with a bottle and a knife, a woman with money stuffed in her stocking, and a sad-looking child and the boy's father is using it to highlight antisocial issues

The drawing shows a man fighting with a bottle and a knife, a woman with money stuffed in her stocking, and a sad-looking child.

Once Boscombe was the chosen destination for the well-heeled Victorians who erected large churches as a signpost for their morals.

But now the prostitutes, drug addicts and general violence have become major issues, despite valiant efforts to improve the area through investment and charity.

But the boy’s drawing shows there is a long way to go, and it depicts a scene that could be witnessed in any large town or city across the country.

The child, who lives near the town's red light district, said: 'I see all these people out of my window all the time, sometimes I tell my dad, sometimes I just watch them.'

His father said: 'He sees prostitutes regularly and the people fighting with the bottle. He’s seen people urinating in the graveyard at St Clement’s church.

'The children often get woken by shouting and screaming and witness women being picked up in cars, a lot of aggressive men are around all the time.'

Boscombe resident Chris Thompson, 22, who grew up in the area, said: 'You see lots and lots of fights between groups of lads.

'When you are little all this frightens you, you feel shocked.'

Joey Robinson, 28, a father of two girls aged eight and three, said: 'You see a lot of drinkers here and you see prostitutes all the time.

'You want to get your children away from that. I came here from Tottenham in north London and I find it worse here than certain parts of Tottenham.

'I didn’t believe it was like this.'

Andy Williams, Bournemouth council’s safer communities manager, said: 'There are a number of activities taking place to target those who are responsible for anti-social behaviour in Boscombe including increased CCTV to tackle prostitution.'

Superintendent Nicky Searle, of Dorset police, said the force had staged a number of operations in the area to tackle drug-dealing and prostitution.
