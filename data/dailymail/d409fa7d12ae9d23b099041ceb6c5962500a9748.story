A publicity stunt that involved releasing thousands of butterflies at a Chinese science exhibition to raise awareness of conservation backfired badly - after thousands of the insects were killed.

The incident took place in Xingxiang in central China's Henan Province during the Butterfly Popular Science Exhibition, organised by a museum in the city.

During the event more than 10,000 rare butterfly specimens of various species from around the world were on display.

Poorly thought-out: Thousands of butterflies were killed during a conservation event in Xinxiang, China. The insects were released but many injured by crowds eager to hold them

Ironic: The aim of the butterfly release was to highlight conservation efforts

The organisers also released thousands of butterflies to promote the idea of environmental awareness. But, instead of protecting them, visitors started to fight to capture the flying butterflies, causing many of the creatures to be crushed or injured.

Amazingly, something similar happened during an event to showcase the natural beauty of land earmarked for a new property development earlier this month.

A company bought land on the outskirts of the city of Wuhan in  China's Hubei Province and hoped to attract potential buyers by highlighting the area's natural environment, far away from the smog of the city.

The region of rolling hills and woodland is named Butterfly Valley, and so the developers decided that a Butterfly Festival would be the perfect way to showcase the region.

The only problem was most butterflies hatched in the area in early spring and the last ones had already died around June.

So instead they contacted specialist breeders and arranged for thousands of butterflies from more than 800 different species to be shipped in.

Some were released by members of the public, while others were kept in special netted tents for the amusement of visitors.

However, not only did many of the butterflies get injured in transit and die shortly after they were released, but others succumbed to the unseasonal weather and expired after a few days.

So instead of the sight of butterflies fluttering over the valley or being snapped by happy visitors, Chinese social media was flooded with images of dead and dying exotic butterflies falling from the sky or being trampled underfoot.

It sparked a wave of protest from China's small but increasingly vocal animal rights activists who said the whole idea was 'cruel and pointless'.

The PR agency that organised the stunt said they had asked visitors not to touch or play with the butterflies, and that the only reason they were dying was because they had a short lifespan.
