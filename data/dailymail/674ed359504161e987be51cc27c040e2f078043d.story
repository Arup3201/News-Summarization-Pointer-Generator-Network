Huge queues were building up at Heathrow Airport this morning after half of all the immigration desks were shut - even though the Olympics are just weeks away, it has emerged. 

Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said he was appalled at the length of 
queues when he visited the airport at 7am this morning.

Official figures showed the wait at immigration control for non-EU passengers was 56 minutes despite a 45 minute target.

The queues don't bode well for the huge numbers of people who will be coming through the airport in two weeks time for the London Olympics, as well as Brits going and returning from their summer holidays.

Mr Vaz's comments come after shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper 
said it was a disgrace that international athletes were waiting longer 
than two hours to pass through immigration control.

And, just last week chaotic 
scenes were photographed at the airport, with a sea of 
stressed passengers forced to wait in queues stretching half a mile to 
get through immigration control.

The Immigration Service Union, which represents 4,500 border staff, said at the time
 that the problems were made worse as only about half the 
current workers were fully trained to allow passengers from anywhere in 
the world entry.

Visit: Keith Vaz said he was appalled at the length of the queues at Heathrow this morning

In April Labour published leaked figures showing 800 UK Border Force 
posts have been cut in the past two years – 10 per cent of the total – 
with another 700 set to go by 2015.

At
 the time, ministers said they would draft in more than 550 volunteers 
to help stem the chaos during the Olympics, but they will receive just 
four days training on how to operate passport controls.

Mr Vaz said: 'I was appalled by the length of queues in the immigration hall this morning.

'It is now two months since the Immigration Minister promised additional resources and better management.

'The
 worst aspect was that half of the immigration desks were simply not 
opened even though the Border Force had prior knowledge of all flight 
arrivals.

'This creates additional security 
pressures with luggage piling up in the baggage hall. We look forward to
 hearing the Immigration Minister’s explanation for this tomorrow.'

A Border Force spokesman insisted Mr Vaz was incorrect.
'Queues at Terminal 4 remained under an hour at all times,' he said.

'Staff were quickly redeployed and more than 80 per cent of desks were open to process passengers as quickly as possible.'

Yesterday, Ms Cooper said many of 
those forced to wait in long queues were Olympic athletes, who will be 
arriving ahead of the opening ceremony on July 27 to acclimatise to UK 
conditions.

A leaked memo 
reveals that tourists arriving from outside the European Economic Area 
are repeatedly waiting longer than the 45-minute target time to pass 
through passport control.

Meanwhile, European visitors are waiting 40 minutes when it should take less than 25 minutes to have their documents checked.

Ms Cooper accused Home Secretary Theresa May of failing to ensure enough staff were employed at peak times.

She added: 'These figures are a disgrace. With just
 three weeks to go until the Olympics people are waiting more than two 
hours at Heathrow, and the targets for Terminal 4 have been breached on 
26 of the last 30 days.

'The Home Secretary ought to be able to make sure there are proper 
security checks without long queues. After all, there has been long 
enough to prepare for the Olympics.

'Instead, she has cut 900 Border Agency staff and these documents show there are still too few staff in place at peak times.'

Not happy: Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it was a 'disgrace' athletes had to wait while immigration minister Damien Green must explain why

But Mr Green said the Government’s 
actions to tackle queues 'have resulted in real improvement over the 
last two months - including consistently hitting our targets on UK and 
EU passengers and reducing waiting times across the board'.

'But
 we’re not complacent about some long waiting times, which is why this 
weekend we have increased staffing numbers by more than 50 per cent at 
Heathrow to respond to large passengers volumes,' he said.

'And by the start of peak Olympic arrivals in less than 10 days, there will be up to 500 additional staff on our rotas across the country - this includes enough staff at Heathrow to cover every desk during busy times.

'Additionally we have special lanes in place designated to Olympic athletes to enable them to pass through the border without delay.'

Despite the queues, Heathrow itself - which is not in charge of immigration -  seems to be going to great lengths to welcome athletes arriving in the country.

A series of Olympics greeting desks manned by five members of staff have been rolled out across the airport.

The airport is also
 recruiting 1,000 volunteers from local communities who, among other 
things, will wave off each flight leaving Heathrow after the Games.

The airport is also building a special
 terminal for athletes departing from the Olympics. It will be the same 
size as the Paralympic seven-a-side football pitch and have 31 check-in 
desks and seven security lanes.

August 13 will see more passengers and bags than Heathrow has ever had in a single day.

The airport expects to process 
137,800 people leaving on that day, and 200,000 bags instead of an 
average of 150,000 on a normal day.

A spokesman for airport operator BAA 
said: 'Immigration waiting times for passengers during peak periods at 
Heathrow in the last few days have been unacceptably long and the Home 
Office should be delivering a good experience for regular passengers as 
well as for Olympic visitors.'

He went on: 'Immigration is a matter 
for the Home Office. The Home Office has said that from July 15 all 
Border Force desks at Heathrow will be open during peak Olympic arrival 
periods.'
