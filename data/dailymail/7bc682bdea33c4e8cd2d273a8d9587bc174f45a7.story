A couple now weigh less than when they got married 20 years ago after shedding 10 stone between them.

Graeme Wharton, 42, and his 41-year-old wife Lisa finally faced up to the reality of how big they had become when they couldn't fit into their outfits at Christmas 2012.

But things have changed and now they are celebrating winning Slimming World’s Couple of the Year just in time for their 20th wedding anniversary.

Lisa's weight crept up to 15st 6.5lbs and a size 20, while Graeme tipped the scales at 19st 10lbs with a hefty 48in waist

They started slimming after Graeme was 
forced to go home and change into jogging bottoms at Christmas 2012 because he was 'spilling out' of his best trousers.

The Sunderland couple met in 1989 when Lisa was just 16 and Graeme was 17 and married five years later with the bride in a Size 18 dress, while the groom wore a 48 inch waist suit.

Their two children - Jack, now 18, and Alice, now 15, - came along and Lisa’s weight crept up to 15st 6.5lbs and a size 18/20, while Graeme tipped the scales at 19st 10lbs with a hefty 48in waist after over indulging on treats including ready meals and tea and biscuits.

But eventually the couple replaced frozen lasagnes and pies with homemade goodies as well as pasta salad and fruit - and lost 10st 4lbs between them.

Lisa shed 4st 12lbs and now weighs in at 10st 8.5lbs and wears a svelte Size 12, while her hubby lost 5st 6lbs to weigh 14st 4lbs and fits into a 34ins waist.

Breakfast now includes poached eggs with beans on wholemeal toast or a big bowl of fresh raspberries with fat free yogurt instead of cereal with milk.

Old habits of eating ham sandwiches on buttered white bread with a side of crisps and chocolate for lunch have been replaced by homemade pasta salad with chicken or tuna, spring onions, peppers and sweetcorn.

Frozen pizzas for dinner have been swapped for spaghetti and meatballs and a large salad, while the pair enjoy a mid-morning snack of fruit and mid-afternoon high-fibre cereal bar instead of biscuits.

The slimmers have even replaced a normal cup of tea with milk for fruit or green tea - but still enjoy a beer at the weekend.

Teacher Lisa said: 'My family always described me as ‘from good stock’ or ‘big boned’ and Graeme was just told he had puppy fat so neither of us worried too much about our size. 

Lisa and Graeme celebrate as they are named Slimming World couple of the year just in time for their 20th wedding anniversary

'I suppose when we got together we were happy and content, and like a lot of couples that saw us gain more weight.

'I always say we were blissfully ignorant because we were young and content, we didn’t realise how big we were or the health implications of our weight.

'We didn’t think about what we were eating and just concentrated on enjoying our children.'

In 2006 Lisa joined Slimming World and dropped 4st 7lbs, but when she stopped attending the weekly group because of work commitments, she struggled to keep up the healthy eating and piled the pounds back on.

But when her clothes began getting tight in January 2013, Lisa decided to join her local group in Sunderland under the watchful eye of Consultant Wendy George, along with cab driver Graeme.

He said: 'The turning point for me came on Christmas Day 2012.

'We got dressed up for dinner, put our gladrags on as you do, but I felt so uncomfortable in my smart trousers and shirt because they were tight and I felt like I was spilling out over my trousers.

'I ended up going home to put my joggers on and that’s when I knew I needed to do something.'

The determined couple followed Slimming World’s Food Optimising healthy eating plan and started cooking from scratch - roping the kids into their changing their diets too.

Graeme said: 'We share the cooking and it’s so much more satisfying than ripping off some plastic and popping something in the microwave - my specialty is tomato and basil soup.'

The newly slim pair say they are happier and healthier than ever

The couple have even signed up for the Great North Run in September, with Graeme running for Meningitis Now and Lisa fundraising for Sunderland Football Club’s Foundation of Light.

Lisa added: 'We’ve got our wedding anniversary and the Great North Run this year, and now winning Couple of the Year makes it even more special.

'We’re just looking forward to the next 20 years of marriage and all that it holds now we’re healthier and fitter than ever.'
