In Africa, rhino populations are being pushed to extinction by the sickening trade in their horns for use in Eastern ‘medicine’.

But it’s not just animals in the wild that are being threatened by the poachers.

According to police, the hunters also have the zoos of Kent in their sights.

At risk: Black rhinos at Port Lympne zoo in Kent may be targeted by poachers for their horns

As a result, the Aspinall Foundation, which has bred 33 black rhinos in the last seven years at its Port Lympne and Howletts wildlife parks, is seeking volunteers to help mount 24-hour security operations to protect its animals.

The warning from Kent police wildlife officer Michael Laidlow follows those by the World Worldlife Fund that all rhino horns on animals alive or dead are potentially at risk.

Poaching has rocketed in line with the rising value of the powdered horn – now at up to £50,000 a kilogram – thanks to growing affluence in China, where the substance is falsely claimed to cure everything from cancer to hangovers.

Thieves have previously targeted rhino heads at the Haslemere Educational Museum, Surrey, and Norwich Castle Museum, as well as at museums across Europe.

In Africa, entire herds have been 
slaughtered simply so their horns can be hacked off. A record 668 rhinos
were killed for their horns in 2012 in South Africa, up almost 50 per 
cent on the number for 2011.

The majority of the animals were killed in the Kruger national park, the country’s biggest wildlife reserve.

Damian Aspinall of the Kent zoos said: ‘It is tragic and beyond belief that, as we do everything possible to restore these magnificent animals safely to the wild, the human traders who seek to profit from their slaughter should bring their vile activities to the UK.

‘In the light of what Kent police have told us is a genuine threat, we will do everything to protect our herds. Our volunteers will be recruited responsibly after careful vetting.

Their presence will enable us to be vigilant and alert at every point at which the rhino could possibly come under threat.

‘We would also ask that visitors to Howletts and Port Lympne report any suspicious behaviour to staff and volunteers.’

Targeted: Kent Police warned the zoos this week that their black rhino population is under threat

The Aspinall Foundation, which claims to be the UK’s leading wildlife conservation charity, made its appeal for volunteers to help guard its herds of black rhino after receiving a warning from the Kent police animal specialist on Wednesday.

Its rhinos are kept initially amid hundreds of acres of Kent countryside, but are also involved in a ‘Back To The Wild’ programme which aims to send captive-bred animals from endangered species to their natural habitats.

Nine months ago three black rhinos from Port Lympne were returned safely to Tanzania where they continue to flourish.
