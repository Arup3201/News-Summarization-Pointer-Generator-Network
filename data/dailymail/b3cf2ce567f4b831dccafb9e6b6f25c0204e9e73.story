Screen stars from a bygone era always looked incredibly groomed and glamorous.

But, as a recently unearthed 1937 video shows, set hair, a smooth complexion and a full face of perfect make-up took a lot of work.

Hollywood actress Constance Bennett, 33, presents the five-minute clip which documents her time-consuming morning routine, which includes luxurious bubble bath, four creams, a face mask - and the help of a ladies' maid.

1937 video Daily Beauty Rituals, presented by Constance Bennett, was released by Turner Classic Movies

She invites viewers into her home and narrates each lavish stage of her regime.

She rises at 7.30 - woken by her maid - and slips into a silk robe. She already appears to be in full make-up, with perfectly set hair.

The actress and mother to a young son begins with a cleansing cream.

She then applies a stimulating cream to her 'clean base' and leaves the potion on for a few minutes 'to start the stimulation process'.

Constance says that this is 
key when applying creams to the face, in the same way that a toothbrush 
stimulates gums and hairbrush strengthens hair.

She then applies a complexion mask for 'deep circulation', which she says one must leave on while in the bath - or while making breakfast, for those who bathed the night before.

The following step in her lengthy 
ritual is application of a 'glow base'. Next comes cream rouge, then powder for a mattifying effect - but she only applies a little as 
she 'likes a sheen'.

The final touch is lipstick.Â

She says: 'Using a lipstick that stays on one's lips rather than what those lips touch is important.'

In the video, Constance's maid is on call to wake her, run her bath and constantly remind her of the time.

Constance pictured a short while after the video, with her then-new husband Gilbert Roland, in 1941

Finally, she says: 'Remember, that to be beautiful and natural is the natural birthright of every woman.'

The 1937 short film marks a change in the actress's career. Within a few years she was making fewer films and later started businesses marketing 
womenswear and cosmetics.

Still youthful, Constance died suddenly at the age of 60, shortly after finishing her 57th film.
