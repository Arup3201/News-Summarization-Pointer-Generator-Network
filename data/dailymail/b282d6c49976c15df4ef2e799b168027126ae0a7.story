Precocious: Nevek, an 18-month-old Canadian toddler was recently caught on camera shredding the slopes in Quebec with his proud papa and three-year-old sister, Abigail

He can't yet talk but this toddler has become a sensation on the slopes after learning to snowboard at just 18-months-old .

Nevek, from Quebec, Canada, is caught on camera dressed in a snow suit, goggles and helmet - but unlike most snowboarders of his talent he's also clutching a pacifier.

This week, The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation caught up with Nevek - and his proud parents - as they snowboarded near Montreal.

Nevek - in the initial year of what promises to be a long and illustrious snowboarding career - was found shredding along with his father, mum, and three-year-old sister, Abygaelle, a relative veteran in her second winter on the slopes. 

His father, Keven Rancourt, decided to teach the toddler how to shred snow so that he could join in on the family’s winter adventures.“Because I’m going every week on different hills…I want to bring him and his sister everywhere I go.”

Family fun: Dad says he decided to teach his two tots snowboarding skills because he hits the slopes every week and wanted to include his kids in the activity

He's not alone!: Nevek is far from the only toddler honing his skills on the slopes at a tender age. Youtube is filled with clips of precocious tykes, like this one, who are wasting no time

Out of the way!: Ashton was reportedly 22 months old when a video depicting his snowboarding hijinks were uploaded to the Internet in April, 2011

'Because I'm going every week on a different hill, I want to bring him and his sister every where I go,' Nevek's father told The CBC.

'I think it's amazing,' an obviously impressed woman who was watching Nevek told The CBC. 'I think it's the cutest thing I've ever seen. With the pacifer, it's, like, unbelievable.'

For her part, Nevek's sister, Abygaelle, is in her second year on the slopes. 'She's always asking me when we are going snowboarding,' said dad, who added with a chuckle of whether Abygaelle has yet lent her brother any snowboarding advice: 'Well, she's not good enough yet.'

As he spoke to The CBC, papa, held a clearly fussy Nevek, who might have had enough for that day. 

Burton babies!: This 14-month-old apparently has Nevek beat for precociousness on the slopes. Her papa uploaded a heartwarming video in May of her first winter on a board

Caroline, meanwhile, is shown boarding down Mt. Snow in Vermont at three years old. She notably uses the same brand snowboard - a Burton - as Nevek
