The Obama administration will work to ensure that gay and lesbian Americans are eligible to take leave from their jobs to care for a same-sex spouse, regardless of whether they live in a state that recognizes gay marriage, the White House said Friday.

President Barack Obama is directing the Labor Department to start drafting rules making clear that the Family and Medical Leave Act applies to same-sex couples, allowing gay and lesbian employees to take unpaid leave to care for a sick spouse regardless of where they live.

Currently,
 legally married couples are eligible for those benefits if they reside 
in a state in which same-sex marriage is legal.

Obama is directing the 
Department of Labor to propose a rule extending the FMLA rights even to 
states where gay unions are not legal.

The
 move comes three years after the Obama administration stopped defending
 the Defense of Marriage Act, which lets states refuse to recognize gay 
marriages performed in other states.

The
 rule is being issued as Attorney General Eric Holder announces the 
results of a review of U.S. laws in the wake of the landmark 2013 
Supreme Court Windsor decision that held that the survivor of a same-sex
 couple could claim the federal estate tax exemption for surviving 
spouses.

The decision forced 
the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages in states where 
it is legal and has paved the way for the Obama administration to take 
steps to expand the legal rights of gay couples.

The Family and Medical Leave Act allows employees to take unpaid, job-protected leave for family and medical purposes.

Holder
 is due to issue a review on Friday of how the more than 1,000 different
 federal rights and obligations linked to a marriage or a spouse are 
affected by the Windsor decision.

Obama
 on Tuesday said he would sign an executive order barring federal 
contractors from discriminating against employees based on their sexual 
orientation, but he also told gay rights activists they need to keep up 
the pressure on Congress to pass a broader law.

In
 February, Holder announced widespread changes within the Justice 
Department to benefit same-sex married couples, such as recognizing a 
legal right for them not to testify against each other in civil and 
criminal cases.

The White House is promoting the move as 
part of Obama's push to expand protections for gays and lesbians by 
allowing same-sex couples to take advantage of the same federal benefits
 available to married heterosexual couples.

To that end, the Justice Department also plans to announce it has completed a review that Obama ordered to assess what legal benefits can be extended to gay couples.

Already, Obama has moved to ensure gay couples have equal access to health insurance, immigration privileges and tax benefits, the White House said.

But the White House said there are a few benefits that current law prohibits the federal government from granting to same-sex couples.

Hoping to end that limitation, the Obama administration is calling on Congress to pass legislation removing those prohibitions.

Democratic members of Congress already have introduced bills expanding protections for gays and lesbians related to Social Security and veterans' benefits, the White House said.

Current law only allows couples living in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage to be eligible for benefits
