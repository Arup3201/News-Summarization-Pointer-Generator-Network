A bus ploughed into a florist's shop after the driver jumped off to buy a newspaper.

The single-decker slammed through a set of traffic lights before crashing into the front of Edelweiss flower store in Stowmarket, Suffolk.

There was one stunned passenger on board the number 88 Ipswich-bound First Eastern Counties bus as it careered down a hill, gathering speed.

Smash: The 12-tonne bus was left with a smashed windscreen and no bumper after hurtling into a florists

The driver had parked the bus and stepped off to go into a newsagents at 8am on Wednesday morning.

But moments later, the 12-tonne vehicle began to move until it was plummeting down a steep slope.

It slammed into the corner shop, hitting the wooden-panelled front clean off the building, and smashing the vehicle's windscreen.

Chris Speed, business manager for the Norwich-based company, said the driver had turned off the engine before he went to get his morning paper.

Mr Speed said: 'Unfortunately the vehicle moved forward, went through the lights and ended up in the shop.'

He said the coach would be tested in case it had a mechanical fault.

Mr Speed said the driver, who has not been named, had worked for the firm for a 'good few years' and had stopped to buy a newspaper.

'He was only a few metres away from the bus,' he said.

Isabel Wilton, who owns Edelweiss, said nobody was in the shop at the time of the bizarre incident.

Chris Speed, business manager for First Eastern Counties buses, said an investigation has been launched into the crash

But she said customers could not actually enter the store as the careering bus had damaged her premises.

Mrs Wilton is now working from the Noble and White gift shop across the road while the damage is repaired.

She said: 'The shock of it did all set in but the most important thing was that nobody was hurt and that is all that matters at the end of the day.

'It could have been so serious.'

Suffolk Police said they had launched an investigation into the crash.
