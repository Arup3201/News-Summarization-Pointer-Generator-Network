Franck Ribery will not back down on his retirement from the France national team.

The 31-year-old Bayern Munich winger missed this summer's World Cup with a back problem and called time on his international career once the tournament was over.

UEFA president Michel Platini, himself a former France international and coach, warned last week that Ribery could be suspended from playing for his club if he rejected an attempt from national coach Didier Deschamps to persuade him to return.

Michel Platini said it is up to Didier Deschamps whether or not Franck Ribery plays for France

But Ribery told German newspaper Die Welt: 'I took this decision in consultation with Didier Deschamps.

'I want to concentrate on my club and I will not change my opinion.'

Platini had warned that Ribery would be in breach of FIFA regulations should he reject a call-up, perhaps recalling the situation in 2006 when Claude Makelele was summoned by then-France coach Raymond Domenech, despite having announced his international retirement.

Michel Platani claimed he could suspend Franck Ribery if he refused to play for the national side

'Franck cannot decide himself whether he plays for France,' said Platini in quotes reported by another German newspaper, Bild.

'If Didier Deschamps picks him, he must come. That's the FIFA rule. If he doesn't come, he will be suspended for three Bayern Munich games.'

Ribery shrugged off any concerns, insisting: 'I do not concern myself with the politics or what is being said.'

And Bayern's executive chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge added: 'He has not even been all up. All is in order and FIFA compliant.'

Franck Ribery says he will not back down over the issue no matter what Michel Platini says
