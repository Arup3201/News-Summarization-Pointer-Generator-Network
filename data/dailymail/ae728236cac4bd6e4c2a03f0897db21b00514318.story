The daughters of a British woman beheaded in Tenerife have met the killer's family in North Wales.

Samantha and Sarah Mills-Westley want to discover more about the man who killed their 60-year-old mother Jennifer in their quest for an independent review into how he remained free to murder.

In February homeless Bulgarian-born drug addict Deyan Deyanov, 29, was sentenced to 20 years in a secure psychiatric unit on the holiday island after slaying Ms Mills-Westley.

Deyanov, who had been sectioned in 
North Wales in 2010 under the Mental Health Act, attacked the victim 
while she was shopping in the popular resort of Los Cristianos in the 
Canary Islands, on May 13, 2011.

Tragic end: Grandmother Jennifer Mills-Westley, 60, was beheaded while shopping in Tenerife

The
 delusional drifter was living rough in a derelict building on 
Tenerife's Los Cristianos beach, used crack cocaine and LSD and had 
built a shrine full of religious imagery.

His history of violence can be traced back to his hometown of Ruse, a city in northern Bulgaria known as the Little Vienna.

After
 leaving Bulgaria, he drifted all over Europe, staying in Edinburgh and 
North Wales, where he was sectioned but he was released from care in 
October 2010 and travelled to Tenerife.

He believed he was Jesus Christ and on earth to create a new Jerusalem and heard voices commanding him to kill.

Well-known as a troublemaker to police and social services on the island, he had been arrested at least four times between January and May 2011.

In January 2011, he committed a series of random violent attacks and was committed to La Candelaria hospital's psychiatric unit, but was released on bail in early February.

Days before he killed Ms Mills-Westley an arrest warrant was issued for him.

After his conviction, the victim's two daughters Samantha, 39, and Sarah, 43, hit out at the authorities for their handling of Deyanov.

Tonight, in a Channel 4 Dispatches programme, the sisters, who are calling for an independent review, meet the killer's aunt in North Wales to ask if he received the right care.

Samantha says: 'When he first got admitted, he was relatively well behaved, even though he was showing signs of having schizophrenic episodes, of talking to people who didn't exist. Telling his aunty that he was God.

'After the brutality of that attack 
against my mother [Deyanov] still has more rights than I do as a victim... That cannot be right.'

'The second time he was admitted, she said that his behaviour had really becoming incredibly erratic. That he was becoming violent.'

Her sister Sarah tells the programme: 'It appears that Deyanov left the hospital without a treatment plan and that the family had no idea that a) he had been released or that b) there was a mechanism of support that should have been released with him.

'It was really up to him to sort himself out.'

She adds: 'We still haven't got justice for our mum, and what's really important for us now as a family is an independent review.'

The family know the Health Board in North Wales conducted an internal inquiry into Deyanov's care but they were refused access to it.

Instead, the sisters were told by letter that: 'lessons have been learnt' yet the board will not say what those lessons are - because of patient confidentiality.

Sarah says: 'I now have to sit and write a letter to the man who beheaded my mother asking him for his permission to have access to his medical records.

'Bearing in mind I saw him in court, he is clearly delusional, he's still hearing voices he's a very sick man.

'And after the brutality of that attack 
against my mother he still has more rights than I do as a victim, and 
the rest of our family. That cannot be right.'

Drifter: Bulgarian Deyan Deyanov was convicted of decapitating Ms Mills-Westley and sentenced to 20 years in a psychiatric unit

The Health Board in Wales told Channel 4 Dispatches: 'The Health Board is naturally deeply sympathetic to the predicament of the family of the deceased and fully understands their desire to seek answers.

'Our detailed investigations into the treatment provided to Mr Deyanov are continuing and it would be premature to offer comment at this stage.

'Any response we are able to provide is, in any event, likely to be limited due to confidentiality restrictions imposed on us under the Data Protection Act.

'However, we can state categorically that the decision to discharge Mr Deyanov was in no way influenced by issues of funding or shortages of beds.'

The programmes airs at 8pm tonight.
