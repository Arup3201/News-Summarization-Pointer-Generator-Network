They're always said to be man's best friend, and judging by this Spaniel's reaction to seeing her master, the old adage still rings true.

Jezebel the excited Spaniel couldn't wait to see owner Steve Morris after the Flight Lieutenant returned from his mission in the skies over Libya.

Flight Lieutenant Morris was one of nine Squadron GR4 Tornados to return to RAF Marham, Norfolk, following a seven-month deployment supporting the rebels who overthrew Colonel Gaddafi.

There were touching scenes too as Wing Commander Andy Turk, who navigated Tornado GR4  warplanes on missions against Colonel Gaddafi’s forces, lifted his three-year-old son above his head as they were reunited at the Norfolk airbase after the seven-month deployment.

During the heartwarming scene another of his young children looked on proudly, dressed in a miniature RAF uniform.

Wing Commander Turk flew scores of missions during the Libyan conflict, regularly dealing crushing blows to the dictator’s troops as they threatened to slaughter civilians.

Yesterday, as he returned to wife Abi and his children, he said: 'It is fantastic to be back with the family and the little ones but more importantly it's fantastic to bring the squadron back.

'They did an amazing job over the skies of Libya as part of the wider RAF efforts.

'It has been inspirational to see the momentous events over the last month.

'Because there were no British troops, it was very important that the RAF maintained our intelligence and surveillance.

'We got a real sense of connection to what was going on on the ground.

'We
 feel a real sense of achievement and it shows the flexibility of the 
equipment we have in service to take these sorts of conflict head on.'

Based at Gioia del Colle in Southern 
Italy, the British pilots played a key role in the 3,000 UK sorties, in 
Libya, more than 2,100 of which were strike attacks on around 640 
targets.

The final seven GR4 Tornados landed at Marham this morning after the first nine arrived home on Friday.

The
 Tornado force, deployed under Operation Ellamy as part of the Nato 
operation, was led by Marham-based IX Squadron with additional aircrew 
and engineers from Lossiemouth.

They
 were deployed with Apache attack helicopters, airborne warning and 
control systems aircraft, VC10 refuellers and airborne radar aircraft.

The Tornados' role over Libya was reconnaissance and surveillance as well as air strikes.

Although the RAF does not comment on specific sorties, one of the most used weapons was the Brimstone missile.

The Brimstone has a hit rate of more 
than 90 per cent and its precision allows the use of a small warhead with a low 
risk of collateral damage.

Marham
 station commander, Group Captain Pete 'Rocky' Rochelle, said: 'This 
operation has shown the versatility of the Tornado aircraft.

'While IX Squadron were deployed over Libya, 31 Squadron were fighting in a very different conflict in Afghanistan.'
