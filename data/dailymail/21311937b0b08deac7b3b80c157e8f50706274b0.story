Health officials are working to stem panic over the number of patients being tested for Ebola after reports put the number as high as six.

Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan reported that one man was being tested for the deadly disease after arriving at the hospital early on Monday  with ‘a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms'. His test results are expected today or Wednesday.

On Tuesday, CNN and The New York Post reported that six people were being tested for Ebola in New York City. Mount Sinai confirmed today that this was not the case.

A statement today from Mount Sinai read: 'Contrary to a recent report in the New York Post, there is only one patient currently at Mount Sinai being tested for the Ebola Virus Disease.

'The patient, who remains in isolation, was stable overnight and in good spirits. No other patients have presented with similar symptoms and travel history to West Africa.' 

Mount Sinai’s Chief Medical Officer Jeremy Boal said on Monday night that it was 'very unlikely' that the patient was suffering from Ebola.

Officials are working to assuage fears over Ebola which has no known cure and is fatal in about 90 per cent of patients.

It also emerged on Tuesday that a 46-year-old woman had been tested for the disease in Columbus, Ohio but the results were negative. She had gone to hospital after returning from a trip to West Africa.

Another patient was isolated at a hospital in New York City last week after arriving on a flight from West Africa and showing symptoms found in Ebola patients.

That man was screened at Kennedy International Airport last Wednesday and taken to Bellevue Hospital. He had a fever but within a day the fever had gone and it became clear he did not have Ebola. 

'We are on a heightened state of alert,' said Ian Michaels, a spokesman for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. 'We have instructed all 11 of our hospitals to follow C.D.C. guidelines and be on the lookout for Ebola-like symptoms.'

On a live report from Atlanta where two confirmed cases of Ebola are now being treated, CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr Sanjay Gupta said on Tuesday: 'There have been about a half a dozen patients who have had their blood tested because of concern, those particular patients their stories were not made public.

'I’m not sure if that’s because of heightened concern by the hospital or what that means exactly.'

Two American aid workers who contracted Ebola in Liberia are currently being cared for at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia in a specially-sealed unit.

The second patient, Nancy Writebol, was stretchered out of an ambulance today by medics in biohazard suits.

The 59-year-old missionary from North Carolina arrived in a specially-converted ambulance at 1pm on Tuesday after landing on a chartered jet from Liberia.

Mrs Writebol will be treated along with fellow missionary Dr Kent Brantly, 33, in a special quarantine wing at the hospital. 

She is reportedly weak but showing signs of improvement. Dr Brantly is also reportedly showing signs of improvement. 

Both aid workers are receiving an experimental drug so novel that it has never been tested for safety in humans.

There are fears in other parts of the world as more cases of Ebola are reported. Saudi Arabian health officials are testing a patient suspected of contracting the disease, Nigerian officials said eight people have symptoms and one patient has been reportedly quarantined in the UK. 

The Ebola death toll has reached 887, with more than 1,600 confirmed cases in what is the worst outbreak ever recorded.
