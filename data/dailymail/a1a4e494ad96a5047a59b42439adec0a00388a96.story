One of Disney’s most annoying songs has to be ‘It’s a small world,’ but the addictive ditty might just have a point.

From the Lion King in the Serengeti to the Aristocrats in Paris, one artist has created a map of the world revealing the location of all of Disney’s animated films.

Eowyn Smith’s fun map shows the location of the magical kingdoms and whimsical locations from a total of 58 Disney films.

These are the five locations that could not be mapped.

Dinosaur – set on the Pangaea when the map of the Earth looked very different

Treasure Planet – an alternate universe

Wreck it Ralph – cyberspace

Monsters Inc – an alternate universe

Wall-E – future Earth and out of space

Ms Smith describes herself as a’ humble and devoted fan’ of Disney films and when the location was not made clear in a movie, she researched the original tale of myth in order to pinpoint its location on her colourful map.

The map has generated debate on Deviant Art, where it was first published, as to where films should be located –such as The Little Mermaid in the Caribbean – and why Disney has never set a film in Russia.

By way of an explanation for the position of Arial’s underwater world, Ms Smith wrote: ‘Although the author and original story are Danish, the wildlife is clearly tropical. There is simply no way to have that type of flora and fauna anywhere near Denmark.

‘It is very reasonable that The Little Mermaid movie could take place on the Danish colony, now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands. Another big clue is the fact that in the beginning of the movie the storm is referred to as a "Hurricane." Something Europeans knew very little about.’

There are 20 films set in the U.S. 
according to the map, including Lady and the Tramp in New England (pictured left) A

There are 20 films set in the U.S. according to the map, including Lady and the Tramp in New England, A Bug’s Life in Texas, The Rescuers in New Orleans, Bolt in Hollywood and Toy Story in a small Ohio town.

‘The idea here was to place the Toy Story movies near Chagrin Fall, Ohio which is the popular theory for where they are located,’ Ms Smith said.

Little Mermaid: CaribbeanAlthough the author and original story are Danish, the wildlife is clearly tropical. There is simply no way to have that type of flora and fauna anywhere near Denmark. It is very reasonable that The Little Mermaid movie could take place on the Danish colony, now known as the US  Virgin Islands.

Brother Bear: Northern Canada, AlaskaThe people in the movie are cast as Inuits, who inhabit both northern Canada and Alaska.

Meet the Robinsons: US/Canada.Lewis mentions being from Canada but the tone of the family seems like they are American.

Bambi: Northern US/CanadaThough originally a German story, the collection of animals clearly indicates North American wildlife. [from the bambi wiki] "Disney took the liberty of changing Bambi's species into a white-tailed deer from his original species of roe deer, since roe deer do not inhabit the United States, and the white-tailed deer is more familiar to Americans.""

Fox and the Hound:Northern US/CanadaAlthough the feel of the movie definitely seems Appalachian, there are simply no Grizzly Bears in Appalachia, which would put the movie more north.

‘It is based on the idea that it is the home town of Lee Unkrich (co-director of several Toy Story movies) and there is a Go Tigers sticker in Andy's room - the mascot for Unkrich's high school. The weather is also consistent with Ohio in that they get a heavy blanket of snow at/around Christmas,’ she added.

There are just three films set in South America, including Pixar’s heart-breaking Up and three in the whole of Asia – The Jungle Book, which is set in India, Mulan in China, and Aladdin in Saudi Arabia.

Tarzan and The Lion King are the only films set in Africa, while Australia is only the location of two fims – Finding Nemo and The Rescuers Down Under.

Europe is the setting for the most films – 23 in total – and the UK is the most popular location.

Films set in the UK include: Robin Hood, the Sword and the Stone, Winnie the Pooh – which was set in Ashdown Forrest – Alice in Wonderland, 101 Dalmatians and Peter Pan. The Black Cauldron was based on a Welsh myth, while Brave was set in Scotland.

Elsewhere, Snow White and Tangled were set in Germany, Hercules in Greece and Pinocchio in Italy.

France has been featured numerous times in Disney films, including the iconic Cinderella, the Aristocrats and Beauty and the Beast. Sleeping Beauty has also be placed in the country as it is based on the Charles Perrault version of this story and the French national anthem is played to announce the arrival of Princess Aurora.

However, there are five films that could not be located, Mashable reported. Dinosaur has been omitted as the Earth looked like a very different place and its location would be the Pangaea.

Treasure planet was set in an alternate universe, Wreck It Ralph and Monsters Inc in cyberspace and Wall-E on future Earth and wider space.
