Politics has quite literally gone to the dogs in one Minnesota village, where a seven-year-old pup has been named mayor.

Duke, a Great Pyrenees, won the mayoral election in Cormorant this weekend by a landslide, taking all but two or three votes.

The dog, who is often seen eating hamburgers and chips in the village's pub, will be officially sworn in on Saturday.

Sworn in: Duke, a Great Pyrenees, won the  election in Cormorant, Minnesota, this weekend by a landslide

New village mayor: Duke, who is seven years old, was treated to five hours of grooming after his victory

All 12 Cormorant villagers paid $1 to vote in the election, with at least nine voting for Duke. 

Duke won the ceremonial role after a tightly fought campaign against local store owner Richard Sherbrook.

Mr Sherbrook, who voted for Duke himself, said: 'I'm going to back the dog 100 per cent. He's a sportsman and he likes to hunt. He'll really protect the town.

'There's no question that he'll do a good job representing the community.'

Duke was treated to five hours of grooming after his victory and will receive a salary of a year's supply of free dog food from Tuffy's Pet Food store in the nearby village of Perham.

A video of Duke shows him wearing a mayoral hat, but it is not clear if he will have to wear it for all official business.

Villagers say Duke, who is yet to make an inaugural address, has already started making changes in Cormorant.

David Rick, who voted for the dog, said: 'What he does is when the cars are coming through town, they're hitting town at 50mph, and he slows them down. He follows me wherever I go.'

Tricia Maloney also voted for Duke and said: 'He doesn't know how to handle this publicity. He won by a landslide. He's used to coming to the pub and getting some burgers and some fries or something.'

Pigasus for President: A 145lb hog called Pigasus was nominated as a Presidential candidate in 1968. Just as a man was reading a nomination speech on behalf of the hog, it and seven conspirators were arrested. 

Vote goat: The McGillicuddy Serious Party entered a goat in the Waiheke Island election. A hedgehog also tried to run as an MP for the party but was unsuccessful in being nominated. 

Democratic dog: Bosco, a Labrador-Rottweiler mix, served 13 years as the mayor of Sunol, California. He was invited to speak in front of the Chinese consulate after the Tianamen Square protests in 1989, and was dubbed the face of freedom and democracy.

Cat got your vote: Hank the cat was entered as a joke candidate for the 2012 Senate election in Virginia, but came third with 7,300 votes. 

Monkey business: Tiao, a monkey, got 400,000 votes in his attempt to become mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1988. Sadly votes for him did not count, but he would have come an honorable third.
