South Australians check your ticket, you could be $15 million richer and not even know it!

The winner did not receive a wake up call this morning to inform them of the happy news as the purchase was not registered through South Australia Lotteries' Easiplay Club.

If your ticket is not registered with Easiplay Club they are unable to inform you of your win.

The winning numbers are 4,26,3,12,2,17 and 32.

The Oz Lotto $15 million jackpot is reporetedly the largest lotto prize that has been won in South Australia this year to date.

The previous largest amount won in SA this year was a $5 million Oz Lotto prize won in Dry Creek on 10 June 2014 which was claimed by a Yorke Peninsula man who had recently survived a heart attack.

'We're hoping the unregistered winner checks their ticket and comes forward to claim their $15 million prize as soon as possible,' Zoe Knoble from Tatts Lotteries told Daily Mail Australia.

$15 million has been won by someone in South Australia. It has gone unclaimed from Wednesday's Oz Lotto draw

Meanwhile, a $583,868.36 X Lotto bounty won with an entry purchased from the Mount Barker Hotel remains unclaimed in South Australia, more than four months after the draw.

The prize was won in the April 5 draw with winning numbers 24, 29, 22, 39, 36 and 1 and the supplementary numbers 45 and 6.

All Lotto players who purchased tickets in Mount Barker are urged to check their tickets.

The jackpot won on Wednesday is the largest that has gone off in South Australia

While in Queensland a whopper $35 million prize went unclaimed for days.

The Sunshine Coast woman won $35.9m after buying a first 
division Powerball ticket.

'I’m just waiting to wake up from this dream!” the stunned winner exclaimed,' she told Golden Casket.'I honestly never thought I’d win in last night’s $70 million Powerball draw. I think the most I’ve ever won in lotto is about $20 so this is unbelievable.'I can actually retire, I’ve wanted to retire for some time now.'
