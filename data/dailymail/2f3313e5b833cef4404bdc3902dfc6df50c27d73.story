Once again Pope Francis showcased his lively sense of humour when he stopped to try on a firefighter's helmet in front of a Vatican crowd.

The 76-year-old was in the popemobile on his way to lead his weekly general audience when a group of Italian voluntary firefighters caught his attention this morning.

One of his assistants then handed him the black and yellow helmet as the firefighters cheered in St Peter's Square.

The smiling Pontiff gestured and asked the group 'shall I wear it?'

And after being told yes, he put the protective helmet on with a smile, drawing in applause from the volunteer firefighters.

He then took it off and handed it back to the firefighters while shaking their hands.

They also gave the Pope a frame with the symbol of the firefighters corps - a flame with two bells on the sides.

The Pope also unintentionally wore another form of headwear when a blue scarf was thrown from an enthusiastic pilgrim in the crowd and landed on his head.

Every
Wednesday, Pope Francis has made it a habit of touring for 
approximately 30 minutes among the thousands of pilgrims who come to 
attend the weekly audience and to see him in St Peter's Square, blessing
and shaking hands with the most varied groups of people, and often 
receiving gifts.

Making a habit of it: Pope Francis wears a hard hat he was given by a worker on his during a visit to Sardinia last month

According to the Prefect office of the Pontifical House, there were some 70,000 pilgrims taking part in the audience.

It is not the first time the Pope has donned a hard hat.

Only last month he wore one as he visited a mine in one of Italy's poorest 
regions to offer hope to the unemployed and entrepreneurs struggling to 
hang on.

The yellow helmet 
was emblazoned with the 'Welcome to Sardinia, Holiness'.

Earlier this week the Pope surprised onlookers when it became apparent he had a rosary bead dangling from his ear.

A pilgrim had thrown the rosary beads at Francis, as he circled the crowds in his Popemobile at the end of a mass in Rome’s St Peter’s square.

The Pope’s security riding alongside him were seemingly oblivious to the arrival of the unexpected present.

He looked momentarily startled as he felt something hanging next to his cheek.

But when he saw the beads, he chuckled before putting them in his pocket.

Last June he had caught a rosary thrown by the faithful to the amusement of the crowd who applauded.
