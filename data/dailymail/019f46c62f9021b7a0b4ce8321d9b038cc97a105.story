Ukip wants Ed Miliband in power because voters are more likely to opt to stay in the EU if a referendum takes place under David Cameron, senior party figures admit.

Two Ukip sources have conceded privately that they would prefer Labour to win the next election, since they believe that would maximise the chances of Britain exiting the European Union.

The prospect of people voting out would be increased under an unpopular, pro-EU Labour prime minister who has shown little interest in reform of Britain’s relationship with Brussels, one said.

Another Ukip source, asked if the party would prefer a referendum to take place under Mr Miliband, said: ‘Of course we would.’

Ukip has made strenuous efforts in recent months to claim that it now poses an equal threat to Labour and Conservative prospects at next year’s general election.

Pollsters agree, however, that a Ukip surge is likely to hand Labour victory over the Conservatives in a string of marginal seats and increase the chances of Mr Miliband entering Downing Street.

Mr Cameron has promised to hold an in/out referendum on Britain’s place in the EU, but made it clear he aims to renegotiate a looser relationship with Brussels and wants the UK to stay in if reform can be achieved.

Eurosceptics fear a repeat of the Scottish independence referendum, in which an offer of a transfer of powers to Edinburgh, a campaign by the three main Westminster parties and warnings from business leaders about the dangers of breaking away combined to deliver a vote for the status quo.

Mr Miliband has effectively ruled out holding an EU referendum, but Ukip believes he will either be forced to concede one if he becomes prime minister or face a popular uprising that would see its support increase further.

One Conservative Cabinet minister said: ‘Those people in Ukip who want to get Britain out of the EU above all else pretend they want a referendum, but actually they will do anything it can to stop one happening after renegotiation under David Cameron.’

Ukip leader Nigel Farage suggested over the weekend that if his party gains enough MPs to hold the balance of power in next May’s general election, it would demand a vote on EU membership by the end of July – before any renegotiation of powers could take place.

He said his price to prop up a government led by another party would be ‘a full free and fair referendum on our continued membership of the European Union’.

‘I don't see any reason why that referendum could not take place before the August break,’ he said.

Many in Ukip want Ed Miliband to be Prime Minister - because people would be more likely to leave the EU

Yesterday it emerged that the second byelection triggered by a Tory MP defecting to Ukip will be held on November 20.

Following the defection of Mark Reckless, the Conservatives are to select one of two shortlisted women candidates in a postal ballot open to all residents in Rochester and Strood, Kent.

They are Kelly Tolhurst, a marine surveyor and daughter of a boat builder; and Anna Firth, a former barrister. Both women are local councillors.

The Tories appear to be hoping to capitalise on Ukip’s significant ‘women problem’ by opting for a female candidate. Polls in Heywood and Middleton, the Manchester seat where Ukip ran Labour close in a byelection last week, suggested that the Eurosceptic party had a narrow lead among male voters but nearly 40 points behind among women.

Mr Cameron, who is expected to campaign in the seat later this week, said yesterday the postal ballot would put residents in the constituency ‘in the driver’s seat’.

‘Nigel Farage and Mark Reckless want to turn this election into a national media circus – we want it to be about you and what you want for the future of this area,’ he said in a letter to local voters.

‘The decision is in your hands. There’s no stunts or backroom deals, just a strong local candidate you can trust.’

Earlier, Mr Cameron admitted that Ukip is ‘seductive’ to voters who have seen living standards squeezed.

‘We've had a very tough time in Britain. People haven't seen pay rises or living standard rises, often for year after year, you've got Europe looking like the source of our problems rather than the source of opportunity, immigration has been too high, there's been a coalition which not everyone has liked,’ he told ITV’s The Agenda.

The Prime Minister said the ‘simple answers’ being offered by Mr Farage had ‘become quite seductive’, but warned voting for the party in the general election would mean Mr Miliband gaining power.

Last night, Mr Cameron told a private meeting of Conservative MPs they had been ‘lied to’ repeatedly by Mr Reckless, who denied he was planning to defect to Ukip.

He ordered an extraordinary effort to try to hold onto the seat in the byelection next month – telling Cabinet ministers they would be expected to campaign there at least five times before polling day, with backbench MPs told to go at least three times.

Mr Cameron also repeated his commitment to demanding reforms of EU freedom of movement rules as part of his planned renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with Brussels.
