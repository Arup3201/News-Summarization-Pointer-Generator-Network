Princess Diana stayed there twice, it's a favourite with the New York Fashion Week set and every American president since Truman has visited the decadent tower building.

New York's The Carlyle has been welcoming the world's power players for decades, including John.F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie and reams of kings and queens from Denmark, Greece, Spain and Sweden.

Now the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are set to add their names to the hotel's prestigious visitor book, reportedly staying at the classically elegant venue for their three-day trip to the US next weekend.

Upcoming trip: Kate and Will have reportedly planned to stay at The Carlyle in Manhattan's Upper East Side

Royal retreat: Every American president since Truman and many kings and queens have visited the hotel

From Sunday December 7 to Tuesday December 9 the royal duo have reportedly checked in to the hotel  in the heart of the Manhattan's Upper East Side on Madison Avenue.

But rather than presidents and head-of-states, the young couple may have taken their cue to book from rather closer to home, as both Prince William's father and late mother, Diana, have also visited The Carlyle.

Princess Diana stayed there in December 1995 when she visited New York for the United Cerebral Palsy’s annual dinner and Prince Charles and Camilla also used the hotel when they stayed in the city  in 2005.

Landmark: View of 5th Avenue and the hotel's infamous tower from Central Park, New York

It's a wise choice, with fine architectural and a colourful history. Designed by the noted architectural firm Bien & Prince and named in honour of British essayist Thomas Carlyle, the hotel has been a landmark for decades.

The 35-storey building, completed in 1930, describes itself as 'a timeless classic' with 188 rooms and suites and sweeping views of Central Park and New York.

'This New York luxury hotel showcases refined taste and creates a true Manhattan experience for sophisticated travellers' says the website.

Sweeping views: Rates range from $675 (£431) for a Superior Room to $15,000 (£9,580) for a Empire Suite

As you might expect, the prices are not exactly rock bottom. They range from $675 (£431) per night for two people in a modest Superior Room with 400sq. ft. of space and either a king or two twin beds, to $15,000 (£9,580) per night for a stay in the Empire Suite, a spacious three-bedroom duplex with 2,600 sq. ft. of living space and a private art collection.

While The Mirror reports the Empire Suite is not yet booked out during the royal stay, there's no doubt the young couple will have a more than comfortable time.

All rooms come with Kiehl’s toiletries, bathrobes and 24 hour room service. Recent reviews describe 'elegant white blooms in Art Deco mirrored pots on antique mahogany tables' and 'doormen [who] doff their caps at you as you enter the building'.

The hotel's Bemel­mans Bar  attracts art fans keen to see work by Ludwig Bemel­mans, author of the Madeline chil­dren's books - the only commission of his work open to the public anywhere in the world. 

Starry: Other well known guests of the hotel include Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman and Victoria Beckham

Starry guests flock there and regulars include Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Victoria Beckham and Leonardo DiCaprio.

As Kate is four months pregnant it's  likely she'll need some down time during the royal visit. Luckily, the Carlyle's spa is more than qualified to cope. They offer massages ($260/£165 for 90 minutes), facials (up to $375/£240), body scrubs, wraps, hammam treatments and waxing.

The hotel is also famous for jazz. Every Monday night paying guests (tickets cost from $135/£86) can watch Woody Allen play the clarinet live in the Cafe Carlyle with the the Eddy Davis New Orleans jazz band. The royal visit spans a Monday so who knows, they might be in the mood for a little ragtime rhythm.

During their three day stay the Duke and Duchess are leaving 16-month-old Prince George behind as they attend a schedule including a black-tie do, an NBA basketball game and trips to see inner-city youth projects.

The trip is expected to be Kate’s last overseas visit until she gives birth to the couple’s second child in April.

However, William is expected to carry out a solo visit to China early next year to strengthen Britain’s relationship with the country.

A royal spokesman declined to comment this morning on where the Duke and Duchess are staying in New York.
