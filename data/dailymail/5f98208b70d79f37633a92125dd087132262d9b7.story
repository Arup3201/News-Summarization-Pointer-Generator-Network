An Ohio mother says her 13-year-old stabbed her multiple times to please Slender Man - the same fictional horror character that allegedly inspired a grisly knife attack in Wisconsin last week.

The resident of Hamilton County, who has not been publicly named, told the station WLWT that her daughter was obsessed with the ghoulish Internet boogyman.

According to the parent, the 13-year-old girl has been suffering from longstanding mental problems, but she never imagined the child would try to harm her.

Deeply disturbing: The woman said her daughter has been struggling with mental problems and had a fascination with demons and death

The teen had been fascinated with the macabre, writing about demons and insanity, and drawing vicious-looking creatures.

Then one night, the mother came home from work, entered the kitchen and came face to face with her daughter wearing a white mask.

The 13-year-old allegedly grabbed a kitchen knife and attacked her mother, leaving her with cuts on her neck and face, and a puncture wound to her back.

The woman says that during the knife attack, her daughter mentioned playing a role and did not appear to be herself.

Creepy: Slender Man is a prevalent internet myth that has been a viral sensation since it emerged online in 2009

Last week, the Ohio mother heard of the brutal attack in Wisconsin, where Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both 12, allegedly stabbed their schoolmate 19 times and left her for dead in a bid to impress the mythological character Slender Man.

According to court documents, the girls' plan was to murder the victim - what they referred to amongst themselves as 'stabby, stab, stab’ - and then join Slender Man in his mansion supposedly located somewhere in a national park.

The kids reportedly learned about the demon-like figure on creepypasta.wikia.com, a website dedicated to horror stories and urban legends.

The Ohio woman says that after following the news coverage from Wisconsin, she examined her daughter’s writings and discovered multiple references to Slender Man and killing.

Miracle: Despite her many knife wounds, the 12-year-old victim (pictured on a gurney) was able to crawl for help and ended up surviving the attack

'She even crated a world for Slender Man in the game MineCraft,' the woman revealed.

Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier are facing up to 60 years in prison if convicted.

Their 12-year-old victim miraculously survived the gruesome attack and was discharged from the hospital Friday.
