It's the moment every Lottery player dreams of; that ‘money for nothing’ feeling of winning a big prize on a scratchcard that cost only a few pounds.

But in the case of grandmother Grace Walker, it was probably just as well she picked up a million – because she has been spending thousands of pounds a year in an attempt to win a top prize.

As she celebrated her win yesterday, the housewife from Hamilton, Lanarkshire, admitted she has been buying up to 30 scratchcards a week, costing £1-£5, for the past few years.

That means she could have spent up to £600 a month for more than two years – almost £15,000 in total. But the investment has paid off.

Mother of three Mrs Walker, 49, said she had not slept and had eaten only a plum since her win was confirmed on Saturday. 

She added that she had been in floods of tears and nearly fainted when she realised she had become Scotland’s latest millionaire.

She celebrated her win with champagne at the Strathaven Hotel along with 48-year-old husband William.

The couple said their children, Siobhan, 28, Kevin 27, and Michelle 22, could not believe their mother was a millionaire, as she had often tried to fool them in the past.

Mrs Walker was at home on Saturday with Michelle, after buying her scratchcard at a local store, when she realised she had won.

She said: ‘I go to the shop every Saturday and buy a card. I usually buy about 30 cards a week, I’ve been doing it for a long time.

‘I started to scratch the lines then I got to the bottom and when I saw it was a million I just couldn’t stop thinking I had to get my daughter over to check.

‘Normally I wind up her and her brother and tell them I’ve won £100 or something. But she came over, looked at it, looked at me. She started howling and said, “Mum, you’ve won a million”. I nearly fainted. The tears were just coming.’

'The world is your oyster': Yet Mr Walker said he has no plans to give his job as a removals man, and Mrs Walker said she would continue to 'enjoy the thrill' of buying lottery scratchcards

Mrs Walker won her £1million on the £100million Cash Spectacular Game card. Asked why she had picked the winning card, she said: ‘It was my favourite colour, pink.’

She added: ‘I won’t stop buying scratchcards, though, I enjoy the thrill of it, knowing it could be me.’

Mrs Walker said the family would remain in their council house in Hamilton’s Fairhill, adding: ‘I’ve lived here for 30 years and I love it.’

‘Two of our children live at home. One of them wants to get a dog, she would love a pug. And I’ve only got a £60 phone so I’m going for an iPhone with the winnings.’

Mr Walker said he had no plans to give up his job as a removals man but did concede: ‘You can do anything you want with a million pounds. The world is your oyster.’
