An 11-year-old girl arrested during rioting smirked and refused to apologise to a judge when she appeared in court this morning.

Nottingham magistrates heard the youngster had not yet began senior school having finished at primary school only last month.

The court heard the defendant, who can't be named because of her age, had travelled 16 miles on Tuesday from her foster home in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, to Nottingham city centre.

Prosecutor Sumaiya Saeedullah said the girl was in a MacDonald's restaurant in the centre of Nottingham with a friend at around 7pm when she heard talk of there being a riot.

Ms Saeedullah said the defendant later told police she had been in a 'happy mood' because she was about to take part in a riot.

She
left the fast food restaurant and joined a group of about 30 males and 
three other girls. Most of them masked their faces with bandannas. The 
prosecutor described what happened next as 'a large scale rampage'.

The
11-year-old was seen by witnesses hurling stones at shop windows. They 
gave a description of the girl to police who arrested her on Milton 
Street in Nottingham city centre between 11.30pm and midnight on 
Tuesday.

She had been in custody until her court appearance this morning.

District
Judge Morris Cooper heard the mixed race girl, who looks older than her
age, made full admissions to police after she had been arrested.

She
told officers she had been 'egged on' by others present, grabbed stones
from a plant pot and hurled them at two fashion shop windows, New Look 
and Flannels.

During the interview she told police that she knew she was taking part in a serious disturbance but 'wasn't bothered'.

She
told police: 'I knew it was going to be bad, I just went along with 
everyone else. I knew I could get into serious trouble but none of us 
thought we were going to get caught.'

The court heard she had received a caution for criminal damage in 2010.

During
the proceedings she at times laughed and chatted with two male security
guards who sat with her in the dock behind a glass panel.

Judge Cooper asked the girl's 
solicitor, Lauren Manuel: 'Does she have any indication how serious this
is?' to which Ms Manuel replied: 'She now realises it was more than 
just messing about. Her understanding of what happened is limited 
because of her age.'

The defendant's father was in court and spoke up on her behalf.

He
said: 'She knows what she has done and wants to say sorry. She is going
through a bad time at the moment and just ran away from her foster 
place. She has got a sister going through care.'

When prompted twice by her father to 
apologise to the judge for what she had done the girl said nothing, 
smirked and looked away.

She admitted an offence of criminal damage and another of attempted criminal damage.

A student has been jailed for six months for looting a £3.50 case of water from Lidl during the violence that erupted across the streets of London this week.

Nicholas Robinson, 23, was walking back from his girlfriends house in Brixton in the early hours of Monday morning when he saw the superstore on Acre Lane being looted by rioters. 

He took the opportunity to go in and help himself to a case of water because he was 'thirsty'.

But when the police came in, at around 2.40am, he discarded the bottles and attempted to flee the scene. He was caught and arrested by officers at the scene.  Wearing a black leather jacket, the electrical engineering student, looked shocked as he was jailed by District Judge Alan Baldwin at Camberwell Magistrates Court today.

There were gasps from the public gallery as the judge handed down the maximum penalty he could to Robinson, who has no previous convictions, for his part in the 'chaos'.

District Judge Baldwin said: 'The burglary of commercial premises in circumstances such as this, where substantial and serious public disorder is or has taken place is commonly known as looting.'Robinson, from south London, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a charge of burglary of a place other than other than a dwelling (theft).  

Zahid Hussain, prosecuting, said: 'This defendant has contributed through his action to criminal activities to the atmosphere of chaos and sheer lawlessness.'

Robinson claimed it was an 'opportunistic' crime, and he only went in when he saw the store unsecure and wanted a drink. 

The Judge told her: 'You are only 11. This is very serious but because of your age you are going to to get a referral order.'

The Judge told the girl that as part 
of the referral order she and her father would have to cooperate with a 
Youth Offending Team and added the order would be for nine months. 

'Nine months is much longer than usual, but that is to reflect the seriousness of what happened,' the Judge added.

Outside of court the girl pulled her hood tight to hide her face while her father hurled angry abuse at photographers.

Three 14-year-old boys have also been charged with violent disorder in the city which was rocked by violence in copy-cat riots.

In a separate incident, a
gang of youths in the St Anns area of the city, which has a long 
history of gun crime,  hurled petrol bombs at a police station, setting 
it alight.

Dozens more cars were damaged and a container of 200 tyres was set alight.

Nottinghamshire
Police said 105 people have been arrested following the violence in the
city and 46 people have so far been charged.

Although police dealt with a handful 
of incidents of criminal damage, there were only four arrests overnight,
compared with 86 during the previous evening.

Assistant
Chief Constable Paul Scarrott, who commanded last night's policing 
operation, said: 'On Monday night, there were sporadic and serious 
incidents of criminality.

'That night, our tactic was to repel and separate large groups of youths intent on congregating in the city and suburbs.

'On Tuesday night, we warned that our tactics would be different.

'Again
we drove the hooligans back, but this time we made many arrests. We 
prevented widespread looting and major fires, and despite attacks on 
police officers, vehicles and police stations, we stood firm and 
demonstrated that we would not tolerate such behaviour.

'Last night, we had our strongest presence yet on the streets, lest anyone had failed to get the zero-tolerance message.'

'For that reason, we will continue to 
have at our disposal significant numbers of officers on duty, throughout
the city and elsewhere, ready to respond 24/7 for the coming days and 
nights.'

The court case with the 11-year-old came as a 12-year-old boy admitted burglary in Manchester.

The youngster, who cannot be named because of his age, appeared ashamed, telling the court: 'I did the wrong thing.'

But outside court his mother, asked by reporters why her son was looting, replied: 'Watch your f******  face!' and the youngster told one photographer to 'f***    off!'

He was the latest to appear in the dock at Manchester Magistrates Court following a night of lawlessness in the city on Tuesday.

Some shamefaced defendants appeared to have got caught up in the general lawlessness and looked contrite as they stood in the dock, while others, with long records, shrugged their shoulders.

All those who admitted their involvement in the looting will be sentenced at Manchester Crown Court.
