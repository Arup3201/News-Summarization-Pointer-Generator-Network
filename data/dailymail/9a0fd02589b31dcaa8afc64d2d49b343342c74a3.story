A disturbing satellite image has revealed a vast toxic spill off the coast of China that is so large it can be seen from space.

A plume of waste water the size of 50 Olympic-sized swimming pools has been photographed close to the coastline of Shishi, in China’s south.

The city, which has a population of 300,000, is one of the country’s key producers of garments and textiles.

Toxic plume: Waste water dumped off the coast of China is caught on satellite camera. It is believed to be the result of factories flushing water used in the dyeing of clothes directly into the ocean

The toxic sludge seems to have come from a submerged pipe that belongs to the Haitian Environmental Engineering Co Ltd (Haitian WWTP), which processes waste water from the 19 fabric-dyeing facilities in the area.

Last year, the Haitian WWTP was fined 100,000RMB (just under £10,000) for discharging untreated waste water directly into the ocean.

There are 435 discharge points like this one along China’s coast, which release a combined total of 32.2 billion tonnes of waste water every year, according to Greenpeace.

The incident is similar to the chemical spill last year that contaminated the Longjigang River in the southern Chinese Guangxi Province, threatening the water supply of millions of people.

The discovery of 80 times the official limit of cadmium in the river, a chemical used to manufacture batteries and paints, sparked calls by environmental activists for more corporate and government accountability over industrial waste.

The photos of the toxic waste water have emerged at a time when the world is focused on China’s dangerous pollution levels.

Large parts of eastern China have suffered such dense smog this winter that officials, metereologists, and environmental activists have called for a ban on fireworks during Chinese New Year.

Fireworks are a traditional part of Chinese New Year celebrations, the noise and colours are believed to scare off evil spirits and bring good luck for the coming year. But they also release particulates into the atmosphere.

The LA Times reported that several cities have restricted the number of days residents are allowed to use fireworks, such as the city of Hangzhou, which is only allowing fireworks on three days during the holiday, compared to 18 days last year.

'We have been choking on the smog': A newspaper editorial encouraged Chinese residents to forgo fireworks to reduce air pollution

An article in the state-run China Daily newspaper urged individuals to do their part during the holiday season to reduce air pollution.

It said: ‘Some may argue that burning firecrackers is a traditional part of Chinese culture. But culture derives from life and changes with the times.

‘Since we have been choking on the smog that at times makes people only yards in front of us almost invisible, it should be common sense that we express our joy and wishes at the new year without coughing and spluttering on the after-effects of fireworks.

‘We hope by setting off fewer fireworks the city can breathe easier in the Chinese New Year.'
