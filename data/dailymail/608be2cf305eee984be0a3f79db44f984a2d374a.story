A man was today arrested after a young woman was apparently stabbed to death on a busy commercial road.

The 24-year-old Romanian immigrant collapsed in a fast-food chicken shop in Ilford, Essex shortly after midnight.

She was given first aid by paramedics and taken to hospital for treatment, but doctors were unable to save her.

Killing: A 24-year-old woman was apparently stabbed to death on this road in Ilford, Essex

Investigation: Police are currently looking into the death of the Romanian woman

The woman died from her stab wounds at the Royal London Hospital around 2am.

This afternoon a 48-year-old man was arrested in connection with her death, and he is in custody at a police station in East London.

The streets around the scene of the stabbing have been closed to traffic while inquiries are ongoing.

Police have confirmed that they know the identity of the victim, but will not make it public until her next of kin have been informed.

A post-mortem examination was scheduled to take place this afternoon to establish the cause of her death.

Shutdown: Streets around the scene of the death have been temporarily closed to traffic

Horror: Witnesses described how the nearby streets were flooded with police after the killing

Locals described seeing the victim stagger into Pizza and Chicken 4 U before collapsing to the floor.

'There was someone lying in the chicken shop but I could just see their feet,' a neighbour told the Ilford Recorder.

'They pulled the shutters down because people were staring. I've never seen so many police in my life.'

A 40-year-old man who lives on the street where the attack took place said: 'The first I heard of it was about midnight when the police knocked on my door to ask if I had seen anything - I woke up because my son was crying.

'There were police everywhere and lots of sirens. I think she was stabbed in the street and then ran into the chicken shop.'

He said there have been problems with prostitution in the neighbourhood, adding: 'It's a problem that we have in the area and something that residents are very concerned about.'

Cordon: Officers from Scotland Yard's homicide department are helping to investigate

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Police were called by London Ambulance Service at approximately 12.15am today to reports of a woman injured in Ilford Lane, Ilford, near the junction with Loxford Lane.

'Officers attended and the woman, no further details, was treated for a stab injury.

'She was taken to an east London hospital where she died at 1.53am.

'Officers from Redbridge are on scene and the Homicide and Major Crime Command have been informed.'
