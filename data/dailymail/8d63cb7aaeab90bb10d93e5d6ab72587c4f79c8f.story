Lewis Hamilton feels his level of maturity will stand him in good stead for a potential tilt this year at a second Formula One world title.

Off the back of strong form in pre-season testing as Mercedes racked up the most kilometres and Hamilton posted the second quickest time, both he and they start as favourites to win the championship.

It is a tag, however, that does not sit too well with Hamilton nor Mercedes Motorsport boss Toto Wolff bearing in mind a wheel has not yet turned in anger at a grand prix.

Only come qualifying for this weekend's Australian Grand Prix will the teams disover where they truly stand in the pecking order as F1's new era, after a raft of regulation changes, begins in earnest.

And only then will Hamilton learn if he really is in with a chance of becoming a double world champion after claiming his maiden crown in 2008.

The 29-year-old said: 'Everything happens for a reason, and from the ups and downs, the different experiences I've had, I've learned a lot.

'I've had bumps along the way, but I always feel like I've bounced back from them. It's not how you fall, it's how you get back up.

'So through all those experiences, you just brush the dirt off your shoulder and you keep going.

'I'm still enjoying my life, and my famly and I are in a position we never thought we'd be, coming from a one-bedroom flat in Stevenage.

'So we're embracing the opportunity, I'm embracing it. I feel very fortunate to be here, amongst these drivers, driving for Mercedes. It's just a dream.

'I'm 29 now. It feels like a long, long time since I started - I'm starting to get with the older guys - and I feel like I'm maturing.

'So hopefully that will show in my results, my performances, the things I say and do.

'I'm still young at heart and I'm sure I'll make some mistakes along the way, but that's part of life.'

Hamilton can understand why F1 observers are hailing Mercedes as successors to Red Bull's crown given what unfolded in testing, and why they have been labelled as favourites.

But he added: 'Everyone is talking us up and predicting the future, but we really can't say what's going to happen this weekend.

'We know we're strong, we've left no stone unturned, we've done absolutely everything we could possibly do.

'We're hoping we'll be at the front, which is our goal, but we can't say it's going to be the case.

'So coming here, saying this is going to be the best chance I have over the years, I don't know, I haven't even got in the car and raced yet.

'I had a good year in 2012 which was a strong year, and I probably had an opportunity in 2010 which I didn't optimise on, so I've had some chances in the past.

'It is a long, long year, and a long time since I won the world championship. It feels like a long time ago.

'But I'm still here and a lot more motivated from when I was before, more focused than ever before.

'So if the package is there then we will do the job, and there's no reason why we can't fight at the front again.'

No 1: Vettel believes those who write him and Red Bull off are acting rashly

Meanwhile, reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel has warned his critics to write off at their peril his chances of him becoming only the second driver in Formula One history to win five successive world titles.

Following a wretched pre-season of testing in which the new Red Bull often ground to a halt, the odds are on Vettel failing to even cross the line in Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand Prix, never mind stretching his winning streak to 10 races after taking the chequered flag in the final nine of last year.

The Milton Keynes-based team encountered a raft of problems with the RB10 - with Vettel continuing his trend of providing his car with a girl's name and this year calling it Suzie - that has placed them firrnly on the back foot going into the race around Melbourne's Albert Park.

It has been suggested the car appears quick enough, and if Red Bull can get on top of their reliability issues then Vettel could again be in the hunt for another crown.

Dismissing a suggestion that a fifth consecutive championship was not on the cards, Vettel said: 'That's unfair to say.

'Our season testing, our preparation hasn't been ideal, and we're not in the best position for this race.

'But it's a different story for the championship because there is a long way to go.

'Two years ago I remember being on the grid (on pole) and (Fernando) Alonso was 1.5 seconds behind me, but he came very close to beating me for the title at the very last race.

'So it shows anything can happen. That's why this race is important as any other, and there are a lot of races to go.

'Of course, we know we're not in the best shape yet and there are a lot of things we need to solve, but unfortunately you can't solve them all overnight. We'd love to, but we can't.

'We have to go step by step, be as precise as we can, trying to give the best feedback possible to the engineers.'

The past few weeks have arguably been some of the toughest for the 26-year-old since he arrived at Red Bull, prompting the question as to how he will react.

Naturally, Vettel has every intention of continuing to give his all, even when the chips might be down.

'At this stage it's difficult for all of us to know what to expect as to how the racing will look, how it will feel inside the car, how many cars will cross the line,' added Vettel.

'We had a lot of problems during the test, as did others, so it's difficult to have any sort of expectations.

'But I'm not going out to simply make it round, rather to the push to the maximum, to do the best I can, and then we'll see where we are and how far we get.

'The target is to finish, and to be in the best possible position.

'As to mindset, it's fairly straightforward for the rest of the year - we're a strong team, we have a lot of good people on board, we've good resources, so we should progress as the season moves on.'
