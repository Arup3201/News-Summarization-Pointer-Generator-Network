Colorado residents are urging a restaurant owner to change the name of his business due to its 'social context.'

Pete Turner, owner of 'Illegal Petes', a Boulder-based restaurant chain serving oversized burritos, listened to a concerned crowd in Fort Collins Wednesday as they urged him to change the name of his business, saying it was offensive to immigrants, according to the Coloradoan. 

CBS Denver reports that nearly 50 people attended the meeting including community members and Colorado State University students and faculty. 

Turner reportedly told the crowd that the name is a literary reference to a bar in a novel he read as an English major in Boulder. Turner also told the crowd that he has helped pay for some of his employees to become citizens. 

But crowd member, Lucy Gonzales, 25, told Pete to drop the 'illegal' -- or 'I-word' -- in the name and many likened the term to racial slurs toward African-Americans. 

Kim Medina, Fort Collins immigration attorney and meeting moderator, said the issue was one of a social nature.

'Social context is hugely important,' Medina said at the meeting. 'We'll never get to big issues, such as immigration reform, until we can solve these smaller issues of language.'

The meeting comes almost three weeks before Turner is scheduled to open a new 'Illegal Pete's' in the town, according to the Coloradoan.

Turner's attendance at the meeting was prompted by a letter written to him from Antero Garcia, Colorado State University assistant English professor, the Coloradoan reports. 

In the letter, Garcia wrote: 'The restaurant will be located in the same area that current Fort Collins residents remember often seeing signs saying 'No dogs or Mexicans.' It is under this legacy of American racist practices that the name 'Illegal Pete's' becomes unacceptable.'

And at the meeting, Garcia said that Turner's resturant would instill violence in the community. 

Fort Collins: Nearly 50 Fort Collins residents gathered at a meeting Wednesday to demand that Turner change the name of the restaurant, just weeks before the new location's opening 

Reference: Turner said that the restaurant's name is a literary reference to a book he read in college and never intended to offend anyone 

After many shared personal experiences about growing up in Fort Collins during times of harsh racial descrimination, Turner said he couldn't imagine living that way, CBS reports.

Though  he could empathize with the group, Turner said he did not realize the issue was one regarding free speech and said he believes he has a right to name his business what ever he chooses.

Cheryl Distaso, coordinator of the social justice nonprofit Fort Collins Community Action Network, said that the restaurant's name is dehumanizing and she is confident that Turner will 'do the right thing.' 

Locations: The restaurant has six locations in Denver and Boulder, the Fort Collins location would be the seventh with Turner planning to open an eighth in Tuscan, Ariz. 

Turner said at the meeting that he had a lot to consider when deciding whether to change the name of his restaurant. 

Medina said that, in the meantime, Fort Collins residents would be mobilizing themselves 'either to celebrate or to protest.' 

'Illegal Pete's' has six locations in Boulder and Denver, Fort Collins would be its seventh location. Turner is planning to open another location in Tuscan, Ariz. as well.
