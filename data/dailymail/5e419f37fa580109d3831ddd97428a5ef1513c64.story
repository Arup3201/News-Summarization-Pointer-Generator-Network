The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall were full of festive cheer on a charity visit today - and even brought along their own baubles.

On a rare joint engagement to open the new Barnardo's headquarters at Barkingside, Essex, the monarch and her daughter-in-law hung their decorations on the charity's brightly-coloured Christmas tree to the cheers of dozens of children helped by the organisation.

Specially commissioned through the Royal Collection, the  Queen's was made from red velvet with her cypher sewn on in golden thread, while Camilla's was blue velvet decoration was embroidered in silver.

The Queen has been patron of the charity, which helps more than 200,000 vulnerable children in the UK each year, since 1983, while Camilla was appointed its president in 2007.

As one of the largest children's charities in the country, due to celebrate its 150th anniversary in 2016, it has boasted a royal patron since 1902.

The Queen and the Duchess arrived together this afternoon in a chauffeur-driven Bentley.

The sovereign was wearing a white, lavender and baby blue tweed coat by Stewart Parvin and a Rachel Trevor-Morgan hat, while Camilla was wearing a dove grey coat and dress by Bruce Oldfield.

The choice was particularly appropriate as Mr Oldfield, a long time royal designer, is an ex Barnardo's Boy himself and is now Vice President of the charity.

Decorations: The duo were handed a red stocking each - with For The Queen and For The Duchess sewn onto them - as a gift from the children

Matching accessories: Pearl earrings and necklaces were the order of the day for the royal pair

He said: 'We only did the final fitting last week and delivered it to the Duchess on Friday. I was very touched she chose to wear it today.

'Barnardo's is an unbelievable organisation that supported me throughout my childhood, my schooling and even helped me, financially, to start my own business at the age of 25.

'We've been together for 63 years.'

The Duchess clearly agreed when she met him, saying: 'It's a fantastic organisation, isn't it.'

She and the Queen were shown round the new hi-tech headquarters, which has been built next to the original 'Girls' Village Home' created by Thomas Barnardo in 1873 to house a small group of vulnerable young women.

Although the organisation supports a wide variety of projects now, including those targeting the abuse and sexual exploitation of young children and others supporting young carers, the royals had asked for a briefing on another of its top priorities, the urgent need to recruit more adopters.

Around 4,000 children are put up for adoption each year but many prospective parents are put off by the notoriously bureaucratic and inefficient system that currently operates.

The situation is even worse for  children who are labelled 'hard to place', which includes youngsters from challenged backgrounds, siblings and older children.

This year half of those on the Adoption Register were brothers and sisters, with just 35 per cent of adopters willing to consider more than one child.

And with the average age of adoption being three years and eight months, children aged over four are suffering too.

The proportion of children being adopted is one in three when the child is four, but that plummets to one in 15 when the child turns five.

Race has also become an issue as a white child is three times more likely to be adopted than a black child, with the charity calling on more ethnic minority parents to come forward.

Before they left, the Queen and the Duchess were given their baubles to hang on a tree in the HQ's foyer.

'They are lovely, aren't they? Are we going to put them on the tree?' The Queen asked her daughter-in-law.

They were then handed a red stocking each - with For The Queen and For The Duchess sewn onto them - as a gift from the children.

They had been made by Skye, eight, and
 Summer, seven, two sisters who are supported by the Barnardo's Basildon
 Children's Centre.

'Is this for me?' The Queen asked.

'How lovely.'

'I suppose I am not allowed to peek am I,' said the Duchess.

'But aren't they gorgeous, huge fun. It even has my name on the front!'

After a brief walkabout, collecting armfuls of flowers from well-wishers, the pair departed.

Acting Chief Executive Peter Brook described the visit as a 'huge honour'.

'Her Majesty and the Duchess are very committed supporters of our work,' he said.

'In recent years our remit has changed enormously but the golden thread that runs through our work remains the same - and that's never to turn away a vulnerable child that needs our help.'

Gifts: The Queen and Camilla were given gifts of flowers and Christmas stockings by well wishers
