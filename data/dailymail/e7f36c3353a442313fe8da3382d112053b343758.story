Free bus passes are spreading good health among older people, a report by scientists said yesterday.

They found that over-60s who take advantage of their right to free bus travel are also likely to walk and take exercise.

The research project concluded that the benefits for older people who use buses include better mobility and strength and a lower risk of heart disease, falls and broken bones.

Promoting good health: Over-60s who take advantage of free bus passes are likely to walk more and take other exercise, scientists said

The findings, carried out by 
researchers from the School of Public Health at Imperial College, come 
as David Cameron is under growing pressure to scrap the perk of free bus
passes for over-60s, which costs taxpayers £1.1billion a year.

The bus passes have been a target for 
cost-cutters since the recession began and their high cost has attracted
growing controversy.

The Prime Minister has promised to keep the 
system, which is extremely popular among older voters, but ministers 
including Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and some LibDems
think the right to free bus travel should be means tested.

Mr Cameron’s line is likely to get a 
boost from the research report, which said both better off and poorer 
people get health benefits from bus travel.

Sophie Coronini-Cronberg, who led the 
project, said: ‘Given the need to encourage older people to be 
physically active, it is good news that the provision of free bus passes
seems to be having a positive impact.

‘Before the Government looks at 
reforming the scheme, they should make sure we understand its value to 
society.’

The study, based on information from four years of the 
National Travel Survey, which examines the travel habits of more than 
16,000 people.

It showed that over-60s with a free 
bus pass are more likely to walk frequently and to engage in what 
academics describe as ‘active travel’.

This include, walking, cycling and using public transport, which in turn is likely to require walking.

The survey showed that the year before
free bus passes were introduced, 2005, 56.8 per cent of people were 
using buses.

By 2008, the percentage of bus users had grown to 74.7 per 
cent.

It also showed that the main reason that someone does not walk or engage in ‘active travel’ is that they have a car.

A reason for greater health among bus 
users, the report said, is ‘incidental’ exercise walking to and from bus
stops and around towns and other destinations visited by travellers 
with free passes.

Bus travel, it added, is most common 
among older people in towns and cities. In small towns and the 
countryside, where bus services are usually limited, older people are 
more likely to walk.

But passes were introduced by then 
Chancellor Gordon Brown in 2006.

They currently give pass holders free 
travel on many buses after the morning peak hour and all day at weekends
and holidays.

The cost of the passes has been in 
question since 2009, when local councils began to question the amount 
bus companies were charging and to consider whether the passes should be
means-tested.
