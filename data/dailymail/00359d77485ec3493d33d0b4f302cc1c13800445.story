Servando 'LaTuta' Gomez, 49, was caught on Friday in Morelia, Michoacan's state capital after months of intelligence work

One of Mexico's most wanted drug lords, 'La Tuta', has been captured. 

Servando Gomez, 49, was caught on Friday in Morelia, Michoacan's state capital after months of intelligence work by Mexican security forces.

He was cornered in a house in a peaceful showdown  where no shots were fired - making him the second drug kingpin to fall in just over a year.

Gomez, is implicated in the 2009 murder of 12 Mexican federal police officers, according to the United States Justice Department.

He is also wanted by the U.S. government for methamphetamine and cocaine trafficking. 

A Mexican police spokesman said: 'He will be brought to Mexico City in the coming hours to make a declaration.' 

His arrest marks a victory for Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto as he grapples with grisly gang violence and attempts to quell outrage over violence, impunity and corruption in Mexico.

He is battling against lingering public anger over the September abduction and apparent massacre of 43 trainee teachers by corrupt police in league with gang members.

Gomez, who had a $2 million bounty on his head before his arrest, was known as La Tuta' because he was a former teacher and left his profession to become a drug boss.

But he became the prime target of Pena Nieto's drive to regain control of Michoacan.

Last year, in another coup, Cartel boss Joaquin 'Shorty' Guzman, head of the Sinaloa Cartel, a powerful drug smuggling gang was captured.

He was cooking breakfast along with his beauty queen wife when police smashed down the door of the condo where they were hiding in Mazatlan, a beach resort town on Mexico's Pacific Coast. 

Both Guzman and Gomez were feared drug lords. However the man caught up in the country's latest sting, Gomez, often sought the limelight.

Whether railing against political corruption on YouTube, or
giving interviews in hideouts to the media, Gomez relentlessly
baited the government.

He continuously accused officials of colluding with rival gangs
while defending his Knights Templar as a 'necessary evil.'

'Our only function is to help the people, preserve our
state, and preserve our country from people causing terror,'
Gomez said in a video posted online in 2012, sitting in front of
images of Ernesto 'Che' Guevara and other revolutionary icons.

Gomez insisted the cartel followed a strict ethical code,
though as time passed he became more open about the criminal
side of a gang.

In 2013 it held much of the impoverished,
mountainous terrain of Michoacan in a firm grip and often extorted a
broad sweep of businesses.

They also controlled politicians and
diversified from drug trafficking into a myriad of other
businesses including the export of iron ore.

Gomez became the front man of the Knights Templar after a
split within drug cartel La Familia Michoacana, a
pseudo-religious gang in which he was also a leading figure.

Sporting a goatee beard and often wearing a baseball cap,
Gomez began smuggling marijuana independently in 2001 or 2002,
before later joining La Familia, authorities said. 

The area is a violent western state wracked by clashes between Gomez's Knights Templar cartel and heavily-armed vigilantes trying to oust them. 

Last week, police seized many properties there and
arrested a handful of people connected to La Tuta. 

Local media
reported that an earlier operation had led to the arrest of the
drug boss. Police also arrested a number of other people with him.

Since the Mexican government began a military crackdown in
2007 on drug gangs, more than 100,000 people have been killed in
drug-related violence.
