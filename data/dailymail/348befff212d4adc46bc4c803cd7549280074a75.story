A conman who appeared on Bravo's 'Millionaire Matchmaker' and turned out not to be a millionaire has been sentenced to eight years in a federal prison for fraud.

Michael Prozer boasted on television that he owned the South Ameircan PayPal, was worth $400 million, flew by private jet and lived in a mansion on Davis Island in Tampa.

It was however, all a facade, created using wire, bank and mail fraud on a multi-million dollar scale leading to the 38-year-old using his appearance on the show to convince those he robbed that he was in fact a genuine millionaire.

Michael Prozer once claimed to be worth $400 million and that he owned a private jet. In reality he was a conman who had fraudulently scammed $3 million from a bank

Pozer, who had the New York Yankee's Derek Jeter as a neighbour, appeared on season two of the hit Bravo series that attempts to match single rich people with potential wives or husbands.

During his appearance on the show, Pozer, who is father to two young boys, told the audience that he was the multi-millionaire CEO of Xchange Agent Inc, an online payment service for people in South America.

Viewers saw his 33,000 square-foot home set on 26 acres and discovered that despite all his apparent wealth he could not find a wife to share it with.

His appearance on the show was not successful after Prozer upset his date Elana by showing off on a jet ski.

However, a federal indictment in April of 2010 exposed the fact that Pozer took a loan from the Park Avenue Bank based on fake, non-existent collateral after asking a man named Fedor Salinas, a Wachovia Bank employee, to falsify documents verifying the existence of these funds.

Basically, Prozer paid Salinas $25,000 to pretend that he had $21 million in assets and therefore secure a $3 million loan with which he began renting the mansion and joined a scheme to share a private jet.

Prozer told the bank, which has now closed down, that he also required operating funds for his business.

'I do take responsibility for what had happened,' said Prozer on Thursday at his sentencing hearing.

Apologising to the court for wasting their time and that of government agents who began to investigate him after he failed to pay back an installment on his loan and rent on his mansion.

'I've done a lot of good things,' he said according to Tampa Bay Online.

'This case makes it look like I'm a horrible person.'

After he was unable to secure the services of high profile Florida lawyer Barry Cohen, Prozer decided to change his plea to guilty in April.

It all fell apart for the conman when he ran out of money and could not transfer one fraudulent scheme to another

Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Sweeney said that Prozer was a skilled conman and intended to use his appearance on the Bravo show to bolster his front as a millionaire to con more money out of investors.

'That's a pattern we saw again, and again and again,' said Sweeney.

'Everybody trusted Mr. Prozer. He was very good at putting on a facade that he was wealthy.'

Sweeney revealed that Prozer had initially tried to scam $18 million from Park Avenue Bank, but dropped this amount because the bank could clear $3 million quicker.

Sweeney asked U.S. District Judge Virginia M. Hernandez Covington to impose the maximum sentence under federal guidelines â€“ nine years.

In addition, Fedor Salinas was sentenced to 27 months after he too pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail, wire and bank fraud.
