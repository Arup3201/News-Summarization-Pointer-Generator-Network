Cristiano Ronaldo believes Portugal are an ‘average side’ and conceded he never thought his team stood any chance of winning the World Cup.

The Real Madrid star, speaking after his side’s dramatic draw with the USA, believes that to say his side are 'limited' and that to say they are a top team would be a 'lie'.

Portugal are currently sit bottom of Group G with just a single point from two games, rescued by their dramatic late equaliser against the USA when Ronaldo crossed for team-mate Silvestre Varela to convert.

'Average': Cristiano Ronaldo believes that his Portugal team never had a chance of winning the World Cup

Double act: Nani scored the first for Portugal, whilst Ronaldo's superb cross salvaged a late equaliser

It will take a minor miracle for them to qualify for the second round, as Germany and USA, who play each other in the final round of games, both only need a draw to make it through to the last-16.

And even if the USA do lose, it will take a big swing in goal difference for the Portuguese to qualify, after their 4-0 thumping at the hands of the Germans in their opening game.

Ronaldo said: ‘Maybe we’re an average team. It would be a lie to say that we are a ‘top’ team.

‘We have many limitations and suffer from injuries such as with Pepe (who was suspended) and (Fabio) Coentrao. This limits us a lot.

Limited: Portugal were deprived of centre back Pepe against USA, following his rash sending off

Finished: And Fabio Coentrao, who was ruled out of the tournament after suffering an injury against Germany

‘We have a very limited team and we are not at the best level. This does not enable you to beat top teams.

‘There are no miracles. We knew we would have a tough group, with perhaps teams better than us. I never thought we could be world champions, we have to be humble and know our level.

‘I’m not a hypocrite, I never thought we could win the tournament.’

Provided that assist for his side's dramatic late equaliser against USA

Portugal have one point from two games and are unlikely to qualify

Germany and USA only need a draw in final game for both to go through
