Nigella Lawson's ambition to crack America has suffered a huge setback, with the cancellation of her cookery show The Taste.

The 55-year-old initially charmed the States with her saucy double entendres and figure-hugging 'wiggle dresses'. But viewers lost their appetite for her reality TV show – and ratings plunged as dramatically as her cleavage-baring necklines.

Now executives at the ABC network are about to announce that the show won't be returning for a fourth season.

Nigella Lawson's American cookery show The Taste has been cancelled after viewing figures dropped dramatically

A source told The Mail on Sunday. 'Staff have been told to take alternative employment and not to wait for The Taste to go back into production – it's over. It had a good run and Nigella is definitely better known in America now than she was before, but the show was haemorrhaging viewers.'

The Taste launched in January 2013, attracting an audience of 5.8 million. But figures for the last series, which ended in January this year, fell to less than half that, with a low of 2.7 million.

'It just kept sliding in the ratings,' the source added. 'People were tuning out in droves.'

The Taste involved chefs competing to create a single perfect spoonful. As its star and executive producer, the Domestic Goddess earned a reported £150,000 an episode.

Critics warmed to Nigella's 'polish and humour', but branded the show 'boring'.

A source told The Mail on Sunday: 'It's an open secret that The Taste is not coming back for a fourth season. ABC are actively looking for an alternative cookery show. But the fact it lasted three seasons is no disgrace at all.'

The UK version suffered a similar fate, surviving for just one series on Channel 4 last year.

ABC said last night: 'No official decision has been made regarding another season of The Taste.'
