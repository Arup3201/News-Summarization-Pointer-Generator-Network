Warm, woolly jumpers are a staple in most people’s winter wardrobe.

The very essence of eco-friendly fashion, they conjure images of fields filled with contented sheep — a quintessentially British scene. The use of wool is even encouraged by the Prince of Wales, patron of the global Campaign for Wool.

Although the unethical production of luxury fabrics such as cashmere and angora has (quite rightly) come under fire — thanks to distressing evidence of goats packed into atrocious factory farms, like battery hens, and live rabbits having their fur ripped out of their skin — sheep-shearing has always been deemed a pretty benign process.

The unethical production of luxury cashmere and angora has been criticised in the past, however sheep shearing has received little attention

But now some are suggesting your ordinary woolly jumper may not be as ethical as you think.

An undercover video filmed by animal rights campaigners shows sheep being hit, kicked, stabbed and stamped on by men shearing them at high speed.

The footage was filmed in 30 farms across the U.S. and Australia — the largest exporter of wool in the world, with the Chinese and Indian rag trades its biggest markets.

Since these countries manufacture cheap jumpers for the UK market, it’s an issue that feeds directly into the British High Street. And, says Peta, who made the film, it is the tip of a very large, disturbing iceberg.

‘The investigators recorded shearers as they violently punched struggling sheep and beat and jabbed them in the face with sharp shears,’ says Peta spokesperson Ben Williamson. ‘These routine attacks leave the animals bleeding from their eyes, nose and mouth.’

These revelations come on top of a long, unsuccessful campaign to ban another cruel practice in Australian sheep farms called mulesing — in which a portion of skin is carved from the sheep’s backside using shears, usually without anaesthetic, to prevent ‘flystrike’, a deadly infestation of maggots.

Brands from Marks & Spencer to John Lewis have rejected wool that comes from mulesed sheep, demanding other methods of avoiding flystrike, and New Zealand has banned it altogether, yet Australia’s wool board has delayed plans to phase out the practice.

Most sheep are bred for meat with wool as a by-product, even if the fleeces are not taken directly from a carcass

Almost all Merino wool — from an ancient breed of hardy sheep — on the High Street comes from Australia and New Zealand, including anything labelled with the Woolmark logo, and unless a brand states its opposition to mulesing, it is likely to have been subject to the practice.

Philip Brooke, welfare development manager for the organisation Compassion in World Farming, is outraged by it, saying: ‘It is unacceptable that sheep should be roughly handled, thrown around, punched, kicked or hit with sharp or blunt metal objects.’ Even the British Wool Marketing Board (BWMB), the organisation through which, by law, almost all British fleece wool must be sold, is adamant such behaviour is unacceptable.

‘I’m 61, I’ve been in the shearing industry all my life, and I have never seen sheep treated that way,’ says BWMB’s shearing training manager Colin MacGregor.

‘In the UK that would never happen. Here, when we teach young shearers it’s about respect for the animal, and keeping it calm is all in the hold. I think I can speak for every farmer in the UK: their animals are their pride and joy.’

The problem, though, is that there’s no way of knowing what you are buying. Your wool could be from China — where intensive farming is on the up, and which is now the second largest producer in the world — or from Australia or even Iran, the ninth largest producer.

Unless it is marked as British, you can have no clue.

PETA spokesman, Ben Williamson (pictured) said ‘The investigators recorded shearers as they violently punched struggling sheep and beat and jabbed them in the face with sharp shears’

‘People are able to make informed choices about their meat and know how the animal has been raised,’ says ethical sheep farmer and wool producer, Isobel Davies. ‘Yet when it comes to wool, they are given no information. Have the sheep been sheared then live-exported and traded round the globe before being slaughtered? There is simply no way of knowing.’

She uses wool from sheep rescued from slaughter and allowed to live out their days happily in her fields for her luxury brand, Izzy Lane, and has been trying with little luck to persuade the BWMB to introduce a premium wool label that takes account of welfare standards.

‘Humane, slaughter-free wool is achievable at an industrial level,’ she insists. ‘Not at Primark prices — there is inevitably a premium. But increasing numbers are turning their backs on fast fashion in favour of buying less and more ethically.’

A number of companies do make the effort to source more ethically produced wool.

British brands Icebreaker and Finisterre offer full traceability on all their fabrics, including Australian Merino wool from a non-mulesed flock, and, in Finisterre’s case, rare Bowmont sheep in Devon. The model Lily Cole’s company The North Circular works with Izzy Lane, and Jaeger has exclusive UK rights to Gostwyck wool — an Australian Merino producer that claims to have the happiest sheep in the world.

If you’re vegetarian, be under no illusions, though: most sheep are bred for meat, and wool is a by-product, even if the fleeces are not taken directly from a carcass.

Philip Brooke, (pictured) welfare development manager for the organisation Compassion in World Farming, is outraged by Peta's video revealing cruel practices in wool shearing.

‘The great thing about wool is that it’s sustainable fibre,’ says Colin MacGregor. ‘It’s not reliant on oil and it’s a fibre that keeps you warm in the winter and cool in the summer. It’s one of the greenest fibres there ever will be.’

A biodegradable, breathable fibre with no petrochemicals? Sounds like a dream — if only there was some easy way to know just what you’re getting when you buy your jumper.
