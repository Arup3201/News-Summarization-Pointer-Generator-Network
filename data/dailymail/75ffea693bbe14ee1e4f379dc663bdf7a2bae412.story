A second man has been charged in connection with missing nurse Rui Li, who is believed to have been murdered.

Her husband Pierre Legris, 60, has already been charged with her murder and will appear before Bournemouth Magistrates Court tomorrow.

His 26-year-old son, Jonathan Legris, also from Bournemouth, has now been charged with assisting an offender. He has been bailed and will appear before Bournemouth Magistrates Court on June 17.

The 44-year-old victim was last seen leaving Poole Hospital in Dorset on May 23 and was reported missing to police by her family four days later.

A body, which police 'strongly believe' 
to be that of the nurse, was then discovered in the boot of a silver 
Fiat Punto in Bournemouth, Dorset.

Legris was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of murder.

Detective Inspector Marcus Hester, of Dorset Police, said: 'Family liaison officers have updated Rui's daughter with these developments.

'This is a very difficult time for her as she tries to come to terms with the loss of her mother.

'This development does not mean we do not want to hear from members of the public if they have any information that could help with the investigation into Rui Li's death.

'We still very much want to hear from anyone who may have any information about what happened to Rui Li.

 family five days later

'In particular we would like anyone with information about the movements of two vehicles to contact police.

'A
 silver Fiat Punto with registration plate W887 PDL and a large white 
Ford Transit van with registration plate Y491 GFT, between Saturday May 
24 and Wednesday May 28.'

Formal identification has not yet taken place and the inquest will be opened in due course, a police spokesman added.

Forensic experts have examined three addresses at Burnham Drive, Wolverton Road and St Clementâ€™s Road, all in Boscombe, Dorset.

Ms Li's distinctive Porsche Boxster, with personalised number plate L1 RUI, was found outside a property in Wolverton Road.

Police
 released CCTV of the last known sighting of Ms Li, which showed her
 leaving the car park at the hospital at 6.17pm.

Detectives said she moved to the UK from China a decade ago and has worked at Poole Hospital since 2009.

They said 
Ms Li, who has a teenage daughter, led 'a private personal life' and 
officers were trying to build a picture of her lifestyle.

Her colleagues from Poole Hospital have appealed for the public's help in tracking down the missing nurse.

In a statement released by police, her colleagues from Poole Hospital said: 'Rui was a big character in our small close-knit team.

'Funny and so unique, she was totally reliable, professional and conscientious to a tee. She is terribly missed by all of us.

'Her nature was gentle and serene and that is part of the reason why we and the patients love her so much.'

Ms Li was described as a slim woman of Chinese appearance who is about 5ft 5ins. She sometimes wore glasses and often had her shoulder-length black hair in a ponytail, police said.
