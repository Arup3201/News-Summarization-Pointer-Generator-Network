When Labour hired one of Barack Obama's election guru's, they hoped he would bring some of the vote-winning magic which took him all the way to the White House.

And in Ed Miliband's New Year message, he seems to be echoing the US President's famous 'Yes we can' slogan as he insists Labour can turn Britain around, saying: 'Can we do it? Of course we can.'

On the other hand he may have taken inspiration from Bob the Builder, who famously sang: 'Can we fix it? Yes we can!'

Ed Miliband uses his New Year message to insist Labour can turn Britain around, declaring: 'Of course we can'

The Labour leader echoes Barack Obama's 'Yes we can' election slogan and Bob The Builder's 'Can we fix it... Yes we can'

Mr Miliband used his message to strike a more upbeat tone than seen from Labour in recent months, insisting next year's general election is a 'moment of possibility'. 

The festive message, apparently recorded at his home, shows Mr Miliband flanked by a Christmas tree and casually dressed in shirt and navy jumper.

'We have it within our grasp not just to see out the old year but to see out the old ways of running the country,' Mr Miliband said.

'Can we do it? Of course we can.'

'Yes we can' was chanted by supporters of Mr Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign.

Meanwhile the Bob the Builder theme tune, Can We Fix It, was the biggest selling single of 2000 and became Christmas number one that year.

In April Labour hired David Axelrod, a former top political adviser to Bill Clinton who helped Mr Obama get into the White House and keep him there. 

Mr Miliband's new year message has been overshadowed by comments by Tony Blair that Labour will not will if it lurches to  the left.

Mr Miliband said he stood for a 'new plan that cuts our deficit responsibly, without threatening our NHS or short changing our children and their future'

In his video message Mr Miliband said: 'This is the season for new beginnings and hopes for the future,' he said.

'And Britain is ready for a new beginning. Because I don't have to tell you that all over our country today, there are people working harder and harder, but standing still: families struggling with bills that are growing faster than their wages; young people, taking on mountains of debt to get a proper education, only to find themselves with no job at the other end; and an NHS where people are waiting longer and longer to get the care they need.

'It doesn't have to be this way. As this New Year dawns, we have the chance to change direction.'

Mr Miliband said he stood for a 'new plan that cuts our deficit responsibly, without threatening our NHS or short changing our children and their future'.

'This year, we have the power to bring about the change working families all over Britain need. This isn't about idle dreams or empty promises. It's about a real, concrete plan: a plan for a recovery which reaches your kitchen table.'

Mr Miliband said in the run-up to the election he would be setting out ideas to raise wages, give young people more opportunities, 'set fair rules for immigration' and 'rescue our NHS'. 

Mr Miliband cited the Labour government's achievements in the wake of the Second World War 70 years ago as proof that progress could be made despite tough conditions.

'After the war, badly battered and deeply in debt, Britain rose again,' he said.

'We built the NHS, a modern welfare state, homes for people to live in and still dealt with our debts; we set the stage for a generation of progress for working people.

'Today's challenges are different. But if we could walk through those fires, we surely can meet the problems of our time.'
