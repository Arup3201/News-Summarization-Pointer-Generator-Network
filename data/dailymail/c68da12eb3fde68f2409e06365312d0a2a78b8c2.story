JK Rowling sent fans into a frenzy by tweeting a series of cryptic messages hinting at the possibility of a comeback for Harry Potter.

The boy wizard made his final appearance in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - the seventh in the 400-million-plus selling series - published in July 2007.

Since then, although Miss Rowling has refused to rule out bringing him back, there has been no sign of another Potter book.

Harry Potter author JK Rowling sent Twitter users into a frenzy after tweeting a cryptic message to followers

So there was intense excitement after Miss Rowling, 49, tweeted on Monday: ‘Cry, foe! Run amok! Fa awry! My wand won’t tolerate this nonsense.’

Fans speculated on the meaning of the tweet for more than 24 hours, with some claiming it had a message of: ‘Harry returns! Won’t say any details now. A week off. No comment.’

By last night, it had been retweeted 17,000 times.

The tweet was followed by her saying she was ‘very busy at the moment, tweaking a screenplay and being involved in @lumos campaigns. Back when I’ve finished something.’

Lumos is her children’s charity.

The screenplay she is working on is thought to be a reference to a forthcoming series of films based on her short book Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them.

 

The British author posted a cryptic message on her page before telling followers it was 'something to ponder'

She then followed up the cryptic tweet with a series of other messages before finally confirming that her message was not in fact a reference to Harry Potter but instead to her new book - Fantastic Beasts

And last night the multi-millionaire author, who is thought to be worth more than £570 million, revealed the tweet meant: ‘Newt only meant to stay in New York for a few hours’.

Newt Scamander is the star of the spin-off, which is set to become a film trilogy.

Set in 1920s New York, he is a magizoologist - dealing with magical creatures.

Miss Rowling thanked her fans for busting the riddle, saying: ‘Thank you, thank you, for being the kind of people who get excited about an anagram.’

The seven Potter books, which made Rowling, a multimillionaire, gave rise to the hugely successful film series, eight video games and the licensing of hundreds of additional Harry Potter products.

Last year rumours of a new Harry Potter book circulated after a fake press release appeared online on April 1.

While thousands of Twitter users thought the clue was reference to a new Harry Potter book (left), the author finally confirmed that it was reference to a screenplay for her book Fantastic Beasts & Where To Find Them

Fans were hoping the cryptic message was a clue about a new sequel to the Harry Potter franchise which saw Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint star in the blockbusters based on her best-selling books

A statement on Miss Rowling’s website says in reply to the question of whether there will be another Harry Potter novel: ‘I have always refused to say "never" to this question, because I think it would be foolish to rule out something I might want to do in a few years’ time. 

'However, I have no immediate plans to write another Harry Potter novel, and I do think that I have rounded off Harry’s story in the seven published books.’

The Harry Potter series of books has sold more than 450 million copies and the brand has an estimated worth of $15 billion.

Miss Rowling has also published a novel for adults, The Casual Vacancy, and two detective thrillers under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.
