Microsoft has accused rival Google of using 'private information for profit' by snooping on people's emails.

The software giant has launched an advertising campaign warning people that Google reads every email sent by users, scanning for key words to target advertising.

A survey carried out by Microsoft found that 83 per cent of people felt that this was an invasion of privacy, while 93 per cent thought there should be an 'opt out' option for Gmail users.

It says: 'Google goes through every Gmail that's sent or received, looking for keywords so they can target Gmail users with paid ads. And there's no way to opt out of this invasion of your privacy. '

Microsoft makes the majority of its money from software sales.

One email from a user informing their friend they have had to put their cat down includes adverts for catteries and catnip products

A Google spokesperson said advertising targeting in Gmail is fully automated, and no humans read emails or Google Account information in order to show advertisements or related information

One email from a user informing their friend they have had to put their cat down includes adverts for catteries and catnip products, and another including the word 'Caribbean' features adverts for holiday firms and flights.

Bill Cox, director of strategy at the firm, told The Sun: 'The data shows most people in the UK are unaware Google is using their private information for profit.

'We’re as appalled as they are.'

Microsoft’s email version , Outlook.com, does not scan users’ emails, he said.

A Google spokesperson said: 'Ad targeting in Gmail is fully automated, and no humans read your email or Google Account information in order to show you advertisements or related information.

'We also don't deliver ads based on sensitive information, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or sensitive financial categories.'
