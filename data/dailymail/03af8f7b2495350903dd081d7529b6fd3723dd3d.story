A map of biodiversity showing the organisation of terrestrial life on Earth has been updated after more than a century.

The original map, drawn up by British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in 1876, was the first attempt to depict the myriad ways life has evolved on the world's continents.

Advances in modern technology and data on more than 20,000 species have now allowed scientists to chart biodiversity in far more detail.

Â The first attempt to describe the natural world in an evolutionary context was made in 1876 by Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer of the theory of natural selection, along with Charles Darwin.

Now his map has finally been updated.

The new map, published online by the journal Science, shows the division of nature into 11 large biogeographic realms and how they relate to each other.

Evolutionary and geographical information is combined for all known mammals, birds and amphibians - a total of more than 20,000 species.

A team of 15 international researchers took 20 years to compile the data.

Lead scientist Dr Ben Holt, from the Centre for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, said: 'Our study is a long overdue update of one of the most fundamental maps in natural sciences.

'For the first time since Wallace's attempt we are finally able to provide a broad description of the natural world based on incredibly detailed information for thousands of vertebrate species.'

The freely available map can be split into finer geographical details for each class of animal.

Co-author Dr Jean-Philippe Lessard, from McGill University in Canada, said: 'The map provides important baseline information for future ecological and evolutionary research.

'It also has major conservation significance in light of the on-going biodiversity crisis and global environmental change.'

'Whereas conservation planners have been identifying priority areas based on the uniqueness of species found in a given place, we can now begin to define conservation priorities based on millions of years of evolutionary history.'

Dr Carsten Rahbek, director of the Centre for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate, said the holistic description of the natural world provided by the map could be a 'new cornerstone in fundamental biology'.
