Has Robert Pires taken a new career path in security?

The Arsenal legend attended his wife Jessica's nude photoshoot with French photographer Jean Philippe Piter.

Accompanied with the caption 'Behind the scene with my bodyguard. Thx to @jeanphilippepiter2 got those amazing pics!!!' Pires can be seen overlooking the model.

Despite his protective presence, the former France international has decided to dust off his football boots and step out of retirement.

In July, the 40-year-old announced that he had agreed to come out of retirement to link-up with the likes of former team-mates Freddie Ljungberg and David Trezeguet, who will also be involved in the inaugural season which begins in October.

It was announced that month too that former Sweden midfielder Ljungberg had penned an ambassadorial contract with the ISL, while Pires is expected to line up for one of the league's eight teams.

The Gunners icon hung up his boots following a brief spell at Aston Villa in 2011, but the veteran is relishing a return to the game at the ripe age of 40.

He told the ISL's offical Twitter feed: 'I am very happy to be part of the new League when passion for football in India is on the rise.

'It will be great to play in front of enthusiastic Indian fans as well as share my knowledge with my team-mates.'

The ISL will run between October and December.
