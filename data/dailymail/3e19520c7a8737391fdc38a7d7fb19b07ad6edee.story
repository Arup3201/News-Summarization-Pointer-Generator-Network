On a dreary January day, it is enough to make you want to book a flight immediately.

San Francisco photographer Kien Lam has created a spectacular video documenting his 343 journey taking in 15 countries around the world.

From Australia to India and Nepal to Nicaragua, inventive Lam has stitched together 6,286 photos to create a magnificent timelapse which whisks viewers around the world in four minutes.

The slick video features his trips to 15 countries compiled from trips taken over three years. 

The  beautifully shot world tour contains an hour of real-time pictures compressed into two or three-second clips to represent the different locations.

It includes fantastic photography from the USA, Canada, Mexico, England, Scotland, Germany, Denmark, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Australia, New Zealand, India, Nepal, Nicaragua and Honduras.

The video contains an hour of real-time pictures compressed into three-second clips to represent different locations, such as Chame in Nepal 

Lam visited many of the world's most recognisable landmarks including the sacred Aboriginal sight of Uluru in central Australia

The nomadic photographer also reached some of the world's more remote regions, such as the Little Corn Island off the coast of Nicaragua

The video is a sequel to a first timelapse taken by Lam after he quit his job in 2010 and went travelling around the world, snapping photos as he went.

Lam says: 'Many people were disappointed to see that their country was not represented in my first video. Since 2012, I've managed to travel to another 15 countries and continued capturing the beauty of the world in a series of time lapses. 

'I took well over 10,000 photographs and used 6286 of those images to put together this next chapter in my journey to see as much of the world as possible.' 

'This is dedicated to all the people I've met on my travels and especially to the ones who stood still and made cameos in the video.

'Special thanks to my family for supporting everything I do and to my brother William Lam for writing the composition  

'I received a lot of beautiful emails after the first email from people who could barely string together a sentence in English, but did so anyway just to say how appreciative they are that they got to see so many beautiful places around the world in such a short time. 

'A heartwarming way to start the new year for me.'
