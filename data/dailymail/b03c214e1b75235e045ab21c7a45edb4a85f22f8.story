More than half of British women who work out are ditching sugar-dense cereals for protein-packed breakfasts.

Most female gym bunnies (57 per cent) reveal that health concerns have led them to pack in Frosties, Cheerios and Special K in favour of options they feel are of better nutritional value.

The amount of women having high-protein breakfasts has more than doubled in the past five years (3 per cent up to 7 per cent).

Almost two thirds (63 per cent) of women used to have cereal for breakfast five years ago, now just two in five (42 per cent) do.

The results from their survey of 2,000 people reflects recent statistics that show cereal brands are continuing to struggle. 

An increasing number of women are even opting for protein supplement-based breakfast products as convenient on-the-go meals.

Sales of products such as protein pancakes, shakes and even protein coffee are up 46 per cent since February at sports nutrition company Bodybuilding Warehouse, and it's women who are driving the change.

The amount of women taking protein snacks and supplements has almost tripled in the past year (6 per cent up to 17 per cent), as opposed to a smaller increase of a quarter in men (25 per cent to 31 per cent).  

A spokesperson says: 'These statistics about more and more women taking protein snacks and supplements aren't surprising. Often cereals are empty calories and don’t offer much by way of nutrition at all.

'People are exercising more control over what they put into their bodies and, with even some cereals containing more sugar than a doughnut, understandably people are looking for alternatives.

'We've seen huge growth in the popularity of protein products being used as an alternative breakfast. 

'This is often used alongside a morning workout or as part of a general fitness regime. 

'They provide a satisfying, filling and tasty alternative to traditional breakfasts, with the added benefit of being part of a healthy lifestyle for those who exercise regularly. 

Bodybuilding Warehouse has responded to demand by taking popular breakfast items and redeveloping them into healthier options with reduced sugar and fat. 

'Having a protein-filled breakfast in the morning is great because it fills you up for longer and means you will eat less throughout the day,' continues their spokesperson.

'This is ideal if you’re on a diet or healthy eating plan. However, whilst high-protein breakfasts offer a number of benefits, you need to be careful to choose options that aren't too high in "bad" fats. 

Cereal isn't all bad though - dietitian Nichola Whitehead who runs the website nicsnutrition.com believes that certain types of grain are just as nutritious as a protein-packed meal, it just depends on the ingredients.

She said: 'If anyone ever asks me ‘is this cereal healthy’ the first thing I do is ignore any claims and branding on the front and turn it straight over to the ingredients list.. if sugar is near the top then I’d probably suggest picking another. 

'The good news is though that most cereals are fortified with nutrients such a iron and folic acid meaning that a bowl of cereal beats a greasy-spoon takeaway any day.' 

'But having eggs for breakfast has been shown to reduce feelings of hunger later in the day, and all protein sources including milk, greek yoghurt, salmon and whey protein will contribute to our daily protein needs. 

'People who work-out or who are trying to lose weight and preserve their lean muscle mass may need more than the recommended 0.8g of protein per Kg of body weight a day, and so including protein at breakfast is a great start to the day.'

Tenderstem bubble & squeak with bacon and eggs

Tenderstem bubble & squeak with bacon and eggs

Ingredients (serves 4)

1 kg potatoes, peeled & cut into equal chunks

50g butter

2 tbsp olive or rapeseed oil

2 onions, chopped

150g smoked lardons, or chopped streaky bacon

240g Tenderstem, cut into bite sized pieces

Salt & freshly ground black pepper

2 tbsp olive or rapeseed oil

4 eggs

Method 

Put the potatoes into a pan of lightly salted cold water and bring up to the boil. Cook for about 15-20 minutes until soft when pierced with a fork. Drain well and mash with the butter.

While the potatoes are cooking, heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan and fry the onions over a medium heat for about 20 minutes until lightly caramelised. When they are ready, stir though the mashed potatoes.

Add the lardons or bacon to the frying pan and cook over a medium heat until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain for a moment on kitchen paper, then stir though the potatoes.

Cook the Tenderstem in boiling water for 3 minutes until just tender. Drain a lightly fold through the mash, adding a good seasoning of salt and black pepper.

Using your hands divide the mixture into 8 even sized balls. Flatten into patties, lay on a plate and chill until required.

When you are ready to eat, add a little oil to a frying pan and fry the patties over a medium heat for 3-4 minutes on each side. Remove to a warmed plate whilst you fry an egg per person in the same pan.

Breakfast frittata 

From The Get Lean Recipe Book by personal trainer Jack Braniff

Ingredients

• 3 whole eggs and 3 egg whites

• 75g of chicken, turkey or lean bacon, chopped

• 1 onion, chopped finely

• 1 tomato, sliced thinly

• 50g of crumbled goats cheese or cheddar

• Green vegetable options chose any combination of: Handful of peas, 1 green pepper, de seeded and chopped, a handful of spinach or broccoli, diced

• 1 tbsp of butter or coconut oil

Method 

Heat the butter or coconut oil in an omelette pan. If using raw meat ingredients cook these first. Chicken or turkey should be opaque all the way through with no raw pinkness.

Once you’re happy that the meat is cooked, remove it and add the vegetables, omitting any spinach as this can become overcooked and soggy. Sauté to your liking - they retain more nutrients if they are softened and not over cooked.

Once the vegetables are cooked to your liking return the cooked meat and any other cooked ingredients for your frittata and heat them through.

Beat your eggs with salt and pepper. In the skillet organise the contents to give an even spread of different ingredients then scatter all or some of the cheese across the surface. You may want to reserve some for a cheesy topping.

Add any spinach you are using. Pour the beaten egg over the surface of the cheesy vegetables.

On medium heat, cook the frittata for about two minutes, scraping the sides and bottom with heat-resistant spatula and lifting the vegetables to let the egg down to the bottom of the pan. When eggs are mostly cooked, but still wet, stop stirring. You want to see cooked egg scattered throughout, but loose egg in between. Continue cooking on the stove for another minute.

Sprinkle the rest of the cheese on top, put the pan under the grill and cook the top until the cheese is hot and melted. Allow to stand for a minute. Cut into wedges and serve.
