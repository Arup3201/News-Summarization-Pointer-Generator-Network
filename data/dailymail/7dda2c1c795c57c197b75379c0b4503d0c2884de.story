A man was gunned down today in a drive-by shooting in front of terrified lunchtime shoppers on a busy London street.

Stunned onlookers watched police with automatic weapons ‘running through the streets’ of Islington, north London, a few moments after a man was shot in the back by a gunman on a moped.

Police say the 23-year-old victim suffered ‘life changing injuries’ after being gunned down near the junction of Essex Road and Cross Street just before 1pm. He was tonight being treated in hospital.

A witness, a teacher who gave her name as Delores, 36, said: ‘I walked past and there was a boy standing on the corner and the police officers approached him gently.

'One of the officers put his hand on the boy’s shoulder and they took off his jacket, he was obviously very scared. There was a massive bleeding hole in his back'

Previous incident: It comes four days after a teenager's hand was 'almost severed' after another youth attacked him with a machete outside a restaurant in the same area last Thursday

‘A moped came along, the driver pulled a gun on somebody, shot them in the back and drove off. We didn’t hear anything, we were busy working away. They closed the road off, I don’t know how we’re going to get home.’

It comes four days after a teenager's hand was 'almost severed' after another youth attacked him with a machete outside a restaurant in the same area last Thursday.

Restaurant staff rushed to help the 18-year-old, who also had a knife, as blood poured from his wrist, splattering the pavement on Upper Street in Islington.

Another youth, said to be in his late teens, was stabbed in the arm and both were taken to hospital suffering from what police said were 'non-life threatening' injuries.

They were later both arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. There is no suggestion that the events today and last Thursday were linked.
