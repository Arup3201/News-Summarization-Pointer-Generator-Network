The three ‘Jihadi brides’ stole family jewellery to pay for their flights out of the UK, it was revealed yesterday.

Police have discovered they paid the £1,000 cost of their flights from Gatwick airport to Istanbul in cash.

Before they went missing, the girls are believed to have communicated with 20-year-old Aqsa Mahmood, a notorious jihadi who left Glasgow last year.

The former medical student has become the online contact of choice for those wanting to travel to Syria and marry a militant fighter.

One of the girls, Shamima Begum, used her Twitter account to try to contact her directly, asking for her to open a private line of communication.

Friends suspect the girls were in touch with Mahmood and Islamic State recruiters via their mobile phones in the weeks before Christmas.

Investigators are also examining whether the trio managed to exchange messages with their 15-year-old friend after she disappeared on December 6. 

Police revealed yesterday that two women, aged 20 and 21, have been arrested in North London over the latter’s disappearance.

The suspects were held on suspicion of an offence under the Child Abduction Act and will answer bail next month.

Mark Rowley, who has overall responsibility for police counter terrorism, said the three girls would not be arrested for terrorist offences if they returned to the UK.

‘We have no evidence in this case that any of the three girls are responsible for any terrorist offences,’ he said.

The girls were pictured going through security at Gatwick Airport last month, dressed in Western clothes.

They were later seen on CCTV in Turkey, dressed in burkas and waiting for a bus to take them to the border with Syria.

They are now believed to be in Raqqa, Islamic State’s stronghold and scene of some of its most barbaric atrocities.

In an unfortunate turn of events, the Met had a counter terrorism officer based in Turkey but he was on annual leave when the girls touched down.

At least 22 young women, the vast majority under the age of 20, are feared to have travelled to Syria from the UK over the past 12 months.

Police said the total confirmed number of people travelling to fight is now around 700, with many more suspected of flying out undetected.

Last night, the girls’ families insisted that someone else helped them with the cost of the air tickets as the missing jewellery was not worth £1,000.

Halima Khanom, sister of Kadiza Sultana, said: ‘My sister used to borrow a piece of jewellery off my daughters that was very sentimental to her and that’s what she’s taken.

‘I feel there is someone out there helping in terms of funding because there’s no way my sister has got the cash to fund herself.’

The jihadi girls’ shopping list has been found and it included details of prices for flights to Turkey, visa money, coaches, hotels, taxis and other supplies.

Among items they were advised to bring were a £50 epilator, two sets of £12 underwear, socks for £4 and a phone for £75. 

Next to each item was as set of initials, appearing to show either who was to purchase them or who they were for.

The list included tips as to how to cross over the Turkish border and into IS-held territory, written in different handwriting at the bottom of the page.

The total cost of the items, which includes £1,000 plane tickets to Turkey, came to £2,190.
