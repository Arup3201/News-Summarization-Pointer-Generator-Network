In today’s tough job market, many are forced to take desperate measures to get noticed by employers.

But one group on unemployed Danes are taking ‘putting yourself out there’ to another level, by spending their days on display in a shop window.

The display, called ‘Exhibited: Too clever to sit in a window?’ allows 15 job seekers to take a seat in a shopfront on a busy Copenhagen in the hopes that potential employers will walk by.

Window seat: One of the 15 unemployed academics have taken his place in the window for project 'Exhibit? Too clever to sit in a window?'

Thanks to a low public debt and 
remaining outside the Eurozone, Denmark has been shielded from much of 
the economic turmoil blighting the rest of Europe.

But despite this qualified professionals are still finding it tough to get a job and opportunities for academics are sparse.

Danish marketing firm Reputation 
Copenhagen came up with ingenious way of helping 15 unemployed and 
top-educated men and women get noticed and built an office display in 
the window of its headquarters, located in the Danish capital’s business
district.

The unemployed range from former CEOs 
to lawyers, economists and a ballerina and will each be given slots to 
spend their time in the window as they please to get potential employers to double-take.

Showcase: The project involves 15 unemployed men and women who are given free reins to use the window for presentations or as a work space in the hopes an employer walks by

They can put on a presentation, performance, or simply use the time to work at the provided desk as people walk by.

'I am sitting here like a monkey in a 
cage,' Hannibal Camel Holt, an unemployed political scientist describes 
the experience as ‘a monkey in a cage’ as he takes his space in the 
window.

Despite a long CV of qualifications 
and experience - as well as speaking six languages - Mr Holt has been 
unemployed on and off for four years and hopes for further success 
following his two predecessors.

Both Lene Damgaard Jørgensen and Christel Werenskiold who were the first to take the window seat have been hired.

Success: The signs placed on the desk reads 'Has been given a job' after the two first partakers were given a job during their week in the window
