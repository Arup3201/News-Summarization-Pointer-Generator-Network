Disgraced senator John Edwards today denied allegations he had any involvement with one of the high-class hookers working for alleged Manhattan Madam Anna Gristina after it was claimed he paid for sex while in New York during his presidential bid in 2007.

Edwards is the first high-profile name to come out of Gristina's alleged black book of clients after he was identified today by the website that originally exposed the prostitution ring scandal.

Anna Gristina, 44, from Monroe County, was arrested on February 23 accused of running a million-dollar brothel empire for the last 15 years for wealthy and powerful clients - who are said to be panicking they may be outed ever since.

Outed: Former senator John Edwards is the first name to be revealed from the Manhattan Madam's 'Black Book' of clients who allegedly had sexual trysts with her high-class hookers

In the dock: Alleged madam Anna Gristina said she would rather bite off her tongue than name any names

The former senator's attorney 
released a statement on behalf of his client today saying: 'Mr Edwards 
categorically denies that he was involved with any prostitute or any 
such service. These allegations are false and defamatory and will put 
those who publish or report them on notice that they are acting with 
actual malice by reporting or repeating them.'

He is in the process of demanding a complete retraction from DNAInfo, who first reported the accusations.

Sources claimed to the website that the former senator spent one night with the call girl while he was in New York raising money for his campaign, before his shameful and public fall from grace after his affair with videographer Rielle Hunter was exposed.

It is the latest in a long line of scandals to hit the 58-year-old since his extra-marital affair and subsequent love child were discovered.

When the National Enquirer broke the story about the affair, Edwards released a similar denial calling the claims 'false, completely untrue and ridiculous'.

Front: During his campaign, Edwards portrayed himself as a devoted family man, right, while Anna Gristina has presented herself as a soccer mom and animal lover who lives a quiet life with her husband, right

The prostitute is said to have given 
investigators a detailed account of her alleged tryst with Edwards in 
2008 after the Manhattan's DA office were first tipped off about 
Gristina's prostitution ring.

February 22 - Anna Gristina is arrested while meeting with a Morgan Stanley banker allegedly regarding an online prostitution service

March 7 - Morgan Stanley banker David Walker suspended from work pending investigation

March 8 - Sources claim Eliot Spitzer tipped off Gristina in 2005 during prostitution sting. 'Madam' makes second appearance in court and is denied bail again

March 10 - Former NYPD cop Sly Francis outed as alleged madam's former bodyguard 

March 12 - Gristina in court again as attorney puts up $2.5million loft as collateral. Bail denied for third time

March 13 - Jaynie Mae Baker finally turns herself in, appears in court and released on $100k bond

March 16 - The arrests of three more people revealed, including two high-class call girls - Mhairiangelo Bottone and Catherine DeVries - and Jonas Gayer, who is accused of helping Gristina launder money

March 22 - John Edwards named as alleged client

The source claimed: 'Most of the women don’t have any idea 
about the identities of the men they sleep with. How would they know a money man from Wall Street or the face of a 
lawyer or banker who shows up?

'But the face of the national politician? She knew.'

An aide of the former Democratic presidential hopeful familiar with Gristina's operation allegedly organised the fling, which is claimed to have taken place at an Upper East Side hotel rather than the alleged brothel.

During his trips to the city, Edwards usually stayed at the plush Loews Hotels Regency - on the Upper East Side -  the same hotel he met Rielle Hunter.

The 58-year-old is currently waiting to face federal trial in 
North Carolina, which has been postponed until March 26 due to a serious heart 
condition he is said to be suffering from.

He is accused of
 using nearly $1million in campaign donations to cover up his affair and
 love child with Hunter during his 2008 run for president while his wife was battling with cancer.

Each of the six counts he is charged with carries a maximum five-year prison term and $250,000 fine. 

At the time the hooker was 
questioned, investigators allegedly found her to be a 'credible witness' but they did not
 see a reason to notify the feds during a time when Edwards' campaign 
trail was at its peak and he was seen as a family man with a squeaky-clean image, according to the source.

They confirmed he was in New York raising money at the time of the alleged encounter.

Base: During his campaign trail, Edwards often stayed at the Loews Hotels Regency in Manhattan's Upper East Side - the same area of New York the call girl alleged she had a fling with Edwards

New York: The madam's alleged brothel was also in the Upper East Side of the city but a far cry from the plush surroundings enjoyed at the Loews Hotels Regency

When she was interviewed in Rikers Island prison, where she is being held on $2million bond, Gristina said she would rather bite her own tongue off than tell authorities anything, after they presented her with a list of ten names.

Secrets: During his campaign trail, Edwards had an affair with videographer Rielle Hunter and they have a child together

A judge has three times refused her bail as she is considered a high-flight risk. It is believed that because she has a British passport and a home in Canada, she would flee the country with the help of wealthy clients who are trying everything to avoid their names being leaked.

Sources told DNAinfo that the Millionaire Madam’s 'black book' of clients included, a Middle Eastern sheik, an international 
billionaire financier, a nightclub impresario, dozens of Wall Street 
hedge fund and investment bankers, and a network of lawyers.

Gristina, a suburban soccer mom who moved to New York 20 years ago from her native Edinburgh, was arrested after a five-year investigation during which undercover police taped more than 100 hours of audio where she bragged about her high-end clients, how she had contacts in law enforcement who would tip her off and even how she used underage girls for some of the trysts, according to explosive court documents.

The divorcee lives in suburban Monroe, north of New York City, with her children and a number of rescue animals.

The five-year-long investigation was run by a Manhattan district attorney's office unit that pursues cases against police and other uniformed city workers, according to a transcript of her February 23 arraignment.

During hundreds of hours of 
surveillance, Gristina was heard saying that 'she has connections in law
 enforcement who are poised to help her out, to let her know if there is
 trouble on the front that she needs to be concerned about', District 
Attorney Charles Linehan said, according to the court transcript.

Neighbours
 say a steady stream of young women - usually of Eastern European 
descent - would come and go from the second-floor apartment, as did a 
number of suited business men.

In the weeks after Gristina was arrested, Eliot Spitzer was accused of tipping the madam off in 2005 about a crackdown on impending brothels in the city. He was also accused of being a client.

Kristin Davis, who ran a Manhattan call-girl service used by the disgraced former governor, said she shared a booker with Gristina who told her about Spitzer's alleged warning.

It was said to have prompted her to shut down her agency Fleur d' Elite and skip the country.

Also arrested was Jaynie Mae Baker, 
said to have been an accomplice of Gristina's, who allegedly found 
wealthy clients to pair with the high-class hookers.

The 30-year-old, from Brooklyn, was on the run for three weeks before handing herself into police.

Alleged accomplice: Jaynie Mae Baker, 30, 
appeared in court after three weeks on the run, with her attorney Robert Gottlieb, left, on a 
single charge of promoting prostitution

Humiliation: Former New York Governor Eliot 
Spitzer is another high-profile client who has been named in connection with Anna Gristina's alleged prostitution business

Charged with a single count of prostitution, she hired high-powered criminal defense attorney Robert Gottlieb, who said his client was vacationing in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, when news of the case broke last week and was not in fact 'on the run'.

Accused of helping run the soccer-mom-turned-Manhattan-Madam's alleged millionaires-only call girl ring, but was using a legitimate dating service as a cover, she was charged with a single count of prostitution and plead not guilty.

Last week, it was also revealed that three other arrests had made so far in connection with the case including two alleged high-class hookers and a man accused of helping Gristina to launder money to offshore accounts.

The three arrests happened weeks ago - in one case, more than a year ago - but they became the latest sign of the scope of the case after the New York Post reported them on Friday.

The two women charged with prostitution, Mhairiangelo Bottone and Catherine DeVries, pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor charge.

The man accused of laundering money, named Jonas Gayer but identified in court papers only as John Doe, has been facing charges for two years or more, according to court records.
