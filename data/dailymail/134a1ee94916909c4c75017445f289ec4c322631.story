A well-known beauty editor has been accused of staging a 'full on' tantrum at a Manolo Blahnik sample sale after spotting some of her fellow attendees trying to cut the line at the VIP event.

According to a witness at the sale, which took place at the Warwick Hotel in Midtown, New York, yesterday, Women's Wear Daily beauty editor Julie Naughton 'freaked out that people who had just walked in were getting queued up before her' and began lashing out at guests.

'She was screaming: "I hope these people don’t ever want to work in publishing",' the source told Page Six. 'And then [she] started trash-talking... She was being such a terrible bully.'

The Page Six witness claims that Ms Naughton said of one attendee: 'She looks like she’s from Long Island and her Chanel bag is fake.' 

The one-day Manolo sample sale is renowned among fashion lovers as one of the hottest tickets in town thanks to its impressive discounts and wide variety of stock. Luxury high heels which usually retail for more than $1,000 a pair are available at the sale for a fraction of the price, with some shoes going for as little as $100. 

VIPs and fashion editors were invited to attend an early preview of the event, which began at 9am, two hours before the general public were given access. 

According to a spokesperson for WWD, Ms Naughton arrived promptly at the hotel at 6.30am in order to secure her place in the queue and was merely 'defending' her space when she noticed that some people were trying to cut in. 

'It was a crowded sample sale, and there were several line crashers,' the spokesperson told Page Six. 

'Words were exchanged, but she was standing her ground, as she arrived earlier. She was defending her, and everyone else’s, place in line.'

'The characterization of this exchange is inaccurate and unfair,' a spokesperson added to MailOnline. 'Julie was defending her place in line as latecomers tried to jump ahead of others who had been patiently waiting their turn. 

'We know sample sales of this kind are intense and if a snarky comment or two was exchanged…well, this is fashion after all…'

While notable, Ms Naughton's tantrum was not the only incident which is reported to have taken place at the event. According to reports, a luxury handbag, which had been on display at the event, was stolen.

It was also claimed that staff refused to open the windows for fear that would-be thieves might use the opportunity to throw shoes out of the building and into the arms of a waiting accomplice.
