A judge has ordered the suspension of the globally popular instant messaging system WhatsApp across Brazil.

He said it's because it has allegedly failed to help in an investigation and though he wouldn't comment on details because it's an on-going case, it's believed to be one that's looking into child porn appearing on the app.

Judge Luiz de Moura Correia ordered the suspension earlier this month. A press officer at the Piaui state's Public Safety Department says the case is linked to 'sexually graphic photos of children on the app.'

The service has continued to operate normally, with newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reporting that this is because lawyers are appealing the ruling.

WhatsApp does not have an office in Brazil so the judge's order was delivered to cellphone operators.

SindiTelebrasil, the association that represents those operators, said on its website that the suspension could cause 'huge losses to millions of Brazilians' who use WhatsApp for personal and professional reasons.

WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

WhatsApp is owned by Facebook, which last year paid nearly $22billion to acquire the mobile messaging service.

Earlier this year Prime Minister David Cameron threatened to block WhatsApp to prevent terrorists from plotting atrocities online.

In a challenge to critics of the so-called snoopers’ charter, he said fanatics should not be able to talk to each other without security agencies listening in.

Making an electoral campaign speech in Nottingham in January, Mr Cameron indicated he would revive monitoring legislation – blocked by the Liberal Democrats – if he secures a majority in May.

‘The attacks in Paris once again demonstrated the need to have robust powers through our intelligence and security agencies to keep our people safe,’ he said.

‘The powers that I believe we need, whether on communications data or on the content of communications, I am very comfortable that those are absolutely right for a modern, liberal democracy.

‘If I am Prime Minister, I will make sure we do not allow terrorists safe space to communicate with each other.’

The Prime Minister also added that he would stop the use of methods of communication, which cannot be read by the security services such as WhatsApp and Snapchat, due to data being encrypted.

He explained: 'Are we going to allow a means of communications which it simply isn’t possible to read?

'My answer to that question is: ‘No, we must not.'
