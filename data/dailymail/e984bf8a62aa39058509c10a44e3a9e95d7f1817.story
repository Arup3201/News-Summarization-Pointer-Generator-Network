It’s hardly the most auspicious time for Schalke to be travelling to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea after all are the swashbuckling, free-scoring darlings of Europe at present, spearheaded by Diego Costa, whose extraordinary start in England has already seen him score two hat-tricks and seven goals in four games.

Meanwhile, last weekend in the Bundesliga, Schalke lost 4-1 to Borussia Monchengladbach, with striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar admitting ‘they could have scored ten.’ 

So things would have been bad enough in normal circumstances, given that manager Jens Keller’s job is in the balance, with former Mainz manager Thomas Tuchel, the latest young, hipster German, poised to take over if a poor start to the season continues.

Worse, though, Benedickt Howedes, the German World Cup winner and mainstay of the defence, ripped his groin in that match and misses Wednesday night's game, meaning Schalke now have an entire back four out through injury and face the prospect of having to field a centre-half partnership with a combined age of 37 in Kaan Ayhan and Marvin Friedrich. The latter, 18, only made his debut at the weekend as a substitute.

Centre-halves Josip Matip, Felipe Santana and full backs Atsuto Uchida and Sead Kolasinac are all out as well as Howedes, meaning Keller is left to fight for his future against one of the most-fearsome attacks in Europe with a make-shift defence.

Even at near full strength Schalke struggled against Chelsea last season, losing 3-0 home and away. They have never scored against Chelsea in four previous matches and have conceded eight goals.

All of which suggests it could be something of a goal-fest for Chelsea. And though circumstances may dictate that Eden Hazard, Oscar, Willian and Costa could have an enjoyable evening’s work given the rawness of their defensive opponents, there is a broader point to be made about Chelsea's direction of travel.

There has been plenty of scepticism about the dichotomy between Roman Abramovich’s desire for sexy football and Jose Mourinho's instinctive need to defend a result. At times the tension between the two competing philosophies has threatened to tear the club apart, as it did seven years ago this week.

Cast your minds back to a desperately uninspiring 1-1 draw with Rosenborg in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge in September 2007. Two days later Mourinho was sacked, Abramovich seemingly no longer content with results-focused football.

Caricature Mourinho like this and he invariably bristles and points you to Real Madrid record-breaking season of 121 goals under his stewardship in 2011-12. Yet there is undoubtedly a safety-first instinct in Mourinho that is missing in his tactical adversaries such as Pep Guardiola and the Johan Cruyff school or among the next generation of innovators, such as Jurgen Klopp.

Jose Mourinho appears to have found the perfect balance between attack and defence at Chelsea this season

Roman Abramovich will be very satisfied by the start Chelsea have made to the season

Loic Remy also opened his account for Chelsea in the 4-2 win over Swansea City at the weekend 

It was evident as recently as last year’s Champions League semi-finals against Atletico Madrid, where caution in the first leg and a failure to react to Atletico’s aggressive attacking football in the second half of the second leg cost Chelsea.

Yet in this line up, with Costa up front, a trio of playmakers behind him and with Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas – or Ramires – holding in midfield there does seem to be formidable goal-scoring potential which for the first time in years is properly balanced in midfield.

Of course there is a grave danger in hailing teams on the basis of fine performances in the late summer. Roberto di Matteo’s Chelsea looked good initially. 

The real test will come when they are not playing against a rookie defence and some truly world-class attacks test what might well be a shaky back four. Certainly Everton and Swansea found Chelsea easy enough to breach and even Leicester and Burnley had their chances.

But for now Mourinho seems to have found the right formula and tonight surely there will be much to enjoy in Chelsea’s football?
