The cat. In the bathroom. On the officer's shoulders?

Nope, not a game of Clue. But police say one orange tabby wanted to be closely involved when officers responding to a burglary report searched the cat's home in southeast Portland.

Sgt. Pete Simpson says police were called Monday afternoon when a woman returned home from work to find her house burglarized.

When police entered the home to search for a suspect, Officer Sarah Kerwin noted broken glass on the floors of the basement and a bathroom.

Because the resident cat was walking around on the floor, the officer picked up the cat to make sure it didn't step in the glass.

The cat happily climbed onto Kerwin's shoulders and stayed there as police finished searching the house.

No burglar was found.

KATU.com reports that a neighbor told police that she spotted a suspicious man in the neighborhood earlier that day.

He is described as being a white man in his 30s with a skinny build and measuring around 5-foot-9 inches tall.

Another neighbor told police that they saw a suspicious man driving a white van around the Portland neighborhood.

Anyone with information about the burglary can report it to police at 503-823-3333.
