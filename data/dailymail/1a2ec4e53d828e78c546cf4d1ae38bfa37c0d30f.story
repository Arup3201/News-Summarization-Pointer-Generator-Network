Aptamil is investigating a complaint that some of its baby milk might be linked to an 11-week-old boy getting food poisoning.

Laura Stevens found 50p-sized blood spots in her son Roman's nappy and took him to the doctors.

He was sent to hospital where he remained for a week with constant diarrhoea and a temperature. Doctors said he had a campylobacter infection but could not give a source.

Miss Stevens, a first-time mum, said the only food she had given her son was Aptamil milk powder - but the company's initial quality checks have come back clear.

The 30-year-old, from Swindon, Wiltshire, said: 'Roman's tests came back and showed he had food poisoning.

'I was gobsmacked, his insides had swollen from the food poisoning and the blood was the bacteria trying to get out of his little body.'

The insurance worker said Roman was left lethargic and pale while he was in hospital. The strain of bacteria is commonly found in meat and poultry.

While Aptamil is investigating she has stopped giving Roman the product and switched to a different milk product.

Miss Stevens, who lives with Roman's dad Luke Embling, also 30, added: 'As a first-time mum, I started panicking when I saw the fresh blood, it didn't stop for nearly a week and the diarrhoea was constant.

'I was terrified he was bleeding internally or I'd done something wrong in pregnancy. I didn't know what to do.'

Aptamil confirmed it is investigating and said it had not had any other complaints.

A spokesman said: 'We are aware of this complaint and are concerned to hear that Roman had been unwell.

'We have been in contact with her and are pleased that he is recovering.

'All our milks are manufactured to stringent quality standards including high temperature processing and a number of quality tests before they are released for sale.

'We have checked our production records and know that all of the quality checks were carried out. We have not received any other similar complaints.

'We are happy to help with any independent investigation but have not yet been contacted.'

Public Health England said it had not been asked to investigate but were aware of a confirmed case of campylobacter in a young child in the Swindon area.

A spokesman said: 'Most infections are sporadic and it is difficult to trace it back to the exact source.

'Microbiological testing would have to be carried out to confirm it was the same strain that linked the patient and the implicated food.

'Without this, there is no way of confirming an association to a particular product.'
