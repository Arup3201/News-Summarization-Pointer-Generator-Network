AC Milan missed the chance to go third in Serie A as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Fiorentina at the San Siro.

Nigel de Jong headed the Rossoneri into a 25th-minute lead, but second-half substitute Josip Ilicic fired La Viola level.

Two dropped points meant Filippo Inzaghi’s side had to be content with sixth place, a point behind third-spotted Udinese, with the visitors down in 11th.
