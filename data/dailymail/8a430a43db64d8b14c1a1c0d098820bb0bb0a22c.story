Amid a swirl of diplomatic maneuvering, President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met at the White House on Monday to evaluate the prospects of reviving an elusive peace plan to end the conflict between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists.

Hanging over the discussions was a potential split between Obama and Merkel on sending Ukraine defensive weapons to wage a more effective fight against the rebels.

The White House has said Obama is reconsidering his opposition to arming Ukraine given a recent surge in violence, while Merkel has adamantly opposed such steps.

Obama said Monday that a 'decision has not yet been made' as to whether the U.S. would provide Ukraine with lethal, defensive weapons and that he continues to hope that diplomacy will prevail.

The U.S. and Europe have largely been in lockstep in their response to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, raising the prospect that the public divide on lethal aid was merely a tactic to push Russian President Vladimir Putin to accept a peace plan. 

Merkel and Obama stressed on Monday at their joint press conference that their countries were united on the issue of Russian aggression.

The U.S. President said that even though his country and the European countries it is aligned with may disagree tactically on how to approach Russia if peace talks fail, they are 'completely unified' on the broader issue.

'We stand up for the same principles of inviolability of territorial integrity,' Merkel said in her remarks, according to the White House's translation.

The German Chancellor admitted that the coalition working to secure a peace agreement with Russia has 'suffered a lot of setbacks' but said she still sees no military solution to the situation in Ukraine.

'We have to put all our efforts in bringing about a diplomatic solution,' she said.

Obama said he too favors peace talks and hopes sanctions will weaken Russia enough to bring Putin to the table.

But if diplomacy fails, Obama said, the U.S. will look at all available options, including lethal weapons. 

After a German reporter referred to him as 'Nobel Laureate Obama,' per a translation, and asked where is 'red line' is on the issue, Obama refused to provide a specific timeline and said a decision would come about as part of an 'ongoing analysis' of Russia's encroachment on Ukraine.

He later said of the decision before him, 'The measure by which I make these decisions is: "Is it more likely to be effective than not?" And that is what our deliberations will be about.'

'We are not looking for Russia to fail. We are not looking for Russia to be surrounded and contained and weakened.' Obama explained. 

The United States' preference, he said, is for a 'strong, prosperous, vibrant, confident Russia that can be a partner with us.' 'Unfortunately,' he said, Russia made a decision that is not only 'bad for them strategically' but bad for Europe and for the world.

'In the face of this aggression and these bad decisions, we can't simply try to talk them out of it,' Obama continued. 'We have to show them that the world is unified in imposing a cost for this aggression.

'And that's what we're going to continue to do,' he added.

Over the next few weeks, the US soldiers will conduct training as part of so-called 'Stryker Detachment', and then from March 12 will take part in the exercises with 1st motorized infantry battalion of the Polish 12th Mechanised Brigade

Merkel and French President Francois Hollande met with Putin and Ukrainian leaders last week and announced a new summit meeting for Wednesday in Minsk.

The United States will not be at the table when French and German leaders meet with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Putin in an attempt to breathe life into a much-violated September peace plan. 

Merkel said Monday, however, that her country has been in 'very, very close contact' with the U.S on sanctions and they have been in 'very close cooperation, very close coordination.' 

She told reporters that she and Hollande were looking to bring about a ceasefire with talks and at least create conditions in which civilians not dying.

'I myself would not be able to live with not having made this attempt,' she said of this week's meeting.

If a point in time comes in which it becomes clear that 'success is not possible,' however, then the United States and Europe will have to come together and discuss next steps, she noted.

The European Union decided Monday to temporarily hold off on slapping more sanctions on Russians and Ukrainian separatists while awaiting the outcome of the peace talks.

'The principle of the sanctions is maintained but the application will depend on what happens on the ground,' French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said during a break in talks with EU foreign ministers in Brussels.

The meeting in the Belarusian capital takes place with Merkel and Hollande deeply opposed to arming Ukraine in its bid to push back the separatists that NATO and the United States insist are being armed by Russia, which also has troops fighting in the eastern Ukraine.  

Opponents of arming Kiev believe that could open a proxy war between Washington and Moscow. Merkel and Hollande insist the only way to end the conflict is through diplomacy.

'It must be possible to find — not through military conflict but at the negotiating table — a balance of interests inside Ukraine that guarantees both the integrity of the state and the appropriate scale of autonomy' for the separatists, said German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen.

Secretary of State John Kerry, on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, said that he, too, was working for a diplomatic solution but was ambiguous on arms for Kiev.

'I have no doubt that additional assistance of economic kind and other kinds will be going to Ukraine. And we do so understanding that there is no military solution,' he said. 'The solution is a political, diplomatic one. 

'But President Putin's got to make the decision to take an off ramp. And we have to make it clear to him that we are absolutely committed to the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine no matter what,' Kerry said in response to a direct question about sending arms.

At the Munich Security Conference over the weekend, Vice President Joe Biden had stopped short of explicitly addressing possible arms deliveries.

'We will continue to provide Ukraine with security assistance not to encourage war, but to allow Ukraine to defend itself,' he said.

Meanwhile, Democratic and Republican members of Congress on the House of Representatives' Armed Services Committee were said Monday to be creating legislation that provides for 'defensive lethal assistance' for Ukraine.

A congressional aide told Reuters that the committee's chairman and ranking member were 'far along in discussions' on the issue.

Both chambers of the legislative branch unanimously passed legislation in December authorizing an arms shipment to Ukraine and Obama gave the bill his approval. The legislation gave him the authority when to send weapons, however, and some members of Congress are agitated that he's not yet acted.

'The Ukrainian people do not have time for President Obama’s “strategic patience," ' South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Monday after Obama and Merkel's press conference, taking aim at a term used by the administration in a document outlining the principles that will guide the president's foreign policy decisions during his remaining two years in office.

'It is time for President Obama to quit equivocating and quickly provide Ukraine the defensive weapons it needs,' he said.

Graham, a Republican who has announced that he's considering a presidential bid, said 'Obama’s continual weakness in the face of aggression is making the world a more dangerous place.'

'His reluctance to provide defensive weapons – which Ukraine desperately needs to protect themselves against Russian intervention – is another low point in a presidency which has many to choose from,' Graham charged. 

The current situation 'once again shows that under President Obama’s leadership it is better to be America’s enemy than her friend,' he continued. 'It’s a sad fact that our enemies are seldom challenged while our friends are constantly undercut and abandoned.'

More than 5,300 people have been killed since fighting began in April, according to a U.N. tally, and the bloodshed has markedly increased over the past two weeks.

On Monday, a powerful explosion rocked a chemical plant and set it on fire outside the separatist stronghold of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Rebels said the plant was hit by government shelling.
