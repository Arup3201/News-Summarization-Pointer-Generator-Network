An afternoon drive down to the coast may be a relaxing way to pass the time, but if you get too close to the tide it can get messy very quickly.

One driver paid a hefty price for some slightly wayward parking when his car was swept into the Bristol Channel during high tide in Mumbles, Swansea yesterday.

Worse still for the male driver, coastguard crews have since been unable to recover his silver Vauxhall Corsa and say it could be floating 'anywhere in the Bristol Channel.'

All at sea: The headlights of the submerged Vauxhall Corsa can be seen beneath the waters off the Mumbles, Swansea. The car became stuck in sand after heading down a slipway

The man and his wife managed to get out of the car long before it became submerged on the slipway to the water's edge on Monday afternoon. However, despite a two-hour attempt emergency services were unable to recover the hire car.

Now a warning has been issued to vessels in one of Britain's busiest shipping lanes.

Going, going, going: Waters swirl around the Corsa just before it floated away at high tide. Coastguard officials said it could now be 'anywhere along the Bristol Channel'

Officials fear the brand-new vehicle could now have floated all the way to the Devon coast.

A spokesperson for the Maritime Coastguard Agency said a man and his wife who drove down the slipway called the coastguard rescue team when their car became submerged.

The spokesperson said: 'The Martime Coastguard Agency helped the woman from the car when the water was one foot from the front of the car.

'Because the car had been driven on to soft sand it got stuck.'

A spokesperson for Swansea Coastguard added: 'A local recovery service was called out, but they were unable to recover the vehicle.

'We broadcast navigation warnings every four hours, and in that broadcast today we have asked vessels to look out for a silver Vauxhall Corsa.

'It is possible it could be anywhere in the Bristol Channel.

'Police went down to the slipway at 2am on Tuesday and it was nowhere.

'The last time it had been seen it was actually floating away.

'I wouldn't rule it out turning up on the North Devon coast at somewhere like Ilfracombe, or Lynton. Anything is possible with the sea currents.'
