A Scotland Yard officer denied killing newspaper seller Ian Tomlinson at the G20 protests when he appeared in court today charged with manslaughter.

Mr Tomlinson, a homeless 47-year-old, collapsed and died on the fringes of demonstrations in central London on April 1 2009.

Pc Simon Harwood, a father of two, showed no emotion as he stood in the dock at Southwark Crown Court in south London to enter his 'not guilty' plea.

Relatives of Mr Tomlinson gasped from the public gallery as Harwood, 40, denied the allegation against him.

Appearing in the dock wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie, he spoke clearly to confirm his name before he was told:

'You are charged on this indictment with manslaughter, that on April 1 2009, you unlawfully killed Ian Tomlinson.

'How do you plead: guilty or not guilty?'

He answered: 'My Lord, not guilty.'

Mr Tomlinson's wife Julia wiped tears from her eyes, while his stepson Paul King hung his head and muttered 'No'.

Harwood's wife Helen showed no emotion during the 20-minute hearing.

His trial had been fixed to take
place in October 2012, but today, with the leave of Mr Justice Jeremy 
Cooke, it was brought forward to June 13 next year.

For Harwood, defence counsel Patrick 
Gibbs QC said he would be making an application to the trial judge over 
'the possibility of a fair trial in the light of all the media 
coverage'.

Ian Tomlinson was fell to the ground when he got caught up in the crowds at the G20 protests on April 1 2009

Mr Tomlinson had to be helped up from the ground by passers by as the police looked on

He walked a short distance before dropping down on the street and dying

That application is due to be heard at the end of November.

Harwood was granted unconditional bail ahead of next year's trial which is expected to last for five weeks.

The Director of Public Prosecutions charged Harwood over the death after reviewing an inquest jury's unlawful killing verdict.

Jurors ruled he acted illegally, recklessly and dangerously in shoving Mr Tomlinson to the ground.

Pc Harwood used 'excessive and unreasonable' force in hitting Mr 
Tomlinson with a baton, the jury said. Mr Tomlinson posed no threat, 
they added.

Keir Starmer QC said new medical evidence at the inquest and the opinions of experts during the hearing helped change his mind.

The
death became an international controversy after New York businessman 
Christopher La Jaunie handed footage he had taken of a police 
confrontation to the Guardian newspaper.

CCTV
images, police helicopter footage and hand-held video recordings show 
Mr Tomlinson cutting a lonely figure as he staggered away from a police 
cordon after being hit with a baton.

Footage then shows Mr Tomlinson gesturing to police and appearing angry after being sent tumbling to the ground.

He collapsed flat out and died minutes later.

During the inquest, his widow Julia said the death 
devastated her family, adding: 'I remember feeling he was the best thing
that ever happened to me.'

Mr Tomlinson, who was born in Matlock, Derbyshire, was an alcoholic with a series of medical complaints who had slept rough for 20 years.
