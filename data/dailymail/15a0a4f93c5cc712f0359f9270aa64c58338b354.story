An East Pennsylvania high school has outlawed toilet paper from the boys bathrooms - forcing students to check it out of the school's office as and when they need it.

The new rule, intended to cut vandalism at the Mahanoy Area High School, has been criticized by some parents who say students are too embarrassed to publicly ask for tissue.

One mother said she had heard of students leaving school claiming to be sick so they could go home and use the toilet there.

Principal, Thomas Smith, defended the measure at a school meeting on Thursday saying vandals had 'destroyed' toilets over the years blocking them up with toilet paper and sometimes even books.

'We've had serious destruction to our bathrooms for the past two years,' Mr Smith said, according to the Republican Herald of Potsville.

'We have a case pending with the police where a bathroom down by our gymnasium was absolutely destroyed.'

'I'm sure Mr. (Robert) Pastucha (district facilities director) could tell you the times that our toilets have been jammed with toilet paper and other papers.'

'And after we took the toilet tissue out of there, people were throwing books. It was our way to try to curb the destruction in the bathrooms.'

Embarrassed: One parent complained that toilet rules at Mahanoy High School humiliated students. Male students have to check-out paper from the school office and check it back in when they are finished

'I agree that it's a drastic measure,' he added.

Boys have to request the paper from either the school office or the nurse signing it out - and back in again when they have used all they need, the local newspaper reports.

Meanwhile Mr Smith has been doing spot checks on the toilets to ensure nothing is going on against the rules.

'We're not refusing anyone toilet paper,' Mr Smith continued.

'You would sign out and then sign back in. I randomly go in to check if anything is going on. Since we've done that, we've cut down on the destruction.'

Karen Yedsena, a parent at the school of Mahanoy City, complained about the measure at the meeting.

She also pointed out that the school's rule of refusing students permission to going to the toilet any other time than the first five minutes of class was equally draconian.

'We're cutting down on people walking through the hallways for no reason,' Superintendent Joie Green responded according to the report.
