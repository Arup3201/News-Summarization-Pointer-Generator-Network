Roberto Martinez went on the defensive, which is more than could be said for his team on Tuesday night. Or this season, for that matter.

That’s 17 goals shipped in this convoluted calendar of Europa League and domestic football. And a first defeat to Swansea in 21 fixtures, the product of a game skewed almost entirely in favour of the side Martinez used to manage.

Not that he was in the mood to enter into a conversation about numbers. ‘Last year was the club’s record points tally in the Premier League so we can share statistics all you want,’ he said. The look on his face suggested it wasn’t a sincere invitation.

These are trying times for the likeable man at Everton’s helm. They sit 14th in the Premier League, having been beaten 3-2 on their own turf by Crystal Palace at the weekend.

That situation, coupled with the demands and consequences of the Europa League, which Swansea know only too well, necessitated the seven changes Martinez made to his line-up. Less understandable was Martinez’s view of the result, which he said included ‘several positives’.

Among them, he said Tony Hibbert, playing his first game in seven months, looked ‘sharp’. Without labouring a cruel point, the 33-year-old was ripped to shreds by Jefferson Montero, Swansea’s rapid left winger.

As Swansea manager Garry Monk said: ‘Montero was a very good threat in one versus one situations - it was something we targeted when we saw the team-sheets.’

It was Montero who made the first-half opener for Nathan Dyer, before Gylfi Sigurdsson capitalised on some farcical defending after the break and Tim Howard was too easily beaten by Marvin Emnes’s late strike.

‘It is something we need to address,’ Martinez said in reference to Everton’s defending, though he later denied Howard’s confidence is becoming an issue.

‘Certain individuals were very pleasing,’ Martinez said. ‘The night was very positive in some aspects and very disappointing in the result.

‘It was typical cup football once we lost the goal. The scoreline reflects that Swansea were clinical in front of goal and we weren’t.’

But in reality, that was generous to Everton and harsh on Swansea, whose rookie manager Garry Monk freely admits to calling his old boss for advice.

‘It was a good night,’ Monk said. ‘Three goals and a clean sheet – I couldn’t have asked for more. I thought we played well against a very good side. They came here with a full squad.

‘This competition is very important to the team, the crowd and the club.’ 

Indeed, a replica of the trophy they won sits in the foyer of this stadium, but Monk’s selection hinted that the Premier League remains an inhibiting concern, with five changes to the side that lost here against Southampton on Saturday.

Initially, that looked a gamble. Everton’s Bryan Oviedo, playing his first game since a horrible double fracture of his left leg in January, won an early free-kick that could, with luck, have proved decisive.

Luke Garbutt took the kick and Antolin Alcaraz shook off Ashley Williams a little too easily. It left Alcaraz five yards from goal with a free swing, but stand-in goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel managed to block.

Hibbert had earlier wasted a golden chance after more lax Swansea defending, slicing over from inside the area. Sadly for Hibbert, that was the highlight.

He was equalling Everton’s club record for an outfield player by appearing in his 15th season, but he was shown up by Montero in the moments immediately preceding Dyer’s 29th-minute opener.

The Ecuadorian left winger went outside and then in before squaring across the six-yard box for Dyer, who finished at the far post. Dyer was on the pitch for less than an hour against Southampton, when Roy Hodgson saw one of his lesser displays, so this was a fine response. Montero looks a potential snip at £4m.

Everton responded by bring Romelu Lukaku on at half-time for Samuel Eto’o and within a minute he had found space and rocketed a shot marginally over the bar. Aiden McGeady then did likewise.

That was as close as Everton came and they were two down after 64 minutes.

Tom Carroll played in Jonjo Shelvey, who hit a hopeful cross into the area. Under little pressure, Sylvain Distin misread the bounce and headed against his own bar. Sigurdsson buried the rebound from close range.

‘The second goal was a bad decision, if you want,’ Martinez said. ‘Luck plays a part - it bounces to the striker.’

Emnes wrapped it up after 87 minutes, his low shot going past Howard without much bother.

‘We kept 15 clean sheets last season,’ Martinez added. But that was then.
