Hugo Lloris has revealed how the France players used footballs as missiles in an attempt to knock the drone that flew over their training ground last week from the sky.

Speaking after the French opened their World Cup campaign with an impressive 3-0 win over an over-physical Honduras, the France captain spoke of this extraordinary incident that brought one of their training sessions to a halt. 

‘It’s a good invention,’ Lloris said with a smile. ‘It looked like a little helicopter. Very small and it flew well. It’s a good object for journalists, yes?VIDEO: Scroll down for France fans in Sao Paulo enjoy 3-0 World Cup win over Honduras

Missiles: The drone flew over their training ground during a session last week

‘We heard it and then we saw it. We didn’t see anyone controlling. Maybe they were behind the stand or the hotel. But there was nothing we could do to stop it – maybe kick the ball at it. But it’s a big challenge to hit it.’

On Saturday Didier Deschamps said the matter – something the France coach described as an invasion of their privacy – was now being investigated by FIFA. Curiously, a FIFA spokesperson has said they have not received an official complaint from the French federation.

In the same Deschamps press conference a Honduran journalist insisted his country was not responsible for the small, unmanned aircraft that was presumably armed with a camera. ‘No?’ said Deschamps with more than a hint of suspicion.

If Honduras were responsible – and they continue to vehemently deny it – it did not do them much good here in Porto Alegre.

Was Lloris concerned on privacy grounds?

‘Players can do nothing about that,’ he said with a shrug. ‘We can’t have control of the drone. Maybe the guy is from the hotel just behind the stand and you can’t see him. Maybe with a good job of the security we can find him!’

If Karim Benzema was among those who launched a football at the drone, he proved more accurate against Honduras.

This World Cup has so far seen the big-name forwards make an early impact and Benzema was no exception, the Real Madrid striker scoring twice on his World Cup debut.

‘He had a really good season with Real Madrid, winning the Champions League final,’ said Lloris.

‘That has given him good confidence. He played well during the preparation games and he was in excellent condition to play today.

'He showed that, scoring two, maybe three depending on the FIFA goal-line decision, and it was important for him and for the team to start well because he is a decisive player for France. Maybe he is our key player and he showed it today.

‘When you play for Real Madrid you have to be a special player. He is still young but he is an excellent player. He has a big talent and for him this competition is the perfect platform to show who he is to everyone.

'This was his first game at the World Cup after being left out four years ago. For all players the World Cup only comes every four years and when you have the chance to play you have to take it.

'You have to enjoy the possibility to play at your best level and do everything for the team. That’s what every player did today.’

Lucky: But the Juventus midfielder could perhaps consider himself fortunate for not being sent off himself for an incident with the same player earlier

Lloris said the France players should be more than happy with the manner of their performance against physically aggressive opponents who were reduced to 10 men before half-time thanks to the dismissal of Wilson Palacios.

‘It’s a good start,’ said Lloris. ‘We expected that kind of game and we had a good control. It was a tough game physically because Honduras play very hard, very strong. But we stayed very calm and played our own game. We created some chances and we scored.

‘We have to stay calm because it’s just the first game. We have two more strong games against Switzerland and Ecuador, so it was important to get the three points today to put us in a good position with good confidence. I think the next game will be decisive for us.

‘I don’t want to compare to four years ago. But for me and everyone it was really important to start well this time and come into the competition with a good performance and a good result.’
