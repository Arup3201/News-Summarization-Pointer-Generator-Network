Luis Suarez scored to help Uruguay recover from a half-time deficit against Costa Rica in Montevideo, but the hosts were beaten 7-6 on penalties after Johan Venegas denied them a friendly victory with a late equaliser.

The match may have been officially an international friendly, but one look at the badly ripped shirt Suarez wore suggested otherwise.

Suarez, for once, was the man who had a chunk taken out of him. A large piece of his jersey was torn off after a tussle with Costa Rica defender Giancarlo Gonzales. The Barcelona striker wriggled free of his marker, who desperately tried to grab hold of his man as he fell to the floor just outside the penalty area.

Uruguay: Muslera, M.Pereira, Gimenez, Godín, A.Pereira, Sanchez, Rios, Lodeiro, Cebolla, Cavani, Suarez.

Goals: Suarez 50, Gimenez 64, Cavani 67.

Costa Rica: Navas, Gamboa, Gonzalez, Duarte, Diaz, Ruiz, Tejeda, Borges, Ramirez, Saborio, Campbell.

Goals: Saborio 42, Ruiz 51, Venegas 90. 

Suarez scored early in the second half after Alvaro Saborio's strike had given the visitors a half-time lead.

Bryan Ruiz then restored Costa Rica's advantage within a minute of Suarez's equaliser, but two goals in three minutes from Jose Gimenez and Edinson Cavani looked to have Uruguay on course for victory. That lead held until the 91st minute when Venegas equalised for the visitors and took the game to penalties. 

Suarez scored the first spot kick to give Uruguay the lead in the shootout, but Celso Borges missed for Costa Rica.

After six successful penalties in a row, Arevalo Rios had the chance to win it for Uruguay, but his kick was saved by Real Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas.

With the scores level at 6-6 in the shootout, Guzman skied his penalty and gave Costa Rica the chance to snatch victory, which Cristian Gamboa accepted gratefully to seal a 7-6 win.

Costa Rica also ran out 3-1 winners when the teams met in their opening Group D fixture at the World Cup last summer in Fortaleza.
