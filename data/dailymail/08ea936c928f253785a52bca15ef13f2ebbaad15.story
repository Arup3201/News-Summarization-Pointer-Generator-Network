Next time someone asks you how wide the Milky Way is, you might want to rethink your answer of '100,000 light-years'.

Astronomers have discovered that a strange ring of distant stars may actually be part of our galaxy, making it 50 per cent bigger at 150,000 light-years wide.

This is based on re-analysis of a distant ring that surrounds our galaxy, which the astronomers think is now actually part of the Milky Way.

Astronomers in New York have revised the size estimate for our galaxy (shown). They now say it is 50 per cent bigger in size at 150,000 light-years wide, not 100,000 light-years. This is based on re-examining a ring of stars in the so-called Monoceros Ring

The team of scientists from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York studied the Monoceros Ring, which is a long ring-like filament of stars that ‘wraps’ around our galaxy three times.

It is located 65,000 light-years from our galaxy’s centre, and in total is 200,000 light-years in length.

Previously it was thought to be a stream of stars torn from the nearby Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy due to interactions with the Milky Way.

The Milky Way is thought contain more than 200 billion stars.

This makes it a ‘middleweight’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known, IC 1101, containing more than 100 trillion stars.

On a clear night, when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the Earth is about 2,500 stars.

Like more than two-thirds of the known galaxies, the Milky Way has a spiral shape.

At the centre of the spiral, a lot of energy and, occasionally, vivid flares are created.

Astronomers believe the Milky Way wasn’t always a stunning barred spiral. It formed into its current size by ‘eating’ other galaxies. 

Now, however, it seems that the ring may actually be part of our own galaxy, and could have been disturbed by other dwarf galaxies.

‘It looks to me like maybe these patterns are following the spiral structure of the Milky Way, so they may be related,’ Dr Heidi Newberg, from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, told Discovery News.

‘It now looks to me like it’s part of the disk,’ she added.

The latest discovery was made using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a projecting to map parts of the universe in three dimensions.

The results will be published in the Astrophysical Journal.

Another ring, known as the TriAnd Ring, may also be part of the Milky Way, further increasing its size.

To verify their theory, astronomers will use data from Europe’s Gaia telescope, which is also mapping stars in the Milky Way.
