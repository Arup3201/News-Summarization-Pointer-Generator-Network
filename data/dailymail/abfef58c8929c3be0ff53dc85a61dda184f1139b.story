Two Australian writers have been praised for donating prize money they received from Prime Minister Tony Abbott to organisations that have been left short by recent government policies.

Mr Abbott handed out a total of $600,000 at the Prime Minister's Literary Awards, the country's richest prize for writers in a range of categories.

Richard Flanagan, the co-winner of the fiction award for his novel The Narrow Road to the Deep North, accepted the prize from Mr Abbott - then promptly announced he would be giving the $40,000 to the Indigenous Literacy Foundation.

The organisation, which supplies new books and funds literacy projects in remote Indigenous communities, is one of many programs that will be affected by the $534 million the government has announced it will cut from Indigenous programs over the next five years.

In a second wave of irony and a double-whammy for Mr Abbott, the winner in the children's writing category, Bob Graham, announced he would donate $10,000 of his prize money to the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.

A well-known controversial topic for the Coalition government which promised to 'stop the boats', the ASRC is currently lobbying against the government's new migration laws which it claims neglects more than 150 asylum seeking children in detention at Nauru.

The indirect slights came after a tough week for Mr Abbott and his government, who have been scrutinised on talk shows and voting polls over their policies and actions.

In his acceptance speech, Mr Flanagan, who has said previously the Abbott government's environmental policies made him 'ashamed to be an Australian', said 'the measure of any civilised society was its willingness to look after its weakest'.

'Money is like sh**, my father used to say. Pile it up and it stinks. Spread it around and you can grow things,' Mr Flanagan said, according to the ABC.

The past week has been a tough one for Mr Abbott and his government, who have been scrutinised on talk shows and voting polls over their policies and actions 

'If just one of those children in turn becomes a writer, if just one brings to Australia and to the world an idea of the universe that arises out of that glorious lineage of 60,000 years of Australian civilisation, then I will think this prize has rewarded not just me, but us all,' he said.

Mr Graham's speech about his book's character, also appeared to include a hint of irony when taking into account the presenter of his award.

'I like to think that after the book is closed that he will grow into a man who will have empathy and understanding and compassion for what he sees out there,' he said before announcing where his prize money would be directed.

The two authors have been commended across social media for their generous donations, with many people being quick to point out the irony.

One meme being circulated depicting Bob Graham said: 'That awkward moment when the asylum seeker persecuting PM gives you a literary award and you donate 10K to the asylum seeker resource centre'.

Meanwhile the ASRC also took to Twitter to tell Tony Abbott: 'You could learn from this, PM'.

The executive director for the Indigenous Literacy Foundation, Karen Williams, also told Daily Mail Australia that she hoped Mr Flannigan's example would one day would be followed by Australia's leaders.

'Ironically we don't receive any government funding so we're not affected [by government funding cuts] as of yet, but we are started to see the impact of cut backs because more communities are approaching us about our programs,' Ms Williams said.

'There is a huge need out there; almost 90 per cent of the remote communities we survey told us there were no books in their homes or few too little and in many communities it's very challenging and books are way down on the list of priorities.

'We're overwhelmed by the enormous generosity, it's so unexpected and it's such a generous gift for a writer to give - for Richard to turn around and do this for the greater good is such an uplifting gesture.'
