If the shoe fits...use it to open your wine bottle.

For wine aficionados lacking a corkscrew - or jokers looking for a new party trick - comes the latest innovation sure to blow your top off. 

Stephen Cronk from Mirabeau Wine in Provence has released a new video which shows how to open a bottle of vino without a corkscrew. All you need is a shoe, a wall and a thirst for the grape.

No corkscrew? No worries: A Mirabeau Wines expert demonstrates how wine lovers can pull a cork out of a bottle using their shoe

Snug fit: After pulling the foil off the top, place the bottom of the bottle snugly in the heel of the shoe. Try to use a shoe with sides that go at least partway up the bottle

First, you have to remove the protective foil - or 'capsule' - covering the top of the bottle.

Then you place the bottom of the glassware snugly inside a shoe, preferably footwear a rubber sole to absorb the shock of the ensuing slam.

Gripping the bottle and shoe, bang the sole against a wall or tree several times until the cork eases out of the bottle. Then all you have to do is pour.

But how does it work? io9.com describes the process of 'cavitation' this way:

'The bubble of air at the top of the bottle moves to the bottom of the bottle as it gets accelerated backwards. The sudden, hard strike of the bottle against the wall compresses the bubble of air.

'One side of it is being pushed against the glass, the other side has the wine pressing against it.

'The inside volume of the bottle stays the same size, but suddenly the volume of the air bubble plus the volume of the wine is smaller.

'Once the wine has hit the wall and rebounded, the bubbles that have just been created are pushed up against the cork. They burst and push the wine cork up and out of the bottle.'

Apparently the uncouth move is popular amongst restaurateurs and sommeliers.

But after this video, it's likely to catch on outside the food and beverage industry. Cheers to that! 

Smack it: Hit the heel of the shoe against a hard vertical surface like a wall or a tree. The shoe will cushion the bottle while the pressure from the blows should force the cork out

Pour forth: After a few hard knocks, the cork will come out far enough that you can just yank it

The grand finale: The cork should be pushed out far enough to enable you to yank it
