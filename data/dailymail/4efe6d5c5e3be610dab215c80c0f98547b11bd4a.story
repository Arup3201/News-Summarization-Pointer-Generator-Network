Several Wyoming schools have dropped the new federal rules pushed by First Lady Michelle Obama after saying they had an overwhelming negative reaction from students.

Wyoming Sheridan Country District One business manager Jeremy Smith said 'there were just too many complaints' for his district to stay in the National School Lunch Program.

'Universally, it was, ‘We are starving. We are hungry. This isn’t enough food for us.’ But we couldn’t blame them, because I looked at that school lunch and said, ‘I wouldn’t eat it either,’ he told Wyoming Public Media.

Several Wyoming schools have dropped the new federal rules pushed by First Lady Michelle Obama after saying they had an overwhelming negative reaction from students

Students have complained that the small portions are not enough for them to have a satisfying lunch 

The rules set by Congress and the administration over the last several years require more fruits, vegetables and whole grains in the lunch line and set limits on sodium, sugar, and fat.

This Summer Michelle Obama met with officials who claimed the guidelines were working in their schools. 

The Education Action Group reports that the Wyoming district had sales jump 20 per cent after abandoning the new rules.

They now offer bigger portions and have increased their prices as well as offering 'locally sourced produce and beef.'

The district's food service director Dennis Decker told reporters: 'A one-size-fits-all program doesn't work everywhere.

Smaller districts may have more problems with the guidelines since they have a smaller staff to deal with the changes and many students have chosen to bring lunches to school rather than purchase the new offerings

'And I also think that food is a little too personal to make a law. You can tell someone they can’t speed, but I don’t you can tell everybody what they have to eat every day.'

The districts that have left the federal program do not get reimbursements.

Big Horn student Ethyn Etchechoury told Wyoming media that last year the portions were not big enough and he often brought his won lunch to school. 

Big Horn High School in Wyoming is one of several schools to abandon the regulations citing poor sales and student complaints 

But since the changes he's satisfied with the school's offerings.

'I've never brought a bag lunch this year,' he said. 

At least one rural Oregon district has also dropped the regulations.

Administrators blamed poor sales to students and a large amount of paperwork.

'Kids quit eating. More whole wheat, more green veggies, no salt - it's not as palatable,' said Jordan Valley District business manager LeeAnn Conro, who added that the paperwork to ensure each serving met the standards for nutrition was too much to deal with. 

Smaller districts may have more problems with the guidelines since they have a smaller staff to deal with the changes.
