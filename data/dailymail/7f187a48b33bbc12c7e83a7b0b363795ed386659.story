Hatem Ben Arfa proved he’s still a Newcastle fan favourite as the Hull loanee watched the 2-2 draw back at St James’ Park in the stands on Saturday.

The Frenchman was a popular player during a four year spell at Newcastle before falling out with manager Alan Pardew and was exiled to the reserves.

Arfa was ineligible to play against his parent club but was desperate to be at the game and join his new team-mates at his former club home.

The midfielder posed for photos with Newcastle fans and even celebrated Hull’s second goal with scorer Mohammed Diame who signalled out his colleague in the crowd.

Newcastle fans see Arfa’s deadline day move to Hull on loan as an example of why Pardew should depart as manager, with a group of supporters ramping up their ‘Sack Pardew’ campaign before kick-off on Saturday.

The group printed thousands of flyers, posters and even has a banner made up to display outside the ground before kick-off against Hull but the protests inside the ground were nowhere near as vehement as expected.
