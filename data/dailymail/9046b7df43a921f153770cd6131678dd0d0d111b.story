The family of a three-year-old boy killed in a Missouri house fire while police used a stun gun on his stepfather as the man tried to save the child are now suing for city of Louisiana for wrongful death.

Riley Rieser was killed in the early hours of October 31, 2013. 

As his stepfather, Ryan Miller, attempted to enter the burning house, a police officer tasered Mr Miller three times and handcuffed him to stop him going inside.

'I was hysterical, yes, because I wanted to save my son,' Mr Miller told the Louisiana Press Journal.

Riley Rieser, 3, was tragically killed in a house fire on October 31, 2013, in Louisiana, Missouri. His family are now suing the city after the boy's stepfather, Ryan Miller, was tasered and handcuffed by police

Grandmother Lori Miller said she witnessed two officers use the stun gun three times, twice after Ryan Miller had been handcuffed.

Mr Miller suffered chest burns and was taken to the city jail, although he was later released without being charged.

City Administrator Bob Jenne called the police response a 'judgment call'.

However the family say it was the wrong judgement, and are now suing on the grounds of excessive, negligent infliction of emotional distress, wrongful death and false imprisonment.

The lawsuit was filed March 12 and was obtained by Courthouse News. 

The family are seeking unspecified damages

'Officers Jeffrey Salois and William Harrison prevented Ryan Miller from entering the home to save his stepson Riley Rieser by forcibly moving and by repeatedly Tasing Ryan Miller, including once in the police cruiser as Riley Rieser was being removed from the home,' the lawsuit reads.

Riley Miller's aunt Emily has described the actions of the police as 'heartless' and she doesn't think they handled the situation correctly

The original 911 call for the fire came in at 12.58am and firefighters arrived at the scene at 1.03am. 

Both of Riley's parents were taken to Memorial Medical Center's burn unit in Springfield, Ill. by family members for treatment. 

Cathy Miller suffered a burn to the cornea in one of her eyes. Both she and her husband were released from hospital on Thursday night.

Lori Miller said police stunned her son Ryan as he tried to get back in the house.

'He tried to get back in the house to get the baby,' she told KHQA. 'They took my son to jail because he tried to save his son.'

Riley's aunt Emily Miller has publicly criticized how police handled the situation.

'It's just heartless. How could they be so heartless? And while they all just stood around and waited for the fire department, what kind of police officer wouldn't try and save a three-year-old burning in a house?' she told KHQA.

'We've been going through pictures and he's just smiling in every picture. He was just a happy, go-lucky kid.'

The fire started in a recreation room at the rear of the house. The official cause was faulty wiring, according to the complaint.

The parents had fallen asleep watching television, but were woken by the smoke alarm and managed to get out of the building via a rear door in the same room. They then called 911.  

Wreck: A city police officer fired his stun gun at Ryan Miller as he tried to re-enter his burning home, which was destroyed

Riley was asleep in his bedroom and so Ryan Miller ran to the front of the house and kicked in the front door. Police arrived as he was about to enter and an officer stunned him with a Taser.

State Fire Marshal Investigator Scott 
Stoneberger said that a firefighter in full gear attempted to enter the 
home but the flames were too hot.

Firefighters discovered Riley near the doorway to the bedroom from the front living room.

Ryan Miller has another son who wasn't home at the time of the blaze.
