A
 former Christian radio host, who admitted to raping an 11-year-old boy, had a 
rented storage unit where he kept a 'bondage kit' of handcuffs, chains and 
duct tape, a federal spokesman confirmed to MailOnline today. 

John Balyo, 35, has been charged with first-degree criminal sexual conduct after he confessed last week to having sex with a child.

It is claimed that Balyo, from Battle Creek, Michigan, paid a man to arrange a sex session with a minor for him.

Former Christian radio DJ John Balyo, 35, (pictured with an unidentified child), was charged with having sex with a minor. Federal agents revealed today they found his storage unit in Michigan containing handcuffs and duct tape

He was arrested last 
Friday while at the Big Ticket Christian music festival in Gaylord, 
Michigan. He was a morning show host on Christian station WCSG.

The handcuffs and other items were found in a suitcase after police searched a storage unit in Plainfield Township last Friday.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokesman told MailOnline on Thursday that while being interviewed, Balyo indicated that he had a storage unit and gave officers permission to search the space.

A padlock, rubber gloves and children's socks were also discovered, MLive reported.

Balyo also had piles of articles about missing children and children's obituaries, it was reported, along with an erotic photography magazine.

The 35-year-old admitted to raping a boy, a Calhoun County prosecutor said at Balyo's arraignment on Monday.

The accused was denied bail after being charged with first- and second-degree criminal sexual conduct.  He is now facing the rest of his life in prison.

Balyo got married in April and has a stepson, according to the Christian Post.

According to Mlive.com, prosecutor
 David Gilbert said Balyo admitted to 'some' charges which police said 
related to a single incident at a home in Battle Creek on May 17.

The
 DJ allegedly paid resident Ronald Moser, 41, to have sex with a young boy. Authorities who raided Moser's property on June 5 found him at the home with a boy.

According to mlive.com, in a photo album allegedly posted online by Moser, there were ten images of a young boy lying face down on a bed.

His hands and feet were bound and he was wearing only underwear, which had been rolled up to show his buttocks, according to a federal agent.

The albums had titles such as 'very cute boy,' and 'sexy boys', police said.

The FBI said Moser put images online and planned to trade in child 
porn. It is alleged that Moser ran a website providing sex with underage boys for money.

The investigation into the alleged pedophiles has involved multiple agencies as part of a larger 'Operation Predator'. 

Balyo was fired from his job at WCSG and the station publicly asked for prayers for the former host, his family and alleged victims.

The 35-year-old had been at the radio station for eight years.

In a statement, WCSG said: 'We sincerely grieve over these recent
 events, in particular the tragic impact on victims and their parents. 
The trafficking and exploitation of minors is absolutely deplorable.

'The WCSG family is deeply aching and know you may be hurting as well.'

A spokesman added: 'We know that no one, absolutely no one, 
is immune from falling into the darkness of sin. And yet, we have hope. 
Those who truly follow and live for Jesus Christ know He alone has the 
power to restore broken lives and broken trust.'

Balyo returns to court for a hearing on July 7 and faces trial on August 18.
