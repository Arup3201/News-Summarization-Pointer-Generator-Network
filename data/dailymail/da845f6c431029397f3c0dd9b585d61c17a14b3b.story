A 74-year-old California woman is free after serving 32 years of a life sentence for her role in a 1981 killing.

Mary Virginia Jones walked out of Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood around 11 p.m. Monday and was met by joyful family and friends, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Jones was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery and sentenced to life without parole for a killing committed alongside boyfriend Mose Willis, who died while on death row.

She always maintained that the abusive Willis forced her at gunpoint to help him rob and shoot two drug dealers, one of whom died. Law students at the University of Southern California's Post-Conviction Justice Project took up her cause.

Hooray: Friend, Patricia Elder, left, hugs Mary Virginia Jones, 74, Monday night who was serving life without parole for her role in a 1981 murder, and was freed from prison

Huge moment: Jones, pictured, walked out of Century Regional Detention Facility around 11 p.m. to big hugs from family and friends, who shared tears and laughter

Jones expected to be shot and killed and 
the subsequent trials did not take into account her history as a 
battered victim, the justice project's directing attorney, Heidi Rummel,
 told the Times.

Los Angeles County prosecutors 
conducted a new investigation and agreed to accept a plea of no contest 
for involuntary manslaughter.

Judge
 William C. Ryan ruled Monday afternoon that Jones had served well over 
the 11-year maximum sentence for the lesser crime and ordered her freed.

Her family praised the Lord and sobbed after the judge issued his ruling.

Jones,
 using a magnifying glass to help her see, read her plea in court 
Monday: 'I did not willingly participate in this crime, but I believe 
entering a no contest plea is in my best interest to get out of 
custody.'

Freed: 74-year-old grandmother Mary Virginia Jones was released from prison late on Monday after spending 32 years behind bars for a murder that was actually committed by her abusive boyfriend

Outrageous: Jones was a church-going, devoted mother when she was subjected to four separate trials before finally being put in prison

Deputy District Attorney Hyman Sisman said he would not comment on the investigation except to say 'justice was done.'

Jones'
 daughter, 53-year-old Denitra Jones-Goodie, told the newspaper her 
mother always believed that someday she would be released.

'She's got strength on top of strength,' she said.

The murder for which Jones was imprisoned so long, was actually committed by her abusive boyfriend, Mose Willis, and she was forced at gunpoint to drive to the spot where he murdered a drug dealer.

On
 Monday, judge tossed her first degree murder conviction after Jones 
pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in exchange for her release.

Cries of 'Thank you Jesus!' and 'hallelujah' rang out as the Los Angeles judge spoke the word 'released' on Monday morning.

It was a word that Jones' friends and family--who all call her Mother Mary--thought they'd never hear.

It marked the much deserved end to a saga that spanned decades and put a victim of abuse through four separate trials, including a reversal on appeal because the court failed to properly instruct the jury and excluded evidence of her duress defense and two hung juries.

Jones was charged in 1981 along with her abusive boyfriend Willis, who kidnapped two drug dealers and forced Jones to drive to an alley.

There, Willis killed one of the men as Jones fled for her life, expecting to be murdered as well.

Instead, she was discovered at a friend's home and arrested days later.

'She knew this day was coming': Jones' daughter Denitra Jones-Goodie, pictured Monday, described to reporters the heartache she's gone through leading to this day

Challenge: UCLA law students successfully challenged Jones' 1982 conviction, saying the jury would never have convicted her had they heard expert testimony on what was then known as Battered Woman's Syndrome

Students
 in USC's Post-Conviction Justice Project challenged the conviction on 
the argument that had the jury heard testimony on the effects of what 
was then known as Battered Women's Syndrome, she never would have been 
convicted.

'The 
procedural history of Mary's case gave me a greater appreciation for the
 pitfalls of the justice system,' said UCLA law student Laura Donaldson.

'After first learning that it took four trials to convict Mary, I was 
shocked and even more motivated to get her out of prison. I am so happy 
that Mary will finally get the justice she deserves.'

According
 to Jones' lawyers, a week prior to the crime, Willis shot at Jonesâ€™s 
daughter and threatened to kill both of them if they went to the police.

'He
 pulled a gun on me and shot at me, and my mother witnessed that,' said 
her daughter Denitra Jones-Goodie. 'And he threatened to not only kill 
me but to kill her and anybody else that came to our aid.'

Jones
 was a church going employee of the Los Angeles Unified School District 
and devoted mother before she met Willis, who was homeless at the time.

She
 was taken in by his promises he was looking to live a 'clean life' just
 months before the crime and has since paid the price.

Willis died on death row.

Thanks to the help of the UCLA students, Jones has been reunited with her family.

'She never should have been incarcerated in the first place, but she's free, thank God,' Jones-Goodie said.

'It
 has not been the same for any of us, me in particular, since my mother 
has been gone...I really felt as though I had lost a part of my being.
