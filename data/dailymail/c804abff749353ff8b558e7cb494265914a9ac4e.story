Top Gear has sparked a major row in New Zealand after authorities were forced to apologise to Maoris for letting the show film a high-speed stunt on a 'spiritual' beach.

Staff from the BBC's flagship motoring show are set to descend on Ninety Mile Beach next week to record a 150kmh scene for the programme, which is fronted by Jeremy Clarkson.

The move has led to an outcry by Maori peoples after the broadcaster was granted special permission to use the beach - also known as Te Oneroa-a-Tohe - at short notice.

The filming schedule means a 50km stretch of the beach, which is also classed as a public road with a speed limit of 100kph, could be closed for several hours a day for up to a week.

It has not yet been revealed whether Clarkson, 52, or fellow presenters James May or Richard Hammond will be getting behind the wheel of the speeding car, which will be followed by a chase car to record the action.

The sprawling beach, in Northland on New Zealand's north island, is used by Maoris for food gathering and recreations as well as for spiritual reasons.

A spokesman for Far North District Council said the BBC had been granted special dispensation to film the stunt, along with other pieces for future episodes, on the beach between March 11 and March 17.

The council had to grant permission 
for the closure without going through its normal process - advertising 
the proposals and allowing two weeks for public submissions - because 
the request came in just 14 days before the beach needed to be closed.

Five
Maori iwi (peoples) - Te Rarawa, Te Aupouri, Ngai Takoto, Ngati Kuri, 
and Ngati Kahu - have custodianship of the beach but the council only 
approached Ngati Kuri for permission to grant the road closure outside 
the normal process.

The 
council spokesman apologised to the iwi for the lack of consultation, 
adding that the beach would only be closed in short stretches for just 
five minutes at a time during the high-speed scenes.

Other stretches of the beach would be shut down for up to 45 minutes at a time on two of the other days of filming, he added.

'The
council has apologised (to the other iwi) that we didn't take the 
consultation far enough and we will be taking steps to ensure 
appropriate consultation is done in the future,' the spokesman said.

Top Gear is one of the BBC's most successful programmes, but has run into plenty of controversy along the way.

In November 2008 he made a joke about
how tough it is to change gear in a lorry - and linked it to the 
Suffolk Strangler Stephen Wright, who murdered sex workers in Ipswich.

Clarkson said: 'Change gear, change gear, change gear, check mirror, murder a prostitute, change gear, change gear, murder. That's a lot of effort in a day.'

In February 2009, Clarkson famously called then-prime minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'.

A year later he illustrated dangerous driving conditions with a joke about a woman in a burka wearing a red G-string, which was branded 'distasteful'.

Spin doctor Alastair Campbell revealed on his blog in the same month that in an un-aired comment Clarkson was asked by him about gay rights and he replied, 'I demand the right not to be bummed.'

In other gaffes he compared a Ferrari to a person with special needs, called Mexicans 'lazy', 'feckless' and 'flatulent', said long queues at airport control could be solved by 'a bit of racism' and was caught parking in a disabled driver bay while filming - receiving large numbers of complaints. 

Earlier this year he compared a Japanese car to the Elephant Man and people with 'growths on their faces'.

The BBC Trust's editorial standards committee this week gave him another slap on the wrist for the scripted remarks, ruling that he had 'strayed into an offensive stereotypical assumption'.

Probably his most shocking moment came on The One Show, where he said that striking public sector workers 'should be shot in front of their families'.

Clarkson was forced to apologise and the regulator launched an investigation after his remark sparked around 31,700 complaints. He was later cleared.
