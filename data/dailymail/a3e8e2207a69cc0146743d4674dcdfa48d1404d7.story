It’s unusual for Apple not to be leading the way when it comes to product design, but new reports claim when it comes to its iWatch the firm is having to play catch up with Motorola. 

During a trip to Taiwan, a New York tech analyst said an Apple supplier revealed a number of features of the much-rumoured device, including a rounded face and slim design.

This would resemble how the Moto 360 looks -  and contradicts previous reports the watch would have a curved, or square screen.

New York analyst Brian Blair claims an Apple supplier has revealed the iWatch will have a rounded face, similar to the Moto 360, pictured, come in male and female versions, and will go into production in July. Previous reports suggested it would have a curved, or square screen like the G Watch and Samsung's Gear range

Speculation
 around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release 
date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013.

Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget.

It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone.

Other
 rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let 
users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen.

The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet.

In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch.

Last month, an analyst said the device will come in 'his' and 'hers' models and cost 'thousands' of dollars.

If the rumours are true, Apple could announced the device at its annual September event.

The reports were made by Brian Blair from Rosenblatt Securities.

According to his supply chain sources, the iWatch will be designed to look like a traditional watch, and move away from the chunky, square look of the G Watch and Samsung’s Gear range.

Motorola announced its own plans for a round, Android-powered smartwatch earlier this year and Blair's sources claim Apple’s version will be almost identical, if not a little thinner. 

As Business Insider noted, Apple’s icons have rounded edges and this would suit a circular face.

Blair’s source also confirmed previous rumours that the iWatch would be available in ‘his’ and ‘hers’ models, and will go into production from July.

The design is similar to concepts created by Mark Bell from Belmdesigns. 

Bell’s concept incorporates the rumoured 
Healthbook fitness features that leaked in March, but experts believe 
Apple could additionally be working on a separate wristband specifically
 designed to track health.

Google announcement comes just a week after sources revealed Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc will start mass production of Apple first smartwatch in July, and the much anticipated timepiece will be revealed in October. Pictured is a concept design of what the iWatch may look like

By comparison, the LG G Watch, pictured, has a square, 2-inch display and runs Android Wear - a streamlined version of Google's current operating system seen on phones and tablet. The Samsung range of Gear devices similarly chose a square, rather than rounded design

The Moto 360, pictured, is expected to launch at Google's I/O in June, followed by the iWatch in September

Earlier this week, during the unveiling of its latest G3 handset, LG gave a sneak peek of its square Android-powered G Watch.

All three - the Moto 360, the G Watch and the iWatch - are expected to launch later this year.

It’s likely the Moto 360 will be announced at Google’s I/O in June, and go on sale for £180 in July, followed by the iWatch during Apple’s annual September event.

Price-wise, an Apple iWatch may follow the same pattern as Apple’s handsets and sit at the top end of the market.

Reports last month even stated it could cost ‘thousands’ of dollars.

Although the smartwatches of Samsung and Sony haven’t been as popular as analysts predicted, Blair said orders for the iWatch are surpassing expectation and he forecasts 18 to 21 million iWatches will be sold before Christmas.

Last night, Samsung revealed a new smart wristband and announced plans to let manufacturers use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market.

It also revealed an online service to track the data - just days before Apple is expected to reveal its 'Healthbook' app for the iPhone.

 of next week's developers conference by rival Apple.

The new claims about a rounded design contradict previous reports the iWatch would have a curved screen, as seen in this concept by Todd Hamilton

Tag Heuer, part of luxury goods group LVMH, said on Friday its vice president for sales, Patrick Pruniaux, who had been with the brand for seven years, was leaving on Monday to join Apple - and is expected to work on the iWatch.

There
 is widespread speculation Apple has been working on wearable 
devices, and its products tend to use proprietary technologies. However, an open system would be a departure for Samsung as well.

Its Gear wristwatches and fitness devices currently work only with Samsung phones.

Smartwatches from Sony and other manufacturers tend to work with a wider range of Android phones.

Last night, Samsung revealed a new smart wristband and announced plans to let manufacturers use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market. Ram Fish, Vice President of Digital Health for Samsung is pictured displaying the Simband
