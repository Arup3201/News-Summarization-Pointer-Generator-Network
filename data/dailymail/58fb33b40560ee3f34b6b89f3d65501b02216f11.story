Former England captain Mike Gatting believes the time has come to consign the Kevin Pietersen chapter to the past once and for all.

Amid the off-field issues, Pietersen remains England's highest run-scorer and there is some talk about a national return despite the troubles, not least from the player himself.

In his time away from England cricket, Pietersen has turned out for Twenty20 sides in different countries, including in the Indian Premier League, and has played in the same format for Surrey this year.

Mike Gatting has poured cold water on a possible international return for Kevin Pietersen

Pietersen has criticised several of his former England team-mates, including Matt Prior (right), in his new book 

However, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is unlikely to grant him a return, and Gatting has little doubt as to the reasons.

'He spent a whole summer here with Surrey supposedly but didn't play championship cricket or anything else,' Gatting said.

'He says he would like to play for England, but sometimes his actions haven't coupled with the words, which is sad because he's a hugely talented cricketer.

'Perhaps if he'd played for Surrey and got a few hundreds for them, perhaps that might have promoted his case a bit more.'

Pietersen, writing in his autobiography which is released this week, also claimed there was a culture of bullying in the England squad and pointed the finger at Matt Prior, Graeme Swann, James Anderson and Stuart Broad.

Swann has since rejected the claims as 'codswallop', and even accused Pietersen of indulging in bullying himself.

The furore around Pietersen's autobiography reached new levels on Tuesday with the emergence of a document cataloguing his alleged behaviour during last winter's Ashes.

However, with England set to tour Sri Lanka in the build-up to next year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, Gatting has little time to dwell on the past.

He told Press Association Sport: 'I just hope we look forward and not back.

'I'm more concerned that we look at the players we've got - Moeen Ali, Joe Root, Gary Ballance, (Jos) Buttler.

'All these guys are who we want to see now because that's where they are now.

'They're in the team and we'd like to see them go forward. History is the past and we're looking to the present.'

When asked if the Pietersen saga could adversely affect England's preparation for the winter tours, Gatting said: 'I hope not.

'Having watched the young guys in the summer, they look very capable of doing it.

'When you have the likes of (Alex) Hales, Buttler, (Ben) Stokes, (Ian) Bell and (Alastair) Cook - lots of fine players.

'It's quite an interesting period for England cricket. We have inspiring cricketers and I'm very hopeful we'll see some really good stuff from the guys in the winter.'
