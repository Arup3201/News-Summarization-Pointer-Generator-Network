The wreckage of a wooden steamship carrying 106 passengers, which sank in San Francisco Bay in 1888, has been found.

More than a century after the City of Chester was nearly sliced in half by a ship twice its size, sonar has located the boat 216ft below the surface.

The wreckage from the bay's second-worst maritime disaster was found as oceanographers charted shipping channels before the America's Cup.

Tragic: The City of Chester was carrying 90 passengers on the 1888 trip from the San Francisco bay to Eureka. She was split in two by a ship more than twice its size, killing 16 people and becoming the bay's second-worst maritime disaster

On the day the Chester sank, killing 16 people including two children and three crew members, a dense fog was filling the bay.

The Chester was carrying passengers from San Francisco to Eureka when it collided with a large immigrant ship.

More
 than a century after it sank, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration team has found the resting place of the doomed ship.

The
 crew used sonic imaging equipment to capture new three-dimensional 
images of the wreckage in May last year, and released their findings 
this week.

'Using a 
multi-beam sonar system, crews got nice three-dimensional sound pictures
 of the bottom that showed a wreck sitting upright,' James Delgado, a NOAA shipwreck researcher and archaeologist who was chief scientist for the 2010 mapping of the Titanic, said.

The
 shipwreck's rough location was first discovered two years after it 
sank, but the sonar and renewed research into the collision has 
unearthed new details.

The sonar showed the wreck's hull rising about 18ft from the sea bed, and clearly reveals the gash in the hull which caused it to sink.

When researchers looked into the background of the crash, they found tons of newspaper articles and transcripts of testimony from the accident investigation.

Delgado said newspapers at the time put much of the blame for the deaths on the crew of the immigrant steamer, the Oceanic, which survived the ordeal with a few dents in its hull.

Yet, NOAA scientists say much of the newspaper coverage failed to include witness accounts of heroism, and that the official investigation faulted the Chester's skipper with the accident.

'The papers initially reacted, talking about the tragedy and accusations that the Chinese crew stood by and let people drown,' Delgado said.

'But what happens is you start to see things also come out ...  countering that. Some leaped in water to save a drowning child.'

'History is made up of aÂ  lot of people who never made it into the books,' Delgado told NBC Bay Area.

'Same with this shipwreck. It was filled with everyday people who got into a situation beyond their control.'

A thick fog was covering the bay on the morning of August 22, when the Chester set off, but research showed the seas were calm.

But there was a big incoming tide, which created a rip current off Fort Point near the mouth of the bay, which affected the Chester's ability to move quickly.

The two ships spotted each other when they were about a half-mile apart but failed to reverse their engines in time.

The Oceanic's bow went 10ft into the hull of the Chester, and the Oceanic's captain kept some momentum in the ship to keep the hole plugged in an effort to give people a chance to escape.

However, five or six minutes later, the Chester was gone.

'The Oceanic crew was up on the bow reaching down to survivors on the Chester, lifting them on the deck,' Robert Schwemmer, NOAA's West Coast regional maritime heritage coordinator, said.

'After the collision, in five or six minutes, the Oceanic crew went on to save a lot of people.'

The sinking was the second worst maritime disaster in the Bay, after the Rio de Jeneiro struck rocks on the way into port in 1901, exploded and sank with the loss of 130 people.

No attempt will be made to raise the ship but a display with the Chester's history and new images will open at San Francisco's Chrissy Field, which looks over the spot where the ship went down in front of the Golden Gate Bridge.
