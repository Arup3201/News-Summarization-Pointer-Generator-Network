One of the world's top architects has turned her hand to fashion.

Zaha Hadid, who usually lends her skills to conceptualising futuristic sculptures, has now created a wacky pair of designer footwear.

The Iranian-British Dame collaborated on the mind-bending chrome shoe boots, retail at £1,300, with architecture-bourne shoe brand United Nude.

The casing is made of metallic chromed vinyl 
rubber, while the heel and platform is crafted from fibreglass and inside they are
lined with fine kid leather.

Hadid received the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2004, the architecture equivalent to a Nobel Prize.

She was first commissioned to imagine luxury footwear brand Stuart Weitzman's new Milan store, and now dabbles in design of actual shoes.

Together with United Nude's creative director Rem D Koolhaas, Hadid came up with the boundary-pushing NOVA shoes.

'I have always appreciated those who dare to experiment with materials and proportions,' said Hadid.

'Our collaboration with United Nude reinterprets the classic shoe typology, pushing the boundaries of what is possible without compromising integrity.'

The shoes are on display at concept store L'éclaireur in Paris and will retail for £1,300. A limited-edition run of 100 pairs in black, bronze and rose gold colourways have been made.

Hadid has previously dabbled in fashion by teaming up with Louis Vuitton, Swarovski and Brazilian shoe brand Melissa.

These 'front heel' Scary Beautiful 
shoes were designed by South African student artist Leanie van der Vyver
as a critique on the fashion industry's quest for perfection.

Dutch shoe maker René van den Berg fabricated the wacky design, which landed designer Leanie a nomination for the prestigious Gerrit Rietveld design prize at her university in Holland.

Mr Kobi Levi, from Tel Aviv, Israel, spends weeks making his 'wearable sculpture' shoes by hand.

He makes footwear resembling children's slides, coffee jugs and even ones resembling celebrities.

Each heel of his coffee jug creations has been carved out of wood, 
and lacquered brown so that they resemble hot flowing coffee complete 
with a puddle at the bottom.

The
36-year-old has previously transformed the ordinary high heel in to 
everything from everyday items like shopping baskets to celebrities, 
including pop legend Madonna. Others have been shaped to look like a banana and even a toucan.
