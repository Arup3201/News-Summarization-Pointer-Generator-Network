Santi Cazorla has been named the PFA Fans' Player of the Month for January following a magnificent month for the Spaniard and his Arsenal side.

A goal and an assist for the 30-year-old aided Arsenal as they moved up to fifth place in the Premier League table.

Despite a poor opening game of 2015 - Arsenal lost 2-0 at Southampton - the Gunners went on to win their remaining four fixtures in January.

A 2-0 win at home to Hull City in the FA Cup third round was followed by a 3-0 victory against Stoke City at the Britannia in the Premier League.

However, the Gunners' standout result of January was their impressive 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium - when Cazorla scored from the penalty spot and shone in his side's victory over the defending Premier League champions.

Finally, Arsenal saw off Brighton & Hove Albion 3-0 away from home in the FA Cup fourth round - their final fixture in January- in another game in which Cazorla excelled, as they capped off an extremely successful month.

The Gunners and Cazorla will be hoping to continue their excellent form when they travel to White Hart Lane to face Tottenham Hotspur in this weekend's north London derby. 

Spurs are just two points behind their rivals in the battle for a Champions League place. 

In addition to Cazorla being named PFA Fans' Player of the Month, one supporter who voted for the Gunners' midfielder will also get the opportunity to give the Spaniard the award in person.
