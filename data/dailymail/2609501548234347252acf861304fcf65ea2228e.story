The woman whose death went unnoticed for six years somehow voted in Michigan's 2010 gubernatorial election.

Mummified remains were discovered in the Pontiac home belonging to 49-year-old Pia Farrenkopf last week, when a contractor was dispatched to the property when it went into foreclosure.

The remains found in the backseat of a jeep parked in the home's garage have not been positively identified yet, but authorities believe the body belongs to Farrenkopf.

Adding more mystery to the gruesome discovery is the fact that Farrenkopf registered to vote in 2006 and even cast a vote in the 2010 elections, though authorities believe she died at some point in 2008.

The
 city clerk told the Detroit Free-Press that Farrenkopf's vote in the governor's race may have been 
an 'administrative error' since infrequent voters tend to participate in
 presidential races (like the one in 2008), as opposed to local ones.

'Everything
 to date points toward late 2008,' Oakland County Sheriff Michael 
Bouchard said. 'This information, obviously, has to be run to its 
logical conclusion.'

Farrenkopf's sister believes that foul play was involved in her death.

Paula Logan told wxyz.com: 'I think there was foul play. I think someone might have been in that garage.'

Logan insisted that her sister was not the type of person to commit suicide.

The remains were discovered only last 
Wednesday when a bank contractor was sent to the home to investigate a 
hole in the roof after it went into foreclosure in March 2013.

Farrenkopf's payments for her 
mortgage, utilities and other bills, were automatically deducted from 
her bank account which at one time contained $54,000.

The
 money finally ran out, leading to the grim discovery of the woman's 
mummified body lying on the back seat of a Jeep Liberty registered to 
Farrenkopf inside the garage.

Undersheriff
 Mike McCabe told Detroit Free Press that investigators believe the 
woman has been dead since at least 2008. That’s the year the license 
plate on Farrenkopf's Jeep expired.

The
 body was clothed in a heavy jacket and jeans, leading investigators to 
believe that it was winter when she died. The key was in the ignition, 
but it was switched to the off position.

Investigators
 are treating the death as a homicide at this time and say suicide by 
carbon monoxide seems unlikely. The body shows no signs of trauma, 
McCabe says.

Dr Bernadino Pacris, the Oakland 
County deputy medical examiner, said the skin was intact on the corpse, 
but the internal organs had decomposed.

Climate, weather and humidity play a role in preserving a body in such a way, he said.

The
 medical examiner's office is awaiting toxicology results and hopes to 
find dental records to identify whether the corpse is Farrenkopf.

Neighbors of Farrenkopf's on Savanna St said they never noticed anything amiss.

The woman lived alone and kept to herself, often disappearing for days or weeks on business.

According
 to the Detroit News, Farrenkopf was a contractor with Chrysler's 
financing division before her employment was terminated in September 
2008.

Unpaid bills: Mail for Pia Farrenkopf on the snowy driveway to the home she once owned

Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said that detectives had spoken to a sister of Farrenkopf in Boston, who told them that the two were estranged and had not spoken in years.

Ms Logan said that the Chrysler job had been the reason for her sister's move from Massachusetts to Detroit.

Neighbor Darryl Tillery, 49, said the woman’s mail never piled up at the house and her lawn was kept neat.

'It was pretty manicured,' he told the Detroit Free Press. 'There was no indication there was a body in there, at all.'

Some believed they no longer saw Farrenkopf because she had moved to Germany, something she had indicated that she intended to do. Many left the area after the economy crashed in 2009 wand they could no longer afford their mortgage payments.

The outside of the home was fairly well maintained, but inside a black mold had taken over, McCabe said.

WXYZ reports that Farrenkopf's stepfather Edward Caroll, said she was estranged from her family.

Caroll married Farrenkopf’s mother three years ago. He said Pia Farrenkopf never answered the wedding invitation.

'I tried to find her through the Internet and everything and I never could find her.  And I wrote a letter a couple times and I think some of them came back. Her mother hadn’t heard from her for years and years.'

Farrenkopf's mother died a year and a half ago.
