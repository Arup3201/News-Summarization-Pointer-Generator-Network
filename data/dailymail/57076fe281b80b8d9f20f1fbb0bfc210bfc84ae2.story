Dead: FBI agents shot and killed Jim DiMaggio after they discovered him with Hannah in Idaho

An Idaho coroner says kidnapping suspect James Lee DiMaggio died after being hit by six gunshots fired by FBI agents during a rescue in the wilderness this summer.

Valley County Coroner Nathan Hess confirmed on Tuesday that the multiple gunshot wounds to DiMaggio's head, chest and extremities were the cause of death of the 40-year-old California man.

DiMaggio died on August 10 after his campsite was spotted in the vast Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness.

He became the focus of a massive manhunt for abducting 16-year-old Hannah Anderson and killing her brother Ethan and her mother Christina at DiMaggio's home about 65 miles east of San Diego. Hannah Anderson was rescued.

The final autopsy is pending a toxicology report. The death has also been classified as a homicide.

Hannah Anderson, meanwhile, is set
to speak for the first time about her terrifying ordeal where 
her captor allegedly zip-tied her, forced the teenager to play Russian roulette 
then murdered her mother and brother.

The 16-year-old from California says she feels 'shocked, sick and angry' following her abduction.

The teenager spoke to the Today
show with her father in an interview to air on Thursday. She traveled 
to New York for the taping from which she excitedly posted pictures on 
her Instagram account, including several close-ups of Miley Cyrus' live 
performance.

Miss Anderson told presenter Savannah Guthrie that things took a horrifying turn when DiMaggio brought her to his home on August 3.

DiMaggio handcuffed and zip-tied her feet, telling her in detail how he was going to abduct her and take her to Idaho.

The schoolgirl added that her role was to carry her kidnapper's backpacks and that he would 'get me home afterwards'.

The teenager has regularly posted to her public Instagram account in the wake of her mother and brother's tragic deaths. She added this picture on Monday from the airport in New York

The teenager described her fear when DiMaggio forced her to play a game of Russian roulette with a gun while her mother and brother were in the house. When she started to cry, he said they could stop the game.

Her mother and little brother were killed when DiMaggio's house burst into flames after he rigged it with explosives.

One of the riders who alerted authorities after coming across the teenage girl and her captor in the wilderness told the Today Show that there was 'pure fear' in the girl's eyes.

Happier times: Hannah Anderson posted this picture of her with her boyfriend to Instagram

During her short trip to New York City this week, the San Diego school girl updated her followers on Instagram with pictures of her hotel room and a montage of photos and video clips of Miley Cyrus. She told the followers that she got a hug from the singer.

The teenager paid tribute to her little brother Ethan on Monday on what would have been his 9th birthday.

As part of a longer message, the grieving teenager wrote: 'Sorry for blowing up your instas but I wanna say happy birthday to little E.

'Today he would have turned 9. And it breaks my heart to think how excited he was to celebrate it. He was always ready for his birthday and knew his plans a year before. I love you Ethan there's not a day I don't go without missing you.'
