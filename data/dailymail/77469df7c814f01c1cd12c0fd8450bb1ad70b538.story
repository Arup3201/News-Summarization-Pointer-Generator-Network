Irresponsible dog owners' days could be numbered as a company which matches dogs to the DNA left behind in their mess is reportedly in talks with local councils.

The PooPrints service works by building a DNA database of dogs in a particular area so any dog mess found can be quickly traced back to the offending animal - and its owner.

It's already in use in many U.S. apartment complexes and condo buildings, where operators report very high compliance rates as dog owners know they will be unable to deny the offence.

Poo time: But irresponsible dog owners' days could be numbered as a company which matches dogs to the DNA left behind in their mess is reportedly in talks with local councils to bring the service to the UK

And now north Wales-based biotech firm Streetkleen is in negotiations with about 15 councils - including Kingston-upon-Thames, Aberdeen and Cheshire East - to bring PooPrints to the UK.

The company believes local authorities can use new powers granted by the Antisocial Behaviour and Policing Act 2014 to force dog owners to comply.

Gary Downie, Streetkleen's managing director, told The Times said an order could be imposed with the condition that any dog using a particular public area must be DNA registered

Such registration, which involves swabbing the animal's cheek for a sample, costs about £30 and could be done at the same time as microchip implantation, he suggested.

'If you want to use a local park or canal towpath to exercise your dog, it seems reasonable to ask you to add its DNA to a database. Responsible dog owners have nothing to fear from this technology,' he told reporter Ben Webster.

In the U.S. the technology has already been in use for several years, mainly in controlled, gated communities where access is only open to residents.

Using a designated PooPrints collection kit, groundskeepers and apartment managers gather any evidence and send it off to PooPrints parent company, BioPet Vet Lab in Knoxville, Tennessee.

There scientists test the DNA against all registered dogs to determine if a particular pile comes from one of a community’s dogs.

It’s billed as a money-saving way for groups to cut down on excess excrement, protecting the environment and shoe soles alike.

Under the proposals, dog owners would have to register their pets' DNA with the local authority 

Opinions of the service, which requires upfront fees from resident dog owners and sometimes monthly fees thereafter, aren’t all positive.

Dallas tenant Brian Barcus, speaking last year, said he was unhappy with his building’s decision to contract with PooPrints.

‘Everybody wants to live in a clean community,’ he told the Houston Chronicle. ‘I can see the intent behind the new rule, but I don't understand how they can force it upon us in the middle of our lease.’

Others, such as property managers, see it as a good way to keep their grounds clean.

‘I think it's a great idea,’ Houston-area leasing manager Molly Kalish said. ‘The main reason we decided to try this new program was because we had a specific issue on one of our floors with accidents.’

Back in Britain, Ken Moss, the councillor responsible for parks at Hyndburn Council, told The Times the technology would be most effective if the government were to introduce a national DNA database.

'The beauty of it is that there's no escape for the selfish owner,' he said.
