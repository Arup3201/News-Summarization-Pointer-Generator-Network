Professor Patrick Pullicino, a leading neurologist who has criticised plans to ask every ill or elderly person if they want to die at home or in hospital 

A plan to draw up a ‘death list’ of how every ill or elderly person wants to die has been criticised as a dangerous and worrying idea.

The influential Commons Health Select Committee yesterday called for a new database listing whether people would prefer to die at home or in hospital.

They said two-thirds want to spend their final days at home – but half still die in hospital. A register of preferred options would help to stop this happening, MPs on the committee said.

But Professor Patrick Pullicino, a leading neurologist, said the plan simply perpetuates the ‘central flaw’ of the discredited Liverpool Care Pathway.

The professor, who was the first senior doctor to expose the failures of the LCP three years ago, said such a register carried huge risks.

Those who wished to die at home might be denied essential care, said Professor Pullicino, a consultant neurologist with East Kent Universities NHS Foundation Trust. He also said it was not possible to know when a person will die.

The LCP was abolished last July following several examples of ‘shocking’ abuse, many of them unveiled by the Daily Mail.

Many families complained that their relatives were sedated with a ‘chemical cosh’ then killed by the removal of food and fluids, leading Care Services Minister Norman Lamb to denounce the LCP as a ‘national disgrace’.

Professor Pullicino said the latest plan risked making the same mistakes.

‘This predication of a specific line of treatment on a prognostication of imminent death that is not evidence-based was the central flaw of the LCP and is perpetuated in this report.’ 

Research into the question of how to diagnose imminent death accurately was ‘completely absent from the list’ of priorities in the report, he added. The doctor said the danger was particularly acute for those with dementia.

Around two-thirds of people want to spend their final days at home – but half still die in hospital (file picture) 

The report was also criticised by Dr Tony Cole, chairman of the Medical Ethics Alliance, a pro-life group of medical organisations. ‘There have always been difficulties in predicting imminent death,’ he said. 

‘A patient at the end of life may also have a treatable condition which could be relieved. People making their own end of life plan may not have foreseen this.’

The MPs’ report says most people who express a preference say they would like to die at home but this was made difficult by disparate community palliative care services. 

Sarah Wootton, of Dignity in Dying, the assisted suicide lobby group, said there was ‘a real need for greater information and support for people approaching the end of life to enable them to plan ahead’.
