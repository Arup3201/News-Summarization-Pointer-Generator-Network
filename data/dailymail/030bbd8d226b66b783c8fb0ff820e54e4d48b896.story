Women from the north of England are more likely to be diagnosed with the deadliest form of skin cancer than their southern counterparts because of sunbeds and cheap holidays abroad, a study has found.

Rates of melanoma - the most lethal form of cancer - had previously been highest in affluent areas of the 
south where the hours of sunshine are longer, according 
to research published today in the British Journal of Dermatology.

But cases in women aged between 10 and 29 have drastically risen in the north west of the country - with experts blaming young women's overuse of sunbeds to try and look like their favourite celebrities.

Research
leader Sarah Wallingford, from the University of Manchester's Institute
for Inflammation and Repair, says the findings suggest that 
affordability of holidays to warmer climates has been important factor 
in changing the regional discrepancy in melanoma rates.

The study examined diagnoses of melanoma over eleven years from 1996 to 2006.

Researchers at the University of 
Manchester also found that the disease was found to be most prevalent 
among the second most deprived socioeconomic group as well as the second
most affluent groups.

Nina Goad, of the British Association
of Dermatologists, said: 'This study is interesting as it changes our 
views on two important risk factors for skin cancer – where we live and 
how rich we are.

'Latitudinal
position in England has long been associated with risk levels for skin 
cancer, with southern regions always having the highest rates of the 
disease. But for young women, the disease is now highest in the North 
West.

'We know that across England, use of 
tanning beds is highest among young women in the north and is also high 
among lower socioeconomic status groups, so this may well be a strong 
contributing factor to both these findings.

Previous
figures have always shown melanoma to be more common in affluent people
who can afford to fly abroad to warmer countries.

These new findings suggest that holidays abroad becoming more affordable for everyone has contributed to those with lower incomes being diagnosed with the disease. 

Researchers at the University of 
Dundee found that 90 per cent of sunbeds in the UK emit radiation that 
is higher than the safety standards set by the EU.

The
World Health Organisation has stated that sunbeds are as lethal as 
cigarettes and they are listed as one of the most dangerous, 
cancer-causing habits.

Cases
of malignant melanoma - the deadliest skin cancer - have doubled in the
last decade, according to figures from Cancer Research UK.

Around 13,000 Britons are diagnosed with the illness each year and it causes 2,800 deaths.

Research
has previously found that a using a sunbed before the age of 35 
increases the risk of malignant melanoma by nearly 90 per cent.

Under pressure: Nicola Roberts, pictured far right with her Girls Aloud bandmates in 2004, said she became obsessed with having a tan

Former Atomic Kitten star Liz McClarnon, from Liverpool, is just one of many celebrities who has admitted to using sunbeds - which significantly increase the risk of melanoma - and since spoken out about the shocking impact it's had on her skin.

The 32-year-old gave up using sunbeds
ten years ago, now opting for fake tan, but by then a lot of damage had
already been done.

Ultraviolet images taken of the singer's skin showed UV damage beneath the surface of her 
skin with experts warning she will suffer from liver spots in years to come because of tanning sessions in her youth.

After viewing the image, Ms McClarnon told The Sun: 'I’m worried much of the damage has already been done — the picture looks like an old woman.

'There are so many freckles you can’t see. I had already noticed a change in the pigmentation on my hairline.

'Apart from the risk of skin cancer when I look at that picture I’m just thinking, "I don’t want to look like that old woman".'

Girls
Aloud singer Nicola Roberts, from Lincolnshire, has also previously 
admitted to being a 'tanorexic'. She mainly used fake tan but admits she
tried sunbeds - only giving them up as they gave her more freckles.

Self-confessed former tanorexic: Nicola Roberts, pictured with computer generated skin damage ahead of a TV show The Truth About Tanning, has called for sunbeds to be banned for under 18s

The singer, who spearheaded a 
campaign to ban sunbeds for those under 18, told The Sun: 'I was 
obsessed. If I didn’t have fake tan on I felt like death warmed up. The rest of the girls were lovely and bronzed.

'I used them [sunbeds] a couple of times but it would just burn me and give me freckles.

'Thank God it didn’t make me go golden brown. I dread to think of the position I’d be in now.'

It comes after a survey carried out by Cancer Research UK earlier this year revealed that 45 per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds who use sunbeds are unhappy with their bodies.

The study also revealed that 30 per cent of people who use sunbeds do so to look more attractive.

Eight out of every ten of these unhappy sunbed users claim that they feel pressurised to look different – 29 per cent said they were influenced most by peer pressure, 30 per cent said they were influenced by celebrities, and 45 per cent said it was the media that made them feel pressurised to look tanned.

By contrast, the research revealed that only 36 per cent of young people who have never used a sunbed are unhappy with their appearance.

Caroline Cerny, senior health campaigns manager at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘We live in an image-obsessed culture and know many sunbed users continue to use them because they think they look better with a tan.

‘But actually they are making their skin look worse in the long run. The more unhappy they are with the skin they’re in, the more they may use sunbeds – it’s a vicious circle.

‘Sunbeds can result in premature ageing and wrinkles, as well as increased pigmentation on the skin.

‘No one wants to look older before their time, and crucially, using sunbeds also increases the risk of skin cancer.’

Other recent research found that a ten minute session on a sunbed is twice as likely to cause skin cancer as spending the same amount of time in the midday sun in the Mediterranean.
