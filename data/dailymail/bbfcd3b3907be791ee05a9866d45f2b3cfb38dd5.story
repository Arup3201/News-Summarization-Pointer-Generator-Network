David Moyes suffered more misery at the hands of Villarreal on Sunday night as the club that once denied his Everton team a place in the Champions League gave him his first defeat in Spain.

Moyes Everton were robbed back in 2005 in Champions League qualifying when Pierluigi Collina wrongly ruled out a Duncan Ferguson goal. There was no injustice here however as Villarreal ran out 4-0 winners.

Real Sociedad had won one and drawn two of Moyes' first three games in charge and had not conceded a goal but the solid start unravelled at the Madrigal.

After a convincing first half display in which they limited the home side to just one real chance spurned by Uche, they were well beaten in the second half.

First, captain Bruno scored from a free-kick that came back off the underside of the cross bar and went over the line off goalkeeper Enaut Zubikarai's back-side.

Then winger Deni Cheryshev, who is on loan from Real Madrid and who has already been capped by Fabio Capello at international level, scored the second.

The impressive Russian made the third for Moi Gomez, who then added a fourth on 85 minutes to complete the rout.

It could have been even worse for Moyes with Luciano Vietto hitting the base of the post twice. 

Moyes already knew the size of the task he faces in Spain and against Europa League side Villarreal he saw the gulf in class between his players and those of rival coach Marcelino.

He now has a week to rebuild confidence ahead of the Basque derby next Sunday against Athletic Bilbao, followed three days later by a tricky second leg cup tie against third tier Oviedo who drew the first game at home 0-0.

Real Sociedad midfield Esteban Granero said: 'We need to start planning for the derby. It's always one of the games of the season so we have to learn from this but put it behind us.'
