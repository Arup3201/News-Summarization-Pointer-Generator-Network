A new range of jeans hopes to freshen up wardrobes everywhere with their scented denim.

The trousers come in five washed-out neon shades - blue, pink, green, orange and yellow. And each pair smells of its corresponding-coloured fruit; blueberry, strawberry, apple, orange and lemon.

Sold by Portuguese fashion firm Salsa, a pair of so-called Fragrance Jeans could be yours for just £55, and shipping is free.

Thanks to innovative technology, microcapsules release the fruity scent for up to 20 washes

Allowing you to not only look awesome but smell great too, so-called Fragrance Jeans are infused with temporary fruity smells.

The pastel-coloured jeans have microcapsules embedded into the fabric, which is created from a cotton and elastane blend.

Thanks to innovative technology they release their scent over time, meaning wearers can enjoy smelling good even if they neglect to wash their jeans.

Pink smells of strawberry for up to 20 washes, while orange carries a tangerine scent

The jeans retain their fruity fragrance for up to 20 washes, say Salsa.

That
 means even if you wash them every three days, that's almost three 
months of fruity fragrance - ensuring you're wearing the freshest jeans 
around for all of summer.

The Fragrance Jeans come in the brand's signature Colette cut - a medium rise waist and skinny leg trouser.

These blue jeans smell of blueberry while the green pastel skinnies smell of a zesty Granny Smith, say Salsa
