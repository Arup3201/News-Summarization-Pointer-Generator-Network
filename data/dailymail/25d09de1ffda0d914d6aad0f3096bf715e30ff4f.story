In 1909 Queen Victoria had been dead for eight years, her successor Edward VII was on the throne and World War I was still five years from starting.

That year also saw the birth of Evelyn and Edith in Scotland, the world's oldest surviving twins, who will celebrate their 104th birthdays on Friday.

However the sisters, who live in the same retirement home, may have to spend it apart as one of them is in hospital.

Edith, the older of the two sisters 
by 90 minutes, is currently recovering from a operation 
after she broke her hip.

Her son Nathaniel Ritchie explained that major celebrations at the Bonnyton Care Home in Ellon, Aberdeenshire, where the twins live together, are on hold until his mother returns there.

Nathaniel, from nearby Mintlaw, said: 'My mum is doing really well. We were worried when she broke her hip. The doctors said there was no choice but to operate but we were told there were risks for someone of her age.

In the early part of the 20th century Ernest 'Biggie' Shackleton was attempting to reach the South Pole, the Panama Canal started construction and future Poet Laureate John Betjeman had just been born

'Others younger than her had been refused the procedure because their hearts were not strong enough. Obviously hers is.

'She is just waiting for a special bed to be delivered to Bonnyton so that she can go back there.

'If it doesn't arrive before the birthday, we'll be taking a cake with 'Happy 104th birthday' on it into hospital.'

Through the course of their life the ladies have seen artist Picasso produce his finest work, watched as silent film star Charlie Chaplin rose to fame and witnessed DH Lawrence's book Lady Chatterly's Lover scadalise England.Â 

They have also lived through both World Wars, watched men walk on the moon and seen the coronation of our Queen, Elizabeth II.

After the passing of their husbands the sisters helped to look after one-another and as Evelyn's eyesight failed Edith, who puts her longevity down to hard work and a bowl of porridge every morning, started reading the paper to her.

Evelyn married William Middleton and had four children, 12 grandchildren, 26 great-grandchildren and three great-great grandchildren.

Edith married Nathaniel Ritchie and had four children, nine grandchildren, 21 great-grandchildren and three great-great grandkids.

Evelyn's daughter Eveline, 83, from Cruden Bay, said: 'My mum and her sister just get on with life. They really are amazing.'
