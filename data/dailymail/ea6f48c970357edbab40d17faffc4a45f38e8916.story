FIFA president Sepp Blatter has admitted that it was 'a mistake' to choose Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup.

Blatter said that the technical report into Qatar's bid had warned that it was too hot but despite that, FIFA's executive committee had voted for the Middle Eastern country.

However, despite his admission, the FIFA chief will not change the World Cup's destination, instead he will force through plans to run the 2022 tournament during the Qatari winter.

And the winner is: Blatter names Qatar as the winning hosts back in December 2010

Owning up: FIFA president Sepp Blatter says it was a mistake to award Qatar the 2022 World Cup

The temperature in Qatar between May and September ranges between 30CÂ  and 50c with humidity of 90 percent.

The area also suffers sandstorms during the dry season.

In December and January, Qatar can be hit by rain showers, although the temperature will drop to mid to the mid 20s.

Protestors believe that Qatar's human rights record and stance against homosexuality should preclude it from hosting the tournament.

Speaking to Swiss television, Blatter claimed it was 'probable' that the tournament would be moved to the winter.

In an interview with RTS he said: 'Yes, it was a mistake of course, but one makes lots of mistakes in life.

'The
 technical report into Qatar said clearly it was too hot but the 
executive committee - with a large majority - decided all the same to 
play it in Qatar.'

Blatter 
denied that Qatar had 'bought' the competition while acknowledging the 
bidder had spent a great deal of money on sponsorship and development 
programmes.

He added: 'No, I have never said it was bought, but that it was due to political considerations.'

Later,
 a FIFA spokesman clarified Blatter's earlier comments reiterating that 
Qatar was still going to host the 2022 tournament.

A
 statement claimed: 'As explained in his answer to the journalist, the 
president reiterated that the decision to organise the World Cup in 
summer was an "error" based on the technical assessment report of the 
bid, which had highlighted the extremely hot temperatures in summer in 
Qatar.

'At no stage did he question Qatar as the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.'
