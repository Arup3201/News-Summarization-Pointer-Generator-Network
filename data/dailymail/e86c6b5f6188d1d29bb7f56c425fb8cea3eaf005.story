They are widely condemned by parents for drinking, taking drugs and getting into trouble with the law.

But celebrities like Justin Bieber could actually have a positive influence on British teenagers' behaviour, according to a new study.

Researchers found that most young people view star's lives as a form of modern 'morality play' - filled with a cast of heroes and villains.

They learn lessons of greed, excess and insincerity from 'bad celebrities', whose public demise actually discourages them from bad behaviour and substances such as drink and drugs.

Meanwhile, they perceive 'good' stars as prime examples of how hard work, talent and modesty pay off. 

The 18-month study was carried out on 24 groups of British children, aged 14 and 17, by experts at Manchester and Brunel universities, according to The Sunday Telegraph. 

It found that today's celebrities serve a vital
'social function' that was previously delivered by religious or mythical 
figures, such as Jesus Christ, Judas and Zeus.

Among the UK celebrities considered 'bad' and 'famous for nothing' were Canadian singer Justin Bieber and reality television star Kim Kardashian.

Bieber was arrested on suspicion of drink driving and drag racing in January and is currently being investigated for an alleged attempted robbery, while Kim gained worldwide fame through her reality television series, Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

Meanwhile, Harry Potter actress Emma Watson and Olympic diver Tom Daley were perceived by teenagers as 'good' and 'real'.

The CelebYouth study, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, included a number of discussion groups and interviews, as well as research on social media sites like Facebook.

Lead researcher Dr Heather Mendick, of Brunel University in London, told the newspaper: 'There is the idea that young people just want to get rich quick by going on reality TV or becoming a "wag".

'But what they want to do is earn money in a way that is worthwhile so that they feel that they deserve the money.'
