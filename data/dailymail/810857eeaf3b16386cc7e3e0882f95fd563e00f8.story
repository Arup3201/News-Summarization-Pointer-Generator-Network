This tiny hedgehog lost a large chunk of her spines when she fell down a drain filled with cleaner and was burned.

But after some tender loving care at a wildlife hospital, Vera is back in good health again.

Les Stocker thought that the tiny hedgehog would remain partially bald but after a few weeks of care her spines started to grow back.

Recovery: Without her spines to keep her warm, Vera was left shivering. However, they have now begun to grow back

Massages: Vera was named by staff after the soothing Aloe Vera gel that is rubbed on her skin

Staff at Tiggwinkles, in Haddenham, Buckinghamshire, have been massaging her twice a day as she is nursed back to full fitness. Vera was named by staff after the soothing Aloe Vera gel that is rubbed on her skin.

Mr Stocker, founder of Tiggwinkles, said: 'When, eventually, she was out of the drain the shock was having no spines at all on her front end with only her rump being normal.

'The bald skin seemed to have been attacked with almost an acid. Perhaps inadvertently drain cleaner had got to her.'

After Vera was rescued last month she was washed and dried with a warm towel. But having lost her spines she was so cold that she went straight into her heated pen.

Massage: Vera has been rubbed down with Aloe Vera gel twice a day since she was taken to the Buckinghamshire rescue centre

Tender loving care: Vera has been slowly nursed back to health over the last few weeks and could be released back into the wild in the next two months

Recovery: Vera, seen here receiving treatment, can be seen as her front spines begin to grow back

The hedgehog quickly got used to her very hands-on care.

'Twice daily Vera soon took to relishing that Aloe Vera massage,' Mr Stocker said. 'She even stayed relaxed and started unrolling as she grew to love the pampering.

'Her skin looked healthy but I was unsure if she would ever regrow her spines. Then just after Christmas a short stubble appeared.

'Every day since we have seen more proper spines emerging.Â  Give her a couple of months then she will be able to be released back in the wild.'

Recovery: Vera's spines here can be seen slowly growing back. Staff said they began to appear shortly after Christmas

Growback: Vera, who is being nursed back to health, is expected to be released into the wild within two months

Resting: Vera was named by staff after the soothing Aloe Vera gel that is rubbed on her skin

Transformation: This sequence of pictures shows how Vera's spines have gradually grown back over the last few weeks

Recovery: Vera, who was rescued from a drain, is expected to be released back into the wild within the next two months

Spiky: Vera the hedgehog has quickly had to get used to some very hands on care
