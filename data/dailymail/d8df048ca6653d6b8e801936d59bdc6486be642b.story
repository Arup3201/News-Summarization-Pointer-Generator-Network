Valencia manager Nuno has heaped praise on Cristiano Ronaldo, labelling him 'the best player in history' ahead of his side's match against Real Madrid on Sunday.

According to Spanish newspaper AS, the former Porto goalkeeper - who took over as Valencia manager in July - has welcomed Madrid to the Mestalla with maximum praise for the Los Blancos star.

'He's the best in history, a perfect machine,' Nuno said of Ronaldo. 'But fear not, we are not afraid. That word does not exist in football. We think we can beat any opponent and we also have a strong dynamic at home.'

'Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player in history' reads the front page of Spanish newspaper AS on Sunday

Valencia sit fifth in La Liga after 16 games, but go into Sunday's crunch clash off the back of two straight league wins.

Madrid, though, are on another level entirely. They have won 22 matches in a row since a 2-1 away loss to Atletico Madrid in September. They are top of the league with a game in hand, but despite this, Nuno believes his Valencia side do have a chance against Carlo Ancelotti's men.

'We have played some very good games and one of those ended in victory. The key is how we face every game. You have to play every ball as if it were your last and fight hard. It will be a good match.'

Elsewhere in Spain, there is some focus on David Moyes' Real Sociedad hosting Barcelona and Luis Suarez on Sunday evening.

Both were in the Premier League last season, and Mundo Deportivo touch on a 'morbid reunion' between the two at Anoeta.

Claudio Bravo is Mundo's main story, with the Barcelona keeper returning to his former club. The Chilean spent eight years at Sociedad, making over 200 appearances for the Spanish outfit.

Real Sociedad boss David Moyes faces a tough test in keeping up his club's impressive record against Barca

He returns 'with some statistics that threaten the record' that Sociedad have over Barcelona. Last season, Sociedad won 3-1 at Anoeta, while the season before that they won 3-2. In 2011, there was a 2-2 draw... in fact, Barcelona have not won away at Sociedad since 2007. 

'Marca' claim that all eyes are on Mestalla, in a match that signals 'a great start to the year.' They cite a hard January for Madrid, beginning with a tie against an in-form Valencia.

Ancelotti's side face Valencia, Atletico Madrid twice - in the Copa Del Rey - Espanyol, Getafe and Cordoba before the start of February.
