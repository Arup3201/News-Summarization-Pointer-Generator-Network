Hundreds gathered to honour poet Seamus Heaney as he was laid to rest in his native Bellaghy, south Derry.

A requiem mass was held in Dublin this morning, attended by U2’s Bono and senior members of Sinn Fein, before the immediate family travelled 125 miles to his home village.

Locals began filling up the graveyard of St Mary's parish church in the morning hours to get an opportunity to bid farewell to the Nobel Price winner.

Hundreds of locals gathered to pay their respect to the world famous homegrown talent as he was buried on Monday night

United: Following a requiem mass in Dublin this morning, the immediate family travelled 125 miles to Seamus Heaney's home village

Earlier today, his son revealed that the Nobel laureate's last words to his wife were 'don't be afraid'.

Michael Heaney told the congregation, which included rockstars, writers and politicians, that his father made the moving plea to wife Marie via a text massage in Latin moments before he died.

Michael spoke briefly at the end of the service to thank those who cared for his father, who died on Friday aged 74, and those who have offered support and praise since his death.

'His last few words in a text message he wrote to my mother minutes before he passed away were in his beloved Latin and they read - "nolle timere" ("don't be afraid"),' he said.

Among those packing the pews of the 
Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart for his funeral were Irish 
government leaders, poets and novelists, Bono and The Edge from rock 
band U2, and former Lebanese hostage Brian Keenan.

Ireland's
foremost uilleann piper, Liam O'Flynn, played a wailing lament before 
family members and friends offered a string of readings from the Bible 
and their own often-lyrical remembrances of the country's most 
celebrated writer of the late 20th century.

The legendary wordsmith won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1995.

Mourners at his funeral were led by his widow Marie and children Michael, Christopher and Catherine Ann.

Chief celebrant of the Mass, Monsignor Brendan Devlin, opened the service with the remark that Heaney might have liked to have his funeral celebrated by someone with a Northern accent. 

Condolences: Marie is consoled by a member of the congregation. It was told during the service the poet was held in such high regard by people from all walks of life

He summed up why the poet was held in such high regard by people from all walks of life.

'He could speak to the King of Sweden, an Oxford don or a south Derry neighbour with the directness of a common and shared humanity,' he said.

A posy of flowers from the garden of the Heaney family home in Sandymount and a book of some of Heaney's works were offered as gifts during the service.

The Mass was ended with a reading of one of Heaney's poems, The Given Note, from his second published collection.

Paul Muldoon, a teacher, poet and friend of Heaney, gave the eulogy following the service.

'We remember the beauty of Seamus Heaney as a bard and today in particular in his being,' he said.

Michael Heaney, one of the poet's 
sons, spoke briefly to thank those who cared for his father and those 
who have offered support and praise since his death.

He revealed that his father had sent a text message to his mother, Marie, last Friday.

'His
last few words in a text message minutes before he passed away in his 
favourite Latin were 'nolle timere' ('don't be afraid'),' he said.

Irish
President MIchael D Higgins, himself a published poet, attended along 
with Taoiseach Enda Kenny and former president Mary McAleese and her 
husband Martin.

Heaney will be buried this evening in his native Bellaghy in Co Derry - a village that inspired so much of his work.

'A gift to the world': Former US president Bill Clinton (pictured with wife Hillary) has been among those paying tribute, describing Heaney as 'our finest poet of the rhythms of ordinary lives' and a 'powerful voice for peace'

His
lifelong friend and poetry contemporary Michael Longley were among the 
mourners, along with musician Paul Brady and U2 stars Bono - with his 
wife Ali Hewson - Edge, Larry Mullen and Adam Clayton.

Heaney has been hailed as the greatest poet Ireland produced since William Butler Yeats.

Former
US president Bill Clinton has been among those paying tribute, 
describing Heaney as "our finest poet of the rhythms of ordinary lives" 
and a "powerful voice for peace".

A
hastily arranged celebration of the poet's life in Belfast's Lyric 
theatre on Saturday night was packed to capacity as the audience was 
treated to poignant recitals of his best known works.

Books of condolences are open in Derry, Belfast and Dublin.

Mr Kenny has said it would take Heaney himself to describe the depth of loss Ireland felt over his death.

The 1995 Nobel prize-winner was born in April 1939, the eldest of nine children, on a small farm called Mossbawn near Bellaghy, and his upbringing often played out in the poetry he wrote in later years.

The citation for the award praised Heaney "for works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past".
