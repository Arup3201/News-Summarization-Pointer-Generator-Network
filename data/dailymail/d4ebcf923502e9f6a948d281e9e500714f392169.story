It is not known for its swathes of white sand or constant sunshine – and it can be a little uncomfortable for bare-footed paddlers.

But despite its pebbled shoreline, Brighton has been named among the world’s best cities with beaches.

Also on the elite list drawn up by Lonely Planet are the arguably more glamorous Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town, Barcelona, Miami, Sydney and Dubai.

Tourist attraction: Sunbathers line the seafront at Brighton, which has been named alongside exotic destinations like Rio and Miami in a list of the world's best beach cities

Ipanema: Rio's beaches boast white sands rather than pebbles, and a view of Sugarloaf Mountain rather than Brighton Pier

In an online feature, the guidebook company says: ‘The beach is made up of pebbles, not sand, but that doesn’t stop the crowds heading here in their droves.

‘Whether it’s midday sunbathing or midnight partying, Brighton beach seems to be in use at all times.

‘Brighton is the most vibrant seaside resort in England. Just an hour from London, it is a thriving, cosmopolitan city with a Bohemian spirit; home to an exuberant gay community, a dynamic student population and a healthy number of ageing and new-age hippies, as well as traditional candyfloss fun.’

According to tourist chiefs in the East Sussex city, nearly three quarters of visitors take in the beach as part of their trip.

Yesterday might not have been  the best day to do so however, with temperatures falling below zero. Visitors to Cape Town would have basked in 25C.

Geoffrey Bowden, of the Brighton and Hove economic and culture committee, was delighted with the city’s new accolade.

‘For the city’s beaches to be placed alongside those of Rio, Sydney and Barcelona shows the unique positioning and branding we have achieved globally as a tourist destination,’ he said.

The list was drawn up as suggested destinations for travellers unable to decide whether to have a city break or beach holiday.

Barcelona is described as Spain’s most cosmopolitan city where the ‘largely artificial’ beaches attract seven million bathers every year. The final three cities included were  Tangier, Valencia and Tel Aviv.

A recent guidebook to Great Britain published by Lonely Planet described the country as being full of overpriced restaurants, poor quality tourist attractions and expensive hotels.

It claimed the country ‘has had its day’ and even natives can no longer afford to holiday at home.

Pebbly: The stony shore at Brighton is a far cry from the white sands of Rio or Miami, but that doesn't deter sun worshippers in the summer months

Iconic: Sunbathers cool off on Bondi beach in Sydney, where temperatures today reached a record breaking 45.8 degrees Celsius

Glamorous: Miami beach, Florida, a favourite haunt of celebrities including Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian

Beach activities: Kite surfing at the coast in Tel Aviv, Israel, which also made the Lonely Planet's list of brilliant beach cities

Sea breeze: Sun seekers can enjoy balmy temperatures even in winter months at the beach in Tangier, Morocco

Viva Espana: Blue skies over the beach in Barcelona, Spain - one of two Spanish cities to make the list

Exotic: Tourists enjoy camel rides across white sands in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, which was named in the Lonely Planet list

Sun, sea and sangria: The Spanish city of Valencia, one of the country's many tourist hotspots, was named among the brilliant beach cities of the world by the Lonely Planet
