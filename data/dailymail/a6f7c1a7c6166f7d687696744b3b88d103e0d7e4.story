When most people Google themselves (oh, come on, we've all done it) they find their Facebook page, their Twitter account and their LinkedIn profile.

Not British fashion blogger Poppy Dinsey, who Googled her own name and discovered personal holiday photos of herself in swimwear being used on an American porn website.

Miss Dinsey - a 25-year-old Londoner who runs the popular style blog What I Wore Today (wiwt.com), in which she and the site's users post daily photographs of their outfits - said seeing the images made her feel 'annoyed' and 'helpless'.

Speaking to MailOnline, Miss Dinsey said: 'It's one of the problems of having an unusual name: anyone can Google you and find out so much about you.

'The photos weren't being used in a pornographic way and they weren't even sexy images - just me in a cafe - but they were still on a porn website. It made me feel really powerless, and frightened for my reputation.

'It's not like it was a scorned ex-boyfriend and a sex tape, but when you're trying to build a name for yourself online....I just didn't want people to think I was just another girl trying to get into topless modelling.'

She added: 'My boyfriend at the time found it very funny, but I was really annoyed I felt really helpless.'

And
when the site jumped from the sixth page of search results to the 
first, Miss Dinsey decided to put a stop to it, keen for people to know 
that she hadn't put the photos there herself.

The influential blogger contacted the host company in America and the site was closed due to copyright infringement.

'The tricky thing was that the photos were of me and I hadn't taken them, so I didn't officially hold the copyright.

'Just because you're in a photo, it doesn't mean you own the copyright. I think a lot of young people don't know that.

'It's difficult to fight for photos of you to be removed from sites - and that's quite scary.

'That's the reason I always take the photos of myself on my blog; so it's obvious that the copyright for all the photos belongs to me.'
