She was one of the first people to advocate the hot-right-now vegan lifestyle and has a best-selling cookbook, It's All Good, so it makes perfect sense for Gwyneth Paltrow to launch a cookbook club.

The mother-of-two, who is known for her strict diet and rigorous exercise regime, is encouraging her Goop followers to start their own foodie book clubs, just as she and her pals have done.

Writing on her lifestyle blog, the 40-year-old said: 'This was not my idea. The cookbook club. Which is probably why it’s so good.

Foodie fan: Gwyneth Paltrow has just started a cook book club with her friends and shared some of her favourite recipes from this week's tome on her Goop

'While I have always liked the idea of a book club (sorta) I am just not that type of gal. Until one of my gorgeous girls suggested we do a different book club of sorts. A cookbook club! Now, as someone who gets in bed and reads cookbooks cover to cover as if they were novels, this idea was scintillating.'

Gwyneth, 41, says when she her girlfriends set up their club and sought the perfect first cookbook, they searched for 'something challenging, beautiful, and with the possibility of becoming a classic'.

The actress says she chose Roberta's Cookbook, by Brooklyn-based chef Carlo Mirachi, because it's full of 'challenging' and 
'inventive' 
recipes that she and her friends would probably never have attempted at home until pushed.

And
how right she is. What on earth is 'maltagliati and sungold tomato'? 'Smoked sablefish, meyer lemon, cucumber, English muffin' sounds equally perplexing. And we're not totally sure if Sainsbury's stock sea urchin either, so that's another recipe out.

However, it's encouraging to see there are plenty of comforting carbs among the famously healthy actress's six recipes, including 'maltagliati', a type of pasta from the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, linguine, English muffins and pappardelle duck ragu.

Readers may be shocked to see that Gwyneth, also includes a recipe for - shock, horror! - fried chicken.

Gwyneth did recently admit that you should always allow 
yourself a few treats - so perhaps a homemade KFC is hers.

'I often have a glass of red 
wine in the evening and smoke a cigarette on a Saturday. I love those 
moments because they are just the right amount of naughty,' she told The Telegraph.

'That balance 
keeps you vibrant. You have to live your life, after all.'
