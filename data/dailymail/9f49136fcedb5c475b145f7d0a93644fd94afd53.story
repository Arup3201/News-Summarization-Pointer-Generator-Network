Suge Knight has released graphic photos of his injured torso following an attack at a VMA pre-party in which he was shot six times.

In one of the pictures five bullets holes can be seen in the rapper's back along with a large surgical wound where doctors opened him up to check for organ damage.

In another picture the sixth wound, on the 49-year-old's arm near his tattoo commemorating Tupac, is visible after being stuffed with gauze.

Suge Knight has revealed pictures of his wounded torso after he was shot six times at a party hosted by Chris Brown. Pictured, five bullet holes are visible on the rapper's stomach along with a surgical scar where doctors opened him up to check no organs were damaged

Knight was shot five times in the torso and chest and a sixth time in the arm during an attack at a pre-VMA party in an LA club hosted by Chris Brown

Together: Chris Brown was hosting a VMA pre-party when Knight was attacked, and police say the gunman targeted his victim contradicting earlier reports that Knight had stepped into the line of fire

Fortunately surgeons say none of his organs were harmed during the assault, according to TMZ.

Knight returned home from hospital on Wednesday as reports surfaced that investigators areÂ  looking at several 'people of interest' whose names or street monikers had come up in interviews, the New York Daily News reported.

The images were released a week after investigators said footage taken inside the LA nightclub where the attack took place shows Knight was targeted by the gunman.

Knight, 49, was shot at an album release party hosted by Chris Brown at 1Oak in West Hollywood in the early hours of Sunday.

Two others, including 19-year-old model Megan Hawkins, were shot at the pre-VMA party and all three were rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

'Video
 shows the suspect with a handgun firing at Knight [and] striking the 
two other victims who were in his vicinity,' Los Angeles County 
sheriff's Lt. John Corina told CBSLA.

After firing, the suspect started running for the exits alongside partygoers.

Corina added that he did not know if the two other victims, Hawkins and a 33-year-old man, were targeted. All three victims were expected to recover, authorities said.

Other video taken outside the club apparent show the music producer being led to a waiting police car by an armed officer as an ambulance arrives at the scene.

Sources
 claim he calmly 
walked outside and asked a cop for help before he was rushed to 
hospital.

Roads
 around the nightclub were immediately sealed off by police, as the 
nightclub was evacuated, with several partygoers detained for 
questioning.

On Monday, Knight's family issued a 
statement which read: 'The family of Suge Knight asks that you keep Suge
 in your prayers and to stray away from the negativity portrayed by the 
media.

'Suge is currently resting and has lost a lot of blood, he's 
human. He's done a lot of things for the community and the culture as a whole so we ask that you respect that.'

Knight, the co-founder of Death Row Records with Dr. Dre and the rapper The D.O.C., is no stranger to the effects of gun violence.

His friend Tupac Shakur was shot multiple times during a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in 1996 - although during a previous visit to 1OAK, Knight told reporters that no one had ever been charged with Shakur's murder because he wasn't really dead, and was instead living on an island.

Knight also suffered a gunshot wound to the leg during a shooting at a 2005 pre-VMA party, hosted by rapper Kanye West.

In the moments after the gunfire, 
Brown was seen climbing onto a bar in the nightclub, apparently angrily 
remonstrating with other clubgoers as a bouncer told them to 'Get down'.

At around 5:45 a.m. LA time, Brown tweeted about the incident.

'It's
 disappointing that we as a society can#t have fun or enjoy ourselves 
without any altercations sometimes. Miss me with the bullsh*t!!!' he 
tweeted.

The Los Angeles branch of 1OAK - which stands for One Of A Kind - is a spin off of the New York club, while there are further branches in Las Vegas and Mexico City.

The club, which bills itself as 'Bringing a New York nightclub experience to Los Angeles' has been open on the famous Sunset Strip since the start of the year and has proved popular with many celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Rihanna.
