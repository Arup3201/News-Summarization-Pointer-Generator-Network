An Italian clothing manufacturer has been accused of sexism after selling fashion items complete with washing instructions reading: 'Give it to your mum - it's her job'.

Politician Federica Mazzoni, who works at the equality commission at the legislative assembly in the country's Emilia-Romagna region, was incensed when a friend bought a cardigan for her son from the Shoeshine clothing brand and found the offensive label.

Ms Mazzoni, 28, has now lodged a formal complaint with Italy's advertising council the IAP - although the company that distributes Shoeshine clothing, Unipersonale, has dismissed the controversial washing instructions as 'a simple joke aimed at teenagers'.

No joke: Beneath a list of ordinary washing instructions Democratic Party MP Federica Mazzoni found the English language instruction: 'Or give it to your mum, it's her job'

Beneath a list of ordinary washing instructions including 'Machine wash cold' and 'Do not dry clean' the Democratic Party MP found the English language instruction: 'Or give it to your mum, it's her job'.

Posting a photo of the label onto Facebook, Mazzoni wrote: 'Doing the washing is not the mother's job, fathers are also capable of turning a simple knob.

'Obviously it wasn't enough for the company to provide all the necessary useful information, it felt the need to have its say, by perpetuating a sexist message about mothers and women, which is also insulting for men and fathers,' she added.

'It suggests women have no other skills than staying at home and that of turning a knob to 30...In a mirror image, it insults men as if they were not capable of doing a simple wash.

'Anyway, the cardigan is still in the wash basket.'

Ms Mazzoni was joined in her criticism by Facebook friend Erica Zambonelli who posted: 'If one did not see it, one would not believe it. Crazy.'

But Lorenzo Genovesi posted: 'It could be morally harmful for kids. Although I wonder how many youngsters will look at the label, as they probably leave it to their mums.'

Responding to accusations of sexism, Shoeshine distributor Unipersonale dismissed the claims.

'There is no kind of sexist irony. It's just a simple joke aimed at teenagers who are our target,' the company said, a spokesman told Tgcom24.
