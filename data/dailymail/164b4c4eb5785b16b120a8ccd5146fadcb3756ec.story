While caviar, velvet and concrete manicures may have been hot beauty news in 2012, this year is all about feather nail polish.

The feather effect polish doesn't launch in stores until next week but the latest creation from nail masterminds Nails Inc is proving to be so popular that one polish sold out just 12 hours after it was unveiled online yesterday lunchtime.

Available in four shades, the £11 polish features tiny feather like particles blended in a range of pastel shades that create a feather like effect on the nails.

From McQueen to Marchesa, feathers have 
been all over Couture creations lending a whimsical and feminine 
elegance to the lines of the designs and once again, Nails Inc are ahead of the game in beauty trends.

After
 Alexa Chung's Nails Inc leather polish went on to sell out in seconds, the brand are unveiling a whole host of exciting nail launches this year.

'Keep an eye out for what’s coming next – another first to market 
textured polish launching in April - denim.'

Famous fans of textured nail varnish 
looks include Blake Lively, who wore velvet nails on her wedding day 
with Ryan Reynolds, Rihanna, Katy Perry and, of course, fashion muse 
Alexa Chung.

Beauty blogger Charlie Lankston added: ‘People
 have become really adventurous with their nails and are taking every 
opportunity to experiment with different nail art, colours and textures 
and the new Nails Inc selection is the perfect way to add another 
exciting element to your everyday manicure.

‘Having
 pioneered the magnetic nail trend, it’s no surprise to see Nails Inc 
upping their game in terms of new and unique textures.

'The
 feathery finish is perfect for those looking to decorate their nails 
with a beautiful texture and pattern without the hassle of a salon 
visit.

'The ideal at-home luxury for all beauty lovers.’
