The FIFA ethics report into World Cup bid corruption is expected to blame England more than Qatar for breaching regulations when it is published on Thursday morning.

Judge Hans-Joachim Eckert’s long-awaited conclusions, after an investigation carried out by New York lawyer Michael Garcia over two years, effectively clears Qatar to host the 2022 tournament while pointing the finger of suspicion firmly at England’s 2018 bid.

This will cause consternation within the FA, who considered their campaign the most transparent of the lot, and ensure relations with the world governing body remain at rock bottom for years to come.

Lord Triesman was FA Chairman from 2008-10 and 2018 CEO Andy Anson led the bidding process

The Russian and Australian bids are also expected to be criticised more than a Qatari campaign that has been the focus of so much controversy.

England’s transgressions, expected to be listed in the Eckert summary of Garcia’s 430-page findings, were widely regarded as insignificant compared to the multi-millions spent by Qatar on securing the World Cup, which is now having to be moved to winter because of the stifling heat there in the summer.

Yet although Eckert will name and shame former FIFA ExCo members Jack Warner and Mohamed bin Hammam, who have already left all their football posts and, in Bin Hammam’s case, been banned from the game for life, there is no major criticism attached to Qatar’s 2022 campaign. 

Qatar have insisted from the start of the scandal that Bin Hammam played no prominent role in their campaign.

There are understood to be at least two significant references to England breaking the bidding regulations in Eckert’s summary, centering around failed attempts to woo Warner.

The biggest rogue in the FIFA gallery promised Prince William and Prime Minister David Cameron that he would vote for England, then reneged.

Eckert is expected to detail the £35,000 sponsorship by England 2018 of a gala dinner in Trinidad during the Caribbean Football Union summit in 2010 — part of the regular business of the CONCACAF confederation run at that time by Warner.

And Eckert is also expected to mention the hosting by England 2018 of a UK training camp in the summer of 2009 for the Under 20 Trinidad and Tobago federation team who had links with Warner.

An FA spokesman said: ‘We strongly refute any suggestion of impropriety by those involved in the England bid.’

Russia, who will host the next World Cup in 2018, are admonished for a lack of co-operation with the FIFA investigation, including ‘losing’ emails relating to their bid.

The report by US attorney Michael Garcia is set to clear Qatar to host the World Cup

Garcia was not allowed to enter the country because he is on a list of people barred as a consequence of a human rights dispute between the US and Russia.

Meanwhile, Qatar has come under fire from Amnesty International, who claim the Gulf state’s efforts to prevent the abuse of migrant workers have been negligible.

Qatar said in May it would implement reforms to address conditions for migrant labourers, many of whom are helping to build stadiums for the 2022 World Cup.

But Sherif Elsayed-Ali, Amnesty’s head of refugee and migrant rights, said: ‘Time is running out fast. Urgent action is needed to ensure we do not end up with a World Cup that is built on forced labour and exploitation. The steps taken so far are woefully insufficient.’
