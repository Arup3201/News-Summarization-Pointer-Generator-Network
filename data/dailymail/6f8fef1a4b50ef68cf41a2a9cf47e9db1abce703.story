A man whose skull was smashed to bits in a horrific lawnmower accident has had it replaced using an implant created with a 3D printer.

Michal Lesiow, 31, from Kutna, Poland, was taken to hospital with grass, mud and bone fragments in his shattered skull after the rotary lawnmower ran over his head as he cut grass outside his house.

He can't remember how the accident happened, and said: 'All I recall is that I woke up in a ditch with a cracking headache, like I'd been punched or hit by a car.

Michal Lesiow, 31, is lucky to be alive having received a 3D printed skull implant after an accident with a lawnmower left him out cold in a ditch

'The police were there and told me not to move and then an ambulance turned up.'

When Mr Lesiow got to hospital he was told he was missing part of his head.

Dr Pawel Kolasa, head of neurosurgery at the hospital in Lodz where Mr Lesiow was taken said: 'The patient had massive trauma to the skull with a hole showing part of the brain.

'He was lucky to have survived.'

Surgeons at Lodz hospital, Poland, carefully fitted the 'printed' skull implant which had been created to exactly fit the gaping hole

The exact shape of the skull implant was created out of polypropylene by the printer

Dr Kolasa called upon fellow surgeons Professor Marcin Kozakiewicz and radiologist Dr Martin Elgalal who have spent the last two years developing 3D printing applications for bone reproduction.

They took a 3D scan of Mr Lesiow's head, and then recreated the missing part of his skull from polypropylene, using the 3D printer.

Using this method, the replacement skull is exactly the right shape to fit the gaping hole where the shattered bone was removed.

Doctors first took a 3D scan of Mr Lesiow's head to get a multidimensional image of the missing area of skull

Information from the 3D scan is fed into the 3D printer, which the begins to build the skull implant from layers of special plastic

Dr Kolasa and fellow surgeons Professor Marcin Kozakiewicz and radiologist Dr Martin Elgalal have spent the last two years developing 3D printing applications for bone reproduction

'We have obtained very good artistic and aesthetic effect and, more importantly, permanent protection of the brain,' said Dr Kolasa.

'I've still got a cracking headache, but at least I'm still alive and look pretty normal all things considered,' Michal said.
