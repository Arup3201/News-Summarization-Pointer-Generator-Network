A man whose pregnant partner was killed by his two pit bull-type dogs had threatened social workers with one of the animals months before the death, a court has heard.

Mother-of-four Emma Bennett, 27, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, died after she was attacked by the dogs called Bella and Dollar at her home last December.

A previous court hearing was told how epilepsy sufferer Emma may have suffered a fit which could have led the two dogs to see her as prey.

Pregnant Emma Bennett was killed by her two dogs at her home in Leeds. Lee Horner threatened to set one of the dogs on two social workers who visited the house in July last year a court heard

Lee Horner, 34, admitted owning dogs prohibited by the the Dangerous Dogs Act at Leeds Magistrates' Court.

A district judge heard how two women social workers visited the house in July last year and Horner told one of them: 'Shut it or I'll set the dog on you.'

Prosecutor Vincent O'Malley told the court that Horner told the other social worker, who was eight months pregnant at the time: 'What you looking at? Wait until I get the dog and see if you continue looking at me like that.'

Mr Malley described how Horner was out when police arrived at the house he shared with Miss Bennett in December after being alerted by neighbours who heard a noise they first thought was an argument.

He said Miss Bennett was heard to shout: 'No, no, no.' The two officers went inside after getting no response.

Neighbours heard Miss Bennett shout: 'No, no, no' when officers went inside after getting no response at the home in Leeds. The found her hanging off the sofa and the dogs had blood around their mouths

Mr O'Malley said: 'They were met by the two dogs - Bella and Dollar. Both had blood on their snouts and appeared excited.

'They noticed drops of blood in the doorway and on the carpet and went into the living room. There, they saw Emma Bennett lying motionless on the floor. Her legs were on the sofa.

The dogs were examined by experts and found to have sufficient characteristics to be a banned breed of pit bull type dogs. File picture

'She had extensive injuries, particularly around her facial area and her head.'

The prosecutor said the officers performed first aid on Ms Bennett and they found both dogs 'excitable but not aggressive' as they did this.

Miss Bennett was taken to hospital but did not survive, Mr O'Malley said. Emma was pregnant with her fifth child.

The dogs were examined by experts and found to have sufficient characteristics to be a banned breed of pit bull-type dogs.

When Horner was interviewed by police he confirmed joint ownership of the dogs and said he bought Dollar 12 to 14 months previously, believing he was a 'Staffy'.

Bella was given to Horner by his brother approximately four months prior to the incident after her original owner found her to be too excitable.

Horner told police that Bella would sleep with him and Emma.

Deputy District Judge Tim Spruce said he will decide this afternoon whether to sentence Horner today or whether to order a pre-sentence report.

After hearing from Narinder Rathour, defending, how the death of his partner has affected the defendant, Mr Spruce has already ruled out a prison sentence.

Horner, who has 39 previous offences but none relating to dangerous dogs, has suffered from anxiety since the death of his partner and  has difficulty sleeping.

Mr Spruce decided to adjourn the case for a pre-sentence report to be prepared. He told Horner he will be sentenced at the same court in early July.
