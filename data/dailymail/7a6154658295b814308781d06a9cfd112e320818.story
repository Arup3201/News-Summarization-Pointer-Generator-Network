Tragic: Mark Wood, 44, was found dead at his home in Bampton, Oxfordshire, on August 9 last year

An Asperger's sufferer with a phobia of food died after his benefits were cut following a nationwide Government crackdown on handouts, an inquest has heard.

Mark Wood, 44, was found dead at his home in Bampton, Oxfordshire, on August 9 last year - four months after he had been declared fit to work.

His body was discovered in a decomposed and malnourished state, weighing just 5st 8lbs.

Mr Wood, who lived alone, had suffered from Asperger's syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as a range of phobias, including those of pollution, paint, food and certain social situations.

He had been receiving housing benefit and employment support allowance from the Government after being signed off from work with sickness.

But in January last year, he was deemed fit to work by Atos heathcare, which assesses people on behalf of the Government's Department of Work and Pensions (DWP).

The decision saw Mr Wood's benefits stopped in April - leaving him with just his disability allowance to live off.

In following months, his body mass index plunged to 11.5 - much lower than the 'healthy' 18.5 to 24.9 - while his phobia prevented him from spending his remaining money on food, the inquest heard. 

Mr Wood's GP told Oxfordshire Coroners' Court that his patient was a 'vulnerable' individual who was unfit for work.

Doctor Nicholas Ward, from the Bampton Medical Practice, said: 'He was an extremely vulnerable and fragile individual who was coping with life.

'Something
 pushed him or affected him in the time before he died and the only 
thing I can put my finger on is the pressure he felt he was under when 
his benefits were removed.'

Dr Ward added that he had not been contacted by either Atos or the DWP about Mr
 Wood’s medical history, and revealed that if he had been asked for his 
professional opinion, he would have said his patient was unfit for work.

Mr Wood’s mother, Jill Gant, from 
Abingdon, told the inquest she had sent £250 to her son before he died on August 9 - 10 days after he was last seen.

'By then it was too late, he was so fragile and unstable,' she said. 'We didn’t realise how bad things were.

Decision: Mr Wood passed away four months after he was deemed fit to work by Atos healthcare, which assesses people on behalf of the Department of Work and Pensions. Above, the DWP office at Caxton House

'He found it difficult to accept help from his family because he tried to live independently so he gave the £250 away. He had a lot of problems but he was very gentle and sweet.'

She added: 'Extreme stress and lack of money caused
 by the removal of his benefits led to his eating problems.'

Pathologist
 Doctor Clare Verrill told the court a BMI below 13 could prove fatal - but added that Mr Wood's cause of death had not been established because his body had decomposed.

Recording a narrative verdict, coroner Darren Salter said: 'Mr
 Wood had an eating disorder and food phobia. It is likely that this 
caused or contributed to his death as he was markedly underweight and 
malnourished.

'I accept the evidence about something pushing him over the edge heard from GP Mr Ward.

'On the other hand, we do know cash was provided prior to death, but because of his phobias he didn’t use that cash to buy food.'

Speaking after the inquest, Ms Gant said she and her relatives had arranged to meet Oxford West and Abingdon MP Nicola Blackwood to try to find out why Mr Wood was declared fit for work.

Atos healthcare spokesman, Tessa David, said: 'Our thoughts are with the family of Mr Wood at this difficult time.

'We carry out the Government’s Work Capability Assessment as professionally and compassionately as possible.'

DWP
 spokesman, Ann Rimell, added: 'A decision on whether someone is well 
enough to work is taken following a thorough assessment and after 
consideration of all the supporting medical evidence from the claimant’s
 GP or medical specialist.'

Government figures show that, between October 2010 and March 2013, more than 1,000 
people across Oxfordshire stopped receiving employment and support 
allowance benefits.

Suzy 
Drohan, joint manager of Barton’s Oxfordshire Welfare Rights, said: 'It 
is terrible, I’m really concerned about how Mr Wood has fallen through 
the cracks.'
