A killer who murdered his wife has been granted legal aid to fight for custody of her four children. 

The man, known only as X, is serving a life sentence for the 'particularly horrible' murder of the children's mother and has refused to have a paternity test to prove he is their father.

Judges at the Court of Appeal upheld a decision that DNA collected from the murder scene could not be used to prove paternity, so the issue of his and his family's access to the children - aged between three and nine - will be decided without this evidence.

Court of Appeal judges ruled that DNA collected from a crime scene when a man murdered his wife will not be used to prove he is the father to their four children - despite his refusal to take a paternity test - as he receives legal aid to fight for custody of the youngsters who are aged between three and nine 

The case began when the local authority and children's legal guardian challenged the decision by Theresa May, the home secretary, and the police not to allow the DNA to be used to prove paternity, the Sunday Times reported.

The man is not named on any of the children's birth certificates.  

Sir James Munby, president of the family division of the High Court, initially allowed the application and ruled that the DNA could be used to determine paternity. 

He said: 'One cannot ignore the enormous implications for these children of what happened to their mother.

'Their futures will be indelibly marked by it. They need to know if the man who murdered their mother, the man who they believe to be their father, is in truth their father.' 

But after the ruling was challenged the Court of Appeal overturned Sir James Munby's decision. 

The man, who is referred to only as X, has refused to have a paternity test to prove he is the children's father

The judges said allowing evidence gathered from the crime scene to be used would damage the integrity of the DNA database.

David Green, director of Civitas, a think tank, branded the case 'extraordinary.' 

He added: 'For the sake of the long-term care of the children and the feelings of the wife's family he should not be allowed any continuing role in their upbringing.'
