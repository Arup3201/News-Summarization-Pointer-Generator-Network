Jonathan Brownlee won the battle of the brothers as he led home Alistair to win the World Triathlon Series in Stockholm on Saturday.

The Englishman won in a time of 57 minutes and 31 seconds, with older brother Alistair a close second - nearly 50 seconds in front of German Gregor Buchholz who came home in third.

Spaniard Javier Gomez, who is so often the closest rival to the Brownlee brothers, failed to finish the course.

That gives Jonathan Brownlee, who finished second behind Alistair at last month's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, a direct shoot-out between himself and Garcia at the Edmonton Grand Final in Canada on September 1 as both bid for the 2014 world title.

The younger Brownlee said: 'Stockholm is a great course; that was a great race. It was perfect.

'I wanted to win as this season has not gone as well as I'd hoped.

Alistair meanwhile, who is out of the title race, told BBC Sport: 'It was absolutely perfect. We gave it everything we could.'

USA's Sarah Groff won the women's race in a time of in one hour three minutes.
