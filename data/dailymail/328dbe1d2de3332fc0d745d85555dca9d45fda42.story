Unhappy: Holly-Mae Donaldson, 13, was sent home from her school in Cheltenham because her skirt, above, was made of banned 'stretchy' material

A 13-year-old schoolgirl was sent home on the first day of term because her skirt was ‘too stretchy’.

Holly-Mae Donaldson, a pupil at All Saints Academy in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, had to go home yesterday because her skirt conflicted with the school’s uniform code.

The skirt, which was not too short, was deemed unacceptable because it was made of a banned ‘stretchy’ material.

Rules for girls say all skirts must be knee-length without splits or pleats, and not stretch.

But Holly-Mae has also accused the school of singling her out, as she said other girls wear the exact same skirt but were not punished.

She said: ‘I really think it’s pathetic. It’s just the material, and it doesn’t affect my learning. I felt singled out by the teachers, and it’s only the first day of school.

‘I know other girls who have the same skirt as I do, but they haven’t been told they would be put in isolation or sent home.

‘I really enjoyed going to school at the start, but late last year, the teachers seem to be thinking more about uniforms.’

Her mother Diane Donaldson said the decision was ‘appalling’ and that it was almost impossible to find a skirt for her daughter which complies with the rules.

‘I couldn’t believe it when the school called me up. How is the skirt too short, when it goes to her knees?’ she said.

‘They told me it was made of stretchy
material, and not acceptable. I spent the entire summer holidays trying
to find one to fit her as she is so small.

‘Now
they’ve told her they would let her return if she wears the same 
trousers which they said last year were unacceptable! It’s really a case
of double standards. I just don’t understand it.

‘The school really needs to concentrate more on the education, and less on the pupils’ uniform. I think she is old enough and sensible enough to decide what she wants to wear to school.’

As well as Holly-Mae, All Saints Academy sent two other students home on their first day for having inappropriately dyed hair.

The school, which an Ofsted 
inspection this year said 'requires improvement', has been criticised 
before for sending home a student for wearing the wrong shoes, even 
though he had broken his toe the previous day.

Principal Peter Kingham said: ‘We have been very clear with our students about uniform expectations.

‘We have demonstrated what is acceptable and what is not. We have had assemblies on this and written to parents.

‘The academy has high standards which we are intent on maintaining. We have a parents’ forum where issues such as this can be raised and we encourage parents to join this.

‘Alongside this, we have a procedure for any complaints from parents that we encourage them to follow whenever necessary.

‘Out of 1,000 students in the academy, the vast majority adhere to our policies and practices and accept them fully.’
