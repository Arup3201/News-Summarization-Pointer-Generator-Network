Sea The Moon, a short as 3-1 favourite for next month’s Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe in the aftermath of his spectacular 11-length German Derby win in July, has been retired.

It emerged on Saturday that an injury he suffered in Germany’s premier Classic had re-surfaced when suffering a first career defeat at Baden-Baden earlier this month.

That was enough to rule the colt out of the Arc at Longchamp race on October 5.

Now it has ended the career of a colt who has been sent to Newmarket to receive treatment.

Sea The Moon’s exit from the stage means the colt showered with praise by jockey Christophe Soumillon after his German Derby success will never have a chance to prove if his spectacular win was as phenomenal as it looked.

The Queen’s 2013 Ascot Gold Cup winner Estimate, successful in the Doncaster Cup last week, has joined the attractions who will gallop up Newmarket’s famous Warren Hill Trial grounds at Newmarket’s Open day on Sunday, starting at 9.30am.
