A new miniskirt stewardess uniform for a Japanese airline that 'barely covers' female airline staff has been condemned by a cabin crew union.

Skymark's royal blue outfit was launched last week and the length of the dress has drawn criticism with the Japan Federation of Cabin Attendants saying it is unsuitable for the work performed by cabin attendants, which includes stretching high up and kneeling down.

The uniform was introduced to mark the airline's announcement that it would begin fly 10 Airbus A330-300s for the first time on its Haneda-Fukuoka flights this spring.

A new miniskirt stewardess uniform for a Japanese airline that 'barely covers' female airline staff has been condemned by cabin crew union

Skymark's royal blue outfit was launched last week and the length of the dress has drawn criticism with the Japan Federation of Cabin Attendants, saying it is unsuitable for the work performed by cabin attendants, which includes stretching high up and kneeling down

Comments posted on the union’s website said attendants would not carry out their duties effectively owing to fears about leering stares or customers shooting pictures up their skirts with a mobile phone.

In a statement on its blog the union claimed: 'Article 73-3 of the Civil Aeronautics Act states ‘prohibition of safety-impeding acts,’ which includes sexual harassment. The duties of cabin attendants are to prevent these (incidents) beforehand, but we are concerned that the design of the uniform might induce such disturbing acts,' reported The Japan Times.

'Moreover, (Skymark) is treating women as products, as it is advertising that this uniform will attract customers.

'We have to doubt the morality of the company, which should make safety its number one priority,' it said.

The group claimed that the new mandatory uniform for females will means employees will need to be careful about being secretly photographed, distracting them from their jobs

The federation said it has received comments from cabin attendants, although it is not clear which airlines they work for.

A Skymark spokesman said the carrier is not treating women as products.

He said the uniform does not affect the safety of the plane, and that the firm has not directly received complaints from the federation.

The airline said the miniskirt uniform will only be used during the six-month campaign period by employees on the A330

The airline also said the miniskirt uniform will be used during the six-month campaign period.

Last year flight attendants on the Australian airline 
Qantas complained that it is too sexy, impractically tight, and unflattering.

Speaking about the Martin Grant-designed
 uniforms - which Qantas ambassador Kerr, 30, first modelled in April - 
one domestic short-haul flight attendant told Australia's Daily Telegraph: 'The uniforms are really tight and they are simply not practical for the very physical job we have to do.'
