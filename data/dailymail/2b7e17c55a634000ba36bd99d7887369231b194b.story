A previously unheard Michael Jackson track set to be released on the singer's forthcoming posthumous album is about child abuse.

The new song, entitled Do You Know Where Your Children Are, tells the story of a 12-year-old girl who runs away from her abusive stepfather and turns to prostitution.

It is one of eight tracks recorded by the singer before his death in June 2009 at the age of 50 which will feature on the new album Xscape, set to be released in May.

New release: A previously unheard Michael Jackson track set to be released on the singer's forthcoming posthumous album Xscape is about child abuse

In one of the song's verses Jackson sings: 'She wrote that she is tired of step-daddy using her/Saying that heâ€™ll buy her things, while sexually abusing her,' according to the Daily Mirror.

According to leaked lyrics from the chorus, the song continues: 'Do you know where your children are? Because it's now twelve o'clock/If they're somewhere out on the street just imagine how scared they are.'

The track includes the line: 'Save me (from this living hell) Save me (cause I don't wanna know)', and fans of Jackson have speculated that it was written in response to abuse claims made against the singer.

Lyrics: In the song, Jackson sings: 'She wrote that she is tired of step-daddy using her/Saying that heÂ¿ll buy her things, while sexually abusing her'

Not guilty: Jackson, pictured leaving the Santa Barbara County Superior courthouse with his father Joe, was acquitted of sexual abuse charges in 2005

In the mid 1990s Jackson was accused of sexual abuse by the family of a 13-year-old boy Jordan Chandler.

The case was settled out of court for about $25 million and no formal charges were brought against the singer.

In
 2005, Jackson was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse 
allegations and several other charges after a jury in Santa Maria, 
California, found him not guilty on all counts.

Album: Xscape, comprises of a collection of tracks 'contemporised' by L.A. Reid and a team of producers, including Timbaland (pictured)

Dancer Wade Robson is suing Jackson's estate after claiming that he suffered sexual abuse over several years at the hands of The King Of Pop.

In 2005, Robson was a key witness who 
helped clear Jackson of molestation charges. However, he has since 
claimed that he gave the favorable testimony after 'brainwashing' by the
 singer.

A hearing is due to take place in June.

The new record, Xscape, comprises of a collection of tracks recorded before the singer's death and 'contemporised' by Epic Records boss L.A. Reid and a team of producers, including Timbaland.

Jackson's estate provided Reid with unlimited access to four decades worth of material by the singer, resulting in the new album, due to be released on May 13.

'Michael left behind some musical 
performances that we take great pride in presenting through the vision 
of music producers that he either worked directly with or expressed 
strong desire to work with,' said Reid.

'We are extremely proud and honored to present this music to the world.'

The
 name XSCAPE is a nod to the late singer's favoured naming process of 
picking one of his songs to name his record after, in this case the 
title track which was written and originally produced by Jackson and 
Rodney Jerkins.

A Deluxe 
Edition of the record will also be released which will include all of 
the sourced Michael Jackson recordings in their original form.

Jackson's
 last studio album was his 10th and final record Invincible, which was 
released in 2001 and featured singles You Rock My World, Cry and 
Butterflies.
