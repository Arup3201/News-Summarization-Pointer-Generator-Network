Wayne Rooney and his Manchester United team-mates were celebrating on Sunday night after they beat Liverpool to move five points clear of their rivals in the race for Champions League football.

Juan Mata scored both goals, and captain Rooney took to Twitter to congratulate his team-mate on his 'great goals'.

The England skipper also admitted that he should have let Mata take United's penalty, which would have secured his hat-trick on an impressive afternoon at Anfield.

'Very happy tonight,' Rooney said on Twitter. 'Fans were amazing. @juanmata8 great goals. Should of [sic] let him take penalty. And the United fan in the kop. Brilliant.'

The 29-year-old's comment about a United fan in the Kop refers to pictures appearing to show a rogue away supporter spotted holding a Manchester United scarf aloft among Liverpool's most staunch fans.

An image appearing to show the man sticking his tongue out during the home fans' rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' circulated widely on Twitter.

However, it later emerged that Rooney, like many others, was actually the victim of a Photoshop hoax.

During the game, Rooney's decision to step up and take the penalty himself proved to be the wrong one as he saw his effort saved by Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet.

Mata had already grabbed a brace and a third goal would have completed a magical afternoon for the Spaniard, whose goals eventually proved enough to secure the win.

After a goal in each half for the away side, Liverpool halved the deficit when Daniel Sturridge pegged a goal back.

United managed to hold on for the win though, leaving Rooney and his colleagues celebrating their position three points closer to next season's Champions League.
