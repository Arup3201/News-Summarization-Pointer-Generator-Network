Tragic: Bennett Rill, 14, and his friends were trying to climb on to the roof of a school in Fairfax County, Virginia

A teenager died after being electrocuted trying to help his friend who had been shocked by a live wire on a school fence.

Bennett Rill, 14, and his friends were trying to climb on to the roof of a school in Fairfax County, Virginia.

His friend fell to the ground after receiving a strong electrical shock and Bennett's parents believe their son became entrapped in the wiring as he scrambled to help his friend.

The straight- A student was climbing Fox Mill Elementary School on Tuesday shortly before 9 p.m. with three friends, when the accident happened.

The parents of the 15-year-old who was with Bennett told the Washington Post that their son felt 'pins and needles' throughout his body as he scaled the building.

He then received a strong electrical shock and was blown off.

He fell 10 to 12 feet to the ground and the other boys rushed to help the teen, who was unconscious.

Bennett became entangled in electrical wires and was electrocuted, they said.

Bennett was pronounced dead at the scene.

The three other teens between the ages of 14 and 15 were taken to Inova Fairfax Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

At least two of the three have now been discharged from the hospital.

Bennett’s father says he is not surprised his son came to the aid of a friend.

'He helped me teach Sunday school,' said Derick Rill.

'Some of it was for getting the [community service] hours, but after he had gotten the hours, he kept coming.

'I’d ask him if he’d like to go with me in the morning, and several times he did it without even blinking. He wanted to go.'
