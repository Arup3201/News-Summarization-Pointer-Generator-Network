This public toilet is clearly not for everybody desperate to spend a penny.

The local council has been flooded with complaints from larger locals who say they are unable to get through the 20-inch doors to access the facility.

Authorities in the city of Chengdu in southwest China's Sichuan province, said they decided to install the toilet there more than 20 years ago because of an urgent need for more public facilities.

But they claim it has only become more of a problem because people are now more overweight.

There is only enough space in the corridor for a single person to go in and out of the toilet at any one time, while queues can form during winter as people try to force themselves in while wearing thick jumpers and woolly coats.

Local council official Guang Yao, whose department operates the toilet, said they had decided to put the toilet there two decades ago because there was an urgent need for more public facilities but there was very little space.

He said: 'It was less of a problem then because people were not so overweight as they are now, and there was not so many people using it so they had time to come in and go out.

'We have tried several times to modify the toilet to make it more convenient but there really is not space to do very much, and we decided to leave it because it's better to have a facility that some people can use occasionally rather than nothing at all.

'The bottom line is that land is very scarce here in the district and our options are very limited.

'Because there are a lot of residential properties here in the area a lot of people walk past, and the toilet is in great demand even if it's not available to everyone.'
