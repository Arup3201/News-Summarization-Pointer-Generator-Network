Robredo overcame a blistering pace from Kyrgios to grind out out a 3-6 6-3 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 victory that leaves Casey Dellacqua as Australia's lone singles survivor at the final grand slam of the year.

Kyrgois produced some explosive tennis early on, but spaniard Tommy Robredo fought hard to send the 19 year old ace crashing back to earth with a third-round elimination at New York.

Kyrgios lit up Arthur Ashe Stadium and had former world No.1 Jim Courier gushing in the commentary box with a dazzling first-set blitz, but paid the ultimate price for underestimating Robredo's class and guile.

The 32-year-old last year ousted five-times champion Roger Federer, and two days ago rallied from two sets down to defeat Simone Bolelli in the previous round.

Not taking the court for their prime-time match-up until after 10 o'clock, Kyrgios started like a man trying to make a midnight flick.

Blasting the veteran off the court, the youngster led 5-0 after barely 15 minutes and secured the first set before many spectators had even found their seats.

'Oh my, it's showtime already,' Courier said after Kyrgios broke Robredo early in the second set and then held with a spectacular 45-second service game.

'This is really impressive stuff. This kid is having his way with last year's quarter-finalist.'

'Someone better go out there and ask him if he's even awake. This is what we call a dream-like state. This is the zone right now.'

'This is a tremendous athlete playing tennis and you're seeing the full arsenal.' said Courier.

But from 2-0 and three more break-point chances up in the second set, The Wimbledon quarter finalist lost his way, dropping his monster serve twice to allow the 16th seed back on level terms.

The third set went on serve all the way until a pivotal tiebreaker.

After trailing 3-0, Kyrgios recovered to lead 4-3 before losing his cool and smashing his racquet in fury after dropping both his next two points on serve as Robredo snatched the breaker and the set.

Bidding to become the first teenager in six years to make the men's last 16 at Flushing Meadows - and to also overtake Lleyton Hewitt as Australia's new No.1 - Kyrgios was unable to muster any fourth-set fightback.

Kyrgios was then broken to love on his first service game as Robredo charged to a 3-0 lead.

There were no more breaks back as Robredo served out the contest to love, after a staggering two hours and 28 minutes.
