Frank Lampard’s Champions League experience can help guide Manchester City to glory this season, believes Samir Nasri.

Chelsea's record goal scorer signed for new MLS outfit New York City FC this summer but will return to England on loan with Manchester City.

The move has proved controversial for many Chelsea fans but French midfielder Nasri believes Lampard's experience will prove invaluable to City.

Nasri said: ‘Frank’s a great player and any team will benefit from his experience.

‘We will particularly benefit from having him in the Champions League because that’s where we need to improve this year.

‘He’s won it and I think he can help us.

‘It’s good that he’s an English player too as we’ve had a little problem with that!’

Machester City have, so far, disappointed in the Champions League having never made it past the round of 16.
