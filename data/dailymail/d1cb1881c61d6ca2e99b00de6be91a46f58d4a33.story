Eugenie Bouchard, who has been embraced by tennis fans as the tournament’s 
sweetheart, is fast becoming the queen of SW19.

The
 20-year-old Canadian - named after the British princess by her royalist mother - 
took a step closer to being crowned queen of the court after beating 
22-year-old Romanian Simona Halep yesterday.

As she becomes the first Canadian woman to make it to a Grand Slam singles final, an adorable photograph of her as a schoolgirl has emerged.

Always a golden girl: Eugenie 'Genie' Bouchard, who has powered through to the Wimbledon Womens' finals, is seen smiling for her school photograph aged 12

The 
talented woman, who has powered through to the Wimbledon womens' 
finals, is seen smiling for a school photograph aged 12 and also grinning widely
 as an angelic six-year-old.

Eugenie 
and her sister Beatrice, who is six minutes older than her, were named after the British Princesses due to their mother's love of the royal 
family.

The girls both attended The Study All Girls School in Montreal, Quebec, up until the 
age of 12. '

Eugenie then moved to Florida where she was coached by tennis ace Nick Saviano before returning to her homeland in her mid teens.

Ranked 13th 
in the world, she said she was ‘not surprised’ that she had beaten world
 No.3 Halep yesterday, because she had worked so hard for it.

The
 player has acquired a loyal fanbase, dubbed ‘Genie’s Army’, since winning
 the Wimbledon juniors two years ago and has received countless offers 
of marriage on Twitter. Asked about the marriage proposals last night, 
she smiled: ‘There is always a chance that I’ll say yes over Twitter, so
 keep them coming.’ 

Her 
semi-final match was not without drama and it took six match points 
before Eugenie finally won, which she admitted was ‘a little 
stressful’. Her mother Julie Leclair said afterwards: ‘I was very 
nervous. Watching was a bit like going to the dentist but we are so 
proud of her.’ She has described her mother as a ‘royal nut’ 
who named all four of her children after the noble British family.

Eugenie's twin sister Beatrice and brother William are also named after members 
of the Royal Family, while younger sister Charlotte is named after 
Princess Caroline of Monaco’s daughter.

She said: 'Maybe it 
looks like my parents were royal obsessed, it makes me feel a little bit
 more at home in England among my fellow royals.

'When I was young my 
Mum gave me a magazine with the two princesses in it and I still keep it
 on my bedside table, my brother is Prince William. I think they are 
just nice names that they liked.'

William,
 15, who has attended all of his sister’s matches at Wimbledon this 
year, said: ‘It’s amazing. All of my friends can’t believe my sister is 
top in the tennis world.’

And
 Beatrice, who claims to have a telepathic link with her twin, said 
recently: ‘Every day I am just in awe. I have seen everything she has 
missed out on in childhood and teenage years. She has sacrificed a lot 
to get where she is today.’

Blonde Eugenie prepared for the tournament by pulling a weighted sledge 
across American football fields and jumping over hurdles. She also ran 
along sandy beaches in Florida, where she has been training since she 
was 12. ‘It’s getting really physical nowadays, the game, so you’ve got 
to be in top shape,’ she said.

In a post match interview she surprised her fans by revealing that she is a huge fan of singer Justin Bieber, but claimed that he would need to ‘clean up his act’ before she would consider dating him.

The
 Canadian tennis pro, who beat Simona Halep 7-6, 6-2 in the 
semi-finals and was WTA's Newcomer of the Year has proven she has a fun side off the court, too.

A photo of the Montreal-born 
tennis star and her twin sister Beatrice in a saucy fancy dress outfit has emerged - and it's a far cry from her sweet childhood snap.

Speaking yesterday, ahead of 
her first semi-finals at a grand slam, the 20-year-old Canadian said: 
'We keep in touch and she's a huge supporter. We're opposites but very 
close.'

Eugenie's tennis 
career started at the tender age of five and by the age of 12, she was 
living in Florida, where she was coached by Nick Saviano and became best
 friends with British tennis star Laura Robson.

Hollywood looks: And definitely not just a pretty face, as well as her sporting skills she once considered a career as a physician

Proving that she's not just a pretty 
face, she once considered a career as a physician and has made 
appearances on CTV's The Social and as a weather anchor on CTV Montreal.

With her Hollywood looks and dazzling talent she has amassed a global fan base, and at other tournaments adoring supporters often throw cuddly toys at her, 
although she says Wimbledon spectators are ‘too proper’ to behave that 
way.

Miss Bouchard is rumoured to be in a 
romance with Canadian ice hockey star Alex Galchenyuk, but keeps her 
tennis contemporaries at a distance.

She
 was close to British star Laura Robson, but it has cooled recently and 
Miss Bouchard said last month: ‘I don’t think the tour is the place to 
have friends.’

It is a 
clear sign of the single minded determination of the young woman who 
started playing tennis aged five in the English speaking Montreal suburb
 of West Mount.

She said: 'Ever since I was young, whatever I did I wanted to do it to the best of my abilities.

'When
 I came home from school I would be the one doing my homework while my 
siblings would be watching TV and putting it off until later.

Athletic: Eugenie's tennis career started at the tender age of five and she is already a star aged 20

‘I was always very determined, and to excel at this sport you have to be really disciplined and motivated.

'I asked my parents if I could play more so they put me in groups where there was more actual tennis and it went from there.

‘Nine is very young to decide what you want to do in life but that is pretty much when I decided.'

'Meanwhile my twin retired at age six. We are very close but opposite in many ways. I never needed to be pushed.'

She's a Belieber! Eugenie has admitted that Justin Bieber would have to clean up his act to win her over
