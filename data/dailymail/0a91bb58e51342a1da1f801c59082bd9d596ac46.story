Dozens of police weapons including submachine guns were stolen from a SWAT training building by thieves who allegedly cut through locked doors.

The 21 MP-5 submachine and 12 large-calibre handguns were altered to fire blanks, but they could be converted back to take live ammunition.

The unguarded building was considered secure, Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief Michael Downing told the Los Angeles Times.

‘I guess “secure” is all relative now,’ he said. ‘It's embarrassing - it's a lesson learned.’

The guns were moved on Wednesday night to a multi-storey building and stored in a locked box on the first floor, Deputy Chief Downing said.

The building is about a mile from SWAT headquarters. It was donated to the department and has no alarm or surveillance systems.

SWAT members were scheduled to train at the building on Thursday, but a police officer arriving at 9am found that the weapons were missing.

Thieves cut locks on an outside door and two inside doors and forced their way through a metal roll gate, Deputy Chief Downing said.

The building was openly used as a SWAT training site and sometimes public demonstrations were held there.

However, police have not ruled out the possibility that the theft might have involved police officers, he said.

‘You wonder if this was a planned operation, what information they had, whether they were conducting surveillance,’ he said.

Since the theft ‘appropriate measures’ have been taken, he said - without providing details. But regional law enforcement agencies have been told.

‘This is a big deal,’ Deputy Chief Downing said. ‘We're concerned. We want to recover them.’
