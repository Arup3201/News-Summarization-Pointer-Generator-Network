How about some Vegemite ice-cream with Weet Bix on top?

The ultra-Aussie confection is just one of the weird and wacky flavours being concocted by an adventurous, multi-award winning, ice-cream connoisseur.

Dooley's Ice Cream parlour in Apollo Bay, on Victoria's famous Great Ocean Road, is known for producing some of the oddest combinations in ice-cream - and its Vegemite flavour may be the strangest yet.

Owner Dooley Milner told Daily Mail Australia the flavour is a massive hit with international tourists and 'gets people talking'.

Dooley's Ice Cream Parlour on the Great Ocean Road has released a Vegemite flavour 

But others are not so keen, saying the black, salty yeast byproduct is not well suited to ice cream.

Dooley's, which has won 370 awards for excellence, often creates unique flavours in the run-up to special events.

Just before Christmas, Dooley's made a Xmas Pudding flavour and for Australia Day the shop made a Lamington flavour.

But it's Vegemite  that has stood the test of time. The parlour first introduced the unique ice-cream on Australia Day in 2011 and it has been on the shelves ever since.

In 2012, it won a silver award at the Royal Melbourne Show and the parlour's vanilla flavour has been voted the number one ice-cream in Australia at the Australian Grand Dairy Awards 2015.  

'I've stuck with it since. It has been received quite well.' Mr Milner said. 

The famous shop, which is visited each day by hundreds of tourists, has a range of odd flavours on display

76-year-old Dooley Milner has been running the parlour for the past 14 years and his daughter Alyciandra came on-board in 2007

'It’s a great point of interest with people coming in. They come in and they ask "can we try the Vegemite?", Mr Milner said. 

'They've never heard of it before, especially not in an ice cream.'

'Some say it’s too strong and some say it’s just right and come back and buy more.'

The shop is known for creating unique flavours for special occasions. This Lamington flavour was made available for Australia Day

The ice-cream parlour has won over 370 awards for it's range of different flavours

While Mr Milner said the ice-cream tastes of Vegemite, there have been some critics of the acquired flavour online.

A commenter on Reddit wasn't impressed with the potent flavour while others claimed they were desperate to try it. 

'Not good....the taste was too strong,' the user said. 

Another commenter was desperate to taste the flavour, telling other users he wouldn't mind if it's wasn't nice.

While people are eager to queue up to taste the unique product, there have been some critics of the Vegemite flavour online 

Dooley's owner Mr Milner said he will continue selling the Vegemite flavour ice-cream as it's a conversation starter among the many curious tourists who pass his shop everyday on the Great Ocean Road. The shop also sells strange flavours such as Xmas Pudding and Pavlova 

'I can't go the rest of my life without finding out what this tastes like. I won't even care if it's terrible. I have to try it,' the user said. 

Mr Milner said he will continue selling the Vegemite flavour ice-cream as it's a conversation starter among the many curious tourists who pass the shop.

'I think we’ll keep it going, we've always kept it going practically right from the start,' he said. 

'All the tour guides speak very highly of it and bring their travellers in and they try the Vegemite. It’s one of the talking points and also chilli chocolate and ginger.'
