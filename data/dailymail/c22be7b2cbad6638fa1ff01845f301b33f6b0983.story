Photographs taken moments before an aircraft crashed into a mountain killing two men have been published.

The pictures, taken from a video camera attached to the Pegasus Quik microlight, show 3,850ft Ben More in Scotland looming ever closer.

The aircraft ran into severe turbulence and crashed about 100ft from the summit in May last year.

The pilot David Martin, 63, from Kinghorn
in Fife, and his passenger Alan McCaskie, 62, from Broughty Ferry in 
Dundee, who owned the microlight, were killed in the accident in 
Stirlingshire.

Pilot and father-of-two David Martin had 12 years flying experience

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch released the pictures as part of a report into the crash.

It said: 'The severity of the turbulence created by
the wind, close to the summit of Ben More, was such that it exceeded 
the safe conditions for flight in the microlight.

'This resulted in a loss of control which led to the impact close to the summit of the mountain.'

The report said the video showed the flight path had been stable up to a point about 300 metres from the summit.

It went on: 'At this point the aircraft started to roll rapidly from left to right and pitched nose-down.'

The AAIB added that the increase in 
engine power 'suggests the pilot was trying to arrest his rate of 
descent and climb out of the turbulence'.

The
report said a witness on the top of Ben More saw the last moments of 
the aircraft's flight and had described the wind at the summit as 'very 
strong'.

When the witness removed an item of 
clothing from his rucksack it was nearly 'ripped' out of his hand by the
wind, the report said.

The 
report added: 'It is likely that, in this case, a lack of awareness of 
the wind conditions, and of the likelihood and severity of turbulence 
downwind of high ground were factors in this accident.'

Father-of-two Mr Martin had been flying for 12 years and was a member of the Scottish Aero Club in Perthshire.

Mr McCaskie, who was married with a son, joined the club in 2011 and was working towards his pilot's licence.
