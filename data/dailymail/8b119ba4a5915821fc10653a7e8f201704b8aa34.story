A video of a young George Osborne advising voters how to use ‘clever financial products’ to avoid taxes has been unearthed.

In the clip, recorded on BBC's Daily Politics in 2003, Mr Osborne smirks as he advises a caller to the show how to cut inheritance tax bills and avoid paying for old age care.

Mr Osborne even admits that he ‘probably shouldn’t be advocating this on television’.

A young George Osborne advising voters how to use ‘clever financial products’ to avoid taxes has been unearthed

 Mr Osborne said: 'There are some pretty clever financial products which enable you to - in effect - pass on your home, or the value of your home, to your son or daughter and then get personal care paid for by the state.

'I probably shouldn't be advocating this on television.'

The revelation comes amid an ongoing political row over tax dodging in the wake of bombshell allegations that HSBC helped wealthy individuals stash their money in its Swiss banking arm.

A list of thousands of British-linked individuals with bank accounts in Switzerland was leaked – including a number of high profile Tory donors.

Labour said the Government had turned a blind eye to tax avoidance – and accused David Cameron of being ‘a dodgy Prime Minister surrounded by dodgy donors’.

A party source said the video of Mr Osborne advocating ways to dodge taxes exposed the Conservative Party’s hypocrisy.

A Labour source said: 'We already knew that David Cameron and George Osborne were turning a blind eye to tax avoidance. Now we learn the Chancellor has been advising people how to do it.'

In the video Mr Osborne, who was a backbench MP at the time of the recording, hands out advice to a viewer called Bill.

Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna (right) said it was 'a matter of good housekeeping' to get a receipt for cash-in-hand jobs following Ed Balls's remarks

It comes after Labour's Ed Balls said tax avoidance was such a widespread problem families should make sure they get a receipt for all cash-in-hand jobs - even if they are only for £10. 

His remarks sparked accusations that he was out of touch with ordinary small businesses.

But the party's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said getting a receipt for all cash-in-hand jobs was a 'matter of good housekeeping' and was a 'good thing to do'.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the demand was 'absurd'.

Tory minister Iain Duncan Smith said Mr Balls's demand for people to get a receipt for someone charging £10 to trim a hedge was 'absurd'

He said: 'I don't think anybody in the country probably does that unless they sit down and they do it as part of a process; in other words, if you are employing somebody in which the objective is paying them cash as a process of your business, then of course I suspect most businesses do keep some kind of record, that's the right thing to do.

'But if you have a one-off payment for something and you pay cash, I shouldn't think anybody in the country does that necessarily ... what it exemplifies is Labour's complete lack of understanding about how business works and, actually, how people get by.'

He told BBC Breakfast: 'Here we have a man that would be the chancellor who is wandering around saying Big Brother is going to watch you carefully, that if you do any cash transactions and don't keep receipts, somehow they are going to punish you. I find that absurd.'

The shadow chancellor's comments came as Labour and the Tories engaged in furious clashes over tax dodging, with both sides complaining of smears.

As he was pressed on BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics about what constituted tax avoidance, Mr Balls said: 'The right thing to do if you are having somebody cut your hedge for a tenner is to make sure they give you their name and address and a receipt and a record for the fact that you have paid them.'

Asked whether he himself followed that rule, he said: 'Absolutely. That's because I am the shadow chancellor and I'm extremely careful about these things.

'Over my life, have I ever given people a tenner and not given a receipt for it? Probably yes.

But he had not done so 'since I have been involved in politics and Treasury matters'.

Mr Balls said: 'It's not your job to pay their taxes for them and I think most people you give a tenner to are not going to be VAT-registered.

'They've got the legal obligation to make sure they pay their taxes if it's that kind of transaction - but I think the sensible thing for anybody is that you've got a record of it and you've done it properly.'
