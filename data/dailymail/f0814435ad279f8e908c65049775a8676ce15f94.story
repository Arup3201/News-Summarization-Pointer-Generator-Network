Social networking site Twitter unveiled the latest expansion to its San Francsico headquarters Monday, surprising workers with a log cabin right in the middle of the cafeteria.

Twitter now occupies seven of the 11 floors in the 77-year-old SF mart building, and bought the 1800s homesteader cabin to go along with the cafeteria's forest theme. Â 

'We've used the notion of the forest as a nice tie-in with Twitter and its bird logo,' office designer Olle Lundberg told MarinIj.com.

The unveiling alco coincided with the 149-year anniversary of the day President Abraham Lincoln was shot - perhaps the most famous person to have lived in a log cabin. The president was born in a one-room cabin in Kentucky and Lincoln Logs, the children's building blocks, are named after him. The timing of the unveiling seems to have been a coincidence.

Mr Lundberg purchased the log cabin from a Novato, California contractor who salvages them from remote Montana ranches.

'We advertised them for a year and we pretty much got a lot of crackpot calls,' contractor Karl Beckmann said. 'When you think about it, buying a 100-year-old log cabin that has been exposed to the elements is not a very practical idea unless you're doing something exactly like what is being done here.'

While the price of the cabin was never released, Tech Crunch found a 'more down market version' selling for around $12,500.

The 20x20-foot cabin was reassembled in the cafeteria without its roof to add intimacy and a space for workers to eat lunch. The cabin was outfitted with booths and a center pillar with TV monitors and a coffee station.

'You can see the hand of the original craftsmen who built them,' Mr Lundberg said. 'It's kind of cool that cabins that were built sometime in the 1800s have now reappeared. The guys who built them are long dead, of course, but are sort of still here. I kind of like that.'
