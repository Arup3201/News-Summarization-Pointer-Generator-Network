A five-year-old boy has died after falling off a diving board while taking swimming lessons at his local pool.

Ian Freeman suffered massive injuries after he toppled from the board and fell ten feet on to the concrete area around the pool.

He had been on life support at an Orlando hospital for ten days since the accident which happened in front of his horrified mother on September 11.

The boy was part of a youth swimming and diving team that was training at the Lake Brantley High School facility in Orlando, Florida.

His parents Christopher and Lisa released a statement saying they would donate their son's organs so he could help others.

'It is the only positive we can draw from this experience and will help others in need,' they said in the statement.

They also said they were 'extremely humbled by the outpouring of support' from the local community and have set up a fund to honor Ian.

'Through this tribulation, we have seen the importance of having the support of our community,' the statement added.

'Our family, friends, and neighbors have helped us tremendously during this time. We cannot thank everyone enough for their kindness and generosity.'

Emergency: Ian was airlifted to hospital in Orlando on September 11 but died last Friday from his injuries

Ian was on a team that is run by the Patriot Aquatic Program, which rents the pool from the high school. He had climbed to the three-meter platform, but somehow plunged over the side.

Officials told WFTV the boy's legs broke the fall. The accident happened in front of coaches, lifeguards, parents and other teammates.

He was flown to Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children, and had been in critical condition since September 11. A hospital spokesman said he passed away on Friday.
