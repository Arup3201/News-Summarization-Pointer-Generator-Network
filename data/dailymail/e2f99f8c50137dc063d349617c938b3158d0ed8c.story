Chelsea go into their second leg against Paris Saint-Germain with a small advantage due to Branislav Ivanovic's crucial away goal in Paris.

The Blues will be wary of the threat posed by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani and Co as they look to seal a spot in the quarter-finals of the Champions League.

Here, Sportsmail lists three reasons why Chelsea should be cheerful and three reasons why they should be fearful going into their match against the Ligue 1 outfit.

Three reasons to be cheerful... 

Chelsea’s home comforts 

At home, Chelsea are unbeaten in the Champions League against French opposition, keeping five clean sheets in six games (Won 4, Drawn 2, Lost 0) 

Ibrahimovic struggles to provide knockout blow 

Zlatan Ibrahimovic may strike fear into the hearts of opposition defences, but the PSG striker’s record in the knockout rounds of the Champions League is not so terrifying...  (Group stages: A goal every two games, Knockout stages: A goal every 4.9 games)

They all count...

Half of Chelsea’s Champions League goals this season have been scored via set-pieces (nine). Interestingly, the same proportion of PSG’s goals conceded in Ligue 1 have been from dead-ball situations (12 of 24).

Three reasons to be fearful... 

Terrific record 

Laurent Blanc's men are unbeaten since January 10 (Played 14, Won 10, Drawn 4, Lost 0, Goal difference +16) 

Keeping it tight at the back 

In the first leg at the Parc des Princes, Chelsea were largely dominated by PSG and restricted to just two shots — the second of which was Branislav Ivanovic’s  opener.

Chelsea to pay penalty

The Blues will be desperate to get the tie wrapped up in 90 minutes - their win percentage in penalty shoot-outs in Europe is just 25 per cent (won 1, lost 3).
