One in every 25 New Yorkers is a millionaire, reveals a study out Tuesday.

That shockingly high number comes from a survey conducted by Spear's magazine along with wealth consultancy WealthInsight, which sought to identify the top 20 cities in the world by millionaire density.

The results mean that out of bustling New York's 8 million-plus people, some 389,100 are millionaires.

Can you spot them? New York City and Manhattan in particular is home to the world's fourth largest population of millionaires and the most billionaires

Meanwhile, New York is home to the most billionaires in the world.

But New York, with its 4.63 percent, is just fourth in the world's top 20 for millionaires.

The study found that the riviera city-state of Monaco can claim the most millionaires. There, a shocking 29.21 percent of residents makes seven figures.

Just below Monaco is Zurich, where a none-too-shabby 27.34 percent of the populace is a millionaire.

Puttin' on the Ritz: Monaco came in at No.1 on the list of top millionaire cities. Here, you'll find that nearly 30 percent of residents are millionaires

Seventeen percent of Geneva, Switzerland's 184,000 residents is a millionaire.

London came in just below Franfurt, Germany at No. 6, with 3.39% millionaires. According to Spear's editor Josh Spiro, it isn't just British wealth in the historic town.

'What millionaires particularly love about London is its political stability and heritage,' he said. 'Owning a piece of history in a city such as London is an aspiration for many, particularly wealthy individuals from overseas.'

Maybe he's a New Yorker?
