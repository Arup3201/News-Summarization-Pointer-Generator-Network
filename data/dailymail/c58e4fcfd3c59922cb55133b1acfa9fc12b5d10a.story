A mother whose eyes were gouged out by her lover told yesterday of her determination to ‘get on with life’ for the sake of her children.

Shane Jenkin subjected Tina Nash to a 12-hour attack in which he broke her jaw, throttled her until she was unconscious and blinded her.

Miss Nash said she felt ‘nothing’ toward her attacker who was given an indeterminate sentence yesterday, which he will serve in a mental hospital.

Thug: Jenkin strangled and blinded his then-girlfriend in a sickening 12-hour attack

The 32-year-old had already told of 
her heartache at knowing she will never again see her two sons and said 
losing her sight felt like being buried alive.

Now she says she has turned a corner and is learning to deal with her devastating injuries.

She is starting to feel her way around her house and arranging her wardrobe so she knows which clothes are kept where.

‘I just woke up and thought I have 
got to get on with my life,’ she said. ‘That’s what I did, I got up, 
sorted out my clothes and just got on with it.

‘I am trying to do everything, I am 
having a good go. I don’t want people to feel sorry for me because I 
don’t feel sorry for myself.I feel stronger. I am ready to take on new challenges.

‘I feel a lot more confident, definitely. I am getting the old me back. I don’t think I am brave. I am surviving.

‘You only get one life so I am not going to let him ruin it.’

She said her children did not treat her differently and she just wanted to make them proud.

Jenkin, 33, did not attend court 
yesterday to hear the judge hand down a sentence of a minimum of six 
years less the one year he served awaiting trial.

He attacked Miss Nash while she slept following a night out with friends near her home in Hayle,

Cornwall. Ignoring her desperate 
pleas to call an ambulance, Jenkin kept her imprisoned for 12 hours and 
throttled her into unconsciousness before blinding her.

The night before the appalling – and 
unexplained – attack, he had watched a horror film with Miss Nash that 
featured a woman having her eyes gouged out. Jenkin, who is 6ft 4in, had
attacked Miss Nash before.

The court heard he owned a book about
deranged killer Raoul Moat and had once told Miss Nash: ‘If I am going 
down, I am going down for something worthwhile.’

Judge Christopher Clarke said Jenkin,
who admitted grievous bodily harm with intent, had committed a truly 
terrible crime of extreme violence.

‘That violence has left Tina Nash permanently blind. She has lost the precious gift of sight,’ he told Truro Crown Court.

‘She will never again be able to see her family or her friends or the beautiful coast and countryside of this county.

‘For the people who can see the world
around them it is almost impossible to imagine having one’s sight being
removed by the brutal act of another human being.

‘It is almost to impossible to 
imagine the despair and distress Miss Nash must feel at never being able
to watch her two sons growing up.’

Describing the assault last April, 
Judge Clarke said that Jenkin ‘repeatedly held her tightly around the 
neck and, as he continued to strangle her, she lost consciousness and 
from time to time she hallucinated’.

He added: ‘At some point during this 
attack when she was unconscious, the defendant gouged out her eyes with 
his fingers or thumbs.’

The judge said it could be ‘many, 
many years’ before parole is granted and described Jenkin as ‘a very 
dangerous man from which the public needs to be kept safe’.

Since the attack last April, Miss 
Nash has moved to be near her sisters, where she lives with her sons, 
aged four and 14, and their dog.

Asked about Jenkin after yesterday’s 
sentencing hearing, she said: ‘To be honest I feel nothing towards him –
nothing – because that’s a feeling and I don’t want to have any 
feelings towards him. So, no, I’m not going to waste my time. He never 
existed.’

Urging other victims of domestic 
abuse to seek help, she said: ‘Shane was not mentally ill when he 
attacked me, he was not drunk or under the influence of drugs.

‘It was a silent prolonged attack. 
Shane knows what he did to me that night and he has to live with that 
for the rest of his life. My life changed for ever that night and will 
never be the same but I am now able to move on, start my treatment and 
rebuild my life.

‘I have a future and want to provide a future for my kids and be a good mum.

‘I urge anyone out there suffering 
domestic abuse to contact the police before it is too late. Don’t be 
frightened or embarrassed.’

Miss Nash said last month that she 
missed ‘the things which people take for granted the most, such as 
seeing the sky and the sea’.

She said she was left feeling ‘buried alive, claustrophobic and not in control of my life’ by the assault.

‘I actually look forward to going to sleep because in my dreams I have sight. It’s when I wake up that the truth hits home.’

Jenkin had been repeatedly banned 
from his local pubs in Penzance for violence, and three months before he
blinded Miss Nash he was reportedly charged with breaching bail 
following an assault charge.

Vile: Shane Jenkin, 33, assaulted his girlfriend in a 'premeditated and vicious attack'

Callous Shane Jenkin could turn like 'flicking a switch' and was on a five-year pub ban for violence.

The 6ft 4in thug was banned from pubs several times but excluded again in 2010 after punching a policeman, a pubwatch chairman said.

Jenkin, who was jailed today for blinding his then-girlfriend Tina Nash, struck fear into fellow drinkers who knew his volatile temper could erupt with little warning.

One Penzance barman said Jenkin had previously tried to gouge out a man's eyes during a brawl.

'I and several others have had run-ins 
with him and would say he is generally a nasty piece of work,' said the 
barman, who asked not to be named.

'What he did to Tina he tried to do to 
other people - I know someone else he had a fight with and tried to do 
that to him but he was 6ft 4in and could defend himself.

'He could just turn and go from being nice and polite and jovial then bang, it was like flicking a switch. I saw it on several occasions.'

'I have seen him talking to people, having a laugh to stamping on them on the floor.

'There have been various violent crimes and he has been to jail but he always pulled the mental health card - he says he isn't responsible for his actions and has mental health issues.

'He once dragged someone outside, up the road, put a bench on his head and started jumping on it.

'He ended up with a fractured skull and brain damage and I think he did some prison time for that but played the diminished responsibility card and was out in about 10 months. This was several years ago in his mid-twenties.'

Devon and Cornwall Police would not confirm details of their previous dealings with Jenkin - who has the word 'Outlaw' tattooed on his forearm and a scorpion on his chest.

Helen Cadman, Penzance pubwatch chairman and owner of the Sportsmans Arms in Heamoor, Penzance, said: 'He was put on the pubwatch scheme several times before but was put on it again in March 2010 for assaulting, punching a policeman outside a nightclub out of hours.

'He was on it previously for more minor offences.'

One landlord, who did not want to be named, said Jenkin was a well-known troublemaker.

'I have certainly thrown him out of a few pubs over the last decade,' he said.

'He was on the pubwatch scheme for violence and general drunken behaviour, just generally obnoxious.

Ms Cadman said she noticed he was 'quite aggressive' and that smaller members of staff became intimated by him and that he 'wasn't the full ticket.'

'He was on the pubwatch scheme serving a ban until 2015, a five-year ban. He was a general trouble maker, he'd start fights and get drunk,' she added.

Three months before the 33-year-old gouged out his girlfriend's eyes he was charged with breaching bail conditions by failing to observe a curfew, it was reported.

At the time he was allegedly on bail for an alleged domestic assault causing actual bodily harm.
