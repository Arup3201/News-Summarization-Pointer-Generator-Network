Chips and gravy is a Northern favourite – so it’s no wonder the annual World Gravy Wrestling Championship in Lancashire is a popular event.

Hundreds gathered in the village of Stacksteads, Lancashire, to grapple in around in 1,500 litres of the meaty sauce as temperatures dropped to a chilly 9C.

The 14 men and six women fought to the bitter end as a referee oversaw the events – but that didn’t stop one competitor giving another a wedgie – caught on camera in this hilarious video.

The gravy grapplers transformed into their fighting alter egos – including superman and a tiger – to compete at the Rose n Bowl pub, all in the name of charity.

Now in its eighth year, the event raises around £3,000 annually for East Lancashire Hospice and attracts people from across the north west.

Despite the chilly winds and threatening clouds above, the pub and grounds were filled with children, parents and the wrestlers’ supporters.

One thousand litres of gravy were prepared in advance of the tournament and another 500 litres was needed to top up the pool throughout the match.

Each match lasted two minutes and the winner was the competitor who entertained the audience the most.

Fourteen wrestlers battled it out for the men’s title, while six women competed for their own crown.

Denise Gee, event fundraiser for East Lancashire Hospice, said: ‘This all started off as a bit of fun eight years ago, but it’s become the World Gravy Wrestling Championships and it’s now really well supported.

‘It raises a substantial amount for patient care - around £3,000 to £3,500 each year.

‘It’s a great day out and everyone has fun, but at the same time they raise money for the hospice.’

Ms Gee, who took part in the wrestling dressed as Santa, said: ‘From personal experience, I can tell you it’s pretty sticky.’

As part of the fundraiser, the crowds were offered a chance to take part in a ‘gravy bucket challenge’ - an alternative to the popular ice bucket challenge.
