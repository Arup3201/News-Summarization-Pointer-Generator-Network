Guilty: Aaron Ramsey, 35, was found guilty of severely injuring a child in the death of his son, Johnathan, pictured, in 2011

A North Texas father has been convicted of slowly starving to death his 10-year-old son, slipping his body in a sleeping bag and dumping it in a rural area where it wasn't discovered for over a year.

Aaron Ramsey, 35, was found guilty of severely injuring a child in the death of his son, Johnathan, after less than an hour of deliberations on Tuesday, and in just 20 minutes he was sentenced to life in prison by the Dallas County jury.

Prosecutors said the father locked his son in his room, where he slowly starved on a diet of bread and water.

They contend Ramsey dumped the child's emaciated body in a rural area south of Dallas in 2011. The boy's remains were found in the area a year ago in a creek.

Aaron Ramsey allegedly told police he limited the boy's meals to bread, water and sometimes milk for several months. According to police records, the boy was confined to his bedroom in the family's Dallas home.

The boy's mother, Judy Williams, and other relatives did not see him for months. Williams lives in New Mexico and has custody of the couple's other son, according to relatives.

Johnathan's grandfather, Edward Ramsey, had contacted police early last year to ask them to search for the child because he had not seen the boy for more than a year.

Police said Aaron and Elizabeth 
Ramsey, the child's stepmother, initially claimed the boy had gone to 
live with his mother but later confessed to starving the boy to death.

According to police, Aaron Ramsey said he put his son on 'military rations' because the boy began to misbehave early in 2011.

Ramsey said the boy had punched his stepmother in the stomach when she was pregnant, causing a miscarriage.

Johnathan was found lying on the bedroom floor in August, according to court records.

 Ramsey told detectives he changed his son into his favorite T-shirt, 
placed him into a sleeping bag and inserted a dryer sheet to mask the 
smell of his body, the records said.

Elizabeth Ramsey also is charged with the crime and will be tried separately.
