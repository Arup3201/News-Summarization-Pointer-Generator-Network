Former cocaine addict and alcoholic Diego Maradona has set alarm bells ringing after a slurring speech to journalists outside a restaurant in Argentina.

The soccer legend spoke at snail's pace and repeated himself as he appeared to struggle to finish his sentences after a restaurant meal with ex Veronica Ojeda.

Maradona, who dumped his former girlfriend four months before she gave birth to their 18-month-old son Diego Fernando, is said to be heading for a reunion with the PE teacher.

But it was his apparent state of intoxication outside Buenos Aires eatery El Corralon that caught the headlines as much as his tangled love life.

Diego, 53, spoke out to criticise an arsonist suspected of starting a blaze which destroyed part of his father's home, saying it was the work of a 'sick person'.

His impromptu speech sparked concern among fans who took to Twitter to voice their worry.

One, Gonzalo Armagno, wrote: 'Cocaine destroys brain. Look at poor Maradona.'

Another, Cecilia Molina, said: 'Shame on the person who got him hooked on cocaine.'

The retired footballer's daughter Dalma, a staunch critic of Veronica Ojeda, even reacted to the furore by retweeting messages from fans and admitting she felt ashamed at the furore.

One of her retweeted messages read: 'How bad Maradona looks. Hadn't he stopped drinking with Veronica Ojeda?'

Another said: 'What's that woman with your dad doing by letting him speak. And she says she looks after him!!!'

Mr Maradona was suspended from football for 15 months in 1991 after testing positive for cocaine. He allegedly began using the drug in Barcelona in 1983.

He suffered a heart attack following a cocaine overdose in April 2004 and was admitted to intensive care in a Buenos Aires hospital.

He underwent a stomach reduction op the following year in Cartagena, Colombia.

In March 2007 he was re-admitted to hospital in Argentina and treated for hepatitis and the effects of alcohol abuse and ended up being treated in a psychiatric clinic specialising in alcohol-related problems.

Soon after his discharge in May 2007, he appeared on Argentine television and said he had quit drinking and not used drugs in two and a half years.

Before his dinner date with Veronica Ojeda, his girlfriend of eight years, Mr Maradona was linked to a pretty young journalism student after she published snaps of them together on her Instagram account.

The 25-year-old blonde later denied rumours they were a couple, insisting they were only friends and she would never date 'a person of the age of my dad.'

The woman Mr Maradona dumped Veronica for, 24-year-old Rocio Oliva, is currently fighting extradition after the former footballer accused her of stealing more than Â£200,000 worth of valuables from his home in Dubai.

Former womens' footballer Rocio was arrested at Buenos Aires' international airport earlier this month as she returned from Brazil where she watched the World Cup final.

The blonde, who Maradona dumped at the start of the year following an argument over Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, insists she has done nothing wrong.

Argentine papers say Veronica Ojeda, pictured kissing Mr Maradona at the end of their restaurant meal on Saturday, is considering moving to Dubai where the former footballer is now based.

They are reportedly spending time together at her mansion near Buenos Aires' international airport.

A friend of Mr Maradona's said: 'They are back together. Diego is renting a house in an upmarket neighbourhood on the outskirts of Buenos Aires but hardly ever goes there and is spending all his time at Veronica's place.

'They still haven't made a decision about Dubai but they are talking about returning there together.'
