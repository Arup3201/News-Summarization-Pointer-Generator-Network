A beach hut that was described by a luxury lifestyle magazine as 'too lush for words' has gone on sale for £1.25million, despite attracting bitter complaints from local residents.

The property, which is located in Coldingham Bay in the Scottish Borders comes with four double bedrooms with sea views and terraces, an entrance hallway and open plan kitchen, dining and living area with sliding doors. 

Since it was constructed it has received praise from fans of modern architecture, with Luxe magazine calling it 'too lush for words' in a July review.

Picturesque: The beach hut sits on top of a hill in Coldingham Bay, in the Scottish Borders, and has four double bedrooms all with sea views

Stunning: The property has an open-plan dining, living and kitchen space with doors that open out on to a balcony overlooking the Noth Sea

Controversial: The home was described by luxury lifestyle magazine Luxe as 'too lush for words', but has caused fury among locals who say it is out of character with other beach huts, some of which are 100 years old

Luxury: Each of the four bedrooms has its own terrace, and the property sits in landscaped gardens which extend up and down the hill

However, as the property was built on the site of an old wooden beach hut, and is surrounded by other wooden huts some of which are 100 years old, it has attracted the ire of locals who say it is 'out of keeping' with the area.

One Tripadvisor review of the area by Sandra L reads: 'This lovely spot is overlooked by an absolute monstrosity of a building - a carbuncle is the only suitable description. 

'How this ever got planning permission is a mystery! My memory is of the chalet belonging to the Haven, a wooden building with a corrugated iron roof. I know we must move with the times, but I think this building is a big mistake and spoils the whole beach area.'

However, spokesperson for property management company Sanderson Young, who are dealing with all enquiries called the property ‘one of the most unique, rare and impressive beach houses available within the United Kingdom’.

The home is set into landscaped grounds which extend up and down the hillside. The property can also be rented out for £3,000 for seven nights during peak holiday season.

Pricey: According to the estate agents handling the sale, at peak season the owners of this house could collect £3,000 per week in rent

Problems: One Tripadvisor review of the bay brands the property a 'carbuncle', adding: 'How this ever got planning permission is a mystery'

Anger: The building used to be on the site of an old wooden hut that served as accommodation for staff at a nearby Haven hotel

Holiday rental website coastalretreats.co.uk still have the property advertised to rent and describe it as:'An extraordinary piece of landmark architecture using glass, steel, welsh slate and iroko wood in a stunning location'.

A local business owner added: 'Just generally I hear that most people don’t like it. It’s totally different to everything else in the bay. A lot of tourists come in and say they don’t like it but there are a small group who say it’s stunning. 

'It used to be an old wooden hut, I believe it was the living quarters for the maids at the Haven hotel. Now it’s an invasive piece of modern architecture. 

'I believe that a gentleman owns it and it is on the market, though I’m not sure if it was built to sell or to let. It sits empty for much of the time but every now and then guests do come to stay.'

Fury: Sandra L left this review of the bay on Tripadvisor with a three star rating, the lowest rating the location has ever received, saying the property 'spoils the whole beach area'

Complaints: Others have protested the new addition to the sea front by saying it is out of keeping with the other buildings
