It was the worst kind of news to receive on Christmas Day when Helen Hart was told her dog may no make it through the night.

The six-year-old jack russell terrier had been bitten by a 1.5m brown snake - one of the world's most venomous.

So his chances of survival were very slim, according to the local vet.

But Tater beat the odds and has now been hailed a hero - even dubbed as a 'wonder dog' by the family.

Helen Hart's dog Tater was bitten by a brown 1.5m brown snake on Christmas Day. The offending brown snake (pictured), which is now dead, is held by Mrs Hart's son-in-law Nigel Hamer

Tater is a six-year-old jack russell terrier but became paralysed when he got bitten by the snake. The local vet kept a close eye on him and placed him under the Christmas tree

Mrs Hart has had Tater for six years on her property in Orange, the Central West region of NSW.

'When my husband died my daughter told me that I should get a dog,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'I'm not much of a dog friendly person so I wasn't too keen on the idea but we bought him anyway from a lady down the road for $50.

'The reason why we call him Tater is because my husband used to grow potatoes so we named the dog 'Potatoes' - in loving memory of my husband.' 

Since then Mrs Hart admits she never cared too much for Tater - also known as Tate - but when it came to Christmas this year, she decided she'll take him a family lunch at her daughter's house.

'She lives in Newbridge (also in the Central West region) so I decided to take the dog with me for the Christmas lunch,' Mrs Hart said.

'My son-in-law was watching the dog while everyone was getting ready with the food when he heard Tate yelp.

'Then we went over and saw that there was a five foot brown snake. My son-in-law isolated it then killed it. It had to be done because we had family around.'

Mrs Hart admitted that she never cared too much for Tater - also known as Tate - but when she was told that her dog might die, she was distraught

'That's when I realised I really loved him because I didn't want him to die,' Mrs Hart said

Ten minutes later, their fears were confirmed when Tate began to show symptoms of a snake bite.

'His back leg was paralysed and he couldn't walk,' Mrs Hart said. 

'I was so distraught. We called the emergency number for the vet in Blayney which is about 15 minutes from where we were.'

Once Tate was examined by Vet Ruth Thompson, of Blayney Veterinary Hospital, things were looking grim.

'The vet told me that Tate probably won't make it through the night but she'll take him with her to keep an eye on him,' Mrs Hart said.

'That's when I realised I really loved him because I didn't want him to die.'

The next morning, on Boxing Day, Mrs Hart received a call from Dr Thompson.

'She told me he's still in a bad state but he's alive and that I can take him home,' Mrs Hart said.

'So he's back in Orange with me and he's doing well, getting a lot of love and attention.

'He's a bit of a celebrity now. We think he's a bit of a hero. He's just gorgeous.'

Other family members have affectionately described him as 'Tater the Wonder Dog'.
