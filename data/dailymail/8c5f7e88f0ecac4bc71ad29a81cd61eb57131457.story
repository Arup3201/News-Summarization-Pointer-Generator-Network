Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe’s loyalists have paid tribute to Kim Jong Il, describing the 69-year-old North Korean despot as a ‘lovely man’, who ‘was chosen by his people and regularly conducted elections’.

Didymus Mutasa, the secretary of administration for Mugabe’s Zanu-PF party, told Zimbabwe state radio: ‘He was our great friend and we are not ashamed of being associated with him.’

The
 dead North Korean leader was involved in the training and equipping of a
 para-military group in the African country in the early 1980s.

Mugabe
 sought help to train the infamous Fifth Brigade unit - which killed 
almost 20,000 people in an operation named Gukurahundi, meaning the 
first rains that wash the chaff. It has since been described as genocide.

Kim Jong Il played an instrumental role in training the crack special killer unit that operated outside normal Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) command.

But Methuseli Moyo, spokesman for the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (Zapu), which was at the receiving end of the massacres, said his party had 'no option but to welcome' the demise of the dictator.

He said: 'We will not shed any crocodile tears for the trainer of Gukurahundi, the only problem about his death is that it was before he could account for his actions, we are not apologetic about that.'

Meanwhile, in Cuba citizens are observing three days of mourning in a show of solidarity for its fellow communist state.

Following his father's death, North Korea's new young leader will be Kim Jong Un, who will rule the country alongside his uncle and the military, sources it was revealed today.

Jang Song Thaek will work alongside his inexperienced and untested 28-year-old nephew - the first time since the end of World War Two a collective rather than a dictator from the family dynasty will be in charge.

The army's backing of Kim Jong Il's third son, his proclaimed successor, has also calmed fears there could be a military coup.

And it has prompted speculation there 
will now be a smooth transition of power - meaning little change for the
 millions of impoverished and poverty-stricken citizens.

A
 source also revealed that the test-firing of a North Korean missile on 
Monday, following the announcement of Kim Jong Il's death on Saturday, 
was a warning shot against the U.S.

The source said: 'With the missile test, North Korea wanted to deliver the message that they have the ability to protect themselves.

'But North Korea is unlikely to conduct a nuclear test in the near future unless provoked by the United States and South Korea.'

Jang Song Thaek's appointment was widely 
expected after his addition to the National Defence Commission, the 
supreme leadership council led by his brother Kim Jong Il as head of the
 military state, in 2009.

UN food experts urged immediate food aid for the isolated nation just months before Kim Jong Il's (pictured) death.

Three groups described the urgent need for food, reporting 'acute malnutrition' among North Korean children, 'widespread consumption of grass' and elderly people on a 'knife edge'.

There was 'substantial evidence' of a growing food crisis for millions who live in the countryside - beyond the relative comfort of Pyongyang.

'What we saw was extensive chronic malnutrition and cases of acute malnutrition, which is where the person is basically dying,' said David Austin, director of North Korea's Mercy Corps.

He added: 'More than 50 per cent of people who are reliant on (state-provided grain) were out seeking out alternative food - things like bark, wild grass, and leaves - and mixing it in with food. We found there was no protein or fat in people’s diets.'

And when he returned in September, government grain rations had been cut by more than half to about 150 grams per day - the equivalent of one potato.

Alongside Kim Jong Il's younger sister Kim Kyong Hui, he is expected to guide the 'young general' during his formative days in power.

As part of the consolidation of power, security was stepped up in cities and troops put on high alert as South Korean activists launched giant balloons containing tens of thousands of propaganda leaflets across the border.

Some showed graphic pictures of former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi's battered corpse and described his gruesome death.

They oppose a hereditary transfer of power in North Korea - where Kim Jong Il ruled for 17 years after inheriting power from his father, national founder and eternal North Korean President Kim Il Sung, who died in 1994.

And in another sign of border tension, Chinese boatmen along a river separating North Korea and China said North Korean police ordered them to stop giving rides to tourists, saying they will fire on the boats if they see anyone with cameras.

Meanwhile, the young Kim on Tuesday led a procession of senior officials in a viewing of Kim Jong Il's body, which is being displayed in a glass coffin near that of Kim Il Sung.

Publicly presiding over the funeral proceedings was an important milestone for his successor, strengthening his image as the country's political face at home and abroad.

State media showed video of Kim Jong Un receiving mourners, including foreign envoys, as he stood near his father's body with an honour guard.

He was sombre during the greetings, although footage at one point showed him teary-eyed. 

A report in the North's official Korean Central News Agency did not specify which foreign countries the envoys represented.

According to official media, more than five million North Koreans have gathered at monuments and memorials in the capital since the death of Kim Jong Il.

Hundreds of thousands visited monuments around the city within hours of the official announcement that Kim had died.

The
 North has declared an 11 day period of mourning that will culminate in 
his state funeral and a national memorial service on December 28 to 29.

Half-way
 across the world, flags flew at half-staff on Tuesday in Cuba as the 
country began three days of official mourning in a show of solidarity 
with its fellow communist state.         

The
 Council of State decreed the mourning period without comment and said 
flags would be lowered at all government buildings and military 
installations.     

A book of condolences was opened at 
the North Korean embassy in Havana, with a big photo of the dead leader 
and flowers in the entrance.               

Cuba
 and North Korea are two of the world's last communist nations and have 
maintained good relations since establishing diplomatic ties in 1960, 
the year after Fidel Castro took power in a 1959 revolution on the 
Caribbean island.          

They were both on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism until North Korea was removed in 2008.

Cuba
 is facing its own succession issues as it approaches a generational 
leadership change without much new blood waiting in the wings.     

Cuba was ruled for 49 years by Fidel 
Castro, 85, who was succeeded by brother and then first vice president 
Raul Castro in 2008.    

Under the constitution, if Raul 
Castro were to leave office tomorrow, 81-year-old Jose Ramon Machado 
Ventura, current first vice president of the ruling Council of State, 
would succeed him until 2013, although he could be replaced sooner.  

Government
 opponents said they feared Cuban leaders could circumvent the 
constitution and follow North Korea's lead by quickly replacing Machado 
Ventura with a Castro family member.      

But
 other Cubans discounted the possibility that the government would put 
another Castro in power, saying the Cuban system would not permit 
it.
