An investigation into the 1959 plane crash that killed Buddy Holly and three others could now be reopened after a respected pilot brought forward new factors as to how the aircraft may have gone down.

At the time of the crash, the Civil Aeronautics Board ruled the probable cause of the crash was error by the pilot, Roger Peterson, who took off from Mason City to Moorhead, Minnesota, in inclement weather, even though he was qualified.

The chartered plane crashed in Iowa not long after takeoff, killing Holly, Peterson, and musicians Ritchie Valens and J.P. Richardson. 

Now L.J. Coon, an experienced pilot from New England, says a variety of other factors - such as weight and balance calculations, the rate of the plane's climb and descent, fuel gauge readings and the passenger-side rudder - should have been considered, according to The Globe Gazette.

Wreck: On February 3, 1959, a light aircraft chartered by Buddy Holly crashed in Clear Lake, Iowa, killing the singer and three others aboard. An investigation into the reasons for the crash - ruled at the time to be pilot - could now be reopened, after a pilot petitioned for other factors to be considered 

Fiery: The accident, known as 'The Day the Music Died', that occurred on February 3, 1959, killed rock and roll musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J. P. 'The Big Bopper' Richardson, as well as the pilot, Roger Peterson

Too young: Buddy Holly was only 22 when he died, with his career only lasting 18 months. He is still considered one of the best musicians of all time

Tragic: The body of one of the three famous rock 'n' roll singers killed in the crash of a single engine bonanza  lies a few feet from the wreckage of the plane on February 3, 1959, in Clear Lake, Iowa

The National Transportation Safety Board has agreed to consider reopening the investigation.

Coon's motivation was to 'the heroic effort that took place in those 4.9 miles' by the pilot, Peterson, before the plane crashed.

The plane had been in the air less than four minutes. 

Coon received a letter from the NTSB saying they had received his call for a reinvestigation. 

'You have gotten our attention. Let us do our due diligence in order to give you a proper answer,' the letter stated. 

The NTSB will now determine whether or not the submission meets the requirements of a Petition for Reconsideration.

History and many other people believe that Peterson was the direct cause of the February 3, 1959 crash. 

Killed: Buffy Holly, who was one of the most popular entertainers of the 1950's, died in a plane crash in 1959

Gary W. Moore, author of Hey Buddy, a book about Holly's life, told the Globe Gazaette that the Aeronautics Board got it right 56 years ago.

'I think that what (a new investigation) is going to find it is its pretty simple,' Moore said.

'The pilot was unqualified to fly in those conditions and he lost control of the airplane.'

Holly, a rockabilly pioneer, was only 22-years-old when he died, with a career lasting 18 months.

Despite such a short time, Rolling Stone in 2004 ranked Holly as number 13 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.
