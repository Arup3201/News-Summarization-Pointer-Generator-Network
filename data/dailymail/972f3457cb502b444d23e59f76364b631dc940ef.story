Earlier this year, mysterious craters began to appear in Siberia, sparking countless theories as to their origins.

Now scientists think they were caused by the explosion of gas underground.

And the explanation could explain the loss of ships and aircraft in the controversial area known as the Bermuda Triangle.

Earlier this year, mysterious craters appeared in Siberia (shown). Scientists now claim that an underground gas explosion was to blame. They examined the largest crater and found evidence of gas hydrates. The theory could also explain why planes and boasts have vanished in the region known as the Bermuda Triangle

Three giant holes were spotted in the Yamal and Taymyr peninsulas provoking claims that they were a man-made hoax, meteorites or even stray missiles.

But now, after probing the largest of the craters, scientists said the they were most likely created by underground gas explosions. 

'Heating from above the surface due to unusually warm climatic conditions, and from below, due to geological fault lines, led to a huge release of gas hydrates,' reported The Siberian Times - citing scientists from the Trofimuk Institute of Petroleum-Gas Geology and Geophysics in Novosibirsk.

US Government agency The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said that foul weather and poor navigation are likely to blame for any mishaps in the area between Miami, Bermuda and Puerto Rico.

Dozens of ships and planes have mysteriously vanished in the area.

But Noaa said the number of vehicles missing there is no different to elsewhere in the world - and the theory that some mysterious supernatural force is sinking boats and planes is a myth.

'There is no evidence that mysterious disappearances occur with any greater frequency in the Bermuda Triangle than in any other large, well-traveled area of the ocean,' the agency stated on its website in February.

Gas hydrates are ice-like forms of water containing gas molecules, notably methane.

They exist in permafrost regions such as northern Siberia, but also under the oceans in some parts of the world.

'The main element - and this is our working theory to explain the Yamal crater - was a release of gas hydrates,' said scientist Vladimir Potapov. 

'It turned out that there are gas hydrates both in the deep layer which on peninsula is several hundred metres down, and on the layer close to the surface.

'There might be another factor, or factors, that could have provoked the air clap. Each of the factors added up and gas exploded, leading to appearance of the crater.'

He stressed that the crater is located on the intersection of two tectonic faults. Yamal peninsula is seismically quiet, yet the area of the crater looked into had quite an active tectonic life.

'That means that the temperature there was higher than usual,' Mr Potapov said.

Crucially, recent warm summer weather has melted gases trapped in layers just below the surface.

Three giant holes (one shown) were spotted in the Yamal and Taymyr peninsulas earlier this year provoking claims that they were a manmade hoax, meteorites or even stray missiles. But now after probing the largest of the craters, scientists say the theory that they were caused by explosions of gas underground is most likely

The explanation for the formation of this crater might also explain the disappearance of boats and planes in the area referred to as the Bermuda Triangle, according to the experts. 

The area stretches from the British Overseas Territory in the North Atlantic Ocean to the Florida coast, to Puerto Rico.

Russian scientist Igor Yeltsov, the deputy head of the Trofimuk Institute, said: 'There is a version that the Bermuda Triangle is a consequence of gas hydrates reactions.

'They start to actively decompose with methane ice turning into gas. It happens in an avalanche-like way, like a nuclear reaction, producing huge amounts of gas.

'That makes the ocean heat up and ships sink in its waters mixed with a huge proportion of gas.

Pictured is one of the Yamal craters. It is in the area's Taz district near the village of Antipayuta and has a diameter of about 49ft (15 metres). According to local residents, the hole formed on 27 September 2013

'The same [method] leads to the air getting supersaturated with methane, which makes the atmosphere extremely turbulent and leads to aircraft crashes.'

Reporting the claims, the journal Science in Siberia dubbed the craters 'a distant relative of the Bermuda Triangle'.

Scientists conducted detailed research at the crater, including taking samples to a depth of 985ft (300 metres).

'We checked magnetic and radiation backgrounds, and found no abnormalities there,' said Oleg Kushnarenko, chief engineer of a mission which lasted four days.

Mr Potapov said that their theory will be studied further.

'We all have to keep suggesting hypotheses and testing them,' he said. 'The crater itself is incredibly interesting from a scientific point of view.'

The explanation for the formation of this crater might apparently also explain the disappearance of boats and planes in the so-called Bermuda Triangle region. The area, which is said to have 'swallowed' boats, stretches from the British Overseas Territory in the North Atlantic Ocean to the Florida coast, to Puerto Rico (shown)

This first giant crater, shown, measured around 262ft (80 metres) and was found in far northern Siberia. It is believed to have been caused by rising temperatures and a gas explosion in the area

He added there was a need to identify other areas in the world where such underground gas explosions can occur.

'We must also pay attention to areas where the same thing might potentially happen,' he said. 

Mr Kushnarenko also revealed that security concerns meant the research team were not allowed to go inside the crater which is around 230ft (70 metres) deep.

'There was a great temptation to go down the crater, but the Institute didn't give the go ahead, saying it was too risky,' he said.

The crater they studied is in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous, some 19 miles (30km) from the Bovanenkovo gas field. 

The original crater was found in the Yamal Peninsula, baffling scientists, before two further craters were found in the Taz district and Taymyr Peninsula

This third crater is in the Taymyr Peninsula and was accidentally discovered by reindeer herders who almost fell into it, in the vicinity of the remote outpost of Nosok. The funnel is a perfectly formed cone, said locals who are mystified over its formation. Its depth is estimated at between 200 to 330ft (60 to 100 metres)
