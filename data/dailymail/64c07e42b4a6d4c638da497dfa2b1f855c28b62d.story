An intricate etching on ostrich eggs joined together to make a sphere is the oldest globe of the New World ever to be discovered.

Latin inscriptions and delicate outlines of countries informed by knowledge of explorers such as Christopher Columbus, made in the early 1500s cover the sphere, but the origin of the globe is a mystery.

A cartographer believes the globe could have been made in Florence, Italy and claims that the skilful engraver could even have crafted the object in the workshop of Leonardo da Vinci.

An intricate etching on ostrich eggs joined together could be the oldest globe of the New World to ever be discovered. The delicate outlines of countries are informed by knowledge of explorers such as Christopher Columbus, made in the early 1500s. It's origin is a mystery

The object is about the size of a grapefruit and is constructed from the lower halves of two ostrich eggs to make it almost spherical.

Until now the oldest globe showing the New World was thought to be the 'Lenox Globe,' which is kept in the New York Public Library, but a study of the egg globe, published in The Washington Map Society's journal, The Portolan, said this one is older.

Belgium research scholar Dr S. Missinne believes the egg globe could actually have been used as to cast the Lennox globe, dating it at approximately 1504.

Just seven names mark the Western Hemisphere (pictured) and none denote North America, which is shown as a group of islands. However, three names are marked in South America: Mundus novus, - New World - Terra de Brazil and Terra Sanctae Crucis, which translates as 'land of the holy cross'

He said the globe reflects knowledge of the New World gleaned by early European explorers including Amerigo Vespucci, after whom the Americas were named.

It contains different types of ships, monsters, waves, a marooned sailor struck by a shipwreck, 71 place names and one sentence that reads 'hic svnt dracones' or 'here be dragons'.

Cartographers have said that for many countries, including Japan and Brazil, the globe is the oldest that marks their country

Tom Sander, editor of The Portolan who has inspected the globe, told the Society said the find was a major discovery and has been dated after a year of scientific examination.

The egg globe was bought from a dealer at the London map Fair in 2012 who claimed it had come from an 'important European collection,' but the current owner made it available to Dr Missinne for research.

A cartographer believes the globe could have been made in Florence, Italy and claims it could have come from the workshop of Leonardo da Vinci. It is pictured with plain ostrich eggs

He admitted to being sceptical about the origin, date, geography and provenance of the globe at first as nobody had heard of it before and discoveries of this kind are extremely rare.

The globe was subject to computer topography testing, carbon dating and an analysis of the innk used in the engraving in its surface, as well as checks that the geographical, cartographic and historical details all added up.

He told the journal: 'I was excited to look into it further, 
and the more I did so, and the more research that we did, the clearer it
 became that we had a major find.'

More than 100 experts were consulted across the globe to make sure the globe really is the real deal.
