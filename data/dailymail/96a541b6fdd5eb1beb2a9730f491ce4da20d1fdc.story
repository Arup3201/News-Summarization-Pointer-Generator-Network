The discredited Liverpool Care Pathway is still being used in some hospitals despite having been scrapped, a Commons report will reveal.

A cancer charity warns that despite an NHS ban, the controversial end-of-life programme is still in use under ‘a different name’.

The report comes as police are investigating the death of a second ‘healthy’ pensioner at a hospital in Cheshire. The family of Margaret ‘Nellie’ Smart, 93, lodged a formal complaint against Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, saying they were convinced the mother of 12 died after being dehydrated.

Nurses told MPs that some hospitals have merely ‘tweaked’ the end-of-life protocol and given it another title – meaning the ‘abuse’ suffered by some frail and vulnerable patients under the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) may still be happening.

The Royal College of Nursing said its members had ‘not seen a significant difference’ in the way care is delivered in England since the pathway was withdrawn last year.

In a report out tomorrow, MPs on the Commons Health Select Committee are set to urge hospitals to review their procedures to ensure the LCP is not used.

They are expected to say that, in far too many cases, it is unclear whether proper discussions have been held with patients and their families.

They are also set to call for social care for the terminally ill to be free, to ensure people are not forced to suffer bad deaths because of money worries.

An initial police inquiry into the death of an elderly patient has now been expanded after Mrs Smart’s family complained about alleged neglect at the same hospital. She died after the NHS ban on the controversial pathway was imposed.

Her family believe that the great-grandmother would still be alive if she had not been admitted to Warrington General Hospital for checks following a suspected minor stroke.

The Liverpool Care Pathway sees patients sedated, denied food and water and then allowed to die 

The Mail uncovered the cruel 'Death Pathway' on July 16, 2013

The trust is already being investigated after Angela Johnson, the daughter of 85-year-old Alice Johnson who died on the LCP shortly before its abolition, made an almost identical complaint weeks earlier.

The LCP involves the withdrawal of life-saving treatment. Patients are sedated and most are denied food and fluids. They typically die within 29 hours.

Critics said it was a way of hastening death, and – following pressure from the Daily Mail – it was phased out following the Neuberger review two years ago, which found some patients were so dehydrated they were forced to suck on hospital sponges.

No hospital was meant to be using the pathway from summer last year. They were instead given a set of five care ‘priorities’ by the Department of Health.

But in written evidence to the Commons inquiry, the charity Macmillan Cancer Support said: ‘Some areas have worked well to develop [new] guidance ... other areas, however, are still using the Liverpool Care Pathway by a different name.’

Labour MP Rosie Cooper said that if the pathway was still in use, how can we know whether the ‘abuses, misunderstandings and lack of education isn’t going on under our noses now?’

Macmillan told the MPs too many doctors and nurses do not know how to talk to patients and their families about death.
