Some would describe it as a Dopey decision – and it has certainly left the audience feeling Grumpy.

Theatregoers watching Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs this Christmas are complaining of being short-changed in more ways than one after producers replaced the dwarfs with child actors to cut costs.

The children appear on stage wearing masks, but their lines are pre-recorded by adult actors and played to the theatre on a loop while the young performers try to match their movements to the soundtrack.

The dwarfs have been replaced by children in masks but this has upset some pantomime loved who feel they are being short-changed

Axed: Dwarf actors have been axed from Wolverhampton's Grand Theatre's production of Snow White because they are too expensive. Child actors, pictured, have stepped into the role instead

And audience members aren’t the only 
ones giving directors short shrift over the move, as dwarfs are furious 
that the ‘greedy’ decision has put them out of work.

A spokesman for the production at 
the  Wolverhampton Grand, which stars Sam Kane and his wife, former page
three girl Linda Lusardi, said the decision was taken because dwarf 
actors were ‘very, very expensive’ and most of the show’s budget was 
taken up by special effects.

But Peter Burroughs, director of 
Willow  Management, an agency specialising in the representation of 
dwarf actors, complained that the move ‘destroyed the magic’ of the 
classic pantomime.

Mr Burroughs, who is a dwarf himself,
added: ‘It’s not fair at all – it destroys the magic  to have the 
voices pre-recorded. It’s tradition to have dwarfs in this role, the 
clue is in the name in the first place.

‘I had one guy on our books who was 
due  to perform there. He is absolutely devastated. I have never heard  
of a company pre-recording the words that will be spoken by  the dwarfs.
There’s no way that  will seem right.

‘I suppose it’s a sign of the harsh 
economic times, but there remain plenty of other companies who are able 
to put on shows with some of our actors in their proper roles.’

Mr Burroughs admitted dwarf actors 
command a slight premium over other supporting actors in shows because 
of the ‘niche market’ they operate in.

He said the cost of hiring a dwarf to
appear in the pantomime would be between £600 and £850 per week, 
adding: ‘These guys are trying to earn a living wage. Wolverhampton 
theatre is stripping small people of their livelihood.

‘It’s not very nice to be exploiting them like this and I hope the general public see this. To me this is just plain greedy.’

Qdos entertainment, the company 
behind the pantomime, would not reveal how much the child actors would 
be paid for playing the seven dwarfs.

But over the show’s six-week run, if 
each dwarf was paid £700 per week the bill would amount to almost 
£30,000. In the theatre’s 2006 production of the same fairytale, seven 
dwarfs hired from an acting agency did appear.

The attempt to save cash this year 
comes despite the theatre breaking its own sales record last year with a
different pantomime, which took more than £1.1million.

Jonathan Kiley, a director of Qdos 
Entertainment, said the company was still investing ‘hundreds of 
thousands of pounds’ in the theatre’s annual spectacular.

He added: ‘Shows have become 
incredibly expensive as audiences expect amazing effects and sound 
quality they would get from the stereo in their homes.

‘We want the shows to be as fantastic as possible and we spend a lot of money on effects.

‘But money isn’t limitless and dwarfs
are very, very expensive.’ Mr Kiley claimed the children worked ‘quite 
well’, adding: ‘With the masks and costumes on they look just like the 
Disney dwarfs.’

However, the move has not gone down 
well with theatregoers. One said: ‘I could go to any amateur production 
and see children playing dwarfs.’

And John Eley, a 27-year-old teacher from Walsall who was planning to go to the performance, said he had now changed his mind.

He added: ‘It’s cutting corners, 
isn’t it? I could understand it at a school pantomime but not in a big 
theatre. It’s a bit of a rip-off.’
