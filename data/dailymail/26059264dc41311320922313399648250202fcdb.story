Dating app Tinder is now matching 5 million people per day,  and users are swiping through 750 million profiles a day, its founder has revealed.

Founder and CEO Sean Rad claims the apps success is down to it being 'like the real world but better'.

He also told users that the profile picture was key - and that 'headshots don't work' on the site.

Dating app Tinder is now matching 5 million people per day,  and users are swiping through 750 million profiles a day, its founder has revealed.

Sean Rad, founder and CEO of Tinder, said headshots were a bad idea on the site

Speaking at Upfront Summit in Los Angeles, Rad said Tinder started about a year and half ago because friends realized they were having trouble meeting people.

He told the conference 'In the real world we send out signals subconsciously to people if we're interested or not,'

'We wanted to build something that makes that the norm,' he said, according to MarketingLand.

'it's really an analog to what we do in the real world .. it's like the real world but better'

Rad also revealed the firm is now approaching a billion matches since it started.

When asked what profile's worked best, he also admitted the service was picture-led.

'It's all about the picture,' he said, and claimed the app maker is not ashamed of that.'

He advised people to choose their picture carefully.

He also advised people to talk about friends and interests they have in common - information they wouldn't have in a 'real world' meeting.

On average users open the app seven times a day - with almost a billion matches since it launched 18 months ago

He also admitted headshots were a bad choice.

'Headshots don't work.

'People like to see personality in Tinder photos, they want photos of say you skiing, rather than modeling, that expresses what you actually do.'

He also said users on average open the app seven times a day.

Rad said the key to success was a profile pic that revealed someone's personality - and to talk about shared friends with a match

Part of the apps recent success has been down to the 'Sochi effect' when athletes in the winter Olympics told of the apps popularity in the athlete's village.

Rad told the Wall Street Journal that Tinder saw a 400 percent day-over-day spike in growth during the Sochi Games. Many of the athletes used the app as a way to hook up at the Russian resort town.
