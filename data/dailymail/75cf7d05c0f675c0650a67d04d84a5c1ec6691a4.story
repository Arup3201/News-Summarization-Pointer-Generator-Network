Just over a week ago notorious ladies man Russell Brand was spotted enjoying an intimate dinner a deux with millionairess Jemima Khan in London.

And on Sunday, the unlikely duo appeared to confirm their romance as they stepped out together looking very affectionate in New York's East Village.

The outing seemingly solves the riddle of who Russell was referring to in a lengthy piece in The Guardian last week, when he admitted he was dating somebody, but refused to identify who.

Instead, he said: 'I'm
not typically immune to the allure of objectified women, but I am 
presently beleaguered by a nerdish, whirling dervish, and am eschewing 
all others.'

Romantic strolll: Russell Brand walks with Jemima Khan in New York

Russell
looked his usual eclectic self for the date in an outfit consisting of 
low-slung distressed jeans, which he paired with a sleeveless top that 
showed off the several tattoos adorning his yoga-toned arms.

The
38-year-old comedian wore a blue scarf printed with white stars around
his neck and carried a jacket in one arm, leaving the other arm free to 
cuddle Jemima.

Meanwhile, 39-year-old socialite 
and heiress Jemima - 11 years older than Russell's ex-wife Katy Perry - looked casual yet chic in a pair of fitted blue jeans teamed
with a crisp white shirt.

She paired her low-key yet elegant ensemble with a pair of grey heeled boots, and left her long hair loose and tousled.

As they strolled along in the sunshine, Russell seemed transfixed by elegant 
Jemima and wasn't afraid to put his arms around her as they enjoyed what
looked to be an intense conversation.

While
Russell and Jemima have been friends for years, they have only become 
closer recently, when they dined at a low-key Vietnamese restaurant in 
the funnyman's old stomping ground of Hoxton.

More than just friends? This is the second time the pair have gone out together in a matter of a few daysÂ

Jemima and Russell are believed to have first met two years ago, when she commissioned him to write an article 
for the Left-wing New Statesman magazine when she was its guest editor 
for a week.

While Russell's divorce from Katy was made official in July 2012, Jemima's most recent relationship was with actor Hugh Grant, from whom she split in 2007.
