Islamic State's barbaric uprising in Iraq and Syria is gaining  traction in North Africa where extremists are now 'mimicking its rhetoric and brutality', security experts have warned.

Rebel networks in Libya and Egypt have been pledging allegiance to ISIS in recent weeks and are even being helped to set up new terror cells.

The opening of a new front is concerning officials in Washington because the expansion is taking hold in two countries which have struggled to quash extremism in recent years.

Creeping influence: Two extremist groups have pledged allegiance to ISIS  in the Libyan town of Darna and the Sinai Peninsula in recent weeks raising fears they could be expanding their caliphate in North Africa

A U.S intelligence official, who spoke anonymously, said: 'ISIL's (ISIS) stated goal of expanding its caliphate and its adherence to a strict form of Shariah has definitely resonated with a collection of extremists across North Africa, who appear to be mimicking ISIL's rhetoric and brutality.'

In Darna, north-eastern Libya, a group of young militants reportedly from the Islamic Youth Shura Council who claim to control the town, declared its allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi earlier this month. 

The terror chief, who has long tried to recruit militants from Al Qaeda, responded by dispatching one of his henchmen to the town to become the group's 'emir' or commander.

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group's reclusive leader, made his first video appearance in Mosul in July to announce his vision for a self-styled caliphate, a form of Islamic state. 

Meanwhile, another extremist group, this time on the Sinai Peninsula, has also pledged allegiance to ISIS, it was reported by the Washington Times.

Members of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis  (above) on the Sinai Peninsula reportedly circulated a video that bore all the hallmarks of Islamic State's slick propaganda wing after pledging allegiance in recent weeks

The paper says U.S. officials have shown particular concern after members of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (ABM) reportedly circulated a video that bore all the hallmarks of Islamic State's slick propaganda wing.

There are fears that Ansar Beit al-Maqdis may prove the biggest threat to Cairo after regional reports hinted that ISIS is helping them to create new terror cells in Egypt's heartland.

Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, said: 'I don't think there's any doubt that the Islamic State is going to commit and claim responsibility for an increasing number of attacks in North Africa, both in Libya and the Sinai during the year ahead.' 

However, he says that while ISIS's insurgency has become popular with a younger generation of militants, there are older factions which are resisting

'It's pretty clear there's actually been a split within ABM on the issue of joining al-Baghdadi's group,' he added.
