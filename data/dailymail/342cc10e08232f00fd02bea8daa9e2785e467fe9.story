The rise of Eurosceptic parties is a 'worrying development' for the European Union which has helped keep peace for the past 50 years, the German foreign minister has warned.

Warning against the type of 'nationalism' which caused the First World War, Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the European Union had convinced countries to 'get together, politically' after years of conflict.

Speaking on his first visit to London since being appointed in December, he warned, when asked about Tory Eurosceptics calling for Britain to exit the EU, that this route could have 'dangers'.

But the minister gave a glimmer of hope to David Cameron by saying Germany is not against the principle of changing EU treaties to return some powers to national parliaments.

Mr Steinmeier warned politicians not to 'backtrack' on what had been achieved through European integration and said the run-up to the 1914-18 war showed the importance of close ties.

He said: 'You have got Eurosceptics getting together in parties, getting more public attention, and while Europe is in a crisis it doesn't make our work any easier.

'As a politician you have got a clear choice, either you hide or you really keep going along the same lines of the positive experience we have had over the last 50 years.

'The European Union is one of the reasons for peace, even though our interests may have been different, even in spite of our different histories before agreeing on European cooperation.

'Despite the wounds we have inflicted on each other, we have managed to get together - politically - in this part of the world. We have convinced people, we have learned to deal with different opinions and that is civilising progress which cannot be questioned or challenged.'

He added: 'The history before the First world war was of not talking to each other, of alienation, of nationalisms...These experiences have led to a conviction that these dangers have to be forever banned from Europe, and it should be the basis of our common work in a common Europe.'

Mr Cameron has promised an in-out referendum on Britain's membership in 2017 if he wins the next election, after he has tried to negotiate a better deal.

However he is under pressure from the UK Independence Party, which wants Britain to leave the EU immediately and restrict immigration. It is expected to top the poll in the European elections in May, pushing the Tories into third place.  

Far Right parties across Europe, such as Front National in France and Jobbik in Hungary - which is accused of fuelling racial hatred - are also expected to get record numbers of MEPs in May.

Mr Steinmeier said Germany wanted the UK to remain 'a strong an important player in the European Union' - and to influence policy 'not from the sidelines but in the midst of it'.

At a press conference with foreign secretary William Hague, Mr Steinmeier said Germany's relationship with Britain was 'almost perfect, there are hardly any complications'.

He  admitted that the EU needs reform to be 'more functional and more efficient' but not restrictions on free movement of people, which he said Germany considered to be 'part of the solution'.

His remarks come after a bruising week for the prime minister, which saw him face down a major rebellion by 86 of his backbenchers over immigration on Thursday.

Mr Cameron appeared unable to control his party as dozens of MPs backed an attempt to stop foreign prisoners using the right to a family life in the Human Rights Act to stay in Britain.

They had been warned it was illegal by the home secretary, but the rebels were only defeated with help from the Labour leader Ed Miliband who ordered MPs to oppose the plans.
