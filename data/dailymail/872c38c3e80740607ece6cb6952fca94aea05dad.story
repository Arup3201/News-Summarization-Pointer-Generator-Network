Jefferson Montero has been ruled out for around a month after the Swansea winger suffered a hamstring strain.

The club announced on their official website on Monday that the Ecuador international would face a spell on the sidelines after limping off during Swansea's 1-0 victory over Aston Villa on Boxing Day.

Montero left the field in tears in the 22nd minute after he had won the free kick that Gylfi Sigurdsson scored to earn Swansea three points.

The news will come as a major blow to boss Garry Monk after the 25-year-old has enjoyed an excellent start to his Swans career, having joined in the summer from Mexican side Morelia.

'Hopefully it's not too serious because Jeff's been fantastic for us. He's been a real good player for us and hopefully he's not out for too long,' Monk said after the game on Friday.

Montero has made 20 appearances in all competitions during the first half of his debut season in England but is not likely to feature for Swansea again until February.

The pacey wide man will miss key Premier League games against Liverpool, West Ham and Chelsea as well as the FA Cup third round tie against Tranmere on January 3.
