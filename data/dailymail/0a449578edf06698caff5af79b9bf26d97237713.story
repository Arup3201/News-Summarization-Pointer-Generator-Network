Patrick Kluivert insists Louis van Gaal will 'absolutely' want to win the Premier League at the first attempt with Manchester United.

The former Holland striker was assistant to Van Gaal as the Dutch finished third at the World Cup in Brazil.

His old boss has now taken up the reins at Old Trafford and, despite United’s title defence finishing in a disastrous seventh-placed return last season, Kluivert believes No 1 spot will be the aim this time around.

Ambition: Patrick Kluivert says Louis van Gaal will want to win the Premier League this season

United: Van Gaal will be assisted by Ryan Giggs and the pair chat to executive vice chairman Ed Woodward

VIDEO Van Gaal calls United the biggest club in the world  

‘He’s a great coach and I know he’s looking forward to taking over at Manchester United,’ the former Barcelona frontman told talkSPORT.

‘It will be a difficult year but I know he can do it. He can work well with the squad.

‘He’s absolutely going for the Premier League title. A club like Manchester United always has to go for the title and that’s what he wants in his first year.

‘They also need to get back into the Champions League.’

He added: ‘Van Gaal is a great tactician and he wants to win matches.

‘He likes to play offensive and attractive football as well though. He won’t disappoint the Manchester United fans.’

Future: Kluivert would love to follow Van Gaal to United

Ryan Giggs will be Van Gaal’s No 2 at United, although Kluivert would jump at the chance of joining forces again.

‘I talked with Van Gaal and he said he would have loved to have given me the opportunity at Manchester United, but there was somebody already in my position,’ he said.

‘I’m fine with it. I would have loved to come to Manchester United. I hope it can happen in the future, you never know.’
