Nick Clegg's plans for free school meals have been met with criticism with some Liberal Democrats even admitting the scheme is a 'waste of money'

Plans to hand free school meals to the under-8s across the country were mired in chaos last night  after senior Tories denounced  the proposal to pay for the lunches of affluent children.

Less than 24 hours after Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg revealed his plan to offer a hot lunch to every infant pupil, Liberal Democrat ministers were forced to admit they once branded the policy a waste of money.

In addition, London Mayor Boris  Johnson rejected the plans, saying that better-off families should pay for their children’s food.

‘I am in no means against getting parents who can pay for to pay for it,’ said Mr Johnson. ‘I have no problem with the concept of dinner money.’ 

Mr Clegg confirmed his £600million plan during his speech at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow yesterday.

It is due to be announced by Chancellor George Osborne in the Autumn Statement later this year.

But former Tory frontbencher David Davis said the scheme was incoherent, saying the Lib Dems have created a new universal benefit just as the Treasury is cutting child benefit for the better-off.

He said: ‘At a time when the Government is scaling back child benefit it seems very odd to add another universal benefit. 

‘It’s hard to understand why families in the best parts of Notting Hill should have free school meals, particularly since the free school meals available when I was a child would probably fail a health and safety test.’

Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, dismissed the plans saying that better off families should pay for their children's food

The Lib Dems also faced embarrassment 
after it emerged that they have opposed the very same policy when it was
 enacted by Labour councils in London.

A
 letter signed by the party’s deputy leader Simon Hughes surfaced 
yesterday in which he denounces the plans as a waste of money because it
 helped better-off families.

High Speed 2 will damage the environment and have a huge impact on irreplaceable ancient woodlands, a Lib Dem minister has said.

Agriculture Minister David Heath said the route of the fast rail line needed to be examined carefully because ‘you can’t grow old trees’.

He said officials would have to ‘look critically’ at the proposals for the £50billion railway linking London to Birmingham and on to Manchester and Leeds.

His Somerton and Frome constituency is not affected by the route, but Tory MPs in the Chilterns bitterly oppose the proposal. 

The Woodland Trust says HS2 will directly affect 33 ancient woods, and the noise and vibration will impact on habitats in another 34.

In a letter to a constituent, the MP for Southwark and Bermondsey said 
Labour-run Southwark Council was ‘wasting extraordinary amounts of 
money’.

‘They are spending £15million giving free school meals, some of this is going to the borough’s richest families, irrespective of whether they can afford to pay for them already.

Labour-run Southwark Council can’t get the basics right and act like they have money to burn. 

‘They are slashing projects that offer a hand up to those who need them – to fund handouts for those who don’t.’ Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said the Lib Dems can now afford to back the policy.

He said: ‘In the council in that area, which was cutting budgets all over the place, they were concerned about the allocation of resources in the council.

‘As a national policy, which is going to be funded by the central government, it removes that pressure and they were welcoming what we were doing.’ 

Lib Dem Education Minister David Laws also prompted confusion by claiming the £600million cost of the scheme could be funded by plugging tax loopholes.

It had been thought the money would be found by making further cuts in the education budget, but Mr Laws vowed that the money could be obtained from ‘tax loopholes that were abused by wealthy people’.
