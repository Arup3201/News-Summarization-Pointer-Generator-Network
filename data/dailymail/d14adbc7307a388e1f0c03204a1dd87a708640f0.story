President Barack Obama will discuss the situation in Ferguson, Missouri, Monday with his Cabinet, civil rights leaders, law enforcement officials and others.

The White House says Obama's Cabinet meeting will focus on his administration's review of federal programs that provide military-style equipment to law enforcement agencies.

The president will also meet with young civil rights leaders to discuss the challenges posed by 'mistrust between law enforcement and communities of color.'

He'll then meet with government and law enforcement officials, as well as other community leaders, to discuss how to strengthen neighborhoods.

Protests have continued in Ferguson, but have been more muted than the violence sparked last week by a grand jury's decision not to indict a police officer in the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.

It was announced Saturday that, despite the decision not to try him for any crime, Wilson had nonetheless resigned his commission with the police department.

The officer said he had given up on law enforcement so that the community could 'heal' after his actions ultimately caused national outcry and night of looting and fires. 

Nonetheless, a seven-day march is currently underway from Ferguson to Missouri's capital Jefferson City and Governor Jay Nixon's mansion to call for a change in police leadership.

Conflict: The President will address the contentious militarization of Ferguson's police force with federal funds

There have been riots, looting and buildings burned in Ferguson since Monday’s grand jury verdict. 

At least 16 protesters were arrested late Friday outside the Ferguson police department and after demonstrators shut down a shopping mall in St Louis, demanding a boycott of post-Thanksgiving shopping.

And on Sunday, five St. Louis Rams players stood with their arms raised in a show of solidarity for Ferguson protesters before trotting onto the field for pregame introductions at the Edward Jones Dome.

A Rams spokesman said on Sunday that the team was not aware the gesture had been planned before the game against the Oakland Raiders.

Wide receivers Tavon Austin and Kenny Britt came out together first, with the move obscured by a smoke machine in the upper reaches of the stadium.

Stedman Bailey, Jared Cook and Chris Givens - all of whom are black - then came out and stood together with arms raised.

After Tre Mason scored on an 8-yard run to make it 45-0 in the fourth quarter, the gesture made another appearance when he and Britt raised their hands together.
