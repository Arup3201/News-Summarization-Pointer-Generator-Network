The Walking Dead's midseason finale went out with a bang on Sunday as Beth Greene was shot dead by police officer Dawn Lerner after she stabbed her with a pair of hidden scissors.

Greene, played by Emily Kinney, was suddenly killed inside Grady Memorial as a tense prisoner exchange went wrong.

And her murder was soon followed by the death of Lerner, played by Christine Woods, who was shot dead in retaliation by Daryl.

Prisoner exchange: Beth stood her ground on Sunday's midseason finale of The Walking Dead

The episode titled Coda marked the midpoint of the 16-episode fifth season with the final eight episodes airing in 2015.

AMC irked some of its West Coast viewers when it updated its Facebook and Twitter feeds immediately after the show aired on the East Coast with a photo of Daryl carrying Beth looking as anguished as King Lear holding lifeless Ophelia.

The episode started with Bob Lamson trying to escape on foot and being chased down by Rick in a patrol car.

When Bob would not stop fleeing Rick ran him down with his car and begged Rick to let him come back.

'Shut up,' said Rick after he shot him dead and drove off in the car.

Back at the school, Father Gabriel found the remains of Bob Stookey's leg and had to escape from zombies after they broke out of the school.

Tough negotiator: Rick Grimes had his gun out while dealing with the prisoner exchange

He came back: Noah agreed to the trade in order to reunite Beth with Rick and his crew

'Please let me in!' he shouted as he approached the fortified church where Carl, Michonne and baby Judith were hiding out.

Using an axe Michonne broke down the barricade to let Gabriel in and the group was forced to flee through the church as they trapped the zombies inside.

While planning their next move from the church, Carl, Michonne and Gabriel joined up with Abraham, Glenn and their group.

Glenn revealed that Eugene had lied about knowing how to cure the outbreak and Michonne told Maggie that her sister Beth was still alive.

Coming together: Abraham and his group teamed up with the church group and they all went to Atlanta

At the hospital Beth and Dawn continued to talk until Officer O'Donnell confronted Dawn about her relationship with Beth and her leadership and they started fighting.

Beth stepped in to save Dawn during the fight by pushing O'Donnell down an elevator shaft to his death.

Back at the warehouse Rick negotiated with two police officers about exchanging them for Carol and Beth.

Two for two: Rick and Daryl readied their two hostages for the exchange

Dawn agreed to the trade and Rick and Daryl went into the hospital to complete the exchange.

To start Dawn sent over Carol to Rick in exchange for the first policeman before trading for Beth.

Dawn made things complicated by demanding her ward Noah in the trade for Beth, but Rick objected.

The leader: Rick squared off against Dawn during the prisoner exchange gone awry

'The boy wants to go home so you have no claim on him,' Rick told her.

But Noah stepped forward to get the deal done.

As Beth hugged him goodbye, Dawn told him cruelly: 'I knew you'd be back.'

Goodbye hug: Beth hugged Noah after he agreed to return in exchange for her freedom

But angry Beth was having none of it.

'I get it now,' she said as she pulled out a pair of scissors hidden in her cast and stabbed Dawn in the shoulder.

In the shocking pinnacle of the episode Dawn then shot Beth in the head.

Daryl swiftly moved in and with his own gun immediately killed Dawn in the same way.

The other police officers inside the hospital then called for a cease fire as the shocked group worked out what happened and offered Rick and his group to stay there.

Rick refused and left the hospital as Abraham's group arrived just in time to see Daryl carrying out Beth's body in his arms.

Swift response: Daryl immediately shot Dawn in the head after she killed Beth

Maggie broke down and collapsed to the floor as she saw her sister's lifeless body.

In the final scene after the credits, Morgan emerged from the woods to find where Gabriel had been standing out in front of the school.

He eventually entered the church and sat down at the alter ready for prayer before laughing at the scene around him with zombie corpses lying about.

Tragic ending: Daryl carried dead Beth out of the Atlanta hospital

Overcome with emotion: Maggie collapsed at the site of her sister's lifeless body

He then discovered a map with the name of Rick Grimes on it.

The map mentioned Washington DC but that was before they found out Eugene was lying about having a cure and convincing the crew to go there. 

The Walking Dead will return for its ninth episode on February 8.
