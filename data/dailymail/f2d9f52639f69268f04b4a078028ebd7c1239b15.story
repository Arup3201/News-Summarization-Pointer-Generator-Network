A gang of burglars spent four hours dismantling a wall 'brick-by-brick' to break into a jewellery shop.

The gang were caught on CCTV casually chatting and smoking as they broke into Grace and Co in Ashby de la Zouch, Leicestershire.

Once inside, the raiders - whose faces were covered with hoods or masks - smashed glass display cabinets and grabbed a number of Pandora bracelets and charms. The value of the stolen items is still being calculated.

The aftermath of the break-in after burglars mounted a four-hour operation to get through a wall into a jewellery shop

The shop's security cameras filmed the men outside the back of the shop as they took the external wall apart.

The raiders were also filmed inside the shop, where they stayed for only two minutes.

Shop manager Olivia Towey said: 'We have four hours of CCTV footage of them taking the wall apart, brick-by-brick.

'You can see them chatting and smoking. They seem to have known exactly what they were doing and what they were looking for.'

Police believe the men began making the hole in the wall at 12.30am on Friday and left the shop at about 4.30am.

Shop owner Mick McQuillan said: 'We sell a wide range of jewellery and watches but they were only interested in Pandora.

'Despite this, we are determined it will be business as usual - we have a Pandora promotion on this weekend and would like to thank Pandora for helping us get back on our feet so quickly.

'It is the first time we have had anything like this in three years of trading.

'Everyone has really pulled together and we can now trade as normal, although with upgraded security.'

Detective Constable Alf Doyle said: 'The owners of the shop are understandably angry and upset their property has been taken and they are keen to have it returned.

'The suspects spent some time outside the premises while they made attempts to break in. Anyone who was in the area between 12.30am and 4.30am may have seen them at the shop.

'It's likely those responsible will now try to sell the items.

'We would like to ask anyone who knows someone who has acquired a large quantity of Pandora goods, or anyone who has been offered Pandora goods to buy in suspicious circumstances, to call us.'
