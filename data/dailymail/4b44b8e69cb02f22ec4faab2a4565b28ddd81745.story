Train company bosses are enjoying huge salaries at a time when six out of ten passengers are dissatisfied with their train company, damning new figures reveal today.

More than half of train firms received a customer satisfaction rating of 50per cent or less in the latest survey.

Yet at the state-run East Coast line, where services are being run directly by the Government, there are eight directors on salaries of more than £100,000 a year.

East Coast Trains is paid for by the taxpayer and has as many as eight directors on salaries above £100,000

The East Coast information supplied showed that one director - almost certainly managing director Karen Boswell - was on a salary of between £161,000 and £180,000.

Two directors’ salaries came within the £121,000 to £140,000 band, and five other directors were on between £100,000 and £120,000 a year.

Meanwhile, none of the 18 other train operating companies were prepared to reveal how many of their directors were on six-figure salaries - even though the railway industry receives around £5billion a year from the taxpayer.

Network Rail's chief executive Sir David Higgins was on an annual basic salary of £560,000 as of March 31 last year

Critics accused them ‘hiding behind a veil of secrecy as they bleed passengers dry’.

Train
companies became the subject of fury earlier when passengers were hit 
by above-inflation fare rises - despite the poor punctuality and ‘cattle
class’ travel conditions faced by many commuters.

The
latest research by Which? shows that only 1 in 5 (22per cent) of train 
travellers feel their service is improving, despite the fare rises.

First
Capital Connect, which suffered severe disruption last week, was bottom
in the satisfaction league table of 19 rail companies with only 40per 
cent of passengers satisfied with its service.

Passengers said the service’s commuter trains were consistently overcrowded and poor value for money.

Northern,
First Great Western, South Eastern and Greater Anglia railways all 
fared poorly, with fewer than 45 per cent of passengers satisfied.

The results were compiled by Which? from responses from 7,500 regular train users.

Citing some of the feedback it received, Which? said: ‘One First Capital Connect customer told us: ‘The price has increased and the trains get more and more crowded. I never see any improvements for the extra money I am paying’.

‘And a Southeastern passenger said: ‘The prices are terrible, the service is bad and trains are often delayed, cancelled and dirty.’.

The survey also showed that 40per cent of train travellers are likely to cut the number of journeys following the recent inflation-busting price increases which have seen season tickets rise by an average of 4.2per cent but some fares soaring 10 per cent.

But a third of commuters said they did not have an alternative way of getting to work and ‘will just have to pay more’, says the report.

Overall, the report concluded, only 22 per cent of train users felt that things were ‘on the up.’

A spokesman for First Capital Connect rejected the findings - suggesting that some of the customers must have had an ‘axe to grind.’

‘This is questionable research which quizzed just 461 people online out of the 170,000 we carry every day,’ a spokesman said.

‘People chose to take part so many who did would have had an axe to grind.

Bob Crow, general secretary of RMT, said private rail companies were 'scandalous' for not disclosing salaries

‘A face-to-face survey by rail watchdog Passenger Focus which is audited by the Office for National Statistics that shows 81% of our passengers are satisfied or very satisfied with our service and 13% are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.’

But last month’s Passenger Focus study also showed fewer than half Britain’s train travellers think the railways are giving value for money - dropping to under a third for the worst performing operators.

Pay levels for executives on the tax-payer backed East Coast were obtained following a request under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act.

All other train companies insisted that they were not obliged to reply as the Freedom of Information Act did not apply to them as they were private companies.

Only one company, CrossCountry, was prepared to offer any pay-level details on a non-FOI request basis. Information from CrossCountry covered the year 2011. It showed the highest paid director - almost certainly managing director Andy Cooper - was on £222,000 including pension contributions.

Bosses at rail infrastructure company Network Rail (Network Rail), which is currently striving to meet punctuality targets on long-haul routes, are also enjoying fat cat salaries and packages with the lure of lucrative bonuses on top.

In the last few days rail passengers have endured some miserable travelling conditions, with an overhead power line problem in Hertfordshire leading to severe delays on busy commuter routes.

Network Rail’s chief executive Sir David Higgins was on an annual basic salary of £560,000 as of March 31 2012, while finance director Patrick Butcher was on £382,000.

Network operations chief Robin Gisby was on £360,000, as was infrastructure director Simon Kirby.

In addition to their salaries, the Network Rail chiefs stand to be paid performance-related bonuses running into hundreds of thousands of pounds.
