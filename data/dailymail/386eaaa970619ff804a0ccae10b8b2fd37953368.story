A Bronx man shot the mother of his children early Sunday morning, then tried to set her apartment on fire and kidnapped their two children, authorities said.

Fitz Edward, 29, stormed into his ex-girlfriend's Eastchester apartment around 5am and fired a shot at her.

He then started a fire and grabbed the children, five-year-old Nazie and two-year-old Mlyliah. Edward fled the scene with the kids, making his getaway in their mother's car.
