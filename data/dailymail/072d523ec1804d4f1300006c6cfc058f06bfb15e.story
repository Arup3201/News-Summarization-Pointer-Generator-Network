Ever found yourself craving a cuppa but decided that boiling the kettle was too much effort?

Well you’re in luck, because a fresh mug of tea is now available at the touch of a button – from your coffee machine.

Two British firms have joined forces to launch tea capsules which can be used in existing Nespresso machines.

The Cornish Tea Company will provide the leaves for a revolutionary pod made by Dualit – a brand best-known for its toasters and kettles.

Coffee drinkers have long enjoyed the merits of capsules, which provide instant hot drinks from machines made by Nespresso, Krups and Nescafe.

But now tea drinkers can enjoy the same benefits with Dualit pods which are filled with tea from the family-run Cornish company. 

The pods are also compatible with Dualit’s own range of coffee machines, but do not come cheap. A single cup of tea will cost 30p – 15 times more than a typical 2p tea bag. 

Duncan Bond, director of the Cornish Tea Company, said: ‘We are terrifically proud to be the first tea brand in the world to be launching a Nespresso-compatible capsule. It’s never been done before and it has tremendous global potential.

‘When tea bags were first introduced people said they’d never catch on, now they are 97 per cent of the market. This could have a similar impact.’ 

Mr Bond, who founded the business with his nephew in 2012, added: ‘Many of our consumers lead very busy lives and this is not only incredibly convenient – the quality of the cup of tea is absolutely, scientifically consistent every time.’

The pods were developed last year after High Court judges ruled Dualit’s coffee capsules – which can also be used in Nespresso machines – did not infringe owner Nestle’s patents.

The decision has blown open the tea and coffee capsules market, and Dualit has invested £1million in a new factory to meet the expected demand. 

The company started selling its own-brand tea capsules late last year but this is the first branded tea product to be made into a capsule. 

Dualit's Managing Director Leslie Gort-Barten said the Cornish Tea Company, based in Looe, Cornwall, was the perfect partner for the product.

'Cornish Tea are passionate, they are enthusiastic - they are player-managers in the same sense we are,' he said.

'The bigger a company gets, the more risk averse and blind to opportunity it can become. They weren't.

'I think Cornish Tea is a great company - it's a really good fit.'
