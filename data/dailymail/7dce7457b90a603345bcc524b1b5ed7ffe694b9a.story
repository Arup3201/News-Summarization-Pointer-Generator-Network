The weather phenomenon dubbed the Siberian Express caused record-breaking low temperatures in almost every single area in the central and eastern US on Friday prompting many to stay inside.

The freezing weather however is perfect for the red pandas at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden who enjoy playing in the ice and snow.

ABC reports that Lin, a two-year-old female panda, and Rover, a 9-year-old male panda are natives of the Himalayas and are accustomed to the cold weather.

I stand for the cold weather!: This Cincinnati Zoo  red panda stands for all that is cold and all that is cute 

'We get snow about the same amount, or a little less, than in New York City,' Michelle Curley, the zoo’s communications director, told ABC News.

'The red pandas LOVE it and cold weather,' she added.

The pandas adorably celebrate their love of the cold by splashing in the snow, climbing trees, and rolling around in the cutest way imaginable.

According to The Weather Channel, the blasts of cold air this weekend meant that more snow, sleet and freezing rain were likely to continue from the Southern Plains to the Southeast into next week.

If the weather stays as cold as its predicted, more adorable panda play is likely in the forecast too.
