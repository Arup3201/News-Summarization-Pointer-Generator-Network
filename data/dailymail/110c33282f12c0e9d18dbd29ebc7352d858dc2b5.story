Australia won't budge on its climate change stance in the wake of the G20 summit as it's on track to make substantial reductions in anyone's language, the Abbott government says.

Sunday's temperature scorched to over 40, while the world's leaders turned up the heat on the host, which resulted in the globe's largest economies declaring their support for strong climate action.

But Prime Minister Tony Abbott has defended the government's record, saying unlike  other nations, Australia will meet its emissions reduction target by 2020.

Tony Abbott confirmed the G20 will work together to adopt a protocol under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to present at the Paris climate conference in 2015

'We are doing a very great deal and I suppose given what we are doing we don't intend at this time to do more,' he said at a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Sydney on Sunday night.

The government resisted pressure to make climate change a priority issue at the Brisbane summit.

But the United States and China unveiled a surprise deal to tackle carbon emissions and President Barack Obama rallied rich nations to do more.

When asked whether Australia's climate change plan would change following the weekend's outcome, Mr Abbott said what the government was doing was very substantial.

'And our commitment on emissions reduction, five per cent on 2000 figures by 2020 is one way of putting it,' he said.

'But against business as usual it's actually a 19 per cent reduction, which is a substantial reduction in anyone's language.

'Unlike some countries which have made commitments and not met them we will meet this commitment.'

Mr Abbott reiterated his stance on coal and said it was going to be an important energy source for decades to come.

At the bilateral meeting, Mr Abbott and Ms Merkel established a joint working group to develop the Australian-German relationship.

Both leaders said it could be improved while Ms Merkel acknowledged both nations shared the same values on Russia and Islamic State.

Climate change wasn't on the formal agenda prepared by the Australian presidency, but supportive statements by US President Barack Obama over the weekend ensured its inclusion in the final statement.

The leaders agreed their future actions will support sustainable development, economic growth and certainty for business and investment.

The G20 will work together to adopt a protocol under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to present at the Paris climate conference in 2015.

'We encourage parties that are ready to communicate their intended nationally determined contributions well in advance,' they said.

'We reaffirm our support for mobilising finance for adaptation and mitigation, such as the Green Climate Fund.'

The UN-backed fund was set up to help poor countries deal with the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels and severe weather events.

The US this weekend committed $US3 billion to the fund, and Japan $US1.5 billion.

Following his address to the G20, Mr Abbott was questioned about Australia's commitment to climate change.

'This government has just passed through the parliament legislation to put into effect our emission reduction fund, a $2.5 billion fund,' said Mr Abbott.

'We aren't just talking about taking action about climate change, we are cracking on with the job.'

'Australia is a high performer when it comes to actually delving on real action when it comes to tackling climate change.'

'We'll be making further decisions at the right time. What we want to do is to take effective action against climate change which is consistent with strong economic growth.'

On Saturday US president Barack Obama said that no country was immune to the effects of climate change and that everyone must play a role in fighting the global phenomena.

'I want my daughters to be able to come back and I want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit,' he told an audience at the University of Queensland to loud applause.

Leaders of G-20 nations finalised a plan to boost global GDP by more than $2 trillion over five years by investing in infrastructure and increasing trade

'I want that there 50 years from now.'

Meanwhile, under pressure to jolt the stubbornly lethargic world economy back to life, leaders of G-20 nations finalised a plan to boost global GDP by more than $2 trillion over five years by investing in infrastructure and increasing trade.

The communique also revealed that leaders plan to jump start growth in part by creating a global infrastructure hub and it would help match potential investors with projects. 

They also aim to reduce the gap between male and female participation in the workforce by 25 percent by 2025.

Tony Abbott said countries will hold each other to account by monitoring implementation of their commitments to boost growth.

The International Monetary Fund and OECD will also play a role in monitoring progress and estimating the economic benefits.

The G-20 communique says if the $2 trillion initiative is fully implemented it would lift global GDP by 2.1 percent above expected levels by 2018 and create millions of jobs.

Abbott said countries have agreed more than 800 measures to spur the global economy, which the IMF says is facing a 'new mediocre.'

'The G-20 has delivered real, practical outcomes and, because of the efforts that the G-20 has made, this year, culminating in the last 48 hours, people right around the world are going to be better off,' Abbott said.

But with international agencies downgrading their global growth forecasts in recent months, the G-20 - which represents around 85 percent of the global economy - faces an uphill struggle to implement its plan. Growth in China and Japan has weakened and Europe is teetering on the brink of a recession.

Abbott said leaders unanimously agreed that expanding global trade would directly benefit countries and people around the world.

'Trade is a key driver of growth, perhaps the key driver of growth and we're focused on domestic reforms to facilitate trade as well as the importance of a strong global trading system,' Abbott said.
