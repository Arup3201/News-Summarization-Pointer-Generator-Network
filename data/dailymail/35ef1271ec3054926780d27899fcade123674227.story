Tell-all: Bristol Palin's memoir comes out this week

Bristol Palin finished third in ABC's 'Dancing With the Stars', but she hasn't finished trying to claw her way to the top.

The 20-year-old daughter of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin takes several shots at rival conservative daughter Meghan McCain, 26, her mother Cindy McCain and other frenemies in her new memoir.

'Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far', co-written with Nancy French, is due out this week from William Morrow, but ABC News today revealed details of what's in the tell-all book.

According to ABC, Ms Palin writes that the first time she met Meghan McCain, the young woman 'ignored us during the entire visit'.

This was just before Arizona Senator John McCain had officially recognized Sarah Palin as his running mate for vice president, but Ms Palin wrote that she 'had a sneaking suspicion I might need to watch my back.

'Every time we saw Meghan, she seemed to be constantly checking us out, comparing my family to hers and complaining. Oh the complaining'.

In the years since 2008, Ms McCain has fostered her own time in the limelight, appearing frequently as a young conservative pundit in media, blogging for The Daily Beast and constantly updating her 112,000 Twitter followers.

On June 17, the firebrand tweeted: '"Hi, I'm Meghan McCain" is in no way, shape or form a pickup line. Trust me honey, you'd know it if I was hitting on you'.

About the troubled ex-representative, she Tweeted: 'I am more curious to hear what the creators of Twitter think of Anthony 
Weiner resigning than any political pundits this morning...'

In her book, Ms Palin wrote about Cindy McCain, heiress to a beer fortune and second wife of the senator: 'I'd never seen people with so much Louis Vuitton luggage, so many cell phones, and so many constant helpers to do hair and makeup'.

Rival: Ms Palin writes that fellow conservative pundit Meghan McCain, daughter of politician John McCain, was unfriendly, 'checking us out', 'comparing my family to hers' and 'complaining'. 'Oh the complaining'

Primping and cell phones: Ms Palin claims Cindy McCain styles herself a 'queen', with 'helpers', expensive luggage and 'many cell phones'

Second wife: Cindy McCain's considerable wealth and connections helped her husband chase his political goals. Ms Palin writes that Mrs McCain offered to be a godmother to her son Tripp as soon as they met

Ms Palin wrote of Meghan McCain: 'Every time we saw Meghan, she seemed to
 be constantly checking us out, comparing my family to hers and 
complaining. Oh the complaining'.

On Cindy McCain: 'I'd never seen people with so much 
Louis Vuitton luggage, so many cell phones, and so many constant helpers
 to do hair and makeup'.

On Levi Johnston: He's a 'gnat' who 'cheated on me about 
as frequently as he sharpened his hockey skates'.

She wrote that Mrs McCain, almost eighteen years her husband's junior, looked 'like a queen' and 'held herself like royalty'.

In fact, Mrs McCain's considerable wealth and personal connections had helped her husband's political career immensely, and the fact that he left his first wife of fourteen years to be with her seemed not to slow his popularity down among social conservatives.

Ms Palin wrote that she was mystified when Mrs McCain offered to be a godmother to her unborn baby Tripp: 'I had just met her and I wondered why she wanted any type of guardianship over my child'.

According to ABC, Ms Palin seems to have saved her deepest jabs for former fianc√©e Levi Johnston, who has his own tell-all book scheduled for release this fall.

She refers to her baby's daddy as a 'gnat' who 'cheated on me about 
as frequently as he sharpened his hockey skates'.

She writes that while 
her parents allegedly 'accepted' her pregnancy, he wasn't so supportive, saying the 
child 'Better be a f**king boy'.

Ms
 Palin claims that Mr Johnston plied her with wine coolers before taking
 her virginity, then promised it wouldn't happen again until they were 
married.

That apparently didn't go as planned, as she would become pregnant with his child shortly after.

Later,
 she claims he admitted to seeing another woman while he was staying at 
the Palin home with her, and eventually, that he had gotten another 
women pregnant.

Star: Bristol Palin competed on 'Dancing With the Stars', and can now add 'author' to her list of credentials

Ms Palin also wrote about her pride and excitement in her mother's campaign, and her maternal instincts for her son Tripp, even going so far as to claim she had felt motivated to adopt a child after the Haiti earthquake.

According to ABC, the 20-year-old did not mention that she has earned hundreds of thousands of dollars speaking to Christian groups about abstinence.

It's a strange message to send to young people: go ahead and get pregnant out of wedlock as a teenager, and you can get rich and appear on TV in a glamorous dress.

And about 'Dancing With the Stars?' Ms Palin wrote that her failed fellow contestants treated her with cold stares.

It's hard to say which is more cut-throat, reality TV or politics. Bristol Palin inhabits both worlds.
