A man allegedly tried to rape a housekeeper in a Disney World hotel room.

The attempted sexual battery took place on Friday afternoon, authorities say.

The victim reportedly went into a room at the Art of Animation Resort that had its door open -- only to encounter a Hispanic man who tried to rape her, WFTV reports.

Authorities were called at approximately 2pm and found the woman crying in her work uniform, The Orlando Sentinel reports.

The woman suffered scratches on her chest and was taken to a hospital for further examination, WFTV adds.

The suspect is described as in his early 30s, 5-foot-8, 260 pounds, with dark hair, thin eyebrows, as well as a mole on the right side of his face

'Fortunately enough for her she was able to fight off the attack,' Ginette Rodriguez, with the Orange County Sheriff's Office told the channel.

The suspect is described as in his early 30s, 5-foot-8, 260 pounds, with dark hair, thin eyebrows, as well as a mole on the right side of his face, the Sentinel reports. He was also reportedly wearing a dark cap with red 'NYP' lettering as well as a white t-shirt with a red Air Jordan logo.
