Fiona Dickie: The beauty queen now struggles to wear stilettos as a result of the crash

A beauty queen received £18,000 in damages yesterday after a car crash left her unable to wear high heels comfortably.

Fiona Dickie, 24, was hit by a Suzuki 4x4 while driving, leaving her with back injuries that make slipping into stilettos a painful experience.

Incredibly, despite her injuries, the 24-year-old went on to win the Miss Edinburgh competition in 2010 following the collision in April the previous year, but her ability to take part in charity events has been limited because of continuing back pain.

She raised an action at the Court of Session in Edinburgh suing the other driver Mohammadreza Khandani, also of Edinburgh, for damages following the collision.

Khandani admitted liability but he wanted to pay around £3,500 but Miss Dickie wanted closer to £20,000.

The court heard that the accident occurred on April 10 in 2009 shortly after midnight in Edinburgh’s South Clerk Street as Miss Dickie returned home from working at a drinks promotion event.

She was left shocked and distressed and suffered bruising to her chest and pain in her neck and back. The sales manager went home after the accident but later phoned NHS Direct because she was in pain.

A nurse said she should consult her GP and she was subsequently referred for physiotherapy, where Miss Dickie was later diagnosed with chronic low back pain.

After deciding on the £18,000 compensation today, which included £10,000 for 'pain and suffering' judge Gordon Reid QC  said: 'The pursuer (Miss Dickie) is an attractive young woman and also carried out some work as a model, usually at charitable events.

'She did not wish however to have a career as a model.

'She was expected to wear high heels for this promotional work. Doing so aggravated her back.'

Mr Reid said that after she won the Miss Edinburgh contest her main duty was attend and take part in charity events.

'Her ability to participate in the usual range of such events was limited because of her continuing back pain,' he said.

'The pursuer felt she was letting people down by not participating in as many events as, but for her back pain, she would other wise have done. She gave as an example various fun runs in which she was not able to participate.

'In spite of her attractive looks and the promotional work which she carried out the pursuer was very much against women being employed on the basis of their looks.

'She strongly opposed the WAG (wives and girlfriends) culture and part of her purpose in wishing to become Miss Edinburgh was to encourage young girls to be independent, to be their own boss and not to rely on men,' he said.

'She has adopted a sensible attitude to her continuing back problems. Sje knows she can wear high heels but will suffer the next day for doing so. It seems to me that rather than being criticised she should be commended for her efforts

'In the present case it is abundantly plain on the evidence that since the accident she has complained of and suffered intermittent lower back pain. She did not suffer such pain before the accident.

'She is not exaggerating her injuries to enhance the value of her claim. If she is, it is a strange way of going about it. She returned to work, resumed part-time employment over and above her day job and continued her modelling and charity work,' he said.

The judge awarded her a total of pounds 18,281, including pounds 10,000 for her pain and suffering.
