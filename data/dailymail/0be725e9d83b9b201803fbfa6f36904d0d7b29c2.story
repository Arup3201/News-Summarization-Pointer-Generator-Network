Kacey Hambleton, two, died after her mother's boyfriend, Connor Gibson, 23, battered and shook her to death in April this year

A violent killer shook his girlfriend's two-year-old daughter with such ferocity that her fatal injuries resembled those of a car crash victim, a court heard today.

Connor Gibson, 23, was said to have had a violent 'flare up' during which he grabbed and battered Kacey Hambleton in an assault which left her crying in pain.

The youngster was later found unresponsive when police were called to her family home in Blackpool at around 10am in April this year.

Today at Preston Crown Court, Gibson, from Blackpool, admitted manslaughter after his not guilty plea to murder was accepted by the prosecution.

Kacey's mother Louise, 23, was visibly upset in the public gallery as prosecutor Mr Francis McEntee said a 'considerable amount of force' was used in the lead up to her daughter's death.

He said: 'The principal cause of death was catastrophic head injuries. The prosecution always said there is a matter of shaking that is now accepted by the defendant.

'In this case there are other injuries notably a significant injury to the abdomen. There was a violent assault in anger we know not what the trigger was, during which injuries were caused to the thigh, very significant bruising to the liver.

'Injuries the result of a forceful blow such as found in a car crash or fall from height, that may be consistent with a single blow.'

Mr McEntee added that Gibson then 'shook her to quell her, resulting in the most immediate cause of her demise.'

Kacey's father Russell Hambleton, 27, said: 'The whole family has been left absolutely devastated and heartbroken by Kacey's death. 

'My little princess is gone and I feel like my heart has been ripped out. Kacey was a beautiful little girl with so much to live for; she has been taken from us far too soon.'

Kacey was taken to Blackpool Victoria Hospital and was later airlifted to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool in a critical condition. She died 48 hours later.

It is not known what the trigger was for his attack. Gibson had no history of violence towards children.

Gibson was remanded in custody and the judge Mrs Justice Susan Carr told him: 'You have now pleaded guilty to the offence of manslaughter. I will be sentencing you for that offence on Friday.'
