With just days to go until the Supreme Court hears arguments that could pave the way for federal recognition of same-sex marriages, a new survey has revealed that public support for gay marriage is higher than ever.

According to the new poll, 58 percent of Americans now believe it should be legal for gay and lesbian couples to get married; compared to 36 percent who say it should remain illegal.

These latest findings show a dramatic change in public attitudes compared to just ten years ago, when public attitudes were almost an exact mirror image. In 2003, 37 percent favored gay nuptials, and 55 percent opposed them.

The poll, carried out for ABC News, shows support for gay marriage has grown sharply from a low of 32 percent in a 2004 survey, to a narrow majority for the first time only two years ago, and now a significant majority for the first time.

Views on basic social issues traditionally move slowly, but the results of this survey - and a Pew Forum poll from last month - show a remarkable transformation in public attitudes. 

The results show large advances across a range of age groups and politics persuasions. 

Amongst adults younger than 30, the ABC poll found that gay 
marriage is supported by 81 percent of those polled, compared 
with 44 percent of seniors. Both groups have seen a ten point 
increase since March 2011 and 20 points since 2004.

Republicans (34 per cent) continue to 
lag behind Democrats (72 percent) and independents (62 percent), yet 
Republican support is up 18 points since 2004. Support amongst 
conservatives has more than tripled in the past nine years and stands at
22 percent.

Over the past 20 years there has been a major changes in people's options about homosexuality and the majority of Americans now believe it is 'just the way people are' rather than something they choose

Amongst religious groups support is 
following a similar upward trend, among Catholics support now stands at 59 percent 
(up 19 points), Protestants at 70 percent (up 25 points) and 
evangelicals at 31 percent (up 24 points).

The ABC research also found Americans voting almost 2-l (64-33
percent) that gay marriage 'should be decided for all 
states on the basis of the U.S. Constitution' rather than by each state 
making its own law on the issue.

The Pew Forum released similar findings last month, including a major shift in 
views over the past ten years - with people polling in favor of gay 
marriage becoming the preferred choice in recent years.

The Pew research also found support for gay marriage trending upwards across all age groups with 
millennials the most in favor and older respondents less inclined to embrace change.
The same research also found evangelicals polling the least in favor of gay marriage when it came to polling based on religious persuasion.

Pew also polled on regional 
differences and found people in New England states such as Connecticut and New 
Hampshire most in favor of gay marriage and South Central states such as 
Texas and Louisiana, the least in favor of change.

The results mirror a change in tone from a number of senior political figures in the past 12 months. On Monday Hillary Clinton expressed her support for same-sex marriage, something President Obama and Vice President Biden did last year.

Within the Republican party, respected Ohio senator Rob Portman announced last Thursday that he had reversed his stance against gay marriage after his 21-year-old son, Will, came out to him and his wife.

Portman said the discovery that his son was gay had given him a 'new perspective' and understanding of why equal opportunities matter, although House Speaker John Boehner told 'This Week' on Sunday that he ‘can’t imagine’ his conservative views on gay marriage will ever shift.

Democratic politicians to have publicly spoken out in favor of gay marriage include Vice President Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton

Research by the Pew Forum shows that attitudes to gay marriage have changed significantly over the past ten years

Gay marriage today is legal in 
nine states and the District of Columbia, and civil unions are legal in 
eight more states (and were approved last week by the state Legislature 
in a ninth, Colorado). Thirty-one states ban gay marriage by 
constitutional amendment.

The
Supreme Court will hear arguments later this month in two separate 
cases that could pave the way for federal recognition of same-sex 
marriages, while also overturning state restrictions that deny same-sex 
couples the right to wed.

Supporters
of marriage equality argue that denying same-sex couples the right to 
marry violates the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection under 
the law.

The Supreme Court will hear the cases on March 26 and 27 and is expected to issue its opinions in June.
