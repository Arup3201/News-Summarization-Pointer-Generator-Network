Dealing with Britain’s debts must not be done solely through attacks on public pending and welfare, the Lib Dems said today.

In a swipe at the Tories, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said ‘there is such a thing as society’ as he warned the wealthiest must be made to pay their fair share.

He also used a speech to the Lib Dem conference in York to dismiss ‘feeble’ Tory attempts to claim the income tax cut as their own policy, and signalled people who earn up to £12,500 should pay no income tax at all.

Tory Chancellor George Osborne has said that another £25billion must be found after the election, which he wants to raise from cuts to housing benefit for young people and removing council houses from wealthy tenants.

But Mr Alexander rejected the idea, insisting tax rises on the richest should also be used to balance the books.

He told delegates: ‘There is still much to do in this Parliament and the next to pay down the deficit and secure the recovery. This must be done fairly.

‘And here’s where I have news for those on the right  – there is such a thing as society.

‘We cannot and will not rely only on cutting public spending and targeting welfare to finish the job.

‘That’s why we are committed to ensuring that the wealthiest pay their fair share.

‘We will find a way forward that underpins a stronger economy and delivers a fairer society.’

He warned that even with forecasts projecting the government running a surplus by 2018, ‘we will still have work to do to get our national debt burden down to safe levels’.

‘It would not be fair to leave that to our children,’ he added.

‘But we Liberal Democrats will also ensure that the state has the resources to fund the public services and infrastructure investment that our country needs.

‘And we will insist that the wealthiest make a proper contribution.’

Mr Alexander also made clear that raising the personal income tax allowance to £12,500 will be a key Liberal Democrat demand in any coalition talks after the 2015 election.

In 2010 the Lib Dems promised to increase the threshold to £10,000, which it will reach in April this year.

The Budget next month is expected to include a further £500 rise, which will come into effect next week, weeks before the general election.

Mr Alexander said: ‘We will fight the next election with our own ideas, our own policies, our own values - no one else's.

‘And I can tell you that a top priority in any negotiation will be our aspiration to raise the personal allowance dramatically again in the next Parliament.

‘To raise it to £12,500... That would be a further tax cut for working people of £500.

‘At our first fiscal event in the next Parliament, we would deliver another tax cut of at least £100.

‘A two term Lib Dem government would then be delivering a tax cut for working people of £1200 - that's £100 a month.’

He claimed the rise in the tax allowance was ‘forced through’ in the face of opposition from the Tory wing of the coalition., but the Conservatives were now trying to take the credit for the policy.

‘We have had to fight for this at every Budget and at every Autumn Statement since 2010.

‘And what a fight it has been. It started in those election debates when the Conservatives said 'we cannot afford it'.

‘In 2010 the Conservatives wanted inheritance tax cuts for millionaires, we fought for and delivered tax cuts for working people.

‘In 2011 the Conservatives wanted 'shares for rights', we fought for and delivered tax cuts for working people.

‘In 2013 the Conservatives wanted a tax break for married couples that excluded millions of families, we fought for and delivered - you guessed it - more tax cuts for working people.

‘Now, belatedly, some Tories are lamely trying to claim credit.

‘Don't get me wrong, it must be hard to be a Tory in a Treasury delivering so much Lib Dem policy, so it's no surprise if some of them have gone native.’
