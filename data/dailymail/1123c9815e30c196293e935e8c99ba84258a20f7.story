In a society that is becoming increasingly health 
conscious, yet more time crunched than ever, it is almost impossible to balance our social lives with our fitness regime.

But now you can have the best of both worlds thanks to latest new fitness craze about to land in the UK from the U.S.: fitness dance parties.

A-list favourite Barry's Bootcamp are teaming up with prestigious nightlife hotspot Mahiki to bring the clubbing fitness class to London.

The ultimate workout: Barry's Bootcamp have teamed up with nightclub Mahiki to open a Saturday night dance and fitness class

Dubbed 'the best workout in the 
world’ with celebrity fans including Katie Holmes, Jessica Alba, Jessica
Biel and Kim Kardashian, Barry's intense 60-minute 
class claims to burn 1000 calories per session - all whilst you're boogieing to your favourite tunes.

Barry’s Bootcamp have always championed a gym-as-nightclub setting with their dimly lit studios, 
flashing lights and pulse-pounding music.

But Joey Gonzalez, who established the parties over the pond in New York, wanted to take this concept to the next 
level.

He said: 'So, the Dance Party was an idea I had 
during the very first summer here in NYC. It was actually called Joey’s 
Dance Party and I taught it every single week.

'The original inspiration 
was caused by my reaction to the New York City nightlife. I was 
overwhelmed by all the Happy Hours, dinners and wild late nights people 
seemed to indulge in here, in the Big Apple and I wanted to provide 
people with another option.'

The first official Barry's Bootcamp and Mahiki 'Saturday night dance party' will launch in the capital on August 31 and there is a different theme every week, such as back to school, Fifty Shades Of Grey and Magic Mike.

The opening night will be a back to school theme and the studio will be decorated like a classroom, the lead trainer will be a teacher, other trainers will dress as prefects, and regular clients are monitors.

There will be an intense work-out while a live DJ from Mahiki spins motivational tunes and there's even detention for those who quit exercises early.

The workouts are tough, 60 minutes of 
hardcore cardio on Woodway treadmills, 
teamed with strength training using weights, bands and your own body. 
The class combines short, sharp intervals and very little rest. You are 
pushed to your limit and given just enough time to recover before do it 
again and again.

Guests in the £20 class will be served smoothie shots during class and some drinks afterwards before they get glammed up and make their way to Mahiki, where they will be on the guestlist.

'The idea comes from avid bootcampers who say they want 
to take advantage of a Saturday night class, doing something fun, 
healthy and club-y before they go out,' said a Barry's spokesman.

The new Barry's studio opened in Euston in February and boasts changing rooms filled with luxury Malin + Goetz products,
candles, hair dryers and straighteners, plus a fuel bar and a social 
area where bootcampers can relax on sofas and enjoy a post-workout 
protein smoothie.

Barry Jay launched the first bootcamp
in 1998 and there are now eight studios across America, one in Norway 
and two more studios planned for Boston and Miami.

Brothers Sandy and James Macaskill 
are responsible for bringing the class to the UK after being blown away 
by the workout while in America.

Joey adds: 'People are looking for 
alternatives to the typical Saturday night as health, wellness and 
fitness have become more integrated into our culture and lifestyle.

'It’s
almost as if they are looking to redefine their lives. Shockingly, 
we’ve adopted a cult following of people who ONLY attend the Dance 
Parties. Crazy right?'
