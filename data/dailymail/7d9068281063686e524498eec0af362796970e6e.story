A 30-year-old man is in the custody of U.S. Immigration officials after being held captive for ten days inside a home in Houston.

The man escaped from the house in the southwest area of the city yesterday, wearing nothing but his underwear and shackles.

He was discovered after a neighbor called 911 after seeing the man scale a fence.

Escaped: A man in shackles and wearing only his underwear told police he escaped from a southwest Houston home where he had been held captive for over a week

The neighbor, who does not want to be named, gave the man clothes and water and then listened as the two waited for police.

'He had chains on his ankles with locks on them, coming up to his hands. He had a little 2x4 that he had pulled out of the wall,' explained the neighbor.

The man told the neighbor he had made it from Honduras to McAllen, Texas. He had apparently been lured to Houston on false promises and for the past ten days had been held captive.

He had been held prisoner inside a room in the home, where he was taunted with guns.

Prisoner: The man, believed to be 30 and from Honduras, said he fled on Wednesday afternoon after being held for about ten days in a house in southwest Houston

His captors, a woman and a man in his late teens, reportedly wanted $3,000 from their hostage’s family.

'He was nervous. He was asking if they were going to send him back. I said, don’t even worry about that,' recalled the neighbor to KHOU.

A SWAT team surrounded the home after receiving the 911 call. They stormed the house but the place was empty.

'SWAT did tell us, all of the windows are boarded up with plywood, and that’s a pretty good indication that he was being held against his will, and they didn’t want anybody in the neighborhood to know,' said Houston Police Department spokesman John Cannon.

Alert: A neighbor discovered the man escaping through the window of this house and then alerted police

The immigrant said that there were others held against their will in the house. Police are now investigating the claims and looking for the captors

The search is now underway for the two suspects, although officers have not found anyone so far.

The pair started renting the home around a month ago.

'I’m surprised because I never hear nothing bad. The neighborhood is quiet. Nothing has ever happened over here,' said neighbor Alba Acosta to KHOU.

Police are also considering the possibility that others may have been held captive at the property over the past month.
