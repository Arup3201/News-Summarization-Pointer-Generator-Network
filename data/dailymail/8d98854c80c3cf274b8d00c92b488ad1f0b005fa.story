Two convicted cannibals have been rearrested in Pakistan after a young boy's head was discovered in their home.

The gruesome discovery of a three-year-old's head was made in the house of Mohammad Arif Ali, 35, and his brother Mohammad Farman Ali, 30.

The pair, from the small town of Darya Khan in the country's interior, had previously served two years in jail for cannibalism and were only released last year.

Abdullah added: 'We raided the house on Monday morning and found the head of a young boy.

'We have arrested one of the brothers, Mohammad Arif, and are conducting raids for the arrest of the other brother.'

Police were searching nearby graveyards to see if they had been disturbed, he said.

The pair were initially jailed after police found that the corpse of a 24-year-old woman had disappeared from its grave in 2011.

Further investigations led officers to the brothers' house where they found a cooking pot containing meat curry.

The brothers were later arrested by police and jailed for two years.

They had once both been married with children, but their wives are said to have left them ahead of being detained by police three years ago.
