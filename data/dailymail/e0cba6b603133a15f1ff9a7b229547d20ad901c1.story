Britain is bracing itself for a wet weekend as tree leaves turn gold and brown for autumn.

But despite the seasons changing, the country will enjoy temperatures as high as 17C - which is around 3C above average.

Forecasters said Tayside, Scotland, and parts of Northern Ireland could see as much as 60mm of rain tomorrow as wet weather spreads from the rest.

Dan Williams, a spokesman for the Met Office, said: 'It will be pretty autumnal this weekend with some sun and showers - but it will be milder than average.

'We have got some rain coming through from the west from this afternoon, mainly over northern areas.

'The south-east will see some light stuff from the early hours of tomorrow. Further north, it will be particularly wet as we start the day.

'For most parts of the country through the afternoon there will be bright spells here and there but some showers in Northern Ireland, Scotland, the north-east and Wales.'
