A father has been banned from being alone with his eight-year-old daughter after telling police he accidentally accessed child porn while attempting to download music from the internet.

Nigel Robinson says his life has been plunged into a nightmare since he reported himself to authorities as an act of good citizenship.

When the 43-year-old plumber told police he had inadvertently downloaded shocking pictures of ‘young girls’, officers contacted social services.

His laptop was seized and – because of
lengthy waiting times for police analysis of computers in non-urgent 
cases – the investigation could mean he is not allowed to be alone with 
his daughter for a year.

Mr Robinson claims he is being treated like a criminal for trying to do the right thing.

‘When I saw these images I wanted to 
do something about it,’ he said. ‘I didn’t want anyone else’s children 
to be exploited in this way.

‘I can categorically state 1,000 per 
cent there will be nothing inappropriate on my computer other than the 
files I told the police about.

‘I can understand there needs to be 
caution. It is a very serious matter, but to be told it may be a year 
before the conclusion is just madness. I cannot take my daughter to the 
park, swimming or anything.

‘It has been a nightmare. I feel like I
am guilty until proven innocent. That is not the way I understood the 
British justice system to work.

‘I wish I had just binned the laptop and then none of this would have happened.

‘Whoever was uploading this will be miles away by now, yet I’m under the finger of suspicion.’

Mr Robinson, from Hull, said he was 
trying to download an album by the rock guitarist Slash from a 
file-sharing website – which he accepts is itself illegal – when the 
incident happened. Despite the practice being against the law, millions 
of people obtain music for free in this way.

When he opened the folder of files he 
had downloaded, which he says he believed contained music, he found 
files with girls’ names.

‘When I opened some of them up, I 
realised they were young girls,’ he said. ‘I immediately called my wife.
I was panicking. I asked her what she thought I should do and her 
response was to call the police.

‘I was willing to take it on the chin 
for downloading the music. I half expected to get arrested for that but 
felt it was important because someone was obviously uploading this.’

Mr Robinson phoned Humberside Police 
and was told statements would need to be taken by officers and also East
Riding of Yorkshire Council’s social services department.

It was at these interviews that he 
learned he would not be allowed unsupervised access to his daughter 
until the investigation was over.

The order was put in place in November and detectives warned Mr Robinson it could be a year before the laptop was examined.

Yesterday his wife Liz, 32, a care home assistant manager, spoke about the problems the family now faced.

When she worked a night shift, she 
said, she had to arrange for someone to be in the house with her husband
or send their daughter to her grandmother’s house. ‘Why does my 
daughter have to suffer? Technically my daughter could miss a year of 
her life with her dad,’ she said. ‘I think it’s bureaucracy gone mad.’

Police confirmed the inquiry could take a year to complete as the case has ‘to go in a queue’.

A spokesman said: ‘We are conducting 
an investigation that has resulted in the confiscation of a laptop, in 
order for the relevant inquiries to take place.

‘This is a standard procedure for this type of investigation.

‘The laptop is sent away to be 
examined and, as this forms the basis for a number of different 
investigations, Humberside Police has no control over the amount of time
it takes for the laptop to be returned.’

East Riding social services said the 
access ban was ‘a proportionate response’ based ‘on the information it 
presently has about this case’.
