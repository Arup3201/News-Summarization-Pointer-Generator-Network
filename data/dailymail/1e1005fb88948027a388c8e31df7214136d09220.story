Political opposites turned friends, former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush launched a new scholars program at four presidential centers with an opening act that might have been mistaken for a comedy routine.

The two former presidents - one a Democrat, the other a Republican - shared laughs and a buddy-like banter on stage Monday, talking about presidential leadership while trading stories about their famous families and life after the White House.

Bill Clinton said he and Bush laughed backstage about people coming up to them at restaurants and asking to take 'selfie' photos. Quipped Bush: 'At least they're still asking.'

In stitches: Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush appeared together Monday, to announce a leadership series which will be taught at four presidential libraries across the nation

Flattery: The two kept the talk light, avoiding any tangent into current President Barack Obama's issues with ISIS. Instead, they spent much of the time complimenting each other 

The new autograph: Clinton and Bush also reflected on what it's like to be a former president today, like being asked in restaurants to take selfies with strangers

With Hillary Rodham Clinton seated in the fourth row, Bush noted that many people ask him about the possibility of another Bush-Clinton White House campaign. His father, President George H.W. Bush, lost to Clinton in 1992, and his brother, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, may seek the GOP nomination in a race that could pair him against Hillary Clinton.

'The first one didn't turn out too good,' Bush quipped.

The 42nd and 43rd presidents joined together to announce the Presidential Leadership Scholars program, a partnership between the Clinton, Bush, George H.W. Bush and Lyndon B. Johnson presidential centers.

At a time of partisanship and gridlock, both presidents said they hoped the scholars program would attract people in business, public service and the military interested in learning about presidential decision-making and applying it to their own careers.

Clinton revealed that he and Bush would speak twice a year during Bush's second term, 30-to-45 minute conversations about policy and politics. While they didn't always agree, Clinton said he never talked about their discussions and said the talks 'meant a lot to me.'

Clinton said the test of any democracy is finding ways of having a vigorous debate and still reaching resolution to the nation's problems. 

'If you read the Constitution, it ought to be subtitled: "Let's make a deal,"' Clinton said.

Confidante: It was revealed during the talk that Bush called Clinton twice a year, during the second half of his presidency, to discuss the world for 30-45 minutes. He says the chats 'meant a lot to me'. 

Bush Sr: The two also spoke at length about Bush's father, former President George H.W. Bush, praising the elder Bush who Clinton beat in the 1992 election 

The elder Bush got in the act from afar, writing in a letter read aloud that every former president displays different qualities, 'for example, not all of us skydive.'

Bush, who celebrated his 90th birthday in June by making a tandem parachute jump, urged the two former presidents to 'keep it brief.'

The event had a light-hearted tone. Bush offered Clinton advice on becoming a grandparent - Clinton's daughter Chelsea is expecting her first child this fall. 

'Get ready ... to be like the lowest person in the pecking order in your family,'Bush said.

At one point, Clinton's cellphone rang on stage, prompting him to tell the audience that 'only two people have this number and they are related to me.' 

The best of friends: Despite being political opposites, Clinton and Bush have forged perhaps the closest relationship between any two former presidents

Like family: Clinton has previously referred to Bush as his 'brother from another mother' and the 'black sheep son' of the Bush family

Clinton said he hoped 'I'm not being told I'm about to become a premature grandfather.'

Assessing each other's leadership qualities, Clinton said Bush did things he thought was right and 'consistently benefited by being underestimated - and so did I for totally different reasons.' 

Bush said Clinton was empathetic and 'an awesome communicator' who could 'really lay out a case and get people all across the political spectrum.' 

Ending his comments, he asked Clinton: 'Is that enough?'

Proud: Bush also gave Clinton some advice on being a grandparent, since daughter Chelsea Clinton is expecting her first child. Bush pictured above with his granddaughter Mia

George W. Bush campaigned for president in 2000 on restoring 'honor and dignity' to the White House following Clinton's impeachment over a sex scandal. But the two former presidents have developed a bond, strengthened by their mutual admiration for the elder Bush, whom Clinton visited in Maine last week.

Clinton and the younger Bush worked together on relief efforts after Haiti's devastating earthquake in 2010 and have been active in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Africa.

Bush noted that his upcoming book, called '41: A Portrait of My Father,' would be a 'love story. It's a story about seeing someone you admire and learning from them.'

As moderator Josh Bolten humorously plugged the book's November 11 release date, Clinton mused about writing his own competing Bush 41 book. 'I think I can put one together that would be ready to go,' Clinton joked.
