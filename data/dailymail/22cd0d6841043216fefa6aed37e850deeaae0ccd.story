Tesco has been forced to pull a line of its own-brand frozen meatloaf from its shelves after tests revealed the product contained up to five per cent horse meat.

The admission last night came less than two weeks after shoppers were reassured that tests on  meat products on sale in British supermarkets had been completed.

The supermarket giant apologised to its customers after confirming that packs of its Tesco Simply Roast Meatloaf had become the fourth of its products to test positive for horse meat contamination.

Withdrawn: Tests revealed traces of horse meat in packs of Tesco's frozen Simply Roast Meatloaf

It follows the British Retail Consortium's announcement on March 1 that supermarket chains had completed testing on minced beef products, and that the latest round had found no traces of horse DNA.

The emergence of the tainted meatloaf at Tesco is the latest development in the scandal that began in January, when Irish food inspectors announced that traces of horse meat had been discovered in frozen beef burgers being sold at a number of UK supermarkets.

It has since engulfed major stores and brands including Asda, Burger King, Findus and Birds Eye, and a new survey has revealed the impact of the furore on the nation's shopping habits.

Tesco's frozen meatloaf is the latest in a string of beef products recalled by UK food firms and supermarkets since the horse meat scandal first hit the headlines in January.

A first wave of tests found horse DNA in products including Aldi's special frozen beef lasagne and special frozen spaghetti bolognese, Co-op frozen quarter-pounder burgers, Findus beef lasagne, Rangeland's catering burger products, and Tesco Value frozen burgers and Value spaghetti bolognese.

A second round revealed contamination of Asda's chilled beef bolognese sauce, beefburgers, minced beef and halal minced beef sold by Sodexo, which supplies food to schools, care homes and the armed forces, and a Whitbread Group lasagne and beefburger.

The third wave revealed contamination of Bird's Eye Traditional Spaghetti Bolognese and Beef Lasagne, Taco Bell's ground beef and Brakes' spicy minced beef skewer.

Ikea also withdrew wiener sausages in the UK last month after tests found 'indications' of horse meat, and it also withdrew a batch of its traditional meatballs.

The company said it was removing the sausages from sale in Britain, France, Spain, Ireland and Portugal after tests confirmed 'a few indications of horse meat'.

It showed three in five people have changed their eating habits in the wake of the scandal that continues to rock the food industry.

Nearly a third are buying less processed meat, such as burgers, while one in four now avoid meat-based ready meals.

Tesco said it had pulled the 600g packs of 
Tesco Simply Roast Meatloaf, made between October last year and January 
at Eurostock in Craigavon, Northern Ireland, from its shelves.

Tim J Smith, its group technical director, said: 'Tests on 15 other 
lines from the same manufacturing site were clear of horse meat.

'Our investigation to thoroughly understand the source of the 
contamination has started and we will complete our investigation before 
deciding whether to continue using the supplier.

'We are very sorry that we have had a further product which has failed to meet the high standards we and our customers expect.'

He said the company had now tested 500 product lines.

Along with retailers, schools, care homes and hospitals have also been drawn into the controversy after unwittingly serving tainted beef.

Consumer group Which? found that buyers’ trust in the food industry has fallen by a quarter, while 60 per cent have changed their spending habits.

The organisation wants the Government to take urgent steps to ensure food labels are accurate, and for more random testing to be introduced. It says the Food Standards Agency should have greater powers to investigate and enter premises where food fraud is suspected.

The survey, conducted late last month, also revealed that two-thirds of people (68 per cent) do not think the Government has been giving enough attention to enforcing labelling laws, with half of consumers (50 per cent) not confident that ingredient information is accurate.

It found that 44 per cent now spend more time looking at the ingredients label on meat products, with 83 per cent agreeing that country of origin labelling should be required on such items.

Confidence in food safety has also dropped, from nine in 10 feeling confident when buying products in the supermarket before the scandal broke to seven in 10 feeling confident now.

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'The horse meat scandal exposed the need for urgent changes to the way food fraud is detected and standards are enforced. These serious failings must be put right if consumers are to feel fully confident in the food they are buying once more.

Tests: The tainted packs of meatloaf were manufactured at Eurostock in Craigavon, Tesco said

'Ministers must ensure that everyone involved, including their own departments, the Food Standards Agency (FSA), the food industry and local authorities, are crystal clear about their responsibility to protect consumers and are properly equipped to do so.'

Which? has called on the Government to take five 'urgent' steps, including more surveillance that is better co-ordinated between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the FSA and local authorities, and the immediate scrapping of proposals to decriminalise failure to comply with food labelling legislation.

It also wants the food industry to improve traceability, labelling and testing of products, with the responsibility for labelling policy returned to the FSA from Defra.

Which? said: 'Consumers should know what's in their food and where it's from.

'The Government should push for the EU-wide country-of-origin labelling to cover processed meat used in meat products, like ready meals.

'It should also scrap its plans to drop national rules requiring clear ingredient labels for meat sold loose, like in a delicatessen.'

It added: 'The scandal shows this split (between Defra and the FSA) causes unnecessary confusion and complication. The Government should now move responsibility for labelling and standards responsibilities back to the FSA.'

Populus surveyed 2,064 UK adults online between February 22 and 24.
