City trader: Robin Clark, pictured, was shot in Shenfield, Essex, on Friday morning and police are investigating whether he had debt problems

An indebted city trader was shot by an attacker wearing a black balaclava as he went to catch an early morning train to work - and police are probing whether the attack was connected with his money problems.

Robin
 Clark, 44, was getting out of his vehicle in a railway station car park
 with a male friend at around 5.45am yesterday when he was approached by
 the mystery gunman who shot him once in the thigh before fleeing.

Mr Clark, who works at brokers firm RP 
Martin, was attacked at Shenfield railway station in Essex before being rushed to nearby Basildon Hospital with serious leg 
injuries.

Police sources described the shooting as 'some kind of revenge attack'.

It's understood that Mr Clark, who is believed to have owned three Porsches, has financial problems. In April 2013, a county court judgment was filed against him for debts of £14,653.

And the twice-divorced father of four last year moved out of the £2.2million five-bedroom 
house he rented in nearby Ingatestone, Essex, amid the debt issues.

A
 police source confirmed officers were investigating the possibility the
 man was shot down by a love rival or because of problems with money.

The source said: ‘It’s clear that he meant the shot to be a punishment rather than to kill. It’s some kind of revenge attack.’

Meanwhile friends of Mr Clark spoke of his party-loving lifestyle, describing him as a 'high octane city boy.'

Referring to new Martin Scorsese film The Wolf Of Wall Street, which chronicles the hedonistic life of a trader, sources described Mr Clark affectionately as 'the Wolf of Shenfield' to The Sun as he 'plays hard and loves the ladies'.

His classic car-dealing friend Steve Hurn told the paper that Mr Clark had a love of classic cars, particularly Porsches.

Mr Clark is said to have saved the life of a female colleague from the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York, after urging her to flee from the World Trade Center's south tower before the second plane struck, according to The Times.

PA Janice Brooks was working on the 84th floor of the building when the first plane struck the north tower. Mr Clark immediately phoned her from London and told her to evacuate. She escaped down an emergency staircase.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Iain Miller, from British Transport Police, said: ‘We 
are able to confirm that a 44-year-old man from Essex arrived at 
Shenfield railway station this morning in a car shortly before 6am.

Robin Clark was rushed to nearby Basildon Hospital suffering serious leg injuries which are not thought to be life-threatening

‘He was on his way into work in London when the incident occurred. As he got out of the car he was approached by an unknown man and received a single gunshot to the leg.

‘The man, wearing a balaclava, ran from the scene of the incident and made off at speed in a vehicle parked nearby.

‘Officers from BTP and Essex Police attended the station, and the incident was reported to BTP at 5.51am.

‘The man was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, with serious injuries, which are not believed to be life-threatening.

‘At this stage of the investigation, police cannot confirm the vehicle or weapon used.’

Former home: Mr Clark had lived in this £2.2million house in the village of Stock, Essex

No arrests have been made at this stage and the reason for the shooting remains unclear

Targeted attack: Witnesses described hearing a loud bang 'like a car backfiring'

Vehicle: Mr Clark's Ford S-Max was towed from the scene

Detective
 Superintendent Gary Richardson, who is leading the investigation, 
added: ‘At this stage we believe the victim of this assault was 
deliberately targeted.

‘We do not believe this incident was 
gang-related and I would like to reassure the public that there is no 
reason for any undue concern.’

A taxi driver, who heard the shot being fired, said: ‘I heard a really loud bang but I just assumed it was a car backfiring.

‘You don’t expect people to be running around with guns in a place like this. It’s a nice area with lots of expensive houses.’

Affluent Shenfield is just a short 24-minute train journey from central London and it is a popular town for city workers.

Mr Clark works as a euro derivatives trader at RP Martin, a brokerage firm in the City of London.

According to a LinkedIn profile in his 
name, Mr Clark joined RP Martin in June 2013 after a seven-year stint at
 U.S. firm BGC Partners.

A spokesman for the firm yesterday said: ‘We are aware of this morning’s incident and are giving Robin all the support we can.’

Dozens of armed officers from Essex Police were scrambled to the scene while a large section of the car park was taped off

Mr
 Clark, who has four children aged eight, 11, 14 and 18, had previously 
studied at the prestigious Duke University in North Carolina.

His
 first wife Natalie, 42, who lives in Epping, Essex, last night said: 
‘We have been divorced for 10 years and have two sons. This has left me 
very shaken.’

Second wife Rhea, 33, who lives in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, declined to comment.

Mr Clark was last night still receiving treatment in hospital.

Rail services in and out of London resumed at the station after being suspended for a short while earlier this morning.

One
 commuter said: 'There were loads of police cars blocking the entrance 
to the car park and there were police cars outside the entrance to the 
station.

'There were a number of ambulances. We weren’t being told anything initially but it transpired there had been a shooting.'
