It's the part of the evening everyone hates - tackling the mountain of washing up that has accumulated throughout the day.

But thanks to a new invention, the days of arduously cleaning plates and bowls might be over.

Known as the Bake.A.Dish, the machine can make kitchenware out of bread that can hold all sorts of food from soup to curry.

Is this the future of kitchenware? This odd kitchen gadget banishes the arduous chore of washing up after meals - because it bakes edible plates and bowls.
The clever machine makes kitchenware out of bread using a top secret process that can hold any kind of food including soups and other liquid-based meals

The gadget can make bowls and plates of any size up to 16 inches (41 centimetres) in diameter.

These can then be eaten at the end of a meal.

Another device that could be set to alter the way people live is Luna.

The Luna concept is a metallic sphere with a small amount of water in it that can turn your laundry basket into a washing machine.

It creates a cloud of fine particles of steam electrostatically charged, which comes out through pores of the metal surface.

It then rotates and moves between clothes through vibrations and pulses designed to scrub and shake tissues, loosening dirt.

The
 metallic surface of the sphere acts as a magnet: electrostatically 
charged, it attracts dirt particles impregnated with steam and sucks 
these towards the core of the sphere.

Finally, Luna dries with hot air the residual damp in the tissues.

The device can be controlled by a mobile phone app, which calculates the size of the bowl or plate according to how many calories the user needs.

Bake.A.Dish is the work of industrial design student Saeed Rahiminejad.

It is a contender for the Electrolux Design Lab 2014 awards, and the designer is now seeking funding to help put his concept into production.

Rahiminejad, 26, from the Iranian capital Tehran, says: 'The product is aiming at personalising your dinnerware, making a more sustainable alternative to disposable dinnerware and adding a fix of fibre to one's daily diet.

'By customising the size of the food dishes according to one's special needs and adding a controlled amount of fibre and carbohydrates to the diet it promises a healthier eating lifestyle.

'You also get to eat hot, fresh baked goods whenever you want.'

Rahiminejad added how a two part shape-shifting mold enables bowls and plates of differing sizes to be made.

'The possibilities are endless, and all you need is flour and water,' he continues.

'The
 first thought that comes to mind about bread dinnerware is that they 
couldn't possibly hold liquids and they're not that strong.

'But
 I have a solution for making the bread hold any kind of food without a 
worry, although I can't reveal it because it's secret.

'The
 energy needed for making these breads comes from solar panels and the 
water used for baking is less than that used to wash dishes.

'That makes Bake.A.Dish a good sustainable solution and ultimately is fun.'

The machine can be controlled by a mobile phone app (shown here) that calculates the size of the bowl or plate according to how many calories the user needs. It can make bowls and plates of any size up to 16 inches (41 centimetres) in diameter which can then be eaten at the end of a meal

The Bake.A.Dish gadget, a contender for the Electrolux Design Lab 2014 awards, is the brainchild of industrial design student Saeed Rahiminejad, who is now looking for funding to help put it into production
