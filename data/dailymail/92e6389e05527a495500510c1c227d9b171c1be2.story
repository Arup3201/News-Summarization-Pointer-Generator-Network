Former Melbourne Storm cheerleader Jinelle Esther landed the job of a lifetime when she was chosen for the iconic Dallas Cowboy cheer squad in March last year. 

The 27-year-old from East Hawthorn, Victoria, had to audition with 500 others from around the world before being selected for the final 18, who progressed to training camp, where just 12 were selected for the team.

Since being chosen for the team, it has been a whirlwind adventure for the bubbly cheerleader, who said that she feels blessed to have the opportunity to do what she loves.

'Becoming a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader has been an absolute dream come true,' Jinelle told Daily Mail Australia.

'I am so honoured to be one of 36 women chosen to represent such an iconic organization. It has been a lifelong goal, and it feels incredible to have this opportunity to do what I love most.'

Jinelle has been cheering since she was ten years old, starting out as a performer for her local Melbourne soccer club before cheering professionally in Australia for seven years.

'For two of those years I danced for the National Basketball League, Melbourne Tigers, and then joined the National Rugby Leagues' Melbourne Storm squad,' said Jinelle.

'This team quickly became my family for the next 5 years, where I gained life skills and experiences that have helped shape me to become a more well rounded, confident person.'

Being one of two Australians on the Dallas Cowboy cheer squad, along with Angela Rena, Jinelle said that Dallas can sometimes feel a long way from home.

'I miss my family and friends everyday. The toughest part about being so far away is the time difference and not being able to communicate as easily with the people I love,' Jinelle said.

'I have also come to truly appreciate how beautiful Australia's beaches are. I miss being able to enjoy some of the most incredible coast lines in the world!'

Despite her homesickness, Jinelle said that she has come to love living in the United States, and spending so much time with her 'cheer family' has meant she has experienced a side of American life she didn't expect.

'Driving on the other side of the road was definitely an interesting learning experience. A few unforced errors helped me quickly adapt to Texas traffic!' Jinelle said.

'I also really enjoy being immersed in a new and welcoming, southern culture. I appreciate the hospitality the locals have shown me, and have loved getting to experience new festivals and holidays such as Halloween, 4th of July, and Thanksgiving!'

It's not all fun and games for the cheer squad though, who balance full-time jobs outside of their commitment to the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders.

In order to be prepared for the games, shows, and appearances, the squad trains five nights a week for anywhere between three and eight hours a night to perfect routines, the kick line and the iconic jump splits.

Jinelle said that she finds exercise to be essential in her day. 

'Whether it's going for a peaceful walk, or running a marathon, exercising helps you to feel balanced and healthy,' Jinelle said.

'In addition to being physically active, it is important to treat food as fuel and resist cravings for products filled with chemicals and preservatives that are toxic to your body,' she said.

'My favourite way to exercise is to take Zumba classes! It's the perfect combination of cardio and toning, and the music is motivating and engages you in the routines.'
