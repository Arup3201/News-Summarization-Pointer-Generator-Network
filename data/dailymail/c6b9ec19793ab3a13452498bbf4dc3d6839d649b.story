A longtime suspect in the disappearance of Etan Patz will be freed on Wednesday from a Pennsylvania prison where he spent more than 20 years for molesting other children.

Etan, 6, vanished May 25, 1979, after leaving his Lower Manhattan home to go to a bus stop two blocks away. It was the first time his parents had let him go off to school alone.

Jose Ramos, a convicted pedophile whom authorities have called the prime suspect in the case, is set to be released Wednesday from the State Correctional Institution at Dallas, in northeastern Pennsylvania, prison spokesman Michael Goyne said.

'He will be released probably sometime in the morning,' Goyne said. 'That's all the information there is.'

Ramos, 69, has been incarcerated at a prison at Dallas in northeastern Pennsylvania for molesting two other boys.

Investigators in Etan's case have long been focused on Ramos, who had been dating Etan's baby sitter at the time the boy disappeared.

Etan's disappearance prompted a massive search that stretched as far as Israel and spawned the national movement to publicize the cases of missing children.

The blond, blue-eyed boy's photo was among the first put on milk cartons, and his case turned May 25 into National Missing Children's Day.

His parents never moved or changed their phone number, in case he returned. In 2001, they obtained a court order officially declaring their son dead.

That same year, they brought a successful wrongful death suit against Ramos in 2001, but there 
wasn't enough evidence to make a criminal case.

Ramos was declared responsible for Etan's death in a civil court in 2004 but the Manhattan district attorney's office has said there wasn't enough evidence to charge him criminally.

Tipped: Police were lead to Hernandez after a resurgence in press on Etan's disappearance prompted an anonymous tip

Ramos has denied any involvement in Etan's disappearance.

He has declined interview requests while incarcerated, telling reporters 
he may make a public statement after his November 7 release.

In the 
early 1980s, Ramos was arrested but not convicted on charges he tried to
lure children to a drainage pipe he was living in.

At the time of his arrest, photos of young blond boys, similar to Etan, were found in his backpack.

After his release, Ramos traveled the country attending gatherings of the Rainbow
Family of Living Light, a loose collection of peace activists.

Then
in the mid-1980s he again faced child molestation charges when he was 
accused of luring three boys into his bus and assaulting them at two of 
the group's gatherings in Pennsylvania.

'He had 
thousands of dollars in 'Star Wars' toys on his bus. He had videotapes, 
and he had all kinds of materials he used to lure children inside,' 
Barry Adams, a longtime Rainbow member, recalled last month from his 
Montana home. 'It was a horrendous circumstance from A to Z.'

Convinced that Ramos is guilty of the crime, Etan's father Stan Patz sends him a copy of the missing child poster twice a year with the words 'What have you done with my little boy?' written on the back.

Earlier this year, a new suspect named Pedro Hernandez was charged with Etan's murder after police said he confessed this spring.

His lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, has said that Hernandez is mentally ill, and authorities have not cited any additional evidence to implicate him beyond his own admission.

Prosecutors are expected this month to announce whether they believe there's evidence enough to continue pursuing a case against Hernandez, who worked at a convenience store near Etan's home when the boy disappeared and told police he strangled the boy and stuffed his body in a trash bag.

Since his 
confession, an extensive probe has found no hard evidence that could 
link Hernandez to the crime and his attorney has raised even more doubts
about the case saying that his client suffers from schizophrenia, 
bipolar disorder, and has heard voices.

'He either did it, or he really believes he did it,' a source in the district attorney's office told the New York Post.
