Marouane Fellaini will not be punished for his elbow on Joe Allen, UEFA have confirmed.

The Manchester United midfielder left his Liverpool counterpart with a bloody nose during Belgium’s 0-0 draw with Wales on Sunday.

Referee Pavel Kralovec did not include the incident in his post-game report and in a reported statement released on Monday UEFA confirmed that ‘no disciplinary case (will be) opened’.

Fellaini was given a yellow card last season when he elbowed Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta

Fellaini is therefore free to play in Belgium’s next game against Cyprus in March.

Despite being left with a bloody nose, Allen insisted after the game that ‘there was nothing in it’.
