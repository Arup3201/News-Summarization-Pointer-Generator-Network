An Australian Insurance company has been accused of practicing 'predatory advertising' after they attempted to use the MH17 disaster to cash-in through their life insurance offers.

The Lisa Group, which deals with loans, insurance and superannuation and is based in Victoria, allegedly bought  the Google key words 'Malaysia Airlines' on the morning that news came in of the aviation tragedy.

The company then ran an advertisement for their life insurance offers that would appear at the top of search results when someone would Google the words.

The Lisa Group, a Victoria based insurance company, allegedly bought the Google key words 'Malaysia Airlines' on Friday morning before using the tragedy to advertise their life insurance offers

The words 'What a tragedy!' began the introduction to the 'special offer'.

'Up to 27 Australians were among 298 people on board a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet which was shot down over Ukraine with the loss of all on board,' the add read.

'Is it another sign to consider life insurance? #PrayForMH17.'

The company has since removed their advertisements but continues to receive wide criticism for the insensitive move.

When questioned about their marketing decision, the company's director, Warren Lazarus, told Mumbrella that their overseas partners were to blame for the poor decision.

The company received backlash from social media users for the insensitive advertising

The company has since removed their advertisements and apologized for the insensitive move, claiming it was their overseas partners were to blame

'We were made aware of the ads and immediately contacted our overseas partner and ordered it to be taken down,' Mr Lazarus said.

'I apologise for any distress this has caused, we have removed the add,' he added before allegedly hanging up.

When the Daily Mail Australia approached the Lisa Group they were also told by Mr Lazarus that the company wanted to appologise for any distress caused.

'We were absolutely flabbergasted when we saw the advertisements ourselves in the office,' he said.
