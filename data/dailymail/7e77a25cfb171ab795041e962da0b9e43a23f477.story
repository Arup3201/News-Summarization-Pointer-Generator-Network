The worker had been digging in a trench on the site when the roof caved in and buried him.

Leading fireman Lu Liang, 31, spent an hour tunnelling to the trapped worker.

A fire department spokesman said: 'They had to work fast because his air was running out.

'There was no time to shore up the area they dug. Their only thought was to save the life of the poor worker.'

An army of 200 firemen, police and auxiliary soldiers swooped on the site and began clawing at the earth with spades, picks and their bare hands
