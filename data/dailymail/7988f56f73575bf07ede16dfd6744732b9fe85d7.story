Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling may not have to pay a $320million tax bill if he is forced to sell the NBA team.

Mr Sterling has owned the Clippers since 1981, but has now been banned from the NBA for life after a recording of him ranting at his girlfriend for associating with black people came to light.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver is now seeking to force Mr Sterling to sell the team, which has been valued at up to $1billion.

A sale would then force the property tycoon to pay $323million in tax he would owe from a sale.

However, if Mr Sterling, the longest owner in the league, is forced to sell the Clippers, he could invoke Section 1033 of the U.S. tax code, which calls for special provision for anyone who has 'involuntarily converted' assets.

It is thought this is usually cited by people who lose property to natural disasters or under eminent domain.

The New York Post reported that to escape without a multi-million dollar tax bill, Mr Sterling would then have to re-invest the proceeds from the sale in a 'like-kind' venture, such as another sports team or entertainment venue, within two years.

Tax lawyer Bradley Marsh, chairman of taxation section of the California Bar told the newspaper: 'Because the NBA and Clippers saga has not yet played out, it is premature to decide whether this treatment would apply.

'I certainly wouldn't rule it out, though.'

It is not clear if he plans to sell the team, which would bring an end to his 33-year reign as owner.

The league is currently working with team management to appoint an interim chief executive officer to guide the franchise through what is expected to be a difficult transition for life after Mr Sterling. 

The move to ban the owner was announced just hours before the Clippers beat the Warriors in Game 7 of their playoff series on Saturday night at the Staples Center.

‘The best way to ensure the stability of the team during this difficult situation is to move quickly and install a CEO to oversee the Clippers organization,’ NBA executive vice president of communications Mike Bass said.

Those involved have already begun the search for the interim executive, he added.

Mr Sterling’s estranged wife and team co-owner Rochelle Sterling appeared to welcome the move, and pledged to work with whoever is involved.

‘I spoke with Commissioner Adam Silver this week to tell him that I fully supported his recent swift and decisive action.

‘We also agreed at that time that, as a next step, both the league and the team should work together to find some fresh, accomplished executive leadership for the Clippers,’ she continued.

‘I welcome his active involvement in the search for a person of the utmost character, proven excellence and a commitment to promoting equality and inclusiveness.’

Those rumoured to be interested in buying the Clippers include Oprah Winfrey, Magic Johnson and music industry executive David Geffen.

All references to Mr Sterling have already been taken from the team’s practice facility built only six years ago at a cost of $60million to their disgraced owner.

Even the ‘Sterling Drive’ sign at the front of the facility has been taken down.

The move to ban an owner is not unprecedented. Then-NBA 
commissioner David Stern appointed an interim CEO to run the New Orleans
 Hornets during the 2011-12 season after taking the team from former 
owner George Shinn.
