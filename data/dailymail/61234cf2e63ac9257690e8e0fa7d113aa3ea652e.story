From model-of-the-moment Cara 
Delevingne to the Duchess of Cambridge, there 
has never been a better time to be ditch the tweezers in favour of the heavy power brow.

And ever since 20-year-old Cara caught the world's attention walking in forty shows over London Fashion Week, there has been a boom in semi-permanent cosmetic eyebrow-thickening treatments.

One such clinic that offers the service to emulate Cara's big-brows look has been fully-booked for the past two months, with orders for the treatment up 200 per cent on the previous year.

And with Season 5 of Made In Chelsea 
hitting our screens next Monday, central character Binky Felstead has jumped on the power brow bandwagon in order to look her best for the show's big comeback.

The 22-year-old star has recently had the Power Brow treatment at Debra Robson LDN clinic in Harley Street  in order to get more definition and depth after seeing Cara at London Fashion Week.

Binky said: 'I love the look that Cara Delevingne has got and I’m really pleased that strong brows are back in again. I’m thrilled with the results of my Power Brow treatment.'

An over-arched, over plucked eyebrow not only dates your look - it ages you too.

That
is why, reports the clinic, the number of women 
seeking to enhance their brows has surged in recent months.

Binky added: 'The great strength of the Power Brow is that it looks totally natural even close up because the brows are built up using hundreds of individual hair strokes.

'In the past I have beefed up my eyebrows with an eye-pencil but this can be very time consuming on a daily basis and even then doesn’t always have the intensity or the staying power that I’m looking for.

'So I’ve enlisted the help of semi-permanent make-up artist Debra Robson.'

The procedure itself takes about 30 minutes, and Debra talked it through with Binky and precisely measured the shape and angle of her brows so that the finished result would be symmetrical and the perfect proportions for her face.

An anaesthetic cream had been applied to her brows before they started deciding the shape of them.

It took 15 minutes for the cream to take effect, and during that time Debra created a custom-blended pigment for the hair strokes which is a perfect match for your hair, eye and skin colour.

Speaking after the treatment, Binky said: 'I could barely feel a thing.

'It was amazing and I was really overjoyed with the results. You can see the improvement in the before and after pictures.

'In the 'before' the start of the brow near my nose is thin and it gets very messy and sparse at the peak and there are wispy bits at the tail of the brow, whereas my new Power Brow is stronger and frames the eye beautifully.'

The £760 treatment can last for several months.
