Having spent a lot of time with Carl Froch recently, it's been difficult to ignore his burning desire to box in Las Vegas. As we all know, anything can happen in boxing, but talks re-opened last week with the Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr camp and I am hopeful that a fight can be made in Las Vegas.

For Carl, it has always been his dream to fight in Vegas so it is something we will try hard to finalise.

It had seemingly died in the water, but I took a call from Top Rank on Saturday and they wanted to explore the possibilities further. I am now expecting to be on a conference call with Chavez’s representatives later this week where we will try to make more progress.

Carl Froch, 37, is close to sealing the dream Las Vegas fight with Mexican Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr

Should this fight go ahead, it will have a knock-on effect on James DeGale, who has earned the right to be mandatory challenger for Carl’s IBF super-middleweight world title.

There are time constraints regarding Carl having to face James and if it's not possible then you could see Carl vacating that belt to free himself up to fight Chavez. 

It would be tough for Carl to do that because he knows better than anyone the effort that goes into winning a belt. 

But a Vegas fight is the guy’s dream – he desperately wants to fight at the home of boxing and if he gets the chance he will take it.

If that happens, DeGale will fight for the vacant IBF belt in early 2015 with the winner likely to fight the winner of Froch and Chavez. 

That is a fight, assuming it is a unification between DeGale and Froch, which would fill Wembley next summer. Watch this space.

As ever in boxing, there are plenty of twists and turns so nothing is certain. But I am more hopeful than at any time before that we can make Froch-Chavez.

Anthony Joshua shocked even me at the weekend with the way he took out Denis Bakhtov inside two rounds. Everyone around us in the O2 was left open-mouthed at what they saw. I’m convinced that only David Haye of Britain’s stellar heavyweights would match him if they fought today, but more of that later.

One thing I think people saw on Saturday, as was mentioned in the recent Sportsmail interview with AJ, is that he properly enjoys beating up his opponent. He chases them down and just unleashes his strength on them. He is a brutal fighter.

What next? He will fight Michael Sprott in November – if Sprott doesn’t get cold feet - and I think a fight with Kevin Johnson, the American who took Vitali Klitschko 12 rounds, would be good for early 2015. Then bring on the Brits in a series of huge fights.

I would suggest he fight the loser of Dereck Chisora and Tyson Fury, then he can fight David Price in the summer. After that it would make sense to fight the winner of Chisora and Fury before a massive fight against Haye.

For me, Haye is obviously a standout above the other British heavyweights. I think Joshua would beat the rest today. 

As for Haye, that would be a tremendous milestone and a huge fight, maybe for the end of 2015, when Joshua will be at world level.

But no-one here is getting carried away. Joshua will earn those chances with hard work and more great performances. 

No-one is more level-headed or determined than him. He knows there is a path of great, high-interest fights out there for him. He needs to step up and do what he is doing and there will be more great nights.

Lee Selby also made a huge impact on our show at the O2 on Saturday. The Welsh Mayweather was given no more than a 50-50 chance against Joel Brunker, but barely lost a second of any round. He will fight IBF featherweight world champion Evgeny Gradovich before the end of March and who can see him losing? I can’t.

He had a lot to prove in that ring. He was following a stunning performance from domestic rival Josh Warrington the week before and responded in perfect fashion.

He is one of the most exciting talents coming through and has the good fortune of an excellent rival like Warrington. That is a fight a lot of people are asking me about and it is one I like a lot.

When Selby beats Gradovich – and I’m sure he will – I’d like to see him fight Warrington at Elland Road in summer 2015.

We have a wonderful show at Hull Ice Arena on October 25 and it is bringing Tommy Coyle and Luke Campbell closer together. Campbell, the Olympic champion, will fight Daniel Eduardo Brizuela and Coyle faces Michael Katsidis, one of the most exciting fighters of his time.

Considering the incredible intensity of Coyle’s win over Brizuela, I think his fight with Katsidis could be one of the fights of the year. An incredible fight. People say Katsidis is slowing down but he has been sparring in England for five weeks and word is he looks very sharp.

For Campbell, this is a tough, tough fight. Brizuela is a mile further along than his previous opponents and had a fight of the year contender with Coyle back in February.

In each case, I see this fight as a perfect marker before a possible fight between Coyle and Campbell at the KC Stadium in Hull next summer.

We had fun and games at a press conference in Dublin this week. We are taking a show there for the first time in years and cannot wait. 

Matthew Macklin will face Jorge Sebastian Heiland for the WBC international middleweight title in an official world title eliminator, while Anthony Fitzgerald will fight Spike O’Sullivan, Ian Tims takes on Michael Sweeney and Patrick Hyland is against John Simpson. It’ll be a great night in a city that deserves top-class boxing.
