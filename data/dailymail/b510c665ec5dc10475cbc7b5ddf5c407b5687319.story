The christening gown worn by gorgeous Prince George has certainly been given a run for its money.

A white cotton and lace heirloom from Cambridgeshire has been preserved almost immaculately for 116 years.

And this week four-month-old Theodore Thom became the tenth child to be christened in the hand-made gown, which has been passed through seven generations of his family and survived a flood in 2001.

Since it was sewn in 1897 by his great-great-great-great-grandmother, a seamstress who lived to 103, it has had just a few alterations.

The sleeves have been repaired and some lace flowers have been replaced - but otherwise it looks the same as in the age of Queen Victoria.

Theodore - whose full name is Theodore Robert Spzalek Thom - wore the gown on Sunday for his christening at St Andrew's Church in Girton, Cambridgeshire.

Theo’s grandmother Janet Thom, 63, 
who has kept the gown at her home in the village and wore it for her christening in 1950, said: 'The Royals seem to have got married at about the same time as my son and now they've got christened at the same time too - although it seems our gown has outlasted theirs a bit!

'I’m so glad the
whole family have worn it. It’s lovely. It’s a great thing to know the dress has been passed down from person to person.

'Family memories mean a lot and this is one of those things that our family can always remember.'

Several photos of family members wearing the gown were destroyed when Mrs Thom's home was flooded in 2001. But miraculously the gown, which was also at their home, survived.

'We had four inches of water coming in and all the photographs were in a plastic box under the stairs,' said Mrs Thom, a retired nursery teacher. 'I was devastated'.

Theodore's great-great-great-great-grandmother, known only as Grandma Boon, sewed the gown for the christening of her granddaughter May Spitty in 1897 in Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex.

May's brother, West Spitty, also wore it before handing it down to May's son Donald Mercier.

Donald ensured his daughter Janet - Theodore's grandmother - was christened in the gown, and handed it down to her when she grew up and moved to Cambridgeshire.

She then brought out the antique garment for the christening of her three children, Natalie, 40, Eloise, 36, and Robin, 30.

Finally, Natalie used the precious gown for her children Ruby May Kendrew, seven, and Charlotte Kendrew, five, before sustainable energy firm director Robin, who lives in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, dressed his son Theodore in it this week.

Theodore's grandmother added: 'Theo’s christening was a great day and I’m glad there were lots of people there to celebrate.

'I’ll keep patching up the dress for as long as I can.'

The ceremonial dress dates back to the Victorian era, in which ornate christening gowns were fashionable and prized by the families which owned them.

Soon afterwards the gown was used for the christening of Natalie's sister Eloise, in 1976

Since 1841, every Royal baby had been christened in a gown which was designed for Queen Victoria's first child.

But Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor was the last Royal baby to wear it in 2004, when a replica of the gown was sewn which has been used for every Royal christening since.

The replica was worn by Prince George, son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and third in line to the throne, at a private ceremony last week.

Theodore's gown was more than 100 years older than the one used to christen Prince George of Cambridge last week - although Prince George's gown was an exact replica of one fashioned in 1841
