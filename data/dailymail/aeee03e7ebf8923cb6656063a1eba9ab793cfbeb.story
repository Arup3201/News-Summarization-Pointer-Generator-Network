Psychiatrist Russ Scott and historian Ian MacFarlane discredited the romantic folklore surrounding the story of Ned Kelly  

A Queensland psychiatrist and a Victorian historian have teamed up to discredit the romantic legend of Ned Kelly and claim he was a psychopath.

Dr Russ Scott and Ian MacFarlane also argue that the Australian bushranger, who was hung in 1880 at 25 years of age, never uttered his famous last words 'such is life', in their article which was published in the Psychiatry, Psychology and Law journal.

Instead, Scott and MacFarlane discuss the idea that the folk hero was a 'pathological liar' and 'violent psychopath' who led a 'parasitic lifestyle'.

Their article, titled Ned Kelly - Stock Thief, Bank Robber, Murderer-Psychopath, analyses the mind and behaviour of the outlaw, beginning with his family life in Victoria.

It claims that the early death of Kelly's father 'compounded by the absence of opportunity and advancement, would have made it difficult for an even better man, with a stronger sense of self actualisation and internalised pro-social values, to have prevailed and prospered'.

'In the chaos of an adverse early development which was devoid of nurturing and which lacked the presence of strong, responsible male role models, Kelly modelled the social delinquency and disrespect for order and authority of his extended family and their anti-social associates.

'The crushing poverty, disadvantage and insecurity that his family experienced as poor Irish-Australian selectors, can be speculated to have imbued the young Kelly with an angry, defiant disposition and an aggrieved perspective on society and its norms and rules.'

The article summarises that Kelly had no empathy for others, such as his victims and their families and that that he 'practised at repeatedly claiming to have been wronged'

Detailing his early crimes, from stealing a calf at 10-years-old to his escalation into a full-blown outlaw when he was responsible for killing three policemen 1878, the article summarises that Kelly had no empathy for others including his victims and their families. 

Instead, Scott and MacFarlane claim that Kelly was parasitic in that he 'practised at repeatedly claiming to have been wronged' and thus shifting blame elsewhere. 

They argue that this is evident in the way that he defended killing the three officers as an action of self-defence.

This, in addition to arguments that he often lied and fabricated incidents and the lack of evidence that he had many friendships or intimate relationships, lead the authors to conclude that Kelly was undoubtedly a psychopath who was feared rather than loved in his community.

Scott and MacFarlane wrote in their journal article, that Kelly's famous last words 'such is life', were likely to be a myth as the noise from the Catholic chaplain and footsteps on the metal floor would have meant his words were inaudible to those watching from the floor below

However, perhaps their most devastating claim is that the bushranger never uttered his famous last words 'such is life', or the alternative, 'ah well, I suppose it has come to this'.

Scott and MacFarlane write: 'The footsteps and shuffling on the metal floor and the murmured prayers of Dean O'Hare, the Catholic chaplain who accompanied Kelly as he was prepared for execution, would have ensured that nothing of what Kelly may have said would have been audible to those watching from the floor below in the cavernous prison hall. 

'The accounts published … are apocryphal.'
