Alaska may be better known for its glaciers and forests than for its beaches, but this week residents of the icy state have been soaking up the sun during a freak heatwave.

Anchorage, the state's biggest city, has seen record temperatures of 81F (27C), while other parts of Alaska are believed to have climbed as high as 98F.

However, while many are delighted by the unusual warmth, others are sweltering in homes and offices which lack air-conditioning and are not designed to tackle heat.

Crowds: Residents of the state have seized the rare opportunity to indulge in summery activities

Residents have been sunbathing and swimming at lakes throughout the state, welcoming the heatwave which comes just a month after the last snows of the winter.

18-year-old Jordan Rollison, who joined hundreds relaxing on the shore of Goose Lake, commented: 'I love it - I've never seen a summer like this, ever.'

But others were less positive - Anchorage resident Lorraine Roehl said, 'It's almost unbearable to me. I don't like being hot.'

State officials took the unusual step of warning people that they should wear sunscreen if they go outside.

The 81F temperature officially recorded in Anchorage yesterday is the highest ever seen on that date, while other places saw even more extreme spikes.

The small town of Talkeetna near Mt McKinley saw an official peak of 96F, and a lodge nearby apparently measured 98F - equalling the highest temperature ever recorded in Alaska.

'This is the hottest heat wave in Alaska since 1969,' said meteorolist Jeff Masters. 'You're way, way from normal.'

The heat wave also comes after a few cooler summers - the last time it officially hit the 80 mark in Anchorage was 2009.

Bonanza: Tim Craig with the last fan available for sale at the True Value Hardware store in Anchorage

The wave has brought a bonanza for stores selling summer supplies - the True Value Hardware store had run out of fans, and was selling five times the usual amount of mosquito repellent.

'Those are two hot items, so to speak,' store owner Tim Craig joked.

However, the unusual heat is set to come to an end soon - a high pressure system responsible for clear skies and high temperatures has moved on, meaning forecasters expect a cooling trend starting from today.
