A former actress claims she didn't know her husband murdered the 27-year-old mother of his two young children until he pushed her to help hide the body parts more than a week later.

Amanda Hayes, 41, took the stand in her defense, saying she only agreed to help hide the chopped up body parts of Laura Ackerson when her husband Grant threatened to kill her as well.

But prosecutors said Hayes never tried to expose her husband's heinous act, and even seemed happy in pictures taken after they disposed of the body .

More than that, they say the couple planned the murder after a troubled custody battle over Grant's two young sons with Ackerson.

Murderer? Prosecutors say former-actress Amanda Hayes, 41, helped her husband murder the mother of his two children in the midst of a bitter custody battle

Gruesome: Pieces of Laura Ackerson's body were found in a Texas creek 11 days after she was murdered at the Raleigh apartment of Grant and Amanda Hayes

Hayes is facing charges of first-degree murder and accessory after the fact for the July 2011 death. Her husband Grant was convicted last year of murder and is currently serving a life sentence.

After closing statements Monday, a North Carolina jury began deliberations. They will meet again to discuss the case Tuesday morning.

Hayes' defense attorney asked the jury to acquit his client on both charges, saying her 'classic sociopath' husband acted alone in the murder and Hayes was forced to help hide the body parts when threatened the lives of her and the children.

When Hayes took the stand, she described the night of Ackerson's death.

According to Hayes, Ackerson had come over to their apartment and Grant grabbed Ackerson, causing the 27-year-old to fall and hit her head.

That's when Hayes grabbed the children and left the apartment so that Grant could call an ambulance.

Unbeknownst to Hayes, by the time she got back Grant had strangled Ackerson to death with an apple adapter chord. At some point he smuggled her body out of the house wrapped in a carpet to chop up the body and store the pieces in coolers.

It wasn't until six days later, on July 18, that Hayes had realized what her husband had done.

The couple and the children had taken a trip to visit Hayes' sister in Richmond, Texas and drop off some furniture.

'He's concealed everything he's done from Amanda,' her attorney said. 'She arrives in Texas, happy, content to see her sister without any hint whatsoever that Grant has killed Laura.'

Grant stored the coolers with Ackerson's body parts in them behind some of the furniture they shuttled in a rented U-haul van.

She only agreed to help hide the body when her husband threatened her life, as well as the lives of their children.

Hayes says her husband told her 'none of us were going to make it back to North Carolina' if she didn't help get rid of the body.

Pieces of Ackerson's body were found 11 days after the slaying in a creek near Hayes' sister's house.

But prosecutors say Hayes' story 'is so ridiculous' and makes 'zero sense'.

Ruined plans: Prosecutors also say that the Hayes became annoyed at the prospect of having to split custody with Ackerson, which would mean they couldn't relocate to the Virgin Islands for Grant's music career

They say there is a clear motive behind the murder, since the couple had become frustrated during the custody battle over Grant's 2- and 3-year-old sons with Ackerson.

A court-appointed attorney was about to recommend split custody, and the Hayes didn't want to be ferrying the kids back and forth.

Plus, the decision would mean the family wouldn't be able to relocate to the Virgin Islands for Grant's music career.

'Amanda Hayes and Grant Hayes decided that they were going to kill Laura and erase her, that she was going to stop being the barrier and anchor that kept them here and kept them going forward,' Assistant District Attorney Becky Holt said.

Even if she wasn't directly involved in Ackerson's murder, prosecutors say she definitely acted as an accessory and didn't make any attempts to bring her husband to justice for his crime.

While Hayes claims she was afraid for her life and under duress after hiding Ackerson's body, prosecutors point out that she didn't make any attempt to flee from the situation.

When she met with police alone two days before her arrest, she wouldn't give them any information on the murder.

'She had multiple, multiple opportunities to go and flee a situation that she claimed was marked with duress,' Holt said.

And then there are the pictures of Hayes, her husband and the kids on their way back from Texas. In the pictures, Hayes appears happy and beaming next to her family - not the markings of a woman under duress, prosecutors said.

'What you've experienced is a fine acting job. Amanda Hayes has come before you and has tried to sell you on a role,' Holt told jurors. 'She was not afraid of Grant Hayes then. She was not afraid a year later. She's given the performance of her life.'

Jurors will first have to decide whether Hayes is guilty or not guilty of murder. If they decide she is not guilty they will then have to decide whether she is guilty of accessory to murder. She can't be convicted of both.Â
