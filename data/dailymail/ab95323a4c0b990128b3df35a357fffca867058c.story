Campaign: Paul Lamb and Jane Nicklinson, both 58, at the Supreme Court in Central London yesterday

The severely disabled are treated worse than pets under existing laws, a right-to-die campaigner said yesterday.

Paul Lamb, who is paralysed from the neck down following a car crash, said very sick or badly injured animals are put down as an act of kindness.

He wants a change in the law to allow doctors and healthcare professionals to assist severely disabled people to commit suicide.

Arriving at the Supreme Court for the latest stage in his legal battle, Mr Lamb, 58, said: ‘You would not do this [prevent assisted death] with pets. Pets have got the law in their favour.’

He was joined by Jane Nicklinson, who is bringing the case on behalf of her late husband Tony. Mr Nicklinson, who was paralysed from the neck down, fought for his right to an assisted death until he passed away last year.

Mrs Nicklinson, 58, of Melksham, Wiltshire, said it was ‘uncivilised’ that people such as her husband had to suffer instead of being allowed to die with the help of a doctor.

A change in the law, if it happened, would apply only to the severely disabled, she added.

‘I saw the way that Tony suffered and I don’t want other people to suffer like him,’ she said. ‘We feel very strongly… something needs to be done.’

Nine Supreme Court judges yesterday heard the arguments, which revolve around whether the law on assisted suicide is incompatible with Article 8 of the Human Rights Act –  the right to a family life.

Paul Bowen QC, for Mrs Nicklinson and Mr Lamb, said that the law was an ‘insurmountable obstacle’ for severely disabled people who need assistance to end their lives.

Mrs Nicklinson, Mr Lamb and another man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, brought the case to Britain’s highest court after it was rejected by the High Court and the Court of Appeal. 

A ruling is expected next year. Father-of-two Mr Nicklinson was left paralysed by a stroke in 2005 but remained mentally sound.

He died from pneumonia aged 58 in August last year, a week after learning he had lost his case at the Court of Appeal. He had refused food and fluids following the ruling.

Mr Lamb, from Bramley, Leeds, has been paralysed except for limited movement in his right hand and in significant pain since his road accident in 1990.

‘A change in the law would mean more to me than a million dollars,’ he said outside court. ‘A change in the law would be a massive step in the right direction.’

The Court of Appeal ruled it was up to Parliament to change the law on assisted suicide as it was an issue of conscience, not of legal principle.

'A change in the law would mean more to me than a million dollars. A change in the law would be a massive step in the right direction'

Paul Lamb

The then Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, sitting with Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson and Lord Justice Elias, said Parliament ‘represents the conscience of the nation’ in life and death issues, adding: ‘Judges, however eminent, do not; our responsibility is to discover the relevant legal principles, and apply the law as we find it.’

On Sunday, one of the country’s most distinguished judges warned of the perils of legalising assisted suicide, arguing that it would cross ‘a line in the sand’ towards euthanasia.

Baroness Butler-Sloss said: ‘The law rests on the principle that we do not involved ourselves in deliberately bringing about the deaths of others.

‘Once we start making exceptions based on arbitrary criteria like terminal illness, that frontier becomes just a line in the sand, easily crossed and hard to defend.’
