Asking prices for houses in London have soared by 10 per cent in a month, according to a leading property website.

They rose by more than £50,000, fuelling fears that the capital’s property market is overheating.

The average price being asked by sellers increased from £493,748 to £544,232 between September and October, said Rightmove.

The website put much of the increase down to a ‘frenzy’ of activity in parts of prime central London as wealthy overseas investors look for a safe haven to place their cash amid the troubles of the eurozone.

Rightmove director Miles Shipside said that while this is happening and developers can achieve sales at premium prices, this ‘eats up a much-needed source of fresh supply and drags up existing property prices at an even faster rate’.

He added: ‘Although it is not sustainable in the longer term, some agents currently report there is a buying frenzy in parts of prime inner London, with available stock so low that their shelves are now bare.’

The new high of £544,232 is £28,852 more than the previous high, which was recorded in July – asking prices fell during the traditional summer slowdown.

Across England and Wales, asking prices rose more gently by 2.8 per cent month-on-month, following two months of falls, to reach £252,418 on average.

Prices across the country are 3.8 per cent higher than they were a year ago, although in London they have shot up by 13.8 per cent over this period

The City of Westminster was named by Rightmove as London’s strongest-performing house price area in October.

Prices there have soared by 11.9 per cent month-on-month to reach £1.6million typically. Kensington and Chelsea and Hammersmith and Fulham also recorded increases of 11.8 per cent in sellers’ asking prices over the month.

Sellers are now typically asking £2.4million for a home in Kensington and Chelsea and £1.1million for a home in Hammersmith and Fulham.

Despite the overall upward march in prices, Rightmove said that ‘a bubble seems a long way off in the majority of regions’.

Four areas recorded year-on-year falls in house values: Wales, the North, the North-West and the West Midlands.

The North recorded the biggest 
year-on-year drop, with asking prices falling by 2.2 per cent to reach 
£145,094 on average. Sellers in Wales have dropped their asking prices 
by the second biggest amount over the last year, with prices falling by 
1.4 per cent annually to typically reach £165,708.

After
London, the East Midlands saw the second biggest annual increase in 
asking prices, with a 6.0 per cent annual uplift taking them to £171,913
on average.

Capital trends: Some estate agents currently report there is a buying frenzy in parts of prime inner London, with available stock so low that their shelves are now bare

The findings come after the Council of Mortgage Lenders reported last week that lending activity is at its strongest in five years and the Office for National Statistics said that UK house prices reached an all-time high of £247,000 in August, surpassing a previous 2008 peak.

Housing market activity among people with low deposits who have previously struggled to get on the property ladder is expected to increase further in the coming months, as a new phase of the Government’s flagship Help to Buy scheme is fully fired into action.

Royal Bank of Scotland, NatWest, Halifax and Bank of Scotland started offering state-backed loans to people with deposits as low as 5 per cent under the scheme this month and the lenders have reported strong interest so far.
