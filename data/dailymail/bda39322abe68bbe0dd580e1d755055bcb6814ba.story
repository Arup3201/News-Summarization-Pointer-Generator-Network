The heartbroken mother of an Iraq veteran shot dead as he tried to buy her an iPad for Christmas today spoke for the first time, saying: ‘He was incredibly generous. He loved his family and he loved life’. 

New dad Jim Vester, 32, was lured to an Indianapolis parking lot on Wednesday by two men who posted an advert on Craigslist, saying they had an iPad for sale.

But when he arrived he was ambushed, gunned down and robbed. Brothers Tyron Kincade, 19, and Tyshaune Kincade, 18, were today charged with his murder.

Grief: Jim Vester was killed while trying to buy an iPad for his parents, Janice and Walter. Mrs Vester told MailOnline: I don¿t want to speak about those people, I just want to talk about Jim and his life

Wonderful: Mrs Vester said: 'He loved life, he loved his family, he loved his son and he loved his wife'

It has since been revealed that the men are suspects in four other similar robberies, where they lured victims with Craigslist posts and then took their valuables at gun point.

Indiana National Guardsman and Iraq war veteran, Mr Vester, 32, leaves behind wife Jamie and one-year-old son Gavin.

And his devastated mother Janice today spoke to MailOnline to pay tribute to her beloved son. Mr Vester was trying to buy his mother and father Walter the iPad for Christmas when he was shot.

Speaking through floods of tears, Mrs Vester said: ‘He was a wonderful father and a wonderful son. It was his funeral yesterday and about 1,000 people came to the calling and said wonderful things about him.

‘He loved to entertain and to help his family out. He would do anything for us. He was incredibly generous.

‘The detective on the case has kept us well informed, but I don’t want to speak about those people, I just want to talk about Jim and his life.

‘I want to speak about what a great guy he was. He loved life, he loved his family, he loved his son and he loved his wife.

‘All the military people we have spoken to have told us that he was the one who kept them in line, that they could count on Jim for everything.

‘He hadn’t always wanted to be a soldier, but the military was very good for him, it was perfect for him. He loved the military and he was very proud to serve. They have been very, very supportive since Jim’s death.’

Talking about her son’s young family, she added: ‘We have spent the whole time with Jamie and Gavin. She is hanging in there as best she can.’

Jamie has also released an emotional statement praising her late husband. She said: ‘Jim was a funny, caring man who loved to be around people. He always had a smile on his face and impacted the lives of so many.

‘His boisterous laugh and rosy red cheeks will always be remembered by everyone. He was a very loving father to Gavin, and the best husband I could have asked for. Jim was very proud to be a soldier in the Indiana National Guard and volunteered his time in the Ceremonial Unit on the firing team.

Devastated: Wife, Jamie, (pictured with Jim and son Gavin), said: 'I am so happy his story has (gone) viral so maybe people will think twice about trying to run a scam/robbery/murder through Craigslist or any other site'

Love: Jamie added: 'God has given me more strength in this situation than I ever thought was possible. This past Friday a rainbow was in the sky and I know it was Jim saying he was at peace'

‘I am so happy his story has (gone) viral worldwide so maybe people will think twice about trying to run a scam/robbery/murder through Craigslist or any other site. I want to focus on all of the good Jim brought to this world and not focus on the people who did this to him.

‘I have lent upon this Bible verse many times throughout this tragedy, ‘You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.’ Genesis 50:20 (NIV).

‘God has given me more strength in this situation than I ever thought was possible. This past Friday a rainbow was in the sky and I know it was Jim saying he was at peace.

‘Jim was awarded two medals yesterday from General Umbarger that I proudly wore all day. Jim was my hero is so many ways. Thank you everyone for your condolences. RIP Jim Vester, wonderful husband, father, son, brother, friend, soldier.’

Previous: It has been revealed that at least four other robberies were carried out in the area, where the victims have been led into a trap by a fake Craigslist posting, before being robbed. Tyshaune Kincade’s cell number allegedly links to all four crimes and police are now looking to file further charges against the brothers

Since the terrible tragedy on Wednesday, details of the case have started to emerge. A police report states Mr Vester arranged to meet someone who had advertised an iPad for sale on Craigslist at around 3.30pm in a car lot outside an apartment complex on Wyckford Drive, Indianapolis.

After exchanging texts with the seller, he was confronted by two men in their teens or early 20s.

Witnesses say they overheard Mr Vester introduce himself as ‘Jim’ and moments later another man said, ‘This is a robbery’. The second attacker was then heard, saying, ‘God damn’. Soon after there were two gunshots.

The two men were seen running away from the scene by another set of witnesses and Mr Vester staggered back to his car, before collapsing. He had been shot in the chest.

Police spoke to a friend of Mr Vester soon after his murder and he said the soldier was fully aware the area he was going to could be dangerous and had actually asked others to go with him.

Tragically no one was able to make the trip.

The Kincade brothers were arrested in connection with the murder and robbery on Friday. They appeared in court on Tuesday and an automatic not guilty plea was entered on their behalf.

Police have revealed that investigators recovered a cell phone matching the number Vester contacted when answering the Craigslist ad.

The phone was inside a vehicle Tyshaune Kincade was driving when he was stopped by police. That same number was also stored inside Kincade’s mother’s cell phone with a photo of her son assigned to the contact.

During their search of the Kincade’s home, the teens’ mother also showed detectives where she kept her handgun. She said it was missing and the only people able to access it were her sons.

It has also come to light that there have been at least four other robberies in the area, where the victims have been led into a trap by a fake Craigslist posting, before being robbed of cash and mobile phones at gun point.

Tyshaune Kincade’s cell number apparently links to all four crimes and police are now looking to file further charges against the brothers.

Since Mr Vester’s death an online campaign to help his family has raised more than $80,000. To donate to the family's youcaring campaign, click here.
