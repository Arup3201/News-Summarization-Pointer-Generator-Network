The BBC spends more than £20,000 a year on buying TV licences for its offices, MailOnline can reveal.

The Corporation pays the money to outsourcing giant Capita, which then gives it back to the BBC to fund its programming.

Campaigners described the situation as 'ridiculous', and called on the BBC to stop wasting resources by needlessly paying thousands of pounds to itself.

Payments: The BBC spends more than £20,000 a year on the licence fee so employees can watch TV at work

Despite being the sole beneficiary of the licence fee, the BBC is still liable to pay the charge for all of its offices and studios which have televisions installed.

The Corporation spent a total of £20,224.50 on the licence fee in the financial year 2012-13, according to data obtained through a Freedom of Information request.

That figure does not include the BBC's commercial properties such as BBC Worldwide and UKTV.

In addition, the Corporation admitted that separate departments may hold additional TV licences, but claimed that it would take too much work to find out how much they spent.

A spokesman for the BBC told MailOnline: 'The BBC, in common with other large businesses, holds licences designed specifically for organisations with multiple sites and it pays the full licence fee for each of its sites.'

Charge: The licence fee is collected by outsourcing firm Capita before being paid to the Corporation

The bill of £20,224.50 covers the cost of 139 individual licences, at a price of £145.50 each.

Dia Chakravarty of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'This ridiculous situation means that licence fee payers are paying the BBC to pay the licence fee for their employees.

'It's yet another example of public sector inefficiency which leads to higher bills for hard-pressed taxpayers picking up the tab. The BBC should look into it urgently and end this practice.'

Large organisations like the BBC are eligible to buy a 'company group TV licence', allowing them to pay for multiple premises under a single licence.

The Corporation does not get a discount on the licence fee - the only purpose of which is to fund BBC television, radio and online services.

Critics: BBC stars such as John Humphrys and Jeremy Paxman have spoken out against bureaucracy

The
 television licence fee is at the centre of political debate about the 
future of the BBC ahead of the expiry of the Corporation's current Royal
 Charter in 2016.

Some campaigners argue that it is unfair to levy a fee on all TV viewers which goes solely to one broadcaster.

This
 week, MPs voted to end the threat of jail for people who do not pay the
 licence fee, meaning that in future fee-dodgers will only be subject to
 a fine.

Dozens of people are imprisoned every year for refusing to pay fines imposed by courts after they fail to buy a TV licence.

When
 the BBC's Royal Charter is renegotiated in two years' time, it could face 
calls to share licence fee revenue with other broadcasters such as 
Channel 4 or local news outlets.

The cost of the licence fee has been frozen at £145.50 since 2011, with the BBC collecting a total of £3.7billion in 2012-13.

The BBC is responsible for collecting 
and administering the licence fee, but the job is contracted out to 
Capita, Britain's largest outsourcing firm.

Capita is paid up to £100million for 
collecting payments from television viewers, and has been accused of 
overly aggressive techniques, including sending threatening letters to 
households even if they do not actually possess a TV.

According to the BBC, the cost of collecting the fee amounts to 3.4 per cent of the total revenue paid in by viewers.

The disclosure that the BBC spends thousands of pounds paying the licence fee, before being given the money back again, is likely to fuel the debate over the level of bureaucracy at the Corporation.

Leading presenters such as Jeremy Paxman and John Humphrys have publicly lambasted the 'box-ticking' culture of the BBC, which has 23,000 employees and an annual budget of more than £5billion.

Mr Humphrys suggested earlier this year that the Corporation should shrink by a third, adding: 'We could cut out layers of bureaucracy and still produce the news.'

Mr Paxman, the host of Newsnight, was equally scathing when he gave evidence to an internal inquiry last year, saying of one department: 'I don't know what they do. I mean, they talk to each other, I suppose, as all these bloody people do.'
