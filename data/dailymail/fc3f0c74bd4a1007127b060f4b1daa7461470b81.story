Sergio Aguero hopes there are plenty more goals to come after smashing four past Tottenham to become Manchester City's record Premier League scorer.

The Argentina striker scored all City's goals as they overpowered 10-man Spurs 4-1 in an enthralling clash at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.

Aguero's haul took him to 61 in the competition, three past compatriot Carlos Tevez's mark of 58 for the club, to 85 in 132 City appearances overall.

Sergio Aguero's four-goal haul against Tottenham makes him Manchester City's all-time top Premier League scorer. 

Sergio Aguero - 61 goals (95 games)

Carlos Tevez - 58 goals (113 games)

Edin Dzeko - 48 goals (115 games)

Yaya Toure - 42 goals (141 games)

Nicolas Anelka - 37 goals (89 games) 

It was a devastating reminder of his talents now that the fitness concerns that have hampered him throughout 2014 finally seem behind him.

'I am very happy to be part of the history of this club and I hope I can continue scoring goals,' said Aguero, whose City strikes include the memorable injury-time effort that clinched the title in 2012.

'But the most important thing is City can win games with my goals.

'I was very happy with my performance but the most important thing is we got the three points.'

Aguero's performance could hardly have come as a surprise to his countryman Mauricio Pochettino, the Spurs manager.

Prior to the game Pochettino had equated Aguero's play to the musical genius of Mozart, and his subsequent display reignited debate over where the forward ranks among the world's elite.

Comparisons with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo were commonplace a year ago before a sequence of muscle injuries ravaged the second part of his 2013-14 campaign and his World Cup.

Aguero opened the scoring against Spurs with a precise finish after 13 minutes and then restored the lead from the spot seven minutes later after Christian Eriksen hit a quickfire equaliser.

He then had another penalty saved by Hugo Lloris but he completed his hat-trick with a third spot-kick after another Argentine, Federico Fazio, had been sent off for pulling him back. It also came soon after City goalkeeper Joe Hart had remarkably kept out a Roberto Soldado penalty at the other end.

Another crisp Aguero strike completed the scoring 15 minutes from time.

James Milner hit the post late on and in the final analysis City, and particularly Aguero, could have scored several more, such was the threat they posed.

But Spurs were also dangerous and before Aguero's 68th-minute third goal the contest was very open. Hart came to the champions' rescue on a number of occasions.

Hart said: 'It was an exciting game - two exciting teams and luckily we got the better in the attacking stakes.

'They played well, they attacked well, they are quite similar to us in their style of play.

'But Kun (Aguero) was amazing with the goals he scored and could have got more.'

Spurs forward Ryan Mason felt the final outcome did not do the visitors' efforts justice.

Like City, Pochettino's side were more comfortable in attack than defence and had they taken more chances the result could have been very different.

Mason himself was twice denied by brilliant saves from Hart in the first half.

The 23-year-old, who also had a hand in his side's goal, told Spurs TV: 'The lads are devastated because we came here to win the game and I think we had a good chance.

'The penalty miss was massive and then obviously the sending-off killed our momentum. It was a 4-1 scoreline but I don't think the game reflected that.

'I think we created quite a few chances. The gaffer wanted us to press high up the pitch and when we got it right we countered, and our first goal came from that.'

On a personal level, Mason was pleased with his own performance. Mason, who has had loan spells with Yeovil, Doncaster, Millwall and French club Lorient, has been given a chance by Pochettino and seems determined to take it.

He said: 'On a positive note I felt I did all right, but we have lost the game, so it is a bit bitter-sweet. I am a bit gutted about that.

'But we have got a massive game Thursday and we have got a game at the Lane next week against Newcastle and hopefully we can put things right there.'

Spurs host Greek side Asteras in the Europa League this week while City head to Russia for a Champions League clash against CSKA Moscow.
