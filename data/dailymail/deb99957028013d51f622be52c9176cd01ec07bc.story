A care home has been fined £85,000 after a dementia sufferer was crushed to death by a wardrobe that wasn't fitted properly to her bedroom wall. 

Claire Hughes, 64, who suffered from dementia, was 'obsessed' with dressing up in her old clothes, and would put on layer upon layer if left by herself at the Chase Care Centre in Watford, Hertfordshire.

St Albans Crown Court heard how she was found dead underneath her wardrobe after pulling it free from - sending it toppling onto her in December 2011.

Dementia-sufferer Claire Hughes, 64, was found dead at Chase Care Centre in Watford, Hertfordshire, after her wardrobe fell on top of her 

The court heard on Thursday how the wardrobe had not been fixed to the wall properly and had only been screwed into chipboard on the wall.

Mrs Hughes had been trying to get to her clothes, pulling at the locked wardrobe until it fell on top of her, crushing her to death.

The court heard how Mrs Hughes was diagnosed with dementia in 2007 and would only let her husband, a retired company director, feed her.

Sandra Dias, an inspector for the Health and Safety Executive - which brought the prosecution - said the care home was aware of Mrs Hughes' obsession with her clothing and should have taken steps to secure the wardrobe.

She said: 'Mrs Hughes' death was a wholly preventable tragedy caused by unacceptable management failings on the part of Life Style Care PLC. They put her at unnecessary risk.

'The company was aware of her obsession with clothing and that is why they locked her wardrobe.

'In doing so it was eminently foreseeable that she would attempt to open it using force, and that the wardrobe therefore needed to be rigid and secure.

'Working in a care home is a specialised job, which involves dealing with vulnerable people.

'Care homes must ensure that they have the correct training in place for all their employees, and that they work to adequately assess and eliminate all significant risks.'

St Albans Crown Court heard the wardrobe was full of old clothes she was 'obsessed' with and had not been fitted to the wall properly 

Dominic Kay, defending, said: 'It is a very, very sad case. Mrs Hughes was well-liked by the staff. The company expresses its regret and remorse to her family.

'It was not foreseen that she would use the force she did on the wardrobe. It is not a case of corner cutting. It was an oversight.'

The company which runs the care home LifeStyle Care - which has 37 care homes around the UK - admitted failing to discharge its duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.

It said it had now ensured the wardrobes in all of its care homes were now secured with longer screws fixed to timber batons and fixed to a concrete wall.

Judge John Plumstead said: 'This unfortunate lady was intent on gaining access to her clothing.

'Steps should have been taken to ensure the wardrobe was fixed. The attempt to fix the wardrobe was botched. The wardrobe was very poorly secured indeed. The company failed in their duty to keep this lady safe.'

The firm was fined £85,000 and ordered to pay £48,000 in court costs.
