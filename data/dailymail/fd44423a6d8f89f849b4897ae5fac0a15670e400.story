Twice the legal limit: Mitchell Todd was not wearing a seatbelt and surrounded by empty wine bottles and beer cans when he crashed his car

An international rugby player, twice the legal drinking limit, was not wearing a seatbelt when he crashed and died following a drinking session at his rugby club, an inquest heard today.

Former Scotland under-20 international and Nottingham Rugby Club player Mitchell Todd, 21, was found in his Citroen C3, surrounded by empty wine bottles and beer cans, in a field near Normanton-on-the-Wolds in south Nottinghamshire last August by a member of the public.

A post-mortem examination confirmed Todd, who represented Scotland under 20s in last season's Six Nations and featured in the Junior World Cup, died as a result of a catastrophic brain injury which he could not have survived, the inquest at Nottingham Town Hall heard today.

Todd had drunk excessively after an all-day training event with Nottingham Rugby Club at Trent College in Long Eaton, Nottinghamshire, on August 14 last year before being found in his car in the early hours of the following morning, assistant deputy coroner Jane Gillespie heard.

His blood-alcohol reading was 172mg of 
alcohol per 100mls of blood an inquest into his death heard today. The 
legal driving limit is 80mg.

Detective constable Mark Henshaw, from Nottinghamshire Police, told the inquest the young player, who was described by his club as an ‘exceptional talent’, drank free wine and beer at a meal at the end of the training event at the college.

He then got a taxi into Nottingham city centre where he continued to drink beer and spirits with his team mates until 2am.

The rugby club had warned players not to drive after the event at the college but an intoxicated Todd ignored this advice and returned to his car.

The officer told the inquest it was not known why Todd, who lived in Nod Rise, Coventry, had been driving on Cotgrave Road as he knew no one in that area.

Residents in the area described hearing a loud thud around 3.15am on August 15 and seeing a small, dark coloured vehicle travelling at speed to the police.

Todd's mother Delia Todd wiped tears from her eyes as Pc Robert Lloyd, a forensics collision investigator with Nottinghamshire Police, described the moments before the crash that claimed her son's life.

The officer told the hearing the 
Citroen had been travelling in excess of the 40mph speed limit when Todd
 lost control of his vehicle on a left hand bend.

He then drove on the wrong side of 
the road, clipping road signs and trees as he careered across grass 
verges and kerbs before failing to take a right hand bend and crashing 
through a fence and hedge into a field, Pc Lloyd told the inquest.

An inquest was opened and adjourned 
for further investigation by police last summer after the car was found 
lying on its roof in the field, pointing towards the road.

Pc Lloyd told the hearing the car was found to have no defects but that Todd had not been wearing his seat belt.

The officer said: ‘If he had been 
wearing his seat belt I think there would have been a very great 
difference to the outcome. He would have been shaken up but not have 
sustained the serious injuries which he did.’

He confirmed no other vehicles had been involved in the incident and that Todd had been travelling alone in the car.

Pc Lloyd said: ‘In my opinion the 
cause of the crash was travelling too fast around a left hand bend while
 the driver was intoxicated. The state of his injuries were compounded 
by the lack of a seat belt.’

Summing up the evidence, Miss 
Gillespie described Todd, who was born in Solihull and had just finished
 a degree in sports therapy at Coventry University, as a rugby player 
with a promising career in front of him.

Recording a verdict of accidental 
death, the coroner said: ‘This is a sad, unnecessary and preventable 
waste of a talented young life and I very much hope that valuable 
lessons are learnt as a result of this tragedy.

‘I find that the combination of 
intoxication, excess speed and Mitchell's failure to wear a seatbelt 
resulted in this terrible incident and the catastrophic brain injury 
suffered by Mitchell, which he simply could not survive.

‘Taking into account all of the evidence available to me, my verdict is one of accidental death.

‘I extend my deepest sympathies to Mitchell's family and friends.’

Ms Todd made no comment following the verdict.

Nottingham Rugby chief executive 
Simon Beatham said: ‘Everyone at Nottingham Rugby continues to mourn the
 death of an exceptionally talented young man.

‘The loss of Mitchell touched this club profoundly and our hearts, thoughts and sympathies are with all his family and friends.’

Todd signed a new contract with the 
club in May and was expected to make a big impact during the 2012-2013 
season, the club added.

He qualified for Scotland through his
 Edinburgh-born father and had also represented Scottish Exiles from 
under-17 to under-20 level. He won 10 Scotland under-20 caps and played 
in the IRB Junior World Championship.

Rob Brierley, the Scottish Rugby 
Union's performance development manager for Exiles, said: ‘Mitch was a 
quiet, sensitive bloke with a real steely determination never more 
evident than on the rugby pitch.

‘He was a real athlete, somebody who was late to the game and was developing all the time.’

The Scottish Rugby Union added: ‘Scottish Rugby extends its sincere condolences to all Mitchell Todd's family and friends.’
