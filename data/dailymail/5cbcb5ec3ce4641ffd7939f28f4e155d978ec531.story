Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton faced a furious backlash last night as he was crowned BBC Sports Personality of the year.

Hamilton became the seventh formula 1 driver to scoop the award beating golfer Rory McIlroy to the post by more than 85,000 votes.

But within minutes of receiving the award amid a standing ovation from guests at the event in Glasgow, the racing driver was being attacked on social media for his status as a tax exile.

Furious twitter users took the site to vent their fury that someone who ‘doesn’t even have TV license’ should win such a prestigious BBC award.

Chris Hall wrote: ‘The real travesty is that kids inspired by Lewis Hamilton will never get chances he did thanks to tax-dodgers like him.’

Another critic, John Torrie, added: ‘#SportsPersonality An oxymoron perpetuated by the choice of Lewis Hamilton. Proud to be born British but doesn’t want to live here among us.’

During his speech, Hamilton said his family were his inspiration and paused to hug his younger brother Nicholas (right) before collecting his trophy

Javier Mejia wrote: ‘Right in saying Lewis Hamilton is a UK tax exile? Given personality award by the BBC, funded by everybody’s license fee.’

Another twitter user @nick_moore added: ‘He pays no tax, has zero personality and doesn’t even have a tv licence. How does that work? @LewisHamilton #SportsPersonality #GetInspired’

But despite the controversy, with 209,920 public votes, Hamilton’s victory over second place McIlroy was decisive.

The golfer, who was the favourite of many to win the award, trailed behind with 123,745 votes while long distance runner Jo Pavey came third with 99,913 votes.

Earlier in the evening, Hamilton, 29, was joined on the red carpet not by his glamorous singer girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger but by his pet bulldog Roscoe much to the amusement of fans 

Roscoe certainly looked red carpet-ready, donning a large gold chain for the occasion

Earlier in the evening, Hamilton, 29, was joined on the red carpet not by his glamorous singer girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger but by his pet bulldog Roscoe much to the amusement of fans.

Speaking during the ceremony, Hamilton said his family were his inspiration and paused to hug his younger brother Nicholas before collecting his trophy.

He said: ‘I’m so proud and honoured to be among such great sporting talent. I want to say a huge thank you to all the people who called in, I really wasn’t expecting it.

The BBC was left red-faced when, several minutes before the official result was announced an error on its website claimed golfer Rory McIlroy was the winner.

An update to the site at 10.21 under the headline ‘McIlroy wins Sports Personality award’ said: ‘Golfer Rory McIlroy wins 2014 BBC Sports Personality of the Year.’

It was hastily removed to be replaced with the real winner Lewis Hamilton several minutes later.

‘I could not have done this without my amazing team, my family, my dad who once had four jobs to help me, my brother.

‘I’ve been incredibly inspired by them. I never thought in a million years I’d be surrounded by such people.

‘Thank you to all the fans. I always say we win and lose together because I feel your love. I feel so proud to carry the Union flag and hope I will continue to make you proud.’

Hamilton won his second Formula 1 world title last month after edging an often controversial battle with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg when he clinched the crown with victory at Abu Dhabi.

He moved to the exclusive tax haven state of Monaco in 2012 after several years living in Switzerland.

The other contenders for last night’s award were Real Madrid footballer Gareth Bale, dressage rider Charlotte Dujardin, boxer Carl Froch, skiier Kelly Gallagher and her guide Charlotte Evans, swimmer Adam Peaty, gymnast Max Whitlock and skeleton racer Lizzy Yarnold.
