A renowned poet was murdered by her stepson in an argument at her idyllic country farmhouse, a court has heard.

Writer Anne Cluysenaar, 79, was stabbed to death by stepson Timothy Jackson, 48, with a kitchen knife during a family row.

University lecturer Ms Cluysenaar was found with knife wounds to her chest and neck at her Little Wentwood Farm in Usk, South Wales.

Jackson is now facing life in prison after pleading guilty to murder at Cardiff Crown Court.

The court heard the peace of the picturesque home she had set up with Jackson's father Walter, 77, was shattered on November 1 when her stepson visited from his home in Sheffield.

The couple had celebrated their 39th wedding anniversary the day before she was murdered.

Police and paramedics were called following a violent family argument and discovered Ms Cluysenaar's body in the living room.

Prosecutor Roger Thomas QC said Jackson picked up the murder weapon from a sideboard during an argument with his stepmother.

He said: 'The knife was clearly a household knife and was in the room and when the murder took place.

'It was obviously picked up in the course of the incident that took place.'

Ms Cluysenaar and her husband lived at their cottage in South Wales for 25 years before the brutal murder

Belgium-born Ms Cluysenaar came to Britain after her family fled the Nazis during World War Two.

She started writing poetry as an eight-year-old and went on to write hundreds of poems in her life which were printed in literary journals and magazines.

She had also lectured in literature and linguistics at universities across the country including Manchester, Dublin and Aberdeen.

Anne moved to the smallholding with her husband Walter and had lived there for more than 25 years before her brutal murder.

Jackson was remanded in custody and told to expect to serve a lengthy jail term when he is sentenced next month.
