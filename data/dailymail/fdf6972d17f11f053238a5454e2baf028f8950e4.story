Ms Scruggs, a fashion blogger and former model, made headlines in 2011 after a freak accident, in which she walked into an airplane propeller, left her without a left hand and an eye. She now uses prosthetics for both.

Mr Kennedy, the co-host of E! News, was introduced to Ms Scruggs by his colleague Giuliana Rancic following the accident, and proposed in May after a year and a half of dating.

'God has blessed me with somebody I've been waiting for my whole life,' he recently told E! News. 'Lauren changed everything for me and I can't believe I get to spend the rest of my life with her.'

'Jason has completely changed my life, and I could not be more thankful for who he is and how he loves me. I can't wait to spend forever with him,' Ms Scruggs added.
