A 5p charge for plastic bags expected to cut their use by at least three-quarters will be introduced next year, the Queen told Parliament today.

The levy - applying to supermarkets and larger stores - is to be implemented by the Government following a six-year campaign by the Daily Mail.

Prime Minister David Cameron had previously warned stores that unless they significantly cut the numbers of bags being handed out, they would be forced to start charging customers – but the numbers given away have risen.

Eight billion used in England each year: Environmental campaigners say the carriers, each used for just 20 minutes on average, take up to 1,000 years to degrade (file picture)

More than eight billion disposable bags are used in England each year, or a staggering 130 per person.

Environmental campaigners say the carriers, each used for just 20 minutes on average, take up to 1,000 years to degrade.

As well as causing serious harm to marine animals and birds, they blight Britain’s coastline, with 70 bags littering every mile.

Today’s Queen’s Speech, setting out the coalition’s programme for its final eleven months in power before the general election, confirmed plans to legislate for a 5p charge to be implemented by next October.

The Queen told MPs and peers: 'My government will continue to implement major reforms to the electricity market and reduce the use of plastic carrier bags to help protect the environment.'

The new plastic bag charge is expected
 to raise millions of pounds a year for charities and good causes likely
 to be nominated by stores.

Small and medium sized businesses, with 500 
employees or fewer, will be excluded to protect independent retailers.

'We are not trying to tax people. We are trying to change people’s behaviour, encourage much more environmentally-friendly behaviour'

Ministers expect the measure, which will require secondary legislation, to reduce bag use by between 75 and 80 per cent.

A similar charge applying to single-use carrier bags has already been introduced in Wales and Northern Ireland, and dramatically reduced their use. Retailers in Scotland will start charging for bags in October 2014.

Liberal Democrat sources claim the scheme faced opposition from the Treasury, which was concerned about being seen to impose extra costs on shoppers.

But the success of charges in Wales 
and Northern Ireland – and the public support they appear to command – 
means the move has now attracted cross-party backing.

The
 Mail launched its Banish the Bags campaign in 2008 in an effort to 
reduce the waste, cost and environmental damage associated with the 
billions of plastic bags given away each year, a symbol of our throwaway
 society.

It swiftly 
received cross party political support and was backed by a string of 
major retailers, ranging from Marks & Spencer to Debenhams, B&Q 
and WH Smith.

Evidence from 
the Republic of Ireland which introduced a bag levy in 2002 had led to a
 90 per cent reduction after its introduction in 2002.

'Changing people's behaviour': Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said the move would be a 'huge environmental step forward'

Wales implemented a 5p charge which 
was imposed on all retailers, regardless of size, in 2011. The number of
 bags used there fell dramatically too – from 130 per person each year 
to just 22.

Northern Ireland
 has also introduced a 5p levy, and Scotland will do the same next year.
 In 2011, Mr Cameron gave big stores an ultimatum, telling them to 
drastically reduce the number of plastic bags, or be forced to by law.

Green
 campaigners will welcome today’s announcement that England is to 
introduce a charge after numbers of bags handed out continued to rise.

But they have complained about the exemption of biodegradable and paper bags, some which can also cause environmental harm.

They
 also insist that small and medium sized stores should not be excluded, 
as the Government plans.

The Association of Convenience Stores, which 
represents smaller retailers, has suggested its members would be happy 
to apply the charge too.

Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said the move would be a ‘huge environmental step forward’.

‘We are very clear that none of this 
money will come to government - we are not trying to tax people. We are 
trying to change people’s behaviour, encourage much more 
environmentally-friendly behaviour,’ he said.

Ministers have previously suggested money raised by the new levy should go mainly to environmental charities.

Groups such as the Campaign to Protect Rural England, Keep Britain Tidy, the Marine Conservation Society and Surfers Against Sewage have long backed the idea of a charge, saying plastic bags are littering England’s streets, countryside and beaches.

They say carriers are extremely harmful to many species of wildlife which become entangled in them or mistake them for food.

In a joint statement last night, Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said that the speech - to be delivered by the Queen in the ceremonial highlight of the Parliamentary year - would be ‘unashamedly pro-work, pro-business and pro-aspiration’.

The ‘revolution’ in pensions which forms the centrepiece of the Government’s final legislative programme will amount to ‘the biggest transformation in our pensions system since its inception’, and will ‘give people both freedom and security in retirement’, they said.

‘By no longer forcing people to buy an annuity, we are giving them total control over the money they have put aside over their lifetime and greater financial security in their old age.’

Government sources said a packed programme of 16 or 17 bills would demonstrate that the coalition has not run out of steam in the closing stages of the Parliament as they try to counter allegations that the final year of the Coalition will be little more than a ‘zombie’ Parliament.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said the programme did not address the challenges faced by Britain.

‘We would have a Queen’s Speech with legislation which would make work pay, reform our banks, freeze energy bills and build homes in in Britain,’ he said.
