A mother who was told to have an abortion because her baby’s chance of survival was so low has given birth to Britain’s only ‘double dwarf’.

Nathan Phillips, who is three months old, was born healthy and fit to Laura Whitfield, 24, and her fiancé, Nathan Phillips, 34, both of whom have restricted growth.

Both of the parents have different forms of dwarfism and the new arrival has stunned medical experts by inheriting both types.

As a result, his mother has hailed him a 'double dwarf'.

Baby Nathan Phillips is believed to be the only person in the UK with two forms of dwarfism. His parents, Nathan and Laura, both have different types of dwarfism and the baby inherited both

Though doctors do not yet know what impact it will have on the baby they say there is no reason to believe he won’t lead a relatively normal life.

Ms Whitfield, from Sunderland, said that his safe arrival was a huge relief after she was advised early in the pregnancy that the baby may only survive half an hour, if born alive.

Doctors told her to consider an abortion after irregularities in scans caused professionals to worry the youngster had inherited a deadly combination of genes. 

But Ms Whitfield, who had complications throughout the pregnancy, ignored advice and decided to carry on with the pregnancy.

Nathan's parents were advised to abort him as doctors feared he would not survive for more than an hour after his birth, if he survived the birth

Mr Phillips and Ms Whitfield refused to abort their baby and Nathan is now a healthy three-month-old

She was then told that both she and the baby would need special care after the birth - if he survived.

The mother prepared herself for the prospect of not seeing her newborn baby after having a C-section under general anaesthetic.

Doctors say they are not aware of any other babies in the UK who share Nathan Phillips' combination of dwarfism.

Dr Michael Wright, a consultant clinical geneticist at Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital Trust said: 'Nathan has achondroplasia and pseudoachondroplasia and although the two have similar names they are two very difference and distinct conditions.

'They are a combination I have personally seen before - but only in a child in the U.S. in 1997.

'It is a very rare condition and I am not aware of anymore children in our region with it, and I have sought advice from other colleagues in other parts of the country, and they too are not aware of any other children who have both.'

Dr Wright, who is Nathan's consultant, added: 'It is not a common combination.'

Dr Anand Saggar, a consultant in clinical genetics at London’s St George's Hospital and also in Harley Street, told MailOnline it is rare for a child to have two different forms of dwarfism.

He said that both pseudoachondroplasia and achondroplasia are both dominant genetic conditions.

This means that if a couple who each have a different form of dwarfism have a child, that child will have:

A 25 per cent chance of inheriting neither condition, a 25 per cent chance of inheriting both conditions and a 50 per cent chance of inheriting one but not the other.

He explained that children with two different form of dwarfism are likely to have 'poorer outcomes' than those that just have one type.

This is because they can develop symptoms associated with each of the two conditions.

But she was amazed when she woke from the operation to find her fiancé sitting at her bedside with the newborn by his side.

Ms Whitfield, who has appeared in a number of films such as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, said: ‘I was having scans once a week because they were a little worried there could be complications.

‘It wasn’t until 24 or 25 weeks that things started changing. They noticed that his measurements weren’t quite what they should be.

‘They thought that he had inherited two rare genes that could have been dangerous.

‘I was told to consider abortion and told that if he had these genes he would probably die within half an hour of birth.

‘I didn’t even think about abortion 
at any point - I don’t believe in abortion. I could feel him moving 
around inside me - he was a little wriggler. In my head everything was 
fine.

‘When I went down
 to theatre to have him I was so worried - they had been very cautious 
with us and said that there was a high chance we would need special care
 after he was born and that I might not see him.

‘When I woke up Nathan was stood next to me with little Nathan in a cot. I couldn’t believe it - I just cried.’

Ms Whitfield, who is the only person 
with dwarfism in her family, has achondroplasia - meaning she has 
shortened limbs as well as a curvature of the spine - causing serious 
pain.

Mr Phillips, who lived in Bristol 
before meeting Ms Whitfield, has a different form of dwarfism - 
pseudoachondroplasia, which means his bone growth is stunted and he has 
weak hips.

Experts fear
 that baby Nathan may inherit back and hip problems due to having both 
strands of dwarfism, but it is not yet known if he will have either.

His mother said that she hopes Nathan will be able to live a normal life, much like herself, despite his condition.

She
 added that while she was sure Nathan was the only person in the UK to 
become a 'double dwarf', the condition had been heard of elsewhere in 
the world.

Doctors do not really know what impact the 'double dwarfism' will have on Nathan but they believe he has every chance of leading a relatively normal life

She said: ‘Nathan has inherited both forms of dwarfism and is therefore a double dwarf.

‘The doctors have never come across it before. They have heard about it but they really don’t know much - they have no idea what the problems caused will be or anything.

‘At the moment they are watching him quite carefully because they don’t really know what to expect.

‘The problem is that because of his dwarfism big Nathan has very bad hips, which causes him to walk a little unusually.

‘My dwarfism means I have a curvature of the spine and am often in a lot of pain.

Ms Whitfield said: 'I didn't even think about abortion at any point - I don't believe in abortion. I could feel him moving around inside me - he was a little wriggler. In my head everything was fine'

Mr Phillips and Ms Whitfield (left) hope their baby will lead a relatively normal life, as they do

‘We are hoping that little Nathan will get my hips and his dad’s spine so that he can avoid both these problems but I guess ultimately he might end up with both.

‘I am hoping that he will have a fairly normal life like I have had.

‘My family are all normal size so nothing was ever really adapted for me - I would just have to work around it.

‘I’m not sure he is the only person in the world with the condition but he is certainly the only person in the UK.

‘Doctors have heard a bit about it before so it might be that people in America or something have had it before.’

Mr Phillips has problems with his hips and Ms Whitfield has a curved spine which causes her a lot of pain. Doctors are worried that Nathan might develop both of these problems

Mr Phillips and Ms Whitfield met in December 2012 whilst performing in pantomime on the Channel 4 documentary Seven Dwarves.

The pair got engaged in March 2013 and Laura became pregnant in April 2013, though they had not been trying for a baby.

Despite the new arrival delaying marriage plans, the couple hope to tie the knot later this year or early next year.

Though they are not quite sure what 
is in store with baby Nathan they say they will remain patient in the 
hope he will lead a life as enjoyable as theirs.

Ms Whitfield said: ‘I wouldn’t have been able to cope if little Nathan hadn’t made it.

‘We
 really aren’t sure what we can expect to happen with little Nathan now,
 doctors have said he probably won’t start learning to walk until he is 
at least 18 months.

‘I guess we will just have to be patient and make sure we don’t pick him up or discourage him in any way.’

Doctors today confirmed they were not aware of any other babies in the UK who shared Nathan Phillips' combination of conditions.

Dr Michael Wright, a consultant clinical geneticist at Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital Trust said: 'Nathan has achondroplasia and pseudoachondroplasia and although the two have similar names they are two very difference and distinct conditions.

'They are a combination I have personally seen before - but only in a child in the States in 1997.

'It is a very rare condition and I am not aware of anymore children in our region with it, and I have sought advice from other colleagues in other parts of the country, and they too are not aware of any other children who have both.'

Dr Wright, who is Nathan's consultant, added: 'It is not a common combination.'
