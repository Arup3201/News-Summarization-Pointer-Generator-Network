The contentious moment of the game was Juan Mata not being given offside when he scored the second goal.

Mata was not offside when the initial cross was sent in by Ashley Young towards Robin van Persie but he was when the Dutchman headed the ball. 

At full speed it was impossible to be 100 per cent certain that Van Persie had touched the ball. 

Juan Mata should have been given offside but it was a tough call for the officials

Robin van Persie got a slight flick on the way through but it was almost impossible to know that at full speed

The assistant referee was Mike Mullarkey, who has experience of officiating in a World Cup final. He didn’t flag and I could see exactly why he didn’t!

Perhaps better communication between the referee, Martin Atkinson, and Mullarkey could have led to the correct outcome.

But given the weekend of poor decisions, this was a minor and understandable incident. It was only clear when Van Persie himself admitted heading the ball in a post-match interview.
