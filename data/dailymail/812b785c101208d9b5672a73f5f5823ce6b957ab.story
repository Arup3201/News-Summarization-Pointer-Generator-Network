Caretaker boss Kenny McDowall fears Rangers could be run out of the play-offs entirely – after they threw away a late lead against Queen of the South to draw 1-1.

On a night when John Greig, Walter Smith and John Brown returned to sit in the main stand alongside the new board - following the suspension of their predecessors earlier in the day - the team couldn’t match the renewed sense of optimism around Ibrox.

Dropping another two points not only means Hearts can win the Championship title before the month is out, it also keeps Rangers in third place behind Hibs - with last night’s visitors only six points adrift.

Asked if he thought that either the Dumfries side or Falkirk could pip his team to the final play-off spot, McDowall said: ‘There is every chance. They are playing for the play-offs as much as we are. So we can’t be disrespectful of them.

‘Queen of the South are a good side, as are Falkirk. They are looking to win games like we’re looking to win games. We’ve got to work harder to turn it about.

‘I think it’s going to go right to the wire, the play-off places, without a shadow of a doubt. We have to find a formula to get winning again, We are stuttering along.

‘We’re not doing enough in front of goal and obviously not doing well enough to defend our goal. It’s nothing other than hard work until we get back to winning games.’

McDowall, who has won only three of his 10 games in charge since stepping in for Ally McCoist, said he hadn’t yet been told if the new board had accepted the resignation he handed to the previous regime.

‘No - I would expect them to come to me, as opposed me going to them,’ he said. ‘I’ve got games to concentrate on with the team, I’m here to do that. I’m sure if the board want to keep me they’ll come and speak to me.’

A cool Haris Vuckic finish following a goalmouth scramble with 13 minutes remaining should have been enough to give Rangers an ill-deserved three points from a bitty performance.

But Queens equalised three minutes from time, 17-year-old sub Aidan Smith on the spot – and granted plenty of time - to bury the rebound from a Michael Paton shot following a defensive mistake by home sub Bilel Moshni.

The home team left the field to a smattering of boos from the second biggest Ibrox crowd of the season.

McDowall said: ‘It’s very disappointing, when supporters had come out, the new board is in place and the stadium is full. You get the lead and you are hoping to see it out – and don’t do it through poor, poor defending.’

Queens moved a point clear in the fourth and final play-off spot, although boss James Fowler believed his team could have won, declaring: ‘It would have been a travesty had we not got anything out of it. We were the better team and had the better chances.

‘But the boys reacted well after going behind and we are delighted young Aidan got the goal.

‘Rangers came out fast but we then controlled the game and some of our passing was excellent. We are happy with the point but, being greedy, I’d have liked the three. It’s still going to be difficult to make the play-offs. There are a few clubs in there but we will keep going.’

Goalscorer Smith, making just his second appearance for the club, said: ‘It’s the best feeling ever. The ball just fell at my feet and I managed to lift it over the keeper. I actually thought Michael Paton was going to score before I did. My dad was in the crowd tonight but I haven’t yet had a chance to speak to him. My mum was due to be here but she cancelled and she’ll be gutted about that now!’
