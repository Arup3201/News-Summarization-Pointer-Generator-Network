Former Marussia test driver Maria de Villota has been found dead in a Spanish hotel room.

De Villota, who was just 33 years old, was already dead by the time the emergency services arrived at the hotel in Seville. Initial reports claim there was no sign of violence.

Spanish police have confirmed her death, and say it appears she died of natural causes, with newspaper El Mundo claiming she suffered a cardiac arrest. 'We are assuming it was a natural death, but we cannot confirm anything,' a police spokeswoman said.

She was doing a lot for the community, so very sad news.'McLaren driver Jenson Button

De Villota lost her right eye as a result and required multiple operations to repair the damage to her face and skull. 

In a statement released on Friday, Marussia said: 'It is with great sadness that we learned a short time ago of the news that Maria de Villota has passed away.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Maria’s family and friends at this very difficult time.'

In
 October last year De Villota gave her first interview to Spanish 
magazine Hola!, the accompanying pictures revealing the remarkable 
recovery she had made from her injuries.

Moments after climbing from the cockpit of his Ferrari after the second practice session for this Sunday’s Japanese Grand Prix, fellow Spaniard Fernando Alonso said: ‘I had just taken off my crash helmet when they told me. I don’t know what to say. Pray for her, for her family and for the whole motorsport family. She was loved by everybody. I don’t really know what to say.’

FOTA,chairman and McLaren team boss Martin Whitmarsh added: 'The whole paddock is very shocked by the news that Maria is no longer with us. She was an inspiration not just to women in this sport, but also to all those who suffered life-threatening injuries. Her story, determination and subsequent inspiration flowed from F1 through sport as a whole, and to see the images of her in Barcelona on the grid earlier this year, surrounded by a throng of jubilant children, told a great story.

'Maria participated in the Manhattan Fans' Forum on behalf of her team, Marussia F1, last year, and made a lasting impression on the fans who attended. She will be sadly missed, and we wish to pass on our sincere condolences to her family.'

Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn, who worked alongside De Villota as an ambassador for the Women in Motorsport commission, paid her own tribute.

'It didn't take her any time at all until she was back (from her accident) and was planning to maybe even drive,' Kaltenborn told BBC Radio 5Live.

'But more important for her was to really go out there and give other people the courage that you can still do so much, even if you have such a major setback.

'She's been one of the pillars of the work the FIA ambassador programme has been doing, because when you go out there you need to have credibility, a strong personality and you need to be able to reach out to people and that's all she could do.

'She had such a tragic experience and yet she had all that courage to be out there and talk about it and still to believe in that cause, and she always had that smile on her face.'

British racer Susie Wolff, a development driver for Williams, said: 'I feel I owe it to her (to say 
something) because, out of the paddock and out of the motorsport bubble,
 she was an incredible character, she was a fighter.

'She had such a spirit for life 
and what she came through was a testament to her strength of character 
and her positive outlook.

Prior to being handed the chance with Marussia, De Villota had raced in diverse motorsport categories such as Spanish Formula Three and the World Touring Car Championship. She had also taken part in the prestigious Daytona 24 hour race in the USA.

Any possible links between her death and injuries she suffered in her crash last year will be examined.

An HSE spokeswoman said an investigation launched immediately after the accident was continuing and any post-mortem findings and other developments following her death would be considered.

She added: 'We don't know if there is a link between her injuries and her subsequent death but we would expect to be kept informed of any new evidence.'

Despite spending a month in hospital following the Duxford Aerodrome incident, De Villota rebuilt her life in what was seen by many as a miracle recovery.
