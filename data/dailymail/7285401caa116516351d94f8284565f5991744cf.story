Despite smartphones getting thinner and faster, they still fall foul of bad reception.

But a new Reach79 case claims to solve the problem of signal dropping out, by up to doubling a device’s signal strength.

This is possible thanks to a thin gold antenna that is built into the plastic case to provide better coverage, faster data speed and longer battery life, the Californian company claims.

No more black spots! A new case by Reach79 claims to solve the frustrating problem of reception dropping out, by up to doubling a device’s signal strength. It contains a gold antenna and is currently available for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets

The iPhone case was unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where its makers claimed it’s the first one that can optimise a smartphone’s performance.

‘Powered by patented antenna technology, Reach79 cases are the first performance-enhancing smartphone cases designed for speed,’ said David Vigil, CEO of the Encinitas-based firm.

‘Each case is embedded with a micro-thin, gold-plated antenna that works to increase your smartphone’s signal strength so your phone can do more for you.’ 

A thin gold antenna is sandwiched between two layers of plastic, one with protective rubber cushioning (pictured). The metal shows through the outer plastic layer to make a pattern. The combined antenna system creates superior signal reception, which enables the device to work more efficiently, the company claims

The antenna inside each case is engineered to automatically join together with an iPhone's antennas, through a process called ‘passive coupling’.

The idea is that this combined antenna system creates superior signal reception and transmission, which enables the device to work more efficiently.

The case costs $60 (£40) for an iPhone 6 and $70 (£46) for an iPhone 6 Plus. More colours and cases for other models are planned to launch

The multiplying effect is intended to work when the phone is held to the ear or in the hand, not when it is left lying on a surface.

Tests have shown that the case improves a phone’s signal strength by an average of 1.6 times, doubling it at peak performance.

But when Walt Mossberg of Recode tested the case for a week in a variety of locations around Washington DC, he experienced mixed results.

‘Roughly half the time it seemed to help, sometimes by a little and sometimes by a lot. And roughly half the time it made no difference at all,’ he wrote.

‘On a few occasions, it actually degraded the performance of my iPhone 6.’ 

The company concedes that the case’s performance depends on the phone, its carrier and location, but that consumers should see benefits including faster data speeds for web browsing and streaming music, for example, and wider coverage for less dropped calls.

It also claims that because the smartphone doesn’t have to work as hard to maintain signal, its battery will last longer.

The case, which weighs 1.27 ounces (36g) is made from thin plastic with a rubbery cushion around its edges and claims to offer protection against drops up to 6.6ft (two metres). Cut-way sections expose the gold antenna which is sandwiched between the plastic layers.

The case is currently only available for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus and costs $60 (£40) and $70 (£46) respectively. It comes in black, but more colours will be added this spring as well as cases for other handsets.

When the Reach79 case, which contains a gold antenna, is snapped on, the phone and the case are instantly paired together to form a combined antenna system with improved signal strength.

The case uses a common antenna engineering trick known as the ‘aperture coupled patch’ to transfer energy from the iPhone’s antenna to connect with the gold-plated antenna inside the case.

The technique is indirect way of feeding the antenna in the case because there’s no electrical connection.

A ‘hole’ in the Reach79 antenna directs energy from the iPhone into the antenna in the case, which is engineered to resonate at mobile phone frequencies, so the coupled energy is re-transmitted.
