The family of the window washer who fell 11 stories from a California building has raised more than $70,000 in the past month.

The family of Pedro Perez, 58, of San Leandro has raised $73, 482, nearly four times what they expected, in just a month on a GoFundMe fundraising page. 

Nearly 1,200 people have donated to the Perez family in the month since Perez took the horrible 11-story fall on Nov. 21 leaving him with a fractured pelvis, a broken arm, a ruptured artery in his arm, and severe brain trauma when he fell from a San Francisco building onto a moving Toyota Camry.

Fell: On Nov. 21, Perez fell 11 stories from a San Francisco building onto a moving Toyota Camry

Though Perez is doing better, having moved from a hospital to a rehabilitation center, Perez' medical journey is not over. And his family is left to cover medical expenses and make up for the loss in family income with Perez not working, as he is the main bread winner. 

'I just wanted to thank everyone from the bottom of our hearts on behalf of my father and my family,' Perez' 19-year-old daughter Monica wrote on the GoFundMe page.

'Thank everyone for all their support their generosity and loving comments for the family, it means a lot to us to know that we're not alone and that people are willing to give us what little they may have just to help us in this time of need.'

Perez' wife Maricela Perez, 39, and Monica have taken on the role of sole-breadwinner with Perez in rehab, still unable to walk.

Injuries: The more than 100-feet fall left Perez  with a fractured pelvis, a broken arm, a ruptured artery in his arm, and severe brain trauma

Fund: The family created the fund with a goal of $20,000 -- needed to make up the difference in Perez' yearly salary now gone and worker's compensation payments

Marciela works in a plastics factory and Monica dropped out of college to become a home care worker in order to help support the family, NBC reports.  

The couple has two other daughters, aged 16 and 11, who are still in school.

The family created the fund with a goal of $20,000 -- needed to make up the difference in Perez' yearly salary now gone and worker's compensation payments. 

Monica said on the page that with the donations the family has raised she will be able to go back to college in the summer.

She said the large amount also 'gives my father peace of mind to know that we won't have to struggle any longer with the bills, and that we are going to be OK.' 

Perez was working alongside a coworker on a window washing scaffold helping other workers by moving power chords, according to NBC.

Perez fell near the edge of the roof, down 130 feet, while handling the power chords.

He has had multiple surgeries since the incident but has amazed doctors with his rapid improvement.
