A single father who used to eat kebabs at bedtime every night, causing him to balloon to 30st has lost an incredible 10st in just 12 months after he feared leaving his daughter an orphan.

Businessman Adam Harding-Jones, 48, from Wallasey on the Wirral, shed the pounds after his junk-food diet left him with kidney failure and on the verge of a heart attack.

But Adam has swapped his gluttonous two McDonald's breakfasts and daily bedtime kebab for freshly-blended fruit and vegetables after seeing documentary Fat, Sick And Nearly Dead.

Scared his weight meant he wouldn't live to see his daughter grow up, Adam began juicing after being inspired by documentary 'Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead'

Adam, who was dubbed 'big Al' by friends for his 56in waist and 5XL size, has since slimmed down and has picked up a gruelling exercise regime.

Adam said: 'Over the last few years I felt horrendous and I felt older than I actually am.

'But now I feel a lot younger. I am doing a lot of things I never thought I'd get to do. I feel brilliant and when I think back to how ill I was and how bad I felt, I just never want to go back.'

The former policeman began to pile on the pounds when he set-up his own Swift Sure Cars chauffeur company.

Adam also suffered a blow after the breakdown of his relationship and he becoming a single parent to Amber, now 14.

Adam used food as a comfort after the break down of his marriage and would often eat vast amounts of junk

The strain saw him eat two McDonald's sandwiches for breakfast, a kebab before bed and snacking on crisps and chocolate all day.

And when Adam hit 30st on the scales, his mother feared he was going to die from a heart attack as he battled kidney failure and diabetes

Adam said: 'I knew I was on a slippery slope. My body was giving me a warning. I felt permanently not very well. I had an impending doom.

'It was scary but I didn't know what to do about it. If there was a competition for comfort eating then I'd win gold.'

But after coming across weight loss film Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead, Adam turned his life around.

Breakfast: Two McDonald's breakfasts

Snack: Sandwiches

Lunch: Pasty

Dinner: Sausage and chips

Snacks: Crisps, chocolate, kebab before bed

Breakfast: Juice made from fresh fruit and vegetables 

Lunch: Juice made from fresh fruit and vegetables

Dinner: Fish or meat with vegetables

Snacks: None 

He ditched the fatty foods and snacks and made the life-saving switch to juicing.

The new-found fitness fanatic has juice for breakfast and lunch and swapped his teatime sausage and chips for fish or meat with vegetables.

The inspiration came from his teenage daughter and she has joined him on his quest to keep fit.

Adam said: 'Juicing gets a lot of bad press but it lets me eat things that I wouldn't eat normally.

Adam says daughter Amber, 14, (left) is proud of him and has even started juicing herself 

As well as changing his diet, Adam has developed a love of exercise, especially cycling 

'I had to do it for Amber. She was embarrassed of me and wanted me to lose weight to get a girlfriend but now she's proud.

'And she's far more confident too. She has juices as well and she's far more active.'

The 38in waist slimmer has done so well to shed 10st that strangers send him messages of thanks on Facebook and he has appeared in a book from juicing expert Joe Cross.

Adam has since joined the gym and a cycling club in the Wirral and has already been in the saddle for a 50-mile ride in Staffordshire and completed Tough Mudder in September.

He has already signed up for a 100-mile race in Wales and a series of half marathons to keep himself in shape.
