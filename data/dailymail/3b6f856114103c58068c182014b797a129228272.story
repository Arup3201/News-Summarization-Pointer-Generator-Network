British manufacturers are the strongest in Europe with factory output growing at the fastest pace for nearly three years, figures showed yesterday.

The closely-watched purchasing managers’ index of activity in the sector - where scores above 50 represent growth - rose from 56.5 in October to 58.4 in November.

It was the eighth month of growth in a row, the highest level since February 2011 and significantly better than anything seen on the Continent.

New orders rose at the fastest pace for 19 years amid increased demand for British goods from Asia, the United States, Germany, France, Ireland, Belgium and the Middle East

The revival in UK manufacturing - dubbed 
the ‘march of the makers’ by George Osborne - has taken longer than hoped 
but will ease fears that the recovery is too dependent on household 
spending and the property market.

The report, by research group Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, also showed British manufacturers are creating around 5,000 jobs a month.

It was a further boost to Mr Osborne ahead of the Autumn Statement on Thursday when the Chancellor is expected to reveal that the economy is growing more than twice as fast as expected.

The Office for Budget Responsibility looks set to raise its growth forecasts for 2013 from 0.6 per cent to around 1.4 per cent.

The independent watchdog is also likely to say that the stronger than anticipated recovery means the government will borrow around £15billion less than feared this year.

James Knightley, an economist at banking group ING, said: ‘The UK economy is looking in good shape.’

The UK manufacturing PMI of 58.4 was far stronger than the score of 51.6 clocked up in the eurozone in November.

The Netherlands posted the highest score in the single currency bloc, with 56.8, but Germany only managed 52.7 and Italy 51.4 while Greece, Spain and France all saw factory output decline.

The French reading of 48.4 was the worst in the region.

‘France slipped to the bottom of the league table and was the only nation to report faster declines in both output and new orders,’ said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.

‘There’s still a lot to worry about in terms of the health of the eurozone economy. The big concern is France.’

New orders rose at the fastest pace for 19 years amid increased demand for British goods from Asia, the United States, Germany, France, Ireland, Belgium and the Middle East.

The report also showed that more jobs are being created in the sector than at any time since May 2011.

Markit said the figures suggested that manufacturing is on course to beat the 0.9 per cent growth it notched up in the third quarter of the year with the pace of growth so far in the fourth quarter comfortably above the 1 per cent mark.

This year 1.73billion bricks will be produced in the UK, the highest number since before the 2008 financial crash, according to the Brick Development Association

David Noble, chief executive of CIPS, hailed an ‘all-round glowing performance’ for the sector.

Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘The improvement in manufacturing in November should help to ease concerns that the recovery is entirely founded on an unsustainable housing market boom.’

The news came after it emerged last 
week that factories will produce 1.73billion bricks in 2013, enough to 
go 9 times round the earth.

Ministers say the humble brick is a key barometer of economic growth, and demand is up by 18 per cent on last year.

Orders
for bricks are so high that kilns will be kept firing over Christmas 
for the first time since 2007 before the financial crash sent 
construction into freefall.

The
1.73billion bricks manufactured in 2013 is up from the 1.46billion 
produced last year, and the highest since 2.39billion made in 2007.

Housing
Minister Kris Hopkins said the government’s flagship Help to Buy 
mortgage scheme had helped to persuade builders to kickstart 
construction across the country.
