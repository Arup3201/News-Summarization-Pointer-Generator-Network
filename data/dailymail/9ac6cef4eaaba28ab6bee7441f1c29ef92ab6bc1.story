This is the incredible moment a racing driver jumps over a group of bikini-clad models as they relax on a beach.

Daredevil B.J Baldwin got behind the wheel of his customised, 850bhp off-road truck in the desert outside Ensenada, Mexico.

He was then given 20 minutes to get to the tourist resort's beach as part of a bet with his friend, American playboy Dan Bilzerian.

Baldwin heads off in the 150mph truck and pulls off a series of jaw-dropping manoeuvres as he powerslides around corners en route to the town.

Stunned onlookers watch the truck's shock absorbers take a battering as Baldwin hurtles through public roads.

As he approaches the coastline, Baldwin takes a leap over a set of steps, just as a group of four beauties sit beneath.

The truck, which does just 3.1mpg and features a suspension which has 26-inches of travel, clears the ladies and Baldwin is on the beach.

He makes it to Bilzerian - but he is just over a second late.

It is the first time a full blown race car of any sorts been set free on public roads of Ensenada in the middle of the day, full of people and traffic.

The jaw-dropping stunt, shot by Monster Energy, is the follow-up to Recoil, a similar film from last year which has been viewed almost seven million times on YouTube.Â
