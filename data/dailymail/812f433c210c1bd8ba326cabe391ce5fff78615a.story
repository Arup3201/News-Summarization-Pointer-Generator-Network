A state government in Germany has stopped the distribution of thousands of calendars and ordered their destruction after discovering the cover photo was an idyllic shot of Hitler deputy Hermann Goering's country home.

Goering - Luftwaffe chief, founder of the Gestapo and a key architect of the programme to exterminate the Jews - also held the title of chief huntsman in the Third Reich. 

He entertained lavishly at a hunting estate called Carinhall 50 miles north of Berlin during WW2.

The lodge pictured was part of Goering's hunting estate - the rest of which was blown up as the Soviets approached in 1945

Carinhall was blown up on his orders when the Soviets approached in 1945. But several buildings survived, including a half-timbered, thatched lodge which appeared on the front of a calendar produced by the agricultural ministry of the state of Brandenburg.

When it was pointed out who the previous owner was the ministry went into overdrive to pulp the calendars.

The intention was to promote forestry in the depressed region north of the capital - but the association with a mass murderer of the Nazis was too much.

The ministry admitted that the accompanying text to the photo was ‘insenstive,’ missing out on any mention of Goering's crimes.
