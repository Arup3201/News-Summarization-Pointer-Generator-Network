Tube delays, soaring prices, feral youths, rioting... you would think such things would deter tourists from visiting London.

But now, for the first time ever, Britain's capital city has been named the best place to visit on the planet - after jumping from eighth to first place.

And with the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the Olympics almost upon us, it could not have come at a better time.

To celebrate the forthcoming Diamond Jubilee of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, 147 Union flags are flying above Oxford Street. The display represents 147 years of fashion on the world famous high street

According to the research, carried out by tourist feedback website TripAdvisor, one of the favourite attractions is West End show War Horse

The league table, compiled by tourist feedback website TripAdvisor, is based on analysis of tens of millions of reviews by visitors to 440 destinations around the world, the Evening Standard reported.

Emma Shaw, TripAdvisor’s director, said: 'The capital has been very much in the spotlight over the past few years, thanks to the royal wedding, Diamond Jubilee and, of course, the Olympics, and we’re seeing travellers experience London in an increasingly favourable way.'

It is a remarkable achievement for a city that, a few years ago, was widely seen as grubby, grey and expensive.

In 2010, London did not feature in the top three in Britain, beaten by Edinburgh, Brighton and York.

London has 'more free galleries and museums than anywhere else in the world,' said one tourist from LA. Above, the British Museum

Traveller from Thailand: 'I love the flower market in east London on a Sunday morning, full of colours, and also Spitalfields market.'From Illinois, US: 'I
 love London. There is so much to do, one almost needs a month to see 
it. The city is rich in history, nostalgia. beauty… and pubs. It has 
something for everyone.' From Rome: 'So much of what London has to offer is free. It’s unbelievable.'From Portugal: 'I totally fell in love with London, its history, its monuments, its river, its parks, shopping markets etc.'From Chennai, India: 'It is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Nice parks, gardens and locations to visit. Go and check it out yourself.'From Hong Kong: 'Our visit would not be complete if we hadn’t visited a local pub and eaten fish and chips with a glass of beer.'From Haifa, Israel: 'The most interesting place I’ve ever visited.'

But the combined draw of spectacles such as the West End show War Horse and free attractions, from great museums and parks to street markets such as Portobello Road, has transformed the capital’s global image.

One traveller from Los Angeles wrote: 'London is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world. It’s a virtual historical theme park. There are more free galleries and museums than anywhere in the world.'

Gordon Innes, chief executive of the capital’s tourism agency, London & Partners, said its top position was 'a testament to the wonderful array of attractions, dining and accommodation that set London apart from all these other destinations'.

The top-rated hotels were Hotel 41 in Victoria, and the Milestone and Egerton House, both in Kensington.

Favourite attractions were West End shows War Horse and Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert and the Courtauld Gallery.

The highest rated restaurants were Pétrus in Knightsbridge, the Ledbury in Notting Hill and Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea.
