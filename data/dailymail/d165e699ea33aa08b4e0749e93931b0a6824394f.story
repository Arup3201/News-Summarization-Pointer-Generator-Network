Billy Joe Saunders has been fighting his whole life.

Growing up on a travellers site, his boxing education started not in the gym but in bare-knuckle scraps from the age of just five.

Saunders, now 25 but still living on a site in Hertfordshire with his wife and two young sons, is the great-grandson of Absolom Beeney, considered the Romany culture's finest fighter.

And on Saturday, he hopes to take another step on the road to becoming the first traveller to win a world title when he faces Chris Eubank Jnr.

'Imagine a site of 48 plots all with little kids growing up together,' he says. 'You're going out there and every single day, all it is is fighting, then playing.

'You have a game of football then you have a fight over it, then you play again. Imagine that all your life. Growing up like that does nothing but harden you inside.

'If I had a fight when I was young my mum and dad wouldn't know about it. If he [Eubank] had a fight, he'd go straight back and tell his mum. It was a natural thing for me, I've been brought up on it and it hardens you inside.

'It is 100 per cent a different experience to being a professional fighter but it hardens you and I've never ever given in in my life. I'm not that sort of person and if I was I wouldn't be in this sport.

'When you're born into it, it becomes natural. It stops when you're 15 and you're getting a bit older and you're going to work and stuff, that's when the younger kids start. It's a culture and it always happens.

'When you walk out there, some people think it would feel like, "I'm not going out there because I don't want to have a fight".

'But it's not like that with us – you have to fight. Whether you win or lose you're getting out there and having a fight, it's as simple as that.'

Saunders has vowed to retire if he loses to Eubank in a fight for the former's British, Commonwealth and European middleweight titles.

It also carries the prize of a shot at the WBO world title against the winner of Andy Lee's clash with Matt Korobov in Las Vegas next month.

And much has been made of Eubank's size advantage amid stories that he has given the likes of Carl Froch a torrid time in sparring.

But it is again to his upbringing that Saunders turns in response.

'I'll tell you a story about Tom Little, a big fella who is now a good friend of mine, but we became friends after we had a fight,' he says.

'It was something stupid, I was 16 or 17 and he was from around my end. We had an argument, he's a heavyweight, a big boy, 6 foot 6 and 18 at the time. And this was one time where if I could have talked myself out of it I would have.

'We were on the site and we just had it. There was an argument and it escalated into a little challenge to me and there were too many people there to turn it down. I would have loved to get out of it, I was thinking, "I don't need this" but I said, "if you want to fight let's have it".

Eubank Jnr has considerably less professional and amateur experience than his opponent

'We had our shirts off and we had a fight for 10 minutes. But what a good fight and I beat him. It was in a field, bare-knuckle and we shook hands afterwards and became friends, very good friends.

'But it's very hard, everything goes out the window and you stand there having it. It's pointless trying to box around and conserve energy because any minute you could get hit with a big punch and go out. You might as well get done what you can while you can.

'When you see a street fight, nobody has respect for each other and you see knives and bats out. But when you have respect for each other then it's a fair fight, you stand up and that's it. If you win or lose it's over and there's no dishonour in saying "enough".

'We're friends now but that's just an example of how it happens. It escalated out of nothing but it's more about pride than anything else.

'I've never been a bully and at that stage that sort of fight was rare because you don't get many people who want to have a fight with a boxer who is doing well in the boxing game. But it happened and thank God, I haven't had one since.'

Saunders, who represented his country at the 2008 Olympics, has won all 20 of his professional fights but admits it is only now that he has given the sport his full attention.

He adds: 'When I was in training for other fights the boys would say, “are you coming with us? We're going to the dog track”.

'Then you go to the dog track, from there you would go to the casino then you look at your watch and it's four in the morning. That's no good.

'I look back at that and I don't know how I beat some of the fighters I've beaten doing that sort of thing. I don't care how good you are, a fit man will always beat a good man who is unfit.

'In my professional boxing career I've had 20 fights and I've won those 20 fights on worth ethic alone because I haven't done my diet right, haven't lived the life and I know now I can't win a world title living the lifestyle I was living before.

'Kebabs, food, this, that, walking around at 15 stone. This time last year I was 16 stone – it was just a joke. I know I can't live that lifestyle – the elite fighters don't do it.

'When I won the European title in my last fight, the night before the weigh-in I got six-and-a-half pounds off in a sauna and I thought, "I never want to do that again".

'Some people have to learn from a loss but luckily enough I didn't have to and I got the win but I knew I had to learn from it.'
