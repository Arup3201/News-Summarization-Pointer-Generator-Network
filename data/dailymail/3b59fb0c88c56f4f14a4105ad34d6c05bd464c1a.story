A grandmother was left shaking with worry after being sent an energy bill demanding more than £9,000 - despite her really only owing her energy supplier £59.

Margaret Corey, 72, was sent a letter by British Gas claiming they were planning on taking the huge sum from her bank account within days.

She was told she owed more than £8,000 for gas and over £1,000 for electricity - 150 times more than the amount she actually had to pay.

Margaret Corey was left shocked after she received two bills from British Gas for a total of £9,000

Mrs Corey, from Fulwood, Lancashire, said: 'It said I owed £8,047 for gas and another £1,259 for electricity and that it would be taken out of my account on March 9.

'I was in total shock. For an OAP who lives on her own like me, it's enough to make you ill. Luckily I have a good neighbour who I went to see.'

Mrs Corey said she 'couldn't stop shaking' after opening the letter, that outlined how her direct debit arrangement had changed after she'd agreed to a new tariff.

When she called British Gas to inquire about the amount, she was told her combined bill should actually be £59.

She said: 'The man I spoke to just said that it was a blip. He said that there's quite a few, and its worrying that he was so calm about it.

'I'm worried about other people who have got these mistakes and how they will feel.'

Mrs Corey said she feared the money would automatically be taken out of her account after getting the letter

She added: 'And what if people don't check things like I do and British Gas try to take all that money out of their bank?

'Not many people will have that kind of cash in their account, so the payment won't go through, and that could cause all kinds of long-lasting problems.'

A spokeswoman for British Gas said it was an isolated error.

Leigh Francis said: 'When Mrs Corey contacted us about her energy tariff we set up her payment plan incorrectly.

'We've now put this right and have apologised to Mrs Corey for the distress and inconvenience and offered her a gesture of goodwill.'
