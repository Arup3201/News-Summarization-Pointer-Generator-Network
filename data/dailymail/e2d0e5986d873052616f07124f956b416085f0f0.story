Social Worker Joseph Brown was struck off after being convicted of six counts of outraging public decency and one of voyeurism

An NSPCC social worker who was caught taking indecent pictures up women’s skirts was yesterday struck off from working in the profession.

Joseph Brown was waiting for the train to his office at the children’s charity when a fellow commuter noticed he had taken an intimate photograph on his mobile phone of a woman passenger.

Brown was stopped by the man on the platform who alerted British Transport Police officers at Wimbledon Station, south London, before he was arrested.

Following an investigation, officers confiscated his home computer in which they found six more pictures, footage and videos of views up unsuspecting women’s skirts.

A film of a 'female friend' taken a few years ago while she washed in the shower at his home was also discovered on his machine by computer forensic officers.

Brown, who is believed to be in his early 40s, was convicted of six counts of outraging public decency and one of voyeurism in March this year.

He was forced to sign the sex offender’s register and participate in a treatment programme.

Yesterday, the social worker’s regulatory body, the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), struck Brown off after a fitness to practice hearing.

Brown, who arrived at the proceedings with his wife, applied to have the hearing heard in private - arguing the conviction had been a ‘very traumatic experience for me and my wife’.

‘I think the offence that occurred was when I was incredibly depressed last year,’ he told the panel of three experts.

Arguing for the case to be heard behind closed doors without the Press, he added: ‘It might be damaging for my recovery considerably.’

But he burst into tears when the HCPC panel ruled the hearing should be held in public. His wife comforted him by stroking his back, before they decided to leave just minutes later.

Brown sobbed: ‘The difficulty about it is I think about it and relive it’.

He had referred himself to the HCPC shortly after being arrested in August last year.

The hearing, in Kennington, south London, heard he was working for the NSPCC with ‘vulnerable people’ who could have been victims of sexual offences.

At the time of his arrest, Brown had 
already handed in his notice to take up a role for Wandsworth Council. 
The offence meant he did not go onto work for the local authority.

In his letter to the HCPC, Brown admitted he had taken the indecent picture at the railway station of ‘an attractive lady in a short skirt.’

The hearing, which continued in Brown’s absence ,heard HCPC presenting officer Mary Page tell the panel Brown had not just carried out a one-off crime.

She added: ‘It’s the gravity of the offence itself. This was not a single image taken on a single day, but a number of images taken over a number of days.

‘The count of voyeurism was raised from a video taken some time before August last year. This was not an isolated incident.’

The HCPC panel ruled that Brown’s fitness to practice social work had been impaired.

In its judgement, it wrote: ‘In order to maintain public confidence in the profession and the regulatory process and to uphold proper standards of conduct, the panel has concluded that [Brown’s] fitness to practice is currently impaired.’

Brown, who had written saying he no longer wished to continue to work in the social care profession, was struck off.
