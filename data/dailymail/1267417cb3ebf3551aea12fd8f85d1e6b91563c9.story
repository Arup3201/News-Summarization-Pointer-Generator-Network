Police today launched an investigation into allegations that a great-grandmother suffering from dementia was left to sleep overnight on a mattress on a hospital floor.

Bernice Zair, 89, was admitted to Darlington Memorial Hospital in December last year for a water infection and was only expected be in for a few days.

When her son Sam and his wife went to visit they claim they found Mrs Zair in a room on her own curled up on a mattress facing the skirting board.Â 

Mrs Zair's daughter-in-law, Lesley, said: 'I 
wouldn't treat my dog like this. There was not 
even a pillow under Sam's mum's head.'

'I was just horrified to see a mattress on the floor with Sam's lovely mum curled up on it.'

Sam Zair, a County Durham Councillor and cafe owner in Bishop Auckland said: 'We couldn't believe what we were seeing.'

He said his mother had initially spent 72 hours on a ward before being transferred to the room.

She later contracted pneumonia while at the hospital and died on January 18 this year.

Mr Zair is also making a complaint about the lack of staff on duty, many of whom were from an agency.

'As a family we are absolutely distraught and I am absolutely disgusted by the way a certain ward in Darlington treated my mother.'

He was one of the leaders of the 'Save Our Hospital' campaign which tried to prevent the scrapping of 24-hour emergency care at the Bishop Auckland General Hospital.

He said: 'With living in Bishop Auckland, mam would have been treated a lot quicker and there would have been a greater continuity of care, it would have been a lot better.'

Paying tribute to Mrs Zair, he said: 'She
worked right up beyond retirement, she used to help out in the shop. She was a fantastic cook, she liked to please everyone.'

A spokesman for County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We offer our condolences to Mr Zair for his recent loss.'

'We have made Mr Zair aware that we cannot complete our investigation until the police investigation is complete.'
