Douglas Flint, HSBC chairman, who has criticised the time it takes to comply with new banking regulations

HSBC staff are suffering from fatigue as they struggle with tighter restrictions on how they sell investments, the bank’s chairman said yesterday.

Revealing a slump in profits and a spiralling compensation bill for mis-selling, Douglas Flint criticised the time and money needed to comply with the ‘unprecedented’ raft of new regulations.

These include a crackdown on financial advice to protect customers after a series of scandals, and ‘ring-fencing’ rules that force lenders to insulate their high street retail arms from their investment banks.

He said staff were reluctant to sell anything but the simplest products because they were nervous about falling foul of City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority. 

He claimed beleaguered staff were tired out from having to work on Saturdays and Sundays to adapt to the regulations, adding that there were ‘only 52 weekends in the year’.

HSBC revealed yesterday it had been told to assign £218million to compensate thousands of personal loan customers after it omitted crucial information from their annual statements that would have shown they could overpay their loans without penalty. 

In doing so, it breached the Consumer Credit Act. It has been warned it faces a bill of almost £600million if other breaches are found.

The bank also said it has been forced to set aside another £115million to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance, taking its total PPI bill to more than £2billion. 

Profits in the first half of the year fell 12 per cent to £7.3billion. But its shares nudged up 0.9 per cent to 635p last night. And MPs have shown little sympathy for Mr Flint’s complaints.

Mark Garnier, a Tory on the Treasury Select Committee and former member of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, said: ‘When staff are nervous about selling more complicated products, I say thank God for that. If they are worried something is dodgy then we’ve got where we want to be.’

Labour’s John Mann, who also sits on the committee, said: ‘HSBC would feel less tired if they treated people decently and stopped ripping people off.’

HSBC was one of the few high street lenders to emerge from the financial crisis with its reputation largely intact. But it was fined £10.5million in 2011 after a subsidiary lured vulnerable customers into gambling their nest eggs. 

Its reputation was damaged further in 2012 when it was fined £1.2billion for breaching US money-laundering laws and described as being the ‘bank of choice’ for Mexican drug gangs.
