Knight and damsel: Tony Robinson, 66, with his wife Louise, 32

It must be a cunning plan – for while actor Tony Robinson, who played Baldrick the downtrodden servant in Blackadder, is knighted in today’s Birthday Honours, there is just a CBE for his scheming master Rowan Atkinson.

Robinson,
whose character was famed for his shabbiness and lack of hygiene, 
admitted he was ‘a little gob-smacked’ at being honoured and joked that 
he would now be rescuing damsels in distress and slaughtering dragons if
the need arose.

More 
seriously, he added: ‘I’ll use my new title to highlight the causes I 
believe in, particularly the importance of culture, the arts and 
heritage in our society, and the plight of the infirm elderly and their 
carers.’

With his catchphrase ‘I have a cunning plan’, Robinson became Britain’s favourite dogsbody as the long-suffering Baldrick.

And as a history-mad presenter on Time Team, he has dug up some of the country’s most prestigious archaeological sites.

But
his knighthood reflects neither his popularity as a sitcom star nor as a
history buff. Instead, the 66-year-old actor was recommended for his 
‘public and political service’ as a Labour party activist.

His
name was put forward by the Parliamentary and Political Services 
Committee, set up last year by David Cameron to reward party workers. 
Robinson was a member of Labour’s National Executive Committee for four 
years during the Blair era, and spent four years as vice-president of 
the Left-wing actors’ union Equity.

His activism has never been low-key – wherever there’s a high-profile Leftie cause, he can often be found waving his red flag.

When
Bono and Bob Geldof were handing out Make Poverty History wristbands in
the run-up to the G8 summit in 2005, Robinson was one of the most 
vociferous showbusiness supporters. His involvement with Comic Relief 
has seen him make several documentaries in Africa.

In Britain, he rarely seems to miss a 
demo. At the TUC rally against the Coalition’s spending cuts in March 
2011 he was a keynote speaker, and alongside hard-Left Labour MP Diane 
Abbott he campaigns on issues such as housing and welfare benefits in 
Hackney, the London borough where he grew up.

Success: Robinson was a little-known actor before Blackadder

Robinson
was a little-known actor before Blackadder. But his career had begun 
with a West End success – he was spotted in an amateur show and offered a
part as one of Fagin’s boys in the original 1960 production of Lionel 
Bart’s musical, Oliver!

One night, as understudy, he stood in at short 
notice for the Artful Dodger. The experience left him with a love of 
comedy acting. He spent years in repertory, then set up a community 
theatre group.

By the time 
he was cast as Baldrick in 1983, he was in his late 30s with two 
children. He felt distanced from the rest of the cast: Rowan Atkinson, 
Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, and writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, 
were all young graduates.

The
son of a council worker, Robinson had left school after gaining four 
O-levels. ‘The impression you got was that they slid off the silver 
spoon straight into the rehearsal room at BBC TV Centre,’ he said.

Four
series of Blackadder made him a household name, but it was a chance 
encounter with archaeology professor Mick Aston during a holiday in the 
Greek islands that led to Robinson’s most long-lived TV role – as the 
eager amateur on Time Team, leaping into Roman excavations or medieval 
ruins to uncover fragments of history.

His enthusiasm was contagious, and the country fell in love with archaeology. Even the Royal Family were swept along.

When
Robinson was invited to a garden party at Buckingham Palace, the Queen,
the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles became engrossed in 
conversation about what a Time Team dig could discover at the royal 
sites.

New career: Mr Robinson forged a second life as the presenter of Time Team on Channel 4

Robinson’s private 
life has been colourful. He had a short-lived first marriage, when he 
was 21, and since Time Team launched in 1994, he has had long-term 
relationships with his admin assistant Heledd Matthias, and with 
singer-songwriter Teri Bramah.

Two
years ago, he married his statuesque partner Louise Hobbs, who is 34 
years his junior and, at 5ft 9in, five inches taller than him. She is 
also younger than both his children from his 20-year relationship with 
Bristol solicitor Mary Shepherd.

The
knighthood will further increase his profile. He once said: ‘Blackadder
fans call out, “I have a cunning plan”. Time Team lovers want me to dig
up their garden … while the Tories shout: “You Labour idiot!” ’ From 
now on, perhaps that should be ‘Sir Labour idiot’.
