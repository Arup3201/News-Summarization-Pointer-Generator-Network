An Italian town has been accused of instituting ‘apartheid’ after unveiling plans for a separate bus for Roma.

The mayor of Borgaro outside Turin has backed the controversial plan to create a segregated bus route for residents of the Roma encampment after years of complaints from local residents.

Inhabitants of the town have allegedly suffered years of aggression and pickpocketing on the current bus route which passes the huge camp, based in a former barracks off the city's ring road.

Plans for a separate bus route for Roma were presented at the town hall in Borgaro (pictured) and were supported by residents 

Alleged incidents on route 69, known as ‘the gipsy bus’ have included passengers who were spat on, a young girl whose hair was cut off, and another whose hair was set on fire.

Under plans which won the mayor Claudio Gambino's support at a town hall meeting this week, a new bus will run parallel to the current route and end at the Roma camp.

Italian newspaper La Stampa said in an editorial that the measures amounted to 'apartheid' but acknowledged that something had to be done.

Mr Gambino, of the centre left PD party, denied racism and said it was ‘the only solution.’

The town outside Turin in north west Italy has been accused of instituting an 'apartheid' for its segregation of bus passengers 

He told Italian media: ‘This way we will resolve the problem without anyone losing out, ’ adding ‘It is not about xenophobia, but security and legality.’

The decision recalls pre-civil rights America and apartheid policies carried out in South Africa when blacks and whites had to travel on separate public transport.

Eight out of ten Italians take extra care with their wallet if they see a Roma person on the bus, according to a poll by Avvenire, a Catholic newspaper.
