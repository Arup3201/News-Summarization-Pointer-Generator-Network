It was an exit done with a flourish. Having arrived in Plymouth by Royal Train, the Queen took a more direct route home and was picked up from the flight deck of HMS Ocean by a helicopter.

Smiling broadly as she climbed into the aircraft, the Queen, who had just completed a tour of the enormous vessel, was waved out of sight by sailors.

Her Majesty travelled down to the Devonshire port early this morning and arrived shortly after the eclipse.

Back to London: The Queen's flight banks before starting its journey north to London

Resplendent in a bright purple ensemble, the Queen was without the Duke of Edinburgh who had remained behind in London. 

Greeted by Sir Eric Dancer, the Lord-Lieutenant of Devon,  the Queen stopped to say hello to the waiting crowds before being driven to HMNB Devonport in her official state Bentley which had been driven down for the occasion.

The Queen is the sponsor of HMS Ocean, a titanic helicopter carrier that came into service in 1998 and has seen service in the Gulf and the Mediterranean among others.

Ocean, which glories in the nickname of 'The Mighty O' within the Royal Navy, was also deployed to Greenwich in 2012 to help provide security during the Olympics.

Docked on a bend of the Thames, the gargantuan ship towered over river traffic and even managed to make the huge O2 arena look comparatively small. 

Looking around: The Queen is shown around the flight deck by Ocean's captain, Timothy Henry

All smiles: The Queen, who had lunch onboard the ship, appeared to enjoy her day

Rising up: The Queen has a go on the elevator used to lift aircraft to Ocean's deck

Taking an interest: The Queen has now visited HMS Ocean on four separate occasions

Involved: Her Majesty is kept updated about the progress of the ship and its activities

Royal visit: The Queen inspects her honour guard during a re-dedication ceremony for HMS Ocean

The Queen, who was making her fourth visit to the ship, was welcomed to Devonport, the Royal Navy's Plymouth base, where she was welcomed by Vice Admiral Philip Jones to the sound of a 21-gun royal salute.

Joined by Devonport's commanding officer, Captain Ian Shipperley and Captain Timothy Henry of HMS Ocean, she then heard the National Anthem ahead of a re-dedication ceremony for the ship.

Her Majesty, who was wearing the same cheerful ensemble worn for last year's Christmas Day service at Sandringham, then inspected a guard of honour drawn from the men and women serving on Ocean.

She also was also shown around the helicopter carrier before being treated to lunch in Ocean's Wardroom. 

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'Every Royal Navy warship has a Lady Sponsor and Her Majesty The Queen holds this title with Ocean.

'The relationship continues throughout the life of the ship, each successive Captain keeping Her Majesty informed of the ship's activities and hosting visits.

'The rededication ceremony marks the ship's return to operational service following completion of her refit and subsequent work up.

Big arrival: The Royal Train pulls into Plymouth Station after a three-hour journey from London

On duty: The Queen, who was wearing a cheerful purple ensemble, steps off the train at Plymouth

Warm welcome: The Queen was met by Sir Eric Dancer (centre) and the Lord Mayor of Plymouth, Mike Fox

Cheers: The Queen was met at the station by a flag-waving crowd and was presented with several posies

Cheerful: The Queen makes her way out of the station clutching a pretty posy of spring flowers

On her way: The Queen's official state Bentley had been driven down to meet her at the station

'It provides an appropriate occasion for Her Majesty The Queen to reaffirm publicly her link to HMS Ocean and meet the new crew.'

HMS Ocean is one of the most important ships in the Royal Navy and is used to deploy Royal Marines directly into war zones via helicopter or landing craft.

As a result, the 380-strong ship's company includes the 9 Assault Squadron Royal Marines who operate the ship's four Mk5 landing craft.

The ship, which saw service during the 2003 Iraq War and was also deployed to Libya, has also seen service closer to home, most notably when it was used to ferry aircraft passengers stranded in France by the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption back across the Channel.

Although every Royal Navy warship has a Lady Sponsor, Ocean is the only one sponsored by the Queen, whose role includes being kept informed of its progress and making regular visits. 

Inspecting the troops: The Queen was welcomed to Devonport with a 21-gun royal salute

Main event: After a welcome from Vice Admiral Jones, the Queen presided over the re-dedication ceremony

Enjoying the sunshine: Her Majesty appeared to be enjoying the beautiful spring sunshine in Devon

What eclipse? The Queen arrived shortly after the partial solar eclipse took place

Sponsor: The Queen is Ocean's Lady Sponsor and is kept up-to-date with the ship's activities

Flagship: 2015 will see Ocean take on the duties of the Royal Navy's flagship, taking over from HMS Bullwark

On patrol: Ocean was famously deployed to Greenwich in 2012 to provide extra security during the Olympics
