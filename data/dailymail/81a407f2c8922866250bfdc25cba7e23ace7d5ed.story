A 29-year-old single mother was tragically killed in a car crash just 500 feet from where she watched her twin sister die in a hit and run 18 years ago. 

Sarah Sanaghan died early Thursday morning when she pulled out in front of a semi-tanker going south on an expressway near Crete, Indiana.

The truck hit the passenger side of Sanaghan's Chevrolet Cruze around 5:40am and the nurse was later pronounced dead at a hospital in Dyer from blunt force trauma to the head.

Double the tragedy: 29-year-old Sarah Sanaghan 
died early Thursday morning in a car crash with a semi-tanker just 500 
feet from where she watched her twin sister die in a hit-and-run 
accident in 1996

The scene of the fatal crash was just
 steps away from where Sanaghan's twin sister Cari and two friends died 
in a hit-and-run after sneaking out of a sleepover on May 26, 1996.

'We do not want to relive this again,' Sanaghan's stepmother Elizabeth Sanaghan told the Chicago Tribune on Friday.

The
 whole group was staying at the twins' house that night when they snuck 
out to go to a boyfriend's house just before midnight.

11-year-old Cari and friends 
Courtney Lauer, 11, and Sheena Acres, 12, were struck by one of the Sanaghan's neighbors who fled the scene.

Sanaghan
 was with the group but escaped getting hit when the bike of a 
13-year-old boy they were walking with struck her and pushed her out of 
the way.

The boy was also injured in the hit-and-run, and was treated for broken bones at the hospital.

Mother Cynthia Sanaghan thought the girls had finally gone to sleep when she heard Sarah cry: 'Mommy, help me!'

'I heard Sarah yelling, "Oh, my God, they're in a ditch,"' Cynthia told the Tribune in 1996.

She ran out to pick-up one of the three bodies, but didn't recognize who it was at first since her face was obscured by matted hair and blood

'I ran down to the road and picked up the first girl I saw. I didn't even know who it was. It turned out to be Cari.'

Collision: The single mom and nurse died at this intersection when she pulled out in front of a semi-tanker which hit the passenger side of her Chevrolet. She was pronounced dead at the hospital from blunt force trauma to the head

The mother then had an older family friend who was staying over call 911 while she went on to performing CPR on Sheena.

'And then I started CPR on Cari, but she was just too broken. The coroner said they were hit so hard they didn't feel anything,' Cynthia said.

The
 driver of the car was identified a few days after the deadly accident 
as Richard Devon, a man who lived just three doors down from the 
Sanaghans.

'My
 name is Sarah Sanaghan. I want to thank all the people who paid 
attention and cared. This man killed my sister and my best friends, and 
they're dead and they're never coming back, and he deserves a little 
more than what he got,' Sanaghan said in 1998 when Devon was convicted.

Devon
 served just one year of his 2 1/2 year sentence after getting let out 
early for good behavior - something the family was not happy about at 
the time.

'We're all very upset by this,' a 14-year-old Sanaghan told the Tribune in December 1998.

But
 the family did bring some good from the tragedy of Cari's death. They 
helped champion new legislation that made leaving the scene of an 
accident where there's been an injury or death punishable by 3 to 14 
years in prison. 

Losing
 her twin left Sarah forever changed. When Cari's possessions were taken
 out of the bedroom they shared following the accident, Sarah still 
couldn't bare to live in the same room and moved to the attic.

'We're moving on, but it's different. There's no little girl in (Sarah) anymore,' Cynthia told the Tribune in 1996. 'Sheena (Acres) was Sarah's best friend, and she doesn't have another one. She's floating.'

Gone: Sanaghan leaves behind an 11-year-old son named Elijah

Friends say that the nightmare of that day continued to haunt Sanaghan into adulthood.

'Even though it's been 18 years of whatever, it was like it was yesterday to her,' fiend Jen Warta told NWITimes.com.

But despite her dark past, Sanaghan was described as a mostly positive person.

'She was the most positive energy I ever met in my life,' friend Cori Bulatovich said.

Bulatovich
 got sushi with Sanaghan and her 11-year-old son Elijah the night before
 the fatal crash and said the young mom was in high spirits over a new 
job opportunity.

'We were laughing,' recalled Bulatovich, 36. 'Elijah was cracking jokes. We were talking about good times.'

Warta says Elijah was Sanaghan's 'heart and soul'.

Friends and family of Sanaghan started an online campaign to raise money for a memorial fund. The goal was $1,000 - but they had raised over $7,000 as of early Monday.
