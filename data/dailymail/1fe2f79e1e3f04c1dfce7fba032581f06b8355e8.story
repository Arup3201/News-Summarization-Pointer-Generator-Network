Locking the gates to the public park must have seemed the best way to prevent travellers getting in and setting up an illegal camp.

But such common sense is no match for the diktats of health and safety – even if it is the travellers’ own determined efforts to get in that are creating the risk.

So for the second time in six months the gates to Wild Park, on the outskirts of Brighton, were unlocked and a convoy of caravans admitted to the conservation area.

It was decided that the travellers’ 
attempts to get round the locked gate – including mounting the pavement 
and driving over mounds built with the specific purpose of keeping them 
out – was putting them at risk of injury.

Last August: A 30-strong convoy of caravans turned up and officials unlocked the vehicle access gate because they were concerned the travellers might hurt themselves as they tried to get in to the park

In
 was only in August last  year that the gate to Wild Park was unlocked 
because of similar  fears that the travellers might hurt themselves or 
other road users by trying to get in.

And,
 like last time, the police cannot get involved because the travellers 
were let on to the park. So once again the taxpayer faces a costly civil
 court action to get them off the site – and an expensive clean-up after
 they have moved on.

Yesterday
 a spokesman for Green Party-led Brighton and Hove City Council said: 
‘The gate was opened on the agreement of council officers and police 
officers as a measure to avoid danger to road users.

‘This
 has been done before and all enforcement options are being kept under 
review.’ It means local residents will once again be put off using the 
park, Brighton and Hove’s largest local nature reserve.

Last
 year the unofficial camp swelled to 50 caravans, which stayed for up to
 a fortnight before they could be evicted. A repeat performance of the 
farcical situation began when travellers attempted to get in five days 
ago.

Residents then watched in horror as officials opened the gates to let the convoy of 19 caravans in at 6pm on Thursday.

If
 the gates had remained locked, any travellers could have been evicted 
immediately because they would have been committing an offence under 
Section 61 of the Criminal Justice and Public  Order Act.

The
 latest arrivals in the park are a mixture of Irish travellers and 
English gipsies, the council says, some of whom arrived after being 
evicted from a car park at a  sports centre.

Figures
 show that town halls were left with a £1.2 million bill last year for 
dealing with travellers who  illegally pitch their caravans on 
council-owned land.

The 
bill, which has to be met through council tax payments, included 
clearing up hazardous waste dumped by the travellers, providing security
 guards around their illegal camps and even putting in portable toilets 
for them.

In total, the bill
 came to around £400,000 each for legal costs, the clean-up and the 
expenses to secure the site after the travellers had been evicted.

The
 results from a Freedom of Information survey revealed the council that 
last year faced the biggest bills for dealing with illegal travellers 
was Leeds (£211,153) with Brighton and Hove in second place (£194,147).

Jonathan
 Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Cleaning up after illegal 
sites costs taxpayers a fortune as does the policing of sites so it’s 
vital a long term and sustainable solution is found.

‘Residents
 are often left fuming when they have to clean up after anti-social 
behaviour while some are allowed to openly flout the law.

‘The
 best solution is to ensure legal pitches are available to  travellers, 
thereby allowing the police to take a tougher line on those camping 
illegally.’
