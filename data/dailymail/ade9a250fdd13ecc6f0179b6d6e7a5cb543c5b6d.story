A Minnesota appellate court upheld the conviction of a domestic violence victim who was charged with a DWI after fleeing her husband while drunk.

Jennifer Marie Axelberg appealed her conviction on the grounds that she was fleeing for her life from her abusive husband, but the Minnesota Court of Appeals refused such a 'necessity defense' on Monday, saying Axelberg was risking her own injury and that of others by driving while intoxicated, according to KMSP-TV.

Axelberg was charged for driving while intoxicated and her license was revoked after she drove with a .18 blood alcohol level to flee her husband who had just hit her twice in the head.

Defense: Jennifer Marie Axelberg, left, said she drove while intoxicated because she was afraid her husband Jason Axelberg, right, was going to hit her again

Shattered: Jason Axelberg, left, was arrested after hitting his wife Jennifer Marie Axelberg and smashing her car's windshield, right, when she tried to flee for her life

The 'necessity defense' is often applied in cases where victims injure their attackers or homeowners hurt intruders. To successfully use such a defense, Axelberg had to prove she had no option but to break the law and that she would have been injured if she didn't drive drunk.

In May 2011, she and and her husband Jason Axelberg were on vacation when they got into a spat after drinking. They were at their family cabin near Mora, Minn., when Mr Axelberg pushed his wife in the chest and hit her head twice.

Fearing more abuse, Axelberg got into the car and locked the doors. Her husband climbed onto her car and smashed her windshield. Thinking he might get in the car and hurt her, Axelberg drove awayâ€”even though she was drunk.

Someone called police and Mr Axelberg was arrested for domestic assault and disorderly conduct. He pleaded guilty to both charges later.

But Axelberg was also arrested and her license was revoked. While Axelberg's license has since been reinstated, she's been trying to clear her record 'out of principle', KMSP-TV reported.

The district court refused the necessity defense and the Minnesota Court of Appeals upheld the district court's decision on Monday.

In the majority opinion of the court, Judge Randolph W Peterson did acknowledge Axelberg was threatened with physical harm, but he concludes she only created more risk to herself and others by driving intoxicated.

'Appellant was threatened with physical injury by her husband,' Peterson said. 'But, by driving while impaired, appellant created the very risk of physical injury to herself and to other highway users that the implied-consent statute is intended to prevent.'

In a dissenting opinion, Judge Margaret H Chutich wrote that 'Axelberg reasonably feared for her safety'.

'A review of the district court record suggests that Axelberg had "no legal alternative to breaking the law," "the harm to be prevented [was] imminent," and "a direct, causal connection [existed] between breaking the law and preventing the harm,"' Chutich wrote. '...I would therefore reverse the district court's decision and remand for further findings on whether the facts of Axelberg's case meet the demanding requirements of the necessity defense.'

Axelberg's attorney, Ryan M Pacyga, is planning on filing an appeal with the state Supreme Court.

Axelberg and her husband have since reconciled and are both sober. She told City Pages last summer that she still thinks she made the right decision.

'I'm alive today,' she said.

Mr Axelberg also told City Page that if she didn't drive away, 'probably would've hit her more'.
