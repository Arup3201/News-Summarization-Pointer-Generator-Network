It would be difficult for any new parents to be better prepared for parenthood than the Cambridges.

The Duke and Duchess are surrounded by friends and family brimming with knowledge in the latest trends in parenting including baby gurus, breast feeding advocates and hypnosis experts, as well as eager grandparents ready to impart a lifetime of experience.

The young couple have already revealed that they will not be employing a full-time nanny and that Kate will eventually be a part-time working mother, breaking with royal tradition. William has also indicated that he wants to be a hands-on father, starting with driving his wife and new son home from the hospital on Tuesday evening.

It expected that the new parents will employ a modern, more 'middle-class' parenting style, drawing on advice and inspiration from their many different groups of friends, including:

Long-time Royal family friend Rose van Cutsem and business partner Maggie Bolger recently set up a private members club for toddlers, Maggie & Rose, conveniently just a stone's throw from Kensington Palace.

The perfect spot for baby Cambridge, the exclusive club accepts day-old members and offers organic gardening and cooking lessons, flamenco dancing, Jackson Pollock inspired art classes, a soft-play area, playroom and cafe.

It costs around £585 per year per family, with the option of paying on a termly basis.

‘I set up Maggie & Rose because I didn’t feel like there was anywhere nice to go with my children when they were little,’ says co-founder and mother-of-four Maggie Bolger, 35.

‘As soon as you have a baby it’s like you’re not allowed to go anywhere nice; nice places don’t really want you because they see buggies and toddlers as a hassle.’

Maggie & Rose's mothers and nannies 'all seem to know one another and staff greet all adults and children by name'. An example art class involves making a dragon out of card and glitter and lollipop sticks. 

‘We have a lot of clients who are working mothers with a part or full-time nanny,’ says Maggie. ‘They want to know that they’ve got somewhere friendly and stimulating to go. We provide support to mothers, especially in the early years, which can be so isolating.’

Co-founder of Maggie & Rose, Rose van Cutsem's family are close with the Prince of Wales (left) and Beverley Turner, Marina Fogle's Bump Class team member, says Kate should breastfeed (right)

'As
if there wasn’t enough pressure on her already, what we really need is 
The Duchess of Cambridge to get her Royal orbs out to feed our future 
monarch,' wrote Beverley Turner, another FOC, in a piece for the Telegraph last month.

'And to be applauded - not seethed at - for doing so.'

There is a reason Kate might be more willing to take on Beverley's advice.

She's
part of a trendy advice team clued up on all things births, 
breastfeeding and parenting for new mothers set up by Marina Fogle - a 
close friend of the Cambridges.

'We need women with power and 
influence to get their milky bosoms out and feed smiling in paparazzi 
pictures. Celebrity is depressingly powerful in dictating trends,' she writes.

The number of new mothers breastfeeding is falling in England for the first time in almost a decade - 5,700 fewer women are opting for it this year and Beverley wants the influential Duchess to set an example and reignite the trend.

FOC Marina Fogle, the wife of explorer Ben Fogle, is co-founder of high end ante-natal course the Bump Class.

The couple were guests at the Catherine and William's wedding and it is rumoured that Kate partook in private sessions of the eight-course programme while pregnant with her son.

Sessions include all aspects of post-natal care for yummy mummies (including stylist recommendations) and advice on breastfeeding. Post birth a consultant from the Bump Class is available via Skype or a personal visit to offer breastfeeding help.

As Kate and William have chosen not to 
employ a nanny, grandparents Charles and Camilla and the Middletons will
play a key role in helping out with their little son.

While the third in line to the throne is the first grandchild for Carole, for Camilla it is her sixth.

In
an indication of the key role the Middletons will play in the 
upbringing of the heir to the throne, they were the very first members 
of the family to meet the Duke and Duchess's new son, almost 23 hours 
after the infant was born.

Sophie Wessex said she feels 'ridiculously happy' about the birth.

'It is a wonderful event. I'm hoping in the next few days to catch up with them,' she said.

'I have sent messages but haven't visited. Having had babies myself I know you really want to close down the hatches and be with your immediate family for the first few days and weeks. 

'I never expected to feel quite this happy but I've had a big smile on my face every since the news broke. '

The two sets of grandparents arrived at 
St Mary's to visit the newborn yesterday just moments before the Duke 
and Duchess were to leave the hospital for their journey back to 
Kensington Palace.

The new parents are set to spend two weeks at the Palace while William enjoys his two weeks of paternity leave.

Then, it is thought that Kate will travel to Bucklebury to the mansion Carole and Michael bought earlier this year where she will spend the next four weeks under the wing of the Middleton before the couple are likely to join the Queen in Balmoral where she will be for the summer.

A key indicator of the informal childhood the Royal baby will have is the tea party at Clarence House last month.

The Duchess of Cornwall's daughter 
Laura Lopes had invited friends and their children over after Trooping 
the Colour last month.

According
to a family friend by the end of the afternoon the children were 'so 
scruffy it was hilarious. They looked like urchins. It was very sweet.'

'Passers-by
may have been forgiven for thinking that the home of the prince of 
Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall had been invaded by a rampaging mob...
but those responsible for the screaming and roaring were mostly under 
5s,' reported the Times.

The third in line to the throne will enjoy an outdoorsy and hands-on upbringing, with a new air of informality that his grandfather did not experience, one that breaks the mould.

The Prince of Wales has been waiting for this day for a very long time as he has been enjoying time with his wife's five grandchildren.

Now a grandfather for the first time he is sure to relish every moment with the new baby.
