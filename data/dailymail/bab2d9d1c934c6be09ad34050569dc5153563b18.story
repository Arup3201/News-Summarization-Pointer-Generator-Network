Parents are risking their children’s development by putting their entire families on restrictive diets, a new study has claimed.

The Healthy Diet Study 2014, by Galaxy Research, has exposed the dangers of low carbohydrate and bread diets, which can restrict nutrients and vitamins needed for ideal psychological development.

The study found that 82 per cent of parents give their children the same meals when they are on diets themselves, largely because it was more convenient than making separate meals.

The research found that a further 45 per cent of these parents limited the bread their children ate, and 17 per cent cut carbs from their children’s diet altogether.

Popular diets such as paleo and clean-eating have seen a marked drop in carbohydrate intake among Australians, which can lead to a deficient intake of fibre, grains and protein.

Sydney based paediatric dietician Hanan Salah told Daily Mail Australia she condemns restrictive low carbohydrate diets for children.

‘There are often overweight or obese parents who try to cut out food groups. In doing so, they put their children on these restrictive diets,’ she said.

‘Carbohydrates are essential to the brain function of children at school, as well as maintainingenergy levels. Carbohydrates also release serotonin, so restricting this can result in a drop in mood, and even the potential for depression in the long term.’

Ms Salah said that while the diets can lead to weight loss in overweight children, they will miss out on essential nutrients such as fibre and other vitamins.

She recommends parents make smarter choices with regards to the portion and quality of food.

‘Rather than cutting out food groups, we recommend reducing portions for overweight families. Don’t worry about spending hours cooking complex meals. Opt for low GI carbohydrates such as brown rice and dark breads,' she said.

‘Ultimately carbohydrates are essential for children to thrive and be happy.’
