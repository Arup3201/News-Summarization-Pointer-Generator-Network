Settlement: Chicago woman Dana Holmes, pictured, has been awarded a $355,000 settlement after she was stripped naked by four sheriff's deputies

A Chicago woman has been awarded a $355,000 settlement after she was stripped naked by four sheriff's deputies and then left in a cell following a DUI arrest.

Jailhouse video captured the rough handling of Coal City woman, Dana Holmes, in May last year.

She claims the sheriff's deputies violated her civil rights and caused her emotional harm by stripping her naked without legal justification.

The deputies argued that Holmes was 
being uncooperative, but LaSalle County authorities decided to settle, 
announcing the move Tuesday morning.

Holmes
 will receive $125,000 and attorney Terry Ekl will get $100,000 in legal
 fees, according to court documents, cited by the Chicago Tribune.

Four people who said they received similar treatment at the jail will each receive $30,000 and a fifth person will get $10,000.

Holmes, who blew around three times the 
legal blood alcohol limit when she was stopped, pleaded guilty and 
received court supervision following that charge.

In the video, four sheriff's deputies carry the 32-year-old into a LaSalle County jail cell.

Cell: Holmes was thrown in a cell because she was being 'uncooperative,' police said 

The
 three men and one woman put her face down on the floor and proceed to 
strip off her clothes the take them away, leaving her alone and naked in 
the cell.

A few minutes later, they throw blankets inside.

'I was terrified. I felt helpless. I was scared and I lay there crying... I just prayed,' Holmes told ABC 7 at the time.

The county's lawyer said a new strip search policy was in the process of being implemented to prevent this happening again.

DUI: The trouble began when Holmes, pictured, was pulled over for being drunk behind the wheel

Angry: Back at he jailhouse, she was being searched against a wall, left, when cops suddenly threw her to the floor, right

Naked: After stripping her in the cell, she was left alone naked with just a blanket

In future, a strip search will require detailed documentation.

'The
 county and department believe it’s in everybody's best interest to 
focus on policies and protocols moving forward, rather than spending 
time and money fighting over who was right and wrong,' James Sotos told 
the Tribune.

He added that the case highlighted a gap in jail policies and training protocols in the county and across Illinois.
