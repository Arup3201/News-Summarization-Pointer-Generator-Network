Australia's terror alert will remain at medium despite the United Kingdom increasing its assessment of risk from substantial to severe, the second-highest level.

The alert level is regularly reviewed by authorities and would be increased to high 'if it were deemed that a terrorist attack is likely to occur,' Attorney-General George Brandis said in a statement on Saturday.

Senator Brandis said the government was seriously concerned that about 60 Australians were fighting in Syria and Iraq and another 100 were believed to be involved.

Australia's terror alert will remain at medium despite the United Kingdom increasing its assessment of risk from substantial to severe on Friday  

'We remain in close contact with the United Kingdom and other partners about the threat from terrorist groups active in Syria and Iraq, and from returning foreign fighters,' he said.

The UK's terror level was on Friday boosted to severe but Home Secretary Theresa May said there wasn't any specific threat.

'This move by the United Kingdom indicates the significance of the threat posed by the Islamic State and other terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq,' Senator Brandis said.

The medium terror alert means that a terrorist attack could occur.

It's still safe to travel to the UK, Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said.

'So long as Australian people abide by any warnings or suggestions they have in place, they should be able to travel there quite safely,' he said.

'We will continue to monitor the situation and when there is a need to make a change we will. But at this stage we will take the advice and act when or if it becomes necessary.'

British Prime Minister David Cameron said ISIS was more dangerous than the Taliban and al Qaeda because it was trying to set up its own 'terrorist state'

Meanwhile British Prime Minister David Cameron, yesterday announced an increase of armed police to patrol Britain's streets to counter the threat posed by fanatics returning from Iraq and Syria.

Critical - an attack is expected imminently

Severe - an attack is highly likely

Substantial - an attack is a strong possibility

Moderate - an attack is possible but not likely

Low - an attack is unlikely

He said that the return of hundreds of murderous extremists posed a greater threat to the country's security than Al Qaeda or the IRA ever did.

The Home Secretary said the intelligence services now believe a terror attack in Britain is ‘highly likely’, although she stressed there was no information about any specific plot.

‘The increase in the threat level is related to developments in Syria and Iraq where terrorist groups are planning attacks against the West,’ Theresa May said. ‘Some of those plots are likely to involve foreign fighters who have travelled there from the UK and Europe to take part in those conflicts.’

British intelligence officers believe at least 500 British citizens have travelled to Syria and Iraq to wage jihad, of which about half have returned to this country.
