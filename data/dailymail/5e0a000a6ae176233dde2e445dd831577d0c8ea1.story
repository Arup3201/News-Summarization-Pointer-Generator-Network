A California couple are praying their baby boy survives after they asked doctors to save him when he was born on Tuesday, four months early, weighing only 14 ounces.

Little Decklen was born at 22-weeks after mom, Carrie Maize, suffered an umbilical cord prolapse and both she and dad, James Maize, decided to go through with an emergency C-section.

The courageous couple rushed to St. Mary Medical Center in Apple Valley and are desperate to give their son every chance at life because their daughter Serenity died last year after also being born at 22-weeks.

'It was a choice between me and my wife if we wanted to try to save him or not,' James said to CBS 2.

'We decided that we wanted to try to save him, so they rushed her back for a C-section.'

Measuring only 10-inches from toe to head, Decklen weighs less than a pint of milk and is currently under 24-hour observation in the neo-natal intensive care unit.

'If he’s a fighter, you know, we want him to fight and make his own decisions,' Maize said.

'It’s rough…just being able to sit there at his bedside and just pretty much whisper.'

Maize is a serving in the Army at the moment and is stationed in Virginia.

He rushed home in time to make the decision with his wife after she suffered her medical emergency.

'If a baby can be saved, if you have a doctor that is willing to do what he has to do…and we have a great doctor, you know, and he’s doing everything he possibly can for our son,' Maize said.

Carrie, who already has two children with James, posted a picture to Facebook of Decklen and described him as 'amazing' and 'strong'.

Adding that he looks 'just like his daddy', Carrie said that so far he is stable and doing well as he is looked after by the medical team at St. Mary's.

So sad: Carrie with her baby daughter who did not survive after coming into the world stillborn at 22-weeks in August last year

Angel: Carrie and Serenity - the baby girl was stillborn last year despite the best efforts of the doctors

Just last month Carrie posted a selfie picture to Facebook in which she was proudly showing off her baby bump before her medical emergency.

And then last year in August, Carrie and James went through the hearbreak of their baby daughter Serenity being born at 22-weeks and sadly passing away.

One amazing picture posted by mom onto Facebook shows her daughter's delicate tiny hand, no bigger than the last joint on her middle finger, resting.

Able to spend a little while with her child, Carrie wrote on Facebook that 'I only got to hold her teeny little hand for a short time but nothing will ever compare.'

Serenity 
was stillborn and in the most touching picture posted by Carrie, the 
distraught mother holds her child wrapped up in blankets.

The
 picture is captioned with the message, 'The day our sweet little angel 
was born . The hardest day of my entire life. She is so perfect.'

Carrie is due to go home on Thursday and will spend the next few months visiting Decklen in the neonatal intensive care unit.

Children born at 22-24 weeks generally weigh only a maximum of one pound.

The smallest premature baby ever born weighed in at 8 1/2 ounces.
