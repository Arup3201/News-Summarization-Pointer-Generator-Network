Loot Skywalker: A bidder paid a record-breaking £7,000 for a Star Wars collectable - an original 1980 Palitoy Empire Strikes Back medical droid

The force was strong in one bidder when they paid a record-breaking £7,000 for a Star Wars collectable.

Lot 1035, an original 1980 Palitoy Empire Strikes Back medical droid, was originally valued at £50 to £70.

But as the bids started rolling in at Vectis Auctions, Thornaby, it sold to an unnamed bidder for £7,000 - a world record for the model at 100 times the asking price.

Vectis Auctions spokeswoman Louise Harker said: 'When we first received the items we didn't expect them to do as well as they did.

'The Star Wars items made up the the first 50 lots and it just went through the roof.

'The room was pretty full, a couple of people were bidding it out against each other, the same person bought quite a few of the big lots.'

Original Star Wars toys have been known to fetch high prices and a number of factors can push the price higher still.

Ms Harker said: 'We are seeing that the TV and film related items, such as Star Wars are becoming increasingly popular.

'The condition of the lots is a key factor in gaining prices such as these, the un-punched card, the condition of the card itself, the bubble which the figure is contained within and of course the all-important factory seal.

'This figure is not one I've ever heard of, sometimes all it takes is for two collectors to be missing one figure from their collection to push up the value.'

An Empire Strikes Back Imperial Commander figure at the same auction also broke a world record for its model when it fetched £3,000 while a Darth Vader action figure sold for £2,520.

The sale of the items left one person in particular with an unlikely windfall.

Ms Harker said: 'I have spoken to the vendor who was extremely shocked. These items all came from the same collection, the vendor had no preconceptions about what they would fetch and was delighted with the pre-sale estimates given.

'He was pleasantly surprised by the final price realised for his items.'

Currently listed on eBay there is a lot with a buy it now price of £120 titled Star Wars 1980 Vintage MOC ESB FX-7 Medical Droid.

Also on eBay, in 2012 a lot that included all 1,950 loose figures was sold for $11,500.

In the film, FX-7 was stationed in the Rebels' secret Echo Base on the ice planet of Hoth. He assisted both human and droid medics in the Echo Base medical lab.

The droid's ability to use its twenty retractable manipulator arms simultaneously proved useful to an understaffed medical bay. After the loss of Yavin Base, the Alliance used any outmoded equipment they could find.

This droid was certainly classed as outmoded but proved invaluable for its sophisticated medical, diagnostic and procedural programming.

Although this droid was capable of speech, its speech synthesizer card was missing.

FX-7 assisted 2-1B on Hoth after Luke Skywalker was attacked by a wampa. The droids built up a good rapport with one another, and had worked together for more than a year.

Despite this, 2-1B would often state his superiority over his medical assistant, due to his egotistical droid personality.

FX-7 and 2-1B escaped Hoth aboard the GR-75 medium transport Bright Hope, the last transport to leave the planet.

After the bounty hunters 4-LOM and Zuckuss rescued the passengers of the Bright Hope, including the two medical droids, FX-7 was reassigned to the EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate Redemption.
