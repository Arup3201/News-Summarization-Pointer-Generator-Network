Jewish students at New York University have been targeted by a pro-Palestinian group that reportedly slipped 'eviction' notices under the doors of several Jewish students in one of the university's Greenwich Village residents halls last week.

'If you do not vacate the premise by midnight on 25 April, 2014 we 
reserve the right to destroy all remaining belongings. We cannot be held
 responsible for property or persons remaining inside the premises,' the fake eviction slips read.

The NYU student group Students for Justice in Palestine have taken credit for notices, which came with a disclaimer at the bottom stating, 'this is not an eviction notice,' and explaining that the notices were meant to draw attention to the group's claim that the Israeli government issues similar eviction notices to Palestinians living in Israel.

Phony: These phony eviction notices were slid under the doors of several of NYU's Jewish students

NYU's Palladium residence hall on 14th Street in Manhattan reportedly was targeted because of its large Jewish population

The pro-Palestinian group targeted the NYU resident housing facility Palladium, on East 14th Street in Manhattan, because it is believed to house a lot of NYU's Jewish students, the Times of Israel reports - according to the paper, the building even has elevators that operate without buttons for students acknowledging the Sabbath.

A spokesman for NYU says the prank crossed a line.

'It is disappointingly inconsistent with standards we expect to prevail 
in a scholarly community,' spokesman John Beckman told the New York Post. 'Our Residence Life and Housing
 Office will be communicating with the students in the dorm, looking 
into the matter, and following up appropriately.'

According to Beckman, it's unclear why the group targeted the Palladium dorms.

'However, were it to be the case that the fliering was done there 
because it was perceived to be a dorm with a higher proportion of Jewish
 students, that would be troubling, dismaying and a matter of deep 
concern for our community,' Beckman said.

Students for Justice for Palestine took credit for the fliers in a blog post on its NYU website.

'NYU SJP's eviction action created more dialogue than ever before,' the headline of a blog post on the site reads.

Students say they we troubled by the phony eviction notices.

'Dialogue': The students seem to thing their stunt was a success and has 'created...dialogue'

'We thought we were getting evicted. We were panicking a little bit,' sophomore Gabrielle Doria, 20, told the paper.

Similar pranks, the paper reports, have recently happened at other universities, including Rutgers, Michigan and Northwestern.
