The heartwarming story of how a Chili's server 'fixed' an autistic child's 'broken' burger has attracted more than half a million Likes on Facebook.

Arianna Hill, aged seven, from Midvale, Utah, loves cheeseburgers, but couldn't eat one at her local restaurant chain on Sunday because it came chopped in half.

When her older sister Anna MacLean asked what was wrong, the youngster calmly replied: 'Itâ€™s broken. I need another one that's fixed.'

Heartwarming story: Arianna Hill, aged seven, who suffers from autism, couldn't eat a cheeseburger because it came chopped in half and appeared 'broken' but she was over joyed when a new 'fixed' one was served

Mrs MacLean, 25, explained the situation to a waitress 
and said she was willing to pay for a new meal, but staff happily served up a whole burger and bun free of charge.

She said that the act of kindness made a real difference to her day and she was 'touched' by the experience.

When the new burger arrived, a delighted Arianna made staff laugh, as she sat showering it with kisses.

Mrs MacLean captured the  'burger kiss' moment on camera and posted a photograph on Chili's official Facebook page with a caption detailing the chain of events.

'I was so touched by this experience.
 Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants
 when their child with autism is being disruptive,' she wrote.

The image currently has 608,178 Likes and 33,074 comments on Facebook, with many saying how they can relate to the story.

''I was so touched by this experience... Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants when their child with autism is being disruptive'

One revealed: 'This story is touching because I have an autistic nephew who reacts the same way.'

And another praised the restaurant staff for being so understanding and taking care of Arianna's request.

'Nice to see a restaurant staff who could react so positively to your daughter's 'broken' cheeseburger,' they wrote.

'My daughter had similar issues when she was younger and it was not easy to avoid meltdowns sometimes.'

Recalling
 the incident, Mrs MacLean said that when they arrived at the Chili's diner Arianna ordered her favorite meal - cheeseburger with pickles, french fries, 
and chocolate milk.

But when the food arrived she wondered why the cheeseburger was left untouched.

Arianna explained that she didn't want to eat the meat and cheese stack because it was 'broken'.

Mrs MacLean soon realized that she was referring to the fact it was cut in two. 

'Being a child with autism, she has to have certain things in a particular order at all times,' Mrs MacLean describes on Facebook.

I've been with Chili's for 13 years and I've never been as proud as I am today'

'One slight change in her routine can change the course of the day instantly.'

She told ABC News that Arianna's verbal skills 'arenâ€™t the best' but she can communicate on a basic level.

Lauren Wells and Brad Cattermole - the sever and manager at Chili's who were shifting the day Arianna and Mrs MacLean visited - were quick to remedy the situation.

Ms Wells happily took away the 'broken' burger and presented Arianna with a 'fixed' one, while Ms Cattermole offered the seven-year-old a heartfelt apology and an extra side of fries.

Harrison Dixson, Chili's general manager ,said that he's received dozens of calls from people and authorities thanking him for the way his staff handled the situation.

'I can't tell you how proud I am of those two. I've been with this company for 13 years and I've never been as proud as I am today,' Mr Dixson said.
