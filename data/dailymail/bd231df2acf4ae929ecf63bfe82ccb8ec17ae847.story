When the sun comes out, so do the daredevils.

Instead of relaxing in the first hot spell of the summer, these reckless youngsters were risking their lives by throwing themselves into water from  dizzying heights.

Chillingly, they were leaping from the same 30ft bridge that claimed the life of a young man just 12 months ago.

Darrell Teal, 22, died last July after jumping from Devil’s Bridge in Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria.

He was indulging in the growing craze of ‘tombstoning’ – named after its potentially fatal consequences as well as the upright position in which jumpers enter the water.

Despite many fatalities over the years, the latest last July, jumpers see the thrill as an exciting way to cool off during the hot summer weather, plunging 30ft from the historic bridge 

The current heatwave is attracting dare devil 'Tombstoners' defying warning signs not to jump from Devils Bridge in Kirkby Lonsdale

The hottest parts of the country yesterday were Bournemouth and Heathrow, which at 29.7C (85.5F) were warmer than Ibiza and Istanbul. And the Met Office has said there is a chance that today could be even hotter still

Signs warning of prosecution by police
did not deter a group from risking the same fate on the River Lune on 
Sunday as temperatures nudged close to 30C (86F).

The 14th century Lake District bridge 
is a magnet for youngsters, despite local councillors seeking to pass a 
bylaw against jumping following several injuries.

Emergency services are now warning of 
the dangers of playing near water as forecasters predict blazing hot 
weather for the rest of the week. The Met Office has said temperatures 
could exceed 30C, meaning the hottest day of the year is still to come.

The hot weather is set to continue throughout the week with forecasters preparing the country for five more days of sunshine. But the balmy conditions have sparked an outbreak of young people risking their lives by embarking on a craze called 'tombstoning' - completely naked

The teenagers risked their lives by leaping 65ft into the sea as the summer heatwave sparks a new epidemic of deadly 'tombstoning'. The fast-growing craze has killed at least 20 people nationwide and has seriously injured or paralysed 60 in the last nine years

They have dubbed the new craze 'moonstoning' because it is a mix of both tombstoning and skinny dipping

The young men are seemingly oblivious to the danger of the craze, however, as they smile and make their way back up to the harbour wall to jump again

And they were cheered on by a crowd of onlookers, who watched as the young men threw themselves off the historic wall

Tombstoning has also broken out in 
Plymouth, Devon, where coastguards issued what is fast becoming an 
annual warning against the activity. Several youths were spotted leaping
65ft off a spot  known as Dead Man’s Cove – yards from where a teenager
was left paralysed in 2010.

Some jumped naked, in a variation of the stunt being dubbed ‘moonstoning’.

A coastguard spokesman warned: ‘It is 
extremely dangerous and when it goes wrong it can have devastating 
results. We would warn anyone against attempting these kind of stunts.’

Following a weekend in which many 
Britons headed to the beach, a teenage girl was feared drowned yesterday
after getting into difficulty in the sea at a resort.

A Coastguard spokesman warned teenagers against tombstoning and described it as 'extremely dangerous'

Some of the young people had been seen swilling from cans before they jumped from the harbour wall

The coastguard has issued a warning to the jumpers saying: 'You get undertows and people get hurt, particularly if there is a swell running. People need to be aware of the dangers associated with tombstoning'

Some of the fearless youngsters kept their trainers and shorts on as they leapt into the water

Some of the young men opted to keep their clothes on for the plunge - but it didn't make it any less dangerous

Hollie McClymont, 14, was last seen more than 24 hours ago off the coast of Whitmore Bay, near Barry Island, South Wales.

Coastguards have been unable to find 
the Glasgow schoolgirl, who was one week into a three-week holiday with 
her friends and family. Her cousin Shannon said: ‘We’re worried sick and
really hope Hollie turns up safe and sound.’ Hollie is thought to have 
been wearing a dress in the water on Sunday afternoon.  

Beachgoers tried to help but it  is 
believed she had been in  trouble for more than an hour before 
coastguards were called. Steve Jones, of HM Coastguard Swansea, said: 
‘We are dumbfounded something wasn’t said to us earlier.’

Yesterday tributes were also paid to a 17-year-old boy who died while swimming in a lake at a disused quarry on Saturday.

Russell O’Neill, from Worcester, 
failed to resurface after going for a dip at Gullet Quarry near Malvern 
in Worcestershire. The promising footballer’s body was later recovered 
by police divers.

His sister Lisa O’Neill wrote on Facebook: ‘The heavens took an angel yday (sic) afternoon.’

Detective Inspector Richard Reese, of 
West Mercia Police, said: ‘With the warm weather upon us and the school 
holidays approaching, we would advise people to think twice about going 
into local rivers, lakes and canals in order to cool off.’

On Sunday, a 45-year-old yachtsman had
to be rescued after dislocating his shoulder when he jumped into the 
water in Newtown Creek, Isle of Wight, to celebrate Andy Murray’s 
Wimbledon win.

And sun reflected from wine bottles 
was said to have caused a fire on the same day at a holiday cottage in 
Porthmadog, North Wales, in which furniture was damaged.
