Another run-in: Controversial politiican Eric Joyce has been arrested for the fourth time in three years

Controversial MP Eric Joyce has been arrested for the fourth time in three years - but insists he was trying to stop a 14-year-old vandal smashing up a shop.

Mr Joyce spoke out about the incident today on his website after a wave of interest was prompted by his arrest being revealed in the House of Commons.

He said he was next to a damaged shop in Camden, north London, just before 10pm on October 17 when he detained the boy he believed responsible - who then told police he had been assaulted by the MP.

Officers had reports of a 'fight' and arrested both the 14-year-old boy, on suspicion of possessing cannabis, and the 54-year-old MP on suspicion of actual bodily harm. They are still investigating.

Mr Joyce wrote on his website: 'I detained a youth in a shop in London. Damage had been done to the store.

'I asked the shopkeeper to call the police, and when officers arrived they arrested the youth and informed me that drugs had been recovered from the scene.

'The officers also informed me that the youth had immediately made a complaint that I had assaulted him by detaining him.

'I was questioned by the police and told that because of my identity the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Metropolitan Police Press Office would be informed of the incident.

'I understand the Metropolitan Police has now made the matter public. I will make no further comment for now, other than to say a) that no alcohol was involved and b) I am not in the habit of summoning the police if I feel that I am in the wrong.'  

The Metropolitan Police revealed the arrest after writing to House speaker John Bercow on October 21, according to an entry in the Commons records. 

A force spokesman said: 'Police in Camden were called to a convenience store in Chalk Farm Parade, Adelaide Road, NW3 at 2142hrs on Friday, 17 October following reports of a fight.

'Upon arrival officers found a man and two teenage boys involved in an altercation.

Scene: The incident happened on this shopping parade next to Chalk Farm tube station in north London

Shop: The MP offered his account of what happened at this shop - and said he was the one who called police

'A 54-year-old man was subsequently arrested on suspicion of ABH.

'A 14-year-old boy [B] was also arrested at the scene for possession of cannabis.

'Both were taken to a central London police station for questioning and have since been bailed to a date in early December pending further enquiries. Neither required medical treatment.

'Police in Camden are investigating and enquiries continue.' 

In March Mr Joyce said he was considering his future as a politician after he admitted calling an Afro-Caribbean baggage handler 'f****** fat and black'.

Destruction: The scene in the shop after the incident

The 54-year-old, who was thrown out of the Labour party after a brawl in a House of Commons bar, was drunk by the time he landed at Edinburgh Airport and hurled abuse at staff on May 19 last year. 

After Mr Joyce was fined £1,500 for the airport incident he insisted he did not have a drinking problem - but said he will 'reflect' on whether he will remain in Westminster.

The MP will not be automatically disqualified from the Commons - that is only possible if MPs are jailed for a year or more.

He had been drinking on an evening flight from Heathrow to the Scottish capital last May, realising later that he left his phone on board, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard today.

He asked airport baggage handlers for help but became abusive when they asked for flight details.

Police officers became involved, but he continued to hurl insults.

Joyce repeatedly called a baggage handler and officers 'fat, f****** w*****s' and goaded officers to 'f****** arrest me'.

He also referred to an officer of Afro-Caribbean origin as 'f****** fat and black'.

Joyce began to 'flail his arms' when one officer attempted to put him in handcuffs, and he continued to resist until he was restrained on the floor.

Sheriff Frank Crowe described his actions as a 'deeply unfortunate, prolonged, drink-fuelled rant'.

CONVICTED: FEBRUARY 2012 

Joyce was convicted of assault after assaulting four people in Strangers Bar on February 22, 2012. He was fined £3,000, handed a curfew and banned from pubs for three months.

ARRESTED: MARCH 2013 

Joyce arrested after reports of another scuffle in a House of Commons bar on March 14, 2013, but police decide there is insufficient evidence to bring any charges.

CONVICTED: MAY 2013 

Joyce was convicted of a breach of the peace and fined £1,500 after hurling abuse at Edinburgh Airport staff on May 19, 2013. Court hears he called police officer of Afro-Caribbean origin 'f****** fat and black'.

'At least you have taken this opportunity to apologise,' the sheriff said.

As well as imposing a fine, the sheriff ordered Joyce to pay £100 compensation to airport staff and £50 to the police officer he racially insulted.

Joyce became an independent MP after he was expelled from the Labour Party following his conviction for assaulting politicians in a House of Commons bar in 2012.

The former Army major was fined £3,000 and banned from pubs for three months following the brawl in the Strangers' Bar.

Joyce's arrival at Westminster in 2000 came shortly after he quit the Army, making claims of snobbery, sexism and racism in the armed forces.

He was elected to Parliament as Labour MP for Falkirk West in a by-election.

He increased his majority in the general elections of 2001 and 2005 when the constituency was renamed Falkirk after constituency changes, and held on by a comfortable margin in 2010.

The selection of his replacement as Labour candidate in Falkirk became emroiled in a major scandal amid claims of vote-rigging.
