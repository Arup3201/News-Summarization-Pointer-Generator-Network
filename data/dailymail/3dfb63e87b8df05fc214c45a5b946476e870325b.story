A second giant rare serpentine oarfish has washed up on a Southern California beach just days after the first creature surfaced from the depths.

The silvery deep-sea monster washed ashore along the coast of Oceanside on Friday afternoon measuring 13 and-a-half feet long.

The discovery came just days after an 18-foot dead oarfish was found in the waters off Catalina Island.

Rare: This snakelike oarfish measuring nearly 14 feet long was found on a beach in Southern California on October 18. Speculation is rife over whether the sightings prelude an earthquake

‘It’s not the typical fish you see on shore,’ said Oceanside Police Officer Mark Bussey, adding the oarfish weighed over 200 pounds.

Oceanside police contacted SeaWorld San Diego, the Scripps Research Institute and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Suzanne Kohin of NOAA Fisheries Serivice came and measured the fish before she took possession of it for research, Bussey told NBC News.

Last week, on October 13, Jasmine Santana, a science instructor for the Catalina Marine Institute, CMI, was snorkeling off Toyon Bay when she discovered the body of the creature on a seabed.

The fish was far too big for Santana to carry alone; it took 15 people to bring the beast to shore.

'We've
 never seen a fish this big,' said Mark Waddington, senior captain of 
the Tole Mour, CIMI's sail training ship. 'The last oarfish we saw was 
three feet long.'

But these two massive fish are puny by 
oarfish standards, according to the NOAA. The oarfish is the largest 
bony fish in the sea and can grow over 50 feet in length.

Because 
oarfish dive more than 3,000 feet deep, sightings of the creatures are 
rare and they are largely unstudied, according to CIMI.

The
 obscure fish apparently died of natural causes. Tissue samples and 
video footage were sent to be studied by biologists at the University of
 California, Santa Barbara.

Science
 instructor Santana spotted something shimmering about 30 feet deep 
while snorkeling during a staff trip in Toyon Bay, about two dozen miles from the mainland.

'She was snorkeling and sees this giant fish at the bottom of the ocean,' Waddington told KTLA.
 'She swims down and grabs it by the tail and swims it to the beach. It 
was awesome. There were people sprinting to go and see this fish.'

Waddington said Santana dragged the fish ashore because she said, 'nobody will believe me'.

After she pulled the carcass by the tail for more than 75 feet, staffers waded in and helped her bring it to shore.

The carcass was on display Tuesday for 5th, 6th, and 7th grade students studying at CIMI.

The
 oarfish, which can grow to more than 50 feet, is a deep-water pelagic 
fish — the longest bony fish in the world, according to CIMI. They are 
likely responsible for the supposed sea serpent legends throughout 
history.

The giant oarfish 
was first discovered in 1772 by Norwegian biologist Peter Ascanius. Its
 formal scientific title is Regalecus glesne, but the fish is also known
 as king of the herring, Pacific oarfish, streamer fish and ribbon-fish.

The longest recorded specimen clocked in at 26 feet, however, the species is believed to grow as long as 50 feet and weigh as much as 600 pounds.

Like
 the equally mysterious giant squid, the oarfish would go on to enchant 
fisherman and sailors and inspire stories of sea monsters.

The fish lives at extreme ocean depths, between 656 feet (0.2 kilometers) and 3,280 feet (1 kilometer) deep.

In 1996, a group of Navy Seals found a 23-foot long oarfish off Coronado, near San Diego, California.

The Catalina fish is currently on ice while the fate of the carcass is decided.

'I
 am pushing to bury it and wait for it to be naturally cleaned so that 
we can then take the skeleton and articulate it and have it on display,'
 said Waddington. 'That is what I hope will happen.
