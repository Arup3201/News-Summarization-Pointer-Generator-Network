Manuel Neuer, Arjen Robben and Cristiano Ronaldo will find out on Thursday afternoon which of them has won UEFA's Best Player in Europe Award. 

The accolade for Europe's top player in the 2013-14 season will be handed out during the draw for the Champions League group stage.

Sportsmail takes a look at the three nominees, and why they are up for the coveted award.

Manuel Neuer

The undisputed best goalkeeper in the world has had quite a year. At club level Bayern Munich swept the board domestically, winning the league and cup double. Of course, Pep Guardiola's side failed to retain their Champions League title - but the Germans were defeated by eventual winners Real Madrid. 

But it is at international level where Neuer excelled. 

His performances in Brazil during Germany's World Cup triumph were quite brilliant, merely underlining his position as the planet's best. 

His 'goalsweeping' style was a feature of Brazil 2014 - in essence acting like a 12th man for his team. He may have left Joachim Low with his heart in his mouth a few times but it was certainly effective.

Arjen Robben

Yes, he is a serial diver - but there's no denying the Dutchman is one of the most effective attacking players in Europe. 

Technically there's not many better, but where he differs from others is that there is almost always an end product - 22 goals from wide is no mean feat. 

His performance against Manchester United in the quarter-final second leg was breathtaking. His performances in the World Cup weren't bad either - particularly in that 5-1 demolition of Spain in the group stages. 

Holland finished third in Brazil, and much of their run was down to Robben. He just needs to cut out the diving!

Cristiano Ronaldo 

There isn't an awful lot more you can say about this guy, who was by far and say the best player in the world last season.

51 goals and 15 assists in a single season tells its own story.

Lionel Messi's injury-hit campaign thrust Ronaldo even more into the limelight and the Portuguese thrived on the attention. 

There wasn't a more potent attacking force than Ronaldo last season - his shirtless celebration following his late penalty in the Champions League final win over local rivals Atletico Madrid was one of the most memorable moments of last season. 

It was a shame, however, that he couldn't carry that form into the World Cup as Portugal crashed out in the group stages. You can't have everything, though.

Unstoppable: Cristiano Ronaldo smashed in 56 goals last season, and helped Real win the Champions League

Fourth time lucky:  Ronaldo has finished third in the award's standings for three years in a row
