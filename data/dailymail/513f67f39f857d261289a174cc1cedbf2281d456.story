Left-handed people have a ‘strikingly higher’ chance of suffering from schizophrenia, research suggests.

A study revealed left-handers accounted for 40 per cent of those with the mental illness.

However, only around 10 per cent of the general population is left-handed.

It is thought that the changes in the brain that make people left-handed may also contribute to schizophrenia.

Famous left-handers include Prince William, Barack Obama, David Cameron, Sir Paul McCartney, Nicole Kidman and Angelina Jolie.

Left-handers are more likely to develop psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, than mood disorders, research suggests (posed by model)

Several US presidents have also written with their left hand, including George Bush Snr and Bill Clinton. Ronald Reagan is said to have been ambidextrous.

Four of the five original designers of the Macintosh computer were left-handed, as were one in four Apollo astronauts.

Researcher Jadon Webb, of Yale University, US, said: ‘Our results show a strikingly higher prevalence of left-handedness among patients presenting with psychotic disorders.’

In contrast, just 10 per cent of those being treated for bipolar disorder or depression were left-handed – a figure much more in line with the rate of left-handedness in the general population.

Nick Craddock, a psychiatrist at Cardiff University, said: ‘This link between handedness and psychosis builds on previous work that seeks to understand how the development and connections within the brain help us better understand schizophrenia. That is an important prelude to developing better treatments.’

The study, published in the journal Sage Open, could also help remove some of the stigma surrounding the illness.

Professor Craddock added: ‘It also serves to highlight that severe psychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia have a very real physical basis in the brain and body and are not just “all in the mind”.’

Despite the link, most schizophrenics are not left-handed – and most people who are left-handed do not develop schizophrenia.

Some argue that the dominance of lefties in the top  is simply a coincidence and the numbers will even out over time.

Others claim left-handedness is associated with greater levels of creativity and skill - a disproportionate number of gifted artists, musicians and sportsmen are left-handed.

Or it could simply be that living in a right-handed world means left-handers get used to fighting for their rights from an early age.

The proportion of left-handers in Britain as a whole has risen fourfold in the past 100 years.

Around 13 per cent of men and 11 per cent of women are now left-handed, compared to just 3 per cent of those born before 1910.

Experts say the rise can be partly explained by a growing acceptance of left-handedness.

In the 18th and 19th centuries it was regarded as a handicap and teachers would try to beat it out of their pupils, or tie their hand behind their back to train them to use their ‘correct’ hand.
