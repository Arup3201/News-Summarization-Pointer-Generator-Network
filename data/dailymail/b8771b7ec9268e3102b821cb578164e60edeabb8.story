It took seven match points to do it but Angelique Kerber finally silenced Maria Sharapova, beating the Russian former champion 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 4-6 in the most thrilling match of these Championships on Centre Court.

Sharapova was broken in the first and final game of the match. In between she fought doggedly, as she always does, saving five match points as she served to stay in the match. But ultimately the German was too consistent, scurrying after every ball and surprising with the pinpoint accuracy of some of her shots.

Sharapova’s exit means 2012 Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova is the only Grand Slam Champion left in the women’s draw. If Canadian Eugenie Bouchard was watching, this result will have brought some cheer.

Great start: Kerber roars after taking the first set... and the crowd were fully behind her

The 20 year old had expected to encounter Serena Williams in the fourth round before she took an early bow and had probably anticipated facing Sharapova, rather than Kerber, in the quarter finals tomorrow.

Kerber, at 26, is playing the best tennis of her life and is a consistent performer, reaching the last 16 in ten of the last 12 Grand Slams but she doesn’t carry the same aura as the Russian.

Sharapova, who won here as a 17 year old a decade ago is now free to attend to Sugarpova, her pop-up sweet shop down the road from the All England Club. She may also stay around to watch her boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov take on Andy Murray in the men’s quarter finals.
