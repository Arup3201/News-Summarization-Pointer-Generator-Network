The Sunday Mirror sex sting that led to the resignation of Tory MP Brooks Newmark is a matter of ‘urgent public concern’, the head of Britain’s new Press regulator warned yesterday.

Former judge Sir Alan Moses, the chairman of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), said it was likely the tabloid would face an investigation.

The warning came as it emerged that more than 100 MPs were approached as part of the sting, including David Cameron.

Civil society minister Mr Newmark resigned after the paper revealed he sent explicit pictures of himself to a male journalist posing as a fictitious female Tory activist called Sophie Wittams.

Fellow Tory MP Mark Pritchard has made a complaint to Ipso and said he would contact Scotland Yard over alleged entrapment.

Speaking at the Conservative Party conference, Sir Alan said the matter was being treated extremely seriously.

But he warned a ‘rush to judgment can lead to injustice’, adding: ‘The Mirror is entitled to a fair hearing.’

Political website Guido Fawkes, which carried out part of the sting, last night defended its action and said it was not a ‘fishing operation’.

'MPs have been shown to be corrupt in the past by sting operations,' a statement on the site said.

'How do our critics expect us to prove an MP is exploiting his position for carnal gain?

'This was no fishing operation, it was a narrowly targeted effort.

'The Sophie Wittams Twitter account followed almost 100 MPs as part of the cover story – not to target them – which is obvious given that many of them were women MPs and the list included the Prime Minister. There was no intention to trap the PM.' 

The Sunday Mirror declined to comment but previously defended the sting, saying there was ‘clear public interest’.
