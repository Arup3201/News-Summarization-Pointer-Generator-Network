It may sound like something from a James Bond film, but the latest range of Apple patents detail a stylus fitted with lasers, recording equipment and cameras. 

Dubbed iPen, the tech giant has filed more than 22 separate patents for a smart pen and this latest patent includes modules that have different functions.

These detachable modules could include a camera, audio recorder, laser pointer, power source and more.

Apple has filed more than 22 separate patents for a stylus, dubbed the iPen since 2012. The latest, pictured, includes images of a 'modular stylus'. Each detachable module is shown having a different function including a camera, recorder, laser pointer, projector, gyroscope, and more

Samsung already makes a smart stylus for use with its own products, in particular the Galaxy Note III, known as the S Pen. 

The
 tip of this stylus is designed to mimic the touch of a finger touch, 
yet it will also work even when its hovered about the screen, adding 
what Samsung calls a 'magic wand' effect.

Double-tapping the pen on the screen opens a post-it-style note, while pressing the tip activates the S Pen menu.

Apple began filing patents for the so-called iPen back in 2012. 

Other functions detailed in the patent include a communication circuit, gyroscope and accelerometer.

It also hints that Apple would introduce 'expansion models' over time and users could pick and choose the features they want.

The filing was discovered by Patently Apple.

According to the detail in the patent, the pen would consist of a ‘base module’ with a stylus tip for use with Apple’s iPhone and iPads.

This tip would connect to a ‘stimulation signal circuit’, a processor, and a ‘connection interlace’ used to fix the base to extension modules.

Early iPen patents, dating back to May 2012, featured just a speaker and haptic feedback. One patent, pictured, added orientation features in which the iPen would draw different lines depending on the angle it was being held at

Early iPen patents, dating back to May 2012, featured just a speaker and haptic feedback.

This haptic feature would make the iPen vibrate as it moves around the screen, to tell a user they’ve performed a certain action.

For example, if the stylus was used with a drawing program or app, the feedback would be designed to mimic a brush or pencil.

A separate patent added orientation features in which the iPen would draw different lines depending on the angle it was being held at.

This means users could change the thickness or style of a line, or make writing more closely resemble their own.
