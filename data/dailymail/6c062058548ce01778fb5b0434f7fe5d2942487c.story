It was a day when old friends reunited and bitter enemies were urged to put aside their battles.

But there were probably few attending Baroness Thatcher's funeral who found this request more difficult than Cherie Blair and Gordon Brown.

The two have had a notoriously tricky relationship in private - and often in public - for much of the past 15 years, and their rare meetings are still fraught with tension.

But when they met at St Paul's Cathedral today the pair managed to greet each other with impeccable grace, as Brown placed his hand on her arm and leaned in to kiss his arch-rival's wife on the cheek.

Mr Brown and Mrs Blair's spat stretches back more than a decade. In her candid autobiography Speaking For Myself, released in 2008, Cherie Blair accused Gordon Brown, then Chancellor, of trying to drive her husband Tony Blair out of Number 10 since as far back as April 2004, and it was publicly known that she didn't want him to succeed her husband.

Cherie claimed then that Brown had been 'rattling the keys' above Tony Blair's head, but that even as Mr Blair considered stepping down, Mr Brown refused to back his plans on city academies, foundation hospitals and pension reforms.

She added: 'Tony would have stood down, there is no question. Instead of which Tony felt he had no option but to stay on and fight for the things he believed in.

When Brown then took the stage at Labour's 2006 annual conference in Manchester to claim he felt privileged to have worked with Blair, the premier's wife Cherie was reputedly overheard saying 'well, that's a lie', by Carolin Lotter, a TV producer with the American news agency Bloomberg.

Both Downing Street and Mrs Blair denied the story, with Cherie telling reporters: 'Honestly, guys, I hate to spoil your story, but I didn't say it and I don't believe it either.' But the incident caused further rifts in an already fragile relationship between the Browns and the Blairs.

But
in a publicity interview for her book, Mrs Blair said: 'The problem 
between Gordon and me is not anything personal. It is because I thought 
my husband was the best person for the job and it's a damn difficult 
job. As far as Gordon's impatience about [Tony] moving on was a 
difficulty, I thought it was a difficulty Tony could do without.

'So
I was just terribly partisan for Tony, and I'm sure Sarah is partisan 
for Gordon and so she should be. And the good thing is Gordon is not 
alone in No 10. He has Sarah and has the children, so even in these 
darkest moments he knows there is something important outside politics 
for him.'

Cherie went on to
strain things further, belittling Brown somewhat by claiming that 
her husband had given him pointers on how to win the election.
