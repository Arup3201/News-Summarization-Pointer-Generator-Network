A high school junior has told of her anger after being suspended from school over dying her hair a 'normal color'.

Savannah Keesee from Farmington, Missouri, used a Garnier brand dye kit to permanently color her auburn hair to a 'deep ultra-intense red' while she was snowed in at home with her mother.

However, when the teenager returned to classes at West St. Francis County R-4 this week she was pulled out of the lunch queue and told her new coiffure violated the school's grooming code.

Her mane was apparently branded 'distracting', 'bright' and 'orange' by members of staff.

While the school rules state that non-natural hair colors are not permitted, Savannah argues that her shoulder-length hair isn't purple, green or blue and only a little brighter than her natural shade.

Her 40-year-old mother - who had a helping hand in the transformation - concurs.

'I dyed it auburn, which is what was on the box. And auburn to me is natural, just like strawberry blonde or blonde, or black or brown,' she told KTVI News.

'She just wanted it a little bit different. We had a bunch of snow days, and did some girl stuff and dyed her hair.' 

The mother and daughetr didn't expect any objection to the dye.

However, when the teenager returned to classes at West St. Francis County R-4 this week she was pulled out of the lunch queue and told her new 'orange' coiffure violated the school's dress and grooming code.

But Savannah said that the principal told her to call her mother on Tuesday to be picked up.

She then tried to return to lessons the following day but was instructed to stay at home because her hair remained unchanged.

West St. Francois County superintendent Stacy Stevens said she couldn't comment specifically on Savannah's situation, but he says the hair color policy has been in place for decades.   

'We try to work with the students to be fair. We don't want them out of school, we don't typically have issues with this policy. I think our students and parents are accepting of it. It's been in place a long time, and I think it's a policy that works.'

Savannah refuses to dye her hair back to its original color as a matter of principal. She plans to appeal the principal and superintendent’s decision and take it before the school board.

Her mother, meanwhile, wishes the school would worry about bigger issues.

'Instead of maybe picking up on the bullying, and kids who are actually causing trouble, its hair color,' she concluded. 

Superintendent Stacy Steven has since told DailyMail.com that the hair dye issue has been resolved but she was 'unable to go into specifics'.
