Convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, 60, has been hospitalized, but his lawyer says prison officials won't tell him why.

Attorney Bret Grote with the Pittsburgh-based Abolitionist Law Center said Monday that his client is in the critical care unit of Schuylkill Medical Center in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.

Grote says neither he nor Abu-Jamal's brother, Keith Cook, have been allowed in to see him.

'We're concerned, about as concerned as it gets, about Mumia's health,' Grote told the Philadelphia Inquirer.

A Pennsylvania Department of Corrections official also declined to provide details.

A spokesman for Pottsville's Schuylkill Medical Center says he had no information about Abu-Jamal. 

'We never discuss an inmate's medical condition,' deputy press secretary Susan Bensinger told the Inquirer.

Mumia's hospitalization was revealed Monday when a group of his friends arrived to the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy for a visit and were informed by prison staff that he wasn't there.

While Grote and others had permission with the prison to visit Mumia, the hospital had not yet cleared them.

Grote said he hoped the matter would be cleared up by Tuesday. 

Abu-Jamal is a former Black Panther serving life in prison for the 1981 murder of white Philadelphia police Officer Daniel Faulkner.

His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he's the victim of a racist justice system.

Mumia's death sentence was overturned in 2012. 

Abu-Jamal supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary.

Abu-Jamal has written several books, hosted his own radio show and even has a street named after him in France.
