Newly-single Kelly Brook made the headlines again this weekend, following reports that she has already found comfort in the arms of a new man. 

The TV star is said to be dating James Lee Taylor, 30, after meeting him on the set of a Skechers advert last November.   

The Essex model is just latest in a long line of romances for Kelly, 35, who has jumped from relationship to relationship increasingly quickly over the past decade and a half.

Despite her jaw-dropping looks, a wicked sense of humour, independent wealth and a strong work ethic, Kelly has struggled to find a man to settle down with. 

Those closest to the brunette describe her as loyal, down-to-earth and largely unconcerned with the dazzling beauty that made her a household name.

So why has such a good catch so far failed to find the love that she has been searching for? 

Kelly said herself of her failed relationship history recently: 'They've all been on their a***s when I met them, they didn't have a career or they were at the end of one career and trying to start something else.

'I met them all at a not very good time for them and that's my fault for being nurturing, for being like Mary Poppins. 

'They were all either in debt, or had no job, or they were figuring out what to do.'

Relationship expert Tracey Cox said: 'Some people continually and repeatedly choose partners with problems. Women are particularly good at playing rescuer (a lost puppy brings out all those maternal, look-after-him instincts), but both sexes are guilty of it.

'Rescuers are attracted to people they can help. 

'They become saviours, putting their life completely on hold while they rescue their lover, cheerfully giving up work, friends and family to be at the beck and call of a person who often doesn’t deserve such loyalty.

'Why the need to play doctor and shrink? Because rescuers truly believe that if they love enough, give enough and do enough, they’ll save their lover from their problem.

'You’ve learnt to equate love with being needed. In order to feel loved you have to nurture and solve problems.'

FEMAIL looks back over Kelly's past men, to see where she went wrong: 

Kelly and action star Jason Statham were childhood sweethearts and dated for seven years 

Jason Statham 1998-2004:  

Kelly started dating Jason Statham when she was just 18 years old and he was 30. He spotted her while she was on a modelling job on the Greek island of Santorini and later claimed it was love at first sight.

At the time, Jason was making the big step from professional diver to Hollywood actor, via part-time model, after appearing in Guy Richtie's movie Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels. 

The couple were so serious that they moved into a flat in Sydenham, south London, and later emigrated to America where they shared a house in LA.

Jason wasn't the only once to enjoy some career success - Kelly also gained some small parts in television show Smallville and the remake of The Italian Job. 

The couple were soon engaged to be married and were regularly referenced to as one of the strongest couples in showbusiness.  

But by 2004, the relationship had hit the rocks and Kelly dumped Jason, replacing him with the Hollywood actor Billy Zane.

She said at the time: 'I wasn't happy. I'd been with Jason since I was very young and I knew I needed to branch out on my own.

'It just so happened there was somebody else there, but it would have occurred anyway.' 

She claimed recently that Jason was on a break from his girlfriend Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in 2013, when she split with Danny Cipriani, and he rang to tell her that he still loved her. 

She said: 'Jason called out of the blue and said, "I still love you so much," and I said "I still love you." We'll always still love each other.

'I know that for many years afterwards (the split) he wasn't happy. Neither of us were.'

Kelly and US actor Billy Zane, who starred in Titanic, were together for four years 

Billy Zane 2004- 2008:  

Kelly wasted no time after her split from Jason Statham, moving straight on to the Hollywood actor Billy Zane, who was by then a global star thanks to his role in the Nineties blockbuster Titanic. 

The couple appeared to be blissfully happy together for a few years and Billy proposed to his young girlfriend with a ring said to be worth £35,000.  

But the happiness wasn't to last - in 2008, the couple split and Kelly moved back to the UK. 

At the time, the break-up was blamed on Kelly's desire to spend more time in Britain, but in 2013, she revealed that the actor was too controlling. 

She said: '(He) wanted me either to look like a 1960s Bond girl or a 1950s housewife. That's how he saw me. 

'I felt I had to find out who I was and what my own style was anyway, but it was controlling. 

'He projected all his fantasies on to me. I never had a real life with him. I was always in a fantasy fairy tale.'

First time around, Kelly and rugby player Danny Cipriani dated for 22 months 

Danny Cipriani 2008- 2010: 

Kelly didn't say single for long after her split from Billy Zane. 

No sooner had she moved back to the UK than she was in the arms of Danny Cipriani, then 20, who at that time was a little-known rugby player for the London Wasps. 

The couple had a tempestuous relationship that was rocked by rumours of infidelity and eventually ended 22 months later, when Danny relocated to Australia to try to resurrect his dwindling rugby career.

Unable to maintain her TV work down under, Kelly stayed in the UK and soon afterwards started dating Danny's friend Thom Evans.  

After Danny, Kelly dated another rugby player, Thom Evans, for two years

Thom Evans 2010-2012: 

Kelly and Thom announced their relationship in December 2010 after  dating in secret for a couple of months.

He appeared to be a stable influence in Kelly's life, who enjoyed nights at home instead of flashy film premieres and celebrity parties.

The couple conceived a daughter in 2011 but sadly Kelly suffered from a miscarriage. 

Desperate to keep their relationship on track, Thom proposed and the couple tried for a second child but Kelly miscarried once again. 

She told The Sun last year: '(After the first miscarriage) I went to see my doctor, who said, "The best way to get over this is to try and get pregnant again."

'So Thom and I weren't careful, and just before Christmas 2011, I got pregnant again.

'The look on Thom's face said it all. I think he was terrified ... I had another miscarriage after a few weeks.' 

The couple were unable to overcome the second tragedy though and split in 2012.   

Kelly and Danny's second attempt at a relationship lasted just seven months 

Danny Cipriani 2013: 

Just a few weeks after Kelly split with Thom, she re-started her relationship with Danny Cipriani, who was by then back in the UK with the Manchester-based club Sale Sharks. 

The couple dated for seven months, regularly posting affectionate pictures of themselves in exotic locations, before splitting in August 2013, following reports that Danny had cheated on Kelly. 

She said afterwards of the relationship: 'He wasn't funny or intelligent. 

'His only chat up line was "You're the one. I've never felt like this. I want to have your babies." 

'Except two weeks later he's saying it to the next one.'

Kelly started dating David McIntosh, a.k.a ex-Gladiator Tornado, last January

David McIntosh 2014:  

Kelly started dating David McIntosh, aka ex-Gladiator Tornado, last January after meeting him at a New Year's party in her London bar, Steam & Rye. 

Just 12 weeks later, the model announced on Twitter that the bodybuilder had proposed - and she had accepted. 

But just as soon as their relationship started, it was over. 

The couple split in September following reports that David had cheated on her with his former girlfriend Sarah Harper behind her back. 

After  some serious wooing by David, Kelly relented and they dated again for another couple of months, before splitting again in November following more allegations of cheating. 

She said at the time: 'Maybe it’s not my time to find love at the moment. I just get to focus on myself. There are more important things in the world.'
