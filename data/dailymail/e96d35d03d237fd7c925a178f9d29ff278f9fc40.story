Getting money out of the hole-in-the-wall won't be such a dull experience for the next few weeks as six ATMs have received a funky makeover across the city to get into the spirit of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras festival.

Following such a positive reaction to last year's GAYTMs, the selected ANZ machines are back brighter and better than ever complete with rainbow-coloured receipts for the customers.

As if that wasn't fabulous enough - some of the GAYTMs play dance music that is motion-activated, as well as display messages including 'Hello darling!' and 'Push my buttons' with one machine on Oxford Street displaying a glittering disco ball to really get you in the mood.

ANZ's Australia Division Diversity Council chair Mark Hand, and ANZ staff member David Beks dressed in drag as his alter ego Anzabella to launch the machines including one that celebrates the Dykes on Bikes at Pitt St, one for the bears on George St while the ATMs on Oxford St are in honour of the drag queens, The Sydney Star Observer reported.

'Building an inclusive culture at ANZ is not just important to our staff, but to our customers and the communities in which we work, so we're very proud to be able to mark our ninth year of sponsorship and the second year as Principal Partner by bringing back GAYTMs,' Mr Hand said

'It's very exciting to bring a new element to the GAYTM campaign this year by involving not just Sydney but communities across Australia. 

'It gives Australians far and wide a chance to show their support for diversity and also to celebrate Mardi Gras.'

'The only GAYTM in the village' campaign will see one Australian town awarded a GAYTM during Mardi Gras 

This year, the initiative will also venture outside Sydney's borders with 'The only GAYTM in the village' campaign, which will see one Australian town awarded a GAYTM during Mardi Gras.

Australians can vote for the location they would like to see host 'The only GAYTM in the village' by visiting the GAYTM website or the ANZ Facebook page.

Once again, ANZ is donating ATM operator fees for non-ANZ cardholders from its GAYTMs during the festival to Twenty10, a not-for-profit organisation working with and supporting people of diverse genders, sexes and sexualities, their families and communities. 

While, ATM operator fees from 'The only GAYTM in the village' will be donated to a charity near its location.
