A mother-of-two facing her last Christmas after being diagnosed with inoperable cancer will get her dream wedding after well-wishers donated cash, rings and even a venue. 

Aimee Willett, 26, of Sittingbourne, Kent, made a bucket list of things she wanted to do when she discovered she had terminal cancer - including marrying her fiancé, Michael Bond, 26.

Ms Willett and Mr Bond thought they would never be able to afford their dream wedding - but following a fundraising appeal generous well-wishers have donated thousands of pounds in money and services to ensure the couple get their dream day.

Ms Willett's inoperable tumour was found in June this year and she is now campaigning for a lowering of the age limit for smear tests on the NHS. 

Ms Willett, who is mother to Charlie, eight, and Kaleb, three, has undergone surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy but has been warned she is unlikely to survive until 2016.

The couple, who have been together six years, thought they would never be able to afford their dream wedding in time and have now said they are overwhelmed by the offers pouring in from sympathisers.

Wedding planners, florists, car companies, professional photographers, venue owners and cake makers have all reached out to the couple offering to donate to the event.

Ms Willett wants her boys have the best Christmas ever - and is taking them to Lapland UK as a surprise

Ms Willett has now booked to have her big day in February at Westenhanger Castle in Hythe, Kent.

The Remi Collection, a company from Walton-on-Thames, is providing the rings.

Ms Willett, who previously worked as a waitress, said: 'It's been overwhelming, mental. I never thought this was going to happen. People offering all this, it's lovely, it's beautiful.

'But it's got the message out there to raise awareness which is the only thing I really wanted.'

Westenhanger Castle director Sarah Poole offered the fortified manor house, which was once owned by Henry VIII, for free.

She said: 'It's every girl's dream to get married in a castle.'

Ms Willett said the generosity of her well-wishers has left her feeling overwhelmed

Cinderella's Dreams Wedding and Event based in Sevenoaks, Kent, is supplying chair covers and decorations.

In addition, a fundraising appeal with an original target of £7,000 has raised more than £31,000. 

The target was smashed by an anonymous single donation of £25,000.

David Fairbank, 27, from Suffolk, created the JustGiving fundraising page and said: 'I'm gobsmacked by it and pretty chuffed.

'We don't know who made the £25,000 donation.

'It could be a celebrity or a business person.'

Ms Willett says now hopes to give her family the 'best Christmas ever' as part of her bucket list and is taking her children to Lapland UK.

Last week she said she hopes her story will encourage women to go to their cervical cancer screening and hopes the national smear test age will be lowered.

She said: 'I am bitter about it and I would like to see the age lowered.

'I think 25 is too old - especially if a girl has had a child at a young age.

'The biggest thing for me now is for people to be more aware.

'If you experience anything that's not normal, go to your doctor and get it checked out and when you get a letter asking you to go for a smear test make an appointment straight away and keep it.

'I always thought it would never happen to me because I was young, but cancer doesn't pick an age group.'
