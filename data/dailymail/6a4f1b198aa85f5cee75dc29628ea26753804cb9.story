Mario Balotelli snubbed boss Brendan Rodgers’ orders to applaud the fans as Liverpool’s Champions League hopes suffered a huge setback on Wednesday night.

Rodgers gestured to the Italy forward, who had a late effort rightly ruled out for offside, to go over to the supporters but, instead, he went straight down the tunnel.

This is the second time Balotelli - who failed to register a touch in the Basle all evening - has ignored Rodgers order to clap the travelling fans but the Northern Irishman attempted to defuse the situation.

‘Mario worked hard, he knows his job is to create and to get into the area,’ said Rodgers. ‘We are working hard on it. I’m not sure if he went back out to say thanks to the fans as I came straight in.’ 

Liverpool could ill-afford to lose to Basle — the rivals they will probably need to finish ahead of if they are to avoid going out at the group stage. For next up are home and away clashes against European champions Real Madrid.

Once again, it was a defensive lapse that cost Liverpool dear when they failed to deal with a 52nd-minute corner, allowing Marco Streller to fire home from close range after keeper Simon Mignolet had pushed out a header. 

There was some good news for Liverpool with Daniel Sturridge, who missed Wednesday night’s match with a thigh injury, close to signing a new deal that could net the striker £150,000 per week.
