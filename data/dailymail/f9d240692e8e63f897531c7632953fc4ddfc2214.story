Chilling audio of an 17-year-old admitting to murdering and dismembering a 10-year-old girl and hiding her remains in his home was played before a court today while including his admittance to previously attempting to kidnap a female jogger.

In the five-minute recording Austin Sigg, now aged 18 of Denver, Colorado, is heard telling police dispatch that he killed Jessica Ridgeway and promises full proof and zero resistance with his arrest.

'I murdered Jessica Ridgeway, I have proof that I did. I'm giving myself up completely, there will be no resistance whatsoever,' Sigg is heard in the call recorded on the night of October 23 – 18 days after her abduction.

Murder trial: Austin Reed Sigg, 18, will be charged as an adult in the murder of 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway in October

Sigg's mother Mindy Sigg broke down in court when hearing her own voice on the recording asking for police to come quickly, the Denver Post reports.

'I need you to come to my house, my son wants to turn himself in for Jessica Ridgeway's murder,' the mother tells a dispatcher after his personal confession to her that included admittance that he hid some of the girl's remains in the crawl space of their home.

When asked by a dispatcher if he has a previous criminal history he admits to a previous attack on a jogger involving home-made chloroform he learned to make off the internet.

'The only other (incident) was Ketner Lake, where a woman was attacked. That was me,' Sigg said.

On the day of his confession his 
mother recalled returning home from work to find her son lying on her bed. 
She said he told her that he needed to talk.

'I'm a monster,' he told her before spilling every horrifying detail of his crimes to her.

On Friday Detective Michael Lynch who interviewed Mindy Sigg, shared those details, claiming that Austin Sigg grabbed Jessica from the street when she was walking by his car on the morning she disappeared.

He put her in the backseat and zip-tied her arms and legs before driving around for a bit.

He then brought the girl back to his bedroom, took off her clothes, and tried to choke her with zip ties before strangling her, according to Lynch.

After moving the body to a bathtub he
said he used a saw from the garage to dismember her body. From there he
bagged up the pieces, leaving some in the crawl space and moving others
to a field.

Lynch said Sigg denied sexually 
assaulting as well as torturing Jessica. Those claims were argued by a 
nurse on Friday who had examined Jessica's torso and testified that the girl was bruised, cut and sexually assaulted.

Because of this, three new charges were added including sexual assault and 
sexual exploitation of a child — namely child pornography.

Austin Reed Sigg, 17, is also accused of attacking a jogger in a park on Memorial Day 2012

Four days earlier two FBI agents took a DNA 
sample from Sigg after a tip-off from a neighbor.

As police sought Jessica Ridgeway's 
killer, that person called a tip line suggesting they check out Austin 
Sigg because he seemed preoccupied with death, Westminster police 
detective Luis Lopez said.

Today, he testified that Sigg's DNA evidence not 
only matched Jessica's but also was linked to the clothing of a jogger 
who reported being attacked near Ketner Lake over Memorial Day weekend 2012 - the same attack he mentions in his taped confession.

The 22-year-old woman said she was 
running in a Westminster park when a man grabbed her from behind and 
placed a rag with a chemical smell over her mouth but she managed to escape.

Jessica disappeared while walking 
to school on October 5. Some of her remains were found in garbage bags 
in an open space park five days later.

Today was the first time 
investigators revealed that the bags contained her torso.

A wooden cross was also found that 
was later linked to Siggs as was evidence found in Jessica's backpack 
which contained her glasses, T-shirt, pants, underwear and boots with 
pom poms

The 18-year-old faces 16 counts related to the death of Jessica and six
counts, including attempted murder, related to the attack on the 
jogger.

Hundreds of officers canvassed the 
area at the time and investigated leads and took DNA samples as parents waited with 
their children at bus stops and thought twice about letting them out of 
sight.

Police asked residents to be on the 
lookout for anything suspicious from their bosses, friends and family 
members, watching for things like leaving home unexpectedly, missing 
appointments or changing their appearance.

Lopez said Sigg's mother turned her 
son in on October 23, a day before testing was completed on the DNA 
sample taken based on the neighbor's tip.

An autopsy determined that the cause 
of death was asphyxiation secondary to suffocation or strangulation, according to the Denver Post.

The judge originally ordered the 
hearing to be closed to the public but the Colorado Supreme Court sided 
with media organizations who argued that he failed to show that holding 
the hearing in public would jeopardize Sigg's right to a fair trial.

If convicted as an adult, Sigg faces up to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 40 years.
