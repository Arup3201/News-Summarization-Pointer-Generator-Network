Ellie Harrison was told her long blonde hair was 'too present' when she joined BBC's Countryfile 

She may be the popular and attractive presenter of Countryfile, but Ellie Harrison's good looks have not always been synonymous with a smooth path to success.

The 37-year-old revealed that after her first appearance on the BBC show she was told her flowing blonde tresses were 'too present.' 

She was asked by producers on the Sunday evening show to be more countryside, 'less Hollywood' in her appearance - a statement she believes was related to the long blonde locks that have earned her fame.

It may have come as a shock as the popular presenter grew up in the Cotswolds where her father grew the family's fruit and vegetable and kept chickens and has also worked on conservation projects across the world. She has recently returned to the Cotswolds with her family. 

However she said the statement was an example of the problems she has encountered because of her good looks, as well as the different culture in the UK compared to the US - which she said was far more welcoming.

'It is celebratory over there; they really want you to do well,' the mother-of-two told Countryside magazine.

'It's like over here they would almost rather you were on the edge of a breakdown.'

Mrs Harrison previously worked for the Countryfile Discovery Channel in America and has spoken about the problem of being viewed first for her looks and regarded as a 'blonde, fluffy thing.'

Her long blonde hair has attracted much debate among viewers of Countryfile and the presenter herself admits her tresses get much attention.

Mrs Harrison travelled across the world last year to film a new BBC series called Britain's Big Wildlife Revival

She added: 'I get asked a lot about my hair. It's a subject that always seems to come up.'

The popular presenter joined Countryfile in 2011 and won praise for her calm attitude when she met Prince Charles on the show last year.

Ellie Harrison first became interested in wildlife and conservation while studying geography at King's College University in London. 

She specialised in bio-geography and third world political ecology. 

Mrs Harrison travelled to Zimbabwe to complete her thesis on conservation development and elephant management. 

Ellie Harrison appeared in Nature's Miracle Orphans

While doing a temporary job as a secretary on Channel 5 she was chosen to present Milkshake, which she turned down, but eventually accepted a role to cover Michaela Strachan's maternity leave.  

She travelled across the world to film Michaela’s Wild Challenge, which was awarded a children's BAFTA in 2005.

Mrs Harrison then became freelance, presenting a number of shows including working on the Discovery Channel in America.  

The geographer and ecologist has filmed segments for the One Show in 2006 and currently presents Countryfile, which she joined in 2011, and Wild British Winters. 

She is a regular on the Alan Titchmarsh show and regularly writes for Countryfile magazine.

Earlier this year Mrs Harrison was made president of the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust. 

She also appeared in a two-part series called Nature's Miracle Orphans for BBC One. 

Mrs Harrison grew up in the Cotswolds where her father grew the family's own fruit and vegetables. She has recently moved back to the area with her husband and their two young children.  

She has travelled across the world in her career, visiting Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Indonesia last year to film Britain's Big Wildlife Revival. 

She has also recently been appointed president of Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust. 

Mrs Harrison has previously spoken about her looks being a barrier to her career, with people presuming because she is attractive she will not be able to do her job properly.

Miriam O'Reilly, a former presenter of Countryfile, won a case for age discrimination against the BBC after she was dropped from the show in 2008

The journalist said: ‘It can get in the way of people thinking you’re credible, so I try and shrug it off. 

'I’ve had people approach me – inside and outside TV – who are surprised I can string a sentence together.’

Mrs Harrison grew up outside in the Cotswolds and has two children with her husband Matt Goodman. 

She found her love of animals when she met a former boyfriend at university while she was studying geography. 

She managed to win a scholarship to travel to Zimbabwe to complete her thesis, and has worked in animal conservation across the world. 

This is not the first time the BBC has been under the spotlight for judging women by their looks and age, and Mrs Harrison was candid about being aware that her career in television could stop without much warning.  

In 2008 Miriam O'Reilly was dropped from the show and won a tribunal against the corporation three years later for age discrimination. Her case for sex discrimination failed. 

Miss O'Reilly was axed from the show, along with Juliet Morris and Michaela Strachan, when it moved to a prime time Sunday evening slot. 

She was given three years to return to the BBC but decided to leave in 2012 to launch a service for women facing discrimination in the workplace. 

Miss O'Reilly was replaced by Julia Bradbury, 43 and more than 10 years her junior.
