There were only 27,099 supporters there to see it but Barcelona's lowest crowd of the season watched them give one of their most ruthless displays, beating La Liga's bottom club Elche in the Copa del Rey.

Jeers for Luis Enrique and cheers for Lionel Messi echoed around the 98,000-capacity arena early in the first half. The coach is still battling to save his job and he picked his strongest possible side with Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez reunited up front - all three scored in the first half to all but put Barca in the quarter-finals where they will face thee winner of the Madrid derby between Atletico and Real after the formality of next week's second leg.

Many Barcelona supporters were left asking why tinkerman Enrique had rested Gerard Pique, Dani Alves, Ivan Rakitic, Neymar and Messi in the previous Sunday's difficult trip to Real Sociedad to then play them all against lowly Elche who are currently the worst side in Spanish football.

Suarez looked especially inspired, assisting the first and scoring the second, meaning he now has goals in all three competitions for the club he joined this summer.

Barcelona were both unlucky and wasteful in the first half hour. Neymar should have been awarded a penalty when he was bounced off the ball by Damian Suarez but the referee waved away the appeals.

Then a perfect lofted pass from Messi dropped into Neymar's path. The Brazilian should have scored without breaking stride but he sent his shot wide.

Neymar was all flicks and tricks against Elche's five-man defence and on 35 minutes he was given another chance and this time he didn't miss, hammering home Suarez's slide-rule pass across the face of the six-yard box.

Suarez could have opened his account on 38 minutes but his lob was finger-tipped away by Elche keeper Przemysław Tyton. The former Liverpool striker was working hard though and he created an opening for himself just before half-time before drilling home the Barca second. Neymar was then tripped on the stroke of half-time and Messi scored the penalty, before blowing a kiss to supporters who were making it clear who they backed in the power struggle between coach and star player.

Suarez was involved again 10 minutes into the second half, passing to Messi who threaded a pass through Elche's defence to Jordi Alba, who made it 4-0. And it was five when Neymar rifled in right-footed from the edge of the area.

The Brazilian was kicked by Damian Suarez and taken off as a precaution but it's a measure of  Enrique's popularity-low at the moment that his decision to bring on Adriano was booed by many fans.

Adriano was put through by Suarez and should really have played the return pass but went for the lob instead and was wide with his finish. Suarez did little to hide his disgust. He at least had his fourth goal in a Barca shirt and the team had reminded everyone what they are capable of.

Neymar scored his second, and Barcelona's fifth, goal shortly before the hour mark at the Nou Camp on Thursday evening
