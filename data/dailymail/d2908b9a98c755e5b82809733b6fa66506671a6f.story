Myra Hindley admitted that she was even worse and more wicked than her fellow Moors Murderer Ian Brady, it has emerged today.

She even spoke of her 'love' for children and desire to work with old people if she was ever released.

The child-killer said she was more 'culpable' than her partner-in-crime because she knew better and 'knew the difference between right and wrong'.

Hindley's astonishing confession has been uncovered as secret details about the killer's time in a Suffolk jail were today revealed in prison files.

Self-improvement: Moors murderer Myra Hindley turned herself from a 'brassy blonde' to an 'intelligent, well-educated woman' and even earned an Open University degree, pictured right, new files have revealed

It sees new light shone on her 
clandestine trips to the county's hospitals, and her last views on the 
brutal pair's notorious killings.

Evil: Ian Brady who killed five children with Myra Hindley between July 1963 and October 1965

Hindley, branded the 'most 
hated woman in Britain', was jailed for life in May 1966 for the 
barbaric murders of Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17.

She was also an accessory to the horrific murder of John Kilbride, 12, by Brady.

In 1987 Hindley and Brady confessed to murdering Pauline Reade, 16, and Keith Bennett, 12.

Hindley, who was at Highpoint Prison at Stradishall, near Newmarket, from 1998, died in 2002 aged 60.

Her confidential files were supposed to have remained secret for another 50 years.

But, due to intense public interest, 
they have been released to the national archives and are now being 
studied and ordered by Dr Tom Clark, a lecturer at the University of 
Sheffield.

The typed reports, handwritten notes 
and prison correspondence, which Dr Clark has been working on for three 
years, give a unique snapshot of Hindley through the eyes of fellow 
prisoners, welfare workers, warders and chaplains.

And prison documents, which include a 
final psychological assessment made in the months before her death, 
carry blood-chilling accounts of how she felt about the Moors murders, 
which horrified the nation.

The interviews reveal that although 
Hindley believed Brady initiated the killings her attitude towards 
involvement shifted from 'one of fear to one of a willing participant 
who enjoyed the feelings of affinity with Mr Brady which involvement in 
the offences afforded her'.

Hindley also suggests she recognises 
her own culpability by stating: '...although by the end I had become as 
corrupt as Ian was, there is a distinction...I did not instigate...but I
knew the difference between right and wrong...I didn't have a 
compulsion to kill...I wasn't in charge...but in some ways I was more 
culpable because I knew better.'

Victims: Pauline Reade, 16, left, was their first victim and John Kilbride was killed in 1963

Murdered: Lesley Ann Downey, 10, left, and Edward Evans, 17, right

Twelve-year-old Keith Benett was abducted on his way to visit his grandmother in Manchester on 16 June 1964. His body has never been found

The document reports that Hindley was 'extremely tearful' as she stated 'I've affected so many people.'

She said that coverage of the Soham 
murders in August 2002 - when Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells, both 10, 
were murdered by Ian HuntleyÂ  - had brought back 'painful memories.'

Hindley added: 'I can see how the public perceive my offences since the Cambridge offences.'

During the interviews her lack of 
mobility is also noted, with the claim that her ability to 'engage in 
direct physically aggressive acts' is reduced.

Hindley, who was described in other 
documents at the time as 'generally cheerful' and even 'houseproud', 
appeared to be content with 'unofficial segregation' in her single room 
at Highpoint.

She states: 'I would like to stay 
here...peace of mind...good staff...appreciation of mum's needs...told 
may move to Foston Hall (in Derbyshire)...I do not want to go 
there...too far for visits....prefer to stay here at Highpoint.'

'I've made my funeral arrangements for here in case I die in prison,' said Hindley.

But the Roman Catholic convert still 
hoped she would be released from prison to spend time with her family, 
despite what she admitted was 'the real threat of assassination'.

Hindley added: 'I would like to work 
with old people...know I can~t work with children...but love 
children...would like to be of some help to older people.'

The documents, which include letters 
to then Home Secretary Jack Straw, also chart Hindley's ailing health 
and top-secret operations to take her to West Suffolk Hospital, Bury St 
Edmunds, and Addenbrooke's, Cambridge.

Letters dated December 21, 1999, and 
addressed to senior members of the prison service, said Hindley would be
attending West Suffolk Hospital on December 30 as an in-patient for 
between two and five days after suffering 'ill-health for some time'.

Jailed: Hindley was put in charge of the kitchen on E wing at Holloway Prison in North London and died in 2002 at Highpoint Prison, Suffolk

The letter goes on to say that the 
visit could not be 'out and back' because the 'media are on the scent' 
and the savage multiple child-killer was more at risk of an attack than 
she was likely to escape.

An accompanying document said Hindley 
should be cuffed when travelling to the hospital and on a closeting 
chain when moving from her bed 'mainly to prevent abduction, though 
there is always a possibility of her attempting to escape'.

The report, which stressed that 
Hindley could not be relied upon to keep arrangements secret, added: 'It
is probably fair to say that neither she nor the staff who care for her
here have much real idea of the true risks of her visit to hospital.'

Hindley suffered ill-health throughout
her 36 years in jail and suffered from the heart condition angina, high
blood pressure and brittle bone disease osteoporosis.

Although the exact reason for her 
visit to West Suffolk Hospital is not contained in documents seen, she 
is known to have had heart scans and suffered a stroke while at 
Highpoint - attributed to her heavy smoking - in January 2000.

One document in the archive gives 
details of 'Operation Charlton', the pre-planned admission of Hindley 
into Addenbrooke's on January 13, 2000.

The exercise was named after Hindley's
pseudonym, Christine Charlton, which was used at all times when 
communicating with the hospital.

The document, which includes the exact
route into the hospital, also explains how the prisoner should be 
guarded by officers in civilian clothing.

Hindley died in West Suffolk Hospital 
in November 2002 from a serious chest infection that followed a 
suspected heart attack two weeks before.

She received the last rites from a Catholic priest.
