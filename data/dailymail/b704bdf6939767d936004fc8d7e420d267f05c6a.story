A son found his parents dead in their swimming pool after they both suffered fatal heart attacks.

Nayyar Siddique, 77, collapsed during her regular exercise session in the pool of their garden at their £625,000 four-bedroom detached house in Thorpe Bay, Essex.

Husband Aqeel, 79, a retired surgeon who had mixed with royalty, jumped in to save her - but then also suffered a fatal heart attack, and their son Haroon Siddique, 49, found them both later that day.

He said: ‘My father dedicated his life to helping people and he died trying to help my mother.

‘We are very proud of everything they achieved and that gives us some solace. They were amazing people and were amazing examples to follow.’

Mrs Siddique was found in the pool while her husband was found in the back garden close to the pool edge.

An Essex Police spokesman said: ‘Officers were called to an address at around 7.45pm on Tuesday, July 15, after a man and a woman, both aged in their 70s, were found dead in the rear garden.

‘There are no suspicious circumstances. A report will be prepared for the coroner.’

The Indian-born couple dedicated their lives to aiding others. Mr Siddique was renowned for working as a surgeon in Lesotho, Africa, while his wife fundraised for Save the Children there.

Visit: In 1988, Mr Siddique met Pope John Paul II during his visit to Lesotho as part of his anti-apartheid stance. The pair met at a hospital in the aftermath of a terrorist attack as Mr Siddique treated many of the injured

They had moved there with their two children, Saima and Haroon, in 1969. The family became close friends with Lesotho’s royal family, who still visit Thorpe Bay to keep in touch.

They worked to give aid to poverty-stricken families and had met the likes of Prince Harry, Princess Anne, and Pope John Paul II.

They moved to Thorpe Bay to be near 
their two children and four grandchildren, after ill health forced Mr 
Siddique to retire as a surgeon in 2012. Mr and Mrs Siddique died on 
July 15.

Their son Haroon 
added: ‘The most important thing was they had been with us and their 
grandchildren for the last couple of years. They were really dedicated 
grandparents and being able to see them was a plus for both them and 
us.’

Mr
 and Mrs Siddique brushed shoulders with royalty and even the Pope, but 
remained humble in their quest to help the less fortunate.

The
 couple, who were both born in India, married in 1960 and first moved to
 England in 1962 so Mr Siddique could train as a surgeon. He qualified 
in 1965 and went on to Lesotho, where he became the country’s only 
surgeon in 1969.

He
 was only supposed to be there on a year’s placement, but the couple’s 
passion to help improve the lives of the country’s 1million citizens saw
 them stay.

They developed a
 strong friendship with the royal family of Lesotho - King Moshoeshoe II
 and his sons - the current king King Letsie and Prince Seeiso.

King
 Letsie and Prince Seeiso remained good friends with the family and 
visited Essex to visit the couple and their two children Saima, 53, and 
Haroon.

Discovery: The couple were found dead in Essex by their son, father-of-three Haroon Siddique, 49

Prince Seeiso, who started the charity Sentebele with Prince Harry, even came over to open Southend Medical Centre in 2010.

Mr Siddique developed many new medical services to help residents especially in the more remote areas of the country.

He repeatedly refused to move into the private sector, wanting to help those who needed it most.

His hard work and dedication to the people of Lesotho meant he was awarded an OBE in 1973, aged just 38.

He
 was also awarded the Order of Mothlomi by the King of Lesotho, the 
highest award a civilian can get, for his work and dedication to the 
country’s people.

In September 1988, Mr Siddique met Pope John Paul II during his visit to Lesotho as part of his anti-apartheid stance.

The
 pair met at the hospital in the aftermath of a terrorist attack as Mr 
Siddique treated many of the injured, whom the Pope wanted to meet.

In 2005, Mr Siddique was made the Honorary Consular of Pakistan in Lesotho.

Meanwhile Mrs
 Siddique was dedicating her
 life by working with Save the Children in Lesotho to bring aid to the 
country.

Joining forces with
 the Queen of Lesotho, Mrs Siddique fundraised to take aid to the remote 
mountain villages, ensuring they recieved food and goods.

Their
 son Haroon said: ‘My father had a passion for teaching and 
supported and guided many young doctors in their training who have 
subsequently enjoyed successful medical careers all over the world.

‘My
 mother was a steadfast partner of his throughout his life and provided 
her children and grandchildren the support, guidance and love which will
 remain with them all.

‘She was instrumental in the early 
work the Save the Children organisation did in Lesotho and assisted in 
much charity work. They
 dedicated their lives to those people. Now we are hearing from people 
all over the world calling to send their condolences.’

'Though they met many famous and important people in their lives, they remained humble people'

Haroon Siddique

A
 memorial service is being organised in their honour in Lesotho. He 
added: ‘Though they met many famous and important people in their lives,
 they remained humble people.

‘My father’s passion and joy was the work he did as a surgeon, helping and treating the poor and needy people in Lesotho.’

Haroon’s children, Rahil, 22 and Mariam, 19, are in medical school. His
 younger daughter Imaan, 14, also wants to study medicine. Saima’s 
daughter Humera, 25, is completing a PhD in economics.
