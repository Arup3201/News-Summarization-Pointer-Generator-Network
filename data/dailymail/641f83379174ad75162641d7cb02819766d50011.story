Atlantis was buried beneath the waves by a cataclysm aeons ago. Addicts of Seventies’ TV will know the cataclysm had a name: Patrick Duffy.

The Man From Atlantis was a sci-fi drama featuring Duffy, future star of the Texas soap opera Dallas, as the last survivor of that mythical submerged city.

He had webbed feet and gills, and he could live off seaweed at the bottom of the ocean.

Action packed: Atlantis promises to be a romp through Greek fables

The problem was, Duffy’s acting was so wooden that he floated. The Man From Atlantis was washed up after one series.

Keen to avoid any confusion with this disastrous prototype, the producers of BBC1’s new family adventure serial, Atlantis, have changed everything.

Atlantis isn’t an undersea kingdom, for a start — it’s a hot and dusty walled city on a Greek island.

The hero Jason doesn’t have gills. In fact, he is half drowned when the story starts: half drowned and completely naked.

Just as the Beeb’s previous Saturday evening serial, Merlin, tended to have King Arthur and his knights shirtless, Atlantis star Jack Donnelly is going to be spending a lot of time bare-chested.

This is family entertainment, after all, and Mum needs to be entertained as much as anyone.

Merlin was a wild romp through British fables and legends, and Atlantis promises to treat Greek myths in the same cavalier fashion. 

Great viewing: We had romance, sword fights, supernatural beasts, prophets, mad kings, daring princesses and lashings of humour

Within minutes, Jason was fighting off a two-headed dragon, dodging arrows fired by the city guards and being rescued by a mathematician and a demigod — Pythagoras and Hercules.

The show gets away with it because hardly anyone knows more than a few fragments of the original tales.

In Victorian times it was very different: the myths were treated as serious historical accounts.

Only 225 years ago, Lempriere’s Classical Dictionary dated Jason and the Argonauts to 1263BC, placing the Labours of Hercules four decades later.

Mind you, Dr Lempriere calculated that the world had been created in exactly 4004BC.

Even his Dictionary, however, didn’t believe in Atlantis: ‘Its situation is unknown,’ he said, ‘and its existence is doubted.’

Potential: Their sketch show was promising, the question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out

So the producers of this big-budget show are free to mix history, legend and wild imagination on a gigantic scale, and they take full advantage.

We had romance, sword fights, supernatural beasts, prophets, mad kings, daring princesses and lashings of humour.

Mark Addy, best known to fantasy fans for his role in Game Of Thrones as King Robert Baratheon, played Hercules with a Yorkshire accent. Robert Emms was the nerdy Pythagoras, prone to panicking and shouting things like: ‘They’ve released the hunting lions!’

The pace faltered only when the seeress Juliet Stevenson was grimacing and rolling her eyes, serving up her Mystic Oracle with thick slices of ham. Don’t mind her. She’ll probably get better with practice.

Carry
On veteran Leslie Phillips saucily recalled, in his Portrait, on More4,
that when he worked with Laurence Olivier in the Forties, the great 
actor was secretly gay.

Larry’s male lover was ‘English, one of the best actors you could get,’ Leslie confided. Whoever could he mean?

Atlantis has brought high jinks and family fun back to Saturdays. It promises to be unmissable, as Justin Molotnikov, who directed the first three episodes, explains.

‘Even I don’t know where the story is heading,’ he told me. ‘The actors were running from one set to another, filming different sequences, even different episodes, and it all comes together in post-production like a massive jigsaw.

‘I could read the scripts and find out. I could demand to see the future episodes. But I chose not to… because I want to watch it fresh. I want to keep it special, to sit and watch it on a Saturday with my kids.’

Also making their debut this weekend were the stars of the Edinburgh comedy festival, Graeme Rooney, Paul Charlton and Kevin O’Loughlin, in The Ginge, The Geordie And The Geek (Sunday, BBC2).

Their sketch show was promising. It had seagulls mugging chip shops, Bletchley Park cypher-breakers trying to decode the female mind and a ventriloquist’s doll that was planning to elope with another puppeteer.

The question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out.And they should do something about that abysmal name — at least change it to the Three-Gees.
