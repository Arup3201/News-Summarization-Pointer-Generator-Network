Scott Brown has closed the door on a possible move to England by pledging the next four years of his career to Celtic.

With his present contract expiring in 2016, speculation was mounting that the 29-year-old may be tempted to explore avenues down south sooner rather than later.

Crystal Palace were the latest side to be linked with the Fifer last week but Brown has now headed off any such moves at the pass by committing his future to Celtic until he turns 33.

Brown, who now looks set to end his playing days as a Celtic player, said: ‘It’s an absolute privilege to extend my contract with Celtic, a brilliant football club and with such incredible supporters. This is a place that I call home.

‘Being Celtic captain is a tremendous honour and it is a role which I cherish dearly. The team is in a great place just now and we’re all right behind the manager and the backroom team as they build for the future.

‘I will do all I can with the manager and all the players at the club to deliver the success which our supporters deserve.’

Celtic have previously been reluctant to offer bumper long-term deals to players approaching the age of 30 but they have made an exception in the case of the man who is also now skipper of Scotland.

Brown is keen to pursue a coaching career and it’s understood the prospect of gaining such experience while still playing formed part of the contract negotiations.

The midfielder came through the ranks at Hibs and made his debut in 2002 before winning the League Cup with the Easter Road side in 2007.

He moved to Celtic for £4.4million that summer and has gone on to make nearly 300 appearances for the club.

After a sluggish start to life in green and white under Gordon Strachan, he has developed into an invaluable part of Ronny Deila’s side.

The Norwegian feared Brown might miss much of his first season at Celtic when he was stretchered off in a pre-season friendly against Rapid Vienna, but the midfielder recovered from what proved to be a serious hamstring injury in just two months.

In signing the new deal, he has given the clearest indication yet that he’s content with every aspect of life at Celtic.

A winner of four Scottish Championships, two Scottish Cups and a League Cup in his time at Parkhead, Brown is now in line to complete 11 years’ service with the club – a rarity in the modern age.

However, he will be watching from the stands when his team-mates host Dundee after being sent off against Aberdeen before the international break.
