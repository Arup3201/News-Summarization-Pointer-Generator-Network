Vice President Joe Biden warned on Tuesday 'it's time for Russia to stop talking and start acting' to reduce tension in Ukraine.

Standing alongside acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk in Kiev, Ukraine, Biden called on Moscow to encourage masked, pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine to vacate illegally occupied government buildings and checkpoints, accept amnesty and 'address their grievances politically.'

'We have been clear that more proactive behavior by Russia will lead to more costs and greater isolation,' the Vice President said.

Biden said Russia needs to act 'without delay,' adding, 'We will not allow this to become an open-ended process. Time is short in which to make progress.'

Yatsenyuk was harsher in his characterization of Russia. 'No country should be able to behave like an armed bandit,' he said. 'Russia should stick to its international commitments and obligations. They should not behave as gangsters in the modern century.'

'Or else what?' asked Sen. John McCain on MSNBC after Biden and Yatsenyuk's press conference. 'If they continue to do this, what will we do?'

McCain, who recently visited
 the region, described U.S. allies in Eastern Europe as 'extremely 
nervous' about the intentions of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Arizona Republican called on Obama to give the 
Ukrainian government some weapons to defend themselves.

The ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee also said 
America must show more support for countries under siege. That doesn't 
mean the United States 'must fight' every war, he said, but 'the only 
thing that Putin understands is a strong, viable alliance.'

Biden not disclose in his statement to the press on Tuesday what costs Russia would face if it did not adhere to the international agreement made last week that requires pro-Russian separatists to cede control of Ukraine's government buildings. He merely noted that both the U.S. and Ukraine would prefer a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.

The Vice President also announced the United States will provide an additional $50 million to help Ukraine's beleaguered government with political and economic reforms.

The money includes $11 million to help conduct the May 25 presidential election, including voter education, administration and oversight. It also will help fund expert teams from U.S. government agencies to help Ukraine to reduce its reliance on energy supplies from Russia. Other technical advisers will help fight corruption.

The White House also announced $8 million in nonlethal military assistance for the Ukrainian armed forces, including bomb-disposal equipment, communications gear and vehicles.

'You face very daunting problems and some might say humiliating threats that are taking place indirectly,' Biden told Ukrainian lawmakers

In the most high-level visit of a U.S.
 official since the crisis erupted, Biden met privately with Yatsenyuk 
and acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov on Tuesday and held a
 meeting in front of the press with nine Ukrainian legislators from the 
across the country.

I' want to thank my colleagues for bringing me back home. For 36 years I sat in our legislature, and I used to actually have this seat in our -- I was the chairman of our committee,' Biden told the Ukrainian lawmakers.

'Thank you for making me feel relevant again, back in a legislative body,' he said before moving on to more serious matters.

'You 
face very daunting problems and some might say humiliating threats that 
are taking place indirectly,' Biden said during the publicly broadcast meeting.

He
 told leaders from various political parties of Ukraine that he brings a
 message of support from President Barack Obama as they face a historic 
opportunity to usher in reforms.

'The
 opportunity to generate a united Ukraine, getting it right, is within 
your grasp,' Biden said. 'And we want to be your partner, your friend in
 the project.  And we're ready to assist.'

The group included three candidates 
running for president in the May 25 election — most notably billionaire 
chocolate magnate and front-runner Petro Poroshenko.  Biden told the 
candidates he hopes that they have more luck than he did in two 
presidential runs.

On Tuesday video surfaced of Ukrainian nationals supposedly beating up a young pro-Russian man before throwing him into a river. A police spokesman said: 'We have not had any 
reports of anyone missing or being attacked, this might just be more 
pro-Russian propaganda'

Biden's 
visit comes at a critical time. After a tenuous international agreement 
was reached to de-escalate violence in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russia
 insurgents oppose the government in Kiev, a shootout occurred on Sunday
 at an Eastern Ukraine checkpoint, killing three. And on Tuesday, video surfaced on Ukrainian nationals reportedly beating up a young pro-Russian man before throwing him into a river.

He
 said the United States is an example of people from different cultures 
united as one nation, although he said Ukraine has a big difference. 
'We're not sitting against a border of another powerful nation,' Biden 
said.

Biden told the 
lawmakers a priority for the U.S. is to help them become independent 
from Russian energy supplies.

'Imagine where you'd be today if you were 
able to tell Russia, "Keep your gas,"' Biden said. 'It would be a very 
different world you'd be facing today.'

The
 U.S. Vice President said during his visit Ukrainians have an historic 
chance now that former President Viktor Yanukovych has fled the country 
to stop being a 'kleptocracy' and become a democracy.

'This
 is a second opportunity to make good on the original promise made by 
the Orange Revolution,' Biden told lawmakers in a reference to 2004 
protests that overturned a widely criticized election that had given 
Yanukovych the presidency. Yanukovych later took office but left the 
country amid charges of corruption after violent protests in February.

Biden
 added, 'To be very blunt about it, and this is a delicate thing to say 
to a group of leaders in their house of parliament, but you have to 
fight the cancer of corruption that is endemic in your system right 
now.' He mentioned reforming the courts and finding the right balance of
 power between the president and Rada.

'I
 want you to know I do not underestimate the incredible pressure you all
 are under,' Biden said. 'I do not underestimate the challenge that you 
all face. And I do not underestimate the frustration you must feel when 
someone like me comes along and says this is a great opportunity for 
you.'

But he added that the 
upcoming election may be the most important in the country's history. 
'The truth of the matter is your fellow countrymen expect a whole lot of
 you right now,' he said.

The
 Vice President also spoke with four dozen Ukranian democracy activists 
and students on Tuesday. According to a White House press pool report on
 the meeting, Biden told the group he was most looking forward to 
meeting with them because they are the 'lifeblood' of a free Ukraine.

Biden stressed to the group that corruption is the 'root cause' of Ukraine's problems, and it is significantly hurting Ukraine's economy.

'No one wants to be engaged, unless you're Mr. Putin' in a corrupt country, Biden reportedly said.

The Vice President is now on his way back to Washington, D.C. He will return late Tuesday evening.

President
 Barack Obama did not accompany Biden on the trip. Obama will make a 
previously scheduled trip to Oso, Washington today, where a mudslide 
killed 41 people, before heading to Japan tonight.
