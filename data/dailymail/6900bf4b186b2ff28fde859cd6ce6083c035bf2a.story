A retired NYPD detective severely burned his estranged wife by dousing her with petrol and setting her on fire because she was divorcing him.

Christopher Hanney, 46, of Tampa Bay, Florida, forced Audrey Mabrey, 29, into the garage of their marital home and tried to rape her.

He then struck her four times with a hammer, threw petrol on her and used one of her scented candles to set her on fire, the court was told.

Hanney faces a life sentence after being found guilty by a Tampa jury on Thursday of attempted murder, aggravated battery and arson.

Ms Mabrey, who claimed her husband was jealous of an ex-boyfriend, was passing by Hanney's home in Apollo Beach in November 2009.

She had moved out of their home to an apartment in nearby Brandon, Florida, and they were preparing for a divorce.

They were sharing care of their two small children despite divorcing. Ms Mabrey was on her way to college when the incident happened.

Taken down: Christopher Hanney faces a life sentence after being found guilty by a Tampa jury on Thursday of attempted murder, aggravated battery and arson

Hanney attacked her when she stopped 
by at the house. He tried to rape her and set her on fire, but she 
managed to run away and a neighbour helped her put out the fire burning 
on her.

'This defendant decided to kill Audrey 
Mabrey because he finally figured out that he lost her'

But Hanney claimed he was the 
intended victim, tied to a chair and had a gun put to his head by his 
wife with an armed, masked accomplice.

Ms Mabrey had threatened him with a 
lit candle and petrol bottle, he kicked her and she went up in flames 
when the liquid spilled, he claimed.

Hanney had a full two years in prison to
 develop that false explanation, said Jennifer Gabbard, prosecuting, 
reported the Tampa Bay Times.

Before attack: Audrey Mabrey was in a coma for a month after the attack and had seven surgeries. Eighty per cent of her body was scarred from it

‘This defendant decided to kill Audrey 
Mabrey because he finally figured out that he lost her,’ she said, 
reported the Tampa Bay Tribune.

He had even written her a letter from 
jail begging forgiveness, insisting that she was still beautiful and she
 loved her more than ever.

Hanney wanted to commit murder and suicide on the same day, Ms Gabbard added.

Ms Mabrey was in a coma for a month 
after the attack and had seven surgeries. Eighty per cent of her body was scarred from it.

Mother and boys: Ms Mabrey, 29, is seen playing a park with her two children, whom she had with Hanney

Her dad Richard Brown said he was told about the attack by a plainclothes policeman who came to his home in Texas, reported the Tampa Bay Times.

'I'm just relieved'

However in an unfortunate miscalculation 
Mr Brown had tackled the officer to the ground outside his home as he 
thought he was an intruder.

Mr Brown and his wife, Lisa, could not recognise their daughter because of the scarring when they came to see her at Tampa General Hospital.

After she recovered Ms Mabrey became a campaigner against domestic violence. Hanney will be sentenced in March. ‘I'm just relieved,’ she said.
