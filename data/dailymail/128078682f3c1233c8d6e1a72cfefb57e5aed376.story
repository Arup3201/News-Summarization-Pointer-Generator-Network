Most holidaymakers will bring back a suitcase full of souvenirs and a rapidly fading suntan from their foreign travels.

But the chances are they will also return with a stack of leftover holiday money.

In fact, a new survey has revealed that Britons are currently hoarding a total of almost £3bn in unused foreign currency from their travels abroad.

Two thirds of the UK population admit to stashing away their holiday cash, rather than converting it back into pounds.

The average household now has an average of £110.45 in leftover cash post trip according to the study by Zopa, a peer-to-peer lending company.

It adds up to £2.92billion of discarded currency across the country.

The study revealed that only 13 per cent of people bother to exchange money when they return from a holiday, with just 16 per cent of those asked saying they plan to use it the next time they go away, meaning that most of it goes unused.

Two thirds of people questioned said they had two or more types of foreign currency at home.

Seventy-nine per cent of people admitted to having euros, 43 per cent had US dollars, seven per cent had Canadian dollars and Swiss Francs, six per cent had Australian dollars and five per cent had Thai baht.

Holidaymakers who want to sell back their foreign currency are often faced with poor rates of exchange when trying to sell their foreign money back.

A Zopa spokesman has advised that holidaymakers convert their money straight into the next currency they will be using abroad to avoid the cost of exchanging it into pounds and then back again.

Travel companies often advise donating leftover coins to charities, with major organisations such as the Alzheimer’s Society, Age UK, Barnardo's and Oxfam all running schemes whereby travellers can donate unwanted foreign coins to them at their branches.

Some airlines also perform collections during flights, while there are also collection boxes for charities at airports.

Travel experts have also advised that one of the cheapest and easiest ways to exchange travel cash is to sell it to a friend at the same rate you bought it for.

They suggest that not only will travellers be able to get the same rate that they bought it for, but both parties will be able to cut out any commission and fees charged by currency exchange companies.

While many of the popular currency providers don’t often list on their websites how much they will buy back currency for, some firms offers a ‘buy back’ scheme.

Travelex, Sainsbury's, Moneycorp, Post Office and the Currency Club all offer this services where they will buy back currency sometimes at the rate customers bought it at. 

However, this can come at an extra charge and you will have to have bought it from them in the first place.

Alternatively for travellers who have been abroad with family and friends, experts have suggested that customers might be able to negotiate a better exchange rate by putting all the cash together before selling it back.

Bob Atkinson, travel expert, from Travelsupermarket.com says: ‘Large transactions of a few hundred pounds worth can be negotiated on – the more you are wanting to change back, the better the deal you will get on major currencies.’
