Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure says the players owe it to the supporters and the owners to turn around the deficit they face going into Wednesday's Champions League clash with Barcelona.

Manuel Pellegrini's side travel to the Nou Camp having been beaten 2-1 at the Etihad three weeks ago with a place in the last eight of the competition at stake.

City go into the game off the back of a disappointing run of form, including defeat by Burnley last Saturday, that has seen their Premier League title challenge slip.

Toure accepts that City are in a difficult moment but insists the players are working hard to give the supporters something to cheer as they look to reach their first Champions League quarter-final. 

'We all know what we have to do, the owners have spent a lot of money to make this one of the top clubs in Europe. We have had some difficulties but we are working hard.

'It's not the first time we have been in this situation. We'll try to do it for the fans and the club and the people who continue to help us.'

The Ivory Coast international was also forced to bat off questions about his manager's future.

'I think football is like that,' said the Ivory Coast international to a question concerning the speculation surrounding Pellegrini.

'Last year was brilliant, everyone was saying Manchester City are a top team in Europe - but all of a sudden we have some problems and we're the worst team in the world.

Meanwhile, Fernandinho believes City can take inspiration from the away performances in the Champions League by Schalke and PSG, who beat Real Madrid and Chelsea respectively.

'Last week, there were two teams that played with character away from home and our intentions are the same.

'Schalke and PSG played great football, and our team can probably be inspired by these two teams and their results - maybe it can help a little bit.

'But more important than that is to make sure we do our job, play our game, play against Barcelona on the same level and try to win.'
