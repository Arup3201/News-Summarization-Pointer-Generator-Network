Three weeks ago Peter Bowles went with his wife Susan to visit the battle sites of World War I. ‘Not because of the centenary, but because I’m getting old and because I’ve always been aware of the tremendous loss of life and personal sacrifice.’

Peter was so disturbed by the sheer horror of it all they cut short the trip. ‘We went to Passchendaele where there are 42,000 gravestones and at least a third of them say: 'Known only to God.'

‘We’d gone with a terrific lecturer who was a professor of history and an ex-Gurkha.

Peter Bowles at his home in Barnes, London, is preparing to star in a new play at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival

He said: 'See these fields? In three days 85,000 men died capturing that hill. A quarter of a million were wounded. They’ve only found 42,000 under the ground we’re walking on because the mud was so deep, so there are thousands and thousands of skeletons here still.'

‘A few days later the Germans came back and took the hill again. So there was such an incredible loss of life for what? It was so disturbing.’

This is a very different, reflective Peter to the actor who’s brought so much laughter into our lives through TV comedy classics To The Manor Born, Perfect Scoundrels and The Bounder. But Peter has extraordinary depth. 

Next week he takes up a guest role at the Edinburgh Fringe in Malcolm McKay’s Forgotten Voices, based upon the book Forgotten Voices Of The Great War by Max Arthur. 

Taken from the Imperial War Museum’s recorded testimonies of the veterans of World War I, it is a series of vividly moving accounts of battle and its terrible aftermath.

The play has already opened to rave reviews with Julian Sands and Robert Vaughan in the guest role. Peter will be followed by the likes of Christopher Timothy and Robert Powell.

‘It’s such a privilege to be able to express some of the things that happen to men in war,’ he says.

His
 home in Barnes, South-West London is lined with books — an early 
obsession. By the age of seven he had devoured the novels of Dickens, 
and reading aloud to his primary school class led him into acting.

After
 leaving grammar school at 16, Peter won a scholarship to RADA, where 
his contemporaries included Richard Briers, Alan Bates, Peter O’Toole, 
Roy Kinnear and Albert Finney. Only Finney remains.

O’Toole
 died shortly before Christmas aged 81. Last year, Peter was mourning 
his ‘dear friend’ director Patrick Garland, and before that the 
much-loved The Good Life star Richard Briers.

Peter Bowles recently went with his wife Susan to visit the battle sites of World War I but cut the trip short

He is pictured with on-screen wife Penelope Keith in To The Manor Born (left) and right with her at Keith Waterhouse's memorial service and his contemporary Peter O'Toole, who died before Christmas aged 81

‘Dear Ann [Briers’s wife] is fine,’ Peter tells me. ‘I was talking to her last week.’ And Patrick’s wife Alexandra? ‘She died a year after him. She had breast cancer.’

He is a kind, loyal friend and each death touches Peter, now 77, deeply, as well as making him aware of mortality. ‘There’s a bell up there,’ he points to the ceiling. ‘When I was at O’Toole’s memorial I was aware of that.’

Peter was just 13 when his best friend was knocked off his bike near his Nottingham home. ‘I went with a friend to see him in his coffin,’ says Peter. ‘In those days, working-class people used to lay the person out in the best room. There was my best friend — his name was Bosworth — lying in his coffin, his face probably made up a bit.

‘Walking back from there, these two 13-year-old boys talked to each other in a way they’d never talked before in their lives because they’d seen death.

‘It made me aware of love. That early, you don’t realise you have loved. If it’s a wife or a girlfriend, you know. But when you’re 13 and it’s a friendship, you don’t know until someone is taken from you.’

Peter and Susan, to whom he’s been blissfully married for 54 years, moved to their current home ten years ago.

There are council flats on the street opposite their current home and it isn’t very flash. But, inside there’s a huge vaulted hallway and floor-to-ceiling glass looking out on to an oasis of a garden.

He likes the flats opposite — they’re part of his roots. ‘I have a peculiar dichotomy in my background in that my parents [his father was a chauffeur/butler and his mother a nanny] worked for posh families but came from absolute basic stock,’ he says.

He is known for several TV comedy classics including To The Manor Born, Perfect Scoundrels and The Bounder

One such posting was at the massive Hinchingbrooke House in Cambridgeshire, where his father worked for the Earl of Sandwich. ‘My father taught the Aga Khan, who was a friend of the family, how to ride a bicycle.’

When the war came, Peter’s father went to work in a Rolls-Royce engine factory in Nottingham. The family moved to a ‘sort of Coronation Street two-up, two-down, no bathroom and an outside lavatory where all the ladies left the doors open to talk to each other sitting on the loo.

‘Inside the house my parents practised the sort of manners where if a lady came into the room, you’d stand up. Outside in the street it was the rough and tumble of real working class. I still go back sometimes and wander up and down the streets.’

At RADA, his Nottinghamshire accent was knocked out of him.  ‘When I came out, I didn’t know who I was,’ he says. ‘That, if anything, hampered my acting.

‘My parents saved up for a Burton suit when I was 17. I wore it for interviews. Most actors dressed as if they worked in a factory, in donkey jackets and caps.

‘And there was me, a working-class person, with this learnt accent and a suit.

‘The director Lindsay Anderson said: “Oh, Peter Bowles can’t act because I saw him in a suit.”

Funnily enough, not long ago, I went up for a part of a Major-General in the Indian Mutiny. I’d put on a suit and stood in front of these Americans who laughed. They said: "We’ve never seen an actor in a suit before."

‘So I dropped my trousers and said: “I’ll read for you like this if it makes you happier".'

The young Peter would never have had such chutzpah. In fact, it wasn’t until he was 50 that he finally ‘knew who he was’.

He was appearing in The Entertainer when its playwright, John Osborne, threw down the gauntlet one matinee. ‘He said: “I want to see acting that I haven’t seen in the British theatre for 25 years.” He came to the dressing room later, threw his arms around me and said: "You’ve done it!"

‘I realised the most important thing for an actor is not talent, it’s confidence. At 13, you are going to live for ever.

‘That’s why those boys going to war at 17 or 18 went over the top: they didn’t understand their own mortality. When you get older, you do, and you think: "If only I’d known how wonderful youth is. If only I’d had the confidence".'
