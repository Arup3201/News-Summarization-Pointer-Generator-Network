Extremist: Haitham al-Haddad's speech has been pospon

An extremist preacher is still set to speak at Jihadi John's former university after this week's talk was postponed due to 'security concerns' on the day the Islamic State executioner was unmasked. 

Haitham al-Haddad was set to visit the University of Westminster on Thursday, despite more than 3,000 people signing a petition - launched by the  lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) society - opposing the event.

Last night, the  Islamic Society (ISOC) said it has no links with Mohammed Emwazi - the Londoner revealed to be Islamic State's merciless executioner Jihadi John - and is not associated with any extremist organisations.

But in a statement, the society said: 'The ISOC will not be going back on the decision to invite Shaykh Haitham al-Haddad to our event, nor will we apologise for doing so.

'We are more than happy to invite our esteemed teacher to provide us with beneficial knowledge once again, and have no qualms with looking to invite him again in the future.'

The visit was postponed due to 'increased sensitivity and security concerns' after Jihadi John's true identity was revealed.

Today, a spokesman for the university told MailOnline: 'All Student Union events with external speakers or any events that have been deemed sensitive have been suspended.'

Earlier this week, former student Raheem Kassam claimed the University of Westminster was a 'hotbed of radicalism' where students 'celebrated 9/11'.

Mr Kassam, who now campaigns against extremism at British universities, said the conditions at the university are right for the radicalisation of someone like Emwazi.

He said: ‘I did not know him, he would have been two years behind me, but I am utterly unsurprised.

‘The university was nothing less than a hotbed of radicalism when I was there. 

'I once walked into a meeting of the Islamic Society where they were clapping and cheering the events of 9/11. 

‘Universities across the country, the University of Westminster in particular, are being targeted by radical recruiters.'

In 2012, the Student Rights - an organisation set up to combat extremism in universities - found a number of videos featuring convicted terrorists and members of terrorist organisations overseas had been shared with students at the university via Facebook.

According to the Henry Jackson Society - a think tank which works alongside Student Rights - only last year Murtaza Khan was invited to speak at the Islamic Society’s annual dinner. The title of his speech was The Day of Judgment.

Khan has a history of encouraging communal division, once asking: ‘For how long do we have to see our mothers, sisters, and daughters having to uncover themselves before these filthy non-Muslim doctors?’

It's claimed he has also encouraged British Muslims to turn their back on our customs and rituals.

It has been reported this week's planned speaker, Dr al-Haddad, said gays should be outlawed,  terror boss Osama bin Laden will go to heaven, Jewish people are descended from 'apes and pigs', and has also spoken out in favour of female genital mutilation, but he has claimed in the past his comments have been misinterpreted.

He serves as a judge for the Islamic Sharia Council and is chairman of the Muslim Research and Development Foundation.

This organisation says it is ‘devoted to the articulation of classical Islamic principles in a manner that provides a platform for Islam to be the cure of all humanity’s ills'.

The statement from ISOC said the event - entitled Who is Muhammad? - would have been a lecture on the Prophet Muhammad and no LGBT topics were scheduled to be discussed.

'We have invited him because, despite the bad press he continually receives, the malignant rumours and misquotations gleefully spread about him, he is one of the most knowledgeable Islamic figures in the UK, and the ISOC is honoured to invite him to speak for us,' it added.

'Individuals who are upset and believe Shaykh Haitham supports FGM (female genital mutilation) and is a virulent homophobe have been suckered in by the aforementioned scaremongering carried out against him, a man who has given up a massive portion of his life simply to the betterment and education of a much-maligned, ostracised and pressured Muslim community in the UK.'

But the university has also been criticised for segregating male and female students during talks by Islamic scholars. It was one of 21 university institutions which were found to promote gender segregation.

'I did not know him, he would have been two years behind me, but I am utterly, utterly unsurprised,' Mr Kassam said. 'The university was nothing less than a hotbed of radicalism when I was there.

'Are the conditions at Westminster right for the radicalisation of someone like him? The answer is yes, 100 per cent.

'I once walked into a meeting of the Islamic Society where they were clapping and cheering the events of 9/11. It was at that moment in my life I realised I wanted to set up an organisation in my life to tackle it.

'Having been brought up in a Muslim household and then seeing that happening is pretty galling stuff.

'Universities across the country, the University of Westminster in particular, are being targeted by radical recruiters. These guys [students] are being professionally radicalised. They tried it with me and they try it with any Muslim.

'I remember very vividly how I would get cornered by three or four Somali guys - students in the class with me who were dressed in non-western clothing – and they would say I must come along to the Islamic Society meetings otherwise I’m not a proper Muslim.

'When you are 18-years-old and a practising Muslim you feel inclined to go. I went along and saw what was happening and it absolutely disgusted me.' 

A spokesman from the University of Westminster said: 'We take these allegations very seriously. We condemn any behaviour that promotes terrorism and violence on any of our campuses.

'We have strict policies to promote tolerance among our 20,000 student community, who come to study from over 150 nations.

'Any student found to be engaging in radicalised activity would be referred to disciplinary procedures. 

'As a London-based university operating in a diverse multi-cultural city, we are fully aware of all the influences within this international city. With other universities in London, we are working together to implement the Government’s Prevent strategy to tackle extremism.

'We strongly encourage anyone who is concerned about radicalisation to speak out and contact the Student Support and Well-being team. The safety and security of our students is our foremost concern.' 

Research by Student Rights - a group which aims to prevent extremism at universities - said that from September to March 2013, 46 events at 21 separate institutions were found to have been segregated.

At the University of Westminster, at least two events were found to have been advertised as ‘women only’. 

But the university claims it does not allow gender segregation and it will 'not tolerate this type of prejudice'. 

'The university strictly complies with the Equality Act 2010 the Human Rights Act 1998,' a spokesman said. 'The events concerned were not gender segregated events. 

'The Islamic Society is one of many societies that are part of the University of Westminster Students’ Union which is an independent body. The university does not control its activities but does monitor that it is legally compliant.'

MailOnline contacted Dr al-Haddad for a comment but received no reply.
