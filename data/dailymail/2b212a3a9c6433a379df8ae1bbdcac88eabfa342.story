In what could be a pioneering move for air travel, one airline has decided to combat the problem of bland in-flight food by pairing music to meals.

It may sound like an unusual idea,  but the method has backing from scientific research, with an Oxford professor suggesting the right music can influence tastebuds.

To put it to the test, British Airways created a unique Sound Bite soundtrack, for customers dining at 35,000 feet .

British Airways has created a unique Sound Bite soundtrack based on an Oxford University study which revealed that specific music can alter the taste of specific food and drink

Dining at 35,000 feet: The ability to taste is reduced by 30% in the air

Known as 'Sonic Seasoning', Professor Spence's study found that specific music can make food appear up to ten per cent more sweet or salty.

With that in mind, BA's 13-track playlist will be available to passengers via its Rock and Pop audio channel on long-haul flights from November.

Diners start with a choice of Paolo Nutini to complement the Scottish providence of the salmon dishes, or Louis Armstrong ideally matched for savoury dishes.

Johnny Marr's New Town Velocity is the 'perfect musical accompaniment' to a full English breakfast

1. Artist: Paolo Nutini, Scream (Funk My Life Up). Food: Scottish salmon starter. Findings: Scottish musicians can enhance the providence of Scottish foods.

2. Artist: Anthony And The Johnsons, Crazy in Love.Food: Savoury starter. Findings: Low tones complement savoury starters 

3. Artist: Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, Azalea. Food: Savoury starter. Findings: Low tones complement savoury starters.

4. Artist:  Johnny Marr, New Town Velocity. Food: Full English breakfast (early morning flights). Findings: British music should be paired with British food. 

5. Artist: Lily Allen Somewhere only we know. Food: Classic British main meal. Findings: Piano notes can enhance the sensation of sweet and bitter tastes. British music should also be paired with British food.

6. Artist: Coldplay, A Sky Full of Stars. Food: Classic British main meals. Findings: British music should be paired with British food. 

7. Artist: Debussy, Claire De Lune. Food: Main meal/roast dinners. Findings: Classical music suitable for meals like Sunday lunch.

Piano notes enhance the sensation of sweet and bitter tastes.

8. Artist: James Blunt, You’re Beautiful. Food: Dessert. Findings: High-tones boost sweet flavours.

9. Artist:Madonna, Ray of Light. Food: Dessert. Findings: High-tones boost sweet flavours.

10. Artist: Otis Redding, The Dock of the Bay. Food: After-dinner chocolate. Findings: Low tones can bring out the bitterness in chocolate.

11. Artist: The Pretenders, Back on the Chain Gang. Drink: Red wine. Findings:Rock music can enhance depth of flavour, making red wine appear more ‘heavy’.

12. Artists: Hope/BBC Symphony Orchestra/Shostakovich, Romance from the Gadfly, Op.97. Drink: White wine. Findings: Classical music can enhance the overall experience and perceptions of quality when paired with wine.

13. Artist: Plácido Domingo, Nessun Dorma from Turandot. Drink: Coffee. Findings: Tenors low tones are suited to the bitterness of coffee.

Lily Allen and Coldplay are among the choices for main meals, as the findings claim that 'British food and music belong together'. 

For those choosing a hearty main, Debussy is available, since classical music is perfectly paired with roast-style dinners.  

For dessert, high-pitch tones from James Blunt and Madonna bring out the sweet flavours.

Sonic seasoning can also have an effect on drinking wine, with classical and rock music said to enhance perception of quality and depth of flavour.

Classic coffee: Plácido Domingo's voice is suited to the bitterness of coffee

The Pretenders have been chosen to accompany red wines, as they can make it appear more 'robust' and 'heavy', while white wine is served with The BBC Symphony Orchestra, since classical music can enhance the perception of its quality. 

To round off the meal the low tones of Tenor Domingo are a great match for coffee. 

Professor Charles Spence from Oxford University, who conducted the study, said: 'In the coming months and years we are going to see far more interest in the matching of music and soundscape to what we eat and drink. 

The low tones of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong can complement savoury starters

For dessert (right), high-pitch tones from James Blunt can bring out the sweet flavours 

'I think that it is a really exciting and innovative development to see British Airways taking the first steps in this direction.'

Mark Tazzioli, British Airways' chef said: 'Your ability to taste is reduced by 30 per cent in the air, so we do everything we can to counteract this. 

'As the "fifth taste" we use umami rich ingredients in our meals, and choose wines that work well with these dishes. 

'The sonic seasoning research is fascinating, and our pairings should really help bring out the flavours.'
