Experts fear a repeat of the devastation caused by Dutch elm disease as an infection threatens a third of the country’s trees.

Importing ash trees is to be banned Monday, following the burning of 100,000 specimens with ash dieback.

The fungal infection, which ravaged other European countries before spreading to the UK, kills 90 per cent of the trees it affects.

Forest favourite: One of Britain's 80 million ash trees, which could soon be wiped out

Desperate measures are being taken  to
protect Britain’s 80million ash trees, which support wildlife as well 
as the £10billion timber industry.

Experts believe it may already be too 
late to prevent an environmental catastrophe on the scale of the Dutch 
elm disease outbreak that destroyed 25million trees in the Seventies and
Eighties.

Ministers have been criticised for 
failing to act earlier when the parasite was first detected in a nursery
in February. It is now feared to have spread to 20 sites.

Mary Creagh, Labour’s environment 
spokesman, said the Government – which only opened a consultation on ash
dieback with businesses and scientists last month – had been ‘asleep on
the job’.

The disease was found at the start of 
the year in a consignment of 2,000 trees imported from the Netherlands, 
most of which had already been sold by the time the infection was 
detected.

Last week the first cases in mature 
trees were confirmed in East Anglia. Saplings in Leicestershire, 
Yorkshire, Buckinghamshire and Scotland have also been affected.

Ash dieback’s microscopic fungus –  
chalara fraxinea – infects the leaves, bark and wood of ash trees, 
causing them to develop black spots and cankers, and then wither and 
die.

Stop dieback: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is 'ready to go' on the ban which has been blamed for the introduction of the fungus in Britain

Owen Paterson, the Environment 
Secretary, said yesterday: ‘We will be introducing a ban on imports. I 
have already prepared the legislation and we are ready to go.’

The 
movement of saplings around the country will also be strictly 
controlled.

A task force of 100 people from the 
Forestry Commission and other bodies are now tracing all ash imports 
into the UK for the past five years – at thousands of sites – in an 
attempt to trace when the disease first arrived here.

Ash dieback has devastated mainland 
Europe, from where more than a million of Britain’s ash trees have been 
imported over the past two years.

It has all but wiped out common ash 
species in Denmark, Poland and Lithuania.

A survey has found 20 ‘suspicious’ sites in Britain, but they are yet to be confirmed by scientists.

Stuart Burgess, of the Forestry 
Commission, said it was a race against time to detect new cases before 
the falling of autumn leaves made them very difficult to track.

There are concerns that the fungus may
have been lurking undetected for several years, as it can take this 
long before it becomes apparent.

Scientists are not certain how it 
spreads, but they suspect it is carried by rain, wind or insects.

About 58,000 trees have been burned in Scotland so far, with a further 40,000 destroyed around the rest of the UK.

The Horticultural Trades Association 
said it first raised the issue of ash dieback in 2009, when it called 
for import restrictions.

At that stage the disease was thought to be 
caused by a fungus already endemic in Britain, making a ban ineffective.
It has since been discovered that the fungus is a new one.

Tim Briercliffe of the HTA said it was
‘hugely disappointing’ that the Government had not acted more quickly.

‘We are looking for Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and 
Rural Affairs] to provide compensation for growers that have suffered as
a result of this,’ he added.

Steve Marsh, of the Woodland Trust, 
said: ‘We feel this hasn’t been taken as seriously as it should. We 
should have an emergency summit like we had with foot and mouth disease.

'This could rip massive holes in our landscape – it kills the tree, so 
it could easily be as bad as Dutch elm disease.’

Dame Fiona Reynolds, the outgoing 
director-general of the National Trust, warned that an outbreak in the 
UK could be ‘horrific’.

‘We’re just praying that this ash dieback can be
understood, and managed, quickly,’ she said.

Harry Cotterell, president of the 
Country Land & Business Association, said it was a ‘great pity’ that
an ash tree ban was not announced earlier in the year to prevent 
further imports from Europe, where the disease is rife.

Mr Paterson denied that the Government
had taken too long to act, saying a ‘detailed process’ would be carried
out at 1,000 sites to identify where trees had come from.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said:

'As soon as the first case was 
confirmed in February, we immediately began to trace its source, so we 
could get it under control and minimise the spread of the disease.

'We immediately arranged for any 
infected trees to be destroyed.

'We held urgent talks with the industry 
about the impact of Chalara Fraxinea resulting in a voluntary import 
ban.

'I announced last week that a ban on the import of ash trees and 
movement controls within the UK would come into force on Monday/today, 
well before the planting season begins.

'I have set up a new plant health task
force which will look at further ways to prevents pests and diseases 
from entering the country in the future.'
