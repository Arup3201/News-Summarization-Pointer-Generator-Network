Marks & Spencer has scooped top honours at the International Wine Challenge Awards (IWC), taking home the prestigious Supermarket of the Year Award for the second year running.

The IWC awards are considered one of the most prestigious and respected of competitions in the wine world, but the supermarket’s victory represents more than the knowledge that good wine ins available on the high street.

The six-strong team behind M&S wines is all female, as women make more and more headway into this traditionally male-dominated industry.

The last few years have seen a succession of women sip their way to victory with the past two winners of the renowned Palate contest being female.

One member of the award winning wine making team from M&S, Emma Dawson says: ‘We are seeing more and more women at the top of the industry.

'The Master of Wine winemaker of the year was awarded to Anne Marie Leflaive, and increasingly, many of our winemaking partnerships include top winemakers from around the world who are women.

‘It makes perfect sense, as women have many attributes perfect for winemaking: they are said to have a more sensitive palate, which is crucial for tasting and blending; not to mention the ability to multi-task – ideal winemaking skill for when you have several parcels of grapes coming in during harvest. ‘

Sue Daniels, another M&S winemaker agrees, saying: ‘Twenty years ago the industry was dominated by men, but as with many industries, there appears to be an upward trend in the amount of women in all areas of the wine industry such as sommeliers, wine buyers and winemakers - which has a positive effect.

‘I think women have been important in ‘de-fuddidising’ wine, in lessening the snobbism associated with wine, and concentrating on more important things – like taste, quality and value for money.’
