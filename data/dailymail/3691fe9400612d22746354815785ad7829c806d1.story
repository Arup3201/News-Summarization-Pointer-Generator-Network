Manchester City and England goalkeeper Joe Hart has shown off his skills in a remarkable video with F2 freestylers Billy Wingrove and Jeremy Lynch.

Hart was put through his paces by the pair, who had provided a number of challenges for the former Shrewsbury Town stopper.

There was no sign of the jitters that saw him questioned by supporters last season as he showed off his talents for Rio Ferdinand's 5MAG.

While there's little doubting Hart's talent as a footballer, some of the tricks on show appeared to portray the 27-year-old as almost superhuman.

Only Chelsea and Southampton have conceded fewer goals in the Premier League so far this season, and after this video it's clear to see why.

Freestylers Wingrove and Lynch have previously done videos with stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Robinho, and performed at the Ballon d'Or ceremony in 2012.
