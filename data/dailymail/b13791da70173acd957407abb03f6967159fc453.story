As the woman to finally tame the world’s most eligible bachelor, Amal Alamuddin has been the subject of much discussion among George Clooney’s family.

But his relatives were left disappointed when work commitments kept the stunning human rights lawyer in the UK when the Oscar winner, 53, made his annual trip to Augusta, Kentucky last week - while his parents Nick and Nina had even painted their house in preparation.

However, many of the Clooney clan will soon have their chance to meet Amal, 36, as the star's aunt Starla Clooney today exclusively confirms to MailOnline the couple WILL wed in Italy in September.

Mrs Clooney revealed the actor's parents are now planning a trip to Italy in the next week or two to 'scope out some stuff' - as she revealed it's likely that A lister Brad Pitt will be Clooney's best man.

Work commitments: HIgh-profile human rights barrister Amal Alamuddin - who has represented Wikileaks founder Julian Assange - missed her fiancé's family reunion in his Kentucky hometown last week. She's pictured here at the global summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict in London on June 12, alongside Clooney's good pal Brad Pitt, his fiancée Angelina Jolie and British Foreign Secretary William Hague

Starla lives in Hamilton, Ohio, with her husband Joe, 60,  who is George’s uncle, where she works as a non-denominational minister, officiating events including weddings in prisons at the nearby Lebanon and Warren Correctional Institutions.

And asked about the wedding, she said: ‘I did hear Cincinnati, since it’s not that far from Kentucky - that’s one of the places they were considering - but apparently Cincinnati didn’t win, it's not going to be the place.

‘I do know that Nick and Nina are planning a trip over to Italy in the next week or so to, I guess, scope out some stuff.'

Starla also thinks the actor and producer will choose one of his Hollywood friends over a family member when it comes to picking a best man, saying: 'I would say he’d choose Brad Pitt for his best man. They are good friends, I would think that’s who he’d choose.’

But she offered her services to preside over a local service if Clooney and Amal decided to have another ceremony in case family can't travel to Italy, adding: 'Sure, I'd do it in a heartbeat!'

Around
 200 of the star’s extended family descended on the town and nearby 
Maysville for a weekend of get-togethers - eager to meet the newest 
member of the clan.

However, Amal was in London where days later she attended the global summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict in London, alongside Clooney's good pal Brad Pitt, his fiancée Angelina Jolie and British Foreign Secretary William Hague.

Ben
 Breslin, 55, a cousin of George’s, who hosted a big party on Saturday 
night, told MailOnline: ‘When he came in the front door, I was looking 
around asking 'Where is she?'

‘He
 explained she’s a lawyer and apparently she’s across the sea somewhere 
working on a case, off saving the world. It was a shame because I would 
have liked to have met her.’

When asked 
if he was looking forward to welcoming a Brit into the family, Ben 
laughed: ‘Not a problem – if she can put up with us, we can put up with 
her. Nina say she’s a lovely girl and if she likes her, she’s in.’

George’s
 parents, retired broadcaster Nick, 80, and Nina, 74 - who runs her own 
shop in the town - had even had their house REPAINTED ahead of the 
occasion.

Family
 friend Ronnie French said: ‘At one time Nick and Nina’s house used to 
be bright green, real bright green and it was completely surrounded by 
shrubs.

‘So
 this year, they hired a person, they repainted it and redecorated the 
outside and took all the shrubs down, and now you can see it.’

He added: ‘His 
family seem to be very pleased about him getting married again. This 
lady he’s marrying seems to me to be an equal to him. And she doesn’t 
have anything to do with the movie business, which is good.

His wife, Diana, added: ‘I thought maybe it was because [Amal] was coming in, but she didn’t. She had business.

'Where is she?!' George Clooney's cousin Ben Breslin, pictured in Augusta, KY, said Amal was the talk of the family reunion and everyone had expected to meet her - but Clooney said she was 'off saving the world'

When
 he is in town Clooney usually stays at either his parents’ house or
 another property they own down by the banks of the Ohio River.

The
 Gravity actor can also show his fiancée some of the local delicacies, 
such as the famed transparent tarts from Magee’s Bakery, or the General 
Store café in Augusta’s main street, a favourite hang out with the 
locals, where his parents dine most weekends.

A
 little further down from the luxury property is the Rosemary Clooney 
House, a museum dedicated to the star’s late aunt, the singer most famous 
for starring in the 1954 film White Christmas.

However,
 one of the rooms is rapidly filling up with props from Clooney's movies 
and on Saturday, June 7, he unveiled two new additions, the costumes 
he wore in O Brother Where Art Though and Monuments Men.

Before the event, Clooney's sister Adelia Zeidler hosted a 
small garden party for the family reunion at her house where she served 
up homemade quiches.

Today, she remained tight-lipped when asked about her brother's wedding - even declining to say whether she had met Amal.

But

 judging by these exclusive photos from the event the brother and sister
 – born just a year and four days apart – are as closer as ever as the 
big day approaches, despite her speaking out 18 months ago to say she 
couldn’t see him ever walking down the aisle for a second time following
 his failed marriage to Talisa Balsam that ended in 1993.

Later
 in the evening they all dined at the family’s favourite restaurant, 
Capronis, down by the water in Maysville.

Ronnie 
is connected to the family via his daughter Heather French - former Miss America 2000 - who was a 
close friend of Rosemary Clooney and bought her house when she passed 
away, turning it into the museum.

Amore: George Clooney's Italian home, Villa Oleandra, lies on the shores of Lake Como. He is tying the knot with Amal Alamuddin in Italy in September - but is not believed to be holding the ceremony at his estate

He said: ‘We’ve
 had several people from England that lived in Augusta and they loved 
it. He might show her that we don’t all go around barefooted in 
Kentucky!’

‘I think his family
 are just glad he wants to get married. I think his parents are pleased 
he’s finally settling down. He’s 53, 54 and he’s not getting any younger
 … If he’s going to be a father then I think its now or never.’
