Jailed: Peter Wood, 44, of Wainscott, Kent, admitted attempted murder

A husband who tried to murder his sleeping wife after discovering she was having an affair with a lesbian has been jailed for 10 years.

Enraged Peter Wood smashed mother-of-two Tina over the head with a rolling pin and then tried to smother her in her pillow in front of their young sons.

Mrs Wood, 34, managed to stagger out of the house but Peter chased her and stabbed her 12 times.

The couple’s eldest son David, 14, ran out in his pyjamas and managed to intervene and he protected his mother until paramedics arrived.

A court heard how Peter planned the murderous attack in February after seeing a Facebook message between his wife and a female friend.

In it Mrs Wood - who had been married for 14 years - revealed she had started a lesbian affair.

Peter, 44, of Wainscott, Kent, admitted attempted murder and was jailed by Judge Jeremy Carey at Maidstone Crown Court on Monday.

The judge told him: 'It is troubling in the extreme you took the course you did. That night you were set on a course you had planned.

'You made the decision to kill the mother of your two sons. You set about that attack with a purpose.

'It is to the credit of Tina Wood that she showed great presence of mind in what was a terrifying ordeal for her.

'You were of good character, a caring father who worked hard to support his family. You have lost all that.'

Martin Yale, prosecuting, said the couple had been together for 14 years after ‘a bit of a whirlwind’ relationship.

When Mrs Wood fell pregnant with their first child her husband ended up on antidepressants and suicidal.

On one occasion he had gone looking for a kitchen knife in a bid to kill her and there were further bouts of violence and rows before they split up last year.

They continued sleeping in the same room but in January Peter discovered his wife had started seeing another woman and attacked her the following month.

He said: 'She could hear him saying he was going to kill her. She began to scream to the boys as loudly as she could.'

Wood grabbed at her throat, but despite attempts by sons David and Oliver, nine, to get him off she felt a stabbing pain to her ribs.

The terrified victim managed to get down the stairs and out of the house but Peter followed and stabbed her in the ribs again.

She fell to the ground and could no longer make any noise at which stage son David went to get a nurse who lived in the street.

Peter called 999 declaring: 'I tried to kill my wife. I need an ambulance and police. I hit her and I have stabbed her too.'

Asked why he did it, he replied: 'I had to do it. I am not explaining. I just had to do it.'

Mr Yale said Mrs Wood was lying in a pool of blood and having trouble breathing when emergency services arrived to take her to London’s King’s College Hospital.

Despite multiple wounds and a collapsed lung, her condition was stable. She believed her life was saved by the eldest son.

A police officer went into the house and found Peter wearing a T-shirt covered in blood with the knife left lying on the floor.

He said he had been planning to kill his wife for two days because he hated her and had recently discovered she was having an affair with a woman.

Wood threatened that he would 'finish her off' if he saw her again.

Judge Carey said David deserved a reward for saving his mother’s life.

He said: 'He showed great courage and presence of mind, not only in protecting his mother, but doing what he could to save her before the arrival of paramedics and the air ambulance.'

Under an extended sentence for public protection, Peter will not be considered for parole until he has served two thirds. He will be on licence for a further four years.

Det Sgt Stephen Biddiss, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: 'It is clear that Peter Wood was trying to kill his wife and it is only through good luck and the intervention of her son, who showed tremendous courage, that she is alive and has made a full recovery today.

'I have no doubt that had Wood had his way, she would be dead and buried, all due to what he perceived as a betrayal when she entered into a new relationship.'
