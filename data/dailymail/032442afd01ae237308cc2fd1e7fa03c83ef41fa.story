Craig Cullen, 29, admitted arson at Swansea Crown Court and faces around seven-and-a-half years in jail

A blundering arsonist was caught while torching a packed nightclub after he managed to set fire to his own feet.

Craig Cullen, 29, was filmed throwing petrol over the back door of the bar, which had 200 people inside, before igniting it into a huge fireball.

But the blaze at Oxygen club in Swansea  got quickly out of control and set the arsonist's shoes alight as well.

Cullen is then seen trying to run away with his feet on fire before he is caught by nightclub staff in April this year.

Owner Kai Lui carried out a citizen's arrest on Cullen who appeared in court yesterday where he admitted arson. 

Mr Lui said: 'We put the safety of clubbers first and we ensure all our 31 cameras are monitored at all times. 

'As soon as we saw what was happening we went to the fire exit and got hold of the culprit until the police came.

'It could have been my children who were in the club at the time. This was extremely dangerous.

Packed: The club, in Swansea city centre, had around 200 people inside on the night Cullen set the fire 

'This could have been terrible and we are glad we were able to prevent would could have been a very serious incident before it happened.'  

Cullen tried to start the fire after getting in an argument with his ex-girlfriend in the street outside the club.

He told her that if she got into the club he would torch it and sent her a text saying: 'I'm going to burn it down you s***.'

Blaze: He then ignites the fire and walks away, but the blaze is soon out of control and his shoes also set alight

Escape: Cullen quickly runs down the steps trying to put out the fire on his shoes out as the blaze gets bigger

Swansea Crown Court was played CCTV which showed him climbing the steel fire escape at the club.

Cullen is then seen splashing petrol all over the steel door before taking a flame from his pocket and setting it alight.

His clothes and shoes catch fire and he is seen trying to sprint away from the scene pursued by a member of staff.

Cullen was due to stand trial but admitted arson with intent to endanger life and was told he faces around seven-and-a-half years in jail.

Assault: Owner Kai Lui carried out a citizen's arrest on Cullen, who also admitted assaulting Mr Lui in the street

He also admitted assaulting Mr Lui after the court was shown the footage of him fighting in the street with club staff.

Cullen, of Mayhill, Swansea, has a previous conviction for arson for setting fire to a speed camera.

He will be sentenced next month for his latest arson.

Police said the quick thinking action of the club staff prevented a disaster.

South Wales Police detective constable Gareth Philips said: 'This could have been a major incident.

'It is down to the actions of the staff and the infrastructure of the club that the people inside weren't injured.'
