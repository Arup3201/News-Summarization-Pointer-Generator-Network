A little girl with Down’s syndrome has learnt to swim, sing, and even dance, by copying her twin sister.

Viola Fuller, six, from Gillingham, in Dorset, has Down’s syndrome, but her twin sister, Nigella, does not.

The girls’ proud parents, Nigel and Agata, say Viola is thriving - and believe she is doing so well thanks to copying her sister.

Mrs Fuller, 35, said: ‘Children with Down’s syndrome are very visual and they learn by copying.

‘Because Viola could watch Nigella reach all these milestones, and then copy her, she has been able to reach them too.

‘We could spend hours with a therapist trying to teach Viola something, but then all she’d have to do is watch Nigella doing it and she could copy.

‘There is a special sign language that people with Down’s syndrome can use, called Makaton. Nigella picked it up easily and was able to teach it to Viola.

‘We always had faith in Viola, but Nigella has made a real difference to her.

She added: ‘There are other factors too, and we have excellent medical professionals who work with Viola to ensure her progress, but they really do have that twin thing going on.’

The girls' parents, Nigel and Agata, believe Viola has had an advantage in reaching her milestones because she is able to copy Nigella

When Viola was born, her parents had no idea how able she would be.

Mrs Fuller said: ‘The doctors are very careful not to say that your child definitely will be able to this, or definitely will be able to do that.

‘Some children with Down’s syndrome get on very well in life, while others will have hearing, visual, speech and various health problems.

‘It was a just a case of wait and see what happens.

Down's syndrome is a genetic condition that causes some level of learning disability and a characteristic range of physical features.

Most babies with Down's syndrome are diagnosed shortly after birth and are likely to have reduced muscle tone, eyes that slant upwards, a low birth weight, a small nose and mouth and short fingers.

They also have some degree of learning disability but this varies widely between children.

Some children with Down's syndrome also have associated health problems such as heart disorders, digestive problems, hearing and visual impairments, thyroid dysfunction and blood disorders.

It is one of the most common genetic causes of learning disability and around 750 babies are born with the condition each year in the UK.

It is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 in the baby's cells.

Currently, no one knows what causes the presence of the extra chromosome but Down's syndrome is more common in children born to older mothers.

For example, if a woman has a baby when she is 25 there is a one in 1,250 chance of her baby having Down's syndrome, but if a 45-year-old woman has a baby, there is a one in 30 chance of it having Down's syndrome.

‘Luckily, Viola is high functioning, and with Nigella by her side - plus many experts, doctors and family members who have helped us along the way - she’s doing really well.’

The couple first noticed Nigella’s influence on her sister when they were learning to walk.

Mr Fuller said: ‘When Nigella began to crawl, we didn’t expect Viola to be able to reach that goal so quickly.

‘But when Viola started crawling too and becoming more mobile, we realised how important Nigella was to her sister.

‘Now, Viola sees Nigella picking up a book to read and she’s started to do it too.

‘Nigella had swimming lessons and now Viola does them too.

‘They’re very close, which is lovely - they both love to sing and dance together - their favourite song is We Will Rock You. It’s a wonderful thing to see.’

Mr and Mrs Fuller were unaware that one of their daughters would have Down’s syndrome.

It was only when the girls were just a few hours old that doctors diagnosed Viola’s Down’s syndrome.

Mrs Fuller said: ‘I had a normal pregnancy and had no reason to expect anything other than two healthy babies.

‘Nigella was born first and then they gave me Viola.

‘I remember thinking that Viola had her eyes shut and that she looked a bit different, but as soon as she opened her eyes I thought she was fine.

‘I was a first time mother so I had no reason to suspect anything was wrong.

‘Then the doctors told me that rather than stay on the ward I could have my own room.

‘At the time I thought this was lovely but now I know it’s because they wanted somewhere private to tell us what was going on.

‘At about three hours old a doctor examined Viola and asked me if I had ever heard of Down’s syndrome.

Mr and Mrs Fuller did not know Viola had Down's syndrome until she was about three hours old

‘I said that I had and he told me he thought Viola had it. He started to point out signs like the extra line on her palm, her small (almond shaped) eyes and her low muscle tone and it suddenly became obvious.

‘The doctor kept speaking but I felt like someone had put a glass wall between us and I couldn’t really see or hear him. It was just so surreal, I felt like I was watching a film.

‘It was the biggest shock of my life, but as the doctor left us with some leaflets he told me to enjoy my baby - those words really stuck with me and they still do now.

‘Whenever I find myself getting frustrated I just think back to that moment and I remind myself how lucky I am to have my daughters.’

Mr Fuller said: 'When Nigella began to crawl, we didn't expect Viola to be able to reach that goal so quickly. But when Viola started crawling too and becoming more mobile, we realised how important Nigella was to her'

Viola attends the same mainstream school as Nigella and the girls' parents say Nigella is always there to look out for her sister

Now, at age six, Viola is in mainstream school with her sister.

Her mother said: ‘Sometimes Viola gets jealous that her sister can do things easier than she can, but they get on very well.

‘They are so close and if Viola ever runs into difficultly at school, Nigella will always be there to help her.

‘For a short time another child was picking on Viola, but Nigella stepped in and told the girl how lovely her sister was.

‘Nigella will always find things easier than her sister, but Viola is high functioning and she’s coming on leaps and bounds.

Speaking of the girls' birth, Mrs Fuller said: 'It was the biggest shock of my life, but as the doctor left us with some leaflets he told me to enjoy my baby - those words really stuck with me and they still do now'

Mrs Fuller said: 'Viola is cheeky, funny, outgoing and has a wonderful confidence that we adore - she rewards and touches everyone that comes into contact with her'

‘They are just like any other six-year-old girls - they love dancing and gymnastics, and swimming, and they’re big fans of Beyoncé.

‘They’re big fans of Disney and think they’re princesses themselves most of the time.

‘Nigella is a very special little girl, and we think she has grown up to be more tolerant, patient and caring than children of her own age.

‘Viola is cheeky, funny, outgoing and has a wonderful confidence that we adore - she rewards and touches everyone that comes into contact with her.

‘We are very proud of both of our girls.'

It is usually expected that children with Down's syndrome will reach milestones, such as crawling, walking and talking

But the girls' parents believe that watching Nigella has helped Viola reach these milestones earlier than she would otherwise have done
