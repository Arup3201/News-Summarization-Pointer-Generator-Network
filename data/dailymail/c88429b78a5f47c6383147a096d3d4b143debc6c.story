A New Jersey man who was drunk stole a bulldozer in order to get a ride home, police say.

Christopher Russell, 30, left behind a path of destruction as he maneuvered the bulldozer through West Hudson Park on Friday night, police say. 

Harrison Police Capt. Mike Green told The Jersey Journal '[Russell] said he was cold and was trying to ride it home to the Ironbound section of Newark.'

Officials told the newspaper that the bulldozer destroyed grass, made tracks in the park and knocked over signs - as well as a number of other items, including three benches, a tree, and a drinking fountain. 

A parked car was hit by the bulldozer after it exited the park, they also said.

Green told The Jersey Journal that Russell was found by police getting out of the bulldozer on a street - and that he told the responding officers he snatched the heavy machinery.

Green also told the newspaper police had said Russell smelled like alcohol.

Green told The Jersey Journal that Russell was charged with driving while intoxicated, criminal mischief, leaving the scene of an accident and theft of the bulldozer.
