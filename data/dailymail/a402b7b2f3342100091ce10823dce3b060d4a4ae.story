Manny Pacquiao has splashed out £8.4million on a luxury new mansion in Beverly Hills, but it was four tickets to the fight against Floyd Mayweather that sealed the deal.

The Filipino boxer acquired the 10,000 square-foot, seven-bedroom property in an exclusive community in California just over a month away from his showdown with the unbeaten American.

As well as the offer of US$12.5m, it was four tickets to one of the biggest fights in boxing history at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2 that struck him the deal.

'No doubt it helped,' Pacquiao's estate agent Elsa Nelson told USA Today Sports. 'The sellers are great fans of boxing and of Manny, so it was a big deal.'

A YouTube video of the property shows the plush interior design as well as the stunning views of the city from the garden, which also features a swimming pool.

According to USA Today Sports, Pacquiao purchased the property on the provision that it came fully furnished and ready to move in.

And it looks like the 36-year-old has already started to spend some of the money he is expected to earn from the $300million battle at the MGM Grand.
