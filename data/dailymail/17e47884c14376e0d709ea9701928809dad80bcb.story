With the 2014 Ryder Cup fast approaching, many are predicting another victory for the Europeans - favourites after winning five of the last six tournaments. 

But perhaps fans shouldn't be getting too comfortable. Here, Sportsmail's Mike Dickson gives five reasons the USA team shouldn't be written off. 

1 Tiger factor

While he is unquestionably a great player it is doubtful whether Tiger’s presence has been a good thing for the team with his aura and the distractions he brings. Was it a coincidence that the last time the USA won was in 2008 when Woods was absent through injury? Tiger not playing possibly changes the team dynamic for the better.

2 Close encounters

While the Europeans have had much the better of it since 1985 the last two matches could have gone either way — both finishing 14½-13½ to Europe. At Celtic Manor in 2010 the Americans had a good run at eradicating a three-point deficit while at Medinah in 2012 the match was stolen from them by a European ‘miracle’ after they had led 10-6.

3 Men on a mission

When Tom Watson announced his captain’s picks it was notable how often the word ‘redemption’ was used. The result from Medinah has haunted the players involved and there is a real sense of them being on a mission to make amends as their ‘Team Redeem’ motto suggests.

4 Home comforts

The weekend weather forecast suggests that the temperatures will not be that hostile to the visitors and there are aspects of the Centenary Course, designed by Jack Nicklaus, which are not totally foreign either. It lies inland, has large man-made bunkers and plenty of water. The country-club vibe should make them feel right at home.

5 European flops

While it turns out Tom Watson has left some in-form players behind, such as Billy Horschel and Chris Kirk, not all of the European side arrive on the back of great recent results. It has been a relatively flat year for Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter while it cannot be certain how rookies Jamie Donaldson and Victor Dubuisson will react.
