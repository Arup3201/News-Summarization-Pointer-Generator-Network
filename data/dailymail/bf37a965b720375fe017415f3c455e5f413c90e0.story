Police were last night hunting Paul Flint after he went on the run for a second time in the space of 13 months

A convicted murderer has gone on the run from jail for a second time and is suspected of carrying out a string of burglaries.

Police were last night hunting Paul Flint, who once killed a man while breaking into a house.

It is the latest in a string of cases of dangerous inmates walking out of low-security jails.

Flint, 48, who was jailed for murder and burglary in 1990, failed to return to Hollesley Bay prison, Suffolk, in June last year after being released temporarily.

He was arrested five days later in Bristol by police using a Taser.

On July 1 this year he walked out of Ford Prison in West Sussex.

Detectives believe he may have since committed at least three burglaries in nearby Brighton and Hove during which more than £2,500 and a laptop were stolen.

They said the 5ft 11in killer, who is black, bespectacled and stocky, should not be approached.

He was found guilty of the murder of John McTurk after attacking him during a burglary in Islington, North London, in 1989.

Last weekend, murderer Daniel Rosenthal, who has paranoid schizophrenia, disappeared after being allowed to go on an unsupervised walk around the gardens at low-security Southfield Hospital in Totton, Hampshire.

The 58-year-old, who was jailed for murder after chopping his mother to pieces in 1981, was not found for almost 24 hours.

Last month, violent robber Mark Donnison, 43, escaped from Hollesley Bay, after being sentenced for absconding from North Sea Camp open prison, Lincolnshire, in August 2012.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We are committed to ensuring risk to the public is minimised.

All those in open conditions have been categorised as being low risk to the public.’
