Reports of two asylum seeker boats on their way to Australian shores last week raised many questions about whether the claims were true, and if the vessels would be the first to reach Australian shores this year.

People want answers about the fate of these boats off Christmas Island, and whether they have been intercepted, but Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has been trying, somewhat unsuccessfully, to keep a lid on the matter.

Speaking to Sky News on Monday, Mr Morrison gave a convoluted and confusing response when asked about the boats - which could potentially be the first to make it to Christmas Island since December 19.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison is still refusing to confirm claims that two asylum seeker boats were intercepted off the cost of Christmas Island

'Public curiosity is not the same as the public interest and the public interest here that I have to assess is what is in the national interest and what is in the national interest is that we maintain the integrity of an operation that is saving lives at sea and protecting the integrity of our borders,' Mr Morrison said - without taking a single breath.

The immigration minister has repeatedly refused to confirm reports over the weekend that two boats were intercepted by Australian authorities off Christmas Island.

One is reportedly carrying 153 Tamil asylum seekers, including about 30 children, many of them sick, while the second is said to have 50 people aboard.

Refugee advocates said they had been in contact with some of those aboard, but had not heard from the Tamil asylum seekers since Saturday.

'I'm fairly convinced the government will rendezvous to get the Sri Lankan navy to tow them back,' Refugee Action Coalition's Ian Rintoul told AAP.

Mr Morrison will only confirm incidents that involve safety of life at sea, such as medical transfers, and has avoided answering any other enquiries.

'There have been no such incidents for me to report over the last few days,' he said.

There are reports that one of the vessels may be travelling from India, but the ABC report that local authorities in India are not aware of any Australia-bound boats leaving their shores.
