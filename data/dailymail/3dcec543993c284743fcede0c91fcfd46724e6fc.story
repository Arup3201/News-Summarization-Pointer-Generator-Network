Up to 3.8million credit card frauds have been left out of the survey, along with murders, rapes and crimes against children

Millions of card fraud cases are left out of official figures, making a ‘mockery’ of Government figures that crime is falling, it was claimed yesterday.

Damning research shows up to 3.8million bank and credit card frauds are left out of the Crime Survey for England and Wales, distorting the true scale of offending.

If they were included, the number of annual offences would rise by 50 per cent, from the record low of 7.3million to 11million a year. It means seven people are defrauded every minute.

For the annual survey, the Office for National Statistics conducts face-to-face interviews with 40,000 people to glean their experiences of crime.

But as well as many frauds, it excludes murder and manslaughter because the victim is dead, figures about rape and other sex offences which are calculated differently due to their sensitive nature, and crimes such as drug possession that are considered victimless.

The ONS was criticised last night after it revealed the 3.8million frauds were not in its survey. Card frauds alone were said to be worth £450million last year.

It was accused of failing to follow new trends as criminals turn to online fraud and other cyber crimes – such as credit card fraud, bogus online auctions and online dating scams – that often carry softer punishments.

But ONS statisticians said it was difficult to be confident about the scale of plastic card fraud because victims often do not report it, or it is counted twice or more by different bodies such as banks and insurers.

The estimate of the scale of card and banking fraud, which would make it the second biggest area of crime after theft, was slipped out last month.

Professor Marion FitzGerald, a criminologist at the University of Kent, said: ‘Ministers were readily persuaded that the Crime Survey represented a gold standard for measuring crime when it started to show a continuous fall from the time Labour took office in 1997. Yet here we have an admission from its own results that crime is 50 per cent higher than the figure it claims.’

Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘Public confidence in crime figures is vital and requires recording the full range of crimes consistently. 

'It is a mockery for a reputable crime survey to fail to count almost one in three offences.’

Labour’s policing spokesman Jack Dromey said: ‘If a member of the public is robbed, online or on the street, they are robbed and that should be recorded.’

The survey showed 211,344 frauds were recorded by police in England and Wales in the 12 months to the end of March, a rise of 17 per cent. 

There were also 333,600 frauds reported by the financial and retail sectors.

John Flatley, of the ONS, said when it began the survey in the Eighties fraud was not a high-value offence, adding: ‘With the internet, fraud has exploded. In the past it was a long process to con money out of someone.’

Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said: ‘It is incorrect to suggest the Government has overlooked the scale of economic crime. We are committed to tackling fraud.’
