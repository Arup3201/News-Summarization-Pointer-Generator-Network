A sickness bug has left at least 100 British tourists ill, with several on drips after it swept through an Egyptian holiday resort.

Holidaymakers at the Coral Sea Waterworld complex have been affected by the bug, thought to be Shigella, which causes diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever.

People staying at the four star resort in Sharm el Sheikh say some tourists have been confined to their rooms during the majority of their stay at the hotel, with some on intravenous drips.

Many of those affected have blamed the outbreak on poor hygiene and dirty utensils and buffet containers.

It has also been reported that extra doctors have been drafted in to cope with the sickness outbreak and that staff at the resort are now wearing latex gloves and using hand sanitisers.

According to the Daily Mirror, legal firm Simpson Millar, acting for the holidaymakers staying at the hotel, say there had been 50 cases of the illness reported to them in the past 24 hours alone.

Tourists staying at the resort have also been taking to the hotel's TripAdvisor page, where many complain that the bug had ruined their holiday.

Tim308 posted: 'All was fine until the Tuesday when I was struck down with sickness and diarrhoea for 3 days.Â  Just as I was recovering from my illness my wife was struck down with one far worst, sickness, diarrhoea, stomach cramps and fever that continued for the duration of our holiday and is still not 100 per cent now.

'Instead of enjoying the second week around the water park or on the beach we were confined to the room or trips to the pharmacist for antibiotics and an injection.'

While Bristol S posted: 'I became ill on the second night and was unable to eat, drink, use the pools or waterpark for the whole holiday.

'I had 2 drips, injections, antibiotics, tablets coming out of my ears and medicine. I have to mention the on site doctors, although you pay for this service, they were amazing and totally run off their feet!'

A spokeswoman from First Choice Holidays told the newspaper: 'We are aware of a small number of cases of sickness at the hotel in Egypt with symptoms similar to a virus.

'Reported cases of sickness have reduced and an independent health and safety consultant has been undertaking a thorough investigation.'

Earlier this month, research showed that the top reasons British people had to put in a medical claim on their holiday insurance was for stomach bugs.

The top destination for the most claims was Spain closely followed by Egypt.
