A controversial painting of a topless Angelina Jolie after her recent double mastectomy has been unveiled.

The portrait, painted by artist Johan Andersson, is expected to fetch over £15,000 after going on display in a Los Angeles art gallery.

Angelina Jolie underwent the life changing surgery in February after she discovered she carried the same gene which caused her mother Marcheline Bertrand’s ovarian cancer.

Mr Andersson, one of the youngest ever artists to be exhibited at the National Portrait gallery, said his own mother's struggle with breast cancer inspired the oil painting.

Swedish Mr Andersson made a name for himself through highly commended portraits of singer Amy Winehouse and ex-dictator of Libya Muammar Gaddaffi.

He said: ‘My mother had aggressive breast cancer when I was 15, the thought of her having to have a mastectomy really scared me and she was fortunate enough to have surgery without the mastectomy.

‘The recent news about Angelina stirred an anxiety within me leading me to paint this portrait. There is an underlying awkwardness in her demeanour in juxtaposition to the natural beauty of her face.’

The Oscar-winning actress underwent the 
surgery after learning he carried the BRCA1 gene mutation that doctors 
estimated gave her an 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer.

Loss: Angelina Jolie's mother Marcheline Bertrand died in 2007 after a six-year battle with ovarian cancer

Angelina’s mother Marcheline Bertrand fought a six-year battle against ovarian cancer, which took her life aged 56.

Angelina, 37, is now expected to have a hysterectomy and an oophorectomy, where the ovaries are removed, to combat her raised odds of developing ovarian cancer, which stand at 50 per cent.Angelina and Brad Pitt have six children, Maddox, 11, Pax, nine, Zahara, eight, Shiloh, six, and four-year-old twins, Knox and Vivienne. The three eldest are adopted while the three youngest are the couple’s biological children.

Johan Andersson is the youngest artist ever to be short-listed for the BP Portrait Award, which also makes him one of the youngest artists ever to be exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery.

Proceeds from the sale of the painting will go to the Falling Whistles charity that campaigns for peace in the Congo, a cause which Angelina Jolie is passionate about.
