The entire West Bromwich Albion team is on trial for their futures, according to Chris Brunt, who says Tony Pulis has ‘stamped his authority’ immediately.

Brunt concedes some players might benefit from a ‘kick up the a***’ from Pulis and likens the new head coach to Roy Hodgson.

‘When a new manager comes in he may bring somebody in out of the cold that wasn’t playing who he thinks can maybe do a better job,’ said Brunt.

‘Football is all about opinions and one person may think you are better than somebody else at certain things.

‘Maybe the new manager will just give a few players a kick up the a*** to try and get them moving again. He has definitely come in and stamped his authority.

‘He is definitely in total control when it comes to training. There are not going to be any grey areas. I think we will definitely be a lot more disciplined around the place.’

Brunt compared Pulis to the current England boss, who was in charge at West Brom between 2011 and 2012. 

‘They are very hands on, a lot of tactical stuff,’ said Brunt. ‘They talk and walk people around the proper positions that he is after. It is very similar to what Roy Hodgson brought for the first few months after he came.

‘At the end of the day if we are all drilled and know what each other is doing it is pretty predictable and is going to be easier to help each other out.

‘Sometimes if we lack a little bit of quality in certain areas you can make up for it with team work. When Roy was manager that was definitely a big part of our game. I am sure the way the new manager is talking that is going to be a massive help to us.’
