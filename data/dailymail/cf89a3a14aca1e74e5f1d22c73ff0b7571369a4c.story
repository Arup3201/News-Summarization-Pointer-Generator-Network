A first date took a dramatic turn for the worse for a Florida women when her potential suitor ended the evening by pulling a gun on her and stealing her car.

Nimeha Milien says she had never met Donald McGee, 19, before Friday evening when he started to send her text messages about meeting for a date.

Within a few hours McGee had convinced her to drive to meet him at the intersection of Sheridan Street and 68th Avenue in Hollywood, Florida.

McGee initially told Milien that he wanted to go back to her place. She refused and instead she drove them to Palm Beach County, where they took a romantic walk on the beach at Ocean Inlet Park.

'We sat there. We spoke. Nothing wrong happened,' Milien told WPBF News. 'It was like normal, all conversation.'

Milien agreed to drop McGee at a Wendy's parking lot on Boynton Beach Boulevard, where she thought his brother was going to collect him.

Instead McGee pulled out out a .380-caliber Kel Tec handgun and told her to get out of the car.

According to Milien, McGee then drove away and she ran across the street to a gas station where she asked a customer for help.

The customer told her to get in his car so they could follow McGee, while she called 911.

Officers caught up with McGee on Interstate 95 and chased him for about eight miles.

The chase ended on the Yamato Road on-ramp after McGee lost control of the vehicle and got it stuck in the dirt and grass.

After a brief attempt to flee, McGee was arrested and charged with armed carjacking, robbery with a firearm, possession of marijuana, driving without a license, and fleeing police. He is currently locked up at Palm Beach County Jail

Milien, who turned 21 on Monday, said she will not be dating anytime soon.

â€˜I'm glad that I'm alive to be able to see my 21st birthday because I want to be able to make a difference in this world,' she said.

'If I had died on that night, I wouldn't have done anything.'
