Jamie Carragher has heaped praise on David Silva after the playmaker dazzled in Manchester City's win against Aston Villa on Saturday.

City scored two late goals through Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero to secure all three points at Villa Park.

But Carragher says Silva was the architect, and believes he is up there with the best foreign Premier League players of all time.

'One player you would love to watch, no matter who you support- it would be him,' Carragher said on Sky Sports.

'Couple of other Spaniards like him - (Santi) Cazorla and (Juan) Mata - he's two or three levels above them. You never see him get tackled, you can't get near him.

'His awareness is the best in world football, (Andres) Iniesta and Xavi are the nearest level to him. He's something special.'

And Carragher also tweeted after the game: 'Best 2 foreigners were Henry and Ronaldo then there is a list of 10/12 Silva right in the mix with other foreign greats.'

Silva arrived from Valencia for fee of £25million in 2010, and has made 141 appearances in the Premier League.

His style of play helped Manuel Pellegrini to a maiden title last season, while he is a key member of the Spain squad.
