Desperate: Tabber Benedict, 35, even threw himself a lavish farewell party as he awaited sentencing

A Manhattan socialite was so desperate to protect his reputation that he pretended he was going on a long vacation to Europe, when he was in fact he was preparing to pack his bags and head to jail.

Tabber Benedict, 35, even threw himself a lavish farewell party as he awaited sentencing for a drunken car crash which nearly killed a high school teacher.

But now his web of lies has been laid bare much to his friends' surprise.

On January 28 the finance lawyer was sentenced to as many as 10 years in jail, reported the New York Post.

But four days earlier he threw a lavish going-away party at  Chelsea’s Bungalow 8 with 150 guests.

As his guests sipped champagne and he partied with beautiful women, he boasted of his upcoming holiday.

'He lied to everybody about going to Europe,' one of his friends said.

It
wasn’t until later that one friend 'heard that [Benedict] was making 
something up' and that only a few people 'did know the truth.'

But the party was to be the last of Benedict's for the foreseeable future.

On July 4  2011 Benedict was drinking at a friend’s house in the Hamptons when his girlfriend demanded he come see her in Manhattan, his lawyer said.

He took to the road in his SUV at 8 a.m -  more than three times over the legal limit, law enforcement sources said.

He then hit Southampton lifeguard and teacher Steve Dorn was biking on the Montauk Highway near East Quogue.

Benedict then fled the scene as the father-of-three daughters lay severely injured along the highway, court records show.

Mr. Benedict then hit another car and drove for two miles before being stopped by two motorists who witnessed the accident and used their vehicles to block in his 2011 GMC Acadia prosecutors said.

Mr Dorn, 44, was admitted to Brookhaven Memorial Hospital in critical condition at the time of the accident.

After a battle to recover from his injuries, Mr Dorn has only recently returned to 
work in the William Floyd School District as a physical education 
teacher.

'I
have a nine-inch laceration from my back that goes to my stomach, which
we have as a lifelong reminder that I was almost killed that day,' Mr Dorn
told the court, records show.

Mr Dorn also criticised Benedict for not apologizing until they met in court.

'I am so sorry for what I did to your family, what I did to Mr. Dorn, his wife and your children and how I impacted you,' said Benedict according to court records.

Benedict pleaded guilty to 10 
total charges — including aggravated vehicular assault, DWI, and leaving
the scene of an accident — and was disbarred from practicing law.

He was given a three to 10-year sentence for aggravated vehicular assault at an upstate prison.

His mother wrote a letter to the court to beg for leniency citing his humble upbringing in East Greenbush, a town right outside Albany.

The socialite was recently featured in a New York Observer story and spoke of his childhood.

He recalled working jobs at grocery stores and McDonald’s throughout high school while being raised by a single mom.

'I literally was using foodstamps,' he said.

He won a scholarship to Colgate while working in the school library, then went to Columbia Law School and put in time at White & Case and The ACE Group before eventually launching his own firm.

On his website he boasts of his charitable contributions that have 
'led him to be an active supporter and volunteer for several 
charities--including New Yorkers For Children, Best Buddies, the Avon 
Walk for Breast Cancer and several others.'
