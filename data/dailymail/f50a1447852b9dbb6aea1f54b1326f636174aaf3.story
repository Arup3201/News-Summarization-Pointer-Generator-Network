Charles Ukachukwu Imoh was jailed for four years

A German man has been jailed after being caught trying to smuggle more than £200,000 worth of cocaine in 83 packages in his body. 

Charles Ukachukwu Imoh was stopped by police at Dover's Eastern Docks after telling officials he was visiting family in London having boarded a coach from Frankfurt. 

The 57-year-old, who is also has a Nigerian passport, was X-rayed at hospital where 83 packages were found in his body. 

Imoh, from Essen, was arrested and pleaded guilty to drug smuggling at Canterbury Crown Court last month. 

He was jailed for four years which, under the UK Borders Act 2007, means he will face automatic deportation.  

When tested, the drugs had a purity level of 66 per cent, and an estimated street value of more than £215,000.   

Paul Morgan, Director of Border Force South East and Europe said: 'Drug trafficking is a serious offence and those convicted will face prison sentences. 

'Our message to those who would consider it is that it’s just not worth it.

'Border Force officers will continue to work diligently to keep our border secure and to make life as tough as possible for those who seek to profit from this evil trade.'
