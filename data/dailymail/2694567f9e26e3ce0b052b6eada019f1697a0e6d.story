The chairman of the Essendon Football Club, Paul Little, has finally sold his Queensland home after putting it on the market in 2011. 

But the five bedroom five bathroom home, complete with a private cinema, was sold for a $1.1 million loss. 

Little first bought the house at 17 Witta Circle in Noosa Heads in 2007 for $7.6 million according to Property Observer.

The chairman of the Essendon Football Club, Paul Little, finally sold his Queensland home on Monday 

The two-storey property at Noosa was sold to a Brisbane couple for $6.5 million

The two-storey water-front mansion was sold for only $6.5 million on Monday to a Brisbane couple.

Featuring its own section of private beach and a jetty, the mansion is also complete with its own luxurious swimming pool. 

Its modern design includes a number of open living spaces and sky lights as well as a Balinese open room and sandstone terraces.

The selling price was a $1.1 million loss for Mr Little, who bought the property for $7.6 million in 2007

Despite the million dollar loss, the sale has been dubbed an example of the rising confidence in Noosa's property market

Despite appearing to be a great loss for the high-end property, the sale has been dubbed an example of the rising confidence in Noosa's property market which suffered greatly during the financial crisis, according to the Financial Review. 

Unlike the Sydney and Melbourne markets which recovered fairly quickly, Queensland's coastal market is yet to make a strong recovery. 

The loss is one of many struggles currently being endured by Mr Little, whose AFL club's players are facing the prospect of suspensions after they lost a court battle with Australia's anti-doping authority over its supplements program last month.

The open plan living spaces, sky lights and the north facing position of the house means it is showered in sunlight all year round 

The club has until October 1 to appeal the findings and have been ordered to pay ASADA's court costs. 

On Monday Mr Little also revealed that James Hird will keep his job as Essendon's senior coach despite rumours of his sacking.

In a statement, the chairman wrote that it would be 'potentially reckless' to make any significant decisions until there is 'further clarity' on some ongoing issues.
