An Arizona high school has sparked outrage from civil rights leaders after it held a 'Redneck Day' for students.

Yesterday's school-wide event at Queen Creek High School was designed to satirize a reality TV show called 'Duck Dynasty,' school officials said.

But the day's questionable title has offended some students, parents and local African-American and civil rights leaders who claim it serves as grim reminders of slavery and segregation.

According to the Arizona Republic, one student wore a large Confederate flag to school, which particularly upset critics.

'We all know the connotation of "redneck," Rev. Ozetta Kirby, pastor of Holy Trinity Community AME Church in nearby Mesa told the newspaper.

He added that the day 'really got to' his 16-year-old grandson, Marcus, who attends the school.

Steve Montoya, a prominent civil-rights attorney in Phoenix, said the Confederate flag was the most offensive part.

He told the Arizona Republic: 'The Confederacy represents the horrible institution of slavery, and that is a direct attack on African-Americans.'

Tom Lindsey, the superintendent of the Queen Creek Unified School District, said the only intent of 'Redneck Day' was to spoof the characters on the reality show, which follows a family of duck hunters in Louisiana.

He said the student wearing the Confederate flag wasn't from Arizona and didn't appreciate the reaction the flag would receive.

The boy was pulled aside and asked to change his clothes by an assistant principal and the meaning of the flag in Arizona was explained to him.

'We apologize to any people who, because of the word (redneck), were offended,' Lindsey said.
