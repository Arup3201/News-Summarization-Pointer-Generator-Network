Former England captain Rio Ferdinand runs the rule over England's most threatening opponents from a group containing Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica... and how to stop them at the World Cup.

A brilliant nuisance! England's best hope of stopping Luis Suarez is to let him make his move first and then react

The man is a nuisance. A brilliant nuisance, but an absolute pain because he never stops running at you. Every time he gets the ball, he asks you questions as a defender.

He has an uncanny way of playing that I’ve never seen before — trying to run the ball through you, either with a nutmeg or by kicking the ball at your legs knowing you won’t expect it, and he then picks up the ricochet. And when he’s past you and in sight of goal he pulls the trigger.

Will he, won't he? Luis Suarez is facing a race against time to be fit for the World Cup following knee surgery

As defenders we always move our feet, it’s like a mantra. Feet. Position. Read the opponent. Move. Having the ball kicked at your feet is confusing! The way to stop him is to let him make his move and, aware he’ll perhaps try to knock it past, take it away. But it’s not easy. He’s a livewire, a fan of the feint and shot, and dangerous from many positions.

As a defender, I’d normally be  25-30 yards away from Pirlo’s sphere of operations as the heartbeat of his club and country. But having faced him and watched him up close for many years, I know he can put the ball on a sixpence from anywhere.

Italy's heartbeat: Andrea Pirlo's can be stopped by sitting on him and not allowing him to to distribute the ball

I’m always thinking of the space behind me when he’s on the field because if the opposition have a runner down the channels — Mario Balotelli for Italy, for example, who gave England the runaround at Euro 2012 — then the runner is Pirlo’s moving target. And he rarely misses.

Pirlo is awesomely good and can slice you open with a kick. From 50 yards he can send a killer ball behind a defence. That combination of a runner in behind and the laser ball are a nightmare to defend. So how do you stop him? You sit on him! You stop him getting the ball or block him distributing it. Easier said than done.

Left-footed Berbatov: England should not take Costa Rica forward Bryan Ruiz for granted in Brazil

There’s a truism of no easy games in football and that’s never more true than the World Cup. So England can’t take anything for granted against Costa Rica and their major threat, if firing, will be Ruiz.

He’s undoubtedly talented, a left-footed Berbatov almost. Great technique and stronger than he looks.
