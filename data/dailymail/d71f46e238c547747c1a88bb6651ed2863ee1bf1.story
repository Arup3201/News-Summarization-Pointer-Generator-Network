Manchester United and Tottenham target Memphis Depay could leave PSV Eindhoven in the summer, the club's director has admitted.

The 21-year-old, a Holland international, attracted interest after impressing at the World Cup in Brazil, with Tottenham even tabling a €20million (£14.6m) bid for the forward, which was turned down.

But PSV director Toon Gerbrands is resigned to the fact that he is likely to leave when the next transfer window opens in June.

'Tottenham were willing to offer €20m for Depay,' he told Dutch broadcaster NOS. 'We decided to keep hold of him, but he has the option to leave after this season.'

Depay and PSV colleague Georginio Wijnaldum are expected to attract a number of high-profile suitors, with the latter being eyed up by Paris Saint-Germain.

'I think these two players are very attractive to a lot of clubs in Europe,' Gerbrands continued. 'So far, no-one has come forward with an offer but I expect we will come under great pressure.'

Depay turned down a move to Tottenham last summer, but could leave for England in the next window

Depay is familiar with current Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal due to their time spent together with Holland, and reports in the summer stated that the player's decision to stay with PSV was heavily influenced by Van Gaal.

Therefore, Depay's decision on which club to choose if he does leave PSV may be swayed by Van Gaal and Manchester United, who also have Depay's international team-mate Daley Blind in their ranks.

The forward has scored 21 goals in 31 appearances in all competitions this season.
