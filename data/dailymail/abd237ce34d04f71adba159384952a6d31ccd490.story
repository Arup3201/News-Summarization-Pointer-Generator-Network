Rosamund Pike, Felicity Jones and Julianne Moore dazzled on the red carpet at Sunday night's star-studded Oscar awards.

But you can be sure that their cashmere complexions, perfect rouge pouts and subtle smokey eyes weren't the result of a quick beautifying session in the back of their cabs on the way there.

As celebrity make-up artist Aimee Adams - who has painted the famous faces of everyone from Helen Mirren to Sienna Miller via Michael Fassbender - explains, getting ready for the Oscars is a complex and time-consuming process. 

FEMAIL were keen to learn exactly how the stars get red carpet ready, so we called on Aimee to talk us through how she beautifies the  stars for Tinseltown's glittering awards ceremonies. 

Celebrity make-up artist Aimee Adams - who has painted the famous faces of everyone from Helen Mirren to Sienna Miller via Michael Fassbender - explained to FEMAIL what a complex process getting ready for the Oscars is. She tested out her tips and tricks on Deborah Ann Gaetano, 37, of Buckinghamshire, pictured, left, before, and, right, after having an A-list worthy make-over

She then recreated celebrity looks on four women, capturing before and after shots of the ladies - and the results are amazing.

'The stars are under intense scrutiny to look at their best on the red carpet,' explained Aimee. 'And many of them spend millions of pounds on facials and hair treatments in the run up to the event, so they're not going to rush their make-up.'

Aimee emphasises that the prep is just as important as the make-up, and she advises her clients to have regular laser facials in the run up to the event. 

'The Oscars beauty look isn't trends-led,' she said. 'It's like a wedding day, stars just want to look the best versions of themselves, so dewy, pared-back skin rules.'

Dani McCormack, 26, a PR from London, was also treated to an Oscar-worthy makeover

Aimee achieves this flawless complexion with a careful skin prep regime. On the night of the awards, she recommends using a full mask to hydrate the skin before applying make-up. 'My clients enjoy these steps, it's like a home spa,' she said.

She preps their skin with a primer (she loves Smashbox) and often mixes it with a foundation to ensure it doesn't look too heavy or cakey on camera.

She adapts each look to the particular client based on their needs and preferences; but the secret behind every flawless red carpet look? Lighting.

'I use head torches, LED light panels and SAD lighting because it's essential to see how it all looks in different situations,' she explained. 'I always check contouring in a dark room and use a magnifying mirror in bright light to check lips and eyes. 

'When Angelina Jolie had that white make-up fail, it was probably because her make-up artist dusted silica matte powder over her face in poor lighting.'

On the night of the awards, she recommends using a full mask to hydrate the skin before applying make-up and suggests getting regular facial lasers to keep redness and acne at bay. Amrit Maghera, 31, models the results

For the more mature woman like Helen Mirren, who Aimee has worked with, she says skin maintenance is key.

'Helen is beautiful and she's never had work done, she just looks after her skin and always has,' she said.

'For women with skin like Helen's, it's essential to use lighter formulas that won't settle into lines; and emphasising eyebrows to add definition is key.'

As for her male clients, who have included Colin Firth and Tom Ford, she swears by a brand called le maquillage pro - and is convinced Brad Pitt and 'most male celebrities' do too.

'Men are actually fussier than women,' she said. 'But less is more. For men, it's important to use a wax-based make-up because it's much more subtle.'   

Aimee created these beauty looks in collaboration with Sony as they launched their 4K TV. Whilst HD make-up has been on the lips of every beauty buff for a while, 4K TV broadcasts in more detail than ever before.

Aimee said: 'The advent of 4K technology means one thing for our Hollywood beauties, a spotlight on their imperfections!

'This makes the prep, as well as the actually make-up application, extremely important. This year’s Oscar certainly relied on these techniques to keep them camera-ready, so I am delighted to share my secrets with other women.’
