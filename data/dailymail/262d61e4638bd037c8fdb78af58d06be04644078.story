Your money is no good here: Hans Christian Holte, director general of taxation in Norway, say Bitcoin is not a currency

The fortunes of Bitcoins continue to fluctuate after the Norwegian government announced that is does not count as real money.

The virtual currency has left governments throughout the world scratching their heads as it is not controlled by a government or any central bank.

But a government offical in Norway, Scandinavia's richest nation, is the latest to express doubts over the legitimacy of Bitcoins.

'Bitcoins don’t fall under the usual definition of money or currency,' Hans Christian Holte, director general of taxation in Norway, said.

Instead, Norway will classify Bitcoins as an asset, subject to capital gains tax.

'We’ve done some assessments on what’s the right and sound way to handle this in the tax system,' he added.

Paul Ehling, associate professor in the department of financial economics at the BI Norwegian Business School, said the government’s definition of money may be too restrictive, reports Bloomberg.

'Currency is any agreed upon means of exchanges of goods and services, so you could have some small stones, as used in history, and if it’s accepted by a sufficiently large population, then that’s enough,' Ehling said.

'These days we do mean that a much larger group of people is willing to exchange goods or services for this currency.'

The value of Bitcoins plunged earlier this month after the Chinese government questioned the legal status of the virtual currency.

A joint statement from several Chinese official bodies such as the People's Bank of China said Bitcoins are not a currency and cannot be used as a form of payment by any businesses or financial institutions.

Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer 
digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as 
the Bank of England.

The currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers.

Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy.

But critics say that also makes Bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities.

A
 Bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, recently made more than 
half a million pounds after he forgot he bought £17 of currency four 
years ago.

The central bank of France also weighed in on the Bitcoin impasse, warning investors that the unregulated currency could pose financial and legal risks for those who hold it, MarketWatch reported. Germany said it will impose tax on the virtual currency.

However, analysts with Bank of America's Merrill Lynch came out on the side of Bitcoin, saying in a report that came out Friday that the crypto-currency (so-called because it uses encryption as a security measure) become a significant tool for those purchasing products online.

Bitcoins have also received several boosts in recent months with illegal trading platforms closed and the U.S. senate considering the potential use of the currency.

Bitcoin is an open source, peer-to-peer payment network and digital currency introduced in 2008.

The
 first step in owning and spending bitcoins is setting up a digital 
wallet. This is a piece of software that can be downloaded to your 
desktop, accessed online or used as an app. It contains a code for 
receiving bitcoins and a separate code for spending them.

The
 Pembury Tavern pub in Hackney, London, was the first to accept bitcoins
 and in October the world's first bitcoin ATM went online in Vancouver, 
Canada.

It scans a user's palm before letting them buy or sell bitcoins for cash.
