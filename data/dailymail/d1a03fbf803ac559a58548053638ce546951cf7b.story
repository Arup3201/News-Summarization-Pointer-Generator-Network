The doctor whose wife and two daughters were raped and murdered in a horrific home invasion in 2007 has welcomed a baby son into his life.

Dr William Petit's second wife Christine gave birth to a baby boy on Saturday at 6.24am - one week earlier than its due date of December 3.

They will call the baby William Petit III after his father and grandfather.

The couple met at the doctor's local country club, when Christine offered to volunteer for the Petit Family Foundation, which was created in the memory of his wife Jennifer Hawke-Petit and their daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela.

Good news: The couple met while Christine was volunteering for the Petit Family Foundation, created in the memory of William's wife Jennifer Hawke-Petit and their daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11

Joy: Christine Petit (second left) and her husband, Dr William Petit, announced in August they are expecting their first child together as they looked after William's niece

First picture: Christine said back in August that her husband insisted that the baby's foot seen in ultrasound images looks like a 'boy foot'

The family was held hostage for hours
 at their Cheshire, Connecticut, home before it was set alight by Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky.

Dr Petit 
was severely beaten and dumped in the basement but managed to escape.

He and Christine, a professional photographer, announced shortly before their first wedding anniversary on August 5 that they were expecting a child. Messages of congratulations flooded into Dr Petit's Twitter page in the last 24 hours.

When local news station WFSB interviewed the couple, Petit said he was very excited about the prospect of a new baby, and that he is ready to start changing diapers again.

Responding to the reporter's question about starting a family again, Dr Petit turned somber, saying ‘children are always your jewels'.

‘Children are the hope for the future,’ he said with a catch in his throat, adding that most parents aim to teach children how to be good people and help others.

After
 the years of darkness that William Petit lived through in the aftermath
 of his family's massacre, the bereaved husband and father was craving 
light - his new wife stepped in to brighten his life in every way 
possible.

Dr William Petit headed down the aisle with new love Christine Paluf last August, five years after he was the lone survivor of the brutal home invasion that left his wife and daughters dead

Petit met at a local country club in 2008, where she worked as a marketing director. After they got chatting, she offered her professional photography services to the foundation.

In April, she released pictures of their new home and life together and explained how they have found peace in Western Connecticut.

When the killers went on trial in 2011, Christine was there for Petit, sitting behind him in the courthouse along with his relatives and listening to hours of agonizing testimony.

Last year they got married and moved into a small but cozy home in Farmington River in western Connecticut.

The
 Petits painted the walls of the living room white, and Christine 
filled the cozy space with cheerful purple and lavender touches, as well
 as a large white dandelion-shaped chandelier.

'This
 was all dark. All dark. Then she put these funky lights in. Put a new 
floor in, got rid of some furniture,' Dr Petit told Esquire Magazine at the time.

In
 the years after the murders, the former endocrinologist dreaded the 
night and all the traumatic memories and irrational fears that would 
creep into his mind in the dark.

But
 now, with the calm, reassuring presence of his new wife by his side, 
Petit has learned to welcome the hour when he retires to bed every 
night.

However, he 
still counts the days, hours and minutes since his daughters died in the
 worst way imaginable.

Power of love: Dr William Petit credits his new wife, Christina Paluf, with helping him every day and night deal with the trauma of the 2007 tragedy that has robbed him of his family

Woman's touch: The Petits painted the walls of the living room white, and Christine filled the cozy room with cheerful purple and lavender touches, as well as a large white dandelion-shaped chandelier

They shared their emotional wedding ceremony last year with 300 family and friends, before moving into their quaint new home.

They chose to sleep in the smaller bedroom rather than the master bedroom because it faced the water - bringing with it the view and peace they crave.

It is a new home away from the Cheshire home William shared with his wife Jennifer for 18 years, where his daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, grew up. And also the place were they breathed their last breaths.

William has not returned there since that fateful Sunday in July 2007.

Michaela and her 17-year-old sister, Hayley, 
were tied to their beds and died of smoke inhalation after the house was
 doused in gas and set on fire

Scorched: The house was set alight with the girls still inside, tied up with pillowcases over their heads

Horror: An image shown to the court shows the charred bedroom of Hayley Petit after the attack

William quit practicing medicine after the horrific incident and has now dedicated his life to the foundation.

He was approached last month about running for Congress and told reporters he was considering it after having talks with Republican Party officials.

He is continually touched by those who have reached out to him and donated their money, time and kindness.

After the home invasion, 25,000 pieces of mail came from all over the world. Some sent money for the foundation, a dollar bill, a $5,000 check, a handwritten note, a card.

They were all answered, even when there were no return addresses, the Petits found them.

The donations still come in. Among one of William's favorites, according to Esquire magazine, are from three little brothers who, every year at their birthday parties, ask friends to make a donation to the foundation instead of buying a present.

William thinks people understand the mission statement - to foster the education of young people, especially women in the sciences, to improve the lives of those affected by chronic illnesses and to support efforts to protect and help those affected by violence.

The house burned down beyond any salvation, the building and its foundation had to be razed and carted away. Residents of the affluent cul-de-sac turned it into a memorial garden - though William never goes there.
