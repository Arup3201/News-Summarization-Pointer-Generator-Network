Brawl: Footballer Nicky Morgan has been left paralysed from the waist down

A footballer may be paralysed from the waist down after a vicious 10-man brawl outside a nightclub.

Nicky Morgan, 25, is believed to have hit the his head on a
kerb during the fight behind the Sugar Hut club in Brentwood, Essex, in
the early hours of Friday morning.

The club regularly features in the hit TV show The Only Way Is Essex.

The former West Ham player, who plays in goal for Ryman League side Billericay Town, was taken to Queen's Hospital, in Romford, Essex.

It is not known if Morgan, from Loughton, Essex, had been in the club before the incident.

News of Morgan's horrific injuries left his teammates in shock before their 4-2 victory against local rivals Canvey Island, a win dedicated to him.

Craig Edwards, Billericay's manager, said: 'We are all still in shock. He is a diamond geezer to work with and so far this season he has been our most consistent player.

'He was really missed on Saturday just because his presence was not there in the changing room, in the tunnel and on the pitch.

'I spoke to his father on Friday and 
at the moment he is paralysed from the waist down and on one side and 
will probably stay in intensive care well into next week.

'We are all just hoping he can recover and live a normal life, whether that is in football or not.'

Paul Halsey, the goalkeeping coach at Billericay, said Morgan was only just getting to the best of his abilities as a player.

He said: 'Losing Nicky like this is terrible as he has been outstanding so far this season.

'I have done a lot of work with him this year and I am just devastated, it has really affected me.'

An
Essex Police spokeswoman said: 'Officers are looking at CCTV but 
believe an altercation may have taken place involving around 10 men.'

A spokesman for the club said last night that Morgan had improved slightly.

'He has movement in his arms and toes but cannot move his legs,' he said.

'He is having an operation tomorrow to reduce swelling. It's too early to assess the full extent of his injuries.

'His parents would like to thank everyone for their kind messages and support.'
