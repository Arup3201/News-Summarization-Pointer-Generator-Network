A British shopkeeper's daughter who has become a household name in India hasn't forgotten her roots. 

Geeta Basra, 30, has starred in three major Bollywood films. But when she's not on a set or the red carpet, she's happy to help out at her parents' newsagents in Portsmouth.

Her father said his customers have no idea they are being served by a star. He said: 'None of my customers know I have a famous daughter - we keep it very quiet.

Success: Geeta Basra has starred in three Bollywood films and has more in the pipeline

'We see all walks of life, being near the dockyards, university and schools, and none of them know we are Geeta's parents.' 

Geeta was born and raised in Portsmouth and moved to Mumbai at the age of 18 to pursue her dream of becoming an actress.

Realised her dream: The 30-year-old grew up in Portsmouth and always wanted to be a Bollywood star

She first fell in love with Bollywood films as a toddler and began dancing and singing when she was just two-years-old.

But despite her passion for the musicals, she never dreamed that she would make it onto the big screen and star in her own Bollywood films.

She said: 'I've been a huge fan of Indian films forever. I've always wanted to be a part of it but because I'm from Portsmouth I never thought it would be possible.

'It was just a dream. For me to take that decision to stop my education for a while, to put it on hold, was a huge thing.

'I wanted to go to Mumbai and pursue my dreams even though I didn't know anyone here. I'm living a dream. I thank God and my parents - I couldn't be anything in life without my parents' support.'

Back home: The actress returns to Portsmouth regularly to see her family and help out in their shop

Living the dream: Geeta gave up her plans to become a criminal psychologist to become a Bollywood star

Geeta gave up her plans to become a criminal psychologist to follow in the footsteps of her Bollywood idol actress Madhuri Dixit.

She explained: 'After my studies I decided to go to India and give acting a shot. It's a competitive place and you need to be headstrong to get somewhere - like any other career.

'But I went to an acting school in India and then got an agent. I was very lucky and I really enjoyed it.' 

She landed her first role in Dil Diya Hai (I Have Given My Heart) in 2006, which grossed 550million Indian Rupees in Box Office earnings (5m British pounds).

She has since starred in The Train and her latest film is Mr Joe B. Carvalho.

She has also appeared in a music video and will shortly be starting filming for two movies, one in Hindi and a regional one in Punjabi.

But she still finds time to help out at her family's Stop and Go corner shop in her home town.

Her father, Rakesh, and mother, Parveen, have run the store in Portsmouth for 23 years. 

Geeta and her siblings, Ruby, 27, and Rahul, 20, all grew up spending their summer holidays serving customers.

Geeta said she's proud of her roots and loves spending time at home. She said: 'I was born and bred in Portsmouth, I went to school here and this will always be my home.

'I'm proud to be from Portsmouth and love this city. I love going to the seafront and all the greenery we have. It's all a lot more calm and peaceful compared to hectic Mumbai.' 

She added: 'I know my grandfather Ved Prakash Basra is very proud of me - he's a huge Bollywood buff.'
