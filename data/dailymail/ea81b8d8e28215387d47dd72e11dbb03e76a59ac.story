A 92-year-old war veteran has finally met the child whose life he saved when he selflessly threw himself in the path of a runaway racehorse to protect a five-year-old girl.

John Shear was seriously injured at Santa Anita Park in California three years ago, but he says he didn't give a second thought to his safety when he saw little Roxy Key was about to get crushed.

'I'm 90-years-old. I have had a life. She hasn't had a life,' he said. 'You got to save that life.'

Stalwart: 92-year-old John, who was injured in the Second World War, has worked at Santa Anita Park racetrack for more than 50 years

Roxy's father, Michael Key, told ABC News that if Mr Shear, who fought in the Second World War, hadn't been there to shield his daughter, she would have died.

'She would have been dead. It would have crushed her, and I would have had, I would have been holding my dead baby in my arms,' he said.

Mr Key and Roxy had been standing by the paddock watching the horses before they raced when one spooked and broke free from its handler in March 2011.

Mr Shear, who has worked at the track for 51 years, was holding a rope across a gap in the paddock when he saw the thoroughbred horse come charging towards him.

As he shouted at the spectators to clear the way he turned to see Roxy standing directly in the path of danger. 

'I knew I was going to get hit. I thought there was a possibility I was going to die but you 
cannot stop and think should I or shouldn’t I. There is a five-year-old 
girl,' he said.

The incident happened so quickly that Roxy's father said he didn't even have time to react.

'Before I could even think to even move, here comes Mr Shear he said. The horse barreled straight into the elderly track attendant, knocking him and Roxy to the ground.

'She got up and I was shaking. I was in 
shock,' Mr Key said. 'And she’s like, "I’m fine, papa, I’m fine", 
and then she looked over and saw Mr Shear on the ground and there was 
blood hemorrhaging and she lost it.'

The force of being hit by a horse put Mr Shear in hospital for more than a month. He had multiple pelvic fractures, a fractured cheekbone and cuts on his face and arm.

'Could have been worse. Something could have happened to the little girl,' he told the Los Angeles Times a couple of weeks after the accident. 'There's no question I would do it again.'

It took seven months before Mr Shear was well enough to return his beloved job at the race track, and nearly three years before he would meet the girl he saved.

'I have always wanted to meet her and I was so sad that I never got the chance to meet her when I got better,' Mr Shear said.

The 92-year-old, whose dreams of becoming a jockey were shattered after he was injured in the Second World War, was finally able to meet Roxy in July.

His longed for reunion came when Mr Shear watched Roxy, now aged eight, perform at a ballet studio,

'I was on pins and needles waiting to see her.  And when I finally see her come out and dance, it felt so exhilarating I can hardly explain,' Mr Shear said.

'When her mother came over and hugged me and said you’re my daughter’s guardian angel, I felt wonderful,' he said.
