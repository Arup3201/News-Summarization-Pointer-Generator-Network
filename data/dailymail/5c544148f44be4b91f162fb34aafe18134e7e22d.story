Dr Pam says she is seeing more and more childless women being taken advantage of by their friends with children

Not a week goes by these days without a story about fertility.

We know that many women choose to have children later in life these days and of course that many others simply decide that motherhood is not for them.

But, have you ever noticed just how many mums will call upon their childless friends and relatives to look after their children - often thinking it's okay to ask them to do so at the drop of a hat? I have. 

I'm really quite staggered by some of the mothers I've met who downright take advantage of the childless women in their lives to babysit for them - repeatedly and at a moment's notice - and to play auntie to their children.

Take a 40-something entrepreneur I met recently at a conference. 

Impeccably dressed and obviously a successful businesswoman we got talking about juggling careers with children.

She described how she’d never had to worry about hiring a nanny seeing as her business is operated online from her home-based office. 

Plus she had an old friend who’d never had children and has always stepped in for babysitting duties.

Nothing remarkable in that you might think, but then she then spouted on about how this friend had never seemed to realise that she was a bit taken advantage of.

In fact this mother enthused about how there could be nothing better than a practically built-in babysitter you could absolutely trust.

She said her friend had never met ‘the one’ to have children and evidently craved a sense of being loved by children.

Apparently she’d drop any plans just to have some of that precious feeling that Stella’s children needed her.

I didn’t press her on any guilty feelings she might have over this situation because clearly she had none.

And increasingly I've been struck by the number of times I've come across this rather sad state of affairs perhaps because I’m coming across more childless women - and the mothers all too willing to take advantage. 

With women postponing having children until much later, fertility issues have been an unfortunate and heart-breaking side-effect for many. 

Dr Pam says that many mothers are aware of the fact that they are taking advantage of their friends when they ask them to baby sit 

Yes, of course many childless women – who wanted children - come to terms with this and lead completely fulfilled lives but there are those who are quite desperate to be part of their friends’ children's lives. 

Some want to feel the children they volunteer to look after will love them back. Thus fulfilling some sense of maternal-child love by proxy.

You might argue it doesn't matter because both women are getting something from these arrangements. However I do think it matters when a mother knows full well what she's doing when taking advantage of a childless friend.

And if said friend knew the mother cared less about their friendship and more about having a babysitter on-tap (that is free and trustworthy) the childless friend would probably feel deeply hurt. Take one client, I’ll call Cathy, who told me how a childless friend was a "soft touch" (her words). Since Cathy's divorce she's left her two children with this friend for entire weekends so she could spend them with her new boyfriend. Cathy didn't seem to have many scruples about taking advantage in this way.

Because I was coaching her on better communication in relationships I pressed Cathy on the dynamics of this relationship. Did her friend realise she was incredibly convenient for Cathy, did Cathy feel she received more from this babysitting arrangement than her friend, and so on.

Dr Pam's book gives advice on how to deal with unhappy relationships 

Our conversation struck a nerve and Cathy seemed to wake up to the fact her friend was important to her and she’d be a little more selective about asking for favours and more respectful of their relationship.

Other women have in passing recounted tales of their childless friends who will do anything to spend time with their children. It can at times seem utterly selfish and a one-way street. No one would want to feel they were being used in this way, especially a woman who has already experienced a great sense of loss over being childless.

In my own experience one of my closest friends chose to remain childless as her career involves lots of travel. Career always came first for her and she’s been a wonderful presence in my children's lives. 

But I would never have considered taking advantage of her good will. And, as I said, it was Anna’s choice not to have children so she's hardly what you'd call 'desperate to look after children'.

I know there are other mothers who would never take advantage in this way, but I’m not concerned with them here. Ultimately these relationships should be a level playing field, the ground rules should be fair. No childless woman should ever be taken advantage of in this way.

My advice to childless women is don’t feel you have to drag yourself from pillar to post to be an on-tap, unpaid babysitter. Yes, absolutely enjoy the time you have with your friends’ children but make sure it’s an equitable, fair relationship.

To the mothers who might put a guilty conscience on hold just to get that free babysitting I say how would you feel being taken advantage of in this way? Can you treat your friend with more respect? What can you do for them in return? 

And consider how you’d feel if you lost their friendship if they caught on to the fact you have little respect for their needs. Happy, balanced relationships benefit all concerned.
