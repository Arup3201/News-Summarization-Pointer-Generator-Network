Jose Mourinho has heaped praise on Cesar Azpilicueta, claiming that the full-back possesses all the attributes required in a winning team.

Speaking ahead of Chelsea's Champions League tie against Galatasaray on Wednesday Mourinho said that winning the Champions League was the pinnacle for every player and manager in Europe.

But the 51-year-old also added that the Blues' opponents would be tricky customers to deal with, especially in the cauldron of the Turk Telekom Arena.

'Champions League is the competition I think everybody wants to win in football,' said Mourinho, speaking to sponsors adidas. 'The competition where normally every big club is, so obviously it's the competition that every club wants and every player, every coach dreams to win.

'Azpilicueta is the kind of player I like a lot. I think a team with 11 Azpilicueta's probably could win the competition because football is not just about the pure talent.

'Football is also about character and personality and Azpilicueta has all those traces of a winning personality.

'Last
 season I played against Galatasaray so I know the team, the atmosphere,
 how difficult it is to play against them, especially in Turkey but not 
just in Turkey.

'They
 are a very experienced team, top players, big atmosphere at home, 
people that know how to compete and people that know how to create 
difficulties.

'For sure by playing the first game at Istanbul they're 
going to give us a difficult tie.'

Out in the cold: Ashley Cole has spent a large part of the season having to warm himself on the bench

Earlier this season Azpilicueta went to great lengths to teach people - including his teammates to pronounce his surname.

He produced a handy video which can be seen below.

Mourinho's comments must come as a further knock for Ashley Cole with the left-back having lost his place in the starting line-up to the 24-year-old Spanish defender.

Cole has started just 19 matches this season but despite Mourinho's apparent lack of faith in him, the aging leftback looks set to be offered a one-year contract extension.

The manager also reiterated his belief that his side are one in transition and they remain too inconsistent to challenge for honours this year.

Despite Mourinho's claim Chelsea have lost just once in their last 12 league matches, since losing 3-2 to Stoke on December 7, having brushed aside rivals Manchester City, Liverpool, Manchester United and Everton in that time.

However, an extra time loss to Sunderland in the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup and a fourth round exit in the FA Cup at the hands of league opponents City have seen an unusually early exit for the Blues on the domestic cup front.

'We are not yet a stable team, we are 
not yet a team ready to perform consistently game after game, week after
 week,' admitted Mourinho.

'We
 are a team with little up and downs. Four victories, two defeats, I 
think it shows a little bit the quality of the team but at the same time 
we will beat that inconsistency.'

The Special One also took the time to 
speak about Brazilian play maker Oscar who has been paramount to much 
of Chelsea's success this season.

Having
 sidelined Juan Mata to give the 22-year-old a more prominent role, 
Mourinho acknowledged that Oscar is still continuing to grow as a 
player.

'Oscar has a fantastic talent; he plays a 
second year in Chelsea, he plays more or less a second year also in the 
Brazilian National team so he's coming step by step.

'Physically he needs time to put himself in a top condition, tactically he's a very open boy that wants very much to learn.

'Obviously technically he's a typically Brazilian talent so Oscar has also everything to make some history in the competition.'
