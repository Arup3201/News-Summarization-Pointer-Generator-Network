Luis Enrique has backed out-of-sorts striker Luis Suarez to find his form in front of goal after a slow start to his Barcelona career, insisting he has 'total confidence' in the former Liverpool hitman.

The Uruguay international, who moved from Merseyside to the Nou Camp for £70million in the summer, drew anther blank on Wednesday night as Barcelona recorded a narrow victory against Atletico Madrid in the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarter-final.

Suarez, who has only scored five goals since the big-money move, missed a gilt-edged chance to give Barcelona the lead in the first half against Atletico but somehow managed to fire over from five yards out.

But coach Enrique, who has been under pressure himself in recent weeks, is refusing to lose faith in the striker and is adamant Suarez will get among the goals soon.

'I have complete confidence in my team and complete confidence in Suarez,' Enrique said after the Atletico match.

'He didn't have a lot of luck in front of goal today. He couldn't find the net, but he played well and managed to push Atletico's defenders back.'

Lionel Messi scored the only goal of the game after turning in the rebound after his penalty was saved to give the home side a slender advantage going into the second leg.
