Young women are under so much pressure to look attractive that they first start considering plastic surgery aged just 17, according to a worrying new report.

One in five girls has thought about going under the knife by the age of 20, compared to just one in nine older women aged 50 or over.

And girls are getting younger when it comes to actually undergoing a cosmetic surgical procedure, with the average age for a first op now just 21.

The number of young people who are both considering and undergoing cosmetic procedures is rising

While around eight per cent of women admitted they have had some kind of surgical enhancement, a further 21 per cent are actively ‘considering it’ – and only 17 per cent claimed they would ‘never’ have any form of plastic surgery.

Botox remains the most popular form of cosmetic treatment in the UK, with a quarter of women who have had some form of procedure having the wrinkly-busting jabs.

A further 23 per cent have had a breast enlargement while four per cent have had a breast reduction. One in 14 has opted for a breast reshaping while staying the same cup size.

Tummy tucks are the most popular major body surgery, with 16 per cent of women who had surgery undergoing them.

But surgery to obtain a celebrity-style thigh gap is on the rise, with nine per cent of women who have ops undergoing liposuction on their legs.

The study, conducted by women’s website SoFemine.co.uk also shows fewer operations like eyelash transplants and intimate surgery are also growing in popularity with one in 24 girls having surgery opting for these.

However the very first treatment women opt to have done is split equally between Botox, breast enhancement and facial peels.

A huge two thirds of women (66 per cent) said going under the knife made them feel more confident and over half (51 per cent) claimed they did it ‘simply to look better for myself’.

But a third (32 per cent) admitted it was to be more attractive to men and 13 per cent had surgery to ‘try to keep a partner’. 

 And in a new trend, 11 per cent insisted surgery enhanced their career prospects by making them look younger and less stressed at work.

But worryingly, 16 per cent said they were worried having surgery could become ‘addictive’, as after the high of looking better after an op, they craved changes to other parts of their face or body.

However, the poll of 1,042 women revealed just 20 per cent thought surgery was ‘fully accepted’ in the UK.

Two in five claimed women still tried to cover up the fact they had had it while 23 per cent believed admitting to having cosmetic surgery risked making you ‘look like a bimbo’.

The study also revealed clear surgery trends.

While nose jobs and facelifts were seen as the most fashionable ways to look good in the 1980s, these had been replaced by breast enhancements in the 90s.

The noughties saw the rise of Botox, while the current most desired operations include thigh gap surgery and bottom enlargement and reshaping, such as the Brazilian Butt Lift, along with gastric bands.

But there was also anger at the status of cosmetic surgery in the UK. Almost half (47 per cent) were furious at the lack of consumer protection following the PIP implant scandal, while a third (31 per cent) believed treatments were ‘too easy to get’ and undertaken without proper checks and counseling.

One in five claimed surgery firms used ‘hard sell’ tactics to get women to sign up for ops, while 17 per cent worried the company bosses and surgeons were mainly men who ‘did not understand what women want’.

However a further 47 per cent complained treatments were too expensive, putting them out of the reach of a lot of people.

Worryingly, the high cost of surgery had seen 1.5 per cent of women perform DIY surgery on themselves or a friend, including Botox, fillers and ‘silicone bum boosting’ injections.

Commenting on the report, Sofeminine.co.uk Editorial Manager Ursula Dewey said: 'Once seen as the preserve of the old and rich, surgery is now a normal part of everyday life for tens of thousands of young women.

'Some may argue girls are doing it as they feel empowered to take control of their bodies while others complain they are under pressure from society to look good  - but women are thinking about it during their teenage years before they show any signs of aging.

'However what we are seeing is a real schism in the way women think about surgery. While two thirds claim surgery makes them feel confident inside and out, four in five women would be wary of admitting to having it. So while it’s acceptable to go under the knife, it’s still seen as something to keep secret.'
