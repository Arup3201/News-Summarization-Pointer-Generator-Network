For Ally McCoist, cups have a tendency to turn into poisoned chalices. But in a lengthy roll of dishonour in knockout competitions during his time at the helm at Rangers, this defeat against Alloa last night was just about as bad as it has ever been for the beleaguered Ibrox boss.

As Alloa celebrated their first-ever win over Rangers in their history, the theme tune from the A-Team blared out across the Indrodrill Stadium. To widespread astonishment, the plucky part-timers had come back from the dead: 2-0 down to win 3-2 and reach the final of the Challenge Cup.

But having presided over the most unlikely transformation since BA Baracus and co entered a shed armed with a couple of pipe cleaners and some bolts only to emerge with a fully kitted out armoured car, the sad truth for Rangers here was that they had actually just lost to Alloa's B-Team.

Man of the Match: Greig Spence

In the grip of a full-blown injury crisis, Alloa boss Barry Smith had been without eight key players: David Weatherston, Iain Flannigan, Stephen Simmons, Graeme Holmes, John Gibson, Jonathan Tiffoney, Kevin Cawley and Jason Marr. He could only fill five of the seven places on his bench. Indeed he wondered aloud at one point if he could field a team.

'Any more injuries and I think I might get a game,' sighed Wasps chairman Mike Mulraney before kick-off.

But still they beat a Rangers side who plumbed fresh depths at the Indodrill Stadium despite taking what looked an unassailable lead thanks to goals from Kenny Miller and Dean Shiels.

But two goals in 120 seconds from Greig Spence and then Ryan McCord had Alloa level, quite astonishingly. A fine winner from Spence merely left the Ibrox players, management staff and fans floored.

Spence had set up the winner for John Baird for Raith Rovers in the Ramsdens Cup  against Rangers earlier this year. McCoist had rated that as his lowest moment on the park during his side's climb up the leagues but last night's loss will surely rival it.

And on a dark night for Rangers, McCoist also suffered the added ignominy of losing his best player this season, Lewis Macleod, to what looked a nasty hamstring injury. He now faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines.

While Alloa struggled to field a fit team, McCoist, by stark contrast, had big-earners like John Daly, David Templeton, and Dean Shiels among his substitutes.

Daly's position on the bench was due to McCoist promoting Kris Boyd back into his starting line-up after dropping him for the last two matches. Boyd, of course, netted against former club Kilmarnock within 90 seconds of coming on as a substitute in the 3-0 Scottish Cup win on Sunday.

But Alloa could have been 3-0 up at half time. Spence missed a terrific chance when he miskicked in front of goal after a clever freekick was knocked down by Ben Gordon. Then Adam Asghar, on his full debut, hit a 25-yarder that skidded past Steve Simonsen's left post after Miller was robbed in possession.

The best Rangers could muster in the early stages was a Nicky Law shot from distance that posed no trouble to Craig McDowall and an Ian Black shot that struck Boyd on the back.

Then Simonsen had to run to the edge of his box to rescue Bilel Mohsni after the big defender misjudged a lofted through ball towards Ryan McCord.

Then the normally deadly Liam Buchanan squandered a great chance from ten yards, shanking wide with just Simonsen to beat. In just 45 minutes, Alloa had created three more chances than Kilmarnock mustered on Sunday at Ibrox.

This was not at all going to plan for McCoist and his players but they emerged from what was surely a rollicking and were a different outfit after the break. At the start, at least.

The Ibrox side was ahead on 49 minutes when Boyd's freekick was saved by McDowall and Miller was there to fire the loose ball home from ten yards.

Darren McGregor then forced a fine save from McDowall, but a second goal arrived when Ian Black found Miller, who set up Dean Shields to curl a low shot beyond McDowall from the edge of the area. Game over, Rangers were on easy street. Or so they thought. But two goals in two sensational minutes utterly changed all that.

First, Docherty chipped the ball back in and Spence headed into the net. Then substitute Eddie Ferns set up the outstanding Ryan McCord for an unlikely leveller to leave Rangers stunned.

Alloa keeper McDowall saved spectacularly from substitute Daly before Steven Hetherington set up Spence for a fabulous winner. The part-timers now faces Livingston in the final next April, dreaming of winning the cup for the first time since 1999.

Smith danced in the home dugout like Hannibal Smith, the Alloa boss loves it when a plan comes together. He can claim this was no fluke. Three times this season his side has faced Rangers and they are yet to lose – drawing 1-1 home and away in the Championship.

For Ally McCoist, however, after this latest sting in the tail from the Wasps, the coming days will surely see the Ibrox legend face fresh calls for his head in a season that also sees them trail Hearts in the league by nine points.
