Bigger is better for car passenger safety claims a new study that has identified the Fiat 500 as the most dangerous car to have a crash in.

The American research shows that the sub-compact car has the highest insurance rates for policies that pay for injuries to passengers in an accident.

It claims that even though small cars like the Fiat can score well in crash tests, the sheer size of bigger vehicles will ultimately better protect passengers from injuries.

An IIHS Top Safety Pick: But an expert from the organisation nevertheless warned drivers to avoid the smallest cars if passenger safety is their priority, since bigger vehicles offer more protection

'If safety is a priority, you should avoid the smallest cars,' said Russ Rader, spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).

'The laws of physics are always in play in crashes. Weight counts.

'Smaller, lighter cars are safer than they used to be, but all things being equal, people riding in bigger, heavier vehicles get more protection in crashes.'

In a head-on crash, the vehicle that is heavier will drive the lighter one backward, increasing crash forces for the people in the lighter car and reducing forces for those in the heavier one, said Mr Rader.

He added: 'Smaller cars also have less crush space in front to manage the energy of a crash and help "cushion" the occupants as the vehicle comes to a stop.'

The research by Insure.com, a U.S. insurance price comparison website, analysed rates for Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and Medical Payments (MedPay) policies, which cover payouts to injured passengers.

Using insurance rates for more than 750 vehicles in our annual car insurance comparison study, the study picked out the vehicles with the lowest and highest costs for PIP and MedPay coverage.

The Fiat 500 has good crash test ratings and it is an IIHS Top Safety Pick, but these insurance costs, based on the amounts of claims made, should reflect the real-world safety of the vehicle.

The way they are driven also effects the figures, however.

Top of the list of safest vehicles was the U.S.-made GMC Sierra 1500 pick-up truck. Vehicles from the General Motors truck marque filled four spots in the list of the top five safest.

'Italian design proves to be no match for American brawn when it comes to passenger safety,' the research noted.
