The Florida homes on either side of the Tampa area house where a sinkhole opened under a man's bedroom are being demolished.

Officials say the demolition will take place today in Seffner, Florida. The homes were condemned on April 1, a month after the sinkhole opened under the house next door, killing 37-year-old Jeffrey Bush.

Engineering consultants determined that repairing the homes would cost more than 50 per cent of their value,Â The Tampa Bay Times reported.

To be demolished: Demolition began this morning on two more homes (one pictured) in the Seffner neighborhood where a sinkhole swallowed a man alive in February

Frightening: A bird's eye view shot shows the sinkhole which swallowed Jeff Bush from his bed in February

On Wednesday morning, heavy equipment and trucks will return to the neighborhood to demolish the homes.

In February
Jeff Bush, 37, was sucked into the sinkhole while he slept in his 
family home in Seffner and when his brother, Jeremy, jumped in the hole 
to try to save him, he was nowhere to be seen.

Footage
taken by a contractor who examined the hole shortly before the home was
demolished showed that every piece of furniture had vanished.

Most
bizarre is how the ground had completely given way - revealing the 
brown dirt beneath - yet hats, high-visibility jackets and shelves 
remain on the wall above where Bush's bed once was.

A day after the accident, authorities stopped their search for Bush as tests showed no sign of life in the hole. The house was torn down and the family hopes to set up a memorial at the site.

Neighbours left their properties and the county has said that the houses on each side of the sinkhole house were condemned.

'The results of the geophysical tests concluded that the subsurface soils were unstable as subsidence activity is evidenced at each site,' County Administrator Michael Merrill said.

Bizarre: Hats are still hanging on a doorknob in the bedroom in Seffner, Florida yet the ground beneath the wall has completely vanished. The freak accident claimed the life of 37-year-old Jeff Bush, right

Gone: This video still shows the hanging hats, left, above the massive hole in the ground. The video was taken by a contractor shortly before the home was demolished

Bush, 37, was in his bedroom in Seffner - a suburb of 8,000 people 15 miles east of downtown 
Tampa - when the earth opened up on the night of February 28.

Five others in the house escaped unharmed.

Jeremy 
Bush, 36, recalled how he desperately tried to pull his brother, Jeff, from the rubble
as he heard his screams for help.

'I ran in there and heard somebody screaming, my brother screaming, and I ran in there,' he told My Fox Tampa Bay .

'And
all I see is this big hole. All I see is the top of his bed. I didn't 
see anything else, so I jumped in the hole and tried getting him out.

Hidden: The hole was largely hidden beneath the home but was seen as the property was demolished

Crushed: Demolition experts watched as the Bush's home was destroyed three days after his death

'The
floor was still giving in and the dirt was still going down, but I 
didn't care. I wanted to save my brother. I could hear him screaming for
me, hollering for
me. I couldn't do nothing.'

Jeremy had tried to save his brother 
when he heard him screaming, but was unable to reach him. A deputy 
pulled Jeremy out of the sinkhole, and likely saved his life.

Following the tragedy, Jeremy Bush said he believed the rescue teams should not have given up so soon.

'I feel like they could 
have tried harder to get my brother out of there,' he said. 'That was my
brother. No one is even talking about what my mom and dad are going 
through. They don't want to be on camera. My mom and dad are going 
through hell right now.'

Break down: Jeremy Bush, right, told reporters that not enough was done to get his brother Jeff out of a sinkhole during an emotional interview as the family house was demolished

Remembered: Jeremy Bush set up a makeshift memorial for his brother before demolition began

The 20-foot-wide opening of the sinkhole was almost covered by the 
house, and rescuers said there were no signs of life after the hole 
opened.

Experts say thousands of sinkholes 
erupt yearly in Florida because of the state's unique geography, though 
most are small and deaths rarely occur.

'There's hardly a place in Florida 
that's immune to sinkholes,' said Sandy Nettles, who owns a geology 
consulting company. 'There's no way of ever predicting where a sinkhole 
is going to occur.'

Watch out: Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by sinkholes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey

A sinkhole is a hole that opens up suddenly in the ground. They mostly occur because of erosion or underground water that gathers naturally or due to man-made activities.

When this water dissolves the foundation beneath the surface layer, spaces and caverns develop underground. Limestone, carbonate rock, 
and salt beds are particular vulnerable to this erosion.

Meanwhile, the top layer of Earth usually stays intact. When the dissolving area beneath the surface becomes too large, the surface suddenly gives way.

According
to the U.S. Geological Survey, Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, 
Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by 
sinkholes.

While they often
occur from natural causes, sinkholes can be man-made and caused by 
human activity. Groundwater pumping and construction are the most likely
culprits. They can also occur when water drainage systems are changed.
