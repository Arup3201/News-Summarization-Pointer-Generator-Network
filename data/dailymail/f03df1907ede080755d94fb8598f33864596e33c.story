Irish judges will decide on Friday  whether they will order a maternity hospital to turn off the life support machine of a clinically dead woman who is almost 18 weeks pregnant.

The woman's parents and her partner, who is the father of the unborn child, all want the woman to be allowed to die. 

However, the eight amendment of the Irish Constitution guarantees the equal status of the right to life of unborn with that of the woman. As a result, the hospital has ignored the next-of-kin's requests and has sought a ruling from the High Court.

The case which is being heard in the High Court in Dublin, pictured, involves a 17-week pregnant clincally dead woman, whose  parents and partner want to end life support, but this is being opposed by the hospital

High Court president Nicholas Kearns, pictured, said he will deliver his verdict on the case on Friday 

Five groups of lawyers appeared in the High Court in Dublin today, representing the woman, her baby, her parents, her partner and finally the hospital.

The High Court heard today from lawyers representing the hospital that there was no chance that the foetus was viable and would be born alive.

The court will hear from all five parties tomorrow morning and deliver their decision on Friday.  

High Court president Justice Nicholas Kearns said: 'Time is of the essence.'  

Three judges of the High Court will issue a ruling on Friday, however it is possible that this decision could be appealed to the nation's Supreme Court.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is in her 20s and is being kept in a hospital outside Dublin, which also cannot named. 

The woman's father was told in November 29 that his daughter had died although the hospital was obliged to keep her on life support as there was a foetal heartbeat.  

In the past, Irish hospitals have kept pregnant women on life support even after brain death in order to attempt to save the life of the unborn child.  

In the most recent documented cases, in 2001 and 2003, the foetus died in the womb after one or two weeks. 

In this case, the woman's parents and her partner have filed lawsuits asking the High Court to order the hospital to switch off the life support machine. 

If ordered, the hospital may keep the woman on life support for a further 17 weeks.

The mother, who is in her 20s has been declared clinically dead following a brain trauma. 

The court case has reopened Ireland's fractious debate on abortion and the rights of the unborn  

Judge Kearns said: ‘If we could have that evidence, it would enable the court to have sufficient information to be able to make a quick and timely decision.’ He said: ‘Time is of the essence. 

‘The longer time passes, it might seem incorrectly to some to foreclose some options. That’s the last thing the court wants. The court is treating this as a matter of some urgency. But at the same time, I am hoping the levels of representation will bring home to people that all four corners are to be consulted and their views are being taken into consideration.’

He added: ‘This is a very sensitive case, and a source of great distress to the family. The court will take it very seriously.’

John Rogers Senior Counsel, for the woman’s father, said an application for her to be taken into wardship, which was raised last Monday, will be dealt with at a later date.

He said that the main focus at trial today will be a full hearing of the father’s wish for certain court orders and declarations concerning the future care of the pregnant woman. The court has not yet been told what those orders and declarations will be.

Mr Rogers said he would be relying on affidavits, including one from the woman’s father, and that he could be calling up to two members of her family to give witness evidence. He said he will be calling one or perhaps two medical witnesses.

Conor Dignam SC said he would be representing the interests of the unborn. Barrister Donal Ó Muircheartaigh said he was representing the interests of the mother.

Gerard Durcan SC, for the Health Service Executive, said it was an urgent and delicate matter. He said the HSE had been ‘scrambling’ to assemble all the required witnesses and evidence for today’s hearing, and to arrange two independent firms of solicitors to instruct counsel for the unborn child and its mother.

Mr Durcan said the HSE hoped to be in a position to have medical reports from a consultant obstetrician, a consultant in intensive care medicine and a consultant neurologist.

He said there would also be a report ‘from the treating doctors on the ground’ in the hospital where the woman, who cannot be identified, is currently.

And he said her full medical notes would be made available.

The court also heard that the consultant neurosurgeon who treated the woman at a Dublin hospital prior to her return to the hospital outside the capital, had provided his report and could give further evidence if necessary.

Judge Kearns said he would hear the case, along with Ms Justice Marie Baker and Ms Justice Caroline Costello.
