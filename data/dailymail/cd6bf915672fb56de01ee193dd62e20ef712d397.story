An Afghan veteran and another soldier have been convicted of running an illegal payday loans business.

Lance Corporal Charles Trouliotis made thousands by charging squaddies interest rates of up to 40 per cent.

He used money from an Army compensation payout to lend £31,000 to around 30 soldiers, using his senior rank to threaten them with punishment duty if they did not pay him back on time.

Trouliotis and Corporal David Crouch, both of the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment, denied two counts of running an unlicensed credit firm and one of money laundering but were convicted by a jury at Woolwich Crown Court.

Trouliotis, 25, of Victoria, London, who is no longer a soldier, was given a 12-month community order with 160 hours of unpaid work. 

Couch, 28, of Woolwich Barracks, was fined £300 and told to pay a £30 victim surcharge.

Stuart Jessop, prosecuting, said father-of-one Trouliotis used his senior rank to bully and threaten his subordinates to pay back 'exorbitant' amounts of interest.

Mr Jessop said: 'There's no doubt that you were a first class soldier and a brave soldier. You were highly decorated.

'But you were running an illegal money lending business for profit.

'You used the fact that you were respected and well liked to help you with this money lending business.' 

One private gave evidence to say that an initial loan of £400 spiralled into a £1,800 debt and he was threatened with punishment duty if he failed to pay.

Mr Jessop added: 'He was struggling to pay you back because you were charging exorbitant interest.

'You would say 'where's my f***ing money you will go on standby if you don't pay this money'.'

Standby is army slang for a punishment where superiors order someone to do unwanted jobs.

A text from Trouliotis's phone to Couch accused him of having 's**t' money lending skills.

It read: 'You realise the palava you have caused us with your shit money lending skills. You are a f**king c**t Dave and I should never have trusted you.'

Trouliotis, who is no longer a soldier, told the jury of seven men and five women that he hadn't sent the text.

He accepted that he had lent the money and accepted 'good will' overpayments from 23 subordinate privates as well as four lance corporals and two corporals.

But he denied that he set interest rates and threatened them if they failed to pay by payday.

Both men, who appeared before the judge in navy and yellow regimental ties, denied two counts of running an unlicensed credit firm and one count of money laundering between January 2012 and May 2013.
