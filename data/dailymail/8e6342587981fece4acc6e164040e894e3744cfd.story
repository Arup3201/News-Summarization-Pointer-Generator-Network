Thanks to the advent of new technology love letters aren't what they used to be. While handwritten letters sent in the post could once literally be 'sealed with a loving kiss', today an 'x' or two at the end of an email or text can be as romantic as it gets.

But now Burberry, in association with Google, are aiming to bring some love back into our correspondence.

They have invented 'Burberry Kisses' as a way of 'humanising technology through emotive digital experiences'.

Love in the digital age: Touchscreen technology is used to create your own kiss

What this means is users can log onto to Kisses.Burberry.com where they can send a personal kiss to a loved one. They can do this by either capturing a picture of their lips on a desktop camera or by kissing their touch screen mobile.

If you're not able to provide a kiss of your own lips via a camera or touch screen, Burberry also have their own 'quick kisses' that can be sent.

Before sending their kiss, users can then chose what lip colour they want from Burberry's range of shades including pinks, purples, nudes and reds.

They can then add a personal message before sending their kiss off digitally to their nearest and dearest.

But the fun doesn't end there. The journey of each kiss is then brought to life through a personalisedanimation showing three-dimensional city skylines such as London and New York, charting the delivery progress from the sender's location to the recipient's.

The personal element is added with the use of Google Earth and Street View technologies to show the letter winging its way to its destination.

For those who still don't understand how to send a kiss, Burberry have created a how to video, which you can view below, explaining how it works. 

The video features musician Misty Miller singing 'Evergreen Love' and stars up and coming British models Charlotte Wiggins and Rob Pryor.

Charlotte features in the Burberry Spring/Summer 2013 campaign and the 
Burberry Prorsum Spring/Summer 2014 pre-collection lookbook, and has 
walked several Burberry runway shows
while Rob features in the campaign for Burberry’s watch collection The Britain, launched in October 2012.

The Burberry website has a real time 'World of Kisses' map so people can see where kisses are being sent around the globe and discover which city is the most romantic.

Burberry chief creative officer Christopher Bailey explains why they came up with the idea.

'We're constantly thinking about how we translate the emotion of what we create and experience in the real world into the digital space, whether that's capturing the energy and excitement of a live gig, the hum and buzz of anticipation before a runway show, or just the feeling you get when you pull on your trench coat on a rainy morning.' he said.

'Burberry Kisses began with the idea of giving technology a bit of heart and soul, and using it to unite the Burberry family across the world - by telling a story that makes the digital personal.'
