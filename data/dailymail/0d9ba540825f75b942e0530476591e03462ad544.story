Eton is to sponsor a free school to spread its ethos to state education, it revealed yesterday.

The college will be the sole private backer of a secondary school aiming to give 500 pupils many of the hallmarks of a public school education for free, including a traditional house system and homework classes on the premises.

Boarding will be available for nearly half the pupils, while day students at the non-selective government-funded school will be able to leave in the evening ‘after homework and a sociable supper with school friends’.

Opening: Eton College has announced it is to back Holyport College (plans pictured above) - a new state boarding school set to open next year

Plans: How the College Square will look at the new school, which will evetually have 500 students

Restored: The existing palm house, which is to be refurbished as part of the plans for the school

Preparation: The new state-funded school, in Maidenhead, is due to open in September 2014

A fifth of places for day pupils will be set aside for children from poor homes and 21 boarding places will go to youngsters on the verge of being taken into care.

The school’s prospectus says: ‘By providing stability, routine and exceptional pastoral care we believe we can turn their lives around and give them an equal chance to succeed in life.’

A further 28 boarders will be funded or part-funded through bursaries and some boarding places will be reserved for military families.

The move is a coup for David Cameron and his Education Secretary Michael Gove, who have been wooing leading independent schools in the hope they will ‘share their DNA’ with the state sector through free schools and academies.

The new ‘mini-Eton’, to be called Holyport College, will be a mixed school catering for 500 pupils aged from 11 to 18 in the village of Holyport, near Windsor, seven miles from Eton.

Eton’s involvement in the new school will be far-reaching, beginning with the appointment of a head teacher.

The £32,067-a-year public school – whose old boys include Mr Cameron and 18 other British prime ministers – will also design the curriculum, advise on the boarding facilities, second teachers to Holyport, help pupils with applications to top universities and allow them to share its extensive sports facilities.

Mr Gove said: ‘This is an outstanding example of a state-independent education partnership.

‘Eton College’s heritage of distinguished academic and co-curricular excellence will be of benefit to all Holyport’s pupils, and will allow them to enjoy exceptional facilities while attending a free school.

Tony Little, Eton’s headmaster, said:
 ‘We believe in the vision for Holyport College as a new state boarding 
school and see its geographical proximity to Eton as a real opportunity.

‘We have a leading role on the governing body and will help shape the school ready for opening in September 2014.

‘We look forward to sharing a number 
of our facilities and activities, and developing educational initiatives
 for the benefit of pupils of both colleges.’

The new school’s founders include 
Simon Dudley, a banker and deputy leader of Tory-controlled Windsor and 
Maidenhead Council, and William Moore, a maths teacher at Eton.

Eton already jointly sponsors the 
London Academy of Excellence – a sixth-form college to help teenagers in
 Newham, East London, get into elite universities.
