Britain is handing out citizenship to more migrants than any other European Union country after an influx of foreigners lasting more than a decade.

Almost a quarter of all new citizenships – which invariably pave the way to a British passport – were provided by the UK.

Official figures published by Eurostat, the official statistics organisation of the European Commission, showed this country gave citizenship to 193,900 people in 2012.

Official figures published yesterday showed the UK gave citizenship – which invariably paves the way to a British passport – to 193,900 people

At 23.7 per cent, that was the highest proportion of almost 820,000 foreigners given citizenship by any of the 28 EU nations.

Migrants from India headed the list of those granted a UK passport, with 14.6 per cent. This was followed by Pakistan (9.5 per cent), Nigeria (4.6 per cent) and the Philippines (4.2 per cent). 

But around 10,500 people from other EU countries also claimed citizenship – around 1 in 20 – suggesting many who arrived from Eastern Europe after restrictions were lifted in 2004 want to set up home

Germany granted the second highest number of new citizenships with 114,000, followed by France on 96,000.

In total, more than 2.1million people from overseas have been given British citizenship since the turn of the century as those who arrived during the biggest wave of migration in history decided to settle.

The figures will fuel concerns at the scale of immigration as the Tories and Labour attempt to tackle the ballooning popularity of Ukip. 

Nigel Farage’s anti-Europe party is expected to sweep to victory in today’s Rochester and Strood by-election, claiming its second Westminster seat, on the back of voters’ worries about the pressure migration is placing on public services and jobs.

It was 23.7 per cent – the highest proportion of almost 820,000 foreigners given citizenship by any of the 28 EU nations in 2012

Yesterday, a separate report by the British Future think-tank said a ‘shocking’ 25 per cent of people surveyed wanted to send home all immigrants, whether legal or illegal. 

It also warned that liberal attacks accusing Ukip of racism may have strengthened support for the party by boosting its ‘outsider’ appeal.

Commenting on Eurostat’s figures, Sir Andrew Green of the MigrationWatch UK think tank said: ‘Clearly, Britain remains the No1 EU destination for migrants from outside the EU. 

It is imperative we bear down on non-EU immigration while looking at ways of restricting the flow from the EU.’

Dr Carlos Vargas-Silva, deputy director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, said: ‘The UK is the leader in terms of people acquiring citizenship in the EU and one of the reasons this is happening is because of migration from the Commonwealth.’

Those applying for citizenship must have lived in the UK for at least five years.

Separate Home Office figures have shown the number of migrants given citizenship jumped to 208,000 last year, with applications increasing as they dashed to get passports before new rules on English language skills were introduced.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that 14.6, 9.5, 4.6 and 4.2 were the numbers in millions of migrants from India, Pakistan, Nigeria and the Philippines respectively granted UK citizenship in 2012. We are happy to clarify that these were in fact the respective percentages of UK citizenships granted to people from those countries.
