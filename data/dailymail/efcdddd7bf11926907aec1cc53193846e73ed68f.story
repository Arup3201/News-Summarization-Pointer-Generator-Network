Film makers have been banned from shooting action scenes in Paris in the wake of the terrorist shootings which left 20 people dead.

It means that the kind of classic segments which have thrilled generations of movie lovers cannot be repeated.

Announcing the measure, police commander Sylvie Barnaud said: ‘There’s a problem with these action scenes, as the actors in uniform could be targets for terrorism.

‘Also the actors could cause confusion for the general public during this highly-sensitive period.’

The police chief said anyone displaying fake weapons in the French capital would have them confiscated, while pyrotechnics were also banned.

Commander Barnaud said the indefinite restrictions were hugely important in a city where thousands of armed police wearing bullet proof vests are still on the street.

This follows the January attack on the officers of the anti-Islamic satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people died.

A policewoman was shot dead the next morning, and then there were four more fatalities in a Kosher store before three Al Qaeda and Islamic State-linked terrorists were themselves gunned down.

Commander Barnaud said: ‘I was shocked to hear witnesses of the Charlie Hebdo attacks say on television that “it seemed like a movie shoot to us”’.’

Paris is one of the most popular film locations in the world, with producers using its ancient squares and boulevards constantly.

Last year alone there were 930 shoots in the capital, 20 of which were by international teams, including ones from Hollywood.

Classic movies set in the French capital have also included The Day of the Jackal, in which Edward Fox plays an assassin contracted to shoot President Charles de Gaulle.

Made in 1973, its opening scene shows the head of state’s unarmed Citroen car being raked with machine gun fire by OAS terrorists protesting against the independence of Algeria, France’s former colony.

The two brothers responsible for the Charlie Hebdo attacks were both French-Algerians, and they were also filmed killing a policeman on a Paris street.

France remains on a high terror alert following the attacks, with many fearing that other home-grown terror cells could strike again.
