Liverpool and Juventus target Xherdan Shaqiri has denied he is planning to leave Bayern Munich.

The Swiss international was quoted in Italian media last week saying he would be open to a move to the Turin giants after failing to win a regular starting place.

Earlier this summer he was also linked with a move to Anfield as Brendan Rodgers looks to add to his squad.

However the winger has quashed any rumours by telling fans on Facebook he is happy at the Bundesliga champions.

Writing on Facebook he said: ‘It is the time of year when much is written, but as we all know, there is very little truth behind it.

‘As you all know I am currently on holiday so I am not in talks with other clubs nor have I spoken with any journalists.

‘I have a contract with FC Bayern until 2016.

‘My advisors are in regular contact with the responsible people at FC Bayern so there is no reason for speculation.’
