Downloading took off in a big way in 2004, the same year that a separate sales chart was launched, and figures went on to be included in the main singles chart the following year.

More than three million singles are now downloaded each week in the UK.

Chief executive of the British Phonographic Industry, Geoff Taylor, said: ‘The digital music revolution has made it easy to buy any song you like, instantly, for half the price of a coffee.

‘As fans increasingly download music on the move, tablets, smartphones and connected cars will drive another phase in digital music's expansion.’

Official Charts Company managing director, Martin Talbot, added: ‘The explosion in download sales over the past nine years means we are genuinely now living in the digital music age - with Adele as our queen.

‘Over the nine years of legitimate digital music, more than 16 new tracks have sold one million copies, which emphasises just how popular digital music is in the modern age.’
