An enraged renter shot dead three people, barricaded himself in a home and opened fire in a standoff with police before surrendering to authorities in Pasadena, California Saturday afternoon.

The suspect taken into custody has been identified as 44-year-old John Izeal Smith.

Maria Theresa Aguiar, 59, is the only victim who has been identified so far. Police are waiting to release the names of the other two victims until they have notified family. The two injured in the incident, an unidentified man and woman, are reportedly being treated for non life-threatening injuries at the hospital.Â

Deadly: A Pasadena neighborhood was shaken yesterday when a tenant-landlord dispute turned violent and three people were shot dead

Neighbors reported hearing shots fired around 4:20pm on the 1700 block of Summit Avenue.

Police believe Smith, a renter, got into a dispute with his landlord that afternoon and pulled out a semi-automatic weapon.

One of the victims, a man in his 70s, was found dead inside one of the homes, while Aguiar's body was found laying in the sidewalk to the side of that house.

The third victim was an unidentified 'Good Samaritan' in his 20s who ran towards the shots, hoping to help the injured.

Two other people, a man and woman in their 40s, were also injured and are being treated for minor to moderate injuries.

Police received over 10 calls related to the shots fired, and the first responding officer was shot at as he tried to help one of the victims lying in the street.

While Smith, barricaded in a home, continued to fire rounds at responding police vehicles, no police officer was injured in the incident.

Eventually Smith called 911 and, after speaking with a dispatcher and hostage negotiator, decided to surrender to police.

He was arrested and booked at Pasadena City Jail where he is currently being held on $1million bond.

'That is a deliberate act, apparently it's cowardly,' Pasadena Police Chief Phillip Sanchez said. 'He used a firearm to kill individuals who weren't armed and couldn't defend themselves. They had to run, literally, for their lives.'

After police swept the house Smith barricaded himself in, they recovered his rifle as well as additional firearms he did not use in the attack.

It's still unclear which house Smith was renting, but Aguiar is listed as owning a home on North Summit Street.
