The heartbroken sister of a teenager who died while celebrating his mother's 40th birthday after plunging from a sixth floor balcony has paid tribute to her 'baby brother'.

Police were called to the Crowne Plaza Hotel in, Terrigal, near Gosford, on the NSW Central Coast, after reports of an unconscious man near the pool at 9.30pm on Saturday.

Jarrod Samson-Hills, 19, suffered serious head and internal injuries after police said he hit a hardwood decked area near a swimming pool.

Police Inspector Steve Kentwell said alcohol and the possibility that the man was attempting to jump in the pool were being looked at as contributing factors and it was unclear exactly how the man fell from the balcony.
