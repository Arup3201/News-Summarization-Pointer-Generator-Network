A pair of adrenaline junkies took their love of extreme sports to a new level by being sling-shotted out of a paraglider at nearly 15,000 feet.

Thrill-seeking Horacio Llorens, 32, from Spain, and Hernán Pitocco, 36, from Argentina, performed the daring stunt high above the Pyrenees mountain range in southwest Europe.

They took a hot air balloon to 14,700 feet, and then the pair were filmed as they hurled themselves off the edge, before launching into a series of stunning somersaults.

After building up to a massive force of 7G, they sling-shotted themselves out of a paraglider and skydived down to a ski resort below.

Mr Llorens, who is a five-time Acro Paragliding World Cup Champion and a Guinness World Record holder, explained he and Mr Pitocco needed to be perfectly in sync.

He said: 'To do it safely, we both needed to release from the glider together, at a very precise moment, to ensure we wouldn't fall into the glider.

'We are not so good at this type of thing as we are at paragliding so it was necessary to feel comfortable in the air to do the slingshot properly.

So in order to prepare for the moment, the paragliders both spent seven hours training in a wind tunnel

He added: 'We took the hot air balloon to about 4,500 metres, and exited by letting the glider hang out of the basket, then tumbling over it.

The pair first took a hot air balloon to 14,700 feet, before securing themselves to a paraglider which they later sling-shotted out of

Five-time Acro Paragliding World Cup Champion and world record holder Mr Llorens said it's one of the 'coolest' things he's ever done

'At 3,900 metres we did about 13 revolutions and then after 13, we released, at around 3,400 metres.

'Then it was a simple sky-dive to the landing at 2,000 metres, at the ski resort of La Molina.'

Mr Llorens is a pioneer of aerobatic paragliding, which he began learning at the age of 14 as he watched his cousin's fly at his uncle’s paragliding school in the Spanish industrial aviation hub of Albacete.  

At 18, he entered his first competition, one of the very few synchronised aerobatic paragliding tournaments that existed in those days, as the discipline was regarded as too dangerous. 

Not long after placing second at the Red Bull Vertigo competition in 2002, he found his synchro partner, Argentine Hernán Pitocco.

Despite his impressive career, Mr Llorens said the slingshot stunt is 'one of the coolest things I've ever done in my life.' 

Mr Pitocco moved to La Cumbre, a remote part of the Córdoba province in Argentina, to pursue his love of the sport at 18. 

'The first thing I do in the morning when I wake up is look out of the window to test the wind and see if I will be able to fly,' he said.

'Depending on that, I then organise my day.'

Mr Lorens said: 'To do it safely, we both needed to release from the glider together, at a very precise moment, to ensure we wouldn't fall'

Mr Llorens said the pair exited the hot air balloon by letting the glider hang out of the basket, then tumbling over the side
