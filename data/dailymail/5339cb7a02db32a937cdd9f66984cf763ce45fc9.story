Those not naturally blessed in the cleavage department have previously only had the option of stuffing their bra or surgery to achieve an eye-catching embonpoint.

But now a similar effect can be created without all the discomfort and hassle - by simply slipping on a T-shirt.

Called the ‘peek-a-boo’, this printed T-shirt the Japanese designer Takayuki Fukuzawa aims to, in the words of the designer, ‘bring to life the world of delusion that people secretly envision.’

Not a subtle statement, the Peek-a-boo T-shirt will certainly attract attention

The T-shirts come with a variety of colour choices for the 'bra', with different cleavages on offer too

The website poses the question: ‘How will people react when the world the inside their heads is laid bare before their eyes?

‘The time when our imaginings can be kept private in our minds has long passed

‘So, everyone don a delusion mapping t-shirt and jump into a new world of ambitious dreams!’

Japanese designer Takayuki Fukuzawa wanted to 'bring to life the world of delusion that people secretly envision'

The T-shirts are certain to raise a smile - and perhaps a few odd looks - if worn out in public

While we’re not sure that everyone’s inner world involves perky breasts, or that the peek-a-boo t-shirt will launch a ‘new world of ambitious dreams', it will certainly get a giggle or lustful look if worn out in public.

You can even chose a variety of colours for the bra underneath, and there are different breast shapes available - though all are a generous size.
