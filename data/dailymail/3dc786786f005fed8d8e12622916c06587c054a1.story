Fabulous lingerie is surely a perk of the job for the Victoria's Secret girls, but after their catwalk appearance on Wednesday most of the stars lost their bras and instead headed out in a selection of chest-baring outfits.

Flashing serious flesh in dresses slashed to the navel models Candice Swanepoel, Alessandra Ambrosio and Josephine Skriver were among the stars rocking the revealing trend.

Instead of the plump, bouncing cleavage seen on the runway hours before, the key accessory for the red carpet appeared to be the 'no cleavage' - a testament to the magic properties of the Victoria's Secret bras that had been modelled.

Her big night! Candice was chosen to wear the Fantasy Bra on the runway and she dressed to impress as she celebrated afterwards 

A
few strips of carefully placed material (and a LOT of double-sided 
tape) prevented them from completely revealing themselves but several of
the women were at risk of spilling their secrets as they partied at TAO Downtown in New York City.

Alessandra, 32,went back to the Eighties in tight red leather. 25-year-old Candice, celebrating one of the 
biggest nights of her career after she was chosen to wear the $10 
million Fantasy Bra, chose a white long-sleeved mini dress which flashed a lot of leg.

And Josephine, 20, kept it simple in a little black dress featuring a pelmet skirt worn with heavy gold bracelets.

Unlike
the overtly sexy display on the catwalk, these dresses are seen as very
'fashion' in that they are all about showing off how skinny the wearer 
is. These women have worked hard for their show bodies and they were intent on showing them off as much as possible.

Daring: Alessandra Ambrosio's red leather bondage inspired outfit was also slashed down the front

Ironic: For a group of women who've made their name modelling lingerie, many of the Victoria's Secret models chose to forgo underwear at the after party

As
well as Candice and co. there were other models daring to bare at the 
wrap party. Karlie Kloss showed off some 'underboob' in a white 
criss-cross dress while Behati Prinsloo was completely flat-chested 
underneath her pink ruched midi-dress and British model Lily Donaldson chose a crop top under a mismatching dress.

The
women were celebrating another successful Victoria's Secret runway 
show. The annual event has become a fixture on the fashion calendar with
months of preparation for both the show hosts and the models lucky 
enough to be cast. The catwalk is invite only but is broadcast globally 
on December 10. 

Josephine Skriver wore a VERY little black dress featuring another slashed neckline and a pelmet skirt

Lily Donaldson's dress appeared half-finished and she was another model revealing inches through 'no cleavage' while Karlie Kloss showed off some underboob in a criss-cross dress

Behati Prinsloo was elegant in a pink dress while Martha Hunt DID remember her bra, but the heavy black clashed with her pretty lace outfit, Lily Donaldson appeared to have forgotten half of her outfit

South African Candice was seen as the star of the show, following in the footsteps of Miranda Kerr, Tyra Banks, Gisele Bündchen, Heidi 
Klum, Alessandra Ambrosio, Adriana Lima and Claudia Schiffer, she was 
picked to showcase the lingerie brand's multi-million dollar Fantasy 
Bra.

This year's design, titled 'The Royal', was designed by renowned jeweller, Mouawad.

The bra - nicknamed 'The Royal' - is 
adorned with over 4,200 precious gems from around the world including 
rubies, diamonds, and yellow sapphires.

Where did they come from? Candice Swanepoel shows off some impressive cleavage earlier in the evening

In
the real world of course these dresses are almost impossible to wear 
unless you are very slim or have a small chest and stand very still for 
most of the evening. But if you have toned tummy that you really want to flash then choose a tight halter neck that will help give you some support OR still wear a bra but make sure it's beautiful and bright and the it becomes a feature it part of the outfit.
