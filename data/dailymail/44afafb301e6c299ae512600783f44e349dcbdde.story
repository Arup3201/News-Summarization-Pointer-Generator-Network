Police have been called to investigate drone-flying real estate agents who use cameras to photograph and scout potential properties.

The use of the camera-equipped drones has angered Sydney residents who claim the real estate agents are invading homeowners' privacy.

A woman in Mosman, in Sydney's northern suburbs, phoned police last week after seeing a mini helicopter drone outside the kitchen window of her top floor apartment.

She was told it was a real estate agent's drone who was 'scoping for properties'.

'I got a shock. At first i thought it was a plane in the distance. I could see flashing lights and realised it was a drone. What are they looking at? What are they scoping for. It's crazy,' the woman, who didn't want to be named, told the Mosman Daily.

Police investigating found the real estate agent in question had the appropriate papers to fly the drone and had not committed an offence.

The practice of real estate agents flying drones to take advertising photos of properties is legal as long as the operator has approval.

Rules for flying drones is covered under Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) legislation and commercial operators must meet certain licensing requirements in order to use them.

There are more than 100 approved operators currently in Australia.

The CASA forced a South Australian agency to ground its drones last month after it emerged they did not have approval to fly drones for commercial purposes.

Toop&Toop's managing director, Anthony Toop, said the company wasn't aware there were legal issues when they first started using the drones.

'We ordered the first ones from the States. Our trials were fantastic – the results were so much better than we could ever have imagined,' Mr Toop told Property Observer.

'Because we are a very high profile company, we weren’t going to play with that at all. We just shut it down (when CASA served the desist notice).'

Peter Gibson from CASA said drone operators needed to undergo training and submit materials for approval.

'If you’re a real estate agent and using a drone to take photographs of clients’ homes, you should either be using an approved remotely piloted aircraft operator, of which there are about 110, or you need to get an operators certificate and approval from CASA,' Mr Gibson said.

Drone models range from a few hundred dollars to roughly $8,000.
