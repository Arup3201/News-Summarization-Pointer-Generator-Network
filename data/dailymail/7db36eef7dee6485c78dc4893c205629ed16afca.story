A prison officer who smuggled drugs and alcohol into a jail for an inmate she fell in love with after having sex with him at work has been today jailed for a year.

Hannah Stewart, 28, of Featherstone, Staffordshire, fell for Andrelle Leedham, 26, after they struck up a relationship at HMP Featherstone, near Wolverhampton.

The pair met in the education department of the Category C jail where Leedham had a prison job as a cleaner before he wooed her with his ‘smooth-talk’ and charm, Stafford Crown Court was told.

They would meet up for secret sex sessions in a cleaning cupboard. Stewart even wrote love letters to her ‘gorgeous baby’ while he was in prison for blackmail, telling him: ‘I seriously love you.’

Leedham was released in August last year and convinced his new lover to smuggle a package into the jail three months later in November.

But she was caught with the contraband - containing seven mobile phones, cannabis, anabolic steroids, whiskey and vodka - inside a sports bag in which she had carried her lunch.

Stewart admitted conspiracy to smuggle drugs into the jail and misconduct in a public office. On Friday she was jailed for 12 months at Derby Crown Court.

Sentencing, Recorder Peter Cookes said: ‘It is quite clear there was a degree of physical intimacy between the two of you when he was still a prisoner.

‘However, it is not necessary for me to decide what acts you were engaged in at that stage. Things accelerated thereafter and he devised a number of tactics to get you to do what he wanted.

‘I am alive to your compelling personal mitigation and the difficulties ex-prison officers face in the custodial environment. But the public would think I had taken leave of my senses if you were spared a term of immediate imprisonment.’

Her sentence was reduced because she gave vital evidence against the three men - including her ex-lover - who were also involved in the plot.

Leedham, from Blakenhall, West Midlands, was jailed for four years on November 11 after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply drugs following a week-long trial.

Prosecutor Gerard Quirke said: ‘She provided key evidence in this case.’

Leedham’s trial heard that on November 21 last year, Stewart picked up the contraband from the home of his mother before travelling to the prison for work the next day. 

Stewart hid the bag in a cupboard in the education department where she was passed a message from Leedham by inmate Christopher Lewis.

The 38-year-old told her to wait and give the package to another inmate Ricardo Edwards, 31, who approached her shortly after and asked: ‘Is that for me?’

Edwards and Lewis were detained and the package was recovered, which was found to have Leedham’s fingerprints on.

Edwards, who is serving an indeterminate sentence for robbery, and Lewis, who is in Featherstone for supplying heroin, each admitted conspiring to supply the drug. They were both jailed for two years and three months.

Mark Nicholls, defending, said: ‘Giving evidence against the other defendants gave her a great deal of concern for safety reasons but she knew it was the right thing to do.

‘She was charmed by Leedham and made a significant mistake.’

Giving evidence, Stewart told the court how she had succumbed to Leedham’s charm and fell for the inmate before they broke up following a short fling.

She said: ‘He made me feel good about myself. He told me I was attractive, that he would like to get to know me and one day would have me.

‘At first I just ignored him but he continued to say how beautiful I was, how he had feelings for me and wanted to be with me when he got out.

‘I believed him. I should have reported him but did not. I had started to like him. I wrote the letter to him the week before he was released and it accurately reflected my feelings towards him.’
