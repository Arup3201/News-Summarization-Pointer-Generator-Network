A man has died after the car he was driving plunged 400ft into the sea from Beachy Head.

Lifeboat crews were stunned to find the driver alive on a beach at the foot of the cliff after he was thrown clear of his vehicle when it plummeted from the headland in East Sussex yesterday evening.

He was rushed to hospital by the coastguard helicopter after lifeboats battled 'dreadful' conditions to reach the scene, but later died.

Incredibly the driver of the car, seen in the water at the bottom of the cliff, initially survived the fall, but later died in hospital

Police are now investigating how and why the car went over the cliff.

The vehicle plunged from Beachy Head to the east of the lighthouse at around 6.23pm yesterday evening.

Eastbourne lifeboats battled choppy surf as the night drew in to reach the beach at the base of the headland, where they discovered the driver still alive.

The lifeboat doctor was transferred ashore to administer first aid and to stabilise his condition.

He was transferred with the lifeboat doctor to a coastguard helicopter and taken directly to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton.

But a Sussex Police spokesman confirmed that the man died in hospital later.

Eastbourne RNLI spokesman Bob Jeffery said: 'The man was thrown from the vehicle and when we got there we were expecting the worst but we found he was alive and luckily we had the doctor onboard.

'It was dreadful conditions in the dark and with a heavy surf and one crewman had to swim ashore as we could not get the inshore lifeboat in.

'The operation took around three-and-a-half hours as the coastguard helicopter had to come back to pick up the crew who went ashore.'
