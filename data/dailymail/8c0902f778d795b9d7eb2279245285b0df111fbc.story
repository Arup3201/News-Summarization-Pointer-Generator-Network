Loss: Constable Philippa Reynolds, who died following a car smash in Londonderry. Two men have now been charged in connection with her death

Two men are due in court today to 
face charges over the death of a 'beautiful and bubbly' policewoman whose patrol car was hit by
a stolen 4x4 in Northern Ireland.

Constable
Philippa Reynolds, 27, from the Greater Belfast area, died when the 
unmarked car she was travelling in turned into the path of the vehicle 
in Londonderry in the early hours of Saturday.

One
of the men, aged 25, has been charged with ten offences, including 
causing death by dangerous driving, aggravated vehicle taking causing 
death or grievous bodily injury, burglary and driving while unfit.

The
other man, aged 23, has been charged with aggravated vehicle taking 
causing death or grievous bodily injury, burglary, criminal damage and 
assisting an offender.

They are both due to appear at Derry Magistrates' Court today.

Ms Reynolds, a former teacher, had been in the Police Service of Northern Ireland for two years.

Her
commander in Derry, Chief Superintendent Stephen Cargin, said the 
officer was one of the most enthusiastic he had worked with

He added: 'She was enthusiastic, bubbly and had a beautiful personality. She was just loved by her colleagues and she turned that love to the community she served.'

'She was a young 27-year-old officer,
just two years' service, in the prime of her life, doing what she loved
to do - and that was serving the community to the best of her ability,'
he said.

'Her colleagues are devastated, as I am as her commander, as we all are as a police service.'

Mr
Cargin said he believed the officer, who was sitting in the rear 
driver's side seat, would have died instantly due to the force of the 
impact with the silver Toyota Land Cruiser in Limavady Road.

Two other officers in the patrol car suffered non-serious injuries. The patrol car was turning a corner when the 4x4 hit it side on.

Aftermath: Forensic officers study the scene around the car Constable Reynolds had been travelling in

Wreckage: A crumpled 4x4 remained at the scene while police gathered evidence

Line of duty: Constable Reynolds was sitting in the rear driver's seat when the vehicles collided

The commander said it could have been any vehicle turning the corner into the path of the 4x4, and added: 'It could have been anyone, it could have been a family that was struck.'

Police had been hunting for two men who made off from the scene in the direction of the Ebrington area.

The Toyota was stolen in the Gobnascale area of Derry around 3am.

Mr Cargin appealed to anyone who had seen the vehicle from that time, or who witnessed the crash, to come forward.

Northern Ireland's chief constable has vowed to bring to justice those responsible.

Matt Baggott said he was greatly saddened by the death of his colleague.

'This is a personal tragedy for her family and also for the whole Police Service,' he said.

'She was out on duty, working to keep people safe, when she died. My thoughts and prayers are with her family at this time.

'I
and my colleagues will ensure that no stone remains unturned as we work
to bring to justice those who perpetrated this crime'.

Miss Gregory was described as 'enthusiastic, bubbly and had a beautiful personality' by a fellow officer

Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said: 'This is a tragic waste of a young life in sad and reckless circumstances. Constable Reynolds died as she went about her job keeping people safe in the community she served.

'I send my sincerest condolences to her bereaved family and colleagues. And I wish the two injured officers a full and quick recovery.

'I urgently appeal to anyone with 
information to assist the PSNI in bringing the people responsible for 
Constable Reynolds' death before the courts.'

Stormont Justice Minister David Ford said his thoughts were with the policewoman's relatives and the injured officers.

'I
was shocked to hear of this tragic incident which resulted in the death
of a police constable who was carrying out her duties serving the 
community in the middle of the night,' he said.

'My thoughts and prayers are with her family at this time.

'I
also send my best wishes to the two officers injured in this incident 
for a speedy and full recovery. It is hard to imagine how they, and 
indeed the wider PSNI family, are feeling.

'This
is not the first time we have seen death and injury resulting from car 
crime. I call on those engaged in this crime to reflect on the 
consequences of their actions and stop this senseless activity.'The Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman's office has been informed.

Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward.

Fatal: The junction where the smash took place. Two other officers were also injured by the collision

The Limavady Road at its junction with Glendermott Road and Clooney Terrace was closed while investigations were carried out.

Chairman of the Northern Ireland Policing Board Brian Rea said Ms Reynolds' colleagues would be devastated after learning of the 'terrible news'.

He said: 'On behalf of the Policing Board I would like to offer deepest condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of this young women.

'Our thoughts are also with the two police officers in the car at the time of the collision, who managed to escape without serious injuries.

'To lose a colleague, out on patrol 
protecting the community, is a terrible blow to the PSNI and I would 
appeal to anyone who has any information about this incident to go to the police immediately.'

- Brian Rea, Northern Ireland Policing Board

'To lose a colleague, out on patrol protecting the community, is a terrible blow to the PSNI and I would appeal to anyone who has any information about this incident to go to the police immediately.'

The most senior police officer in the Republic of Ireland, Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan extended his condolences.

'Our thoughts and sympathies are with our friends in Northern Ireland as they mourn the loss of their colleague,' he said.

'We also wish a speedy recovery to the officers injured in the incident.'

Stormont First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness expressed sympathy at the officer's death.

In a joint statement, the ministers said: 'This is devastating news and we want to extend our heartfelt sympathies to the Police Officer's family, friends and colleagues.

'We wish her two police officer colleagues a speedy and full recovery.

'Officers in the PSNI put their lives at risk on a daily basis to serve and protect our community and we are all truly grateful for their dedicated service.

'Those who commit a crime such as vehicle theft must realise their actions can have serious consequences. We urge anyone with information to go to the police.'
