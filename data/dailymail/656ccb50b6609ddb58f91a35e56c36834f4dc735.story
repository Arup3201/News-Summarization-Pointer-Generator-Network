As a millionaire sportsman accustomed to the world’s finest clubhouses, you’d have thought Lee Westwood might have mastered  a dignified approach to criticism.

Alas, it appears not. Especially when he has ‘been on the sherbet’.

When critics on Twitter dared question his poor performance in the final round of the US PGA Championship in Oak Hill, New York, he responded with a tirade of foul-mouthed abuse.

Imploded: Lee Westwood was attacked online after his performance at the U.S. PGA Championship in New York

Snapped: He responded to his tormenters by unleashing a volley of abuse after missing out on a trophy

The former world number one golfer told the ‘girly boy trolls’ to ‘get a life’, and boasted about how rich he was.

And when one of his detractors on 
Twitter said ‘I bet he’s been on the sherbet’, Westwood replied: ‘I’ve 
had lots!’  The 40-year-old snapped after failing to take home the 
trophy on Sunday.

When a user asked whether he might ‘learn how to putt’, he replied, ‘will you get a life first’.

Other fans also criticised his play at the championship, which followed a string of disappointments at other tournaments.

Another major disappointment: Westwood was in contention up until the start of the fourth round

In reply, he ranted: ‘You minions need to live from the inside out rather than the outside in!!!!’

'Like I give a f*** what the haters say. That’s life. Some people will always be just a little bit better and work just a little bit harder'

Westwood added: ‘Just sick of negative a******** sat behind a keyboard with a pitiful life’.

He continued: ‘Like I give a f*** what
the haters say! That’s life! Some people will always be just a little 
bit better and work just a little bit harder.’

Goading his critics, he boasted about 
his £2million earnings: ‘Come on you girly boy trolls! I’ve only won 
just over 2 mill on course this year! Need you to keep me entertained a 
bit longer than this!’ He seemed pleased with his handiwork when nobody 
bothered to reply.

‘Ahhh just when I’m in the mood the 
haters all go quiet!’, Westwood said. ‘Obviously didn’t like a bit back 
at em!’ The golf star explained: ‘I love slagging people back! Had 
enough of sitting there taking it. Bring it on!’

When Twitter users rose to the 
challenge, Westwood had yet more choice words for those who had dared to
highlight his failure to win a golf major.

Turning his fire on one tweeter who 
claimed he deserved ‘all the stick’, Westwood, from Worksop in 
Nottinghamshire, declared: ‘I tried all the way. And you’re a t***!’.

Another poster was given short shrift 
by the golfer after he suggested he could not handle criticism. Westwood
replied: ‘Not from unachieving (sic) low life’s. No!’.

One user urged Westwood to ‘go to 
bed’, while others suggested  that the golfer might have been wise to 
avoid Twitter while less than sober.

Footballer Joey Barton got involved and received a strong reply from Westwood.

Barton congratulated him on his ‘good 
old twitter rant’, to which Westwood said: ‘Get to training Joey! You 
need to run a bit of fat off!’ Barton replied: ‘Note to twitter users. 
Tweet sober.’

Another user also questioned 
Westwood’s sobriety, writing: ‘Has someone hacked your account Lee.. 
drink doesn’t solve anything!’ In reply, Westwood said: ‘oh it does! 
Plenty!’

Despite having briefly been the 
world’s top golfer, when he ended the reign of Tiger Woods in 2010, 
Westwood has never won a major championship. He has been in contention 
for all four major golfing trophies this year but has let them slip 
through his grasp.

Not quite: Westwood has suffered numerous close major finishes but has not managed to get across the line

Westwood co-owns a private jet and lives in a villa in Florida overlooking the 14th fairway of the Old Palm Golf Club.

He and his wife, Laurae, and their two children, Sam, 12, and Poppy, nine, moved into their mansion in February this year.

The £3.8million mansion is 15,000 sq ft, with five bedrooms and a palm tree fringed swimming pool.

Last night, some six hours after his 
rant, Westwood appeared to have had a change of heart, tweeting: 
‘Sincere apologies to my sponsors and true followers for my earlier 
comments.

‘It was out of order and out of character, Westy.’
