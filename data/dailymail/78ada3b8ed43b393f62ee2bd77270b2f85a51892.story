A New Jersey soccer mom sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for trying to hire a hit man to kill her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend has spoken for the first time about what drove her to the murder-the-hire plot.

She has even apologized to the victim for trying to have her murdered.

Nicole Faccenda, 45, of Lyndhurst, N.J., is in prison in West Virginia after being caught in an undercover police sting in 2011, ABC News reported.

Faccenda was introduced to a man she thought was a killer in the parking lot of a Mahwah, N.J., supermarket, however the man was an undercover officer with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- the ATF.

Apologized: Nicole Faccenda, 45, of New Jersey, has public said sorry to the woman she tried to have murdered, after being caught in an undercover sting in 2011

While all there meetings were being secretly recorded, Faccenda was suspicious the man may have been agent, refusing to explicitly say she wanted the woman dead, saying she has 'watched too many Lifetime movies'.

She used turns of phrase like she 'wants to be dressed in black', referring to a funeral, and wanted the new girlfriend 'gone to the moon'.

However after a few phone conversations Faccenda inevitably let her guard down, and she soon handed over a $2,000 down payment with the promise of another $18,000 when the woman was dead and she could go to her funeral and 'p--- on her grave'.

She also provided a picture of the intended target, along with her address.

As for her ex-boyfriend, she said she didn't want him killed, but it would be all right for the hit man to shoot him in the foot.

She had less concern for the other woman's children. If they got in the way, she said: 'Oh well, I'm sorry.'

Faccenda was arrested after the week-long ATF operation.

Stung: This is the moment Nicole Faccenda first met with whom she believed to be a hit man, in the carpark of a supermarket in Manwah. The man was an undercover officer and the meeting was being filmed and recorded

Suspcious: This footage, taken inside the car by an undercover cop, shows Nicole Faccenda looking directly at the camera that was secretly filming her. She also refused to discuss the murder-for-hire explicity, saying: 'I want to wear black.'

She later pleaded guilty and, in December 2013, was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

She has now decided to talk openly about her crime and sent a series of emails to ABC about why she did it.

Faccenda hopes that, by speaking out, she may be able to help other women from landing in the same position.

'My message to any woman who has had her heart broken and has felt the pain of loss in every bone in her body ... is to take a deep breath and think before speaking,' she said via email.

'Your words are powerful weapons and you will be held accountable for them and it is definitely not worth it.

'I know in my heart that if it were not for the persistence and constant pressure from the CI (Confidential Informant) and the ATF agents wanting to make their case, I would not be here today.

'I was at an emotional low point in my life and they took advantage of that.

However Faccenda goes on to say she takes responsibility for her actions.

'I thank God every day that no one got hurt from my careless actions,' she wrote.

'I will be indebted to my family and friends for their support. I would like to apologize to the victim and her family.

'I am not  - and have never been - a violent person. I was a woman destroyed by emotions and I am paying for it dearly.'
