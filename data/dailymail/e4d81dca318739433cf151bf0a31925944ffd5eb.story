Property guru Sarah Beeny has called for the Government to give tax breaks to three-generation families living under one roof.

The television presenter said ‘multi-generation living’ would help to avert a social care ‘disaster’ because family members could more easily care for elderly relatives at home.

It would also ease Britain’s housing shortage by freeing up more homes – pushing down prices and bursting the property ‘bubble’.

By caring for older relative ourselves, we would reduce the huge financial pressure on the State caused by an ageing population, she said.

It would also reduce our reliance on childcare and after-school clubs because grandparents could care for their grandchildren while their children went out to work.

The married mother-of-four relies on a nanny to help with childcare and admitted she would ‘love it’ if her own father or parents’-in-law moved in with her.

As the owner of Rise Hall – a 28-bedroom mansion in Yorkshire – and a Victorian cottage in Streatham, south London, she would not be a typical example for multi-generational living.

But yesterday, she called for Britain to learn from Mediterranean countries, where three generations more commonly lived together.

The presenter of shows such as Property Ladder and How to Sell your House criticised planning restrictions which bowed too much to nimbys (not in my back yard) and prevented people from turning their homes into ones big enough for several generations.

Miss Beeny says the plans would also ease Britain’s housing shortage by freeing up more homes – pushing down prices and bursting the property bubble

She said: ‘I would really like to see encouragement of three-generational living.

‘It should be incentivised in terms of tax and in terms of planning.

‘Instead of saying, ‘we have got a housing problem but we won’t let anyone extend their home by three inches’, why don’t we just let the person do their loft conversion.

‘I think nimbyism is still a problem, massively. I mean, we are nimbys in this country aren’t we?’.

‘I would have tax incentives, as well, for three generations living together, maybe council tax breaks.’

She said that, ‘at the moment we have got a disaster waiting to happen with the cost of looking after older people’, but there is little planning to deal with this ‘cost around the corner’.

She added: ‘Meanwhile we are encouraging parents to go to work but then you give it all back in tax and pay a load more for childcare. You are busting a gut the kids don’t see you.

‘We have got parents who are too busy to help their children with their homework so we are paying for extra homework clubs.

‘The burden on the taxpayer of trying to pay for all these services is huge. It is much more efficient to take out the layers of bureaucracy.’

She added that it would ‘loosen up housing problems in this country because there would be a lot more properties available’.

‘It also encourages generations to look out for each other. It should be our mantra going forwards – let’s try to fix the whole concept of family responsibility’, she said.

But even with two large homes, she admits she has not yet managed to convince her own family to live with her.

Miss Beeny and her artist husband Graham Swift bought Grade II listed 97-room Rise Hall in 2001 for £435,000 when it was in complete disrepair and made a programme, Beeny’s Restoration Nightmare, about the long, painful renovation to its former glory.

But her father Richard, a retired architect, is reluctant to move in with his daughter and son-in-law and their four energetic young sons Billy, Charlie, Rafferty and Laurie.

She said: ‘I would love it but the funny thing is that my dad isn’t that keen. He just went "are you mad?".

‘Rise Hall is full of weddings and London he wouldn’t want to live in because it’s busy and it’s manic and everyone ignores each other.

‘And we have a million children. I think they are lovely, but they are four boys. It’s like having a litter of kittens around or puppies.

‘It is something I would really love to do – and with my mother-in-law and father-in-law too.

‘Graham and I talk endlessly about if we should leave London because I can see how it would work if we had a house and a separate annex, so they could have their own kitchen and their own bit of garden that they could go in and have a cup of tea without the kids going in.

‘My theory is that we would get somewhere with an annex and make it so nice and invite them to stay. Eventually, they will say "I might as well stay" and I will say "well, why not hey."'

Miss Beeny, who runs an online estate agents called Tepilo, called for urgent reform of the stamp duty land tax system, which she said was ‘blocking the market’, claiming that the incremental system was ‘madness’.

She argued the scheme would also reduce our reliance on childcare and after-school clubs because grandparents could care for their grandchildren while their children went out to work

Stamp duty jumps up rather than rising gradually and costs buyers at least £7,000 for a home over £250,000 and £20,000 for a house above £500,000.

She said: ‘There is no possible logic behind it. It is ridiculous, we have to get rid of the incremental system’.

Stamp duty thresholds have also failed to rise with house prices, meaning more middle-class families are now caught by the tax once intended for the wealthy.

Miss Beeny, 42, said: ‘In London, people with half a million pound properties are not wandering around with houses in the Caribbean and gold Rolls Royces.

‘They are people who work their butts off, both of them working full-time busting a gut, both working 15-hours a day so these are not loaded people with million pound bonuses.’

Miss Beeny also criticised Ed Miliband’s plans for a mansion tax on all homes over £2 million. Labour has pledged to introduce the additional tax if they win the general election.

She added: ‘I think it’s too low in my opinion, it sounds awful to say £2 million isn’t that much, but it sort of isn’t in some areas.

‘A long time ago, if you had a £2 million house, you would have staff and several cars.

‘But these are normal people who do their own washing and I slightly think it seems as if the threshold is slightly low.’
