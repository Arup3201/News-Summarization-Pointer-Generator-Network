President Obama has hit back at Michael Jordan's claims he's a 's***ty golfer' - and suggested he pays more attention to his struggling basketball team.

The NBA legend made the quip about the president in an interview with former NFL star Ahmad Rashad last month, adding that he wouldn't play a round of golf with Obama because he's a 'hack'.

But the commander-in-chief appeared to laugh off the criticisms as he spoke to Wisconsin radio station WJMR, saying he once played on a team with Rashad and won.

'Michael wasn't very well informed about this,' he said. 'I think he just might have been trying to give Ahmad an extra ratings boost on his show.'

Having the last laugh: President Obama reponded to Michael Jordan's criticism of his golf ability by suggesting the basketball legend focuses less on his game and more on his losing basketball team

Not happy: Jordan reacts to a call during a Hornets game in 2013 - the team is currently 1-3 down

He went on: 'But there is no doubt that Michael is a better golfer than I am. Of course if I was playing twice a day for the last 15 years, then that might not be the case.

'He might want to spend more time thinking about the Bobcats... or the Hornets.'

Jordan owns the Hornets, which are currently down 1-3.

The jab came a week after the basketball legend made the remarks during an interview for Back9 with Rashad, who asked him who he would pick for his 'foursome' in a round of golf.  

First Jordan, 51, said he would choose golfing legend Arnold Palmer, and he then named Obama.

'I've never played with Obama, but I would,' he said, before promptly changing his mind. 'But no - that's OK - I'd take him out. He's a hack. I'd be there all day playing with him.'

'Do you really want to say that?' Rashad asked, looking at the camera, bemused. 'He's the President of the United States - he's a hack?'

Jordan added: 'I never said he wasn't a great politician. I'm just saying he's a s***ty golfer.'  

Not up to par: President Barack Obama, left, who has played 200 rounds of golf since being in office, has a handicap of around 18, while Jordan, pictured right, has an impressive 3 handicap

Teed off: Obama has spent more time golfing than he has spent listening to daily intelligence briefings

Jordan has a 3 handicap, according to Golf Digest. Obama by comparison 'strives' for a handicap of 18, Don Van Natta Jr., who tracks presidential golfing habits, recently told The New York Times.   

The president played his 200th round of golf while in office earlier this month - a staggering number considering Tiger Woods has played around 270 games in that time.

Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former President Bill Clinton and Republican House Speaker John Boehner have all teed off with Obama at some point.  

But even though his obsession has been the butt of Republican jokes, he's far from reaching the presidential record.

According to Van Natta's book, First Off the Tee, Woodrow Wilson was estimated to have played 1,200 rounds of golf in office, but it could have been as high as 1,600. 

Dwight Eisenhower is the runner-up at 800. He even set up a green outside the Oval Office and visited Augusta National so often that he got his own cabin on the club's grounds.
