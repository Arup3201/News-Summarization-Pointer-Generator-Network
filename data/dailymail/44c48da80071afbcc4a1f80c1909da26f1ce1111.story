Google waded into Russia's gay-rights row as the Winter Games in Sochi launched today by updating its iconic search page logo to depict athletes skiing, sledding, curling and skating against a rainbow-colored backdrop.

The rainbow flag has been a symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender pride since the 1970s.

The company declined to comment on the new Google Doodle that appeared on its home pages worldwide, saying it wanted the illustration to speak for itself.

But the logo clearly was meant as a show of support for gay rights and a rebuke of the law that bans pro-gay 'propaganda' that could be accessible to minors.

Below the updated logo appears a two-sentence section of the Olympic charter that reads, in part, 'The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practicing sport, without discrimination of any kind.'

Strong statement: The company declined to comment on the new Google Doodle that appeared on its home pages worldwide, saying it wanted the illustration to speak for itself

'Google has made a clear and unequivocal statement that Russia's anti-LGBT discrimination is indefensible,' said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, whose Washington-based group has been lobbying American corporations, especially those sponsoring the Games in Sochi, to condemn the law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in July.

It went on: 'Now it's time for each and every remaining Olympic sponsor to follow their lead. The clock is ticking, and the world is watching.'

Although Google is not an Olympics sponsor, its action came a day after three sponsors of the U.S. Olympic Committee - AT&T, DeVry University and yogurt maker Chobani - issued statements explicitly speaking out against the Russian law.

Carefully-timed: Google's timing meant it would be seen in Russia today, when the Games' opening ceremonies will be held. The local time in Sochi is 12 hours ahead of California, where Google is headquartered (pictured)

Google typically updates its themed daily Doodles at midnight Eastern time, but the Olympics-gay pride version made its debut in the late afternoon.

While Google is not as popular in Russia as it is in the U.S., the timing meant it would be seen in Russia on Friday, when the Games' opening ceremonies will be held. The local time in Sochi is 12 hours ahead of California, where Google is headquartered.

Google and its founders have been outspoken supporters of gay rights since 2008, when the company got involved in the campaign to defeat a gay marriage ban on the California ballot.

Fury: They are angry over a law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in July bans pro-gay 'propaganda' that could be accessible to minors

Restrictive: Critics say the law is so restrictive that it forbids almost any public expression of support for gay rights

In 2012 it launched a global workplace safety campaign, called 'Legalise Love,' that it described as a call to decriminalize homosexuality and eliminate homophobia around the world.

A public kiss between two men could be defined as illegal 'homosexual propaganda' and bring a fine of up to £10,000 if the bill that comes up for a first vote this month becomes law in Russia.

The legislation being pushed by the Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church would make it illegal to tell minors information that is defined as ‘propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality and transgenderism.’

It includes a ban on holding public events that promote gay rights.

The bill is part of an effort to promote traditional Russian values as opposed to Western liberalism, which the Kremlin and church see as corrupting Russian youth and contributing to a wave of protest against President Vladimir Putin's rule.

Other laws that the Kremlin says are intended to protect young Russians have been adopted in recent months, including some that allow banning and blocking web content and print publications that are deemed ‘extremist’ or unfit for young audiences.

The company also recognizes gay pride season each year by customizing search boxes to turn rainbow-colored when terms like 'gay' and 'gay pride' are entered.

A U.S. Olympic sponsor and U.N. panel condemned Russia's law which has been criticized
as a stifling of gay rights.

The law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in July bans pro-gay 'propaganda' that could be accessible to minors. Critics say it is so 
restrictive that it forbids almost any public expression of support for 
gay rights.

Last month, for example, a newspaper editor in Russia's Far 
East was fined 50,000 rubles ($1,400) for publishing an interview with a
gay school teacher who defended homosexuality.

The International Olympic Committee and its corporate sponsors are being pressed to denounce 
the law and call for its repeal. A campaign was launched on several fronts 
in July that included a boycott of Russian vodka.

McDonald's,
 a sponsor of the Sochi Olympics, was targeted 
Wednesday by protesters in London and Paris, where about 50 people 
gathered in front of one of the fast-food chain's restaurants in the 
Place de la Republique square to chant 'No to Russia's anti-gay law!' 
and carry banners with slogans such as 'Russia we are with you but we're
against your anti-gay law.'

In
London, about 150 people rallying outside Prime Minister David 
Cameron's office in London urged McDonald's and the International Olympic Committee's other sponsors
to speak out. The activists there said they plan to deliver a petition 
signed by more than 100,000 people to a nearby McDonald's restaurant.

Russian gay rights activists marched along a Moscow boulevard in downtown with banners reading 'Down with all Kinds of Fascism' and 'Bisexuals Against Fascism'

In downtown St. Petersburg, hundreds of miles north of Sochi, about a 
dozen Russian gay rights activists also protested.

Two unfurled banners 
reading 'Berlin 1936 = Sochi 2014,' referring to the Olympic Games held 
in Nazi Germany. Single person protests are legal in Russia, and the two
activists holding signs were spaced far enough apart that neither was 
arrested.
