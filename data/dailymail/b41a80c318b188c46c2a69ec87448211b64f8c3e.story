You might expect them to have be concerned for the welfare of another ancient collection of stones, famous the world over.

But the Rolling Stones are at the centre of a row over a date in their forthcoming world tour which it is feared will do 'irreparable damage' to one of the glories of Ancient Rome - the Circus Maximus.

The legendary British rockers - Mick Jagger, 70, Ronnie Wood, 66, Kieth Richards, 70, and Charlie Watts, 72 - are scheduled to perform on June 22 at the 2000 year old chariot racing stadium, immortalised in the film Ben Hur.

Danger: The decision to bring 65,000 fans into a fragile archeological site (which has become a venue for rallies and concerts in recent decades) has led to outcry, with conservation experts warning of 'unpredictable consequences'

But the decision to bring 65,000 fans into a fragile archeological site has led to outcry, with conservation experts warning of ‘unpredictable consequences’.

The city’s culture tsar Maria Rosaria Barbera, who opposes the concert, wrote in a ministry document: ‘The choice of the Circus Maximus for the Rolling Stones concert brings a measure of risk for the heritage of the area that is not only heightened but also hard to predict.’

Citing the ‘irreparable damage' that had been inflicted on the 'particularly fragile area' in recent years by football fans, she said the Stones concert 'might provoke acts of vandalism and movement of people towards the emerging monuments.'

'Unacceptable incumbrance': The 120 foot-wide stage and the four 50 ft lighting towers were 'an unacceptable incumbrance for an area of special merit', a local official said (pictured: Circus Maxims stadium in during Rome's 2005 Live 8 concert)

The 120 foot-wide stage and the four 50 ft lighting towers were ‘an unacceptable incumbrance for an area of special merit ’, she added.

Politicians have also waded into the debate. Centre right MP Luciano Ciochetti said: ‘As well as the archeological risks for the site there, the area all around the Circus Maximum will have to be closed for days with heavy consequences for traffic in a season that is already supporting the maximum number of tourists.’

But city mayor Ignazio Marino is hoping to use the concert a a springboard for an entire weekend of cultural events that will raise his profile and boost spending by tourists.

Happy to be back: The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Charlie Watts, arrived in Perth, Australia, early on Monday morning and looked thrilled to be back

Heyday: The band's combined age now is 278

Mr Marino, who said putting on a Stones concert had been his 'dream’ since being elected last year, wrote to an Italian newspaper: ‘The passionate chords of their rock in the archaeological heart of the city will be yet another demonstration of the great beauty of Rome.’

He said he hoped ‘to transform Circus Maximus into a landmark for major cultural events.’

And Mick Jagger tweeted in Italian: ‘I can't wait for the European tour to start. It's a very beautiful time of year to play.’

The Circus Maximus has been used for other pop concerts in the past with Genesis and Lady Gaga playing there in recent years. Bob Geldof's Live 8 concert was held there in 2005.

But the site is currently under restoration. Archeologists have continued to discover Roman artefacts including ancient coins, wheels and saucepans as well as the remains of ancient taverns.
