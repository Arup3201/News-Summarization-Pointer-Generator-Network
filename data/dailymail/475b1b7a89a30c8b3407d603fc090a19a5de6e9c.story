There were dramatic scenes in court last night as the judge declared a mistrial over the sentencing of Jodi Arias after the jury failed to reach a unanimous 
verdict over whether or not she should be executed for 
murdering her ex-boyfriend.

The jury was dismissed from the courtroom after spending five months on the case, and while they did decide that she was guilty of the premeditated murder of Travis Alexander, they could not decide whether she should spend life in prison or be put to death.

The next step in the lengthy trial will now come on July 18, when an entirely new jury panel is determined and tasked with delivering the final verdict in the case.

In tears: Jodi Arias looked frightened before the jury's non-decision was handed down, but her composure did not change dramatically after she realized that she was not being sentenced to death

Heartbroken: Travis Alexander's relatives, including his sister Tanisha (right) were a constant presence at the trial and they were moved to tears when they heard that it would drag on for more months

The scene in the Phoenix, Arizona courtroom on Thursday afternoon- when the jury came back to the judge with their inability to agree- was not one of relief.

Arias herself looked upset and began crying, though not necessarily tears of joy.

Alexander's siblings, who have been a constant presence throughout and have all uprooted their lives in California to focus on the trial, were all crying as well.

One female juror was at least sympathetic to them, and she was seen mouthing the word 'sorry' toward the Alexanders.

Judge Sherry Stephens, who showed some tough love to the jury yesterday, was very complimentary to them today.

'This was not your typical trial. You were asked to perform some very difficult duties,' she said.

Mistrial: Jody Arias reacts as the jury indicates it has not been able to reach a decision on the death penalty

The jury began deliberating Tuesday, and on Wednesday afternoon they told the Judge that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict.

She ordered the jurors
to go back and talk more until they came to a decision, but that was still not enough time as they came back later yesterday afternoon still at an impasse.

The new jury will not have any power 
to change her guilty conviction, and they will be solely tasked with 
determining how she will 'pay' for the first degree murder.

The
decision follows a trial that has staggered on for five months over the
2008 slaying of Travis Alexander, Arias' on-again off-again boyfriend 
who she killed in his home in 2008. She stabbed him nearly 30 times, 
slit his throat, and shot him.

Fearful: Arias was surrounded by her legal team, and her relatives were not in the room though they had been regularly fixtures at the trial through much of the five months

Even
for the most fastidious of court followers who have developed a sense 
of who Arias is over the past five months of the trial, her behavior in 
the past week has been confusing as she gave conflicting statements 
about her desire thoughts on a possible death sentence.

Immediately after her guilty verdict 
was handed down two weeks ago, she granted a local news station an 
interview where she said that she was 'in shock' and that she would 
rather be given the death penalty as opposed to a life sentence in 
prison.

Speaking to the local Fox affiliate KSAZ, Arias said that she would 'prefer to die sooner than later.'

â€˜Longevity
runs in my family, and I don't want to spend the rest of my natural 
life in one place. I'm pretty healthy, I don't smoke and I'll probably 
live for a long time so that's not something that I am looking forward 
to.

'I believe death is the ultimate freedom and I'd rather have my freedom as soon as I can get it.'

Waiting game: Now the next jury will be impaneled on July 18 and this second portion of the trial- where the jury needs to determine the punishment for Arias- will be done for a second time

Those
comments prompted courthouse officials to order that she be placed in a
psychological hold and on suicide watch, which inevitably delayed the 
second portion of the sentencing- where jurors were forced to decide if 
the murder was especially aggressive.

During the ensuing testimony, called 
the aggravation portion of the trial, jurors heard from both sides who 
were able to call witnesses arguing that she should and shouldn't be 
forced to die, respectively.

When
she addressed the court in her own defense, she she pledged, if allowed
to live, to donate her hair to cancer patients and start a prison 
recycling program.

'I have 
made many public statements that I would prefer the death penalty to 
life in prison,' Arias told jurors. In each of those cases, 'I lacked 
perspective,' she said.

'Until
very recently I could not imagine standing before you all and asking 
for you to give me life,' she said. 'But as I stand here now I cannot in
good conscience ask you to sentence me to death.'

@highlight

The jury could not come to a unanimous decision about whether to execute Jodi Arias or to sentence her to life in prison

@highlight

They were the group that spent five months listening to graphic details about the 2008 murder of Travis Alexander

@highlight

Now a new jury must be called and they will be forced to decide what Jodi Arias' sentence should be for the premeditated murder

@highlight

The new jury will not be able to override the guilty verdict

Move draws out the case longer as the new jury won't be called until July
