A total of 31 allegations of rape have been made against Jimmy Savile, police revealed yesterday.

Detectives said they had received 199 complaints of sex attacks against the late BBC star from 450 different people.

Savile is said to have carried out the attacks in 17 police force areas.

Detectives said that 589 complainants –
the majority of which were young girls at the times of the alleged 
attacks – had contacted police as part of a wider inquiry into sexual 
attacks carried out by Savile and others.

Commander Peter Spindler said a report
into Savile's crimes will be published in the New Year. He said: 'These
levels of reporting of sexual abuse against a single individual are 
unprecedented.'

Meanwhile, an inquiry is under way 
into allegations of a paedophile ring at the top of British society, 
Scotland Yard confirmed last night.

Detectives are examining claims 
senior politicians abused children in the 1980s and escaped justice 
because of their powerful connections.

The investigation, codenamed Operation
Fairbank, has been operating in secret since the claims were first made
by MP Tom Watson in October.

Scotland Yard has arrested six men 
and questioned a seventh since complaints against Savile and other TV 
personalities were triggered by a TV documentary.

Among those interviewed are PR 
consultant Max Clifford, comedian Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis and 
paedophile Gary Glitter. They all deny any wrongdoing

Savile, who died last year aged 84, is
now accused of being one of the most prolific sex attackers and 
paedophiles in modern history.

He told MPs that police should 
investigate claims of a 'powerful paedophile ring' linked to Parliament.
Police stressed the operation is a 'scoping exercise' rather than a 
full inquiry, but sources said arrests could be made within weeks.

A raft of inquiries have been launched since the scandal unfolded, including three BBC reviews.

A Department of Health investigation 
is looking at Savile's activities at Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville 
Hospital and Leeds General Infirmary.

Other inquiries include the director 
of public prosecutions' review into the decision not to prosecute the DJ
and TV presenter in 2009.
