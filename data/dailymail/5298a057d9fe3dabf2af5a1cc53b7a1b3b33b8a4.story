Krokodil Victim? Justin McGee died in November last year and now authorities in Oklahoma suspect that he may have perished as a result of his use of krokodil

Worried authorities are working to determine if the flesh eating drug krokodil has claimed its first victims in America, after the gruesome death of an Oklahoma father-of-four and his friend.

The Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics suspects that Justin McGee, 33, died as a result of complications from his use of the potent new drug that eats the body from inside out.

Both McGee and his unidentified friend had such horrific skin damage that they were treated in the hospital burns unit their deaths said Dr. William Banner, director of the Oklahoma Poison Control Center.

If it is confirmed that McGree perished using the terrifying new drug, which is responsible for thousands of deaths in Russia and is made from codeine and gasoline, it will represent a serious escalation for the spread of krokodil which is being dubbed the 'poor man's meth'.

'We were reluctant to publish it,' Dr. Banner tells The Verge. 'But now that it’s out there, we really want the message to be, ‘This is an end game move. This is going to kill you.’

McGee was admitted to hospital in Oklahoma City in November and died of a heart attack, but his autopsy results revealed evidence of krokodil use - including the tell-tale symtom of missing and rotting scaly, reptilian-like skin - hence its name.

'His skin was missing,' said McGee's friend Chelle Fancher to Koco.Com.

'The doctors say it ate him from the inside out. It wasn't until the next day that they told us that is was krokodil meth.

'Everything that touched him took his skin off.'

Initially, McGee's condition was a mystery to doctors who airlifted him from his hometown of Duncan to a larger hospital in Oklahoma City.

'They said, ‘Chunks of his skin are falling off and they can’t get an IV in,' said his sister-in-law Lesia McGee to The Verge.

Krokodil, which is similar to heroin and originated in Russia 10 years ago, turns users into zombies and the homemade concoction can be up to 10 times cheaper than heroin and is created by mixing codeine with gasoline or oil.

The drug is made of readily available ingredients such as codeine, iodine and toxins such as gasoline, industrial cleaning oil, lighter fluid and paint thinner. Users filter and boil ingredients together, then inject the drug.

The results are catastrophic.

Spreading: There have now been at least eight cases of the skin-rotting Russian drug krokodil reported in the US, according to medical professionals and at least two resulted in death

The autopsy on McGee showed he was positive for desomorphine, the active ingredient in codeine, but doctors also found morphine, methamphetamine, and amphetamine.

However, at his funeral, McGee's friends, one who has since also died because of suspected krokodile use, told Lesia that they were indeed using krokodil after finding the recipe online.

'It’s manufactured very similar to methamphetamine and that's where some people may call it krokodil meth, but what it is, it’s an opiate similar to heroin,' said Mark Woodward of the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics (OBN).

The OBN has been looking into the drug since Quincy’s death last November.

'It’s possible right now that we have two deaths, and those could be just two that we are aware of,' Woodward said.

Officials with the OBN confirmed both of those victims were men from Duncan, Oklahoma.

Fancher said the two men were friends. She said Quincy was a father of four young children.

'Their dad is gone because someone chose to make an evil drug,' Fancher said. 'I was there when he took his last breath. No family member should ever go through what we saw him go through.'

This Russian man is suffering the side-effects of Krokodil use. Doctors say there are users of the drug in Chicago just weeks after first known cases in U.S. were reported in Arizona

Continual use of krokodil, Russian for crocodile, causes blood vessels to burst, leaving skin green and scaly and eventually causing gangrene.

In Russia around 30,000 people die from the affects of the drug every year. It is thought abouta quarter of a million people in the country are now hooked on the poison.

Despite this, Dr. Banner told The Verge he believes the drug to be 'self-limiting' - addicts will likely die within two years, not spread the drug and warned against any scare-mongering of an epidemic.

'This is a poor man's drug,' said Dr. Banner. 'It is kind of the end of the road. They run out of money, they’re horribly addicted. They cook it, inject it, get high, wake up and want more.'

While the Drug Enforcement Administration is not confirming any cases of deaths of usage of the drug, they have admitted they are aware of investigations in Oklahoma, Arizona, Utah and Illinois.

And in another sign the drug is spreading across the nation, following reports of  krokodil abuse in both Arizona and Chicago, Illinois, the drug is now believed to have hit New York.

A source has claimed that the drug is being sold in at least two nightclubs in New York City’s hip Meatpacking District.

The Verge reports that Sal Ramirez, who witnessed the effects of krokodil while serving in the Peace Corps in Kazakhstan, saw a man being throw out of Le Bain for selling the drug, and was approached by a deal at Westway, who reportedly tried to sell him krokodil and clean syringes in the bathroom.

The announcement comes after a worrying wave of some victims injecting themselves with krokodil because they think it is heroin, doctors said.

The first instances of its use in the U.S. were recorded in Arizona last month. It is already widely used in Russia.

Three cases have now been reported in Chicago and doctors say two of the women did not even know they had been sold the drug.

The victims were all aged between 18 and 25 and come from middle-class backgrounds.

Pictures and videos of users in Russia show blackened fingertips, large open wounds, and even exposed bone where skin has fallen off. Prolonged or even short-term use can damage blood vessels, muscle, cartilage, and bone, and amputation is frequently the only way to save a patient’s life.

Doctors have warned of the horrifying side effects of the homemade drug, which is said to give a more powerful high than heroin.

The flesh rotting that is specific to the drug occurs directly at the injection site, often leaving users with wounds to their feet or arms.
