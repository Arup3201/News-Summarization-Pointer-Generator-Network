As one of Britain's most eligible bachelors, with a string of glamourous ex-girlfriends Prince Harry is probably used to female attention.

But even the red-haired Prince turned a shade of crimson when he was he subject of an enthusiastic embrace by one fan as he greeted well-wishers at an anniversary screening of the movie Zulu.

Harry had gone to speak to members of the crowd waiting for him outside the Odeon in Leicester Square, when one woman leaned in towards him and hugged him tightly - much to the amusement of fellow fans.

Close encounter: Prince Harry got very up close and personal with this fan, who leaned in to hug him as he walked the red carpet at an anniversary screening of the movie Zulu

Blushes: Harry's cheeks seemed to turn a shade of crimson as the woman pulled him closer in a warm embrace

A hug for Harry: Harry's hug seemed to amuse fellow fans, who were desperate to take a picture of the prince

Hold me close: Harry grins as the female fan tightens her grip, but at one stage the attention seemed a little too much for the fourth-in-line to the throne

Waiting well-wishers, most of them female, took the opportunity presented by Harry seemingly trapped in the embrace to try to take a selfie with the royal, as he grinned to the assembled crowds.

After his lengthy embrace, the prince returned to his red carpet duties, when he had another close encounter - this time with Shenkin, the Royal Welsh regimental goat.

Harry, who himself is a 
commissioned officer with the Household Cavalry, grinned as he met Lance
 Corporal Shenkin and his handler, Goat Major Sergeant 'Jacko' Jackson 
at the special presentation of ZuluÂ  - which depicts what may well be Welsh soldiers' most famous engagement.

In fact called Shenkin III, the mascot is a Kashmir white goat selected from the Queen's own herd of Royal Windsor Whites and a direct descendent of the original mascot given to the 3rd Royal Welsh Regiment by Queen Victoria after the Crimean War.

Opportunity: With Harry locked in to the embrace, other fans spotted their chance to try to take a selfie with the royal

Let it go: Eventually the woman seemed to loosen her grip, allowing Harry to return to his red-carpet journey

Fond farewell: The female fan seemed thrilled at her close encounter with the prince, who told guests that Zulu was one of his favourite films

Arriving at the cinema, the Prince told Suzannah Endfield Olivier, the daughter of the film's director Cy Endfield, that Zulu was one of his favourite films.

'I watch this film every single year before Christmas time,' he said.

'Maybe once. Maybe twice.'

The film, which gave Michael Caine his first major role, has been digitally enhanced to mark the 
anniversary of its 1964 premiere, dramatises the events at Rorke's Drift where the British Army famously battled Zulu battalions in January 1879.

Hairy encounter: Prince Harry met Shenkin, the mascot of the Royal Welsh, at a special screening of Zulu in Leicester Sqaure

Meeting: The Prince was introduced to the Royal Welsh's mascot this evening when he attended a screening to mark the 50th anniversary of the film Zulu - which depicts the regiment's predecessor's most famous engagement

Face to face: The Prince chats to Goat Major Sergeant 'Jacko' Jackson as he is introduced to Shenkin

It tells the story of the 150 British
 
soldiers, many sick and wounded, who took on 4,000 Zulu warriors - with 
their efforts earning 11 Victoria Crosses. They were from the 24th of 
Foot, which went on to become the South Wales Borderers and is now The 
Royal Welsh.

Ms 
Endfield Olivier said Harry's attendance at the film was 'a validation',
 and before he told her about his Christmas tradition of watching Zulu, 
she said:'It's one of his favourite films so I'm told.'

The film's release will benefit Walking with the Wounded, Sentebale and The David Rattray Memorial Trust.

Prince
 Harry has been heavily involved with Walking with the Wounded, taking 
part in the charity's South Pole expedition last year and supporting two
 previous expeditions as a patron.

Valued: Shenkin is a direct descendent of the original mascot given to the 3rd Royal Welsh Regiment by Queen Victoria after the Crimean War

Prized: In fact called Shenkin III, the mascot is a Kashmir white goat selected from the Queen's own herd of Royal Windsor Whites

Top pick: Arriving at the cinema, the Prince told Suzannah Endfield Olivier, the daughter of the film's director Cy Endfield, that Zulu was one of his favourite films

On guard: Boer War re-enactors pose on the red carpet ahead of the 50th anniversary screening of Zulu, which dramatises the events at Rorke's Drift where the British Army famously battled Zulu battalions in January 1879

He is also a founding patron of 
Sentebale, which helps vulnerable children in Lesotho, who face extreme 
poverty and an HIV and Aids epidemic.

The David Rattray Memorial Trust helps to educate and care for children at a number of schools in Kwa-Zulu Natal.

The release of the film, which will include never-before-seen footage, has been organised by Ms Endfield Olivier.

Role: Zulu Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who starred as his own great-grandfather King Cetshwayo in the film arrives for the screening

Prince Harry also met people 
associated with the film and charity representatives before settling in 
to watch his 'favourite' movie.

And
 Harry was not the only royal in attendance, as he shared the red carpet
 with Zulu Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who starred as his own 
great-grandfather King Cetshwayo in the film.

Prince Buthelezi, 85, was unable to attend the original premiere because of restrictions imposed by the South African apartheid government.

Guests: Nick Knowles and his wife Jessica, and boyband Blake, who have also supported the Walking With The Wounded charity, were among the guests at the screening
