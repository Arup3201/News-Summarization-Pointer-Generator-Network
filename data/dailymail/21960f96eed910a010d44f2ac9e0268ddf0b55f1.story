A series of intimate behind-the-scenes photos aboard Air Force One have revealed the moment George W. Bush proudly showed off his artwork to Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama - and they look impressed.

Other images reveal him sharing a 
joke with the president and casually chatting ahead of dinner as they flew to South Africa for Nelson Mandela's memorial service.

The luxury aircraft hosted a political reunion on Monday, as the two Presidents and three first ladies - Laura Bush, Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton - were on board.

The Obamas retired to the President's
 office and regular cabin at the front of the plane while former 
Secretary of State Clinton was given free reign 
of the senior staff's cabin. Bush and his wife Laura were given the 
medical suite.

The former president has been 
perfecting his painting skills since leaving office, famously producing 
colorful images of horses, dogs and still life scenes after taking 
lessons from a local artist.

And
 during the long flight to South Africa, he took the opportunity to show
 the country's leading ladies his latest work on his iPad.

He is pictured with Michelle Obama, 
Hillary Clinton, Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett, National Security 
Advisor Susan E. Rice, Attorney General Eric Holder and former First 
Lady Laura Bush.

Rice looks particularly impressed - 
gasping as he scrolls through the images - while Clinton grins and 
Holder leans over the table to get a closer look.

In the images taken by White House 
photographer Pete Souza, Obama is also pictured grinning alongside Bush 
as they board the plane for South Africa.

In
 a more serious photograph, the president is pictured editing his speech
 for the memorial with Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes.

Arrival: The Obamas, Bushes and Clinton arrive in South Africa on Tuesday for Mandela's memorial

Ahead of the journey, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the Obamas were looking forward to the political reunion.

'It's a very, I think, enjoyable experience certainly for the president and first lady,' he said. 'And they're both grateful to be able to have former president and first lady, former secretary of state on board.'

After landing, the Obamas were stuck in traffic and arrived at the memorial half an hour late - but were met with applause when they finally entered the stadium.

In his emotional tribute on Tuesday, Obama called the South African leader a 'giant of history'.

'To the people of South Africa - people of every race and walk of life - the world thanks you for sharing Nelson Mandela with us,' he said.

Solemn: President Obama talks with the First Lady with other world leaders seated nearby. He was criticized for posing for a 'selfie' with Danish leader Helle Thorning-Schmidt, pictured to his left

'His struggle was your struggle. His 
triumph was your triumph. Your dignity and hope found expression in his 
life, and your freedom, your democracy is his cherished legacy.'

He
 continued: 'Mandela taught us the power of action, but also ideas; the 
importance of reason and arguments; the need to study not only those you
 agree with, but those who you don't.'

He was also pictured sharing his condolences with Mandela's widow Graca Machel following the speech.

But the trip didn't go without its 
hitches; Obama was pictured shaking the hand of Cuban President Raul 
Castro at the service - sparking anger that he warmly greeted a 
'murderer'.

Members of Congress, including Florida 
Republican Senator and son of Cuban immigrants Marco Rubio, expressed 
their anger on Tuesday.

'If the president was going to shake 
his hand, he should have asked him about those basic freedoms Mandela 
was associated with that are denied in Cuba,' Rubio said.

Obama
 also sparked annoyance when he posed for a 'selfie' photograph with 
British Prime Minister David Cameron and Danish leader Helle 
Thorning-Schmidt.

Some viewers criticized the pose, 
calling it inappropriate behavior at an event to remember the life of 
the anti-apartheid hero, who died last week aged 95.

As the trio posed for the snap, Michelle sat alongside her husband looking somewhat stony faced.

Following
 the service, the Obamas caught up with former President Bill Clinton 
and his daughter Chelsea, as well as U2 singer Bono, before heading back
 to Air Force One.
