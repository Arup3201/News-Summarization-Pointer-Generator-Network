Tommy Seymour believes Scotland will only become a threat on the global stage once they stop being pleased just to have avoided a hammering against the big guns.

Scotland put on a brave display as they held New Zealand for large chunks of Saturday’s Test at Murrayfield before eventually losing 24-16.

They even had a chance to put themselves on the brink of victory but saw skipper Greig Laidlaw pull his penalty wide before the all-conquering All Blacks stormed downfield to score the try which put the game out of sight.

The defeat means Scotland’s 109-year wait for their first win against the world champions goes on. But there were clear signs of progress in Vern Cotter’s young side.

However, Seymour — who scored to put the hosts 7-5 up after 12 minutes — insists if the Scots are happy to just come close, they will never win. ‘We have to be pleased with the consistency levels we have shown over the last two weeks and we have to be pleased with the performance,’ he said.

‘But we have got to stop being a side that allows itself to take positives when you lose to the best team in the world, because if you do that you start drawing lines that you can’t cross.

‘We can’t keep saying we are pleased with “this much”, because if you come up against a side and your only aim is to come close, it will never be good enough.

‘We want to become a consistent threat and allow ourselves to be disappointed by the narrow margins.

‘Once you do that you can really push on.’

The Scots were 17-16 down with 13 minutes left when Laidlaw missed a kick that could have put them within touching distance of victory.

But the All Blacks came back and Jeremy Thrush found a rare gap in the home defence to score the winning try. ‘It was an opportunity for us to make history.

That doesn’t come along very often,’ said Seymour. ‘We spoke a lot about that before the game but didn’t let the occasion take over us. We wanted to go out and fight for a win that had never been done before.

‘Unfortunately we came up just shy.’

Scotland face Tonga next on Saturday, but will be without centre Mark Bennett, due to a hamstring injury. Seymour and Laidlaw are among those who require further treatment.
