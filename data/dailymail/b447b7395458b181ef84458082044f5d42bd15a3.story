Bournemouth recorded their third pre-season victory after beating Premier League side Swansea 3-1 at the Goldsands stadium.

A first-half brace from Marc Pugh and a Brett Pitmann penalty was enough for the Cherries, with Jefferson Montero's first goal for Swansea a mere consolation as their two-match unbeaten run ended.

However, it was the visitors who started the brighter and nearly took the lead on 14 minutes. Lee Lucas' free-kick from the edge of the area was palmed away by Benjamin Buchel as the score remained goalless.

On 28 minutes the deadlock was broken though, with Pugh giving the home side the lead. Simon Francis' cross found the winger who made no mistake inside the area as he headed past Gerhard Tremmel.

Spot-on: Brett Pitmann makes it 3-0 to the hosts after finishing clinically from the penalty spot

Pitmann nearly doubled the home side's advantage just nine minutes later but Tremmel got down well to palm the ball away.

Bournemouth: Buchel, Francis, Elphick, Cargill, Harte, Ritchie (Cornick 79), O’Kane, MacDonald, Pugh, Pitman, Rantie (Stockley 75). 

Swansea: Tremmel, Rangel (c) (Shephard 69), Tancock, Richards, Kingsley, King, Lucas, Sheehan (Jones 69) Montero (Bray 69), Dyer (Hanley 69), Samuel.  

Goals: Pugh 28 & 45, Pitmann 52. Montero 68

Attendance: 2,859 

They eventually did make it 2-0 on the stroke of half-time as Pugh scored his second of the game. The 27-year-old gave Tremmel no chance with his low 18-yard strike flying past the Swansea keeper as the hosts went into the interval two goals to the good.

Within minutes of the second half beginning Montero could have pulled one back for the visitors, weaving past several players down the left before his shot across goal nearly crept inside the far post.

On 52 minutes the Championship side made it 3-0 as Angel Rangel was penalised for handling inside the area as Pitmann made no mistake from the spot to put the game all but out of Swansea's reach.

On the hour mark Pitmann should have grabbed his second and his team's fourth after Francis' pinpoint cross found the former Bristol City striker, but he headed straight at Tremmel from point blank range.

Eight minutes later the Swans pulled one back with Montero scoring his first for the club. After evading a number of Bournemouth defenders his shot squeezed past Buchel via a deflection.

Both sides made changes as the game reached it's conclusion, with Eddie Howe's side picking up a valuable win against Premier League opposition ahead of their season opener away at Huddersfield next weekend.
