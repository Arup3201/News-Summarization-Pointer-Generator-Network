Their prowess on the Strictly dance floor has seen them through to this year’s final.

But as they limber up for the last time this evening to compete for the glitter ball, it seems the final four are attempting to win hearts over minds with these pictures of their younger adorable selves.

TV presenter Caroline Flack is now favourite to be crowned champion with Ladbrokes giving her odds of 8/13 and her prospects have been boosted after she impressed even the toughest judge, Craig Revel Horwood, during last weekend's semi-final to claim the first perfect 40 score of the series.

Strictly's favourite: Caroline Flack's determination to succeed should come as no surprise given the serious expression on her face as an angelic blonde-haired youngster

Her determination to succeed should come as no surprise given the serious expression on her face as an angelic blonde-haired youngster.

Speaking ahead of the final Miss Flack, 35, who is paired with Pasha Kopylova, said getting a maximum of 40 points last week was ‘the greatest moment of my life. It was my biggest achievement.

‘It has changed my life completely. I feel more confident, I have realised there are different things I want to do, I have met Pasha, he’s become a really good friend.

'It has been such a positive experience. It releases all these endorphins you never knew were there. You come out on a high every day.’

Hunky: Simon, 36, a member of the boy band Blue, is 10/1 favourite to win the final 

Saturdays star Frankie Bridge and her professional dance partner Kevin Clifton are still strong contenders to hold the trophy with odds of 9/4 and it appears Miss Bridge’s love for the dance floor was apparent as a child judging by this pose of her in a leotard and ballet shoes.

And for the mother of one who is married to footballer Wayne, the Strictly experience of fake tan, sequins and intense hours spent rehearsing has ‘been mental.

'But my friends and family are most excited about this out of anything I’ve achieved. This is the most excited and the most proud they’ve been.

'You don’t realise how many people watch it. I’ve had some of the oldest people who come up and recognise me. A couple of months ago they would never have known who I was.’

Reality TV star Mark Wright, 27, has been given odds of 14 to 1 to win - but this cute photo of him as a toddler will surely give him a boost

The two-part finale, to be screened from 6.30pm on BBC1 this evening, will see each of the finalists take to the floor more than once.

Each couple will perform a dance of the judges' choosing, and then a newly choreographed "showdance" which can blend steps from various styles.

In the second edition of the night, the fourth-placed couple will be eliminated and the remaining three will run through their own favourite dance.

The outsiders to win the show are DJ and TV presenter Mark Wright, 27, who has been given odds of 14 to 1 and Simon Webbe, 36, of boyband Blue who is 10/1 favourite - but these sweet baby snaps of the pair are sure to help them secure votes. 

Karen Hauer, who is partnered with Mark Wright, has clearly always known how to play up to the camera

Webbe, who has been put through his paces by Kristina Rihanoff, said: ‘I can’t believe that I’m here [in the final]. I’m looking around and thinking “Is someone going to wake me up in a minute?”

Wright, who has been taught to dance by Karen Hauer, said he will not be baring his chest on the dancefloor - because he is worried it is a turn-off for the audience.

He said he plans to keep it under wraps for the climax of the series after a previous flash almost led to his departure and he ended up in the dance off.

"I'm not taking mine off 'cos the last time I did it, when I undone the shirt, I was in the dance off - so no, no one likes it. I'll be buttoned up to here," he said indicating his neck.
