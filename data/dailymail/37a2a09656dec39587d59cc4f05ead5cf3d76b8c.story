A driver fiddling with his laptop who ran over and killed a young cyclist has been jailed for three years today.

Raymond Isherwood, 53, ploughed his black VW Golf into Jake Gilmore, 19, and sent him crashing onto the bonnet, the windscreen and over the roof.

Photographer Isherwood insisted he was 'completely distracted' and he didn't spot the cyclist as he was trying to eject a CD from his laptop and put it in his car music player until he felt his Volkswagen Golf hit an object.

Bristol Crown Court heard Isherwood did not attempt to brake or stop. He fled the scene and then parked his car away from his address in Royal Victoria Park, covered the smashed windscreen and dents with a plastic sheet from his boot to conceal the damage, and went home 'waiting for police to catch up with him'.

Mr Gilmore was found by passers-by lying fatally injured in the street, Midland Bridge Road. Emergency services rushed him to the Royal United Hospital, Bath, where he was pronounced dead from 'non survivable head injuries' at 4am on November 17.

Isherwood was jailed for three years after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving, failing to stop at an accident and perverting the course of justice.

Rupert Lowe, prosecuting, said: 'Jake Gilmore was cycling home from work at the Lion and Lamb pub, which was a regular 15 minute journey for him.

'Mr Isherwood then drove up behind him and drove straight into him, knocking him on the bonnet, the windscreen and the roof, before he fell into the road behind.

'Mr Isherwood knew he had hit someone but he failed to stop. He later told police he didn't even break or take his foot off the accelerator.'

Mr Gilmore, who was not wearing a helmet, was hit at 9.30pm on Saturday November 16, as he cycled home from his job as a pub chef.

Isherwood claims he was driving at around 33-34mph but did not see Mr Gilmore because he had been fiddling with a laptop to eject a CD. 

Police found the car at 9.30pm the next day and matched fragments of its grille to debris left at the scene and arrested Isherwood on November 19, having to break the door down to gain entry.

Police also found 46 cannabis plants growing in cupboards at the property.

In his police interview, Isherwood said he hoped he had hit a dog and claimed he had been distracted by attempting to move a music CD from his laptop to car player.

But forensic examination of the laptop proved Isherwood's story could not be correct and it did not have fragments of glass from the broken windscreen in it.

Charles Lowe, defending, told the court Isherwood was a man of previous good character, with a clean licence and it was his first accident in 20 years. He also admitted the production of cannabis and failure to surrender to police bail.

Sentencing Isherwood, of Bath, Somerset, to three years in prison, Judge Michael Roach, said: 'Jake was 19-years-old. He was in the prime of his life.

'He was a much-loved son and brother. The impact on his friends and family is profound.

'You have not only caused Jake's death, you have blighted, very severely, the family's life. Their suffering would have been made worse by the callous way you left the scene.'

Toby and Sue Gilmore said: 'There can be no doubt; the loss of our eldest son Jake, so suddenly and pointlessly has been the worst thing that could possible happen to us.

'His loss has inflicted emotional wounds from which we do not believe we will never recover. The space he has left can never be filled.

'Jake was less than two months short of his 20th birthday. He had only left home three months before he was killed.

'We had tried to teach him what life had to offer, and equipped him to take advantage of it.

'He was still young enough to perceive life as a great adventure, and we were looking forward to sharing it with him.

'We were advised that the sentence given to the driver is unlikely to reflect the enormous loss we now have to try and live with, but it is a relief that this process has now come to a conclusion.'
