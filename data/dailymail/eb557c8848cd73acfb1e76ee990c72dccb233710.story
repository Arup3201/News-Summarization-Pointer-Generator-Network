A thug who punched a frail 92-year-old in a row over a dog has escaped jail after a court heard that a prison term would disrupt his anger management course.

Adam Strangward, 27, was convicted of assaulting pensioner Bob Savory at a hearing last month and was told he faced prison for the attack, which left widower Mr Savory scared to leave his house, according to relatives.

But Strangward was handed a suspended sentence after a judge at Peterborough Magistrates Court heard that a custodial sentence would interrupt his progress on a nine-month anger management course.

Injured: Bob Savory was assaulted as he walked his Jack Russell Patch along the River Nene in Peterborough. He suffered a black eye and cuts to his face

Pensioner Bob Savory was assaulted as he walked his beloved Jack Russell dog Patch along the River Nene in Peterborough on July 28 last year.

Mr Savory, who uses a walking stick, claims that he was asked to keep Patch on a lead by Strangward, which resulted in the pair becoming embroiled in an argument.

The retired bricklayer, from Peterborough, suffered a black eye and cut to his face in the attack on July 28 last year.

In letters from Mr Savory’s family which were read to the court, his two daughters Pauline Morgan, 62, and Avril Beddows, 54, who sat in the public gallery, told of the effect the attack had on their father.

Adam Strangward, 27, was convicted of assault but received a suspended sentence

Mrs Beddows' statement said: 'His twilight years have been taken away from him.

'He was just getting his sense of humour back after losing mum, who died two years ago.

'After this he doesn’t go out so much.”

Mrs Morgan's note read: 'My dad is 92 and he is a true gentleman.

'All the children in the area call him Uncle Bob and they were upset by what happened.'

Speaking
after Strangward’s conviction last month, daughter Ms Morgan said that 
her father’s confidence had been shattered following the incident and 
that he no longer liked venturing outdoors.

She said: 'He was a very active, outgoing, 92-year-old man who used to walk Patch every day but he seldom does that now.

'My dad’s wife Barbara died just over two years ago and we then got dad Patch to keep him company.

'Patch
and him became very close and my dad loved walking him down by the 
river - he would do that route every day for two hours at a time.

'He still goes out and walks with Patch but these are much shorter and happen less regularly.

'My dad is a strong character and will make a full recovery but this really hit him for six.

'He didn’t deserve what happened to him.'

Strangward, who pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to one charge of assault by beating, was given a 16 week jail-term, suspended for two years.

He will also have to pay £200 in costs and £200 in compensation to his elderly victim, as well as complete 200 hours of unpaid work.

Sentencing, District judge Ken Sheraton said he acknowledged Strangward’s progress on the anger management course.

He also noted that a custodial sentence would take Strangward, who lives with his partner and their three children aged five, four and three, away from his family.

Judge Sheraton said: 'A custodial sentence is fully justified, the decision is whether that should be suspended.

'I do consider the supervision you are undertaking as having a beneficial effect.

'Any immediate sentence could have and adverse effect on you, but more importantly to the general public. It is because of that I suspend your sentence.'

The court heard that Strangward had started an Integrated Domestic Abuse Programme last year.

Julie Murtagh, defending, said: 'He is four months into a nine month programme.

'He has committed to the sessions and has attended all of his appointments.

'He is engaging with the probation service. His well-being seems more well-balanced and he is on anti-depressants.'
