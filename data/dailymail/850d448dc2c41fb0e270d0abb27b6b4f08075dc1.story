A family of extremist squatters occupying a $3million mansion in Memphis, Tennessee has been evicted by an armed SWAT team and the ringleader arrested while attempting to escape.

On Thursday night a judge signed a 
warrant for police to raid the house after a grandparent of one
of the children inside asked them to intervene.

Within five minutes a SWAT 
team had arrived in an armored vehicle full of officers 
armed with assault rifles and they quickly gained entry by smashing through the gates.

A group of squatters, pictured, broke into the $3million mansion in Memphis, Tennessee earlier this week and had refused to leave

Foreclosed: The decadent four acre residence, complete with a home theater and swimming pool, was foreclosed in August 2011 and has been sitting empty for 18 months

The squatters, claiming to be 'Moorish American 
Nationals', had consisted of Gentry and her six children, ranging in age from 11 years to 14 months.

She was caught driving 
away from the scene at 11.30pm on Thursday in a white Jaguar, which also contained a 13-year-old 
child. She was promptly arrested and charged with burglary.

The
decadent four-acre residence, complete with a home theater and swimming
pool, was foreclosed in August 2011 and had been sitting empty for 18 
months.

The squatters broke into the home on Monday and chained the gate. On Wednesday they ignored a 
bank-imposed deadline to vacate the property.

They were first discovered on 
Monday by Daniel Brown who visits the property on Shady Grove Road, a high-end neighborhood, every week to clean the pool.

Forcing entry: SWAT teams used welding equipment to gain access to the house on Thursday night

Chain: The group, who claim to be Moorish American Nationals, padlocked the gate of the $3million home

Claim: The squatters wrote a note on the gate claiming that the bank cannot own property and that the home, which was valued last year at $3.2 million, was theirs

He said he arrived to find the gate padlocked with 'no trespassing' signs posted to it.

The
squatters, who were captured laughing in the window in local TV 
footage, even wrote a note on the gate claiming that the bank couldn't own
property and that the home, which was valued last year at $3.2 million,
was theirs.

'The signage said the bank cannot own property, and that they had the original deed to the house and that they were taking them to court and there were eight other properties,' Brown told WMCTV.com.

The inhabitants, who were contacted by email, said their indigenous ancestry granted them ownership of the mansion. They added that they believe in 'love, truth, peace, freedom and justice.'

Expensive: In 2006, the residence, pictured in real estate photos, was bought for $3.9 million by Richard and April Rice

Repossessed: Renasant Bank assumed ownership in August 2011 and the home had been empty for more than a year

Power: The home still had utilities but no furniture according to neighbors

Neighbors were outraged that the squatters had bedded into their exclusive neighborhood.

'Well, I'm stunned really,' David Peck told WMCTV.com.

'I know the two former owners. And I knew the house was on the market, but I've never heard of anything like this.'

Another neighbor, Vallie Jo Bell, said: 'We were just really surprised. I hope they'll get out and maybe find another place to live.'

The home and property, totaling almost four acres, were valued at $3.2 million in 2012.

Ancestry: The inhabitants claimed in an email that their indigenous ancestry granted them ownership of the mansion

Angry: Neighbors are outraged that the squatters bedded in on their well-to-do street

The bank had ordered the illegal tenants to move out of the home by 2:30pm on Wednesday but they refused

In 2006, Richard and April Rice bought the residence for $3.9 million but Renasant Bank assumed ownership in August 2011.

The mansion still has working utilities, but neighbors said it doesn't have any furniture.

The bank had ordered the Moors to leave by 2:30p.m. on Wednesday, but they had ignored the order.
