Soaring numbers of British students are to head overseas to study as a crippling hike in tuition fees makes US universities seem an attractive prospect.

Despite American universities once being viewed as jaw-droppingly expensive, a near tripling of the cost of a degree in Britain means fee differences are now negligible.

To capitalise on opposition to rising tuition fees on this side of the Atlantic, top US universities are pushing a recruitment drive in Britain.

Heading overseas: British students see studying in the US a cheaper alternative

Rising numbers of institutions - including many belonging to the elite Ivy League - are marketing themselves to bright school-leavers.

Experts predict a year-on-year hike of the number of undergraduates and postgraduates studying in the US, from 9,000 last year to more this autumn and even more in 2013.

The number of students taking the main 
US higher education entrance exam in the UK has already soared by a 
third in the past few years.

The news comes as British universities prepare to charge up to £9,000 in annual tuition fees for the first time this term.

Figures published earlier this month showed the change has had a damaging impact on enrolment rates, with the number of students accepting places onto British universities plummeting by almost 57,000 - 12 per cent - so far this year.

J Robert Spatig, assistant 
vice-president for admissions at South Florida University in Tampa, told the Daily Telegraph newspaper this was a 'carpe diem moment for recruitment of UK students'.

He said: 'We believe that the floodgates are 
going to open once British students learn that tuition at many top 
research universities in the US may now be less than at a comparable 
Russell Group university in the UK.'

The cost of university in the US ranges from between £9,800 to £19,000 a year for an undergraduate degree.

But some institutions provide more generous scholarships and grants than those available in Britain.

A record 165 institutions, including 
Harvard, Yale, Princeton and New York University, will exhibit at the USA College Day 
fair on Friday and Saturday.

The US-UK Fulbright Commission, which 
stages the event at Kensington Town Hall, said exhibitors had soared by 
80 per cent in the last three years, with 3,500 students registering to 
attend the 2012 event so far.

Lauren Welch, director of marketing at
the Fulbright Commission, told the Daily Telegraph: 'American universities are chomping at 
the bit to reach British students. We are seeing universities of all 
shapes and sizes come over the pond this autumn, including many 
newcomers.'

And another major recruitment fair will begin in Manchester on Saturday before moving on to Leicester, Solihull, Bristol and London.

The Student World 
Fair will feature institutions from the US, Europe and Asia.

The event has reported a 25 per 
increase in exhibitors, with up to 30 institutions being represented.
