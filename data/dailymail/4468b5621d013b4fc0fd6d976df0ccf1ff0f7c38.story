With two protective arms wrapped around his little siblings, Ethan looks just like any proud older brother.

But what this photograph doesn’t reveal is that these children were all conceived at the same time – although Ethan was born a full two years before his brother and sister.

The trio arrived after their mother Katie Preston had struggled through five long years of unsuccessful IVF treatment – and started to think that she would never be able to have children.

Mrs Preston says Ethan loves helping to look after his brother and sister, and kisses them goodnight. Mrs Preston said: 'We feel truly blessed'

Katie and Matthew Preston, both 28, have 'miracle' triplets. Ethan, now two, (centre), was born in 2012, but Isabel (left) and Arthur (right), now three months old, were born two years and five days later

Mrs Preston, from Castle Vale in Birmingham, said: ‘It was heartbreaking. You end up beating yourself up, you ask yourself, why me? What did I do? What if I had done things differently?’

'I would see a woman with a pram in the street and would go home and cry,' she said.

'Many of my family and friends were having families, and we just thought it would never happen for us.

'I used to blame myself, and Matthew would blame himself - we were at rock bottom.'

The pair were referred to Midland Fertility for treatment with NHS funding in 2011.

But Mrs Preston and her husband Matthew, who are both 28, then went through a successful round of a procedure called ICSI – or intracytoplasmic sperm injection – where an embryologist chooses a sperm and injects it into an egg.

Ethan, Isabel and Arthur were made as part of six embryos created when parents underwent IVF treament. Their parents call them their 'miracle triplets'

This is different from IVF, where lots of sperm are placed inside a dish near an egg, in the hope that this will encourage fertilisation to occur.

The ICSI procedure resulted in five eggs from the same menstrual cycle being fertilised and then frozen. One was immediately inserted into Mrs Preston’s uterus.

After two weeks, she took a pregnancy test and was delighted when she saw two little blue lines appear. Nine months later she became a mother for the first time.

 But four of the eggs were still waiting for her at the Midland Fertility Clinic in Tamworth, Staffordshire.

The couple, who had always dreamed of a big family, decided to try again. 

'We just couldn't discard them after the effort and dedication that went into creating them, so we decided to use them,' Mr Preston said. 

Two of the best eggs were allowed to thaw and again injected into Mrs Preston’s uterus and by December 13, 2014 – two years and five days after Ethan, she gave birth to babies Isabel and Arthur.

She said: 'To our surprise at our first pregnancy scan, we saw not one, but two little heartbeats.'

'We think of our three children both as twins and a big brother, and as triplets.

Mrs Preston, who works as a cashier at a bookmakers, said: ‘As soon as they told me how many eggs there were – they were my children. For me, the conception starts as soon as the sperm hits the egg.

‘I couldn’t have given them to science or to another couple. For some people they are just embryos but they were my children from day one.’

Despite the age gap, Mrs Preston often dresses all three children in matching outfits, and says the trio are very alike.

Arthur and Isabel were conceived the same time as Ethan but were born two years after- in December 2014

‘Isabel never sleeps and neither does Ethan. Arthur and Ethan were also very similar as babies. Arthur is a constant giggler like Ethan,’ she said, adding: ‘I now have three beautiful children, they are all so precious and I love them all to pieces.’

Mrs Preston, a cashier at William Hill, added: 'They are our three little miracles.

'December is a busy time for the Preston family now - but we wouldn't have it any other way.

'They keep me busy, and are certainly a handful but we feel complete and adore our triplets.  

Mrs Preston is determined to help others trying for children realise that ‘their dreams can come true’. She went on to say: ‘We want to keep other people motivated, you will have your children. One day it will be you pushing that pram.’

Dr Gillian Lockwood, medical director of Midland Fertility, said the Preston family’s story should help inspire other people who are trying to have children.

She added: ‘Katie and Matthew had two pregnancies and three babies. Their story should give hope to many couples who are concerned about starting ICSI.’

The couple said they had hit 'rock bottom' before they were referred to the Midland Fertility for treatment with NHS funding in 2011 to become pregnant with Ethan

But Mrs Preston said she couldn't bear to get rid of the other embryos taken as part of the procedure called ICSI – or intracytoplasmic sperm injection – and by December 13, 2014 – two years and five days after Ethan, she gave birth to babies Isabel (right) and Arthur (left)
