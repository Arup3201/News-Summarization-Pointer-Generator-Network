A principal spent thousands of dollars of school money on baseball tickets and Broadway shows while often turning up late for work, investigators say.

Judy Hunt-Hutchings also allegedly pressured her staff at the school in the Bronx, New York, into throwing an extravagant 50th birthday party for her.

The veteran Public School 198 principal retired from her $142,000 post in June just one month after investigators learned of her alleged misconduct.

She allegedly told staff and their spouses to ‘do something big’ for her birthday and they all pitched in $65 each, reported the New York Post.

They held a party at steakhouse Frankie & Johnnie’s Pine and gave her a cash gift of $600, city investigators said.

Hunt-Hutchings allegedly spent $3,200 of school funds on 100 tickets for two New York Yankees baseball games, including 30 prime seats.

She also allegedly spent $1,200 of funds to increase parents’ involvement in schools on tickets to off-Broadway show ‘Platanos Y Collard Greens’.
