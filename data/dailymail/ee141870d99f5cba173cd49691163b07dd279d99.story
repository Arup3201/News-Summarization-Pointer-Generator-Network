Hezbollah guerrillas fought a deadly battle with Syrian rebels inside Lebanon yesterday, as the civil war inexorably takes in both countries.

Sources said at least 12 rebels were killed in the fighting east of the Bekaa Valley town of Baalbek, and that one Hezbollah fighter had also died.

It was the worst clash on Lebanese territory since the outbreak of the conflict more than two years ago.

Syria’s two-year-old conflict has increasingly sucked in its smaller neighbour, with deadly fighting shaking the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli and rockets hitting the Bekaa Valley and southern Beirut.

Shi’ite Muslim Hezbollah, which supports President Bashar al-Assad, is fighting alongside his army to drive rebels from the Syrian border town of Qusair, while Lebanese Sunni Muslim fighters have joined the anti-Assad revolt.

Tensions between Hezbollah and the Syrian rebels have risen sharply since the Lebanese militia stepped up its armed support for President al-Assad's regime last month.

The growing tensions between 
Hezbollah and rebels trying to oust al-Assad are linked to a regime 
offensive against the rebel-held town of Qusair in western Syria.

Hezbollah's involvement in the battle 
for control of the strategic town has exposed its growing role in the 
Syria conflict, prompting rebel threats to target Hezbollah's bases in 
Lebanon.

The latest fighting took place near Ain el-Jaouze in a strip of Lebanese territory which extends into Syria, the sources said, and the rebels may have been ambushed as they set up rockets to fire into Shi’ite areas of the Bekaa Valley.

Rebels have said they will carry out attacks inside Lebanon in response to Hezbollah’s support for Assad’s assault on Qusair, a strategic town for rebel weapons supplies and fighters coming into Syria from Lebanon.

The United Nations said on Saturday that up to 1,500 wounded people might be trapped inside Qusair and U.N. officials called for an immediate ceasefire to allow them to receive treatment.

The International Committee of the Red Cross asked for access, saying it was ready to enter Qusair immediately to deliver aid.

However, Syrian state television said Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem told U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon by telephone on Sunday that the Red Cross would have to wait until military operations in the area were complete.

Moualem also expressed surprise at international concern over the fighting around Qusair, saying the world had been silent when rebels took over the town 18 months ago and that Syria was now clearing it of 'terrorism', the television said.

Meanwhile, low-flying Israeli warplanes again violated Lebanese airspace, overflying the capital Beirut, the eastern Bekaa Valley and the city of Baalbek, Lebanese security officials and the state-run news agency said.

Israeli warplanes regularly enter Lebanese airspace. A security official confirmed the overflights and said they were among the most intense recently.

There was no immediate comment from Israel.

The flights come amid heightened regional tensions because of the civil war in Syria.

Israel is believed to have carried out three airstrikes inside Syria this year, said to be aimed at weapons meant for Hezbollah.

Also today, a car bomb killed at least three people in Jobar, a suburb of the Syrian capital of Damascus, said a Syrian government official.

The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a pro-opposition group, said the blast targeted a police station and killed nine Syrian soldiers. It said the al Qaida-linked group Jabhat al-Nusra carried out the attack.

Syria's state agency SANA blamed the blast on a suicide bomber, saying he blew up his explosive-packed car which was parked in the residential area. The Observatory and SANA said the explosion took place amid heavy fighting. Jobar is a scene of frequent clashes, with rebels trying to push from there toward the capital.

The army has been conducting massive sweeps through opposition strongholds around Damascus, including Jobar.
