He is the secret agent who takes his martinis shaken, not stirred.

And he would certainly be toasting the fact that his new fragrance has sold the equivalent of 1,000 full martini glasses in the first days of its launch at The Perfume Shop.

James Bond 007 for men - which should perhaps have been called Double Eau Seven - is the official scent of the Bond franchise, and has been launched to mark Bond's 50th anniversary and the release of Sam Mendes' new Bond epic, Skyfall, starring Daniel Craig.

The special Limited Gold Edition of the James Bond 007 anniversary perfume will go on sale on 1 November

Sales of the vetiver and lavender-scented cologne - which launched nationwide on 19 September after 500 limited edition bottles went on sale in Harrods in August - have exceeded all expectations in The Perfume Shop.

When it launched there last week it outsold all new men's and women's scents, and the gift 
box has already completely sold out.

The studded, rectangular bottle is equipped with a top secret swivel nozzle (designed by Q, we can only assume), and is available as a 30ml and 50ml eau de toilette natural spray, priced at £19.50 and £24.50 
respectively.

The 007 Gold Limited Edition comes in 50ml only and is priced 
at £24.50.

The Femail desk did a highly technical sniff test. Here's are the results....

'It's Abercrombie & Fitch gone a bit wrong - and it slightly reminds me of my dead granddad which quite unsettling.' BL

'It's a cheeky little snifter, isn't it? Pretty fruity. Very fruity, in fact. Fruity like shower gel. I would strongly advise against using too much.' MdL

'A powerful scent, might be better in small spritzes. Rather reminiscent of cheaper alternative Lynx, or maybe some kind of shower gel. Not how I imagined James Bond to smell but pleasant nonetheless.' FHO

'A light scent, ultimately inoffensive if used sparingly, but '007' has the potential to make your man smell like a teenage boy who's been over-zealous with the cheap shower gel if sprayed too liberally.' KW

'Isn't this Hugo Boss?' TG
