Arsenal's injury problems mounted after Kieran Gibbs, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Nacho Monreal sustained new knocks.

Manager Arsene Wenger already has a lengthy injury list, with eight players - including Jack Wilshere, Mikel Arteta, Wojciech Szczesny, Mesut Ozil and Mathieu Debuchy - missing the 1-0 win over West Bromwich.

And the win at the Hawthorns came at a cost with injuries to Gibbs (ankle), Oxlade-Chamberlain and Monreal (both knee).

The trio will be assessed by the club's medical team in the next 24 hours before a decision is made on their availability for Wednesday's Barclays Premier League clash against Southampton.

The fitness of left-backs Gibbs and Monreal will be the biggest worry for Wenger going into the clash against the high-flying Saints.

He will be hoping at least one of them proves their fitness to ensure they have a recognised left-back going in to the clash against Ronald Koeman's side.

'Gibbs and Monreal are both struggling a little bit - and Chamberlain as well,' confirmed Wenger.

'We have to see how they recover on Monday, they have knocks - but how bad it is we don't know.'

On his side's win, their first in three league games, Wenger responded to recent criticism of his side, saying: 'We can only let people talk, we live in a society of total opinion.

'But we live off what we do - not what we say.'

'We played well but we couldn't take our chances, sometimes because of the final ball, sometimes because of finishing,' Wenger added.

'After playing against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday, we finished the game looking more for solidarity because the legs were a bit jaded, but we kept it together.

'We were 1-0 up at Swansea and lost in the last ten minutes. We had a bit of luck but as well, but we had focus to defend together.'
