She might be going through a relationship rough patch but it is clear that heartache isn't affecting Kristen Stewart's sense of style

The Twilight star has become the UK's most searched for celebrity style icon - knocking Pippa Middleton off the top of the chart in the process.

Once known for grubby Converse and grungy
styling, the 22-year-old actress has adopted a more polished look over the
last 12 months, winning plaudits from the fashion world in the process 
and a lucrative perfume campaign for French label, Balenciaga.

Although Pippa topped the poll in 2011, the 2012 result shows her languishing in lowly 11th place.

Other celebrities proving a hit this year are X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos, who achieved second place and quirky American actress, Zooey Deschanel in third.

Dropping down the list are last year's runner ups, Saturday's singer Frankie Sandford and TOWIE star Sam Faiers. Faiers, who came third in 2011, dropped to ninth, while Sandford didn't make the top 10 at all this time around.

Also in the top 10 for 2012 were actress Emma Watson, model Miranda Kerr and Radio One DJ, Fearne Cotton.

Bobbie Malpass, editor of MyCelebrityFashion.co.uk - the website that produced the figures - commented: 'We had quite a few new entries this year which makes our top ten very diverse!

'We really like keeping an eye on who are the most searched for celebrity names on the website, to make sure we deliver to our readers their favourite celebrity styles and relevant content.

'This new top ten shows that people are looking for a range of styles and are taking inspiration from many different celebrities.'

She continued: 'Following the latest fashion trends can make you feel great and Kristen Stewart is certainly one to watch when it comes to her style.

'She has been all over the news lately, for all the wrong reasons, but still manages to fly the flag for fashionistas everywhere. Whatever she’s done wrong, you can’t fault the girl’s style! We will only be judging her on her sense of fashion, nothing more.'

Third: TOWIE's Sam Faiers dropped to ninth this year and was replaced in third by actress Zooey Deschanel
