Max Clifford was accused in court yesterday of being a ‘predatory’ sex offender for 20 years.

The 70-year-old millionaire pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of indecent assault against seven girls and young women aged 14 to 19. The offences are alleged to have taken place between 1966 and 1985.

The king of celebrity PR, who has represented clients including Simon Cowell and the late Big Brother contestant Jade Goody, was heckled by two protesters and mobbed by cameramen when he arrived at court in central London.

He held hands with his wife and former PA Jo Westwood as police battled to force a way through to the court entrance.

Prosecutor Deborah Carr told Westminster Magistrates’ Court that Clifford had displayed ‘a continuous pattern of sexual predatory behaviour’ over 20 years.

He looked calm in the dock as he confirmed his name, address and age in a hushed tone. The 11 charges were read to him by the court clerk and to each Clifford replied ‘not guilty’.

Outside the court, the publicist complained of being kept ‘virtually in the dark’ since his arrest last December. He said: ‘The last few months have been an absolute nightmare.’

He claimed he had only recently been supplied with the identities of his accusers, whose names were read out in court yesterday with the charges.

The earliest allegation dates back to when Clifford was a 22-year-old press officer with the music company EMI.

The first charge, relating to a 14-year-old girl, is said to have been committed on an unknown date between January 1966 and September 1967.

He is accused of further offences against three girls aged 15 to 18 between 1974 and 1979, and molesting a further three teenagers aged 16 to 19 between 1980 and 1985.

The prosecutor said three of the assault claims were ‘specimen charges’, but the ‘behaviour occurred on numerous occasions’.

She said Clifford would face five to six years’ imprisonment if he was found guilty of all the charges.

At the end of the 12-minute hearing, chief magistrate Howard Riddle said: ‘Mr Clifford, you know the allegations against you; you are sent for trial at Southwark Crown Court.’

He was released on conditional bail to appear at a preliminary hearing on June 12.

He is banned from contacting his alleged victims or having any unsupervised contact with anyone aged under 18.

He must also sleep each night at his home address.

Asked after the hearing if he was a victim of a witch hunt – a reference to a comment he made himself last month about the Jimmy Savile investigation – Clifford said: ‘That is not for me to say – you make your own mind up.

All I know is that nobody had ever said anything about me at all before the Jimmy Savile situation. This is a nightmare for myself and my family and has been since December, when I was arrested in a very, very public way, and all of my accusers remain anonymous.

‘What I have got to do now is to clear my name. These allegations are totally without foundation.’

Clifford added: ‘My lawyers have only just been told who [my accusers] are. Since December, I have been in the dark and anonymous people have made accusations from a long, long time ago.

‘I am going to prove these allegations are without foundation.’

After being charged, Clifford said: ‘I have never indecently assaulted anyone in my life.’

He was arrested in connection with Operation Yewtree, the police inquiry set up after Savile was exposed as a paedophile.

There are three strands to Yewtree – two involving Savile, and a third termed ‘Others’. Clifford falls into this third category, meaning he was not questioned in connection with Savile.
