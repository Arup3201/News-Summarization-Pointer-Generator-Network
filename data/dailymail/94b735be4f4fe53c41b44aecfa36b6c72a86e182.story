Brutalised: One-year-old Jayden Noel died of blunt force trauma to the head in January

A one-year-old was allegedly beaten to death by his mother and her boyfriend after the boy's father made frantic calls to child protection services months before begging them to protect his son.

Jayden Noel died on January 18 after repeated blunt force trauma to the head, according to the county coroner, who ruled his death a homicide.

His mother Chelsea Taylor, 20, and 29-year-old Ryan Worline were charged with 
neglect of a dependent resulting in death after being arrested on Monday in Shelbyville, Indiana.

On January 18, the couple called police to say they had woken up to find Jayden not breathing. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The boy's father Jerraco Noel, 23, from Shelbyville, had 
noticed a large bruise on his son's face when he visited him last 
August, according to the Indystar.com.

Mr Noel claimed to have contacted the State Department of Child Services to tell them that he believed his son was being abused.

He reportedly appealed to the agency to protect the boy because he had limited contact due to an ongoing custody battle with Taylor.

Mr Noel told the Star told the Star that his own father had died when he was three years old and added: 'All I ever really wanted was a father-son relationship.'

On April 9, Worline was arrested at a residence in Indianapolis while Taylor was apprehended in Shelbyville, according to Indianapolis Police Department.

Taylor and Worline, who have since ended their relationship, were expected to appear in court for an initial hearing today.

Neglect of a dependent resulting in death is a felony charge which carries a 20 to 50-year prison sentence.

Worline was being held at Marion County Jail on $50,000 bond, according to ABC. Taylor had been released after posting bail of a similar amount.

MailOnline was awaiting a response from Marion County's Department of Child Services.
