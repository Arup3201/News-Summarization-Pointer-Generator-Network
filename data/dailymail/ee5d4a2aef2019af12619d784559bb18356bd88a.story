The man behind the massive Beanie Babies craze in the mid-nineties is notoriously reclusive, but new court documents have revealed previously unknown details of his life.Ty Warner, 69, is the creator of Beanie Babies, a billionaire businessman who admitted evading taxes in a secret Swiss bank accounts.Documents filed by his lawyers in an attempt to reduce his sentence, to be handed down on January 14, serve as a fascinating biographies of one of the business world's most private personalities.

Remorseful: Warner was escorted from a Chicago courthouse after pleading guilty to tax evasion in October

Tax evasion: New details have emerged about the life of Beanie Babies creator Ty Warner in court documents filed by his lawyers

Warner was born in Chicago and had a 'challenging' upbringing in an 'unhappy family and a youth devoid of educational advantages.'

He was sent to a military school at the age of 15 and then began college at Kalamazoo College in 1962, but was forced to drop out because he couldn't afford his tuition.

He tried to enroll in the military but was deemed unfit to serve due to hearing loss.

Warner's mother was diagnosed as a paranoid-schizophrenic, and he helped take care of her, taking on a series of odd jobs to make ends meet, including busboy, bellboy, and door-to-door encyclopedia salesman.

A job as a salesman with Dakin, a company that produced stuffed toys and figurines, prompted Warner to form his own company, Ty Inc.

Craze: During the height of the Beanie Baby fad there were queues and waiting lists for the limited edition toys

He launched the Beanie Baby in the early 1990s and the company went from a small business run from his own home to a multi-billion-dollar company by the mid-1990s.

Warner designed the toy to be small enough for kids to carry around in their pockets and cheap enough that they could afford to buy them with their own pocket money. 

As the company grew, he employed business executives, but 'treated the final decision about the particular fabric or color of the company’s next Beanie Baby as a non-delegable assignment.'

The document contains summaries of letters sent by friends, acquaintances and employees of Warner in support of him, describing 'spontaneous acts of generosity,' including paying for college tuition, operations and unlimited leave for employees with sick family members.

Warner is well-known for his philanthropy, particularly to children's charities.

According to the document, Warner has paid approximately $1 billion income tax over his lifetime.

Warner's lawyers say the businessman was counseled by Swiss financial advisers to open accounts in the country for the 'safekeeping' of some of his assets.

He apparently tried to come forward to disclose his assets to the IRS but was not permitted to the IRS's disclosure program, which would have enabled him to avoid prosecution.

Pushing for a sentence of probation rather than jail time, the documents says the judge 'should keep in mind the Supreme Court’s admonition that “the punishment should fit the offender and not merely the crime.'

By the time he is due to be sentenced, his lawyers say, Warner will have complied with all terms, including paying a $53 million Foreign Bank Account Report penalty and at least $16 million in back taxes and interest.

The mystique of Beanie Babies remains today. The reclusive toymaker's creations are still going for big prices on eBay, with a 1996 Beanie Baby Peace Bear up for auction beginning at $5,000.
