The Swedish prime minister clearly has some first-day-at-work nerves as he managed to mess up his first international press conference this week.

Stefan Löfven was introducing fellow Scandinavian and Baltic leaders when he forgot their names, and was caught on camera desperately mumbling to an aide for help.

The Social Democratic leader managed to correctly introduce Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt, but when he came to Estonia's Foreign Trade Minister Anne Sulling he went silent.

It all started so well: Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven addresses his first international press conference and begins to introduce leaders form the other Scandinavian countries and the Baltic states...

... Social Democratic Party leader Löfven manages to correctly identify his Danish counterpart, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, and then it all goes wrong

Giggles on stage: Estonia's Foreign Trade Minister Anne Sulling clearly finds the funny side as Mr Löfven, in a heavy Swedish accent, blames his paperwork

Although Swedes are known for their proficiency in the English language, this was clearly not Löfven's favourite subject at school.

Realising he does not remember Sulling’s name, he starts fumbling with his notes before confessing: ’I think I've been given the wrong paperwork.’

Stuttering in a heavy accent, the newly elected former welder has to ask for help from his press secretary.

Not until he is given a new note he can return to presenting the other politicians, who can be seen giggling on stage.

Stefan Löfven, 57, was elected prime minister in September this year, but despite now being the leader of one of Europe’s most successful economies, he has never been a member of parliament, let alone been in government.

Help: After blaming 'the wrong papers', Löfven asks his press secretary Odd Guteland for help

Finally: After some theatre-whispering and a new note, Löfven can introduce the other politicians

The former welder, who has been active in the Social Democratic Party since his early teens, worked as a trade union leader before being elected party leader.

After forming a coalition with the Greens and the former communist Left Party, he won around 40 percent of the vote in elections that took place in mid-September.

The mistake by the new leader was slammed by social media users across the region after footage of the event was shown on Swedish news website Dagens Nyheter and other news sources.

The summit had been called to discuss Russia's growing military presence in the Baltic and Sweden's controversial decision to recognise Palestine as a state.

Fortunately for Löfven, after speaking with a press officer he recovered his composure and presented Sulling and the other international attendees.
