A homeless woman is facing child endangerment charges after admitting to leaving her two young children to sleep in bushes for almost a week while she had stayed in hotel rooms in Modesto, California.

Police were alerted to the situation at 11:15pm on Saturday night after getting a report of an abandoned stroller near bushes between a Wendy’s and Denny’s on McHenry Avenue.

When officers arrived they found Chardenea VanRooyen, 27, sleeping alongside her 3-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son.

VanRooyen told officers that the children had spent about five nights sleeping in the bushes with their father while she had stayed in other people’s rooms at two nearby motels.

‘She said she can’t stay there because she can’t see her children staying in the bushes,’ police spokeswoman Heather Graves told the Modesto Bee.

‘When officers asked why she doesn’t take the children with her to the hotel, she just says again she doesn’t want to see her kids sleeping in the bushes.’

Graves said officers offered to take VanRooyen and her children to a homeless shelter, but she refused.

VanRooyen also told police that she had depleted a subsidy that paid for hotels, reports the L.A. Times.

Officers found several blankets where the children had been sleeping, but described the toddlers as dirty, hungry and inadequately dressed.

‘They were very excited when officers got them food (from the nearby) Wendy’s,’ said Graves.

VanRooyen was booked on suspicion of child abandonment and neglect. She was released on Monday on a $50,000 bond.

Her children have been placed in the custody of child protective services. The boyfriend, whom VanRooyen said watched the children in her absence, hasn't been located.

VanRooyen told officers that said she had come to meet her family for dinner but the father had left.
