A price war has broken out between a town’s pound stores - which has seen one drop its prices to 90p.

Shoppers are using pound shops to supplement their weekly shop and the discount stores are lowering their prices in a bid to undercut each other and attract more customers.

The 99p Store has gradually dropped its prices from 97p to 93p and 92p - in what bosses call ‘tactical marketing’.

Poundland, who have lowered their prices and are offering goods for 90p in Torquay

Poundland, whose slogan is ‘Yes, Everything’s £1!’ is currently offering the lowest prices in Torquay, selling its products for just 90p.

A Poundland spokesman said: ‘Poundland always aims to offer great quality products for amazing value to all its customers.

‘Like all retailers we test competitor response options all the time and this is just one of a number of tactical options.

‘Poundland knows how important value is to customers and we regularly check our prices against those of our competitors to ensure we offer the best value.'

Nobody from the 99p store was available to comment.

Sonia Young, 44, a housewife from Barton, Torquay, said saving extra pennies would make her more inclined to shop.

But she said: ‘I still prefer Poundland, they’ve got more choice to start. It’s not necessarily the price, I find its better stuff they sell compared to the other one.

‘I can’t afford expensive stuff but if I see brand names it’s worth buying.'

Ray Heath, 71, from Paignton, is a volunteer at Torbay Hospital. He said: ‘If you are on a pension every penny matters, and depends how many things you buy. I run a carer group, we are all short of money.

'You go round to find the cheapest. I was brought up in the war, you did things like that, you didn’t have a lot of money.’

Scarlett Woods, 37, from Torquay, said: ‘Yes, it matters. I go in-between them, whichever is the cheapest.’
