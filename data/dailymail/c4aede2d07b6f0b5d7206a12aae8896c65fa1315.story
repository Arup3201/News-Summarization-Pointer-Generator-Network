When it comes to using your smartphone, iPad or laptop to access social media are you a hypersharer like Kim Kardashian, a tinkerer like WILL.I.AM or a  make-doer like Jennifer Aniston?

A scientist has researched how we use technology and identified six distinct categories.

His work also discovered that as well as Kim, WILL.I.AM and Jen, Blake Lively is a self-improver, Julia Roberts is a typical spectator and Katy Perry fits into the content creator category.  

Dr Jonathon Hutchinson, a lecturer at Sydney University, conducted the research in conjunction with Microsoft 'because technology is in every part of our lives'.

Black Eyed Peas singer WILLI.IAM is obsessed with technology and been dubbed a tinkerer 

The digital ethnographer started by looking at whether other social scientists had conducted research to dissect what sort of technology types humans are. 

'Scientists tend to stray away from that sort of research, it’s a difficult task, it's like trying to dissect a human,' e told Daily Mail Australia.

'I wanted to do this type of research because technology is in every part of our lifestyle, it's connecting between our work and lifestyle. 

'I am interested in why people do that. We might be looking at Facebook when we are at work or we might be at home responding to work emails.'  

The 38-year-old, who is a self confessed lover of Twitter, explained he wanted to know what technologies people are interested in, who the users are and to what capacity they used the technology.

Focus groups were set up and they interviewed two groups of 15 people- one group was aged between 22-25 who were full time students and the other set of 33-43 who were full time professionals.  

The groups were asked seven questions and they included one about if they use technology to create media.   

Actress Blake Lively is a 'self-improver' using technology to make her life more productive 

Dr Hutchinson said that 73 per cent of the younger group used technology and 22 per cent of the older group used it.

Australian scientist Dr Jonathon Hutchinson, a lecturer at Sydney University, and set out six different types of technology users 

He went on to create six different 'technology types' called the tinkerer, who is someone obsessed with technology like WILLI.IAM,.

The music star: 'I'm hands-on creative when it comes to technology collaboration.' 

A tinkerer is curious about technology and likes to take things apart to find out new solutions and shortcuts. 

The second type of person is a self improver, a person who uses technology to make life more productive.

Actress Blake Lively said: 'I find all my looks for events on this app by browsing all the runway shows. It updates quickly during Fashion Week, I truly couldn't live without this app.' 

These people are career-focussed and driven to deliver and they carry technology around, which helps them stay connected. 

The third is the hypersharer - aka Kim Kardashian - who loves to share content. 

She said: 'I take in excess of 1200 selfies of myself everyday. It ended up turning out so cool that we came up with this idea; a selfie book.' 

Kim Kardashian loves to share content and takes more than 1200 selfies a day

These people can usually be found pointing their devices at anything they find worth sharing.  

The fourth personality is the make-doer, someone  like Jennifer Aniston who doesn't care much about the newest trends. 

The Friends star said: 'I'm really computer illiterate. When I see people on their Blackberrys, working them like some girls work a hair-dryer, I'm just stunned.' 

Jennifer Aniston is a 'make-doer' branding herself 'computer illiterate' 

These people have a good personal style, they know what works for them and stick to it.  

The fifth type is the spectator who knows what is happening in the technology world but isn't fussed, like Julia Roberts. 

She said: 'Technology is like cotton candy: it looks appealing and you just can't resist getting in there.' 

These people are normally digital introverts and you might find them watching, reading, listening to talking about great stories.  

Julia Roberts is a technology 'spectator' she is most likely to be found watching, reading or listening 

The sixth and final type Dr  Hutchinson identified was the content creator, like Katy Perry. 

She said: 'I'm about sharing my life; it's not always me saying 'buy my record, buy my record!' Although I do say buy my record like once, and then I share a YouTube video of a cat.' 

These people are usually dressed with flair and are working on their next big idea. 

Singer Katy Perry is a 'content creator' and loves sharing her life 

Dr Hutchinson said: 'This is the first time that this type of research has ever been done in Australia. The quiz will be a nice way for people to see what technology type they are. 

'I would like to think that I am a will I am but I am a Katy Perry.' 

Steven Miller from Microsoft told Daily Mail Australia that there's no one size fits all approach when it comes to technology.

'We want to help people find the tech that’s right for them so they can make the most of every moment – as what we want, use and need is so personal to the individual'

The tinkerer: Technology obsessed, king of tech like WILL.I.AM

The self improver: Uses technology to make life more productive like Blake Lively  

The hypersharer: Loves to post content aka Kim Kardashian 

The make-doer: Someone who doesn't care so much about the newest and latest like Jennifer Aniston 

The spectator: Someone who knows what's happening in the technology world but isn't that fussed such as Julia Roberts 

The content creator: They love to create and share and are highly engaged in content discussion just like Katy Perry
