Felix Magath admitted his £11m signing Ross McCormack is still some way short of full match fitness after Fulham slumped to a 2-1 defeat at Ipswich on Saturday.

McCormack, who joined from Leeds at the start of July, was anonymous as Magath's side were well beaten on their return to the second tier after 13 years in the Premier League.

‘Ross came with a lack of fitness, he was not at the beginning of pre-season,’ said Magath afterwards. ‘He is not in the right shape at the moment but he will be the perfect striker for us.’

The Scotland international is likely to be consigned to the bench until he catches up, offering an opportunity for 17-year-old tyro Patrick Roberts to make a name for himself.

Fulham were at their most dangerous at Portman Road after Roberts was introduced from the bench with 20 minutes to play and he is sure to feature prominently this season.

But who is this teenage talent? Here's our lowdown.

Talent: Patrick Roberts made a superb cameo appearance during Fulham's 2-1 defeat against Ipswich 

Why all the fuss?

Quite simply, Roberts catches the eye with every performance, whether it be for Fulham's first team, their youth team or England Under 17s.

Stationed on the right against Ipswich, for example, he tested their back line again and again with his speed, skill and confidence to take on defenders.

Entering the game when Fulham were two goals down, he added much-needed energy and impetus and they very nearly snatched a point from the game.

Where does he play?

Roberts can either play wide on the right, where he regularly cuts inside the left-back to shoot at goal or cross, or behind an out-and-out forward.

He is adept at finding pockets of space around the box and troubles central defenders with his direct runs at them.

Leading man: Roberts inspired the Fulham Under 18s to the FA Youth Cup final last season

What’s his background?

Roberts hails from Kingston-upon-Thames and joined Fulham’s academy at the age of 13. From the Under 14s, he quickly advanced through the ranks and was soon a regular in the Under 18s.

In 2012-2013, he scored nine goals in 24 appearances at this standard and last season he got 14 in 27.

Roberts has just enjoyed a phenomenal breakthrough season. He inspired Fulham to the final of the FA Youth Cup, the furthest the club have ever progressed in the competition.

The teenager scored a hat-trick against Tottenham in the fourth round, a vital equaliser at Reading in the semi-final and a memorable goal in the second leg of the final with Chelsea.

It took a miraculous comeback, in which Chelsea scored three times in the final 13 minutes, to beat Fulham 7-6 on aggregate and deny Roberts a winners’ medal.

After just a handful of Under 21 appearances, Roberts was fast-tracked to the first team and was named in the squad for the match with Newcastle on March 15 before coming off the bench to make his debut at Manchester City a week later.

Magath describes him as an ‘incredible talent’ and clearly felt he was ready for top flight football. With wholesale changes at the Cottage over the summer, more first-team opportunities await in the second tier. 

The young winger has scored six goals in 11 matches for the Under 17s

What about international honours?

Roberts made his England Under 16 debut in September 2012 and has been a regular ever since. He has scored six goals in 11 matches for the Under 17s and won a European Championship winners’ medal back in May.

At the finals in Malta, he scored a hat-trick against Turkey in the group stage and a brilliant individual goal against Portugal in the semi-final, before playing a full part in the final against Holland.

What are his strengths?

Aside from the aforementioned speed and trickery to take on defenders, Roberts has a good eye for goal, a neat first touch and excellent control with the ball at his feet.

Weaknesses?

Roberts may have to bulk up a little to cope with the physical challenge of playing at the top level, but that will come as he gets older.

What happens now?

Roberts signed a contract shortly after his 17th birthday that ties him to Fulham until 2016 but as his profile grows, there is bound to be interest from Premier League clubs.

He has been earmarked as one of the brightest English talents of his generation and hopefully he will continue to progress and achieve his potential.
