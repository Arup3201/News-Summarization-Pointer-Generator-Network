Manuel Pellegrini has set Manchester City a target of 87 points to retain their Premier League crown.

The champions trail Chelsea by three points going into the trip to West Bromwich but are on course to meet Pellegrini’s mark as they approach the halfway point of the season.

Twice in the past three years, City have won the title on the final day after finishing level with Manchester United on 89 points and edging out Liverpool with 86.

Pellegrini estimates that this year’s winning total will be somewhere between the two.

‘You must win around 86 or 87 points,’ he said. ‘You have to play for 57 points in the second half of the season and there are still six points in this half, so that’s 63 points. With big teams it’s always important to win titles but we are not thinking about what we did last season, or what happened with Chelsea.

‘You must always forget whatever we did in the past and try to have your mind in the present because every season is different.’

Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic has claimed the leaders are capable of winning a quadruple this season under Mourinho, but Pellegrini speaks from experience when he says that such a feat would be very difficult.

City won a Premier League and Capital One Cup double last season, and were in contention for four trophies until March, when they went out of the FA Cup and Champions League in the space of four days.

But Pellegrini added the Premier League crown to the Capital One Cup to cap a memorable first season

‘It’s difficult, especially during December and January,’ said the City boss. ‘They are two months when you have to play nine games each month, like we did last year.

‘You get towards the end of the season, March and April, but you must play semi-finals, finals of the cups. You must be on top of the table too, and you play fewer league games because of the cups.

‘We tried last year and we couldn’t do it for different reasons. It’s always possible — difficult but possible.’ 

Pellegrini confirmed that Yaya Toure is expected to leave for the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast after the FA Cup tie against Sheffield Wednesday a week on Sunday and could be unavailable until well into February.

That has placed even greater importance on keeping Frank Lampard at the Etihad, with the former England midfielder’s future still unresolved.

City are confident that Lampard’s loan from their US sister club New York City will be extended until at least mid-February and possibly for the rest of the season.

It is understood that the timing of the announcement is particularly sensitive, with New York preparing for their debut season in Major League Soccer and Lampard a central figure in their plans both on and off the pitch. ‘It’s an internal reason that’s not important,’ said Pellegrini. ‘The important thing is that Frank Lampard stays here. Yes, I’m confident he’ll stay but I can’t say 100 per cent because it doesn’t depend just on me.

‘It’s not so easy because Frank is a New York City player. He’s only on loan until December so we must respect the other people.

‘One of the reasons we asked Frank to play here was because we knew Yaya would be leaving us to go to the Africa Cup of Nations.

‘Yaya will go around January 5-10. We are not exactly sure of the dates but I think maybe the FA Cup game will be the last one. You always want to retain the best players here but you know the rules.’
