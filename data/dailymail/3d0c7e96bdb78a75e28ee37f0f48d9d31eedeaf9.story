A 400-foot section of a bridge in Wisconsin has been closed after a motorist noticed the bridge was beginning to sag.

The Leo Frigo Bridge suddenly began to dip forcing police to close off the span that carries Interstate 43 over the Fox River some 120 feet below.

‘There's a part that's sagging,’ a driver told a 911 operator.

‘A part that's sagging?’ the operator asked.

‘Instead of a bump, it's a dip,’ the driver said.

Sagging: Authorities say a section of the Interstate 43 bridge, about 150 to 200 yards long, dipped about three feet across all four lanes. No one has been injured. Police closed the bridge, known as the Leo Frigo Memorial Bridge, before sunrise Wednesday

It appears the dip was caused by one of the pillars that holds up the bridge which sank around two feet into the ground.

The bridge, which carries 40,000 cars a day, will be closed indefinitely.

 ‘We understand the disruption this is going to cause to traffic,’ said Wisconsin Transportation Secretary Mark Gottlieb.

As straight as an arrow: Here's how it normally looks... without any kinks

The bridge was built in 1980 and last inspected in August 2012 when it was declared sound and renovated shortly thereafter.

The closure created traffic chaos in Green Bay.

Cause: The likely culprit is the settling of Pier 22, a support pillar that is on the east approach to the bridge. The pier settled a little over two feet, and the state DOT will continue taking periodic measurements to see if it's continuing to move

 ‘It's a big hassle, because of all the construction that's going around town,’ said Dennis Kelln of Green Bay. ‘The downtown bridge was closed for how long? Now this one is out? It's just like it's a never-ending problem here.’

Governor Scott Walker spoke on the closure Wednesday afternoon during a press conference.

'It's a key transportation link in the area,' Walker said. 'Our #1 priority is and will continue to be ensuring the absolute safety of the public.'

The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has set up detours in the meantime.

The DOT doesn't have a timeline or a price tag on fixing the bridge just yet.

Governor Walker promised repairs will happen, whatever the cost.

'Once we know the full details of what's required to fix this bridge, we will fix this bridge,' the governor said, 'because it's not only important to Brown County, it's also important to the State of Wisconsin.'

Governor Walker said the Interstate-43 bridge over the Fox River is 'vitally important' to commerce in Northeast Wisconsin and Michigan but that the safety of people who would be on or around the bridge will be the primary factor in determining how long the bridge will be closed.

'Once we know the full details of what's required to fix this bridge, we will fix this bridge,' Governor Walker said, 'because it's not only important to Brown County, it's also important to the State of Wisconsin'

Diversions in place: The bridge, formerly known as the Tower Drive bridge, will remain closed indefinitely as inspections continue

State officials say the bridge is in no danger of collapsing like the Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River in Mount Vernon, Washington, this spring.

In that incident, a tractor-trailer struck a support on the bridge, which had been rated ‘functionally obsolete,’ sending several cars plunging into the river below. No one died, but three people were taken to the hospital for treatment

The Wisconsin bridge is named after Leo Frigo, who ran Frigo Cheese Corp. until his retirement in 1983.

A former member of Roman Catholic religious orders, he was well-known in the area for his work with ex-convicts and for founding a Green Bay food pantry, according to his official biography on the pantry's website. He died in 2001.
