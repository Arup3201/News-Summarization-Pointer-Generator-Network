USA Cycling says Lance Armstrong can't ride in a South Carolina event this weekend with several of his former U.S. Postal Service teammates.

Armstrong had hoped to ride with George Hincapie and several other former teammates at the non-competitive ride that bears Hincapie's name. 

But because the ride is still authorized by USA Cycling, Armstrong can't participate under his lifetime ban for using performance-enhancing drugs.

Armstrong declined comment Thursday.

Hincapie was among Armstrong's closest friends on the Postal Service team. But he also was one of the key witnesses against Armstrong in the 2012 report by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency that exposed Armstrong's doping.

Armstrong is facing a federal whistle-blower lawsuit by former teammate Floyd Landis that could bring penalties approaching $100 million.
