British ISIS captive John Cantlie  appears to have written an article for the latest copy of the terror group's propaganda magazine.

The piece, entitled 'Meltdown', appears at the end of the sixth issue of Dabiq magazine and praises the Islamic State's decision to start minting its own currency.

Mr Cantlie's name appears alongside the story, though it is not clear what role he had in writing it, or whether his byline was added to another person's work.

The 'special report' appears at the end of the sixth issue  of the magazine, and describes how the US dollar will collapse, before speaking about the benefits of using gold as currency.

The piece then goes on to praise the Islamic State's decision to start minting its own coins in Iraq and Syria as 'a smart move'.

According to the article the terror group is planning to use gold dinars and silver dirhams for trade, an ancient form of currency which stretches back to the time of Mohammed.

Dabiq is part of the Islamic State's slick propaganda machine, which includes producing HD videos of battle scenes, hijacking social media accounts to recruit online, and making a specially designed smartphone app.

Named after a town in Syria where ISIS believes a final showdown between Muslim and Western forced will occur, it praises the terror group's decisions and explains their ideology. 

The group claims that issuing money based on gold will mean that it does not lose its value, and will end their reliance on the price of oil for economic stability. 

Mr Cantlie was captured by Islamic State fighters in November 2012, along with US journalist James Foley, who has since been beheaded in a gruesome video posted online.

Meanwhile Mr Cantlie has been forced him to take part in seven ISIS propaganda videos, recorded in the style of a news report in which he praises the terror group and criticises the West.

Mr Cantlie was captured in 2012 and has since become part of Islamic State's propaganda machine, appearing in heavily scripted videos. It is not clear what, if any, role he had in writing the latest article

He usually appears dressed in an orange Guantanamo-style prison jumpsuit, sitting behind a desk against a black background while reading in forced tones from a script.

However for the last video he appeared standing outside on the streets of Kobani, where ISIS are engaged in a bloody and prolonged battle with Kurdish forces.

In a previous video Mr Cantlie has discussed attempts by the US to rescue him, and how he was moved to another camp just days before the raid. 

His family have repeatedly appealed for his captors to make direct contact with them so they can discuss his release, but in one video MR Cantlie said he has accepted that he will be beheaded.

His father Paul, 80, sent a direct message to ISIS from his hospital bed begging the terrorists to send his son home before he passed away. He died a short time afterwards.
