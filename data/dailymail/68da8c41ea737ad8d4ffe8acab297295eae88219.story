Jeremy Hunt says hundreds of thousands of sufferers are condemned to a life of fear and anxiety because they are receiving no help

More than half of those with dementia are not receiving medicine or support from the NHS, the Health Secretary reveals today.

Jeremy Hunt says hundreds of thousands of sufferers are condemned to a life of fear and anxiety because they are receiving no help.

Stigma is a ‘huge part of the problem’, with patients terrified to seek a diagnosis and too many GPs thinking there is no point in doing so.

The fight against diseases such as Alzheimer’s is as ‘significant as that against cancer, heart disease and HIV’, Mr Hunt will say, as it is revealed the national diagnosis rate for dementia is only 48 per cent.

In addition, an unforgivable postcode lottery means people living in neighbouring cities have hugely varying chances of being diagnosed, with 75 per cent of cases in the best area being diagnosed – compared with 33 per cent in the worst.

It means hundreds of thousands of people are living without medication to stave off their condition and their families are not receiving help from the State.

It appears that a distinct North/South divide on dementia exists – with diagnosis rates in the South and East of the country much lower than in the North and West.

The failings mean many people are being forced into expensive residential care much earlier than necessary, when they could live happily in their homes for much longer if they had been diagnosed.

On the eve of the launch of the first-ever national survey of dementia diagnosis, Mr Hunt said: ‘In too many parts of the country, people think that there is no point in getting it diagnosed because they think nothing is going to happen.

‘And sadly, in some parts of the country that is true. We need to ensure that when someone is diagnosed, the system swings into action and gets people the support they need.

'There is a demographic time bomb but we are not giving people the care we should be giving them.’

Of all the conditions that occur in later life, dementia is the most feared.

A poll found that 39 per cent of 55-year-olds fear getting Alzheimer’s above any other disease, including cancer.

Mr Hunt said there is a lot GPs can do these days including medicines to stave off the condition

About 670,000 people in England live under the shadow of dementia, and experts expect this number to double over the next 30 years.

Mr Hunt said Britain had a moral responsibility to fight dementia.

‘There are still some GPs who think there is no point giving someone a dementia diagnosis, and in the past they would have had a point.

'But now there is a lot they can do – medicines to stave off the condition, support for families.

'We need to get the message out that things are changing.

‘In the 60s, people were terrified of cancer and people were terrified of talking about it.

'In the 80s, it was Aids. Unless we start talking about dementia, we will not be able to improve the situation.’ 

The Health Secretary spoke ahead of the publication of a report showing how well dementia services fare across the country.

It looks at how many sufferers would be expected in an area based on the local demographic profile, and what proportion have diagnoses.

The best performing area is Corby in Northamptonshire on 75 per cent, followed by South Tyneside on 71 per cent.

At the other end of the scale are Herefordshire and Harrow, North-West London, both on 33 per cent.

It shows that diagnosis rates vary wildly between neighbouring areas.

Birmingham Central has a diagnosis rate of 64 per cent, while nearby Walsall is on 37 per cent.

The North London borough of Islington has a diagnosis rate of 64 per cent, compared with 33 per cent in nearby Harrow. 

Last night Liz Kendall, Labour’s spokesman for older people, said: ‘If David Cameron was serious about improving the quality of dementia care, he would not have cut council budgets for older people’s social care to the bone.’
