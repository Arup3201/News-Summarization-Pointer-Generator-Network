Kanye West rubbed shoulders with New York political royalty today as he joined Chirlane McCray and Huma Abedin on the front row at Ralph Lauren.

The rapper-turned-fashion designer was seated in prime position next to Ralph's wife Ricky dressed in RRL camouflage cargo pants and a hooded flight jacket.

But while Kanye is a New York Fashion Week regular, it was a first appearance  for Kanye's fellow front-rowers - Mayor Bill de Blasio's political speechwriter wife Chirlane and Hillary Clinton aide Huma (who is married to former Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner) - who rarely attend such events.

Guest of honor: Kanye West sat front row at Ralph Lauren's New York Fashion Week show today

Bonding: In a backstage photo taken before the show by Ralph's younger son David, the designer is seen affectionately touching Kanye's cheek

They were joined by other members of the Lauren family, eldest son Andrew, daughter Dylan and David's wife Lauren Bush Lauren.

Prior to the event, Kanye was seen bonding with the family. In a photo shared by Ralph's son David, the designer, 75, is seen affectionately touching Kanye's cheek.

The show, which traditionally takes place on the final morning of New York Fashion Week, had a luxurious ranch theme, with creamy tasseled knits and shearling coats.

Models, the usual Ralph Lauren all-American beauties, were accessorized with cowhide bags and oversized hats that Pharrell will no doubt be coveting. 

Fashion expert and host of TLC's Style By Jury, Louise Roe, who attended the show, told Daily Mail Online: 'This was my favorite Ralph Lauren collection ever. The warm taupes, rich lace and suede textures, ladylike silhouettes, just gorgeous! 

'There was one wide brim hat and a boot with a cool tortoiseshell heel that I've got my eye on!' 

Mr Lauren was greeted by a standing ovation when he took his bow, and as always, made sure to give wife Ricky a kiss when he walked by her seat.

"Ralph is the god," Kanye West claimed recently, ceding his self-proclaimed holy title to the famed designer.

And we do have to admire Ralph Lauren's ability to sell not just clothing, but  the American dream.

Lauren's latest collection relied on his minimal, straight forward tailoring and Fall 2015 threw in a bit of extra Navajo flair with detailing such as beading and fringe.

Our favorite part of the show was this sweeping shearling number, which unfortunately won't be available until fall... and just thinking about it's accompanying price tag makes us cringe.
