A mother who underwent a hysterectomy was horrified after her stitches burst open within an hour of returning home - leaving her with a gaping nine-inch wound.

Clair Bartlett, 34, faced hours of agony waiting nearly two hours for an ambulance to arrive, and a further four to be seen in A&E.

The disabled mother-of-four was left in agonising pain, holding her open wound.

In desperation her husband, Jason, was forced to tape her bleeding and oozing injury together.

The 34-year-old was forced to wait an hour-and-a-half for an ambulance to reach her Basingstoke home on July 26, and her family claim they waited a further four hours to see a doctor after arriving at hospital. Mr Bartlett said he resorted to using medical tape to try and close his wife's wound as they waited for help

He told MailOnline: 'Clair had just got back from hospital and was in the bathroom.

'Our eldest daughter Shannon, 13, came into talk to her and said "mum, do you know your wound is bleeding?"

'Clair called me in and as she did, it literally burst open like a zipper.

'Shannon freaked out and that made all the other children run in the bathroom - they have all seen it and are traumatised now.'

Mr Bartlett dialled 999 just before 5.30pm on Saturday, July 26, and was told by the operator to clamp his wife's stomach together until help arrived.

'Clair was literally sitting there, holding the wound together with her bare hands,' he said.

'We were later told there must have been an infection in the wound which is why it hadn't healed.'

The 41-year-old taped the wound but the ambulance did not arrive at the couple's Basingstoke home until 7.06pm - an hour-and-a-half later.

During that time, the family rang 999 for an hour and were reassured that despite it was a busy Saturday evening, help was on its way.

'I was asked "can you see the intestines?" I said "I don't know - I'm not a doctor, all I can see is lots of red tissue",' he told MailOnline.

'I was told, rest assured, help was on its way.'

Mr Bartlett said: 'Clair was literally sitting there, holding the wound together with her bare hands... I wanted to drive Clair to hospital myself, but she was worried about being moved with the wound split open.' Mr Bartlett claims he was told their call was classified as non-urgent by ambulance operators

Mr Bartlett was also told to take his wife to lie down, because she had started to feel sick and dizzy due to the searing pain in her abdomen.

Mrs Bartlett underwent the hysterectomy on July 16.

'The surgeons seemed happy afterwards,' said her husband.

But the couple were 
unhappy that Mrs Bartlett - who takes 51 different pills every day for 
her various conditions - was not allowed to self administer them in 
hospital.

She discharged herself on the Friday, a day earlier than advised by doctors, and returned to have the stitches out on the Saturday.

An hour after getting home, her stomach burst open.

Her husband recalled: 'We got 
home about 4pm and an hour later, Clair went to the loo before she went 
to bed. It was then that everything happened.

In
 statement, South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SCAS),
 told MailOnline: 'I can confirm that we were called at 17:30 on 26 July
 to an address in Basingstoke to a 999 call.

'We are now reviewing the call and are therefore not able to comment further until thereview has been completed.

'We are already in contact with the patient and their family and it is regrettable that on thisoccasion we didn’t arrive at the patients side until 19:06.

'We take our response to our patients very seriously and we would like to take theopportunity to wish the patient a speedy recovery.'

A
 spokeswoman for Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'All 
issues and concerns raised by patients, families and visitors very 
seriously and all complaints are seen and responded to by our Chief 
Executive.

'We
 have met with Ms Bartlett and/or her partner on a number of occasions 
to listen to their concerns and explain the care and treatment given.

'We have also apologised for the communication problems they experienced.'

'In the end, I ended up trying to
 hold the wound together with medical tape -the white stretchy stuff you
 might put over a plaster.'

After three calls to the ambulance service, Mr Bartlett said he was becoming infuritated.

'I wanted to drive Clair to 
hospital myself, but she and my father-in-law were worried about moving 
her with the wound split open,' he said.

'They basically convinced me 
otherwise,' he told MailOnline.

'When the ambulance driver turned up, he seemed bemused that I was so angry. He said he only got the call 13 minutes before.'

Mr Bartlett claims the call had 
been marked as non-urgent by the Ambulance Service.

'How can a call be 
non-urgent when they asked me if I could see my wife's intestines?,' he 
said. 

'There were no sirens, nothing, when they turned up. One 
of the paramedics said they were "disgusted" at the fact they had only 
just got the call. What if she had deteriorated? We could have lost 
her.'

He added: 'Looking back, they
 did have to dig really hard to get the stitches out - and yanked them 
out - I'm not sure if that contributed.'

He said that because Mrs Bartlett, who relies on a wheelchair and crutches, is
 physically disabled, the surgeons agreed to remove all the stitches in 
one go rather than two stages, as they do normally. 

'We trusted the doctors and throught it would save to-ing and fro-ing,' Mr Bartlett said.

He said the stitches that burst, were the external ones, not the internal ones holding her stomach together.

When Mrs Bartlett was admitted to Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital the family said it was was another four hours before they were seen by a doctor.

The wound was bandaged with a special plaster and doctors prescribed antibiotics, but told the family the wound could not be sewn up because Mrs Bartlett was suffering an infection.

Three weeks on from her ordeal, and Mrs Bartlett, who is disabled due to fibromyalgia, a condition which causes pain all over the body, restless leg syndrome and Raynaud's disease, is finally healing.

But Mr Bartlett is furious at the 'unnecesary pain and trauma' his wife has been through.

'We don't blame the hospital - we just don't understand why the ambulance took so long and then why it took so long for Clair to be seen in hospital,' he said.

The couple are now considering legal action.
