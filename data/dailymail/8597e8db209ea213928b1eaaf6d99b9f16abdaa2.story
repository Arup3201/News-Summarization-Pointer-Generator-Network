After loaning Rangers £2million this week, Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has increased his control over the crisis-hit club.

But how far does that control extend? What practical effects will it have? And are fans right to be worried?

Sportsmail's John McGarry answers the key questions on Ashley's latest power grab. 

Does Mike Ashley now own Rangers outright?

In a word – no. However, to all intents and purposes, he is now the powerbase at the club. Rangers will now take whichever direction he decides.

But isn’t his shareholding still fairly minimal?

Yes. He only owns 8.92 per cent of the club but it’s the terms of the £2m loan he agreed to give Rangers last week that cements his position. 

It’s believed Ashley will have two placemen on the board and he is already allies with James Easdale, chairman David Somers and Normal Crighton. So he’ll be calling all the shots.

And who are his men on the board likely to be?

Former Newcastle chief executive Derek Llambias is already in Glasgow and seems certain to fill the chair vacated by outgoing CE Graham Wallace this week. 

Another Ashley man, Stephen Mucklow, is likely to fill the void left by finance chief Philip Nash. The removals of both Wallace and Nash were a condition of the Ashley loan.

As the owner of Newcastle too, isn’t there a conflict of interest there?

You would have to say, potentially, yes. That’s why, when Ashley initially bought a smaller stake in the club last year, the SFA struck a deal with him not to own more than 10 per cent or have ‘boardroom influence’ in the future – mirroring UEFA’s stance on such matters.

The governing body has written to Ashley for clarification but it seems highly unlikely they’ll call him out on it. His £2m loan saved the club from going into administration, after all.

But what of the potential for Rangers and Newcastle to meet in European competition in the future?

Both clubs and UEFA will cross that bridge when they come to it. But bear in mind that Ashley wants out of Newcastle by 2016. That’s the earliest date when Rangers could potentially be back in European competition, so it might never come to it.

Did the club have an alternative to Ashley’s proposal?

They had two. Former Rangers director Dave King headed a consortium willing to invest an initial £16m in the club. Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy was also in the frame with a finance package. In the end, the board sided with Ashley.

How has this gone down with the fans?

Most were in favour of King and they now appear to be split down the middle. Some can see no further than a man with a net worth of £3.75 billion and feel this can only be a good thing. 

Newcastle have turned a profit the past few years, for example. Other are suspicious of the sportswear tycoon’s motives.

As well as a lucrative merchandising deal – Ashley already takes a 49 per cent cut – he also has naming rights for the stadium which he picked up for £1 from Charles Green. So far he hasn’t activated this. 

If copyright on the club badge now belongs to Ashley, fans fear his company - as opposed to Rangers – only stands to profit.

What about Ally McCoist?

Despite suggestions he was under immediate threat, the Rangers boss has been told his job is safe. But like everyone else at the club, he is now working under a cloud of uncertainty. Time will tell.

Rangers manager Ally McCoist has been assured of his position but everyone at the club will be uncertain
