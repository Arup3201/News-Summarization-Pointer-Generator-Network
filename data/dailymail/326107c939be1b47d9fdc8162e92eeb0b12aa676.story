Washington state became the seventh in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage, even as opponents of the measure signed by Governor Christine Gregoire Monday vowed to prevent the law from ever taking effect.

The measure, which won approval from state lawmakers last Wednesday, remains essentially on hold for a standard 90 day waiting period, meaning gay couples can't begin to walk down the aisle in the northwest state just yet.

Opponents of the statute have promised to seek its repeal through a ballot measure at the polls in November that could delay enactment further or halt it entirely. The issue is also likely to figure in the state's Republican presidential politics.

Still, the bill-signing marked another key victory for gay rights advocates after a federal appeals court declared a voter-approved gay marriage ban in California unconstitutional last week, and the New Jersey state Senate approved a same-sex marriage bill earlier on Monday.

Gregoire, a Democrat and a Catholic, signed Washington's measure to raucous applause during a ceremony in the ornate reception room of the Olympia statehouse.

'This is a very proud moment... I'm proud of who and what we are as a state,' she declared.

Several dozen protesters, including members of the group Knights of Columbus, stood silently in the Capitol Rotunda overlooking the reception hall holding signs with slogans declaring that marriage is meant to be 'one man, one woman.'

Republican White House candidate Rick Santorum, a staunch conservative and outspoken foe of same-sex marriage, was making two stops in Washington state on Monday to galvanize support for the Republican caucuses there on March 3.

He was to meet with Republican lawmakers in Olympia in the afternoon, then give a speech in Tacoma on Monday night.

Anticipating the repeal campaign that lies ahead later this year, the governor added, 'I ask all Washingtonians to look into your hearts and ask yourselves -- isn't it time? ... We in this state stand proud for equality.'

Democrats, who control both legislative bodies in Olympia, accounted for

In 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage in the United States as a result of a ruling by the state Supreme Court.

Connecticut was the second state to make gay marriages legal after a state Supreme Court ruling in 2008.

The Iowa Supreme Court overturned a ban on same sex marriages April 3, 2009, making them legal there.

Vermont became the first state to make gay marriage legal with a legislative vote after lawmakers overrode the governor's veto April 7, 2009.

In New Hampshire, lawmakers approved a same-sex marriage bill and it was signed by the governor June 3, 2009.

On December 15, 2009, the Washington DC city council voted to allow gay marriage.Â 

New York became the most recent state to legalize gay marriage after a vote of the legislature in 2011.

the lion's share of support for the 
measure. The stage for swift passage of the measure this year was set 
after Gregoire, who is in her last term of office, said last month she 
would endorse such a law.

Several prominent Washington-based companies employing tens of thousands of workers in the state have supported the bill, including Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks.

Opponents were led by Roman Catholic bishops and other religious conservatives.

Gay marriage efforts elsewhere

Supporters of same-sex marriage are pushing similar statutes in Maryland and New Jersey, whose Democratic-controlled state Senate in Trenton approved a gay marriage bill earlier on Monday. Republican Governor Chris Christie has vowed to veto it if it reaches his desk.

A referendum to legalize gay marriage in Maine has qualified for the November ballot there. Six other states already recognize gay marriage -- New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire and Iowa -- as does the District of Columbia.

Two of Washington state's leading proponents of gay marriage, state Representative Jamie Pedersen and state Senator Ed Murray, hailed the work of Olympia's legislature.

'Years from now, our kids will look back and wonder what all the fuss was about,' said Pedersen, who has four young children with his partner of 10 years.

Murray, who has said he will marry his companion of nearly 20 years, added, 'My friends, welcome to the other side of the rainbow.'

In the meantime, opponents of same-sex matrimony have said they would seek to overturn the legislation via one of two ballot measures -- a referendum for repeal or an initiative defining marriage as the exclusive domain of heterosexual couples.

If a repeal referendum qualifies for the November ballot, the gay marriage law would be suspended until the certification of election returns in December, before it is either repealed or goes into effect.

But qualification of a proposed initiative defining matrimony as restricted to one man and one woman would not, in and of itself, prevent gay marriages from proceeding under the newly passed statute starting on June 7.

It remains unclear whether gay weddings performed in the interim would be nullified if an initiative were to pass in November.
