Police are blasting five people a day with 50,000-volt Taser guns as use of the controversial weapons has soared.

New figures show the stun-guns – which deliver a powerful electric shock to incapacitate the target – were drawn, aimed or fired a record number of times in the last year.

Home Office data showed Tasers were used 10,488 times in the 12 months to the end of June – a 13 per cent increase compared with the 9,289 on the previous year.

Over that period, police zapped 1693 people with Tasers – equivalent to shooting five people every day.

A detailed breakdown shows that between January and June this year, 826 people were shot with the supposedly non-lethal weapons.

Police used Tasers on 5,107 occasions over the six-month span. This was up one-third – 32 per cent – on the same period in 2012 and use has quadrupled since they were initially deployed 1,267 times in the first half of 2009.

Senior officers insist Tasers are used as a weapon of last resort, when there is such a severe threat of violence that force is needed to protect the public, police or a culprit.

But critics have accused the police of using them as a ‘compliance tool’ – and claim this is proved by the relentless rise in their use.

Concern is mounting that ten people have died after being Tasered since the controversial guns were introduced a decade ago.

Last week the Mail told how five police officers involved in an incident in which an innocent man was shot dead with a Taser have demanded their identities are kept secret at his inquest.

Ice cream factory worker Jordan Begley, 23, from Gorton, Manchester, had a suspected heart attack after being hit with the stun gun outside his terraced house after a disturbance with his neighbours in July last year.

In March, a policeman was ordered to apologise to a blind man after he shot him with a Taser in Chorley, Lancashire, in 2012. The officer said he thought the victim’s white stick was a samurai sword.

And the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating the use of the stun guns on three boys with severe learning difficulties, aged 14 and 15, after reports of a violent incident at a school near Plymouth last year.

The IPCC has admitted it has ‘serious reservations’ about when officers are using the weapons. Complaints from the public have soared amid suspicion the police are often using Tasers without proper justification.

A Taser is recorded as ‘used’ when an officer draws it from its holster. In the first six months of the year, Tasers were used in their ‘red dot’ mode –when a laser beam illuminated a target – on 2,636 occasions, or 52 per cent.

Tasers were also used to stun a target – like an electric cattle prod – on 123 occasions in England and Wales.

Oliver Sprague, of Amnesty International UK, said: ‘What these figures don’t tell you is when and why police officers have drawn these highly dangerous electro-shock weapons more than 10,000 times in the past 12 months.

‘We’re not against Tasers if used by specially-trained police officers trying to prevent a death or a serious injury, but we simply don’t know the circumstances in which people are being fired at with these potentially lethal weapons.’

But Commander Neil Basu, the Taser spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: ‘Officers who are selected to carry Taser have a proven track record of policing.

‘Taser is not a panacea to all occasions when police officers need to use force and will only be used in situations where officers face violence or the threat of violence.

Tasers were introduced to give officers an option between firearms and other weapons such as batons and CS gas.

They have been discharged in more than 6,200 confrontations across England and Wales since they were introduced in 2004.

Police use a U.S. manufactured £500 X26 model which fires a 50,000-volt charge into the victim via two barbs attached to thin metal wiresIt has a range of 21ft and causes muscles to twitch uncontrollably.

‘While this is a vital weapon for police to have at their disposal for incidents which pose a risk to the public, police or the alleged perpetrator, it is not something that we use lightly and the incidence of a full discharge remains very low.’

He said Tasers were used on fewer than one per cent of those arrested. ACPO said Tasers posed ‘significantly less risk’ than other methods used by the police such as metal batons, police dogs or CS spray.

Police say the rise in the use of Tasers mirrors the increase in the number of the weapons available to forces – more than 5,500 – and more trained officers.

But the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, has fuelled alarm by suggesting every single policeman or woman, around 130,000, should have a Taser.
