A prestigious university with a Royal seal of approval has brought in the police to stop the growing problems it has with  
drunken anti-social behaviour by its Hooray Henry students.

The Royal Agricultural College, whose alumni includes Princess Anne's ex-husband Captain Mark Phillips and its patron is Prince Charles, has been forced to act to ensure people leave with a 'fine academic record and 
not a police record'.

In the last year its students have been convicted of violent assaults, accused of shooting animals out of their windows and even pushed one ex-soldier over the edge because of persistent anti-social behaviour in Cirencester, Gloucestershire.

In July two students broke the jaw of a fellow student in a violent attack during a students' night event at a local club.

Polo player Adrian Clay, 20, needed surgery on his broken jaw after the beating by fellow Royal Agricultural College students James Guerin and James Fry.

The
pair set on him on several separate occasions during a students’ night 
at a nightclub near the university - called the Rock Club - because 
he bumped into them on the dance floor.

Guerin, 21, of  Netheravon, Salisbury, and Fry, also 21, of Yeovil, 
Somerset, both pleaded not guilty to unlawfully inflicting grievous 
bodily harm on Mr Clay on May 26th 2011 but were found guilty by the 
jury.

Mr Clay had told
the jury he was dancing with a group of female friends when he felt 
himself being constantly being bumped into deliberately by Guerin.

night out

He turned around and asked Mr Guerin if everything was OK, and told 
the jury how Mr Guerin got up close to his face whilst saying ‘What the 
f***, what the f***?’  before repeatedly hitting him.

The second assailant then approached and punched him hard in the face ‘ once or twice, or maybe more.’

Last year, noisy students from the college 'pushed' an ex-soldier to lose his temper and damage cars.

Darren Ford, a member of Cirencester Roundtable, kicked four cars 
outside his Whiteland Road home after becoming increasingly frustrated 
with his young neighbours from the college.

The 37-year-old pleaded guilty to four counts of criminal damage and 
using threatening behaviour.

He told the court he was pushed to his 
limit after two years of problems without a satisfactory resolution.

In October last year students at the College were ticked off by police 
for shooting birds from their bedroom windows on several occasions - 
causing fear and alarm among local householders.

And in April 2011 student Edward Bishop, 20. was sentenced to do unpaid 
work and banned from all licenced premises for six months after he 
punched another man while holding had a glass in his hand.

Bishop pleaded guilty at Gloucester Crown Court to assault causing actual bodily harm on Aaron Bennett.

Now a website has been set up to make sure students from the college are acting in a safely and responsibly.

The Urban Fox website and Twitter account gives advice to students on being more considerate neighbours.

Gloucestershire Constabulary will also be using the Urban Fox site to 
help residents experiencing anti-social behaviour by advising them who 
to contact with complaints. It will also give police advice to students 
about the issues of drugs and drink-driving.

Sergeant Rich Smith, from the local policing team, said: 'We aim to 
prevent issues from developing, but where they do we will be fair and 
robust in dealing with them.

'Following our advice will enable students to leave college with a fine academic record and not a police record.'

Sarah Tennant-Bell, the college’s student liaison officer said today 'We
hope that both students and residents will use this site as an 
information and communication tool.'

Chairman of Cotswold District Council Sir Edward Horsfall added: 'This 
is a great way of enabling students to become more involved in the local
community.

'From the council’s point of view, it will encourage them to use the 
link to our website and learn more about the way we interact with 
residents to deliver a wide of community services, including advice on 
housing and social issues.'

The website, www.urban fox.info, and Twitter account, @urbanfoxciren, has been launched by the college, police and the council.
