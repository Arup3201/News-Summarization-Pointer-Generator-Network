Chinese tourists are expected to flock to Thailand later this week to celebrate Chinese New Year. 

But far from welcoming the holidaymakers, the Thai tourist board will be handing out etiquette manuals outlining how the holidaymakers are expected to behave, following complaints by locals.

The Tourist Authority of Thailand estimates that at least 90,000 tourists will arrive from China this week and has prepared leaflets to hand out as they touch down.

The manual, written in Mandarin, advises against using public property as lavatories and contains general instructions on how to responsibly tour the country. 

Traditionally Chiang Mai and nearby Chiang Rai in the north-east are the biggest draw for Chinese tourists.

But the holidaymakers have become the target of numerous complaints, with locals accusing them of defecating in public places, causing traffic accidents with reckless driving and defacing tourist attractions.

Chinese tourists were recently banned  from even entering Wat Rong Khun, the Buddhist White Temple in Chiang Rai, after complaints that they had ruined the toilets.

Chalermchai Kositpipat, who owns the White Temple, ordered staff to bar visitors following the incident. 

Following complaints from Chinese tourists the ban was lifted on the understanding that tour guides are clean toilets if their clients make a mess.

Photos of a Chinese tourist who draped her underwear on chairs at Chiang Mai airport, outraging fellow travellers, also caused a stir on social media at the beginning of the month, and Thai tourism authorities have asked tour operators to clamp down on inappropriate behaviour.

The guide produced by Thailand focuses on respecting local cultures, keeping with the local traffic laws, and observing museum etiquette such as not touching paintings.

In response to the tales of recent embarrassing Chinese tourist behaviour the state-owned China Central Television has also aired TV programs aiming to educate Chinese tourists about international etiquette and expectations from countries visited.

A Chinese tourist incurred the wrath of fellow travellers earlier this month by draping her underwear in Chiang Mai airport as she waited for a flight 

Thailand government spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd urged Thailand citizens to extend patience towards their visitors over the next few days.

It's not the first time a country has had to produce a guide to tourist etiquette: Thailand's Embassy in Japan posted an online manners guide aimed at Thai visitors to its country following complaints about the behaviour of Thai visitors to Japan last year.

The Thai embassy's consular chief penned a list of 10 do's and don'ts including 'Do not use your chopsticks to pick up food for other people'; 'If driving, stop for pedestrians at crosswalks' and 'Just because you have kids doesn't mean you can cut the queue'.
