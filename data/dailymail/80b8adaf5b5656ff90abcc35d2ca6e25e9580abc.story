Parents are being disciplined by teachers for filling their children's lunchboxes with junk food in an attempt to increase students' learning ability.

If a staff member notices a pupil eating preservative-laden treats - the parent is pulled aside to discuss healthier alternative options for their child at a school in Sydney's lower north shore. 

The friendly reminders have not ruffled any feathers among the parents and has resulted in children showing off their new healthier snacks in the school yard.

North Sydney Demonstration School principal Myra Wearne said the initiative was a way to ensure that students reach their learning potential. 

'Our parents trust us to know that we want what is best for their children, and a high-sugar diet is anything but,' Mrs Wearne told Mosman Daily.

'If we see a student with a chocolate bar or a packet of chips in their lunchbox, we will have a personal conversation with the student's parents to remind them that these foods are not suitable and recommend healthy ­alternatives.' 

Rebecca Nash has three children at the Waverton school and although she hasn't been pulled up on her children's lunchbox contents, she said she wouldn't be insulted if it did occur. 

'They say it takes a community to raise a child, and I think that's very true,' Mrs Nash said.

'It starts in the home because that's where children first learn about making healthy choices but it is for teachers to extend on and reinforce.'

The NSW education department stipulates that all public school canteens in NSW must colour code their menus: red means 'occasionally', amber is 'select carefully' and green for 'fill the menu'.

But this policy does not include food that is brought from home.

Nutrition educator and mother-of-one Lynsey Bradley, who runs workshops to help parents with healthy lunchbox ideas, said educating parents about nutrition is essential for their kids' bodies and minds.

'The more emphasis a school puts on healthy eating the better,' Mrs Bradley said.

'Parents play a huge part in their child's wellbeing and I find a lot of the time they don't know what they are doing wrong.'

She emphasised that preservatives, added sugar and high salt levels and the 'energy spikes' created by such ingredients was the biggest issue.

'Obviously there is no problem with your child having a treat but I always encourage parents to try making their own,' she said.

'Homemade banana bread or blueberry muffins are perfect.'
