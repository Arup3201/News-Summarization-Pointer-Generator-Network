From a makeshift office in a mobile home, Joanne Clayton sold data on 3,000 pensioners’ most personal medical conditions.

For just £576, phone numbers and addresses of the physically disabled, diabetics, those with high blood pressure and even 22 people with bladder control problems, were sold on.

The reason for the sale? So a sham pensions company could cold call them and convince them to hand over their cash.

Mrs Clayton, a hypnotherapist who runs Data Bubble Consultancy with her husband Steve, said the consumers were on file after buying medical products, claiming insurance or even simply because they declared their conditions when booking a holiday.

‘If they bought products for mobility or even if they’ve gone on holiday and they’ve ticked to say that they are needing help on the flight, we can then identify that they actually have problems with mobility,’ boasted Mrs Clayton, smiling widely in her caravan. ‘It may be that they’ve booked a holiday and they’ve claimed a higher risk insurance or if they’ve ticked disabled to go on to the plane.’

The Mail’s undercover team contacted Data Bubble after being tipped off that Mrs Clayton, 46, and her football fanatic husband, 45, had sold data to suspected fraudsters.

The couple, who are from Bradford, outline their qualifications and ambitions in online profiles. Mrs Clayton says on Friends Reunited that she loves ‘my present job within Direct Marketing. Even set up my own company so can’t be that bad eh!’ After her first failed marriage, Mrs Clayton married Steve, a former banker who specialised in debt recovery, 11 years ago.

Within minutes of our reporter’s first call with Mrs Clayton, she explained how she could sell a ‘custom list’ of contact details passed on by a variety of big name firms

They usually run Data Bubble from their £200,000 four-bedroom home in Bradford, but are currently trading in data while travelling abroad, apparently in a mobile home.

Within minutes of our reporter’s first call with Mrs Clayton, she explained how she could sell a ‘custom list’ of contact details passed on by a variety of big name firms.

‘The information actually comes from a database of companies such as magazine subscriptions, finance companies, insurance companies, as well as then holiday companies, people that buy mail order.

‘So all these different companies contribute towards this particular database to then create one big, one transactional database. And from that, that’s how we can then make selections,’ she explained.

A follow-up email outlined the data they were selling, broken down into hundreds of categories of different people cold calling firms might like to target.

Among them were lists of those who had pensions, who taken out loans, read specific newspapers and even lists of parents broken down by the age of their children, from one to 17. Other categories were dedicated to those with conditions including osteoporosis, arthritis, back trouble, hearing difficulties and diabetes.

In total, Data Bubble claimed its consumer database held 42million records covering 24million households. This equates to every household in the UK.

Mrs Clayton would not meet our reporter in person because, she said, she was out of the country. Instead, she spoke in a follow-up meeting on the internet call programme Skype, waving, smiling and giving thumbs up during discussions about medical data. She spoke from what appeared to be a mobile home. Mrs Clayton explained: ‘Different ailments – it could be people that have bought mobility products from a catalogue.

‘Even if they’ve gone on holiday and they’ve ticked to say that they are needing mobility.’

Asked who buys this data, she replied: ‘People that are selling beds or selling mobility scooters or them types of products.’ But she was happy to sell the same data to the Mail’s fake pensions firm to target disabled pensioners with investment cold calls.

She sold 3,000 of these records to an undercover reporter with no checks on the Mail’s supposed firm. Had she done any due diligence she would have found that it was not a registered or regulated company at all. The cost was £576 – just 16p per record plus VAT.

Later it emerged that Mrs Clayton had no idea whatsoever where the data had come from. In an email about the information to controversial data firm B2C Data, which was passed on to the Mail, she wrote: ‘I’m guessing you have provided all of these.’

B2C Data insisted it had not provided the records.

In a follow up call with the undercover reporter, she was asked if she knew which companies supplied the mobility data. ‘No, I don’t know,’ she admitted. ‘Even the list owner has got an agreement.

‘If I turn round to their staff and say please can you tell me which specific company, they’ll turn round and says that they do not know. They’re not allowed to give that information out.’

When confronted with the Mail’s evidence, Mrs Clayton denied any wrongdoing.

‘We are a reputable data broker which supplies data legally,’ she said.

She claimed she had done ‘nothing illegal’ by selling the data, which contained only the names of those who had opted in to having their details passed on.
