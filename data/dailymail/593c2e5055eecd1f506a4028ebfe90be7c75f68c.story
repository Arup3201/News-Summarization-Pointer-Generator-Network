An orangutan at a Cleveland zooÂ  has become the of it's kind in North America to receive an implanted birth control device.

Two doctors, including a gynecologist from the Cleveland Clinic, implanted the contraceptive into the 10-year-old orangutan named Kitra on Tuesday morning.

Not wanting to separate her from the group in which she lives, which includes her mother and father, the zoo worked to find a safe alternative for her.

Orangutans are social animals, explained zoo spokesperson Sue Allen.

Growing up: Kitra the orangutan received the first U.S. inserted contraceptive to an orangutan Tuesday after her Cleveland zoologist heard of the process successfully done overseas

Having tried with negative results other contraceptives to prevent pregnancy with the primates, the clinic's Gynecologist Dr Judith Volkar worked with the zoo's Dr. Mike Selig to implant a contraceptive called Implanon at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo after hearing of its success with primates in Europe.

Dr Volkar has inserted this kind of contraceptive before in humans, for whom it was originally designed, but Kitra was her personal first orangutan. Dr Selig's who learned from her.

The Implanon contraceptive, about an inch-and-a-half in length and slightly thicker than lead found in a pencil, is inserted in the arm.

Typically the Implanon contraceptive is recommended to be changed every three years.

Method: The chosen Implanon contraceptive, about an inch-and-a-half in length and slightly thicker than lead found in a pencil, was designed for humans and is inserted in the arm

Being a young and developing Bornean orangutan, General curator Geoffrey Hall says the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo isn't ready for her to breed, at least not yet.

The zoo reported the procedure to have gone well and Kitra back on her feet within hours.

'We as humans have received so much from the animals,' Dr Volkar told Cleveland.com after the procedure.

'It's good to be able to give something back,' she said.

Home and family: The orangutan from the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo lives in their rainforest portion with her mother, father and two others making her separation from the others for fear of her becoming pregnant cruel if a contraceptive wasn't found

Kitra was re-introduced to the zoo's Rain Forest exhibit that contains four other orangutans.

In exchange for her help, Dr. Volkar was given a backstage tour of the zoo's more exotic animals and got to sit on a giant tortoise.

When asked if she had ever had the opportunity at the Cleveland Clinic, Dr Volkar said: 'Never. Not once.'

The zoo's Aldabra tortoise is described as being the size of a coffee table and weighting around 400 pounds.
