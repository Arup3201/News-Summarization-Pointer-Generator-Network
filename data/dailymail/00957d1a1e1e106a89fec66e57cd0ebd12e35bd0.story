A seven-year-old girl was left with facial injuries after an armed police officer accidentally fired a gun during a demonstration for winners of a colouring competition.

The incident, which left the girl with a minor injury to her lip, happened at Nottinghamshire Police's headquarters while a group of children and parents were being shown around the building in the Arnold area of the city. 

The weapon was fired during a lunchtime visit on October 30 but the police force only made a public statement today after details of the incident were leaked.

An investigation has been launched following what a force spokesman described as 'an accidental discharge of a police-issued firearm into the ground'.

The officer, a trained firearms expert, has been taken off firearms duties pending the inquiry's outcome.   

Assistant Chief Constable Simon Torr, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: 'We are conducting a thorough inquiry to determine exactly how this unfortunate incident happened and have also referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

'We have spoken to the parents, who were visiting force headquarters with their children, to explain what happened and have apologised for any distress caused.' 

The group were enjoying an escorted tour of Sherwood Lodge, where they were shown 'specialist services' including dogs, firearms and traffic cars.

After a short talk about the weapons, the gun was accidentally fired at the ground, injuring the child.   

A force spokesman added: 'It happened around 12.15pm on Thursday, October 30 during an escorted visit to Sherwood Lodge by a group of children and parents who were being shown specialist services including dogs, firearms and traffic cars.

'At the end of a brief talk from firearms officers there was an accidental discharge of a police issued firearm into the ground.

'Following the incident a seven year old Nottinghamshire girl, who was part of the visiting group, was found with a minor injury to her lip.

'The cause of that injury will now form part of the investigation. The officer involved is currently not on firearms duties, pending the outcome of the investigation.'
