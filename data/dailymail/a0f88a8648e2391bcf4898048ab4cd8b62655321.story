CCTV images have been released by police investigating a mass brawl between Swansea and Cardiff City fans which brought terror to an afternoon at the races.

Between 50 and 60 people clashed in front of families at Newbury Racecourse in Berkshire at around 4pm on July 14.

It is thought the violence erupted on the ground floor of the grandstand and then spread to the racecourse, marring what should have been an enjoyable afternoon at the Newbury Summer Festival.

Thames Valley Police tonight released eight CCTV images of men they want to speak to in connection with the disorder.

'We will not tolerate this kind of behaviour and are determined to bring to justice all those responsible.'

The video shows stewards from the racecourse, dressed in blue jackets, trying to separate a group of men throwing punches at each other.

Around a minute into the film a man with his shirt bloodied is led away by a steward as paramedics rush to the scene.

Skirmishes and scuffles then continue to break out for the rest of the video.

According to Thames Valley Police, the fighting lasted around 15 minutes and bars around the circuit had to be closed before officers brought the disorder under control.

Anyone with information should call Thames Valley Police on 101, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
