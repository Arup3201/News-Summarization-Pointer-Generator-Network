An elementary school teacher and mother-of-four who was shot and killed by her estranged husband who then turned the gun on himself had been denied an emergency restraining order against him less than a week before.

Kim Conover, 43, who taught at a 
Petaluma elementary school in San Francisco, was shot by Kevin Conover, 41, outside her divorce lawyer's office on Sunday around 2pm.

Police had been called out to the couple five times over the past year to investigate complaints of domestic abuse and in one case, an allegation that Conover pushed one of his step-daughters, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

The couple had only been married two years but were former high school classmates. They had 21-month-old twins together.

Kim Conover had requested an emergency protective order six days before 
she was killed, alleging that her husband had grabbed her earlier that 
day, Lt Tim Lyons said.

An officer interviewed Kevin Conover, who denied any 
wrongdoing, police said. But the officer felt he was a threat to Kim Conover and requested an emergency stay-away order from a judge at Marcoida of Sonoma County Superior Court.

The judge denied it after finding no evidence that Kim Conover was in immediate danger, authorities said.

Kim leaves behind two daughters from a previous relationship who are aged 12 and 15 as well as her twins. She had filed for a divorce from Kevin about two months ago.

A family member told the Petaluma Patch that Conover was not willing to let his wife go, had been stalking her and even turning up at her work since they had split up.

In a statement issued on Monday, Kevin Conover's 
sister, Bonnie Conover Gibson, said: 'We are devastated by Sunday's 
events. Our hearts go out to (Kim Conover's family) for their senseless 
loss, especially to Kim's daughters.

'We appreciate and are eternally 
grateful for the love and support being shown in the community for all 
of us impacted by this tragedy.'

Kim Conover was a second-grade teacher at Meadow Elementary School. Principal Melissa Becker told the San Francisco Chronicle that telling the students of her death was the 'worst thing she ever had to do'.

She described the mother-of-two as an 'all-star teacher. She was the whole package.

'She was vivacious, she
was energetic, she was positive. She came to work every day with a big 
smile on her face. She's a bright light in the world.'
