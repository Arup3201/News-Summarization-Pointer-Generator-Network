The horrors of trench life have been well documented, but now it seems British soldiers on the Western Front had more than just shells and bullets to contend with.

A grisly list of the most common injuries and ailments endured by men serving in the First World War reveals sexually transmitted diseases, haemorrhoids and wasp stings were among the most debilitating.

While gunshot wounds, trench foot and mustard gas poisoning feature heavily in the previously unseen archive, the men also often went sick with diseases such as gonorrhoea and syphilis according to researchers, who have painstakingly transcribed 30,000 medical records.

Millions of soldiers had to contend with sexually transmitted diseases, hemorrhoids and arthritis on top of being shot at and shelled in the trenches of the First World War, records released today show

Experts say STDs were rife in the First World War as soldiers often visited French brothels looking for 'warmth and comfort' to escape the horrors of the trenches. 

Piles were a persistent problem for the men brought about by the cold ground they had to sit on coupled with the lack of care over their personal hygiene.

Rheumatism was another hindrance as soldiers were unable to stand up tall in the trenches in case they were picked off by a German sniper.

The increased pressure on their knees and ankle joints from having to constantly crouch down led to complaints of arthritis despite their relatively young age.

And a rather surprising ailment that often had to be treated by medics was wasp stings.

Researchers from the military genealogy website Forces War Records are in the process of transcribing and digitising 1.5 million unseen medical records from the First World War that are held at the National Archives at Kew, west London.

They have completed the first tranche of 30,000 records that will be available online for people to search their ancestors from tomorrow.

It is expected that it will take another two years to transcribe and upload the whole archive.

This is the first time such records have been accessible to the wider public.

Experts say it is invaluable as, while information on soldiers who were killed was recorded, hardly any exists for those who were injured and survived.

Most medical records were destroyed after the First World War or during the Blitz of London in World War Two.

The records being made available now came from the Royal Army Medical Corps, in particular the 51st Field Ambulance, a frontline medical unit.

Dominic Hayhoe, chief executive of Forces War Records, said: 'For those killed in battle, names can generally be found in rolls of honour, war diaries or names on a cenotaph.

'However, for personnel who were injured and survived, military information tends to be very scarce. An entry in a medical register might be the only record of their WW1 service.

'They can show who was treated, for what and their movements after being patched up or taken to hospital.

'Wet, cold, squalid conditions of trench warfare brought with it untold discomfort and suffering.

'From conditions such as gunshot wounds, trench foot and mustard gas poisoning to tonsillitis, Spanish flu and even in-growing toenails, few men escaped unscathed.

'These records are priceless pieces of information for families looking up their ancestor's past. Unless they had been killed, many went through the war largely undocumented.

'A soldier who was killed or badly injured in action would often make the news back home but one suffering from haemorrhoids would not, understandably.'

To coincide with the release of information, Forces War Records has also published an e-book called Trench Traumas and Medical Miracles that explains in layman's terms some of the medical procedures carried out.

The e-book also contains a top 20 list of the most common complaints among the men.

The unique research has shown that seemingly benign wounds, like a cut to the finger, often led to much more serious illness and infection due to the level of bacteria in the trenches

Ceri Gage, curator of collections at the Army Medical Services Museum in Aldershot, Hants, has helped the researchers with their work.

She said: 'This is an invaluable source of research that gives people the opportunity to trace an ancestor, the type of injury or ailment they suffered and what happened to them afterwards.

'The top 20 list is the most accurate breakdown of ailments soldiers suffered in the trenches.

'Infections presented the biggest problem. A simple cut to a finger from cleaning your gun or digging a trench could quite quickly become infected and develop into pneumonia.

'The men were knee deep in mud nine out of 12 months of the year surrounded by bacteria from the bodies of men and animals in No Man's Land.

'Their bodies were weaker anyway from a lack of sleep, wet and dirty clothes and a restricted diet in which a piece of fruit or vegetable was a treat.' 

The unique research has shown that seemingly benign wounds, like a cut to the finger, often led to much more serious illness and infection due to the level of bacteria in the trenches.

It also highlights that, apart from being shot or hit by a shell fragment, one of the most deadly injuries a soldier could suffer was a broken leg, even from an innocuous fall.

Injured Tommies were jolted and banged about so much during their journey on a stretcher from the front to a field ambulance and a casualty station that the fractured femur bone would often rupture an artery.

During the early part of the war, a soldier with a broken leg had an 80 per cent chance of dying but after the Thomas traction splint came into use in 1916 that rate went down to just seven per cent.
