A mother and daughter found seriously injured in a hotel may have had a suicide pact, police have revealed.

Foster mother Margaret McDonough, 52, was found dying in a Scottish hotel room last Friday after suffering severe ‘slashing’ injuries. Her 23-year-old daughter Nicola was found bleeding in the corridor outside, with similar wounds, and police announced soon afterwards that they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the tragedy.

Both women died in hospital in Greenock, Renfrewshire, with relatives spending three days by Nicola’s bedside before she succumbed to her injuries on Monday.

Mother and daughter: Nicola McDonough, 23, died three days after Margaret, 52, died in hospital in Greenock

Detectives yesterday confirmed they 
are investigating whether there was a double suicide attempt by the 
mother and daughter. It is a line of inquiry which has emerged after 
police ruled out an attack by a third party and said the pair were 
definitely in their hotel room alone.

A source at the Premier Inn in 
Greenock, where the two women were found, said yesterday officers told 
her it was a suspected double suicide.

A spokeswoman for Police Scotland 
said: ‘This is part of the investigation and is a line of enquiry we are
looking at. Officers are speaking to friends and family to try and 
understand what has happened in Margaret and Nicola McDonough’ s lives 
leading up to these events. There are ongoing forensic tests.

‘We do know that we are not looking 
for anyone else in connection with these deaths and we are still 
appealing with information.’

Detectives are understood to have 
asked relatives if the two women were left or right-handed, to ascertain
whether their injuries were self-inflicted.

A post-mortem has been carried out on
the body of Mrs McDonough, who died in hospital on Friday, shortly 
after being found in the hotel room. One has not yet been carried out 
for Nicola, who spent three days in a critical condition before dying at
the Royal Inverclyde Hospital in Greenock.

The mother and daughter checked into 
the Premier Inn at 3.50pm last Thursday from their home in Paisley. They
were reported missing by family members that afternoon, reportedly 
after Mrs McDonough failed to pick up her two young foster children from
nursery.

They were spotted at various 
locations before returning to the hotel just before 1am, including 
Balloch in West Dunbartonshire and Paisley – although they did not 
return home.

Margaret discovered insideAfternoon - Margaret dies from her injuries. Nicola remains in intensive care in a critical condition.

Monday night - Nicola dies from her injuries.

Police said last night the only two 
people who know exactly what happened in their hotel room that night are
the two women, who were both found severely injured by a hotel guest at
7am the next day.

Detectives had pinned their hopes on interviewing Nicola but she died before she could provide answers.

The Liberal Democrat council 
candidate split from husband Thomas McDonough in 2008, after 28 years of
marriage. Mr McDonough, 56, who kept a constant vigil by his daughter 
Nicola’s hospital bed, now lives in Blairgowrie, Perthshire, with a 
43-year-old woman called Lindsay Durward listed at the same address.

Nicola is believed to have remained close to her father and was friends on social networking site Facebook with Miss Durward.

But a family friend said: ‘The end of
the marriage hit Margaret very hard and she was very upset. She stayed 
on her own after that and was single - she was not looking for another 
man to replace the one she had lost.’

Mrs McDonagh became a foster mother, 
taking in two children aged two and five for Renfrewshire Council – a 
boy and a girl, who she is believed to have considered adopting. They 
are now back in the foster care system and will be placed in another 
home.

Mrs McDonagh also stood twice for 
election as a Liberal Democrat council candidate, while her daughter 
this year graduated with a social work degree from the University of 
West Scotland and works at charity Cosgrove Care.

Police at the Premier Inn where the two women were discovered with what officers called 'slashing injuries'

Her siblings, Matthew, Michael, Kevin
and Margaret are struggling to come to terms with the two deaths, 
police said last night. A report into the deaths has been sent to the 
procurator fiscal and the possibility of either of the two women 
attacking the other has not been ruled out.

Detective Inspector David Wagstaff of
Police Scotland said: ‘This has obviously been a difficult and 
traumatic time for the family. Firstly they had to cope with Margaret’s 
death and now Nicola’s, with little time to grieve.

‘We will continue to make every effort to find answers for the family.’
