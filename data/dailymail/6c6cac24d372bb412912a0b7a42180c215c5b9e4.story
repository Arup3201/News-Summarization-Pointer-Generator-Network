Two proud parents with nine children under the age of seven have welcomed home the first of their new quintuplets - as they swear they didn't use fertility drugs to conceive them.

Evonne and Deon Derrico from Las Vegas already had a seven-year-old daughter, a three-year-old son and one-year-old twin boys when they learned they were pregnant with five more babies.

Evonne gave birth to two boys and three girls at the Banner Desert Medical Center on September 6, and this weekend, they brought home three of the newborns to a very excited welcoming committee.

Speaking with the Today show, the parents shared their joy at having most of their family home.

Nearly there! Evonne and Deon Derrico, pictured on the Today show on Monday, have welcomed home three of their five quintuplets. The couple now has nine children under the age of seven

Joy: The couple, pictured with three-year-old Deon and one-year-old twins Dallas and Denver, looked surprisingly relaxed as they said everyone is getting enough sleep and they are sticking to a schedule

'I wanted a large family,' Evonne said. 'No one 
expects that overnight but I wanted a large family... So this is just a blessing from God. It really is. It's a dream come true.'

The couple hopes to bring another of the newborns home next week and the final baby - Daiten, who was born weighing less than two pounds - the following week.

'As a mother with nine children, you often
think, "Do I have enough love for all of them?"' Evonne said. 'I think that's been my 
number one priority. I don't want anyone to 
feel neglected or unloved.'

Their doctor had initially told the Derricos that they were expecting four babies, before revealing that there were actually five.

Back home: Three of the babies, who were born after 32 weeks on September 6, have returned home to the family in Las Vegas. The other two babies will go home over the next two weeks

When quintuplets are not all the same gender, they could be fraternal quintuplets or a mixture of identical and fraternal.

Fraternal
quintuplets are conceived when five separate eggs are released by the 
mother and each egg is fertlized by a different sperm. But having quintuplets this way naturally is extremely rare.

Instead, quintuplets of different genders could be
a mixture of fraternals and identicals.

In identical twins or triplets,
the mother releases an egg which is fertilized by one sperm before 
splitting to form identical twins or identical triplets.

This means that the Derrico quintuplets could have been formed in a number of ways. All could be from five separate eggs (fraternal) or from as few as two eggs (a set of twins and a set of triplets), three eggs (two sets of twins and another egg), three eggs with a different combination (one set of twins and two other eggs), four eggs (one set of twins and three other eggs) or any similar combination.

At
22 weeks of pregnancy, after they discovered they were expecting 
quintuplets, the family moved to suburban Phoenix for care from Dr. John
Elliott, a perinatologist and multiple-birth specialist.

After spending her last trimester on bed rest, Evonne gave birth after carrying the babies to 32 weeks - and nearly doubled the family in less than five minutes.

Each was delivered between 11.17am and 11.21am on Friday, September 6.

In keeping with family tradition, the babies' names all start with the letter 'D': Deniko, Dariz, Deonee, Daician and Daiten.

They joined the Derricos' seven-year-old daughter, Dai, a 
three-year-old son, Deon, and one-year-old twin boys, Dallas and 
Denver.

The mother didn't know the babies'
genders prior to birth, hospital officials said, and she announced 
'boy' or 'girl' as each baby was presented to her in the delivery room.

Even
though they already had twins and have other multiple births in their 
families, the couple was stunned. Doctors said they chances of her 
carrying quintuplets was one in a couple of million.

'We're not shocked to have the twins,' Deon told Today. 'We 
wouldn't have been that shocked to have had twins again, but we could 
have never expected this.'

Making his entrance: Deniko was the first of the
quintuplets to arrive at 11.17am on Friday September 6

Tiny tot: Dariz was the next boy to arrive one minute later - all weighed less than three pounds at birth

Here come the girls: Deonee was the first sister born at 11:19am - their genders were not known prior to birth

Give me five: Daician was the next girl to be born, one minute after Deonee

Under surveillance: Daiten was the last of the 
quintuplets to be born at 11:21am - and although she has put on a pound since she was born, she is expected to return home in about two weeks

Growing: Deon and Evonne Derrico with their 
four children, Dallas, Denver, Deon and Dai, before the quintuplets

Now the family is just trying to find 
out their normal routine, but the parents grinned as they said they 
think they're already on track.

'Everything is going good and we're all getting sleep and it's working out amazingly well,' Evonne said.

After the births, the family of 11 told the Las Vegas Sun that they have to make some adjustments.

'We
have a vehicle for the family right now, but we don't have a vehicle 
for the five others,' said Mr Derrico, who works as a field property 
manager. 'There's just so much to figure out.'

The Derrico quintuplets were the fifth set of out-of-state quints delivered at Banner Desert Hospital in the past year.
