September 11 survivors and victims' families are outraged over a gift shop attached to the new 9/11 museum in Lower Manhattan.

The store associated with the National September 11 Memorial & Museum sells items ranging from key chains to NYPD dog vests marketed off the tragedy.

For sale: The new museum's gift shop sells t-shirts, stuffed animals, key chains and other products marketed off the tragedy

Jewelry, mousepads, magnets, flags, pins, stuffed animals, cellphone cases, toy firetrucks and much more are available for purchase. 

According to the museum's website, the proceeds benefit 'developing and sustaining' the memorial which is run by executives with privately-funded six-figure salaries. 

The idea of a gift shop alone is offensive to many, but is made even more painful considering 8,000 unidentified remains of victims were recently moved to a tomb beneath the museum.

'Here is essentially our tomb of the unknown. To sell baubles I find quite shocking and repugnant,' Diane Horning, who lost her  26-year-old son Matthew in the attacks, told the New York Post.

Matthew worked as a database administrator for Marsh & McLennan, an insurance firm which had offices in the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Matthew's remains were never recovered.

'I think it's a money-making venture to support inflated salaries, and they're willing to do it over my son's dead body,' Mrs Horning said.

Joe Daniels, the memorial and museum's CEO, makes $378,000 a year, though his and other executives' six-figure salaries are funded through private donations.

Still, the idea of a gift shop doesn't sit well with many close to the tragedy, who believe it could have been kept closed until Wednesday, when the museum opens to the public.

President Obama dedicated the museum in a moving speech on Thursday, and the memorial has since only been open to survivors and victims' families.

'These people are suffering, and they don't need to be reaching into their pockets,' John Feal, a former Ground Zero demolition survivor, told the Post. 'The museum could have gone six days without asking for money.'

However, Feal, who runs the FealGood Foundation for ailing 9/11 workers, says he understands the museum's need to sell items in order to cover costs.

The museum plans to operate on a $63million budget with money raised through admission fees and donations.

'All net proceeds from our sales are dedicated to developing and sustaining the national September 11 Memorial & Museum,' the museum's website reads. 'Thank you for helping to build a lasting place for remembrance, reflection, and learning for years to come.'

The gift shop itself was funded with a $5million donation from Paul Napoli and Marc Bern, partners in a law firm which made $200,0000 representing 10,000 Ground Zero workers in a lawsuit.

That's $5million Feal believes should have been donated to the 'sick and suffering - their former clients'.
