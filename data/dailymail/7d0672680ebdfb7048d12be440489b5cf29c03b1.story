An Arizona State University freshman fell 10 stories to her death from an off-campus apartment balcony early Sunday morning, police said.

Naomi McClendon, 18, from Manhattan, Kansas, appeared to have been drunk when she slumped over the railing before her fatal plunge, authorities said surveillance footage showed. Foul play is not suspected.

A Temple Police Department spokesperson told Fox 10 that the tragic death was simply an accident and that they believe alcohol is the only culprit since she was alone on the balcony.

Where it happened: McClendon fell from a top-floor balcony in this Tempe apartment complex

‘It looks like she straddles the railing and lays down on top of the railing,’ said Tempe Police Sergeant Mike Pooley. ‘Half of her body on the railing and the other half dangling,

‘At one point she looks like she starts to slip’ he continued, ‘realizes what is happening, tries to catch herself, and, unfortunately, it is too late,’

The footage showed only her on the railing, her friends were inside the apartment when she fell.

‘We are very confident that there was nobody else on that balcony with her,’ Pooley added. ‘We are very confident that she was alone and it was just a horrible thing.’

Officers have learned she had spent the night at a party and are looking further into who supplied her with alcohol.

The footage also showed her staggering around while holding onto railings as she struggled to maintain her balance, Pooley told AZ Central, saying she appeared to be 'extremely intoxicated.'

The horrific death was the talk of the apartment complex.

‘I woke up and friends were talking about it. Yeah someone fell off one of the balconies and died,’ Michael Chang lamented.

McClendon had only left home to start school last year. She was part of a band, where she played keyboard, with boyfriend Noah Schmidt – he lashed out angrily online after hearing of her death.

‘You took away the most amazing person you ever created. F**k you God,’ he wrote on Facebook.

Dozens
 of people offered up their condolences in comments below the angry 
outburst, but all he could do was post pictures of his lost love.

‘I’m so sorry Noah,’ a friend wrote.

Police are confident the death was an accident, but told Fox 10 they will run a toxicology report to see if drugs were in McClendon’s system.

Authorities also want to know where she was able to obtain alcohol since she is not of legal age to drink.

'She was a party earlier in the area,' Pooley told KPHO. 'That's part of the investigation. We're trying to figure out where she was at and where she was coming from.'
