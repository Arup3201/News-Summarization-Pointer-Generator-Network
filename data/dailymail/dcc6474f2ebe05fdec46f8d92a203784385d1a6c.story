Supply teacher Christine Page, 57, has been banned from the classroom for the rest of the year after a £6,000 council tax and housing benefit scam

A benefits cheat supply teacher has been banned from the classroom for the rest of the year after a £6,000 council tax and housing benefit scam. 

Christine Page, 57, wrongly claimed housing and council tax benefit while being paid as a supply teacher to cover for other staff at Penally Primary School in Tenby, West Wales.

A disciplinary hearing was told Page was expected to be a 'role model' at school, which has since become the Penally Centre for children with behavioural difficulties, but instead fraudulently claimed £6,860 in benefits.

The General Teaching Council for Wales heard that she had been given a £5,249 pay out after she was made redundant in 2007. 

She was later convicted at Swansea Crown after being found guilty of failing to declare this money to Pembrokeshire County Council.

When she was sentenced in January 2012, Page was given a community order, requiring her to complete 200 hours of unpaid work.

She has since got a new job as a cover supervisor at another school.

A disciplinary panel, sitting in Cardiff, heard Page had falsely claimed benefits for three years. 

Case presenter Rhiannon Dale said: 'Teachers are expected to provide pupils with a moral compass'.

'This is not a matter of a trivial offence - the behaviour lasted over a three and a half year period and resulted in a considerable loss of public funds.'

'Her actions have been inconsistent with those expected of a registered teacher and could bring the profession into disrepute.'

The committee imposed a suspension order, specifying that her name will be removed from the teaching register until August 31.

This means she will not be able to teach until the next school year.
