The world's population looks set to smash through the seven billion this year - an increase of one billion in just a decade.

Findings also reveal that by 2050 the world's population will swell to over nine billion. 

The 10 billion mark is expected to be passed by 2100, although depending on birth rates the population could be as high as 15.8 billion at the start of the 22nd Century.

Populations of developed countries such as the UK and USA will remain flat, but will age, with fewer adults of working age to support those who have retired

Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, USA, in conjunction with the UN, said the swelling population size would bring 'unprecedented global economic demographic upheaval.'

They also claim that almost all (97 per cent) of the projected 2.3 billion increase in population will occur in less developed regions, with nearly half [49 per cent] in Africa.

By contrast, the populations of developed countries such as the UK and USA will remain flat, but will age, with fewer adults of working age to support those who have retired and are living on pensions.

While the world's population took until 1800 to reach one billion, it has grown rapidly in the past two centuries, swelling from three to seven billion in the last half century alone.

In 2011 135 million people are predicted to be born, while 57 million will die - a net increase of 78 million people. 

There is some debate over how accurate the projections are, with changes in birth rates meaning that by 2050 the population could be two billion lower than predicted, at eight billion, and by 2100 it could be as low as 6.2 billion, or as high as 15.8 billion.

Study author Professor David Bloom, from the department of economics and demographics at Harvard University, said: 'Although the issues immediately confronting developing countries are different from those facing the rich countries, in a globalized world demographic challenges anywhere are demographic challenges everywhere.

'The world's population has grown slowly for most of human history. It took until 1800 for the population to hit 1 billion.

'However, in the past half-century, population jumped from 3 to 7 million.  'In 2011, approximately 135 million people will be born and 57 million will die, a net increase of 78 million people. Considerable uncertainty about these projections remains.

'Depending on whether the number of births per woman continues to decline, the ranges for 2050 vary from 8.1 to 10.6 billion, and the 2100 projections vary from 6.2 to 15.8 billion.' 

Prof Bloom, whose teams' results are printed in journal Science added: 'Population trends indicate a shift in the 'demographic centre of gravity' from more to less developed regions.

'Already strained, many developing countries will likely face tremendous difficulties in supplying food, water, housing, and energy to their growing populations, with repercussions for health, security, and economic growth.' 

He concluded: 'The demographic picture is indeed complex, and poses some formidable challenges.

'Those challenges are not insurmountable, but we cannot deal with them by sticking our heads in the sand. 

'We have to tackle some tough issues ranging from the unmet need for contraception among hundreds of millions of women and the huge knowledge-action gaps we see in the area of child survival, to the reform of retirement policy and the development of global immigration policy. 

'It's just plain irresponsible to sit by idly while humankind experiences full force the perils of demographic change.'
