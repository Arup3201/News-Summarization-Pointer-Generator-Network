He might just be what England manager Roy Hodgson is looking for. Prince Harry went in goal for a penalty shoot-out yesterday and saved every one.

Admittedly, the goal was mini-sized – and the kicks were taken by children.

But given England’s dismal record of being knocked out on penalties at major tournaments, could it be worth giving Harry a late call-up for the World Cup in Brazil?

You'll never beat me! Harry saves every kick in the penalty shoot-out

Catch: The tiny goals may have helped the prince maintain his spotless record

The prince showed off his goalkeeping skills on a visit to the Inspire Suffolk community project in Ipswich.

Wearing tracksuit bottoms and a polo shirt with the England rugby logo on it, Harry was clearly in a boisterous mood as he began the kick-around as an outfielder.

Aryon Tandel, nine, said: ‘He tackled me and won the ball but I managed to tackle him back. He was taking it quite seriously.’

Brandon Norman, eight, scored a goal against Harry’s team.

Good sport: A handshake from the prince

‘He gave me a tap around the ear and said well done,’ Brandon said. The prince, vice patron of the Rugby Football Union, also joined in a game of touch rugby.

George Hill, nine, said: ‘He told me I had to stay behind the ball and joked that if I went in front again he would slap me.’

Harry met participants in the Prince’s Trust Team Programme, which helps disadvantaged young people, then travelled to the Suffolk Show to meet young farmers and watch a Royal British Legion parade.
