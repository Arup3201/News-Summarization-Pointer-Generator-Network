An alleged thief nicknamed the 'Gumball Bandit' may have had his bubble burst for good.

Police nabbed suspect Jason Bietch, 39, of Scarsdale, New York, on Thursday whom they believe is responsible for stealing over 100 gumball machines from various establishments in the Bronx so that he could re-sell them to fuel a drug habit.

The New York Post reports that Bietch was suspected on February 5 when he was spotted allegedly stealing two 75-pound gumball machines worth $350 each from a Wash & Dry in the Parkchester by the store's disgruntled owner.

'All of a sudden he grabbed the machine and started running,' said manager Ramon Rivera, 46, who chased the suspect to the street told The New York Daily News.

'He slipped on the ice and so I had enough time to see his license plate,' he said.

'It was GUM and four other numbers. I couldn’t believe it. It’s crazy his license plate said GUM.'

Bietch was able to leave the Laundromat with the gumball machine but the owner didn't believe his lie that he worked for Great American Vending who refills the machine every month so he reported the theft to police.

When police spoke with the company Great American Vending the company informed them that 100 of their gumball machines had been lifted from stores around the area.

Bietch was caught at a probation meeting on Thursday and now faces charges related to grand and petite larceny.

He is also accused of stealing a $1,500 candy dispenser from another Laundromat on Bainbridge Avenue in The Bronx.

Police said they're unsure as to how much the 100 machines were worth but they believe Bietch was re-selling them in order to fuel his drug habit.

The New York Post reports that Bietch was arrested twice in 2014, once for aggravated unlicensed operation of a vehicle and another time for possession of heroin.

'He’s not the brightest guy,' said a police officer.

'He thought they would be easy scores, but he didn't count on the cameras.'

'They wear a uniform, act like they come from a company,' said store owner Louie Cordero to ABC. 

'He's hit small mom and pop stores. We're upset, with that money we pay the gas, the light,' Cordero said.

Baffled: Store owner Louie told reporters, 'he's hit small mom and pop stores. We're upset, with that money we pay the gas, the light,'
