Polish and Israeli Holocaust researchers say they have discovered the exact location of the building that housed gas chambers at Sobibor, one of the death camps operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland.

Israel's Yad Vashem and the Majdanek State Museum in Poland, which oversees Sobibor, announced the finding Wednesday, calling it an important discovery in the field of Holocaust research.

Historians already knew that the Germans operated the gas chambers at Sobibor from April 1942 to October 1943, killing an estimated 250,000 Jews brought from across Europe.

Archaeologists have finally found the exact site of Sobibor death camp after eight years of searching

Thousands of personal items were also recovered, including gold teeth and jewellery

But they have many unanswered questions about the operation of the site because there were very few survivors and most of the site was dismantled during the war by the Germans.

'Any small piece of information we can add to our knowledge is a great thing,' said Yoram Haimi, an Israeli archaeologist who has spent the past eight years digging at the site. The team that found the remains of the building also includes Polish and Dutch archaeologists.

Photos released by the researchers show a sizeable rectangular structure with brick walls that was divided into four chambers. Mr Haimi said they have found a number of personal items nearby, including gold teeth and jewellery.

An estimated 250,000 Jews were killed at the death camp between April 1942 and October 1943

The Germans closed the camp after a prisoner revolt on October 14, 1943, when about 300 of the young inmates killed several German officers and guards with axes and knives

David Silberklang, a historian with Yad Vashem, said the finding will shed light on 'what the Jews went through until they were murdered' and could lead to a more precise estimate of the numbers killed.

The Germans closed the camp after a prisoner revolt on October 14, 1943, when about 600 of the young inmates killed several German officers and guards with axes and knives. Many of the prisoners fled the camp, but all except 52 of them were killed by guards or died in water ditches and mine fields surrounding the camp.

The excavations have been made more difficult because the Nazis tried to destroy all evidence of the death camp after the revolt, and planted crops over the site.

Similarly to Belzec and Treblinka, which the Nazis at around the same time, Sobibor was designed as a death camp, where Jews were gassed almost straight after arriving.

1. The garrison area: This is where the main entrance gates were, and also where the inmates were taken off the trains. The Commander's house was opposite the platform between the guardhouse and the armoury.

2. Camp I: This was made with barbed wire fences and surrounded by a deep, water-filled trench. It was where the Jewish prisoners lived and also included a kitchen. Each prisoner had about one square metre of space to sleep in.

3. Camp II: Around 400 prisoners worked in this larger camp which was used to store killing equipment and also items taken from the prisoners. The Jews were prepared to be killed here, meaning they were undressed and women had their heads shaved. There was a barbed wire-lined pathway which led from here to where they were killed.

4. Camp III: The prisoners were killed here, in the north west area of the camp. Their entrance descended straight down into the gas chambers and was decorated with a Star of David and flowers.
