A pill that blocks the action of a so-called ‘love hormone’ could be a new treatment for premature ejaculation.

The medication – which was developed by UK scientists - is being tested in a clinical trial starting this month.

It treatment targets a hormone called oxytocin which is thought to encourage feelings of bonding, and is released in response to touch. 

Studies show it also increases sexual arousal, and triggers ejaculation.

Hope: The drug stops the hormone oxytocin - which triggers ejaculation - from binding to cells in the body. The idea is that if oxytocin can be blocked, the moment of ejaculation can be delayed

The new drug is a so-called oxytocin-antagonist, which means it stops oxytocin binding to cells in the body. The idea is that if oxytocin can be blocked, the moment of ejaculation can be delayed.

It’s estimated that nearly five million men in the UK suffer from premature ejaculation. The condition means sexual intercourse only lasts a few minutes or even seconds, which can lead to low self-esteem, and relationship difficulties.

For many men the condition is present throughout adulthood, but it can also be triggered by conditions such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, high blood pressure, prostate disease and overactive or underactive thyroid gland.

Treatments include talking therapies, which are designed to help men develop better control of their ejaculatory reflexes, as well as medications such as anaesthetic creams that have a numbing effect.

A type of antidepressant - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - have also been shown to work for some men as they are thought to reduce sexual arousal, although they may trigger side effects such as nausea, headache, insomnia, and dizziness.

One selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor has been designed specially to treat premature ejaculation. But the drug, called dapoxetine, is not suitable for men with heart, kidney and liver problems, and can carry side effects such as headaches and nausea.

Scientists behind the new treatment, which is manufactured by Ixchelsis, say their oxytocin-blocker may provide a viable alternative, and with fewer side effects.

Animal studies at the Université de Versailles-Saint Quentin in France, and published in the British Journal of Pharmacology, have shown that oxytocin blockers can delay premature ejaculation.

Now the drug is being trialled on 90 men aged 18 to 60. In the year-long trial, conducted at various centres in the U.S and Australia, the volunteers will take different doses of the drug one to seven hours before sexual intercourse.

Commenting on the trial, Professor Raj Persad, consultant urological surgeon at Bristol Royal Infirmary said the drug may benefit patients, but cautioned it should be used alongside psychological therapies.

He said: ‘This drug is very interesting, and if trials are successful it could contribute towards treating this distressing condition. 

'But there is more to premature ejaculation than chemical imbalances, and there should always be some input from a psychosexual approach to help deal with relevant background issues that the patient may or may not be consciously aware of.’

Meanwhile, doctors have developed a nasal spray containing oxytocin to treat migraine. In a new trial, patients will use the spray when they start to experience one of the excruciating headaches. 

The idea behind the drug, known as TI-001 and developed by US-based firm Trigemina, is that the drug travels through tissues in the nose to the trigeminal nerve, one of the main nerves in the face, which relays pain signals to the brain. 

The theory is that the drug interferes with these signals.

Small studies have suggested that the new oxytocin formulation is effective. In one trial, 42 per cent of patients had a significant reduction in pain two hours after using the drug, compared with 11 per cent of those in a control group. 

A trial with 240 patients is now underway in Australia and Chile.
