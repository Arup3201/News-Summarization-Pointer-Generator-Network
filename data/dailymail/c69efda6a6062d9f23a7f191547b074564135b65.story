She rose to fame with her large brood on Jon & Kate Plus Eight, before stepping away from the spotlight in 2011.

Now, Kate Gosselin is back in the headlines as she seeks multimillion dollar compensation in a lawsuit filed against ex-husband Jon Gosselin.

As reported by RadarOnline, the mom-of-eight is suing her ex for wiretapping, computer hacking, identity theft and invasion of privacy.

A woman scorned: Kate Gosselin has filed a multimillion dollar lawsuit against ex-husband Jon Gosselin, alleging wiretapping, computer hacking, identity theft and invasion of privacy

Filing paperwork in the United States District Court Of Pennsylvania on Monday, the blonde star has alleged that Jon conspired with his business partner, tabloid reporter Robert Hoffman - who is also named in the lawsuit along with as many as 20 unidentified John and Jane Does - to access her records without her knowledge or permission.

Hoffman is said to have used the information Jon obtained from his former wife's bank accounts and personal email correspondence to pen unauthorised e-book Kate Gosselin: How She Fooled The World.

While the defamatory tome has been pulled from retailers such as Amazon due to the alleged illegal nature in which the information was obtained, the damage was already done.

As her lawyer, A Jordan Rushie, states: 'Jon violated a federal anti-hacking statute in order to publish salacious, scandalous and defamatory information about Kate. It's damaged her reputation.'

Conspiracy theory: Jon is alleged to have conspired against his ex with pal Robert Hoffman, who went on to publish unauthorised and defamatory e-book Kate Gosselin: How She Fooled The World

While Kate has never confirmed the authenticity of the supposed 'journal' extracts that were published in their entirety in Hoffman's book, passages included talk of spanking her children and her fears that she would harm them.

'After the couple was separated, Jon illegally hacked into Kate’s email account and her phone and bank accounts. Jon also stole a hard drive from Kate’s house, which contained private and confidential material,' the suit alleges.

'Jon then gave the contents... to his friend and business partner, tabloid reporter Robert Hoffman.

'Hoffman used the illegally-acquired data to publish a defamatory book about Kate.'

Suit filed: Kate's lawyers filed the 17-page lawsuit in the United States District Court Of Pennsylvania Monday

Conflicting stories: Hoffman says he obtained the hard drive to Kate's computer after rifling through her garbage, however the suit counters, 'He did not find this trove of personal information while engaging in his trash-picking endeavors'

It also goes on to state that Hoffman is still in possession of the material, having 'bragged' that he has 5000 family photos, as well as tax records, personal documents and contracts.

According to Radar, 38-year-old Kate cites that Hoffman falsely alleged that he had recovered said computer data from her garbage after digging through the trash.

'This demonstrates his knowledge that the materials were obtained illegally, as it is a sign of an attempt to cover up his unlawful activities,' the suit states. 'He did not find this trove of personal information while engaging in his trash-picking endeavours.'

Kate Plus Eight: Kate has primary custody of the couple's twins and sextuplets, who rose to fame on TLC series Jon & Kate Plus Eight, since their 2009 divorce

Kate alleges that Hoffman and her ex were cohorts who used the information and 'distorted the facts to make stories more salacious for the tabloids'.

The so-called conspiracy was initially exposed by James McGibney, an anti-bullying activist who revealed the deceit via a number of text messages, which he published on BullyVille.com.

The cell-phone number was confirmed as belonging to father-of-eight Jon and contained such incriminating texts as, 'Grabbing Kate’s computer before she gets home. I need that hard drive,' which was dated October 14, 2009.

Another conversation read: 'I’m giving it to a good friend of mine to hold.

'No one will know. Rob is going to say he took it from our garbage.'

The way they were: The pair were together for 10 years and have had an acrimonious relationship ever since, with Jon allegedly telling ex-girlfriend Hailey Glassman that gaining access to Kate's computer records would 'put the nail in her coffin'

Previously,
in 2009, Radar exposed a series of texts between 36-year-old Jon and 
then-girlfriend Hailey Glassman, in which he talked about wanting to 
gain access to Kate's computer in order to 'put the nail in her coffin'.

The
couple, who married in June 1999 before filing for divorce 10 years and
eight children later, have been anything but amicable since their 
split and have been embroiled in a series of legal issues  during the past few years - including the suspected violation of child labour laws relating to their TLC reality series.

Kate
retains primary custody of 12-year-old daughters Mady and Cara, along 
with nine-year-old sextuplets Alexis, Collin, Joel, Hannah, Leah and 
Aaden.

She is seeking compensatory, punitive, liquidated damages and attorney's fees and costs.
