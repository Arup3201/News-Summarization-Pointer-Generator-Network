A couple who went away empty-handed from a TV quiz show have belatedly scooped £26,000 after Channel 4 admitted producers bungled the answers.

Carlyn Coyle and Scott Carwood were ‘distraught’ in March when they won nothing in Davina McCall’s teatime quiz Five Minutes To A Fortune.

But when the show aired earlier this month, they decided to challenge the official answers and after an investigation, producers paid up.

In the final round, Miss Coyle, a financial analyst from Glasgow, had to name five of the world’s top ten ‘cities with the busiest airports’ in four minutes, as a possible £46,000 jackpot drained away.

She quickly got Paris and London, and later Chicago and Beijing too.

But other answers, including New York, were rejected, leaving her visibly upset at winning nothing. ‘In the dressing room afterwards I was distraught,’ she said: ‘I just burst into tears. I felt terrible.’

But after their game aired, friends urged them to challenge the decision to reject New York.

Although none of its airports is among the world’s busiest, the question asked about cities, and overall the Big Apple would rank.

There were also question marks over Dubai and Hong Kong, which could have ranked had researchers used more up-to-date figures than they did.

A C4 spokesman said: ‘The contestants notified the production company [Victory Television]. They investigated and agreed to pay the couple their winnings.’

Miss Coyle, 23, said: ‘I’m relieved that I am not as daft as I looked on TV.’
