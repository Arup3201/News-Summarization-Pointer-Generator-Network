While most Americans were busy last week gobbling up turkeys, one lucky snorkeler in Florida got up close and personal with a very affectionate sea cow.

Jay Darden, an engineer for the TV station WPBF, recorded a video of his unusual encounter with a manatee in the Crystal River near Tampa over the weekend.

The short clip made with Darden's GoPro camera shows a sea cow swimming up to Darden and embracing his leg with its flippers.

Underwater friendship: Jay Darden was snorkeling in the Crystal River in Florida when a manatee swam up to him and hugged his leg with its flippers

Holy cow! Darden estimated that his sea cow pal was about 8 feet long and weighing 1,000lbs

Darden returned the favor, tickling the gentle giant’s hulking belly with his index finger.

The engineer said his new underwater pal was about 8 feet long and appeared to weigh close to 1,000lbs. 

Crystal River is located in Citrus County - the only part of Florida where people are allowed to touch manatees if they approach swimmers.

Elsewhere in the state, beach-goers have gotten in trouble with the law for touching - and in one memorable case even riding - manatees.

Florida's Manatee Sanctuary Acts reads: 'It is unlawful for any person at any time, by any means, or in any manner intentionally or negligently to annoy, molest, harass, or disturb or attempt to molest, harass, or disturb any manatee.'

In February 2012, Ryan Waterman, of Fort Pierce, was arrested for hugging a manatee and allowing two children to sit on the animal, and then posting photos of his encounter with the creature on Facebook.

Later that year, Ana Gloria Garcia Gutierrez was taken into custody after being photographed riding a sea cow in Pinellas.
