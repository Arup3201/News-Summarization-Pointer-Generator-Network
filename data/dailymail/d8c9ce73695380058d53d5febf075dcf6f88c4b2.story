Paul Gascoigne has told how a DVD message from Sir Alex Ferguson helped save his life during his five-week stay in a U.S. rehab clinic.

The 45-year-old former England player said he watched the Manchester United manager and family and friends make emotional appeals for him to battle his demons.

Gascoigne said: 'I was blown away watching people like Sir Alex telling me to stay strong and pull through.

Star support: Other well-wishers on the video included striker Wayne Rooney, Lord Alan Sugar, Match of the Day host Gary Lineker and England manager Roy Hodgson

'Sir Alex reminded me I'm a fighter. 
He said he was speaking on behalf of all the United players and everyone
was rooting for me,' he told The Sun.

Gascoigne said striker Wayne Rooney, Lord Alan Sugar, Match of the Day host Gary Lineker and England manager Roy Hodgson also appeared on the DVD along with members of his family.

Gascoigne returned home to Bournemouth
on Saturday following treatment for alcoholism at the £7,500-a-week 
Cottonwood clinic in Arizona.

He spent three days in a coma after an
adverse reaction to detoxification and said doctors spent two weeks 
trying to save his life.

Gascoigne gave special praise and thanks on friends DJ Chris Evans and ex-cricketer Ronnie Irani for organising the finances to pay for his treatment.

Hundreds of thousands of pounds were raised within just days to meet the £7,500-a-week clinic fees. Footballers including Arsenal's Jack Wilshere and Liverpool's Steven Gerrard put their hands in their pockets to help the stricken star.

‘I remember waking up – and they had 
strapped my ankles and knees, my body, my chest, and tied my hands to 
the bed,’ he said. ‘I knew I had been in a bad way but  I didn’t realise
it was that bad – I really didn’t.

‘The medics who have spent their 
careers treating alcoholics said my detox was the worst they had ever 
seen. I had been pumped with more drugs than any other patient.

‘Three doctors didn’t think I would make it.’

He added: ‘It has got to inspire me 
never to let this happen again. I’m excited because I was  ****ing dead 
two weeks ago. I’ve come through that – death. I was dead.’

Drinking: Gascoigne supped a pint of beer after landing at Phoenix airport on his way to rehab last month

The former Newcastle midfielder, who has fought a high-profile battle with alcohol addiction, retired from football in 2004.

Last month he made a drunken 
appearance at a charity event where he slurred his words and sobbed in 
front of fans. He was reported to be drinking two litres of gin and 15 
cans of lager a day.

Friends including Piers Morgan and 
Chris Evans helped fund the star’s treatment. But he was spotted 
drinking lager in a bar shortly after stepping off the plane.

Rehab: Gazza was treated in a clinic in Arizona for a month

Gascoigne, a father of two, said he 
was ‘constantly injected’ around the heart and lungs during his two 
weeks in intensive care.

‘The doctor said it was unbelievable –
the worst detox he had ever seen. It made me scared just listening. The
doctor said he was surprised if I would make it through,’ he said.

‘I thought I was on my way out. I 
looked like a corpse. I was a total wreck. I’ve had quite a few chances 
in my life, but I’m so grateful to  be alive.’

He added: ‘I can’t keep saying sorry 
to people for letting everyone down again. Actions speak louder than 
words. I will prove to people how it is going to be different this time.

‘I should be dead. The doctors said I would not make it. But I’m here, I have another chance – and I’m  going to take it.’
