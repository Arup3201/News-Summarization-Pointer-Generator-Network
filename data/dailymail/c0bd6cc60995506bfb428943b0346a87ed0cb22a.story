A Wall Street investor accused of insider trading over half a million dollars bolted from the press pack waiting for him outside court in New York today, sprinting so fast he left one of his flip flops on the sidewalk.

Michael Lucarelli was arrested Tuesday morning at his apartment on the Upper East Side and immediately faced Manhattan Federal Courthouse.

The 51-year-old director of market intelligence at Lippert/Heilshorn & Associates allegedly used non-public information from draft press releases to cash in on the stock market.

He has been hit with with 13 counts of security fraud charges, according to The New York Daily News.

After noticing photographers, he put his hands up over his face and started to run.

And he after losing one of his shoes, he kept on going, leaving the Brown sandal on Worth St.

Lippert/Heilshorn founding partner Keith Lippert described Lucarelli as a 'rogue employee' and 'selfish' following his arrest.

'It’s very disconcerting, when you run a company for 30 years that prides itself on its honesty and integrity, and of its employees in dealing with clients’ non-public information, to have to deal with a rogue employee who, despite the firewalls in place and the rules and regulations, obviously completely ignored it for his own selfish gain,' Lippert told The New York Business Journal.

Lucarelli, who was hired by the firm in August 2012, is facing 20 years prison and up to $1 million in fines.

The 13 charges date back to August 2013.

'Despite the well-known parade of convicted insider trading perpetrators over the past several years, Michael Lucarelli was not deterred and violated both his company's policies and his responsibility to its clients,' U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a release.

George Venizelos, head of the New York FBI office, said that rather than doing his job, Lucarelli 'spent his days setting up brokerage accounts to make illegal trades using inside information from unwitting clients'.

Prosecutors allege Lucarelli stole draft press releases that could influence investors once the information became public.

He would then allegedly buy stock from his clients, and sell them when the information became available, earning him over $500,000.

In one of the sales, Lucarelli allegedly made a $90,000 profit, according to The Biz Journal.

Lucarelli allegedly used four different brokerage accounts to funnel the money into.

The finance website said the FBI first searched Lucarelli's office on July 24 and allegedly found a locked briefcase with one of the draft press released inside.

Authorities notified LHA bosses of the impending two days before Lucarelli's arrest, however they refrained from terminating so as to not hinder the investigation.
