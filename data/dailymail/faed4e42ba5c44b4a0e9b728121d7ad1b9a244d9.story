A badly decomposed body has been found wrapped up in a roll of carpet by a workman at a derelict house.

Christopher Metcalfe discovered the remains while cleaning out the burned out building in Whitby on Saturday afternoon.

Mr Metcalfe said he and a fellow worker were shocked by the state of the body, which police said appeared to have been at the property in the residential street for some time.

Killer: Police said they do not believe the body could be linked to double murderer James Allen, pictured. He killed charity worker Julie Davison in her flat about 400 metres from where the body was found

Mr Metcalfe said: 'I still can't believe it has happened, I can't get it out my head thinking of what could have happened.'

Police were called to the property at 2pm on Saturday and initially described the man's death as 'unexplained'.

North Yorkshire Police then said they did not believe the body - which was found in Broomfield Terrace -Â  could be linked to double murderer James Allen, of Middlesbrough.

Last April, after murdering pensioner Colin Dunford in Middlesbrough, Allen killed charity worker and epileptic Julie Davison in her Church Square flat, about 400 metres from where the man's body was found at the weekend.

As a post-mortem examination was under way, a police spokesman said: 'Police enquiries have shown that it is believed to be the body of a local man.

'There is nothing to suggest that there are any suspicious circumstances at this time and a file is being prepared on behalf of the coroner.

'We are not expecting to be in a position to release his identity for some time.'
