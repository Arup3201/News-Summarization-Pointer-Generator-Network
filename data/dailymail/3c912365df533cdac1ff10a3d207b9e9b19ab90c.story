Police fear a mounting number of thrill-seekers are risking death by copying videos of trained climbers and swinging from enormous cliffs.

The dangerous stunt, known as rope swinging, sees typically young people attaching a rope to their feet before plummeting off the edge and swinging across the cliff face.

While accessing the spot is illegal, police say daredevils are deliberately climbing over barriers in order to access the cliff.

Authorities visited a cliff known as The Fear in Manly looking for anchor points on Wednesday, but all they found was a rope attached to a rock, reports Manly Daily.

Police say it is the amateur copycats of professional climbers that are the real concern

Videos are surfacing on social media of experienced climbers taking the plunge, but police say it is the amateur copycats that are the real concern. 

While accessing the spot is illegal, police say the thrill-seekers are deliberately climbing over fences and barriers in order to access the cliff. 

Superintendent Dave Darcy 'people seeing that on social media, especially young males, will think it's achievable but won't have the expertise, knowledge or specific equipment,' Supt Darcy said.

'When these activities go wrong, and inevitably they will, it is members of the emergency services who have to attend and investigate the full circumstances,' he said.

'Sadly the recent death of a man who fell and died at the location appears to have done nothing to deter this type of risk-taking activity,' Supt Darcy said.

Superintendent Dave Darcy said the tragic death of Gareth Jones has failed to deter the rope-swinging trend

Those caught can can receive an on the spot fine of $300

Videos on social media show dare devils diving off the cliff where 25-year-old British man Gareth Jones plunged to his death after posting a photograph of his legs dangling over the rock face.

On his Instagram page he posted the photo with the caption: 'Another day another happy place'.

A spokesperson for NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service said 'These guys are deliberately doing something dangerous and illegal. They are deliberately climbing over fences and barriers and regulating that 24/7 is impossible.'

Those caught can can receive an on the spot fine of $300.
