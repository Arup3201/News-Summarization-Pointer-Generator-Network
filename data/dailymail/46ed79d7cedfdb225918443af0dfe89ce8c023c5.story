Richard Pease, 50, was jailed for eight months for being in charge of a hovercraft while drunk 

A hovercraft pilot has been jailed today for being in charge of his passenger vessel while drunk, causing it to have near misses with a tanker and a busy pier.

Richard Pease, of Cowes, Isle of Wight, pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to a charge of being master of a hovercraft having consumed excess alcohol under the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003.

The court heard Pease collapsed at the controls as he failed to steer the craft on to its landing pad at Ryde.

Sunyana Sharma, prosecuting, told Isle of Wight Crown Court that the 50-year-old gave a breath test six hours after the incident on June 22 this year which gave a reading of 96mg of alcohol in 100 ml of breath - the drink-drive limit is 35mg.

The defendant, who has 18 years' experience as a hovercraft pilot, told police that he had been drinking from a bottle which he had not realised contained alcohol in a bid to keep cool and hydrated during two journeys which carried a total of more than 130 people.

But the court heard the defendant accepted that once he realised the bottle contained alcohol, he continued to drink from it. 

Sentencing Pease, Judge Susan Evans QC said: 'It's tragic that someone of your standing and with such an impressive past career should have destroyed all of that in one day.

'It was an appalling breach of your duty. You put yourself in a condition where you were unable to discharge your duty as pilot of a hovercraft and your responsibilities to your passengers, the crew and the other users of the Solent.

'Your actions could have resulted in tragedy but fortunately they did not.'

Miss Sharma described how Pease had driven the Hovertravel craft Freedom 90 from Ryde to Southsea, Hampshire, with 95 passengers on board when it failed to reach the landing pad.

He then piloted the same craft back across the Solent with 36 passengers on board when his assistant, handling agent John Randles, realised Pease had slowed down in the path of a tanker heading towards Southampton.

Mr Sharma said: 'What is normal procedure, if safe to do so, the hovercraft will cross in front of of the tanker and not reduce the speed.

'It was noted the defendant did reduce his speed when coming across the front of the tanker, as a result of that observation, he (Mr Randles) asked the defendant if he had noticed the tanker to which he replied 'Yes'.

'At that point the defendant increased his speed and he averted a potential incident.'

Miss Sharma then described how Pease started to lose control of the craft as it arrived at Ryde, missing the landing pad and headed towards Ryde Pier. 

She said that Pease collapsed at the controls and Mr Randles had to take urgent action to take control of the craft. Miss Sharma said:

'As he was making the approach he failed to take the normal position on the landing pad so the craft would be landed safely.

'Ryde Pier is a traditional wooden pier, it carries a passenger train and vehicles and during summer it's very, very busy.

'As the landing was being made, Mr Randles asked the defendant if he was OK, to which the defendant replied that he was.

'The handling agent pointed out to the defendant he wasn't in line with pad as he was supposed to be. The defendant slightly adjusted the control but as he went to take control of the throttle, it appeared his hand slipped, he missed the control and he went to reach for it again.

'Unfortunately the adjustment made wasn't enough and the hovercraft was heading towards the pier rather than towards the pad.

Hovertravel provides the fastest way to cross the Solent with a journey of less than 10 minutes.

The company operates two hovercrafts and has carried more than 26 million passengers since it opened in 1965.

Hovertravel is the world's longest-running commercial hovercraft service and is the only scheduled passenger service in Europe. 

Modern hovercraft were developed in the 1950s by British inventor Sir Christopher Cockerell.

They float on a cushion of air allowing them to travel over water and flat land surfaces.

The steering of the craft is controlled by rudders, which are located in the slipstream behind each propeller. 

The captain can also use the propellers to change the direction of the craft. 

'Once again the defendant was asked if he was ok, at that point there was no positive response.

'Upon a further question being asked, it was noticed the defendant had drooped and he had gone limp in the chair.

'As there was no response from the defendant, Mr Randles took immediate action and taking control of the hovercraft he landed it safely.'

The court was shown CCTV footage showing the hovercraft weaving as it arrived at Ryde and coming to a halt as it headed in the wrong direction away from the landing pad and towards Ryde Pier.

The court was told it was at this point that Mr Randles took over the controls and brought it to safety before another pilot came on board to bring it to the landing pad.

Pease was taken to hospital by paramedics who noticed his speech was slurred and he was having 'alcohol sweats' and six hours after the crossing, he gave the positive breath test.

Judge Evans said: 'Common sense says he didn't drink anything in the hospital and he must have been significantly more affected when he left the craft.'

Describing Pease's actions as a 'grave dereliction of duty', Miss Sharma added: 'It's perhaps fortunate there was no serious injury or death from this incident.'

Neil Fitzgibben, defending, said that Pease, a married father of two teenage sons, was of impeccable character and with 14,000 hours in charge of a hovercraft, he was Hovertravel's most experienced pilot.

He described how his client had been operating the hovercraft that day in hot conditions in the cabin and had felt unwell and dehydrated.

In his lunch break at the pilots' mess in Ryde, he had found an opened bottle of water and had poured orange squash into it to drink when he went back on board to keep himself hydrated, Mr Fitzgibben said.

He continued: 'The bottle is in the pilot's mess, it's not unusual for bottles and lost property to make its way into the pilots' mess room. He took the bottle on board.

'The Isle of Wight Festival had only finished a week previously, how it found its way into the mess is not known.

'He was consuming something he didn't know what it was, he should have been aware of what had been consumed.

'Mr Pease is as shocked and surprised as anyone that he was over the limit and secondly by so much.' 

He added: 'He had in the past sought help for dependency on alcohol when he was a much younger man in the Merchant Navy but I understand he had come to terms with that many years ago.'

Mr Fitzgibben continued: 'The effect of what happened that day has brought about a severe bout of depression. He is a man consumed with remorse for what happened.'

After the hearing, Miss Sharma confirmed that the sentence did not prohibit him from getting behind the wheel of a car.

A Hovertravel spokesman said:'Throughout the court proceedings Hovertravel has co-operated fully with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's investigation.

'Following sentencing today, we can now conclude our own investigation.

'Hovertravel is fully committed to the health and safety of passengers and staff, with a comprehensive set of robust policies and a zero tolerance to alcohol and drugs all endorsed by the MCA.' 

Neil Cunningham, Maritime and Coastguard Agency Enforcement Officer, said: 'The master of any vessel has a duty of care to their crew and passengers, so to carry out this responsibility whilst under the influence of alcohol is totally irresponsible. 

'Mr Pease was clearly not in any fit state to carry out his duties safely. It is incredibly fortunate that no-one was hurt in this case.

'I would like to take this opportunity to praise the quick thinking of a crew member on board the Hovercraft Freedom 90 for safely bringing the craft to a stop in Ryde and also to thank Hovertravel for its cooperation and assistance throughout this investigation.'
