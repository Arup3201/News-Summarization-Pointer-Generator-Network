Accused: Retired LAPD detective Dan DeJarnette

A retired detective from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has been arrested in Hawaii over the death of his wife six years ago.

Dan DeJarnette pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder during his arraignment yesterday, according to a Hawaii County prosecutor.

DeJarnette was taken into custody on Monday evening after being arrested at his home on Hawaii's Big Island in connection with his wife Yu's death, the Los Angeles Times reports.

The former detective said, at the time of his wife's death in 2006, that he had woken and found her lying on a lava embankment about 20 feet from the couple's home.

She had suffered a severe head injury and was pronounced dead at hospital.

DeJarnette was booked at the time for investigation of murder but was later released due to a of lack of evidence.

The arrest comes after the authorities reopened the case in January.

DeJarnette joined the LAPD in 1982, the Los Angeles Times reported, working as a homicide detective and investigating rape cases.

After retiring from the police force in 2003, he moved to Hawaii's Big Island.
