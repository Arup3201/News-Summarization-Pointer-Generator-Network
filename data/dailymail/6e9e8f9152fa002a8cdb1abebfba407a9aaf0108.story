Maybe they smoked too much of their own product? 

Two marijuana traffickers were arrested after they dialed 911 and admitted to possessing 20 pounds of marijuana because they believed they had been discovered by undercover cops - but officers said they didn't have a clue.

Idaho police found Leland Ryan Kaimipono Ayala-Doliente, 21, and Craig Sward Holland, 22, standing outside their car with a dog cage containing $16,000 worth of pot,  according to the Idaho State Journal.

Police had no idea the paranoid pair were transporting weed across the state. Officers found them outside their car holding a dog cage filled with $16,000 worth of pot filled in 20 one pound bags (pictured) 

The weed was stuffed in 20 small one-pound bags.  

Ayala-Doliente and Holland had already been reported by a passerby earlier that evening for acting suspiciously in their parked car.

But officers had no idea they were transporting cannabis through the state until the paranoid pair made their fateful 911 call. 

Police Capt. Randy Lewis said the suspects believed they were being followed. 

Ayala-Doliente and Holland were transporting the marijuana from California to Montana. 

They have been charged with drug trafficking and are currently in custody in Madison County Jail.
