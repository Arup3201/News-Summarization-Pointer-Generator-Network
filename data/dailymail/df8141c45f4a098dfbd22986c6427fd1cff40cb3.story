Three months into his new life in Rome and the most memorable contribution from Ashley Cole remains that peculiar pose on the fringes of a group photograph.

It proved an internet hit and Cole took the jokes in good spirit but the snapshot seems to have captured accurately a footballer with peripheral role in the squad, unable to mix with his new colleagues as he gets to grips with the language.

The former Chelsea and Arsenal defender is slowly learning some Italian, but it is a new trick for a 33-year-old and he is naturally more comfortable in the company of Roma team-mates who speak good English such as Daniele de Rossi, Miralem Pjanic and Kevin Strootman.

The 33-year-old has played four league games for Roma since joining the club on a free transfer

On the pitch, he has not dazzled. Reporters who cover the Giallorosso have rated him with fives and sixes in his opening games and compared him unfavourably to Maicon, who arrived 12 months earlier at the age of 32 and, after initial concerns, proved to be an inspired acquisition.

Ashley Cole's appearances for Roma so far:

Roma 2-0 Hellas Verona 

Roma 2-0 Cagliari

Empoli 0-1 Roma

Roma 2-0 Fiorentina

For Roma, however, the season could not have started better. The Giallorosso have won their first six in all competitions. They trail champions Juventus at the top of Serie A only on goal difference and smashed five past CSKA Moscow in their Champions League opener.

Cole was left out against CSKA, as versatile Greek Vasilis Torosidis, who normally plays on the right, was switched to left back to mark Zoran Tosic.

Former Premier League star Cole was also an unused substitute for the game against Parma, but has since returned to the team and played 90 minutes at the weekend in the win against Verona. 

'Team work makes the dream work,' tweeted Cole, after helping Roma make it 15 points from five games in Serie A. If there is one thing he really does know about it is winning. Thirteen major trophies in England tells you that.

Boss Rudi Garcia is convinced the Londoner will adjust to Italian football. The tempo is slower than the Premier League, which should offset his age (Francesco Totti is still starring at 38), and Cole has more Champions League experience than any other player in the Roma squad.

When asked how he has fit in, Garcia has said Cole is 'quiet' and 'polite' and working hard, determined to make the move a success. A career in Rome is not built in a day, after all.

Cole’s attitude to training has never been questioned, even if he has annoyed managers like Carlo Ancelotti and Jose Mourinho at times with his fondness for night-life. He has yet to find his way into Italy’s gossip columns.

Among team-mates, he has always been popular and it has been quite some time since he was an eye-catching, flying full back.

In his Chelsea years, he was more of a solid and reliable performer, low on errors, leaning on his nous and ability to read the game while rarely doing anything flash (at least not on the pitch) and never letting his team-mates down.

Occasionally he would produce a barely-believable clearance as a reminder of his individual quality.

This is what made him the best English left back of his generation and earned him more than 100 international caps. It is a little surprising, therefore, that the Italian media have been unimpressed with his defensive acumen, while satisfied with his ability to get forward and deliver a cross.

NOVEMBER 2012: Chelsea 0-0 Manchester City (Premier League) D

MARCH 2012: Manchester City 2-1 Chelsea (Premier League) L

DECEMBER 2011: Chelsea 2-1 Manchester City (Premier League) W

Cole knows how to defend. This is something he will crack when he understands the details of Italian football and can communicate more effectively.

His mature defensive profile fits with the traditional image of a full back in the Italian game. They are in the team primarily to defend, although modern coaches demand a little more mileage and creative input from their full backs.

Cole’s advancing years – he will be 34 in December - and his battle-scarred ankles may be limiting his involvement.

It certainly seemed that way during his final months at Chelsea, when he lost his place to Cesar Azpilicueta.

But, even last season, when he did not have the advantage of regular football, he summoned memorable performances as Chelsea kept a clean sheet at Atletico Madrid and England did the same in Ukraine.

He ought to be at his best in games when Roma are tested defensively. In that sense, the game at City will be a more accurate barometer on the direction of his form since leaving Chelsea, or on Sunday in Turin, when Roma face title rivals Juventus.

Perhaps this is the week when Cole discovers if he will ever be anything other than a peripheral figure in the Eternal City.
