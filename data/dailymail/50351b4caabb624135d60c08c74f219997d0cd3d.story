As the real referees are welcomed back to the NFL with open arms, one of the dismissed replacements has admitted that they may not have been ready for the job.

Jerry Frump, a banker from Chicago who has worked in college football for three decades, was one of the most experienced of the replacements.

But during an interview published on Friday, Mr Frump questioned the experience of his colleagues as they jumped up from various levels of college football.

Making the call: With his 30 years in college football Jerry Frump was one of the more experienced replacement referees who took the field during the lockout

When asked by Time magazine if his crew was ready to be officiating at NFL games, Frump said: 'No, I don't think you could say that.'

As for moments like the hotly disputed call that had one referee calling touchdown and another calling interception last Monday night, Mr Frump said the NFL was getting what it paid for.

He told the magazine: 'We were pawns. This really became a business deal… This was [the NFL's] choice. They chose to take this position in the negotiation with the union.'

But despite his lack of NFL experience, Mr Frump accepted what he believed to be the chance of a lifetime.

He told Time: 'If I hadn't done it, somebody else would have. We did the best we could.'

The league's referees took the field on Thursday night to a standing ovation from fans after the labor dispute was resolved.

Also last week, the NFL replacement ref who signaled a touchdown on the final play of Monday night's Packers-Seahawks game said he stands by his controversial decision which allowed the Seahawks to win 14-12.

Lance Easley, a banker from California whose controversial decision is believed to be the event that sparked the resolution, is adamant he made the correct call.

'I don’t appreciate the negative stuff,' said Easley, who feels that he’s had to shoulder the blame for Monday night's decision.

Scapegoat: Lance Easley claims that he didn't do anything wrong

'I didn't do anything wrong,' Easley told TMZ. 'Put any other official who knows the rules and they would make the same call.'

Easley said the Packers player who allegedly intercepted the ball never had singular possession because, 'You have to not only have the ball but have either two feet or a body part on the ground, and that never happened.'

Although the NFL rulebook cites simultaneous possession is awarded to the passing team, Packers cornerback M.D. Jennings clearly came away with the ball prior to Seahawks wide receiver Golden Tate, who stripped the ball away as he was tangled with Jennings.

Easley, who normally refs at El Camino and Pierce Junior Colleges as well as Occidental, all in Southern California, said the replacement refs did what they were expected to do.

'We did a damn good job... for the most part.'

His controversial call followed months of an intense labor lockout between the NFL and NFLRA, who finally came to an eight-year agreement on Thursday morning.

The stalemate, which saw the NFL's referees locked out since the beginning for the pre-season, had been whittled down to disagreements over 'a little money.'

The real refs returned to the field to officiate Thursday night's game between the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Ravens.

Referee Gene Steratore and his seven-man crew received a standing ovation as they walked on the field in their familiar stripes for the first game of Week 4.

One fan held up a sign that read: 'Finally! We get to yell at real refs! Welcome back!'

'The other refs just made dumb calls,' said Jessie Riley, a 15-year-old fan wearing an Ed Reed jersey. 'I couldn't stand them. Now we won't get robbed; everything will be fair - hopefully.'

The officials ran a mostly smooth and efficient first game back, with no headline-making calls as the Ravens beat the Browns 23-16.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged that Monday night’s disputed touchdown 'may have pushed the parties further along' in the talks.

'Obviously when you go through something like this it is painful for everybody,' Goodell said. 'Most importantly, it is painful for our fans. We are sorry to have to put our fans through that, but it is something that in the short term you sometimes have to do to make sure you get the right kind of deal for the long term and make sure you continue to grow the game.'

The deal is only tentative - it must be ratified by 51 percent of the union's 121 members in a vote scheduled for Friday and Saturday in Dallas.

The lockout ended after marathon negotiations produced an eight-year agreement to end the lockout that began in June. However, for the Packers, Redskins, Lions and other teams who voiced their displeasure with calls that might have swayed games, the agreement doesn't change their records.

The commissioner said he watched Monday night's frenetic Packers-Seahawks finish at home.

'You never want to see a game end like that,' he said.

The new agreement will improve officiating in the future, Goodell asserted, reducing mistakes like those made Monday and making the strains of the last three weeks worthwhile.

Goodell acknowledged 'you're always worried' about the perception of the league.

'Obviously, this has gotten a lot of attention,' he said. 'It hasn't been positive, and it's something that you have to fight through and get to the long term. ... We always are going to have to work harder to make sure we get people's trust and confidence in us.'

The dispute even made its way to the campaign trail, with President Barack Obama's spokesman, Jay Carney, calling Thursday 'a great day for America.'

'The president's very pleased that the two sides have come together,' Carney said.
