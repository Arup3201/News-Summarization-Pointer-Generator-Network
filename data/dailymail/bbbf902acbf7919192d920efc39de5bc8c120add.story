Prince Harry might have spent the past few days twerking with a bevy of beauties in Memphis, but as these photos reveal, the bank holiday weekend has been far from enjoyable for his former girlfriend, Cressida Bonas.

Looking pale and thin, Ms Bonas cut a sombre figure as she strode through London's Notting Hill, her eyes hidden behind sunglasses and her long, blonde hair swinging loose.

Although reports over the weekend suggested the former couple are still in love and may reunite,  Prince Harry's antics at the Memphis Polo Club are unlikely to have pleased the 25-year-old.

Ms Bonas was originally expected to attend the wedding, but it is thought the couple separated after arguing about the trip.

The
 25-year-old was spotted last week pacing the streets outside the office
 in the West End where she has a job in marketing, biting her nails and 
with tears in her eyes.

She has also reportedly been given compassionate leave from work to consider her future and has cut an increasingly wan figure as the separation continues.

By contrast, her erstwhile beau appears to have been having the time of his life in Memphis, where his best friend Guy Pelly married American socialite, Lizzy Wilson on Saturday.

The prince, who was seen ‘twerking’ on the dance floor, was having such a good time at the ‘unbelievably wild’ party that he made the band play five encores as he kept the party going beyond the 1am finish time.

And while his brother dominated the dancefloor, it was William who jumped on the stage singing the Isley Brothers’ Shout.

Jimmy Church, whose Motown band provided the entertainment, told the Daily Mail: ‘It was a great night, it was unbelievably wild.

‘Prince William was in front of the stage moving to the music, and then all of a sudden it got to him and he got up on the stage and was singing and dancing. He was getting down and I was getting down.’

'Mr Church said there were a number of women who tried to get close to Harry. He added: ‘Harry was dancing with the ladies. There were just so many, he was surrounded.

‘There were so many packed in around him you couldn’t tell if he was with one girl or 20 girls.

‘You think of royalty as being stuffy, but they were loose. At the end when we finished Harry came up to the stage and asked if we would play another song as he did not want the night to end. We ended up doing five encores.’

Mr Church said guests began crowd surfing as his band played: ‘I’ve been doing this 50 years and I ain’t ever seen anything like this. These guys know how to party.’

He added: ‘William came up to me and gave me a hug and said that he wants me to come to London. It was the highlight of my life.’

The wedding came at the end of three days of celebrations that included a visit to Graceland, Elvis Presley’s mansion.

On Thursday night after arriving in town, the guests enjoyed ribs at a barbecue restaurant before some, including Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, partied into the night on Beale Street, the city’s iconic main strip.

Before arriving in Memphis, Harry stopped off in Miami where he was seen dancing in a nightclub into the early hours.

Cressida, meanwhile, remained at home alone.
