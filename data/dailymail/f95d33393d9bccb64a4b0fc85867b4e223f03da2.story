He
 was supported by both his mother Debbie and boyfriend Dustin Lance 
Black, who were pictured in the stands holding up an England flag reading 'Daley'.

Black,
 40, looked nervous and clutched his hand to his chest as he 
watched his partner perform, but started cheering and applauding as Daley successfully 
completed the dives.

Daley's
 margin of victory was a whopping 82.85 as Malaysia's Ooi Tze Liang 
finished second on 433.70, while Canada's Vincent Riendeau was third with

Australia's Matthew 
Mitcham, the 2008 Olympic champion and silver medallist 
behind Daley four years ago, finished fourth with 420.00.

Daley's win took England's tally from 10 events to 10 medals, four of them gold.

Tonight, the diver said he was 
thrilled with his performance, saying: 'It's 
always tough to go into a competition when you're ahead because when 
you're ahead you've got to make sure you keep your standard up. If you 
slip, someone's going to catch you.

'I
 just had to keep imagining that someone was right on my heels to make 
me step it up. I don't want to go out there and just do average diving. I
 want to do perfect diving.'

He also 
emphatically dismissed rumours that he might retire following his win, 
saying he planned to pursue gold at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016.

Daley a London 2012 bronze medallist, said of his Olympic aim: 'Of course. I don't quite know where that rumour came from.

'I
 came back from (the World Cup event in) Shanghai and all of a sudden I 
saw that I was retiring after the Commonwealths. I was like - "news to 
me".'

Now, Daley has set his sights on taking on the world's best.

Worried: Black, 40, looked nervous as he watched his partner perform at the Royal Commonwealth Pool

'There's
 every possibility that I can mix it with the Chinese now,' he said. 'I 
wouldn't mind if I never beat the Chinese until 2016. You've only got to
 do it once and you've got to do it when it counts.

'Hopefully they'll be able to see that I'm coming to get them.'

Hannah Starling earlier claimed bronze in the women's three-metres springboard.
