Ice cream magnate and State Treasurer Doug Ducey has won the Republican primary to stand for the next governor of Arizona, one of four states where voters were choosing candidates for statewide office.

Ducey, who started Cold Stone Creamery in Arizona and built it into a national brand before selling the company in 2007, won the primary following a campaign focusing on his blend of government and business experience.

He has been state treasurer for the last four years, serving as the chief steward of Arizona's finances during a period that included the collapse of the housing market in the state.

The race to replace Republican Governor Jan Brewer had started as a fairly quiet contest focused on health care and jobs.

It shifted abruptly however when thousands of immigrant children began entering the country, with some settling in Arizona.

The six candidates soon staked out hard-line positions on immigration in the quest for right-leaning Republican primary voters, repeatedly attacking the Obama administration for failing to secure the 
border.

Democrat Fred DuVal was unopposed in his primary and will face Ducey in November.

Elsewhere, former Republican Governor Charlie Crist contined his political comeback as Democratic voters selected him as their nominee to challenge Republican Gov. Rick Scott in Florida.

Crist easily defeated former state Sen. Nan Rich, while Scott coasted in his own primary toward a general election matching the state's last two Republican governors.

Both have struggled with sagging approval ratings and run-ins with conservatives.

'It's a wonderful night,' Crist declared after accepting a concession call from Rich.

Crist said the strong showing is a sign that Democrats believe in him. 'Frankly, I think I was on their side when I was in the other party,' he said as he prepared a victory speech. He said a friend once told him, '"Charlie, you've been a Democrat your whole life, you just didn't know it." Well, now I know it.'

Vermont Republicans nominated businessman Scott Milne over three other candidates to face Democratic incumbent Peter Shumlin, who also leads the Democratic Governors Association. Other statewide offices, including an at-large House seat, also are on the ballot.

Oklahoma Democrats chose state Sen. Connie Johnson as their Senate nominee over perennial candidate Jim Rogers. Johnson will be a general election underdog against Rep. James Lankford for the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Tom Coburn.
