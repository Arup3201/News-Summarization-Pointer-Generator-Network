Victorino Chua, 49, from Stockport, is said to have poisoned 21 patients 'completely at random' by lacing drips with insulin 

A male nurse murdered three patients by putting poison in saline drips and leaving them as ‘ticking timebombs’ for other medics to administer, a court heard yesterday.

Victorino Chua is said to have poisoned 21 people ‘completely at random’ by lacing the drips with insulin then waiting for other nurses and doctors to unwittingly give them to patients.

One of the survivors was left with a serious brain injury.

Eventually, a pattern began to emerge and Chua, 49, was ‘the common denominator’ in all the cases, the court heard.

Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said it was a ‘lottery’ which patients were harmed because the drips were unknowingly administered by others.

‘In the vast majority of cases, the poisoner seems to have contaminated products completely at random,’ he told the court.

As the victims became critically ill, Chua is said to have covered up his ‘handiwork’ by falsely recording that they were fine.

In one case, he claimed a victim was ‘comfortable’ when in reality he was close to death after being poisoned with insulin, a jury was told.

Mr Wright said Chua’s motive was hard to determine with precision, adding that ‘only the person responsible could ever know why they would embark on such conduct’.

He said the nurse had ‘turned from a man who had dedicated his life to caring for others, to harming them’.

Filipino-born Chua faces 36 charges over an alleged poisoning campaign that spread panic through a busy NHS hospital between the summer of 2011 and January 2012.

They include the murders of Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Derek Weaver, 83, none of whom recovered after allegedly being poisoned with insulin.

Chua is also accused of altering drug dosages, in one case putting an 86-year-old’s life at risk by changing her prescription chart after arguing with her daughter about her care.

The jury heard he upped the amount of medication meant for Maria Pawlyszyn after her daughter demanded she be put on a heart monitor.

The married father of two, who came to Britain in 2002, worked on two wards at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport.

A number of its patients were found to have unexplained low blood sugar over a three-week period, his trial at Manchester Crown Court was told.

Staff initially assumed a batch of saline used for administering medication and flushing out cannulas had accidentally become contaminated with insulin, the court heard.

But police were called when it became clear a poisoner may have been at work.

Tracey Arden, 44 and Arnold Lancaster, 71, died at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport in 2011. Chua is accused of their murders 

Interviewed as a potential witness, Chua expressed concern that the room in which medication was stored was not kept locked, Mr Wright said.

He added that the nurse’s shifts fitted the pattern of unexpected hypoglaecemic episodes suffered by 21 patients on wards A1 and A3 in June and July 2011.

Prosecutors say 83-year-old Alfred Derek Weaver, who also died in 2011, was another of Chua's victims

The jury heard Chua recorded that Grant Misell, 41, was doing fine even though he was dangerously ill and had insulin in his blood. 

The patient was later found to have suffered ‘catastrophic’ brain damage.

‘If it wasn’t Victorino Chua who poisoned Grant Misell, who was it?’ asked Mr Wright.

He said Chua had tampered with saline products before, leaving them ‘like a ticking timebomb’ for nurses on the next shift.

Mr Wright said the incidents stopped after the hospital imposed tougher security measures that ‘restricted the opportunity for the poisoner’.

Instead, he said, Chua took ‘a different approach’.

In January 2012, nurses realised their prescription charts had been ‘crudely’ altered to increase the dosages or frequency.

In one case, 5mg had been tripled to 15mg.

In some cases, including Mrs Pawlyszyn’s, Mr Wright said the consequences could have been fatal. Fortunately, the ‘forgery’ was discovered before she was given the increased dose, and the only patient who did receive extra medication made a full recovery.

Mr Wright said the idea that the insulin contamination and the prescription alterations were the work of two different poisoners was ‘so improbable as to be capable of being discounted’.

‘Mr Chua had the means and the knowhow,’ he told the jury

‘He also had the opportunity. So, it may be said, had many others. We say... the conclusion you are driven to reach is that the person responsible for each of these matters is the defendant.’ 

Chua had been working at Stepping Hill since 2009 when the deaths occurred. The court was told it was 'a lottery' which patients were harmed by the contaminated bags 

He told the jury of 10 men and two women: 'The pieces of the forensic jigsaw began to emerge.

'The person responsible for each of these matters became increasingly clear. It was, we say, Victorino Chua.

'As the investigation intensified, the common denominator, the defendant, was shown in sharper and sharper relief.

Insulin is produced naturally by the body to regulate blood sugar levels, and various forms are widely available in hospitals for treating patients, including those with diabetes, the jury was told.

But minuscule amounts deliberately used to contaminate medication, or products such as saline used in drips and other procedures, can prove fatal, prosecutor Peter Wright QC, told the jury. In an otherwise healthy patient, it causes levels of glucose in the blood to drop sharply within a matter of minutes.

Symptoms include a pale, sweaty appearance, but prompt treatment with sugars usually results in a full recovery.

However, if it is not detected in time, patients suffer convulsions and eventually slip into a coma, potentially resulting in brain damage and ultimately death.

'Motive for this course of conduct, whomsoever is responsible, is difficult to determine with precision.

'Only the person responsible could ever know why they would embark on such conduct.'  

Chua was arrested on January 5 2012 and denied any wrongdoing.

The nurse, who is married with two children, was born in the Philippines and left school at the age of 17, before graduating with a nursing degree in Manila in 1989, where he worked in the 1990s.

In February 2002 he came to the UK on a temporary two-year work permit, working in nursing homes.

He became a registered nurse in 2003 and a naturalised UK citizen in 2008. In 2009 he began working as a staff nurse at Stepping Hill.   

Chua, from Stockport, has pleaded not guilty to 36 charges in all, including the three alleged murders.  

The other charges are made up of, one count of grievous bodily harm with intent, 23 counts of attempted grievous bodily harm, eight counts of attempting to cause a poison to be administered and one count of administering a poison.

All of the offences are said to have happened between June 2011 and January 2012.   

The trial continues.

Panic gripped Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport as staff came to suspect a poisoner was leaving ‘ticking timebombs’ on the wards, the jury was told.
