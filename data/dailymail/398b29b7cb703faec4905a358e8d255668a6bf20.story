For a man who has just undergone a spectacular fall from grace, you wouldn’t have expected Chris Huhne to look so chirpy.

Nor would you have expected the shamed former Cabinet minister to be sporting a flash of Lib Dem orange having been forced to resign from his beloved party.

Swapping a sharp suit for a prison-issue jacket, Huhne is pictured here for the first time in the low-security Leyhill Prison in Gloucestershire.

Perhaps it’s no wonder he’s all breezy smiles. The open prison was once dubbed ‘the Savoy of Slammers’ because of its easy-going regime.

The multi-millionaire is at the start of an eight-month sentence for perverting the course of justice when his ex-wife took speeding points for him ten years ago.

As onlookers watched from a public footpath skirting the prison yesterday morning, Huhne, 58, could be seen sauntering around with his hands in his jeans pockets.

After an evidently satisfying breakfast, he strolled back to his accommodation block, chatting to fellow inmates with the same ease he once employed when winning over potential allies in the corridors of the House of Commons.

Huhne’s motoring offence fraud unravelled after he left his economist wife Vicky Pryce, 60, for his aide Carina Trimingham, 45.

Embittered Pryce leaked the story to journalists, and both she and her husband have ended up inside – with both being moved to open prisons within weeks of being sentenced on March 11.

Huhne and Pryce are no long on speaking terms but the politician’s smile may have been boosted by the visit he received on Saturday from Miss Trimingham. She spent two and a half hours inside the jail before leaving looking grim-faced.
