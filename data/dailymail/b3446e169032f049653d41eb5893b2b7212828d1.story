A ten-year-old schoolgirl had her life saved by a routine eye test which showed a tumour the size of a golf ball pressing against her brain.

Lauren Uncles went to her local opticians to get some prescription sunglasses for a family holiday in Cornwall on August 21.

But during her eye examination, optometrist David Strachan spotted swelling behind her optic nerve.

Lauren Uncles (pictured with her mother Teresa) was diagnosed with a brain tumour after her optician noticed a problem during a routine appointment. Thanks to the optician, she rapidly underwent life-saving surgery

Lauren was rushed from her local Specsavers branch in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, to nearby Queen's Hospital for further tests.

These revealed she had a rare cranial fibroma - a cancer which grows inside the eye - which can be deadly if left untreated and can cause complete blindness within days.

The next day she was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital where she underwent a major operation to remove the benign tumour.

Her mother Teresa, 34, a phone shop sales consultant, urged other parents to make sure their children get their eyes checked regularly.

She said: ‘I took her for an eye test because she was going to go to Cornwall on holiday with her friends.

‘The optometrist told us there was swelling on eye and told us it was best that we went to the hospital to get it checked out.

‘On the Thursday, the day she was set to go to Cornwall, we went to the hospital in the morning and were then taken to the children's ward before she had an MRI.

‘Quite quickly after she had another one and I knew something was wrong. Then they told us the bad news.

‘I was heartbroken and in complete shock, you don't expect news like that, no parent does, I thought it was all a bad dream but it wasn't.

At Queen's Hospital Lauren was diagnosed with a brain tumour so she was transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital for surgery

‘The doctors said the operation could not have gone better but there is still a tumour in her head, it has just been reduced in size.

‘I just want to appeal to all parents to make sure they take their children for an eye test.

‘What happened to Lauren shows that this can be the difference between life and death.’

Despite her life-saving operation, Lauren acted as if ‘nothing had happened’ and was back eating chips and ice cream within half hour.

Mother-of-three Teresa, from Barton-under-Needwood, Staffordshie, added: ‘We were all in tears, so worried about what was going to happen.

‘She could have gone blind at any moment, but Lauren turned to us and said: “You lot need to man up, it is me that's got the problem, not you and the doctors will sort it out”.

‘She was amazing.

‘Lauren then had the two hour operation and within half an hour of waking up was eating chips, beans and ice cream, it was as if she was back to normal.

‘She was just a little tired.

‘Now I just think what could have been if I would have let her go on holiday, I don't even like to think about it.

‘We went back to Specsavers after Lauren came out of hospital to thank Mr Strachan.

‘He had a tear in his eye, we all did, it was very emotional.

During the surgery, surgeons removed most of the tumour but they were not able to remove all of it meaning that Lauren may require more surgery in future

‘She basically thanked him for saving her life, he did a fantastic job.’

Lauren, who already wore glasses but didn't have any symptoms before she went for her eye test, said: ‘I think everything went fine.

‘I was a little bit scared but it was
okay, I was just telling everyone to man up, they were all crying but 
it wasn't them having the operation.

‘It was good when I woke up because I had two dinners, I joked about having it but they actually gave it to me, it was great.

‘It was a bit strange going to sleep, 
but I am happy I am not in hospital anymore and I am happy that I am 
through the bad parts of everything now.’

Mr Strachan said  he was not aware of anybody else as young as Lauren having a deadly brain tumour discovered by an eye test.

He said: 'I'd never seen this in someone of such a young age before and without showing any real symptoms was really very unusual.

'I'm just so glad to see Lauren making a fantastic recovery - it was wonderful to see Lauren so soon after her operation.

'Her story is obviously quite unusual, but it does highlight how eye examinations can help identify a number of other health issues.

'With children we recommend getting their eyes checked from the age of three, unless like Ms Uncles, you have any concerns in which case they should come in sooner.'
