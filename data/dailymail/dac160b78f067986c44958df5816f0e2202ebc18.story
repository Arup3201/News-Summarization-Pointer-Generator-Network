But nobody was prepared for his pitch perfect custom rendition of the Leonard Cohen hit 'Hallelujah'.

Father Kelly, who has been parish priest at Oldcastle, north-west of Dublin since 2006, starts the song with the words: 'We join together here today, to help two people on their way, as Leah and Chirs start their life together.'

Family and friends at the wedding were also moved by Father Kelly's song

He then tailors the rest of the song to the newlyweds who look stunned by the surprise performance before the bride Mrs O'Kane can be seen wiping away tears of joy.

Midway through the song Father Kelly then raises his eyebrows to the surprised couple, who both break out into laughter.

He then carries on with the song with one of the bridesmaids also wiping a tear from her eye and the other congregation members looking on surprised.
