Rudolf Hess, Hitler's deputy, was captured in 1941 while flying to Scotland on a peace mission. Until now it was thought he acted alone

It is more than 70 years since Hitler's deputy, Rudolf Hess, parachuted into Scotland on an ill-fated peace mission to Britain which was thought to be a solo venture made without the Nazis' knowledge.

But now the discovery of a blocked oil pipe on the remains of his crashed aircraft suggest that he must have had help from inside Germany.

While examining the remains of Hess's Messerschmitt at the Imperial War Museum in Cambridge, authors John Harris and Richard Wilbourn found that a crucial pipe had been blanked off with a large brass nut.

They say that with only the main oil tank available Hess would not have been able to make the five-hour flight from Augsburg in Bavaria to Scotland and would have been forced to land in northern Germany to refuel.

In their new book on Hess, the authors say this means other people would have to have known about the flight and assisted Hess in keeping the plane on track.

Speaking to the Sunday Express, Mr Harris said: 'Our recent discoveries have essentially destroyed the illusion of a solo flight by the deputy Fuhrer who was trying to regain his former prestige.

'Our new work clearly demonstrates that the flight was planned in minute detail and required official support and connivance.'

Hess parachuted out of the plane, which eventually crashed near Glasgow and was preserved

New examination of the wreckage suggests Hess would have been forced to refuel in northern Germany during his flight, meaning officials must have known what he was doing

Hess was captured by the Allies in 1941 after he was discovered flying low over Scotland to see the Duke of Hamilton - a man he had never met - who he hoped would persuade Britain to the negotiating table.

Hess, Hitler's right-hand man, had seen his influence over the Fuhrer wain since the Nazi party's rise to power and the mission was seen as a desperate attempt to win back favour.

After his capture Hitler disowned him, abolishing the position of deputy and promoting Hess's rival Martin Bormann to the new post of Party Chancellery.

Hess remained behind bars in Britain for the remainder of the war, and was among the first to be tried at Nuremberg following the end of the fighting.

He was jailed for life in 1946 and held at Spandau Prison in Berlin until he hanged himself in 1987 at the age of 92.
