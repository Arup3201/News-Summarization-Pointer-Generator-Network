For Grace Bates, he was the one she let get away.

But now, the 74-year-old has finally been reunited with the handsome German man she split up with almost 60 years ago.

Ms Bates met her true love, Hermann Bosche, in 1956 as a 17-year-old. The pair quickly fell in love and planned a future together. 

But the problem with their blossoming relationship was that she was already engaged to someone else.

Grace Bates, 74, and Hermann Bosche, 78, have been reunited after spending almost 60 years apart 

Ms Bates met her true love, Hermann Bosche, in 1956 as a teenager but she was already engaged at the time

After she broke his heart, the blond 20-year-old left in 1958 for America and Ms Bates felt guilty about the break-up for decades. 

Her attempts to find him failed, but thanks to a BBC television show, she managed to track him down and finally say sorry. 

Now, after almost 60 years apart, the pair are beginning to rebuild their relationship.

'It’s like a dream come true to have found him. I feel my heart is back in the right place,' she told The Sunday Mirror. 

'I don’t want to go to my grave thinking I have never said sorry to him.' 

Recalling the moment she first saw him as she worked at a market near her home in Chellaston, Derbyshire, she said he was 'beautiful and handsome'. 

She added she didn't speak a word of German, but he taught her one phrase: ‘ich liebe dich’ which means 'I love you'. 

Mr Bosche, from Pennsylvania, had been happily married in America for 50 years before his wife died in 2013

She said she had wanted to break off the engagement because she 'knew Hermann was the one'.

But instead of ending things with her fiancé, she ended up pregnant after sleeping with him.

She hid the truth from Mr Bosche until she started to show - and when found out, he was devastated. 

Heartbroken, he left the country in May 1958.

She gave birth to a girl but her baby's father left her. To avoid the scandal, she was quickly married off again. It ended in divorce and Ms Bates never remarried.

She had given up hope of ever finding her true love again, but last year, researchers for a new BBC One programme traced Mr Bosche to Kunkletown, Pennsylvania.

Now 78, he had been happily married for 50 years before his wife died in 2013. 

They reunited in Lodnon and have since become good friends after speaking regularly. She has visited him twice in Pennsylvania.

'When I heard Grace wanted to get in touch I was a little numb at first because I haven’t thought of her in such a long time,' he said. 

'We all did something we shouldn’t have. I have no regrets.' 

She's felt guilty for decades, adding: 'I don’t want to go to my grave thinking I have never said sorry to him'
