E.W. Jackson Virginia's Republican nominee for lieutenant governor has suggested doing yoga could 'make Satan possess you'

Virginia's Republican nominee for lieutenant governor has suggested doing yoga could 'make Satan possess you', it has been claimed.

E.W. Jackson, a minister from Chesapeake, beat six other candidates to win the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket behind Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli.

Since then he has been no stranger to controversy.

So far he has compared the Democratic Party to a 'slave market' and said Planned Parenthood is more of a threat to black Americans than the Klu Klux Klan.

Now  the National Review’s Betsy Woodruff has posted passages from his 2008 book, 'Ten Commandments to an Extraordinary Life'.

In it he claims that 'emptying' oneself with yoga, can lead the devil to occupy the void.

He writes that while the word meditation 'conjures images' of Yoga and striving for nirvana: 'The purpose of such meditation is to empty oneself. … Satan is happy to invade the empty vacuum of your soul and possess it.

'That is why people serve Satan without ever knowing it or deciding to, but no one can be a child of God without making a decision to surrender to him. Beware of systems of spirituality which tell you to empty yourself. '

He adds that people could l end up filled with something 'you probably do not want.', Yahoo! news reports.

Jackson has never held public office. His first political campaign was last year, when he ran in a Republican primary for U.S. Senate and got less than 5 percent of the vote.

In a 'message to black Christians' posted on YouTube last year, Jackson says, 'It is time to end the slavish devotion to the Democrat Party.'

Jackson, a minister, he also compared the Democratic Party to a 'slave market' and said Planned Parenthood is more of a threat to black Americans than the Klu Klux Klan

'The Democrat Party has created an unholy alliance between certain so-called civil rights leaders and Planned Parenthood, which has killed unborn black babies by the tens of millions,' he says.

'Planned Parenthood has been far more lethal to black lives than the KKK ever was,' he continues. 'And the Democratic Party and their black civil rights allies are partners in this genocide.'

Also in the YouTubevideo, he condemns Democrats for 'equating homosexuality with being black.'

He says that discrimination against both groups cannot be lumped together under the same civil rights umbrella.

'They can keep their homosexuality private,' he says. 'You and I cannot hide being black.'

Jackson has also reportedly made a number of anti-gay statements in the past, comparing homosexuals to paedophiles and calling them 'frankly very sick people psychologically, mentally and emotionally.'
