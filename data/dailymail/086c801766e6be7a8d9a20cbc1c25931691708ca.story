Supercars are normally hard to miss on the high street, particularly when they're bright yellow, but a police officer was unable to avoid crashing into a Ferrari after an unsuccessful attempt at a u-turn.

Onlookers were stunned as they watched the silver BMW police car scrunch into the back of the Ferrari 458 Spider, which is worth around £250,000.

While a Metropolitan Police spokesman 
said it was too early to say who was at fault, witnesses who saw the incident on Sunday night report seeing 
the squad car attempting a three-point turn on the Edgware Road in London.

A police BMW has apparently crashed into the back of a £250,000 Ferrari 458 Spider causing £2,500 of damage 

A witness said that the Ferrari driver was reversing in order to pick up a friend when the squad car tried to make a three-point turn before the two vehicles locked bumpers

They said it failed to notice the supercar reversing before it smashed into the supercar.

The two vehicles then locked bumpers, with the Ferrari faring considerably worse with a large chunk of bodywork left hanging off.

The owner of the Ferrari, who wanted to remain anonymous, said the police car did not do a three-point turn but just attempted a u-turn.

'I was slowly reversing at 4mph and the police car was on the other side of the road. Instead of doing a three-point turn he just drove round and hit me.'

He said the police car's lights went on after the incident and that he was then breathalysed at the scene.

'It
 was quite a shunt and I had to stand outside in the cold for two hours 
while they were wearing warm jackets. They didn't let me sit inside a 
car.'

He said repairs to the Ferrari would cost up to £30,000 to repair.

A large crowd gathered in the street to 
watch as the two drivers are said to have swapped details before the 
police vehicle reversed away and drove off with its lights flashing.

One said: 'I have been filming supercars for many years around Europe but it's the first time I have seen an unfortunate incident like this involving the police.

'It created quite a scene and a lot of bystanders were photographing and filming the incident. It was an amazing combination of a supercar involved in a crash with the police.'

A Met spokesperson added: 'We can confirm a police car was in collision with a Ferrari. No one was injured during the collision and no arrests were made.'
