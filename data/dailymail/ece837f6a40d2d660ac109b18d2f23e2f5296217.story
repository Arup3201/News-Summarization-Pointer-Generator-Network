New Hull signing Mohamed Diame has admitted he left West Ham because of his frustration at being 'shunted around' at the club.

The 27-year-old completed the £3.5million move on deadline day following 79 appearances since signing for West Ham in 2012.

And Diame has said he is looking forward to playing in his favoured central midfield role at Hull, after feeling that he was misused at times by Sam Allardyce.

'Shunted around': The midfielder has admitted he became frustrated with his ever-changing role at West Ham

'At West Ham I was shunted around all the different positions,' he said, according to the Daily Star. 'I remember one time I had to play as a striker.

'That was not good for my career. I wanted to play for a club that is high in the Premier League table.

'At least with Hull I will be certain of playing in my favoured role.

'I should have left West Ham a long time ago, as with them I wasn't permitted to play in central midfield.

Reacquainted: But he will play his debut for Hull against his former side when the Premier League returns

'I wasn't able to get the biggest clubs interested in me, as when they came to watch me I'd been put in a position that was not mine.

'You lose your bearings when you get shunted around all the different positions.'

Diame is set to be reacquainted with his former club almost immediately, as West Ham travel to Hull in their first Premier League game following the international break on September 15.
