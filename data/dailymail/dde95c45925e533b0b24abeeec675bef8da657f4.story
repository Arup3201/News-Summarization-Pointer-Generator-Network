A children's fizzy drink sold by McDonald’s has won the right to be labelled as one of the recommended five-a-day portions of fruit and vegetables, even though it contains around six teaspoons of sugar.

The fast-food giant has been cleared by the Advertising Standards Authority watchdog to put Fruitizz in the same category as eating an apple or a serving of broccoli.

The drink is a mixture of fruit juice concentrate – including grape, raspberry and lemon – with fizzy water, natural flavourings and the preservative potassium sorbate.

Health pop: McDonald's has won the right to label its new Fruitizz drink as one of the recommended five-a-day portions of fruit and vegetables

A small 250ml serving, which costs 89p, has 100 calories and 25g of sugar, which equates to around six teaspoons.

The high levels of sugar come from the fruit juice content. But the ASA said that the addition of natural flavourings and preservatives in the drink ‘did not negate the five-a-day benefits of that 150ml of fruit juice, providing the entire 250ml serving was consumed’.

The ASA made its decision after an investigation, which was launched in response to complaints about a McDonald’s TV commercial and an advert on the Mumsnet website.

A voiceover on the TV advert said: ‘Grape, apple, and raspberry juice with refreshing sparkling water.

'Fruitizz is full of fruity bubbles with no added sugar, artificial colours or flavours. And it’s one of your child’s five a day.’

Malcolm Clark, of the Children’s Food Campaign, said the ASA ruling was evidence that the rules which define health claims around fruit and vegetables are not sufficiently strict.

He added: ‘McDonald’s is only doing what other companies do: exploiting the laxness surrounding the five-a-day claims regime for commercial benefit.

‘We are concerned that increasingly the five-a-day message – originally designed to tackle cancer and heart disease – is being used to promote junk foods, sometimes with very low fruit or vegetable content.

‘If the Government actually values the five-a-day claim and wants it to be a meaningful label that consumers can have confidence in, they need to re-issue and reinforce robust guidance restricting the five-a-day message to genuinely healthy foods.’

Dietitian Christina Merryfield, of London’s Bupa Cromwell Hospital, said: ‘Sugary drinks can encourage tooth decay and erosion and lead to weight gain.

'Water is a much better option and milk is great because it is full of calcium and other vitamins and minerals.’

A McDonald’s spokesman said: ‘We welcome the ruling by the ASA. Fruitizz is a drink designed for the Happy Meal menu, served in a 250ml measure as standard and it is not marketed in any larger sizes.

‘In the development of Fruitizz we followed the five-a-day guidance provided by the Department of Health.

‘Fruitizz contains no added sugars, artificial colours or artificial flavours and all size servings provide one daily portion of fruit, as defined by the Department of Health.’
