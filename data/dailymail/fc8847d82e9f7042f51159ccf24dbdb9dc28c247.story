The vast majority of Britain’s traffic lights are dangerous and should be ‘torn down’, according to the chairman of the National Trust.

Sir Simon Jenkins believes the signals are a means of ‘state control’ which cause more accidents than they prevent.

In an impassioned plea, Sir Simon argues that as a nation we have become ‘obsessed’ with traffic lights and that if he were in charge he would tear down 90 per cent of them.

Interviewed in the December issue of Readers’ Digest, he said: ‘Most accidents take place at traffic lights because everyone is looking at the lights and not at other road users.

‘We’re obsessed with traffic lights in Britain, and in London there’s a light practically every 30 yards, mostly with a clear street ahead. They’re a very inefficient way of enabling road users to get around.

 ‘I’d tear down 90 per cent of traffic lights. They are merely ways in which the state exerts control over us. They’re also dangerous,’ he added.

Sir Simon’s remarks have not been met with wide approval from road safety groups.

Think you might be spending more time at a red? You could be right. Traffic lights have been with us since the 1920s but in recent times their numbers have exploded, up a third in the past decade alone

Some signals and signs are now being removed in towns across Britain. Mayor of London Boris Johnson has ordered a review of thousands of lights in the capital, and more than 20 have already been taken out

RAC technical director David Bizley said: ‘There is growing evidence that in many high streets and densely populated urban areas, a simplification of traffic control would be beneficial in terms of cutting accident numbers and improving the flow of traffic.

‘However, the majority of traffic lights fulfil an important safety role for both road users and pedestrians.

‘In many situations the removal of traffic lights would actually do more harm than good by causing far greater congestion, because it would take away the ability to control traffic flows to reflect changing demand patterns.

‘Just imagine what traffic would have been like during the Olympics this summer if London hadn’t had the ability to manage traffic flows and priorities via traffic lights from a central control centre.’

Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, says that traffic lights are ‘essential’.

He said: ‘Although there may be some that could be removed or changed without causing too many problems, removing most of them would cause gridlock and result in more, not fewer, accidents.

‘It is incorrect to say that most accidents occur at traffic lights, and when accidents do happen at traffic light junctions, it is not because drivers are distracted by looking at the lights.

‘There are many causes — running the red light, approaching too fast, not anticipating that the lights will change, following too closely, pedestrians stepping out without looking, to mention a few.’

However, Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, believes that there are now too many traffic lights on our roads.

‘If drivers think they are spending more time stuck at red, they would be right,’ he said.

‘Traffic lights have been with us since the 1920s, but in recent times, their numbers have exploded, up a third in the past decade alone.

‘Finely tuned, they play a vital role, but inconsistently set, they can be the source of immense frustration, especially where they are seen to unfairly favour one type of road user over another — for example, thousands of sets of lights put buses first.’

In 2005, almost all traffic lights were removed from the Dutch town of Drachten, pictured, as part of a radical road safety experiment. The result was a reduction in accidents

Supporters of the concept believe that roads become safer as drivers, pedestrians and cyclists take more care in the absence of traffic lights.

In the interview entitled ‘If I ruled the world,’ Sir Simon, 69, also says he would make a history a compulsory lesson at school, prevent any building over a hundred years being demolished and would stop building on green fields.
