Darren Bent made the most of his Aston Villa return - scoring twice in their pre season opener - with Gary Gardner also on target as Paul Lambert's side ran out 3-1 winners against Mansfield.

The Villa boss admitted this week that his high earners could make a return to the side with owner Randy Lerner desperate to sell, and he was true to his word as another outcast, Alan Hutton, laid on the equaliser for Bent.

Villa's Â£24million record signing Bent spent last season on loan at Fulham, while Hutton has yet to make a competitive appearance in Lambert's two years at Villa Park due to his high wages.

But it wasn't all about returning stars - Joe Cole and Kieran Richardson made their debuts at the One Call Stadium, with the former deployed in the No 10 role that he has long craved to play in.

Despite the strong side put out by Lambert and new assistant Roy Keane, the Sky Bet League Two side led at the break through an Alex Fisher header.

But Bent made the difference in an entirely changed second half line-up, tapping home a Hutton cut-back to equalise on 61 minutes.

Gary Gardner put Villa in front in the 85th minute and Bent scored his second when he headed home an Andreas Weimann cross in the final minute.
