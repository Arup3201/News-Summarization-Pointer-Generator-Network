After a year of speculation, countless leaks and many rival devices, Apple is on the verge of unveiling its next-generation iPhone 6 at an event in California. 

The event begins at 10am PDT (6pm BST) at the same location Steve Jobs unveiled the first Mac computer 20 years ago. 

Alongside two new larger-screen iPhones, Apple may also use the event to finally unveil a smartwatch - a device that has been on the cards since 2012.

After a year of speculation, countless leaks and many rival devices, Apple is on the verge of unveiling its next-generation iPhone 6 (concept image pictured) at an event in California

It is unsure whether the watch will be called the iWatch, or iTime - but numerous sources are reporting the device is incoming. 

Other reports have also suggested Apple could reveal its new range of iPads, which is typically reserved for a separate event in October.

Before the event, rumours claimed Apple was working on two versions of its next iPhone, in different sizes, with one being 4.7 inches (11.9cm) diagonally, the same size as the HTC One.

A larger version was also rumoured to be released, measuring 5.5 inches (14cm) - slightly larger than Samsung's 5.1-inch Galaxy S5.

Leaked specifications earlier today claimed the device would have an Apple A8 processor, 1GB of memory, 128GB of storage and an 8MP camera.

Although this is the same as the current model, reports claim Apple has improved the camera's overall performance 'in other ways.'

The 4.7-inch iPhone will reportedly come with a display resolution of 1334 x 750.

The new products have been overseen by senior vice president of design at Apple, Sir Jonathan Ive (pictured). Last week, reports claimed Sir Ive had joked that 'Switzerland is trouble' - making reference to the fact that the iWatch could disrupt the traditional watchmaking nation's business

Previous rumours have pointed to a super slim 'iPhone Air' model, which is expected to be the smaller handset.

In April, Taiwan-based Commercial Times similarly referenced a 2mm-thick battery. 

This
 follows the release of Apple’s super-thin iPad Air last year, which, at
 0.2-inches (7.5mm) thick, is 2mm thinner than the iPad 4’s 0.4-inch 
(9.4mm) depth.

Two concept images released earlier this year depicted Apple’s next-generation handset with a slender chassis, as well as a larger 5-inch screen similar to those seen on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One.

The first concept predicted the phone will be 4.5mm thick. Other designers, including Martin Hajek, have imagined what both the iPhone 6 and the iWatch will look like.

Before the event, rumours claimed Apple was working on two versions of its next iPhone, in different sizes - 4.7-inches and 5.5-inches. Previous rumours also pointed to a super slim 'iPhone Air' model, (leaked handset pictured right, next to the current iPhone 5S left)

While the second went a step further showing the device as 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom.

By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.2 inches (7.6mm). The iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm.

In order to make the Apple phone super-thin, the second concept suggested doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys. 

The event is being held at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts at De Anza College in Cupertino, the same location where Steve Jobs introduced the original Mac 30 years ago

Speculation around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013.

Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget.

It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone.

Other rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen.

Last week, reports claimed Apple's iPhone 6 will include a system that lets owners pay in stores by tapping their phone on a reader. Called Near Field Communication (NFC), the technology is already widely used by credit cards for low-cost payments. A leaked handset (pictured) appeared to show an updated Passbook app

The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet.

Apple previously hinted at the wearable in the latest update to its iOS software, which includes health tracking capabilities.

In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. 

Last week, new details also emerged of the firm's iWatch, claiming it would come in male and female versions, with flexible screen sizes of 1.3 and 1.5-inches.

The event is being held at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts at De Anza College in Cupertino, the same location where Steve Jobs introduced the original Mac 30 years ago.
