A 12-year-old girl collapsed and died of natural causes after being hit by a rugby ball during PE class, a coroner ruled.

Leonie Nice was playing tag rugby in the playground at Woodlands Comprehensive School in Basildon, Essex when she collapsed and appeared to suffer a fit after the ball struck her in March.

Forensic pathologist Dr Nat Carey ruled out the possibility that being struck by the ball could have triggered her tragic death at an inquest in Chelmsford, Essex today.

Died of natural causes: Leonie Price, 12, who collapsed and died in March after being struck by a rugby ball died of natural causes, a coroner ruled today

Teachers attempted CPR and an ambulance rushed the year seven student to nearby Basildon Hospital but she was pronounced dead shortly after arrival at 12.51pm.

Dr Carey said at the inquest: ‘In my opinion I do not think the strike from the ball should be viewed as a precipitating factor in her death.’

A detailed post-mortem, which included 
input from heart disease experts at Great Ormond Street Hospital, 
revealed Leonie had died of a ‘sudden heart rhythm disturbance’ brought 
on by arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, an inherited 
muscle disorder.

'Healthy little girl': The post-mortem found that Leonie was healthy but died of a 'sudden heart rhythm disturbance'

Dr Carey described Leonie as a ‘healthy little girl’ who showed no sign of infection and suffered no external trauma from being hit by the ball. She suffered only minor bruising to her left eyebrow associated with her sudden collapse.

He said: ‘The heart is an electrical organ. This means that people with this condition are vulnerable to sudden death and that can happen at any time.’

The inherited muscle disorder is characterised by the degeneration of the right ventricle of the heart where normal heart muscle is replaced by fat and scar tissue.

It can cause abnormal electrical heart rhythms and weakening of the pumping action of the heart.

Leonie’s family, including her mother Kelley Nice, partner Paul Elam and Leonie’s grandparents, sat in silence throughout the ten minute inquest. They did not wish to speak after the hearing.

Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray praised the ‘commendable’ attempts of teachers at the school to administer CPR and described Leonie’s death as ‘sudden and unexpected’ before recording a verdict of death by natural causes.

She said: ‘Leonie was clearly a much loved little girl with a bright future ahead of her.

‘I hope you will be able to treasure the bright and happy memories you have of her.’

At the time of Leonie's death, student Jeswin Babu, 12, described the harrowing moment she slumped to the ground in front of her classmates.

He said: 'The girls said she got hit by a rugby ball and fell over and hit her head and stopped breathing. Her face started to go blue.

'We had a special assembly and they said we could ring our parents and go home early.

'Her older sister and her best friends were taken straight to hospital by the police.

'We found out she had died when her sister posted on BBM (BlackBerry Messenger).'

Leonie’s death triggered a huge outpouring of grief from classmates on social networking sites when she died.

One pupil wrote: ‘RIP to our beautiful friend Leonie-Jo Nice. 

‘A stunning girl that was only young, hopes to her family, we all love you, our gorgeous angel3.’

Another wrote: ‘Cant get over the fact that Leonie is gone... I grew up with her and she was such a sweet girl, £RIPLeonie. Everyone is thinking of you 3.’

Hundreds of mourners, wearing pink and black, attended Leonie’s funeral in May this year 2012.

A touching family tribute read out at the service described Leonie as ‘the friendliest person you could ever meet’.

It continued: ‘She loved life and her two favourite loves were music and drama. She loved prac-tising her singing in the shed, which was her secret place.

‘She was bubbly and outspoken, funny and so patient. She was just simply perfect.’

Leonie’s death came just a fortnight after 16-year-old Kyle Rees died after being hit on the head by a cricket ball at school in Bournemouth, Dorset.

At least 12 young people die suddenly each week of cardiac abnormalities in the UK. The majority of young cardiac deaths are due to inherited forms of heart muscle disorder and irregular heart beat.
