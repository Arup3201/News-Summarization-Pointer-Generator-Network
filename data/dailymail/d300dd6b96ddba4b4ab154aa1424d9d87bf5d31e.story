Chilling images have revealed the charred wreckage of the private jet that crashed near Boston on Saturday, killing seven people including billionaire Lewis Katz.

The photographs show the shell of the burned-out aircraft splayed across the banks of the Shawsheen River after leaving a trail of debris across the field in Bedford, Massachusetts where it erupted in flames following a takeoff attempt at Hanscom Field.

Investigators have now revealed that the crash was so quick that the pilots had no time to issue a mayday as the plane, a Gulfstream IV owned by Katz, hurtled 2,000 feet off the runway. It then plowed through a fence and across the river banks - killing everyone on board - before coming to a stop.

Chilling: An image taken on Monday shows the charred wreckage of the Gulfstream IV that erupted into flames near Boston on Saturday, killing seven

Terror: An image shows the plane crash at the bottom of the runway at Hanscom Field. The aircraft was heading to Atlantic City on Saturday

'It's our understanding from a witness
 the aircraft never became airborne,' Luke Schiada, senior air safety 
investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board, told the 
Boston Herald.

'My 
understanding is there wasn’t any abnormal communication... We haven’t 
ruled out anything, but there’s no reason to suggest it was anything but
 an accident.'

The plane, 
which was bound for Atlantic City, was carrying seven people, and six 
have now been identified by the District Attorney's Office.

Katz, 72, perished just four days after he won control of the Philadelphia Inquirer following a bitter legal battle.

Marcella
 Dalsey, the executive director of his son Drew's foundation, also died 
alongside Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, Marcella Dalsey, 59, from Williamstown, New Jersey and Katz's nieghbor Anne Leeds of Longport, New Jersey.

The
 pilot was identified as James McDowell, 51, from Georgetown, Delaware, 
and Teresa Ann Benhoff, 48, from Easton, Maryland was on board as air 
crew.

Board has taken over the investigation into the plane crash to determine
 what caused it. So far they have not speculated

Skeleton: The pilots did not even have time to issue a mayday as the plane, a Gulfstream IV owned by Katz, hurtled 2,000 feet off the runway

The DA's office said there is 'still one autopsy and positive identification to be made'.

Nearby residents recounted seeing a fireball and feeling the blast of the explosion shake their homes.

Authorities
 have not speculated on what caused the crash but investigations by the 
National Transportation Safety Board are underway.

The
 plane was headed to Atlantic City International Airport in New Jersey 
when it apparently went off the runway and crashed at 9:40pm then caught
 fire, authorities said.

Jeff Patterson told The Boston Globe he saw a fireball about 60 feet in the air.

'I
 heard a big boom, and I thought at the time that someone was trying to 
break into my house because it shook it,' said Patterson's son, 
14-year-old Jared Patterson. 'I thought someone was like banging on the 
door trying to get in.'

The air field has been closed for further investigation.

Boston.com
 reports that residents who lived as far as Boston could smell burning 
rubber and many took to Twitter to describe the incident.

'Can actually see particles in air in Cambridge, Porter Square allegedly from Hanscom crash,' tweeted Aubry Bracco.

Katz, 72, and business partner H.F. 'Gerry' 
Lenfest only recently became the controlling owners of the Inquirer, The
 Daily News and Philly.com after buying out the other partners for 
$88million in a Tuesday private auction.

'We
 all deeply mourn the loss of my true friend and fellow investor in 
ownership of The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Daily News and Philly.com,' 
Lenfest said. 'It is a severe loss, but I am pleased to announce that 
Drew Katz, Lewis's son, will replace his father on the board of our new 
company.'

Drew Katz issued a statement of his own as well, praising his father. 

'My father was my best friend. He 
taught me everything. He never forgot where and how he grew up, and he 
worked tirelessly to support his community in countless ways that were 
seen and unseen,' Drew Katz said in a statement.

'He loved his native 
city of Camden and his adopted home of Philadelphia. He believed in 
strengthening education through his founding of charter schools, his 
support of the Boys & Girls Clubs and his generosity to his alma 
maters, Temple University and Dickinson Law School.

'But his greatest 
accomplishment by far was being the most amazing father to my sister and
 me, and grandparent to his four grandchildren.'

Mr Leeds told the Press of Atlantic City that his wife, Anne, had been invited last minute to attend a fundraiser with Katz in Concord, Saturday afternoon.

Horror: A Twitter user shared this horrifying image of the flames after the crash at Hanscom Field. Witnesses reported smelling rubber for miles

Update: NTSB Senior Air Safety Investigator Luke Schiada speaks during a news conference at Hanscom Field in Bedford on Monday

The Boston Globe reports that Katz attended an event at the home of historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and her husband Richard Goodwin.

Mr
 Leeds says that event was in support of an education program the 
Goodwin's son Michael created for Concord Carlisle schools - a matter of
 interest to Mrs Leeds, a retired Pennsylvania school teacher.

Marcella Dalsey, the executive director of the Drew A Katz Foundation, also died in the crash.

Ms
 Dalsey, a South New Jersey native, was also the president of KATZ 
Academy Charter School which she co-founded with Katz in 2012.

Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey - the wife of former Camden County Prosecutor Sam Asbell – was another victim.

Before the auction, Katz and Lenfest owned 42.55 per cent of the team. They bought out a competing group led by George E Norcross III, who previously held a 57.45 per cent stake.

The buyout promised to bring more stability to the media company, which had undergone six ownership changes in eight years.

'We know more than anybody how difficult this business is,' Katz told employees Tuesday afternoon at the company's headquarters. 'We're going to give it our best. We're going to try to bring in the best. And, hopefully, we'll have a wonderful result.'

His tragic death 'won't derail the sale of the Inquirer, Daily News & Philly.com' the newspaper said on its Twitter feed.

Killed: Lewis Katz, 72, was among the 7 people who perished in the crash - which occurred just four days after he won control of the Philadelphia Inquirer

foundation, and Anne Leeds (right), wife of Longport, New Jersey 
commissioner James Leeds, died

Lenfest
 told the newspaper he has owned for less than a week, 'It is a severe 
loss, but I am pleased to announce that Drew Katz, Lewis's son, will 
replace his father on board of our new company.'

However,
 Lenfest did admit that there would be a delay in the finalizing of the 
deal, but that it was expected to close after June 12.

The
 new owner said that the newspaper would be hard pressed to replace 
Katz's expertise and creativity, but that 'the paper will continue 
because we both intended to put a new CEO in charge of the day-to-day 
operations'.

Katz grew up in Camden, New Jersey and attended Temple University. Katz made 
his money investing in the Kinney Parking empire and once owned the 
NBA's New Jersey Nets and the NHL's New Jersey Devils and donated money 
to Temple University.

A public memorial service for Philadelphia Inquirer co-owner Lewis Katz will be held Wednesday at Temple University in Philadelphia.
