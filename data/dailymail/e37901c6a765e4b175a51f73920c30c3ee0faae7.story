It's only 27 days into Lent but today is when many Brits will give in to temptation and indulge themselves in the guilty pleasure they promised to sacrifice for 40 days.

A survey carried out by supermarket chain Asda of 2,000 shoppers found that 34 per cent will end their abstinence today.

The majority of respondents (41 per cent) cited a bad week at work as the main reason for succumbing to temptation followed by peer pressure from friends and family who aren't giving anything up (35 per cent).

Giving in: Those who gave up coffee and social networking for Lent were most likely to cave in first

For a fifth, the thought that they had almost lasted a month was enough to make them feel less guilty about giving up before the end of Lent.

Chocolate is a common sacrifice at Lent but many can't go the full 40 days without it

Regardless of religious inclination, three quarters of Brits still use Lent as an opportunity to give up bad habits.

The most common things to forgo for the 40-day period were food-related or social networks.

Carbs (19 per cent) was the most popular food type to avoid followed by chocolate (16 per cent).

More people said they would give up Twitter (17 per cent) than Facebook (12 per cent) while avoiding swearing also made the top five sacrifices.

It seems what you decide to give up 
determines how long you'll last.

Those who gave up coffee and social 
networking sites were more likely to fail sooner than those who gave up 
carbs and chocolate  - perhaps because the latter were able to see 
almost immediate results from their sacrifices.

Asda nutritionist
Hayley Marson said: 'Giving up anything entirely for a long period of 
time can be tough, so it’s easy to see why people crack before the 40 
days is up.

'It’s 
interesting to see that those who gave up sugary or fatty foods were 
most likely to stick to it; probably because of the obvious health 
benefits associated with a reduced calorie diet, such as weight loss.

'The thought of devouring a delicious chocolate Easter egg as a reward at the end of it probably helps too!'

Lent begins on Ash Wednesday and ends at Easter and is a Christian tradition marking the Biblical story of when Jesus when into the desert and was tempted by the devil.
