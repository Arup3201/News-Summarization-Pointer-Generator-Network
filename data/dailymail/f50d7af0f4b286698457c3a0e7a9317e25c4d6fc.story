Alan Shearer has launched a ferocious critique of modern English footballers ahead of the new season, claiming they are 'overpaid' in a 'too-much-too-young' industry and lack the 'hunger' and 'desire' to resist the glut of foreign imports.

Shearer also admitted he feared England were doomed to fail at Euro 2016 with no quick exit from the mess in evidence at the World Cup in Brazil and blamed Roy Hodgson for repeating the mistakes he made at Euro 2012.

'We were hopeless,' fumed the former England captain. 'No-one can argue with that. No-one can say we were great, can they? Roy can’t sit there and say we played some good football and we were unlucky. We weren’t. We weren’t good enough.'

Opinionated: Alan Shearer was far from happy with England's World Cup performances in Brazil

Shearer, who scored 30 goals in 63 games for his country, delivered his gloomy forecast at a preview screening of the BBC documentary 'Match of the Day at 50' which celebrates the flagship football show.

'It is worrying,' he said. 'There’s so many reasons, not one. There’s too many foreign players and English players are not getting a chance, absolutely. They’ re paid too much too young, not enough hunger, without a doubt, desire, being put on a pedestal too quickly.

'Put all those together and it’s the reason why we put in another poor performance at a World Cup. Can I see it changing? I desperately hope so, but I don’t see it changing in the near future. I see it changing in six-eight-10 years.

'I don’t see it changing at the next tournament. I hope I’m wrong.'

England returned with only one point from three games in Brazil, finishing bottom of a group won by Costa Rica, but the performances of young players like Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley seemed to offer encouragement.

'We keep on throwing young names forward every two or four years, to say: "these are the ones" but there’s not many keep coming through,' said Shearer. 'I was one of the few who stuck with Roy after the tournament and said he should be in charge.

Public backing: Shearer believes Hodgson is the right man for the job despite England's World Cup failure

Too much, too soon: Shearer believes England's young starlets are picking up huge wage cheques 

'I still say that but, on the other hand, when you look at teams like Costa Rica, you can’t say they had more ability than us but they were better organised and they got further in the tournament than us and there has to be a big question mark.

'We made the same mistakes in this tournament we made in the last tournaments, two years ago and four years ago. Two years ago we couldn’t get hold of Pirlo. This tournament we still couldn’t get hold of Pirlo. It doesn’t take a genius to work that out, does it?'

Shearer, who admits he no longer has an appetite to be a manager, wants to see a return to a tougher apprenticeship but young English players are so prized by clubs that they can demand inflated transfer fees and wages.

Jose Mourinho revealed that Luke Shaw, 19, wanted more than £100,000 a week to join Chelsea from Southampton this summer. Barkley has signed a new contract at the Everton since the World Cup thought to be worth £65,000-a-week. Liverpool are keen to offer Sterling, also 19, a pay-rise to his £30,000-a-week deal after a good season.

'I don’t want to sound like an old f**t but they get paid too much too soon,' said Shearer. 'It has to have an effect. I got paid £27-a-week when I was 17 on a youth training scheme at Southampton. Did I like it? No, I didn’t but looking back it did me the world of good.

'I had to clean the boots and clean the toilets. The only time I was allowed in the first-team dressing room was to put the boots out, but there was a hunger and desire for me to get into that dressing room.

'I would dearly love that old apprenticeship to come back. I hated it at the time, but it didn’t half give me a good grounding. It taught me respect.'
