Queens Park Rangers have confirmed the appointment of Chris Ramsey as head coach until the end of the season. 

Ramsey is said to have earned the right to take charge of the Barclays Premier League strugglers on a temporary basis after impressing the west London club's owner Tony Fernandes. 

The likes of Tim Sherwood, Michael Laudrup and Neil Lennon have all been linked with the vacant post at QPR since Harry Redkanpp's decision to leave the club due to a persistent knee injury.

However Fernandes has placed his faith in former Tottenham coach Ramsey to help steer QPR to Premier League safety following his side's 2-0 away win against Sunderland on Tuesday.

The 52-year-old will work closely with first team coach Kevin Bond and goalkeeping coach Kevin Hitchcock until the end of the current campaign, while director of football Les Ferdinand will also play a significant role in the management set up. 

Fernandes told QPR's official website: 'In the wake of Harry Redknapp's resignation, it was my desire to identify the right individual for the job and at this time, we believe Chris is the ideal candidate.

'He has impressed everyone here in his short time in charge and I firmly believe he is the right man – working closely with Les – to lead us until the end of the season.

'Chris has an opportunity now to stamp his authority and class on the position. He is part of our long-term plans at QPR.

'A lot has been written and said about the position, including by myself, but the decision has been taken to defer the permanent appointment until the end of the season.

'We spoke to many individuals who were interested in the role, one of whom I was quoted on as being a dream, but none of them were right to take the club forward at this time for a variety of reasons, whereas we firmly believe Chris is.

'We are keen for the position to be a long-term appointment that will play a major role in shaping the future on-field progression of QPR. For that reason, it is vitally important that we get the right individual.

'As a Board of Directors, we are determined to make the right appointment in the best interests of the club.

'Premier League survival is our priority in the short term, but in the medium and long term we want to make sure everything is in place, from the Academy upwards, to create a lasting legacy and philosophy at QPR.' 

Director of football Ferdinand added: 'I've been liaising closely with the Board over the last week or so regarding the position and it became apparent that Chris is the best man for the job at this time.

'He's settled into QPR fantastically well over the last few months. He is highly thought of by everybody and has the respect of everyone connected to the club.

'He will have a huge part to play in the long-term future of this club at all levels, and we are confident that Chris, supported by the backroom staff, will be able to deliver our goal of Premier League survival.' 

Caretaker manager Ramsey, who was congratulated on his new role by club captain Joey Barton on Thursday, also had his say on the appointment by stating he was honoured to be offered the role until the end of the season.

'This is a great privilege and an honour for me. I am excited about leading the club between now and the end of the season,' said Ramsey.

'I believe in this group of players, the staff, and everyone working at the club.

'I'd like to thank the QPR supporters for their support so far and with their backing, I am confident that we can build on Tuesday's win at Sunderland and start to climb the table.

'During this period, I will still be involved in the running of the Academy for the rest of this season and beyond. Continuity is very important when it comes to the development of young players, which is something I am very mindful of.'

QPR chairman Tony Fernandes will appoint Chris Ramsey as Rangers boss until the end of the season.

Here Sportsmail look at five key issues he needs to address to ensure they beat the drop.

AWAY FORM

Despite picking up their first win on the road against Sunderland last time out, the previous 11 matches did not yield a single point for Rangers. With Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea still to come to Loftus Road, their away form could be the key to ensuring their Premier League survival.

LEAKY DEFENCE

Rangers have the joint worst defensive record in the league and, with goals also at a premium, tightening up at the back is a must. Harry Redknapp failed to identify his preferred central defensive partnership so finding a system that gets the best out of Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker could make the difference.

SHARE THE GOALS

Charlie Austin has contributed 50 per cent of QPR's goals in the Premier League and that form has rightly led to talk of a potential England call-up. But Ramsey will be looking for someone else to help shoulder the scoring burden, especially with the former Burnley man not having scored in open play since the December win over West Brom.

CALM JOEY BARTON DOWN

This may be easier said than done, with the combative midfielder becoming the first player in Premier League history to be cautioned in seven consecutive matches. Barton's leadership qualities and never-say-die attitude are far more beneficial on the field than off it, so avoiding suspensions is crucial.

INTEGRATE A SQUAD OF EGOS

Barton, Adel Taarabt, Ferdinand. None of the three are afraid to speak their minds and they are not the only squad members with chequered pasts. Sandro and Mauro Zarate have also had high-profile disagreements with managers and Ramsey will need to forge a team ethos to stand any chance of survival.
