An Oklahoma man entangled in a shocking love triangle was killed Friday, allegedly at the hands of his adversary: his own former son-in-law.

Police say Rodney Aaron Wilson, 38, of Stilwell shot and killed Rickey Lee Harlin, 53, on the evening of December 27 before calling 911 to report he'd fired in self-defense.

Meanwhile, the victim's daughter and ex-wife of the accused killer Stacie Catron, 36, has unwittingly become a fourth player in this deadly game and says the two men were feuding over the affections of the same woman.

What's more, investigations have revealed that Wilson has had deadly encounters with family before.

Feud gone too far? Rodney Aaron Wilson, 38, is awaiting charges he shot dead his ex father-in-law as part of what his ex-wife says was a squabble over a woman they were both pursuing

Gone: Rickey Lee Harlin is dead and police believe it was at the hands of his former son-in-law. Wilson called 911 to Harlin's Oklahoma home on Friday claiming he'd shot Harlin in self-defense. Authorities arrive to find Harlin dead

In November of 2000, Wilson was arrested and charged with the murder of his own stepmother.

Police arrived at the scene of Wilson's most recent entanglement to find Harlin already dead on the ground.

'When I arrived both vehicles were sitting in the drive,' Adair County Sheriff David Hardin told 5newsonline.com.

'I don’t know whose vehicle it is, but there was a Tahoe and Mr. Wilson’s truck sitting behind it, and I did notice Mr. Harlin, the deceased, lying on the ground in front of Mr. Wilson’s truck,' he continued.

Wilson was arrested on suspicion of first degree murder on Friday and the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation was called in to take over the case.

'While the investigation into the murder continues, it appears Wilson went to Harlin's home where a confrontation ensued,' the OSBI wrote in a December 29 release.

As of Monday, no official charges had been filed against Wilson, suggesting that investigators still aren't sure what went on during the confrontation.

However, Catron, who has a 15-year-old son with Wilson, says she knows what led to it.

'[They] were involved with the same woman,' she told NewsOK.

According to that same source, Wilson has had bad blood with relatives before.

In 2000, he was hauled to jail and booked for the murder of Theresa Wilson--his stepmother.

Theresa Wilson was found dead from a gunshot wound in the front seat of a pickup truck after a dispute with Rodney.

Catron said the charges were later dropped and expunged from Wilson's record.

While Wilson's history make render recent allegations unsurprising, he son seems to think the men were on relatively decent terms.

Also named Rodney, Wilson's son told 5newsonline they share no violent history. He also said how much he'll miss the grandfather he says raised him.

'He showed me everything I know, how to work, how to do anything, ride a horse, build something, and I learned how to respect people,' he said.

Wilson is being held without bail until January 9, by which time prosecutors anticipate they'll have gathered sufficient evidence for a first degree murder charge.
