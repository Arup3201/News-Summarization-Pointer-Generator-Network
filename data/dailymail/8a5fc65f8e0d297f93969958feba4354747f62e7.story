A slimmer who shed eight stone to qualify for an NHS breast reduction says she was better off fat after being refused the treatment despite her weightloss.

Marie Pickstock, 44, from Lancing, West Sussex, begged medics to reduce her 44M boobs because they were so big she could barely walk.

But the 22-stone mother was told if she wanted to qualify for taxpayer funded surgery she had to lose weight.

Letdown: Marie Pickstock, 44, shed eight stone to qualify for a life-changing breast reduction but was then refused the treatment

As she was: Marie begged medics to reduce her 44M boobs because they were so big she couldn't even walk

However, after shedding 8st 6lb she was told she couldn't have the breast reduction after all because her case wasn't extreme enough.

As a result, she says she was better off when she was overweight - as at least she had 
her large stomach to rest her boobs on, and take the weight off her 
back.

The mother-of-two said she now has no body confidence with her size 10 figure and 36L chest.

She said: 'I have no confidence. I don't like showing myself to anyone and I refuse to undress in front of my husband.

'I should be super confident and proud of my new slim body, but instead I feel horrible.

Diet: At 22-stone, the mother was told if she wanted to qualify for taxpayer funded surgery she had to lose some weight

Slimming down: Over the next two years Marie cut out takeaways and shed 8st 6lb

'My
 boobs are so big I feel like I am going to topple forwards. At least 
when I was bigger the fat balanced me out and I could actually walk 
better.'

But
 the mother says she struggles most with the abuse she receives from 
strangers in the street, who shout comments such as, 'you wouldn't need an anchor to make
 you sink'.

She said she feels 'let-down' by the NHS who refuse to help her.

The
 full-time mother said: 'The doctor said I had to help myself first, 
which I have done. So why won't they give me a breast reduction? I feel really let down by the NHS because I stuck to my side of the bargain.

'I
 have saved the tax payer thousands by losing weight through dieting and
 not asking for a gastric band. I'm not asking the NHS for this 
operation for cosmetic reasons. My breasts are ruining my life.'

Marie has suffered with large breasts since she was a schoolgirl.

She was a DD before her school friends even started wearing bras then shot up to a 44M when she became obese.

Her weight increased when she started comfort eating. She would consume a burger or sausage with chips every day and  regularly ordered takeaway pizzas with a kebab on top.

After years of debilitating back pain and reduced mobility, Marie approached medics about a breast reduction in 2011.

They
 told her under strict NHS guidelines she would only be entitled to the 
£7,000 procedure if she lost a considerable amount of weight first.

Marie

 drafted in the support of her overweight husband and two daughters. By 
cutting out the unhealthy foods that had been their staple diet, between
 the four of them they shed more than 30 stone.

Disappointment: When she went back to doctors they told her she didn't qualify for a breast reduction because her case wasn't extreme enough

Regret: Marie now says she was better off when she was fat because at least she had her huge stomach to rest her boobs on - and take the weight off her back

But
 despite dropping 14 dress sizes, Marie can still only wear size 26 
dresses - which 'drown' her bottom which is now a size ten - because are
 breasts are still so large.

She said she still looks obese despite her hard efforts to lose weight and has to buy specially-made £40 bras.

Her large breasts have forced her confidence to plummet so much, she is registered depressed with her GP.

She also suffers from severe angina and relies on taking strong pain 
killers, Co-codamol, four times a day to manage her back and neck pain.

And a private consultant Marie saw warned her mammograms are unlikely to pick
 up cancerous lumps in her breasts as they are too large for the scans 
to be accurate.

A
 private consultant who saw Marie estimated she would lose three stone 
if she had a breast reduction - taking her weight down to a healthy 10st
 7lb.

However, she's been told she can't have the operation on the NHS as her case isn't 'exceptional'.

An
 NHS West Sussex spokesman said: 'CCG policy, and that of its 
predecessor body the primary care trust, is clear that breast reduction 
surgery is not a procedure routinely available on the NHS.

'If
 a patient feels they need this treatment, their clinician would have to
 make an application to a specialist panel for individual funding 
demonstrating that there are exceptional clinical circumstances why the 
patient should receive the treatment outside of the policy.

'We
 understand Mrs Pickstock’s case was considered three times by the 
specialist panel run by the former primary care trust in 2011 and 2012 
and it found no clinical evidence that Mrs Pickstock’s case was 
exceptional.

'We
 appreciate this is disappointing for Mrs Pickstock, particularly after 
her recent weight loss, but would like to make it clear a patient’s 
weight is not taken into consideration as part of this process.

'As
 commissioners, we ensure that local health professionals are informed 
about the process for applications for treatments such as this, and we 
are sorry if the policy was not made clear to Mrs Pickstock at the 
time.'

Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham Tim Loughton is now investigating Marie's case.
