A U.S. state politician has apologised after sending suggestive and harassing messages to a married female lawyer he called a ‘sexxxy mama’.

Florida House Rep. Richard Steinberg, 39, sent dozens of messages last autumn to Assistant U.S. Attorney Marlene Fernandez-Karavetsos, 37.

The Miami Beach father-of-one has known the prosecutor for 15 years, but didn’t identify himself in the series of text messages, investigators said.

He admitted ‘sending inappropriate and unsolicited messages’ and said he ‘regrets’ disrespecting the woman, her husband and his constituents.

‘Words cannot express how sorry I am to my wife, for the disrespect I have shown her, and my entire family,’ he told the Miami Herald.

The messages were sent from a phone that disguised the number as ‘itsjustme24680’, but this was traced to Mr Steinberg’s internet account.

Democrat Mr Steinberg faces up to a year in prison if he is convicted of stalking, but he has not yet been charged, reported the Miami Herald.

Prosecutor: Marlene Fernandez-Karavetsos, left, works in general litigation for the U.S. Attorney in Miami and is married to George Karavetsos, 39

Mrs Fernandez-Karavetsos works in general litigation for the U.S. Attorney in Miami and is married to federal prosecutor George Karavetsos, 39.

She told investigators that she knows Mr Steinberg in a ‘professional non-intimate way’ and the messages caused ‘substantial emotional distress’, reported the Miami Herald.

In the messages he allegedly called Mrs Fernandez-Karavetsos a ‘sexxxy mama’ and asked: ‘How’s motherhood? Getting any sleep?’

When asked to identify himself he allegedly replied: ‘Considering we're both married parents, probably best I (don’t) answer that.’

Mr Steinberg accessed an 'itsjustme24680' account on his home computer in South Beach and another at work in Miami Beach, investigators said.

Detectives are now investigating whether inappropriate messages were sent to other women by Mr Steinberg, reported the Miami Herald.
