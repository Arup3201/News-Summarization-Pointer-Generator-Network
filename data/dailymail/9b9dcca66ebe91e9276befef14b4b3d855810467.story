A Christian family of four brutally beat a man and dumped his bloody body in the woods to be eaten by wolves, prosecutors have said.

Raymond Jones, 45, his wife April, 38, their son Justin Bey, 21 and his fianc√©e Samantha McClellan, 18, have been charged with attempted first degree intentional homicide, among other charges.

The family allegedly beat the unnamed man, 40, at the Jones' house in Wabeno, Wisconsin on March 10 and 11 before hauling him to nearby snow-covered woods and beating him again.

The man was a friend of April Jones and had been staying at the family's home for three weeks when they accused him of hitting one of their young children on the behind.

'Cruel': Raymond Jones and his wife April, both pictured, have been arrested for allegedly beating a friend for two days before dumping his body in the snow-covered woods to be eaten by wolves

'Plot': Their son Justin Bey and his fiancee Samantha McClellan, both pictured, allegedly joined in with the beating - which also including urinating on the man and wiping feces on his head

For two days, the family allegedly assaulted the man with sticks, punched and kicked him in the crotch, according to a criminal complaint, as reported by WSAW.

Among the brutal treatment, the man was allegedly urinated on and had feces wiped on his head.

Raymond Jones, a firefighter who belongs to a Christian motorcycle association, said it was 'the 
worst he had ever seen anyone beat', according to the complaint.

The group told investigators they left him in the woods where they hoped wolves would attack him because of the blood he had lost, the complaint filed in Forest County Circuit Court said.

Scene: The 40-year-old man was staying with the family at their home in Wabeno, Wisconsin (pictured) when he hit one of their children on the behind - sparking the two-day brutal beating

Found: He was dumped in these snow-covered woods and found by two ATV riders, who thought he was dead. He suffered broken bones - including his nose and jaw - and frostbite

But two people on ATV vehicles were riding in the woods on March 12 when they came across what they thought was a suitcase - before realizing it was a man doubled over.

They thought the man, who was covered in blood, wearing one shoe and with his pants down to his ankles, was dead until he started making to speak.

They hauled him on the back of their vehicle and took him to a nearby convenience store, where they called 911.

He sustained fractures to his face, a broken nose and jaw, and two broken ribs as well as frostbite all over his body, according to the complaint.

He was expected 
to have a leg and the other foot amputated, WLUK reported.

On finding out he had survived the ordeal, McClellan was reportedly upset.

Charged: Raymond Jones, pictured left in his Christian Motorcyclists Association jacket, and his wife April face charges of first degree intentional homicide, and Mr Jones faces strangulation charges

The four suspects are charged with attempted 1st degree intentional homicide, false imprisonment, two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a child, kidnapping, and aggravated battery.

Raymond Jones is also charged with strangulation.

According to their Facebook pages, Raymond Jones is part of the Christian Motorcyclists Association and his wife is also a Christian. Together they appear to have two children.

Both Jones and Bey are in the fire service, according to their profiles.

The man's name is being withheld because he is the victim of an alleged crime.
