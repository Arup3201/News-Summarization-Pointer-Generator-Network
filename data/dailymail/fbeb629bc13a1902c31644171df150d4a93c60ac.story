Here's one turkey that definitely doesn't vote for Christmas.

Colditz the Christmas turkey could have graced the Royal family's dinner table this year - but instead he decided to make a run for it.

After being loaded onto an abattoir-bound lorry in North Wales, the organically-bred bird managed to give farmer Gareth Williams the slip when part of the back door became unlatched.

Unfortunately for the fleeing turkey, his escape route ended in the garden of the farmer's mother-in-law who found him outside her front door.

Bird with plenty of pluck: Colditz the turkey courageously jumped from an abattoir-bound lorry in North Wales

Gareth Williams, who works at the farm on the Rhug Estate in North Wales, was left baffled when he discovered he was one turkey down on arrival at the slaughterhouse

However, Mr Williams, 52, was so impressed by the bird's escape that he decided it to spare it from the chop, calling it Colditz in recognition of its daring escape.

The farmer, who works at the farm on the Rhug Estate in Corwen - where Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall source their Christmas turkeys - was left baffled when he discovered he was one turkey down on arrival at the slaughterhouse.

The poultry farmer said: 'I was obviously shocked to see the door was open and then unfortunately had to deal with all the paper work.

'It is 70 miles to the abattoir so I didn't expect to see the turkey again. I was just thankful that only one of the birds had managed to escape.'

But Colditz didn't disappear. In fact he turned up in the village of Llangollen, near the home of Mr Williams's mother-in-law, Pam Owen.

Mr Williams said: 'I got a phonecall from my mother-in-law, Pam, and she said that a turkey had been found in the village.

Stay of execution: The organically bred turkey was destined for Christmas dinner but managed to flee when a part of the truck door became unlatched

When the farmer thought his turkey was gone forever, the Colditz wandered into his mother-in-law's garden and was recaptured

'I said "well that's a coincidence as I am missing one". They had heard it pecking around their courtyard and even on the front door.'

Mr Williams travelled to his in-laws and took the turkey back to the farm where hundreds of turkeys are bred for Christmas every year.

Lord Newborough with Colditz the turkey named after the Nazi prison camp his owner's father was interned in

Owner of the Rhug Estate, Lord Newborough, found the turkey's escape attempt hilarious - and helped decide the name of the intrepid bird.

He said: 'The turkey has become a bit of a mascot for the Rhug organic farm and he should be safe from this Christmas.

'My
father escaped a Nazi prison camp in World War Two but was captured and
sent to Colditz, so we thought that would be a fitting name for the 
turkey. '

The previous Lord 
Newborough, Michael Wynn, was held at the infamous Nazi prisoner of war 
camp for the final two years of the Second World War.

Michael
Wynn was an officer in the Royal Navy and in 1942 played a decisive 
role in the destruction of the German held port at Saint-Nazaire, 
Western France.

He died in 
1998 but his son Robert, the current Lord Newborough, is glad to pass on
a memory of him to the new Rhug estate celebrity.

Colditz
may be safe from Christmas but his counterparts will be heading to the 
Connaught hotel in Mayfair, Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir cookery school and
even to the table of the Royal family.
