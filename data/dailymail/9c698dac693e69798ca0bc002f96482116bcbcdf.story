The brother of a man accused of kidnapping and killing Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo in 2011 now has been charged with raping her.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said Tuesday that John Dylan Adams, 26, has been indicted on two counts of raping Ms Bobo, whose partial remains were found last month in Decatur County.

Adams had already been charged with tampering with evidence in the case of Bobo, who was reported missing on April 13, 2011.

New charges: John Dylan Adams, 26, was charged with two counts of rape after he admitted to sexually assaulting Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo 

According to TBI, Adams admitted that he was involved in the forcible rape of the 20-year-old nursing student on his family's property in Holladay, Tennessee, the day she vanished.

Police are now looking into allegations that there is a video recording out there showing Holly Bobo tied up after her kidnapping.

Adams is being held without bond and has a hearing set for October 22.

A cousin of the Admas brothers responded to the new allegations against Dylan Adams by claiming that the 26-year-old has the IQ of a 10-year-old and was likely coerced by investigators into making a confession.

'We are under the impression, in his mental state, he could be coerced to say anything,' Moss Miller told The Jackson Sun. 'I would be reluctant to think that this is true.'

The 26-year-old suspect is the younger brother of Zachary Adams, 30, who has pleaded not guilty to murder and kidnapping charges in the case.

Another man, Jason Autry, faces the same charges as Zachary Adams. Both men have pleaded not guilty. 

TBI agents believe that on April 13, 2011, John Dylan Adams disposed of items he knew to be of evidentiary value to the case, according to a statement released after his arrest last month. . 

This past April, Zach Adams was charged with coercion of a witness. The warrant in that incident states that the murder suspect instructed an unnamed inmate: 'Tell my brother he is the one who started this (expletive), and if he don't shut his mouth he will be in the hole beside her.'

Zach Adam's criminal history contains charges dating back to 2009 including several 
drug violations as well as aggravated burglary and theft.

Jason Autry, 39, has been indicted with especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree felony murder.

He is already in prison serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault. 

The
 case of Bobo's disappearance is still active. Prosecutors are 
considering seeking the death penalty if they get a conviction. 

Loss: Nursing student Holly Bobo was seen being led from her Tennessee home in April 2011

Closure: Holly Bobo's partial remains were found last month near Adams family property 

Brothers Jeffrey Pearcy and Mark Pearcy were arrested in May and charged with tampering with evidence and accessory after the fact, after a woman named Sandra King told authorities that Jeffrey had showed her a cellphone video of Bobo tied up and crying. 

In the wake of Miss Bobo's 
disappearance, her brother told police that he saw a man dressed in 
camouflage leading her away into the woods.

She had been preparing to go to class at nursing school on the morning of her disappearance.

The
 director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said the Bobo case has been the most expensive and exhaustive in TBI history,
 and it's not over yet.

In September, two
 men found a skull not far from property owned by the Adams family.  

Threats: Adams appears in court earlier this year over claims he threatened his brother, who is a witness in the case

Suspect: Jason Wayne Autry has been charged with the kidnap and murder of Holly Bobo

TBI director Mark Gwyn previously said the agency has sworn statements from witnesses who claim to have seen Bobo alive with Autry and Adams after she had been reported missing. 

Gwynn added that they also had physical evidence being analyzed at two crime laboratories, and several witnesses. 

'We believe other individuals have knowledge, and possibly others have involvement,' Mr Gwyn told News Channel 5.

'They can expect us to be on their doorsteps very soon.'

He
 added: 'This is a case the TBI has been continuously working hard to 
solve now for three years. It has not been easy but I do know truth will
 prevail.' 

'Anyone who had anything to do with Holly's disappearance will be brought to justice,' he added.
