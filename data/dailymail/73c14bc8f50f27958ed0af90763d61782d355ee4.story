Named after former U.S. President Bill Clinton, a Ugandan boy who was held by the politician as a baby has met him again, 14 years on.

While he was president, Clinton visited a village in Uganda in 1998 to meet the baby boy named after him because he was born in the same month that the president first arrived in Uganda.

Now a teenager, the Ugandan boy, whose full name is Master Bill Clinton Kaligani, was delighted to meet the former president again last Friday.

The boy was flown to Entebbe, Uganda to have lunch with Clinton and according to AllAfrica.com, Bill had to miss an exam to keep his lunch date with the man he said has had such an impact on his life.

According to Ugandan newspaper Daily 
Monitor he said: ‘I feel good. He told me he also wanted me to be a 
doctor, that I should work hard and pass in my studies.’

The two Bill Clintons meet: While on a trip to Africa in 1998, the former president met his namesake in a Ugandan village. The baby was named after the then president because he was born in the same month that the president first arrived in Uganda

Supporting Uganda: Since his visit in 1998 where he visited the Kisowera school, Clinton has supported various initiatives to better African children's education and health

His mother Betty Namugosa said: ‘(Clinton) was very happy to see the boy. He asked him what he wants and the boy informed him he wants to become a doctor. 

‘He promised to look after his “son” in every way.’

Through his foundation, Clinton has supported and set up various initiatives to support education, the provision of hearing aids and averting childhood deaths due to diarrhoea.

In April, his wife Hillary Clinton visited South Africa in her capacity as Secretary of State.

She met with foreign minister Maite 
Nkoana-Mashabane and the pair hosted a joint press conference where Mrs 
Clinton said that through the various American-sponsored relief 
programs, they have been able to save 'hundreds of thousands of lives' 
in the country.

They also attended a business summit where economic incentives were analysed for possible ways to expand growth in the region. 

In keeping with the friendly nature of the visit, Mrs Clinton paid a visit to former South African president Nelson Mandela.
