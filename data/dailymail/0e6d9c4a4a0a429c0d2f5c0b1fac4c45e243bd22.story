Justin Bieber has launched a Twitter tirade against his critics and told fans he is only judged by one power - God.

The 19-year-old singer posted a series of messages to the social networking site speaking out about his partying, relationships and his religion.

Justin denied allegations of his recent bad behaviour and said that he didn't have to answer to anyone and wrote: 'im only judged by one power, and i serve him.' (sic)

Religious: Justin Bieber has gone on an angry Twitter tirade slamming his critics and said he is only judged by God. He later went out in London wearing his bizarre gas mask

After he had voiced his opinions to his 35million followers Bieber headed out on the town in London wearing his bizarre gas mask.

The singer was seen heading to Mr Chows restaurant in the unusual head piece and he had his cream jumper pulled up around his face.

The singer, who was two hours late for his debut concert at the 02 arena, started his rant with the message: 'rumors rumors and more rumors. nothing more nothing less. might talk about them 1 day. rt now im just gonna be positive. cant bring me down'. (sic)

He added: 'We know the truth as long as 
my family, friends, and fans r with me u can say whatever. we are all 
equal in God's eyes & we have a responsibility to each other. (sic)

Justin also made reference to Ella-Paige Roberts Clarke, who he has been spending considerable amounts of time with during his stay in the UK.

He said: 'Any girl i stand next to is my girl or that i dont care, or that i dont feel, or that a 19 year old going to a club in europe is wild.'(sic)

Someone looks a bit silly don't they? Justin emerged from his car and ran into the restaurant ducking down and flanked by his bodyguards on Wednesday night

What does he look like: The revolving door proved tricky for Justin to negotiate given his limited vision from the gas mask

While he played down his partying just hours later the singer headed to 45 Park Lane to continue his evening after a meal at Mr Chows.

Justin's rant comes after claims that the reason for Justin's tardiness on Monday was because he threw a 'massive tantrum'.

According to backstage sources Justin was
in a foul mood after waking up late because of a night out and the 
'stroppy youngster locked himself in his dressing room to play computer 
games'.

Despite
being accused of coming onstage two hours after he was billed to, with 
hundreds of upset teenagers leaving before getting the chance to see 
their idol, Justin said he was only 40 minutes late on Monday - blaming 
technical difficulties and saying the gig was 'great'.

Gamer: Justin Bieber was apparently two hours late to his show on Monday because he was playing video games and woke up late

One O2 worker, who did not want to be named, told The Sun: 'He was arguing with members of his management, his family. It was a really uncomfortable atmosphere. His attitude was, "I’m the star and I can do what I want"'.

Another worker, Ellie Grace, said: 'I hope I never have to experience so many upset children and disappointed fans again.'

Speaking to Heat magazine, an insider said the 19-year old refused to go onstage before showering, despite desperate pleas from his management to perform.

Tardy: Despite fans complaining, Bieber still maintains he was only 40 minutes late to stage

Curious: Wearing two expensive watches it's a wonder how Justin couldn't see he was late to his own concert

Another backstage source added: 'His 
lateness was because he didn’t get out of bed until late and sat in his 
dressing room playing games - even though his door was being knocked.'

'He then threw a strop as he said he wanted a shower first, despite already being late.'

It is thought Justin arrived at the O2 arena at 3pm 'to do some meet and greets' but he 
was suffering after a ' heavy night at his hotel.

But the great audience at the O2 weren't the only ones to be disappointed.

A
15-year old fan - who did not want to be named for fear of backlash 
from the Belieber community - was 'blanked' by her musical hero even 
though she had won a competition to meet him before the show.

The unhappy girl told Heat that she and her friends, waited for three hours to see Justin.

However, when their idol finally arrived, they say he spent 'less than ten seconds' with him.

She also claims the singer declined to give her a hug, ironically telling his fan 'I don't have time.'

A source close to Justin said: 'There was no competition winner that we knew or approved of.'

'If it was a radio contest winner who got a meet and greet, they got the same amount of time as everyone else and exactly what was promised.'

The rest of the accounts are 'wildly exaggerated or just untrue.'

Even an O2 staff member witnessed 
Justin's alleged diva-like behaviour:

'He was arguing with members of 
his management, his family. It was a really uncomfortable atmosphere.

His attitude was, "I’m the star and I can do what I want".'

Despite
a wealth of attendees confirming his two hour delay to stage, the 
Canadian star still maintains he only kept his fans waiting for 40 
minutes.

Still popular: Justin Bieber was presented with an official Wembley Way 
Stone this week after playing the stadium last year, causing his fans to record 
the loudest scream during the Capital FM Summertime Ball

'Last night i was scheduled after 3 opening acts to go on stage at 935 
not 830 but because of some technical issues i got on at 10:10..so...(sic)' the singer tweeted.

Digital Spy also reported that the star is being asked to pay a £300,000 fine to Greenwich Council for causing the gig to run past the 11pm closing time.

However, a Royal Borough of Greenwich spokesperson said: '[We] have not taken any action against the owners of The O2 in relation to Justin Bieber’s recent performance, as no breach of our licensing conditions took place.'

Poser: Justin visited Wembley Stadium on Monday to be honoured with his official Wembley Way Stone following his loudest scream recorded at a concert there last year

'I never have any intent to upset or let anyone down. and Im not okay 
with things being exaggerated. once again sorry for anyone upset.(sic)'

But to ensure the backlash didn't 
continue, the following night's performance saw Justin arrive on stage 
two minutes early, according to his official Twitter page.

However
it seems the furore hasn't dampened the Girlfriend's singer's feelings 
towards the English capital, tweeting a simple message in the early 
hours of Wednesday: 'Lovin London. #goodtimes'.

And Bieber's popularity doesn't seem to be waning completely either.

The Baby hitmaker was presented with his very own Wembley Way Stone this week ahead of his London concerts.

Justin met up with The FA team and headed to Wembley on Monday, where he was inducted into the Wembley Way walk of fame after his performance at last summer’s Capital FM Summertime Ball.

Bieber will now be immortalised with a Wembley Way Stone having rocked the stadium last year causing his fans to raise the roof at the national stadium with the loudest scream recorded at the venue.

Justin said: 'Thank you to Wembley Stadium for presenting me with my official Wembley Way Stone!  Such an honour to be part of Wembley history, and thank you to my amazing UK Beliebers for helping me put on an incredible show last year!'

The pop sensation becomes the second Capital FM Summertime Ball act to be honoured on Wembley Way; he follows Coldplay who were also given a Wembley Stone having been voted as Wembley Stadiums Greatest Moment of the Year for 2012.
