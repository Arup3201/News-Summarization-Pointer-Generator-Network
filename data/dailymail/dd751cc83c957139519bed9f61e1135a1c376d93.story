NBC analyst Roger Maltbie's golf cart driver has been charged with assault after running over a highway patrol officer at the US Open Championships, officials said yesterday.

Driver Thomas Lineberry allegedly refused to stop on the tee when ordered by a North Carolina Highway Patrolman, before driving over the officer's foot at Pinehurst Golf Course yesterday.

Incredible photographs show Trooper R. A. Goodin chasing after the buggy before leaping on the back, gripping the 59-year-old driver's neck and shoulders from behind.

Maltbie ran to the aid of his friend and colleague as he was handcuffed.

'This is a new one,' Maltbie said, as he walked down the 11th fairway. 'I’ve been to a couple of rodeos and a county fair and I’ve never had this happen.'

The bizarre incident occurred as US Open leader Martin Kaymer teed off on the 11th hole and the trooper was holding traffic behind a walkway.

Trooper Goodin allegedly told Lineberry, whose job was to drive Maltbie around the course, to stay put. He refused.

An Associated Press reporter who witnessed the incident heard Lineberry tell a trooper, 'I'm supposed to get the cart to Roger.'

A trooper, just inches from Lineberry's face, responded: 'When a state trooper tells you to stop, 
THAT'S what you're supposed to do'.

Another officer, Trooper C.A. Smith, arrested Lineberry. He reportedly asked for the names of 
witnesses, and three people in the gallery immediately handed him their 
business cards.

Lineberry was taken to Moore County jail and charged with felony assault on a law enforcement officer; felony hit and run; driving while impaired; and resist, obstruct and delay, according
 to North Carolina Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Pam Walker.

She said a magistrate gave Lineberry a $3,000 secured bond. He posted bond Saturday night.

Trooper Ryan A. Goodin was treated at the SHP medical trailer for a minor leg injury and released.

Walker said Trooper Goodin is assigned to the Statesville Office and has been one of approximately 170 troopers assisting with security at the U.S. Open Championships.

Dan Higgins, a spokesman for NBC's Golf Channel, told fayobserver.com late Saturday the broadcasting company had not seen the incident report and had no comment.
