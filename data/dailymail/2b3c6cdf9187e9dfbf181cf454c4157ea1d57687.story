Sadio Mane scored the winning goal for Southampton against Stoke. It was his second goal in as many weeks for the Saints, here Sportsmail gives the lowdown on the Senegal midfielder.

Who is he?

A fleet-footed wide player signed by Ronald Koeman for £11.8 million on deadline day to help mitigate the mass player exodus at Southampton.

What’s his story?

Born in Sedhiou, Senegal, on April 10 1992, Mane joined French side Metz’s famous academy in 2011. The promising youngster transferred to Red Bull Salzburg in 2012, where he scored 29 league goals in two seasons, before electing to join Koeman’s Saints revolution after Salzburg were eliminated from the Champions League.

Type of player?

Despite being right-footed, Mane’s preferred position is on the left, where he utilises his blistering pace and deceptive strength to good effect - as Phil Bardsley discovered on Saturday. His ability to swing crosses in from the byline on his left foot, combined with a proficiency in front of goal when cutting in on his right, make him very difficult to defend against.
