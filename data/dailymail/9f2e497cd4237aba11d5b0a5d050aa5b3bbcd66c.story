A babysitter who was charged with having sex with two underage boys two years ago will be spared jail time.

Loni Bouchard, 22, of Clinton, Connecticut, was sentenced Thursday to three years in prison, but her sentence was suspended and she was instead given two years of probation, the Hartford Courant reports.

It helped her case that the family of one of her victims - who was 14 at the time of the charges - supported the no-jail sentence, Judge David P. Gold said.

Under her probation, she is barred from any contact with boys who are under the age of 16.

She is also barred from contacting her victims.

'I'm
really sorry to the victim and their families,' Bouchard, who was 19 at
the time of the relationships, said. 'This will never happen again.'

She had previously pleaded guilty to three counts of first-degree reckless endangerment.

In
her journal, which was acquired by police, Bouchard wrote that she knew 
her relationship with the first victim - whom she had been hired to 
babysit - was against the law but did not believe the law had the right 
to tell her who she could and couldn't love.

She
wrote about the 'amazing' sex she had with the boy, how much she loved 
him and wondered why the five-year age gap even mattered.

It
also emerged that her mother, Kimmie Bouchard, 46, supplied the boy 
with marijuana and alcohol when he visited their Southington home. Kimmi
Bouchard pleaded guilty to risk of injury and received probation.

The
victim's mother learned of the relationship with the younger Bouchard 
through a Facebook message she intercepted and reported her to police 
and got a restraining order.

Babysitter's seduction: Loni Bouchard had a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old boy who she was hired to look after

Bouchard had written in her diary about how much she missed him and how unfair it was they couldn't see each other.

She
wrote: 'I have finally found the guy who treats me right and makes me 
so happy and I can't be with him because the law says so?

'I
don't care about the law. I just want to be with him and not have to 
hide it. How can the law tell us who to fall for, who to like and who to
love and especially who to date? I thought America was a free country'.

She
also reportedly sent the boy's parents text messages after they found 
out about the affair, asking if they could 'work this out'.

She also told them they 'don't need to call the police' and 'let's act like adults'.

The boy's parents filed a restraining order against Miss Bouchard in May.

Around
that time, she wrote in her journal: ‘His mom absolutely HATES me 
because of the situation and I understand why, but she's being immature 
about it.’

She also wrote that she was cutting herself and used a bracelet the boy gave her to cover the scratches.

In
a separate notebook seized from her home, police found letters written 
to the boy, where Miss Bouchard said she was upset his parents had filed
the restraining order, and missed waking up next to him.

She
was also involved with another underage boy - also 14 - from 
Southington. His parents did not allow him to speak with police 
investigators.

According to the Hartford Courant, bouchard met the boy she claimed to have been in love with at a summer campground in Salem.
