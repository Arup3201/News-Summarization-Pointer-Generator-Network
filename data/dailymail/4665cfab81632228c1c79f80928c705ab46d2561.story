Manchester United defender Alex Buttner is in talks over a move to Dinamo Moscow.

The Dutch left-back is due to have a medical in the coming days as the clubs agree a fee.

United manager Louis van Gaal is keeping Patrice Evra and remains keen on Luke Shaw but has other options if Southampton fail to agree on the fee.

Javier Hernandez is wanted by the south coast club as part of the deal but Saints manager Ronald Koeman also likes Graziano Pelle at Feyenoord. Hernandez is also courting interest from Valencia and Inter Milan.

Buttner told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf: 'Van Gaal never gave me the chance in the Dutch national team, despite being voted man of the match 14 times at Manchester United. 

'Apparently he is not very confident about me. So I think this is the right moment to leave.'

Buttner’s agent Alexander Bursac admits remaining at Old Trafford is not really feasible.

'In the past two years, Louis van Gaal has ignored Buttner time after time so what kind of perspective does he have when Van Gaal becomes his new club coach?' he told Voetbal International.

'Patrice Evra signed a new contract and with Luke Shaw they want to buy another player for Buttner’s position.

'To stay at Manchester United was not an option for Buttner. Dinamo Moscow has great plans for the future and they want to challenge for the title.'
