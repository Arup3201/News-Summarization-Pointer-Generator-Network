Sales of Pippa Middleton's debut book haven't exactly been soaring since the socialite launched the party guide in a blaze of publicity back in October.

So now it seems Kate's little sister is spreading her wings and hoping for a bit more literary success across the channel.

Today Pippa arrived in Amsterdam to launch the Dutch edition of Celebrate: A Year of Festivities for Family and Friends and chose an eye-popping Cadbury-purple Beulah London dress to ensure maximum publicity for her entertaining 'bible'.

Pippa met with booksellers at a private Christmas drinks party to mark the launch of the Dutch edition of her book and posed for photographers outside the event in a Cadbury-coloured satin dress featuring a pelmet detail.

29-year-old Pippa teamed the smart block-coloured dress with purple suede court shoes and wore her hair pulled back in a simple up 'do.

Meanwhile, back on British soil UK booksellers today slashed the price of the book - some by up to 75% - as they try to sell enough copies to make some money from the much-hyped book in time for Christmas.

High street stationery giants WHSmith are now selling the book for £6.25, even though its original cost was £25.

A spokesperson for WHSmith said of the price of the book: 'We have got 
an up to 75 per cent-off promotion at the moment, and it is just one of 
the many hardback books that are part of that offer.'

Pippa was rumoured to have been given
an advance of £400,000 for the book by publishers Penguin but the guide
- featuring tips on chilling drinks and making tea - has been blasted 
by critics and is currently languishing at 353 in online retailer 
Amazon's bestselling chart.

Novelist Jilly Cooper recently described the book as 'terrible' and claimed bosses at Penguin were 'slitting their wrists'.

She
said: 'The sales have been dreadful, and I hear that the people at 
Penguin are virtually slitting their wrists over it. To think of all the
money they spent on it, too.

'I don't blame her - I think that she was ill-advised.'

High hopes: Pippa Middleton and family leave Daunt Books in Fulham Road after her book launch in October
