Two Al Jazeera journalists being held in an Egyptian jail are set to go on trial again later this week after spending more than 400 days in prison.

Baher Mohamed, an Egyptian national and Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy, were sentenced to between seven and 10 years in jail last year on charges including spreading lies to help a terrorist organisation - a reference to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.

They were arrested along with Australian journalist Peter Greste in Cairo on December 29, as they covered the aftermath of the army’s removal of Mohamed Morsi from the presidency in July 2013.

Last week Mr Greste was freed by order of Egypt's president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, under a new law that allows foreign prisoners to be deported.

However, his two colleagues remain in prison and today one of the men's lawyers confirmed that their retrial would be on Thursday.

Mostafa Nagy, a lawyer for Mr Mohamed said: 'The session has been set for February 12, 2015. It is the new session for the retrial. Al Jazeera English also reported the date on its website.

Last week, there had been reports that Mr Fahmy was due to be imminently released from prison after reportedly relinquishing his Egyptian citizenship in exchange for his freedom.

John Baird, Canada's foreign minister, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation he expected Fahmy's release, but gave no specific timing.

However, his finacee said today that she had no information about his possible release.

Egyptian authorities accuse Qatar-based Al Jazeera of being a mouthpiece of the Brotherhood -- the movement the army removed from power in 2013. Al Jazeera denies the allegations.

The journalists were detained in December 2013 and they say they were doing their jobs.

Their imprisonment reinforced the view of human rights groups that the government was rolling back freedoms gained after the 2011 uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak.

Baher Mohamed was given an extra three years for possessing a single bullet.

Upon his release last week, Mr Greste revealed it was traumatic leaving his colleagues behind in a Cairo prison and he didn't truly believe he was being freed until he was seated on a plane bound for Cyprus.

He used his first interview since being deported from Egypt to call on the country to his colleagues the Cairo bureau chief Mr Fahmy and Mr Mohamed, a producer.

'You spend 400 days in such close proximity with people and you really get to know them very, very well,' the 49-year-old told Al Jazeera in Cyprus on Monday.

'So it was a very difficult moment walking out of that prison, saying goodbye to those guys, not knowing how much longer they will have to put up with this.'

Meanwhile prominent lawyer Amal Clooney has requested a meeting with Egypt's president to push for the release of Al-Jazeera reporter Mohamed Fahmy, a letter obtained by AFP on Saturday shows.

Mrs Clooney, who married Hollywood star George Clooney last year, has thrown her legal clout and celebrity behind Mr Fahmy to secure his release.

Rights groups and several media outlets condemned the verdicts as political, saying the three were doing their job during a tumultuous time.

According to a law passed late last year, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has the power to deport foreign defendants or convicts if it's considered to be in the interest of national security. The law was seen as providing a potential legal instrument with which to free the journalists.
