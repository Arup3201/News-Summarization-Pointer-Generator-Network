A teenage girl, whose police officer parents are accused of killing her boyfriend, has been left stunned by the murder of the 'sweet and caring' young man.

Lisa Kepler, 18, turned her parents in after she allegedly watched her father shoot her new boyfriend, 19-year-old Jeremy Lake, dead in a Tulsa street, Oklahoma.

Miss Kepler said that her father had never met her boyfriend, whom she had known for a week and described as a 'protective and good person'.

The girl has not spoken to her parents, Shannon Kepler, 54, and Gina Kepler, 48, since they were arrested. 

Jeremy Lake, 19, was shot dead on Tuesday night 

Her father, who has served the police force for 24 years, is facing a first-degree murder charge while her mother was arrested on a complaint of accessory to murder after the fact.

The officers were off-duty at the time of the shooting.  

Miss Kepler sobbed as she told NBC: 'Josh is the kindest person. 

'He is the most protective person and a good person who helped the homeless. I don't know why my dad did this.'

She said that she tried to call the jail where her father was being held to ask him why he committed such a brutal act. 

The 18-year-old revealed that her parents had kicked her out of home last week and that she met Mr Lake who was volunteering at the shelter where she had been staying. 

He offered her a place to stay at the home he shared with his aunt, Miss Kepler said.

The young couple were walking to Mr Lake's aunt's house on Tuesday when her father turned up in his car. She said that he asked what she was doing in the neighborhood.

When she walked away, the 19-year-old tried to introduce himself. 

The police officer then shot Lake two or three times, fled in his vehicle and later turned himself in, the affidavit said. 

Miss Kepler described Mr Lake to NBC as 'my everything'. 

She told Tulsa World: ‘I really hope they rot in prison for a very long time.’

Shannon Kepler's lawyer Richard O'Carroll said that the officer plans to plead not guilty as he has a 'viable, if not perfect' defense.

The husband and wife were booked on Tuesday night into the Tulsa County jail. They are being held without bail pending the filing of formal charges and have both been placed on paid administrative leave.

Shannon Kepler is due to be arraigned on Tuesday.

Jeremy Lake was shot dead on Tuesday night on a street near downtown, Tulsa police department spokeswoman Jillian Roberson said. 

Lisa Kepler started to run and was shot at but the bullet missed, Ms Robertson also said. The spokeswoman said that it is a 'very difficult case' for the police department but that it was being treated like any other murder inquiry.

Police Chief Chuck Jordan said in a statement that ‘the circumstances around this incident drives home the fact that domestic violence is a societal problem and transcends all economic groups'.

‘I as well as the whole department am saddened for both families involved in this tragic event,’ Chief Jordan said.

Roberson did not immediately return a message late on Wednesday seeking clarification on what Jordan meant in reference to domestic violence.
