Health officials investigating a cluster of mysterious illnesses in Alabama closed their investigation on Thursday after determining the illnesses were unrelated and were caused by the same viruses that cause flu.

The investigation involved 10 people who became sick and were admitted to hospitals in Dothan and Luverne in southeast Alabama.

Two died, six remained hospitalized Thursday, and two had been released, state Health Officer Don Williamson said. The 10 range in age from 24 to 87.

A cluster of mysterious respiratory illnesses that alarmed southeast Alabama turned out to be nothing more sinister than ordinary cold and seasonal flu

Williamson said health officials took
extraordinary caution due to the emergence of two viruses, including 
the new H7NP, in other countries.

Southeast Alabama is home to a military base and several aircraft plants that have frequent international travel

'We looked extremely hard. This represents the way the system is supposed to work,' Williamson said.

Testing at a state lab and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed different groups of pathogens were present.

Four of the patients had a rhinovirus, the same family of germs that causes the common cold.

Three had bacterial-based pneumonia and others had influenza A and H1N1.

All seven adults had been admitted to hospitals with symptoms including fever, cough and shortness of breath

Although it was not known whether the
sufferers had gotten flu shots, the types of illnesses that were 
contracted were covered by this year's vaccine.

Williamson said the flu pandemic of 2008-09 showed that flu cases are present in Alabama throughout the year.

It is uncommon, but not unheard of, for small outbreaks to occur in the spring and summer, he said.

Mysterious illnesses are always unnerving, but the cluster report came at a particularly sensitive time.

Health officials have been monitoring
two deadly new illnesses that recently surfaced in different parts of 
the world - one a deadly form of bird flu that has appeared in China, 
the other a SARS-like coronavirus that seems to have originated in the 
Middle East.

The bird flu has caused 131 illnesses
and 32 deaths since the beginning of the year, according to the World 
Health Organization.

The SARS-like virus (called MERS) has been identified as the cause of 44 illnesses, including 22 deaths, the WHO said.

Neither seems to be highly contagious so far, and neither illness has been reported in the United States.

But in a world of daily international
air travel, it's always possible that a new germ of concern will 
hitchhike on an infected globetrotter and enter this country.

The CDC tested the Alabama patients 
for MERS, for different forms of flu and for more than a dozen other 
illnesses, the agency spokeswoman said.

Dr. Mary McIntyre, head of infectious
diseases for the state public health agency, said the precautions taken
by Alabama were worthwhile.

She said using the same protocol, a 
pediatrician in north Alabama last year observed a new Coxsackie virus, a
type of hand, foot and mouth disease in children.

By identifying the new strain, the disease was able to be slowed and children treated in other states.
