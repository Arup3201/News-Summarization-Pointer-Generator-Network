Archaeologists more accustomed to unearthing coins and jewels during digs have discovered a 2,000-year old wooden toilet seat.

While the artefact is less glamorous, it is perfectly preserved and incredibly rare because it is thought to be the only seat of its kind used by the Romans to have survived.

The toilet seat was discovered at Vindolanda fort on Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland and could have been used by soldiers stationed at the border whose job it was to keep the barbarians at bay.

Archaeologists used to unearthing treasure such as coins and jewels have discovered a 2,000-year old wooden toilet seat. It is thought to be the only set made of wood that has survived since Roman times

Dr Andrew Birley, director of excavations at the fort, has previously dug up gold and silver or artefacts which relate to the military might of the Roman army, as well as everyday items like letters, shoes and babies' booties.

He made the discovery himself in a muddy trench which was previously filled with historic rubbish and thinks the wood survived because mud was packed tightly around it, providing oxygen-free conditions.

There are many examples of stone and marble toilet benches from across the Roman Empire but this is believed to be the only surviving wooden seat - perhaps preferred to a cold stone material given the chilly northern location loathed by many Roman soldiers.

Vinolanda was a Roman fort south of Hadrian's Wall in northern England.

It guarded the Roman road from the River Tyne to Solway Firth.

Wooden tablets were discovered there which are considered the most important examples of military and private correspondence found anywhere in the Roman Empire.

The garrison was home to auxiliary infantry and cavalry units - not parts of Roman legions.

Roman boots, shoes, armours, jewellery, coins and tablets have all been found there.

In 2006, a richly-decorated silver brooch featuring the figure of Mars was found.

It belonged to Quintus Sollonius, a Gaul, whose name was inscribed on the brooch. 

It was dumped near the fort which predates Hadrian's Wall, which was constructed from the early second century.

‘There is always great excitement when you find something that has never been seen before and this discovery is wonderful,’ Dr Birley said.

‘We know a lot about Roman toilets from previous excavations at the site and from the wider Roman world which have included many fabulous Roman latrines but never before have we had the pleasure of seeing a surviving and perfectly preserved wooden seat.

‘As soon as we started to uncover it there was no doubt at all on what we had found. It is made from a very well worked piece of wood and looks pretty comfortable.

‘Now we need to find the toilet that went with it as Roman loos are fascinating places to excavate - their drains often contain astonishing artefacts.

‘Let's face it, if you drop something down a Roman latrine you are unlikely to attempt to fish it out unless you are pretty brave or foolhardy.’

The toilet seat will go on show at the fort’s museum once it has been preserved.

Archaeologists hope to locate the actual toilet in the hope that treasures were accidentally dropped inside it - and are lying undiscovered
