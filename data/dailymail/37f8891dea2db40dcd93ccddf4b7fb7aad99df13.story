Brazilian trio Neymar, David Luiz and Thiago Silva are among the finest footballers in world football and are equally as adept at boosting their following on social media networking website Instagram.

In fact six players in Luiz Felipe Scolari's squad are in the top 10 World Cup footballers with the largest amount of followers on the online photo-sharing service.

Barcelona superstar Neymar and Paris Saint-Germain duo Luiz and Silva are joined by fellow countryman Dani Alves, Marcelo and Hulk in the top 10.

Neymar, who has been one of the stars of the 2014 World Cup thus far, is currently leading the way with an incredible 7.3million followers on Instagram.

The 22-year-old's figures are made to look even better when they are compared to the second highest Brazilian in the top 10 charts - Luiz - who has attracted 2.4million followers.

Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, who is in second place behind Neymar, has 6million fans tracking his posts on the website which launched in October 2010.

Ronaldo's Real Madrid teammate Marcelo has posted a number of selfies during the past few weeks with his picture alongside Luiz and goalkeeper Julio Cesar the highlight of his reel of images.

Brazilian right-back Alves has for some reason chosen to post a selfie of himself with a bottle of milk, while Luiz and Fernandinho's underwater shots are particularly impressive.
