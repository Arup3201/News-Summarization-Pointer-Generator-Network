Researchers from the University of Illinois have discovered that Protestants who suppress sexual feelings and anger are more artistic and creative than Catholics and Jews

Protestants are more creative than Catholics and Jews, new research has found.

Researchers from the University of Illinois wanted to test a previously-held theory that introverted people who suppress emotions about sex and depravity are more creative than people who are more open and extroverted.

They discovered that Protestants, or people who grow up in a Protestant communities, can channel suppressed emotions more effectively than their Catholic and Jewish counterparts.

The research, led by Emily Kim along with Veronika Zeppenfeld and Dov Cohen, claims that its not that Jews and Catholics don't suppress the same feelings about sexual taboos as Protestants, but they channel it into feelings of guilt, rather than through art or creative means.

The team of researchers from Illinois began by analysing a Californian study by Freud and Weber that began in the 1920s, which wanted to test if there was a connection between high IQs, creativity and religion.

Freud and Weber interviewed participants when they were children and repeated these interviews over the following decades.

During the 1950s, the researchers asked specific questions about whether the participants
 had 'any 
major problems or marked difficulties related to sex', as well as being 
asked to list any creative accomplishments they had achieved.

Kim and her colleagues used these questions to conduct experiments on 127 'religious' men.

Of the participants, 60 were white Protestants, 40 were white Jews, 
and 27 were Latino Catholics.

The researchers said they excluded white Catholics because this group 'would be much more intermixed with, and 
influenced by, the wider Protestant culture'.

Some of the men were given a photo album and told to imagine the images in the album were members of their family.

One of the images of a sister-type figure showed an attractive woman in a bikini designed to make the participants feel sexually uncomfortable.

A second experiment involved participants being asked to write about their family before being told to create a clay sculpture and then write a poem.

The results found 
that 'Protestants produced more creative artwork (sculptures, poems, 
collages, cartoon captions) when they were primed with 
damnation-related words, induced to feel unacceptable sexual 
desires, or forced to suppress their anger.'

Researchers asked men of different religions to suppress their emotions, before being asked to sculpt or write a poem. Although Protestants were more creative, the study claims Catholics and Jews already have adequate ways to absolve guilt caused by these feelings, in confession booths, pictured, for example

Yet the researchers added that 
activating anger or sexual attraction wasn't enough to cause the 
creativity, and that these feelings had to be suppressed in one form or 
another to give 'the emotion its creative power.'

Kim et al said: 'Protestants who had major problems or marked difficulties related to 
sexual taboos and depravity anxieties showed greater creative 
achievements in their lives.

'They had more publications 
and creative accomplishments in other areas (and also) 
disproportionately chose jobs in the most creative occupations.

'Neither
 of these results held for Catholic and Jewish participants.'

The paper goes on to say that Protestant participants were more likely to include sexual and phallic symbols in their artwork, too.

During a third test, 42 Protestants and 54 Catholic or Jewish students were to told to focus on repressing anger.

Half of them were told to recall a time in their life when they had been 'very angry' and were asked to visualise how they wanted to hurt the person who had made them angry.

They were additionally told to make a fist with their hand while they wrote about the incident. 

The other half had to recall an event where they didn't feel overly happy, sad or angry.

Famous protestant artwork includes Hans Holbein the Younger's Noli me tangere, pictured, which is a rare Protestant oil painting of Jesus Christ

They were then told to create captions for five cartoons, which were later judged based on their wit and creativity.

Kim said: 'Without this suppression manipulation, Protestants in the other conditions scored about the same as Catholic and Jewish participants.'

One reason why the researchers believe the Catholics and Jews didn't show the same level of creative flair was because they 'seemed to show greater guilt reactions' during the tests.

The researchers said: 'Both Judaism and Catholicism have formal institutions and rituals that allow a person to atone for and repent one’s sins.

Alternatively, Protestants apparently don't have this method of channeling their anger and therefore needed a way 'to work through their forbidden emotions.'

The team of researchers from Illinois 
began by analysing a study by Sigmund Freud and Max Weber that began in the 1920s in
 California.

This study wanted to test if there was a connection between 
high IQs, religion and religion's role in creativity.

Freud and Weber interviewed 
participants when they were children, during the 1920s, and repeated 
these interviews over the following decades.

During the 1950s the researchers asked specific questions about whether they
 had 'any 
major problems or marked difficulties related to sex', as well as being 
asked to list any creative accomplishments they had achieved. 

This was the first indication that 
intelligence made people more creative, but a person's religious beliefs
 could hinder or develop this creativity.

The more religious participants in the study were found to be more creative.

Protestants disproportionately chose jobs in the most create industries, too.  

These questions formed the basis of the Illinois study.

Thought this is because they don't have an outlet such as confession - or Catholic guilt
