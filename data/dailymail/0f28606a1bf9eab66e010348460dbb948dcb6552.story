The Ghana Football Association says that striker Asamoah Gyan has suffered from a 'mild bout' of malaria at the Africa Cup of Nations.

He was admitted to the hospital in the remote eastern town of Mongomo in Equatorial Guinea.

The GFA says that Gyan was taken to the hospital on Saturday night, but released on Sunday morning. The GFA says he is responding well to treatment and the disease was caught 'at an early stage.'

Ghana are based in far-eastern Equatorial Guinea for the group stage. Mongomo is one of two remote and little-known venues chosen to host Africa Cup games after Equatorial Guinea stepped in at short notice to take over the tournament from initial host Morocco.

Gyan is now doubtful for Ghana's first game of the tournament against Senegal on Monday.
