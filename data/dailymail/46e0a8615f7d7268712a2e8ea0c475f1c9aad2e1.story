Lukasz Fabianski has admitted he has already forgotten his time as an Arsenal player. 

The 29-year-old spent seven years at the Emirates before joining Swansea on a free transfer earlier this summer. 

Fabianski only started one league game last season - though he did start the FA Cup final victory over Hull in May - and has revealed he has already put his time at Arsenal behind.

'I had many wonderful years there. But I am a Swansea player now and want to focus on that.'
