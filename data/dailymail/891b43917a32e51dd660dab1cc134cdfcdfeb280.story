President Barack Obama is losing the war of words when it comes to radical Islam, experts warn, and he may want to abandon his campaign to separate terrorists in the Middle East from their religion.

Obama has been adamant that the religion of militants affiliated with ISIS is irrelevant even as other world leaders have labeled them Islamic extremists. Bombarded by criticism, the U.S. president dedicated speeches at the White House counter-terrorism summit on Wednesday and Thursday to defending his administration's stance.

But even the name of 1600 Pennsylvania's confab - the Summit on Countering Violent Extremism - suggests the militants are more than just terrorists - they're religious 'extremists,' Obama's critics say, and it's 'self-deception' to pretend otherwise.

'Obama’s reaching a point where he may have to ditch this almost scholastic position,' Akbar Ahmed, chairman of Islamic studies at American University, told the New York Times. 

'He sounds like a distinguished professor in the ivory tower, and he may have to come down into the hurly-burly of politics,' Ahmed warned.

Peter Wehner, deputy director of speech writing for President George W. Bush, told the Times that part of what Obama is facing is 'a semantic battle, but it’s a semantic battle that goes to deeper issues.'

'Self-deception is not a good idea in politics or international affairs. We’re lying to ourselves, and the world knows it,' Wehner, now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, added. 

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday appeared to question Obama's patriotism over the matter.

'I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America,' Giuliani said during a dinner for conservatives at 21 Club in Manhattan, according to Politico.

'He doesn’t love you. And he doesn’t love me. He wasn’t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country.' 

Giuliani, a 2008 candidate for the Republican nomination to the presidency, said Obama has 'to be able to criticize Islam for the parts of Islam that are wrong.'

Referring to remarks Obama made at a prayer breakfast several weeks ago, he charged, 'You criticize Christianity for the part of Christianity that is wrong.'

'I’m not sure how wrong the Crusades are,' Giuliani mused. 'The Crusades were kind of an equal battle between two groups of barbarians. The Muslims and the crusading barbarians.

'What the hell? What’s wrong with this man that he can’t stand up and say there’s a part of Islam that’s sick?' he asked.

Giuliani backtracked on Thursday morning and said he is 'not questioning [Obama's] patriotism.'

'He’s a patriot, I’m sure,' Giuliani said on Fox and Friends. 'What I’m saying is, in his rhetoric, I very rarely hear the things that I used to hear Ronald Reagan say, the things that I used to hear Bill Clinton say about how much he loves America.'

But he stuck to his guns on the need for Obama to 'connect the dots' when it comes to radicals and Islamism.

'If you refuse to say that there are extremist members of the Islamic religion, well then, it sounds like you’re living on Mars,' he said.

On Fox News Wednesday night Texas Sen. Ted Cruz blasted Obama as an 'apologist for radical Islamic terrorists.' 

Cruz accused the administration of having a 'false moral relativism' and invoked Obama's prayer breakfast speech.

'Now last I checked, the Crusades began a millennia ago, and I don’t think it’s too much to ask the president to stay in the current millennium,' Cruz said, per Politico.

The freshman senator and probable Republican presidential candidate said Obama should look to Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a Muslim who has spoken out against violent fundamentalists associated with his religion, as a model.

'Why don’t we see the president of the United States demonstrating that same courage just to speak the truth about the face of evil we’re facing right now?' Cruz asked.

The president spent the better part of a 30 minute speech on Wednesday explaining that, in his administration's view, it only legitimizes Al Qaeda and ISIS to acknowledge their religious affiliation.

'They try to portray themselves as religious leaders - holy warriors in defense of Islam,' he said. That's why ISIS wants to be called the 'Islamic State.'

Furthermore, 'they propagate the notion that America - and the West, generally - is at war with Islam. That’s how they recruit. That’s how they try to radicalize young people,' Obama asserted.

'We must never accept the premise that they put forward, because it is a lie. Nor should we grant these terrorists the religious legitimacy that they seek. They are not religious leaders -- they’re terrorists,' he said to applause. 

'And we are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam.'

Obama dug in his heels in remarks at the summit on Thursday, saying the world cannot give in to terrorists 'especially their attempt to use Islam to justify their violence.'

'These terrorists are desperate for legitimacy, and all of us have a responsibility to refute the notion that groups like ISIL somehow represent Islam,' Obama said during a speech at the State Department. 'Because that is a falsehood that embraces the terrorist narrative.'

Obama chastised the media for not portraying Muslims in a more positive light. Because many Americans don't personally know a Muslim, they go off what they see in the news, he contended.

And 'given the existing news cycle, that can give a very distorted impression.'

'A lot of the bad,' he said, 'like terrorists who claim to speak for Islam, that's absorbed by the population, and not enough of the good.

Even as the president has been hit from the right for not drawing a strong enough time between ISIS and Islamism, he has also been hit from Muslim communities over summit speakers' focus on acts of terror committed by groups with roots in Islam. 

A group of Muslim-Americans protested outside the White House on Wednesday in the bitter cold to bring awareness to their argument - that the Obama administration is unfairly singling out Muslims in its fight against ISIS.

The White House admitted on Wednesday that it was 'very mindful' of the fact that a 'particularly virulent strain of extremist ideology has tried to insert itself in the Muslim community.'

'There’s no question about that,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. 'That's true in the United States; that's true in other places around the world. And that will be the subject of extensive discussion at the summit.'

Obama said Thursday that the coalition against ISIS must also acknowledge that radicals are 'deliberately targeting their propaganda' at Muslim communities, particularly young people of that faith.

Muslims need to refute the notion 'that we are the cause of every ill in the Middle East,' Obama argued, because that narrative has also become a foundation for ISIS to try to justify its violence.'
