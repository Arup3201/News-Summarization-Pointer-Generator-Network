At least four cats have been killed and around 15 are currently unaccounted for after a cattery where the pets were being held burned down today.

The fire is thought to have started early in the morning as the result of a faulty heater in one of the animal's pens, and swiftly spread to the cattery's main building.

The owner of the Pinetrees cattery in Cannock, Staffordshire revealed that four of her own pets had died in the blaze as she wept over the deaths of the animals she was looking after.

Aftermath: Police and fire officers were investigating the source of a blaze at Pinetrees cattery on Friday

Staffordshire Fire and Rescue spent five hours battling the fire on Friday morning, but a spokesman said the brigade was not treating the incident as suspicious.

Two of the cats survived and were treated for smoke inhalation, but of more than 20 which had been staying at the site all the rest were either found dead or were missing in the aftermath of the blaze.

Proprietor Lynn Durnall was emotional as she talked about the fire which had devastated her business.

'We've contacted those involved,' she said. 'It's very hard.

'Four of the cats that died belonged to us. I'm devastated.'

Her father Patrick Johnson described the horror of waking up to the disaster, and apologised to those who had entrusted their pets to the facility.

'We woke up to the flames coming out of the skylight,' he said.

'On behalf of my daughter, who runs the cattery, I'd like to say how sorry we are, because we all love our animals.'

Pinetrees offers a year-round service to pet owners, who pay from £6 a day to give their cats access to 'heated chalets' and 'diet catering'.

Visitors to the cattery's website today offered a steady stream of condolences in the wake of the accident.

'So sorry to hear about the fire on the news,' one well-wisher said. 'Our thoughts are with you, praying for you as you rebuild your business and hoping the moggies that ran into the forest are found.'

Another wrote: 'So sad about the news, I would like to offer my volunteer services to help re-build, look after the cats and make it a special cattery again.'

Local fire chief Dermot Hogan said the brigade had sent six crews to the fire, with a total of 35 people fighting to control the blaze.

'The building has been destroyed as it was predominately a wooden structure and we’ve been unable to confirm so far how many cats have died in the fire,' he said.

'A fire investigation was carried out to establish how the fire started and we believe an electrical fault within one of the pens is to blame.'
