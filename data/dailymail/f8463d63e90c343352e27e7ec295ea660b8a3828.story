He recently confirmed that his romance with Mollie King is back on and it isn't just David Gandy's personal life that's booming.

The male supermodel has landed yet another campaign for M&S - this time modelling the high street giant's winter collection.

David, who has been working for the retail chain for years, looks dapper in a selection of traditional and masculine pieces from the collection.

Christmas came early: David Gandy has been unveiled as M&S' latest posterboy and he's modelling the high street giant's range of winter menswear

Posing in an array of classic and tailored pieces, David proves high street can look high-end with the right styling.

David looks dapper in a quilted leather bomber jacket and luxury blue velvet evening jacket - and Mollie is sure to approve. 

After being photographed walking hand-in-hand with his former girlfriend, David recently confirmed that he is in fact dating Saturdays beauty Mollie.

The couple - whose 10-month relationship came to an abrupt end in 2011 - appear to be taking things seriously.

In an interview with the Evening Standard magazine, it has been revealed that the pop star has her own clothes drawer in the model’s custom built walk-in wardrobe, with her name scratched across it. 

When quizzed about the named compartment in his bedroom, the 34-year-old hunk simply replied: ‘That may be there for a while, so, uh…’

The interviewer then joked that someone ‘should book the church’, to which Gandy quipped: ‘There you go. Even though she steals all my clothes.’

In a picture, taken in late September and exclusively obtained by MailOnline, the pair were seen taking a leisurely stroll in London with Mollie's poodle Alfie.

A source exclusively told MailOnline: 'They seemed really relaxed and comfortable with each other. They were very affectionate. They were coming out of a cafe with her dog and didn't seem to care who saw them holding hands.' 

It's back on! The couple – whose 10-month relationship came to an abrupt end in 2011 – appear to be taking things seriously
