When his parents built a play pirate ship in his back garden, four-year-old Joseph Bailey was thrilled.

The wooden ship, crafted from recycled timber, became his pride and joy and the ‘labour of love’ was admired by everyone who saw it.

But then a neighbour complained to the council that Joseph was invading their privacy, claiming he could spy on them over the fence.

Four-year-old Joseph Bailey's wooden pirate ship, crafted from recycled timber, faces demolition because a neighbour complained to the council that he was invading their privacy

And despite his parents erecting a bamboo screen to solve any privacy issues, the 19ft by 8ft ship, complete with Jolly Roger, now faces demolition.

Rushmoor Borough Council has ordered mum and dad Paola and Marcus to either dismantle the ship or apply for retrospective planning permission – because the structure has ‘raised platforms’ more than 12 inches (30cm) high.

Last night Mr Bailey, 46, a company director, said: ‘The thought of having to dismantle Joseph’s ship is devastating. He loves it and that would break his heart.’

The couple, from Farnborough, Hampshire, began building the ship, which also incorporates a wheel, slide, dens and two sets of stairs in May.

Mr Bailey said: ‘Joseph has always loved pirates and it promised to be a lovely family project – something the three of us could enjoy doing together.

‘When we told him we were going to build a ship he was so excited. It took us three-and-a-half weeks to construct and we made it up as we went along. It was a labour of love and we were so proud of it.’

But three weeks after the project was finished, they received a letter from the council.

‘The end of the garden where we built the pirate ship is surrounded by five neighbours and sadly one of them said Joseph could spy on them,’ said Mr Bailey. ‘It seemed ridiculous to be worrying about one little boy who only plays on it for a few minutes at a time, and the area is already well screened by trees.’

Joseph, with parents, Paola and Marcus, may soon be without his pirate ship after complaints from neighbours

Keen not to fall out with their neighbours, the Baileys erected a solid bamboo fence. But despite this, the council still said the ship needed full planning permission.

The Baileys have since liaised with the local authority which says one way to comply with regulations would be to remove parts that are too high. But, the couple claims this would mean demolishing the wheel, slide and two sets of stairs. ‘It would ruin Joseph’s fun because it would no longer be a ship,’ Mr Bailey said.

They now propose to put in the planning application, which will cost £212. Mrs Bailey, 36, said: ‘It seems ludicrous we have to pay for this application, as the council has already indicated it is likely to be refused. But we don’t know how we would tell Joseph his ship has to be dismantled. So if it is refused then we will appeal.’

A spokesman for Rushmoor Borough Council said: ‘We received a complaint about the effect on neighbours’ privacy and so were obliged to investigate.’
