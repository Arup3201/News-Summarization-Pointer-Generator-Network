Sirhan Sirhan, the man convicted for the assassination of Senator and presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy, is appealing his sentence of life in prison, claiming that he is innocent.

He has repeatedly protested his innocence and requested parole, with his most recent request denied in March.

Sirhan’s lawyers, William Pepper and Laurie Dusek, are using a defence that is eerily familiar to another Kennedy murder - that there was more than one shooter.

They say the 67-year-old Christian Palestinian born in Jerusalem was hypno-programmed to divert attention from a shooter who actually killed Mr Kennedy in 1968. They also allege he was an easy scapegoat because he is Arab.

The attorneys cite an expert analysis of ‘new evidence’ that shows two guns were fired on the night Mr Kennedy was assassinated in the former Ambassador Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.

According to court papers, Sirhan has stronger eyewitness evidence, along with ‘scientific, forensic evidence which cannot be credibly refuted’ that was not available during his 1969 trial.

The attorneys allege that fraud was 
committed during the trial when the court counted an ancillary bullet as
 evidence for a bullet that was retrieved from Mr Kennedy’s neck.

Mr Pepper says the substitute bullet had been matched to others from Sirhan’s weapon.

Mind control and hypno-programming 
are serious and real and have been used for decades by the CIA, U.S. 
military and other covert operations, Mr Pepper and Mrs Dusek say in the
 federal court papers, which were filed earlier this week.

‘The
 public has been shielded from the darker side of the practice. The 
average person is unaware that hypnosis can and is used to induct 
antisocial conduct in humans,’ the court papers say.

They
 attest to Sirhan’s innocence, saying: ‘[Sirhan] was an involuntary 
participant in the crimes being committed because he was subjected to 
sophisticated hypno-programing and memory implantation techniques which 
rendered him unable to consciously control his thoughts and actions at 
the time the crimes were being committed.’

Mr Pepper told CNN that new examination of audio from that fateful June night ‘clearly showed that 13 shots were fired in the pantry, and Sirhan’s gun had only eight shots, so it definitely means there was a second shooter.’

An analysis of a recently recovered audiotape recorded by a freelance journalist gives Sirhan’s attorneys new fuel for their case.

The tape – discovered by CNN’s Brad 
Johnson – has the only known audio recording of the shots fired at 
Robert Kennedy, recorded from 40 feet away from the shooting.

Two experts independently verified that more than eight shots were captured on the tape.

One of the analysts, Phillip Van Praag, says the shots were too close together to have all come from Sirhan’s handgun.

Nor would Sirhan have had time to reload in the amount of time the shots were fired, Mr Van Praag says.

Robert’s death, much like his brother John’s, is shrouded in mystery and a never-ending list of conspiracy theories that popularly involve multiple shooters and government plots.

Sirhan is serving a life sentence at 
Pleasant Valley State Prison in Coalinga, California after he was 
convicted of killing Mr Kennedy and wounding five others during the June
 5, 1968 shooting in the pantry of the glamorous Ambassador Hotel.

Mr
 Kennedy, having just delivered a short speech after winning 
California’s Primary Election, was ushered through a kitchen pantry en 
route to a room where reporters were waiting for a press conference.

Shots rang out– three bullets struck Mr Kennedy, and a fourth grazed his suit coat. He died the next day in the nearby Good Samaritan hospital.

Sirhan was arrested at the scene and indicted for murder.

After the 1969 trial, he was convicted to death, a sentence that was overturned in 1972 in exchange for life in prison.

He has repeatedly been seeking parole - and denied it - since 1983.
