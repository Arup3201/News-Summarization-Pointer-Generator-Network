A carer who stole the savings of an Alzheimer’s sufferer she was looking after and avoided punishment by pretending to have cancer was jailed for 17 months yesterday.

Lisa Whitehead, 41, twice conned courts with her fake pancreatic cancer condition.

She was sentenced to do unpaid work for the theft but avoided doing it by convincing the authorities she was having chemotherapy.

Mrs Whitehead, of Market Weighton, was initially exposed as a three-time fraudster in 2009 after forging a prescription for drugs, scamming benefits, and then stealing £7,000 from an Alzheimer's sufferer

Later she lied again to a judge to try to stop her home being repossessed.

When her cancer condition was exposed 
as a sham she failed to turn up in court on five occasions in 60 days, 
making further false claims about her health and getting herself 
admitted to hospital to avoid being sentenced for her latest crime.

The judge at Hull Crown Court became 
so exasperated by her lies and behaviour he even ordered police to 
arrest her in hospital if necessary.

Passing sentence, Judge Mark Bury told
her: ‘It seems to me that you have a streak of dishonesty running 
through you like a stick of Blackpool rock. You told the courts that you
had pancreatic cancer and were undergoing chemotherapy. This was not 
true.’

Whitehead, of Market Weighton, East 
Yorkshire, was given nine months behind bars when the judge implemented 
the suspended jail sentence for the original theft offence. He added a 
consecutive eight-month term for perverting the course of justice by 
lying in court about her cancer.

Whitehead’s shameless behaviour began 
when she stole £7,000 from a 91-year-old with Alzheimer’s over a 
six-month period while working as her carer. She was given a suspended 
jail sentence, told to do 250 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay 
£1,000 costs after admitting theft at Hull Crown Court in 2010.

Whitehead, who has a previous 
conviction for benefit fraud, told probation workers she had pancreatic 
cancer and avoided doing her community work.

She used her fake cancer condition as 
an excuse again when taken to Hull County Court by a housing association
for being £1,700 behind on her rent.

Whitehead forged a doctor’s note – 
writing in felt tip ‘Lisa has cancer and is a very poorly lady’ – to try
to avoid losing her home. The district judge saw through the ruse and 
Whitehead was evicted.

She was charged with perverting the 
course of justice over the county court forgery and admitted the charge,
but delayed her inevitable prison sentence by repeatedly feigning 
illness to avoid turning up at Hull Crown Court.

After the second missed hearing police
went to hospital – where Whitehead had been admitted for tests – and 
were under orders to arrest her on the ward if necessary. However, 
because she was a patient officers let her stay in hospital.

Three days later she turned up for the
third scheduled hearing two hours late. Whitehead asked for a glass of 
water and collapsed in the public area outside the court room, 
apparently having a fit.

She was stretchered out of the 
building by paramedics and taken by ambulance to Hull Royal Infirmary. 
She was released later that day having made a full recovery.

The incident happened on Friday November 2 and the judge ordered her to appear again on the Monday with a doctor’s note.

However, on the Sunday she went to 
York Hospital and the judge was told the following day that she was 
having a hernia operation. Eventually police arrested her and took her 
to court for sentencing.

Joanna Golding, defending, said 
Whitehead had been ill at various times because of an ‘underlying 
medical condition’ but ‘it was  not cancer’.
