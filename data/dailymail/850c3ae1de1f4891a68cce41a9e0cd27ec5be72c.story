First it's the sweeping black lines, then you notice the eye-like dots, then the distinctive mustache, and then the whole combo comes together to make this creepy-crawly even creepier.

A photographer in India was speechless after he spotted the face of Hitler on the back of a common stink bug.

The snapper was getting some pictures of the local wildlife in his back garden when he spotted the bug had an incredibly peculiar pattern resembling the German ex-dictator.

Subbu Sullia, 29, from Bangalore, India noticed almost straight away that the markings on the insect's back resembled the hair line and tiny mustache that made German leader's face so recognisable.

He kept trying to get the bugs best side, but was unable to capture it's most f√ºhrer-like pose because it kept running away.

He said: 'I was clicking away at butterflies in our garden and suddenly I spotted the bug running on soil.

'It had what I thought was a mask kind of pattern on its body which drew my attention.

The photographer was left speechless when he spotted the spitting image of Hitler on the back of an insect, immediately changing his focus from his garden's butterflies to the dictator insect

'It looked like Hitler because of the distinct moustache pattern.

'I wasn't able to get too many shots because it was running but from what I got all my friends were curious and thought it looked like his face.'

But this bug is just another in a long series of animals, and everyday objects, that look like the infamous dictator.

In 2011, MailOnline introduced the public to the 'Hitler house', a building in Swansea that had an unfortunate resemblance to Hitler with a sweeping roof and thin, dark door underneath two windows.

After this, MailOnline started receiving pictures of animals that looked like the dictator in droves.

Tash the Cat, the pub mog from St Peter's Port in Guernsey was one of those animals.

Named 'Tash' because of it's unfortunate smattering of facial hair, the cat also sports a dark black barnet, making her look more like the infamous German leader than a simple cat with a mustache.

Patrons at the Salerie Inn also pointed out the distinction, making sure that the landlady, Annette Blows, knew it!
