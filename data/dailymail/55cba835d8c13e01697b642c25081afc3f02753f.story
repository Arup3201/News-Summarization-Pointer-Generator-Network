A federal judge Wednesday dismissed charges against a diplomat whose New York arrest and strip search spurred an international flap.

A ruling filed today said Devyani Khobragade, India's former deputy consul-general, had diplomatic immunity when she was indicted on charges of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her housekeeper and lying about the maid's pay January 9.

But the ruling leaves open the possibility prosecutors could bring a new indictment against her. The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan hasn't commented on its plans.

Cleared: A federal judge dismissed charges against Devyani Khobragade, 39, saying she had diplomatic immunity when she was indicted on charges of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her housekeeper 

Khobragade's attorney, Daniel Arshack, said she feels the rule of law prevailed.

‘The law requires that any prosecution brought against an individual with diplomatic immunity must be dismissed, Arshack said.

After
 being indicted, she complied with a Department of State order to leave 
the U.S. in January. The Indian government then asked Washington to 
withdraw a diplomat from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. The U.S. 
complied.

Prosecutors accused Khobragade of making Sangeeta Richard, her housekeeper and nanny, work 100-hour weeks at a salary of just over $1 an hour, far below the legal minimum U.S. wage of $7.25 an hour.

They argued that the indictment should stand because Khobragade did not have diplomatic immunity either when she was arrested, or now given that she has left the country.

U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin said, however, Khobragade had that immunity on January 9 when the indictment was issued, having the day before been named a counselor to India's mission to the United Nations.

‘Even if Khobragade had no immunity at the time of her arrest and has none now, her acquisition of immunity during the pendency of proceedings mandates dismissal.’ she wrote.

‘The government may not proceed on an indictment obtained when Khobragade was immune from the jurisdiction of the court.’

She also lifted Khobragade's bail and said open arrest warrants based on the indictment must be thrown out.

Khobragade is now working for India's foreign affairs ministry in Delhi, said her U.S. lawyer.Federal prosecutors have not said whether they will seek a new indictment.

‘As the court indicated in its 
decision, and as Devyani Khobragade has conceded, there is currently no 
bar to a new indictment against her for her alleged criminal conduct, 
and we intend to proceed accordingly,’ said James Margolin, a spokesman 
for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan.

In
 January, Khobragade, 39, told an Indian newspaper about her ‘immense 
stress’ at leaving behind her daughters - aged seven and four - in New 
York along with her husband, who is a U.S. citizen and works as an 
academic.

‘I wonder if I will be able to ever reunite with my family, my husband, my little kids. I miss them,’ she told The Sunday Express at the time.

Khobragade was charged by a federal grand jury in Manhattan earlier this year with visa fraud and making false statements in a case that has triggered an outcry in India.

She was accused of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her New York City housekeeper.

The indictment said Khobragade had made multiple false representations to U.S. authorities, or caused them to be made, to obtain a visa for a personal domestic worker. 

Khobragade, 39, was accused of exploiting her 
Indian-born housekeeper and nanny by paying her well under the U.S. minimum wage 

Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper 
Sangeeta Richard (pictured), filed a court petition in New Delhi saying 
that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat 
Devyani Khobragade

She planned to bring the worker to the 
United States in September 2012 when she worked at the Consulate General
 of India in New York, according to the indictment.

Khobragade,
 39, India's deputy consul general in New York, has maintained her 
innocence to accusations that she claimed to pay her Indian maid $4,500 
per month but actually gave her far less than the U.S. minimum wage.

Her
 arrest sparked outrage in India after revelations that she 
was strip-searched and thrown in a cell with other criminal defendants 
before being released on $250,000 bail.

In
 a letter to the judge, prosecutors said there was no need for an 
arraignment because Khobragade had 'very recently' been given diplomatic
 immunity status to leave the United States.

housekeeper and paying her only $3 per hour
