The Boy Scouts of America fired its first openly-gay Scoutmaster this week since voting to allow homosexual youth to join the organization in January.

Geoff McGrath, a 49-year-old Eagle Scout, was asked to start a new troop by a reverend at his inclusive Methodist church in Seattle last year and says he didn't conceal his sexual orientation from scouts, their parents or organization officials.

While the BSA's recent decision allows openly-gay youth to join their ranks, it still bars homosexual men from being leaders.

So when the BSA's national headquarters found out about McGraths sexual-orientation earlier this week in the midst of a report by NBC News, his position as a the leader of Troop 98 was 'revoked'.

Mr McGarth was invited to set up Troop 98 in Seattle last year by the pastor of an inclusive Methodist church and says he was open about his sexuality with both members and officials

BSA Spokesman Deron Smith says it was only until reporters contacted the organization about McGrath for a story that they found out he was gay.

'Our policy is that we do not ask people about their sexual orientation, and it’s not an issue until they deliberately inject it into Scouting in an inappropriate fashion,' Smith said in an email to NBC. 

Before his sacking, McGrath believes he was the only openly-gay troop leader in the country.

'It’s extremely disappointing to not be fully supported and defended in my membership,' McGrath said. 'They are complaining that the problem [his status as an openly gay man] is a distraction to Scouting and they don’t seem to understand that the distraction is self-inflicted.'

McGrath started leading Troop 98 last fall after he was asked by Reverand Monica Corsaro of Rainier Beach United Methodist Church.

Rev Corsaro wanted to start an inclusive troop for local youth, and reached out to McGrath who attends the church with his husband of 20 years.

McGrath was hesitant to start the group at first because he had his own troubled history with the BSA.

When he was 22-years-old, McGrath was offered the position of Assistant Scoutmaster but that was job was rescinded once his troop leaders figured out he was day.

The troop was also sponsored by his Mormon church, and he was additionally excommunicated from the religion.

He agreed to start the program, in part inspired by the work of his straight twin-brother Dave who has publicly championed for gays to be admitted into to the scouts.

'If you don’t participate, you're not part of the conversation,' McGrath, a software engineer, said.  'Yelling from the outside is not conversing. So we're on the inside doing good work. Talking about the gay and lesbian issue is not the biggest part of what we do—it's the smallest part.'

But McGrath makes clear that his decision to lead the troop was not part of a publicity stunt, but because he genuinely wanted to help out the local kids.

And his troop at Rainier Beach, including their parents, thank him for his work.

'Anyone who is willing to step forward and provide an opportunity for our youth should be supported, and Geoff has done an excellent job,' said Denise Mimura, whose son, 14-year-old son Jonathan is in the troop. 'If anyone has an issue with this, then where are they?'

The troop currently consists of all straight boys, but gay high-schooler Koyle Kendrick, 17, says he plans to join the troops after the end of the school year.

Kendrick left another troop last year because it didn't feel gay-friendly.

'I'll be more comfortable going back into Scouting and being in an inclusive troop,' he said, adding that McGrath will 'understand where I'm coming from.'

McGrath certainly understands Kendrick's perspective, having experienced a similar isolation growing up and feeling like he was the only gay person around.

'One of the things that’s different now with our troop from when I was a youth in the Scouts, was there were no identifiable gay or lesbian adults,' McGrath said.

For his part, McGrath hopes that 'cooler minds will prevail' and he will be allowed to continue as Scoutmaster.

'That's what I believe. If it doesn't happen today, that will be disappointing. But it doesn't mean it won't ever happen,' he said.

In a message on Facebook, McGrath said he hasn't received an official notification from the BSA that he is no longer a Scoutmaster and says he will continue to lead the group until told otherwise by his church's revered.

The BSA says it has no plans to review its membership policy to allow gay leaders at this time.
