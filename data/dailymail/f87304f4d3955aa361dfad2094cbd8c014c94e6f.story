Hacked Off: It has been claimed Hugh Grant telephoned senior members of Labour's Shadow Cabinet to urge them not to accept David Cameron's compromise on Press regulation

Hugh Grant telephoned senior members of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet to urge them not to accept David Cameron’s compromise on Press regulation, say sources close to the talks.

The actor, a figurehead for the Hacked Off campaign group, appeared on television to warn that the Government’s entire legislative programme would be held to ransom if it did not back down.

Hacked Off has been closely involved in amendments already tabled to Bills in the House of Lords implementing some form of ‘Leveson law’ – meaning Mr Cameron would be unable to allow them to proceed in the Commons for fear of statutory regulation of the Press being passed thanks to Labour and Liberal Democrat votes.

‘This will keep happening and the Government’s legislative agenda will be completely screwed because no one will give up on this,’ Mr Grant, a victim of phone hacking, told the BBC.

‘This is the will of the people and it is not right that a tiny rump of Conservatives who happen to be in the executive are doing the will of the Press.’

Sources close to the talks claimed Hacked Off had warned it would attack Labour – and media spokesman and deputy leader Harriet Harman in particular – as ‘traitors’ if they backed Mr Cameron’s proposed Royal Charter.

One said that ‘at least four’ members of the Shadow Cabinet had received calls from Mr Grant. And a Tory source said Labour appeared to be ‘acting as the political wing of Hacked Off’.

After Mr Cameron abandoned cross-party talks yesterday, Mr Grant wrote on Twitter: ‘Rumour in Westminster that editor of Times instructed Cameron to call off talks. And our PM did as he was told. Murdoch rules. Still.’

A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Grant’s suggestion that Mr Cameron had been told what to do by Times editor John Witherow was ‘complete nonsense’.

Hacked Off denied that Mr Grant had called members of the Shadow Cabinet, or that it had prepared a draft press release attacking Labour if it had backed a deal.

Executive director Professor Brian Cathcart said: ‘The Prime Minister has walked away from talks in which other parties were trying desperately to accommodate his views on a Royal Charter.

‘Instead he has chosen to throw his lot in with powerful national newspaper groups, whose actions were condemned in the Leveson report. His version of the Royal Charter would have paved the way for a regulatory system little different from the discredited Press Complaints Commission.’

David Hass, spokesman for Hacked Off, said later of the claims Mr Grant had been telephoning shadow Cabinet ministers: 'We keep in close contact with senior members of all parties to help explain the urgent need for reform.

'Victims feel betrayed by David Cameron, not Nick Clegg or Ed Miliband as they have kept their word.'

■ Chris Huhne spent his last night of freedom attending a wedding reception with other Hacked Off campaigners. The disgraced Liberal Democrat was at the party to mark the marriage to financier James Burr of lawyer Charlotte Harris, a partner with the firm Mishcon de Reya, who represented phone-hacking victims at the Leveson Inquiry.

Miss Harris also represented Huhne’s lover Carina Trimingham in her unsuccessful attempt to sue the Daily Mail.

Labour MP Tom Watson, one of the main champions of tighter Press regulation was also there.

He was also seen deep in conversation with PR guru Max Clifford at the Inner Temple in central London.
