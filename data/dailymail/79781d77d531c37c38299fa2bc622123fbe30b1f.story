Have you ever imagined a world where everyone looked like a bodybuilder?

Hilarious new photoshopped images have been created to show how celebrities might look if they spent all their spare time down on Muscle Beach in Los Angeles.

The faces of well known actors such as Johnny Depp, Charlize Theron and Gwyneth Paltrow have been blended on to bodybuilder frames for an online competition.
