Ministers want the average age at which people give up work to rise by six months every year to make sure pensioners have more money in retirement, document reveal.

The Government says the move is crucial to offset the growing elderly care and pension costs – as well as bringing in more tax receipts.

The Department of Work and Pensions has for the first time set specific targets to increase the average age at which workers retire.

Life expectancy in the UK is increasing every year - dramatically increasing the costs of looking after the elderly

Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said retiring later in life would boost people's incomes after work by 10 per cent a year

Ministers say that by working longer pensioners can boost their retirement income, leaving them less reliant on the state for their care costs.

Steve Webb, the Liberal Democrat pensions minister, told the Telegraph the target was ‘ambitious’ but said it was already happening with women who were choosing to work longer.

He said: ‘If someone works an extra year they can add 10 per cent to their pension for life. What we are doing is catching up with decades of longer living.

‘We are living longer but the labour market and people’s retirement age has not been keeping up. I have fought against a vague target of trying to get people to work longer to have something more specific.’

The Government's older workers' champion Ros Altmann said working longer boosts people's retirement incomes

Dr Ros Altmann, a pensions expert and the Government’s older workers’ champion, added: ‘There is certainly a great merit in enabling and encouraging people to work longer so that they can get higher incomes over their lifetimes.’

The number of over-65s in England is expected to increase by 51 per cent over the next 20 years, and the numbers of those aged 85 and above will double by 2030.

Men are now retiring at 64 and eight months – while women stop work at 63 and a month.

But the Government wants to see this rapidly increase to match the rise in the state pension age, which is expected to go up to 70 within the next 50 years.

The target is contained in a document released by the Department for Work and Pensions which makes clear that an increase of six months would be a ‘meaningful change’.

‘An increase in the average age of withdrawal of more than around 0.5 years would demonstrate an improvement,’ the document states.

Mr Webb has said that the growing numbers of people living into their eighties and nineties would leave taxpayers with a rising bill and meant ‘the sums’ would never add up if people continued to retire in their fifties.

George Osborne announced earlier this year that increases in life expectancy will automatically trigger a rise in the state pension age, which is likely to rise to 70 within 50 years.

The state pension age is currently 65 for men, and is rising from 60 for women to come into line with men at 66 by 2020.

It will continue to rise so people in their late twenties are likely to have to work until their 70th birthdays, according to official projections.

The Office for Budget Responsibility said that Coalition policies such as raising the state pension age will slash Britain’s debts.
