A con artist who told woman she was being convicted of tax fraud seemingly had an attack of guilt after finding out she was pregnant.

Sarah Carr, who owns three event venue businesses in Denver, Colorado, told 9News that she received a voicemail on her cell phone from a man who claimed to be from the IRS.

Ms Carr said she she rang the number back and broke down in tears at the news at 8am on Tuesday morning.

The man told her there was a lien on one of her properties and Ms Carr said he was believable as he knew so many personal and private details about her business and finances.

'I just start crying,' Carr told KUSA. 

'I said, 'I'm nine months pregnant...I don't know what I'm going to do.'

'And then he says, 'Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're pregnant?' and I said, 'Yes!' And he goes, 'I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry, this is a scam. You're okay, we're scamming you. 

'We were just trying to get money out of you. Please stop crying,'' Carr said.

She said the man then hung up and ended the call.

Ms Carr, who already has a young son, said her immediate relief at not owing money than turned to a mixture of anger and fear as the man had been so convincing due to his knowledge of her situation. 

'I was like super happy that I wasn't' going to jail. But then I was just really freaked out,' Ms Carr said. 

Fake IRS agents have now targeted more than 366,000 people with harassing phone calls demanding payments and threatening jail as part of a huge nationwide tax scam that has cost taxpayers $15.5 million.

More than 3,000 people have fallen for the ruse since 2013, Timothy Camus, a Treasury deputy inspector general for tax administration, said Thursday.

The scam has claimed victims in almost every state, Camus said. One unidentified victim lost more than $500,000.

'The criminals do not discriminate. They are calling people everywhere, of all income levels and backgrounds,' Camus told the Senate Finance Committee at a hearing. 'The number of complaints we have received about this scam make it the largest, most pervasive impersonation scam in the history of our agency.'

With tax season in full swing, the IRS is warning taxpayers about a huge nationwide scam in which fake IRS agents call people on the phone, demand payments and threaten them with jail if they don't pay.

Some tips from the IRS to void the scam:

The IRS will never call about taxes owed without first mailing you a notice.

The IRS will never demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount the agency says you owe.

The IRS will never require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes, such as a prepaid debit card.

The IRS will never ask for credit card or debit card numbers over the phone.The IRS will never threaten to have you arrested for not paying.

If you get a phone call from someone claiming to be from the IRS and asking for money, here's what the IRS says you should do:

If you think you might owe back taxes, hang up and call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040.

If you know you don't owe taxes, report the incident to the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, at 1-800-366-4484, or online at www.tigta.gov . 

The scam is so widespread that investigators believe there is more than one group of perpetrators, including some overseas.

Camus said even he received a call from one of the scammers at his home on a Saturday. He said he had a stern message for the caller: 'Your day will come.'

So far, Camus said, two people in Florida have been arrested. They were accused of being part of a scam that involved people in call centers in India contacting U.S. taxpayers and pretending to be IRS agents.

'These criminal acts are perpetrated by thieves hiding behind telephone lines and computers, preying on honest taxpayers and robbing the Treasury of tens of billions of dollars every year,' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 

'Taxpayers must be more aware of the risks and better protected from attack and these criminals must be found and brought to justice.'

The inspector general's office started warning taxpayers about the scam a year ago, but it has since ballooned. Tax scams often increase during filing season.

As part of the scam, fake IRS agents call taxpayers, claim they owe taxes, and demand payment using a prepaid debit card or a wire transfer. Those who refuse are threatened with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver's license, Camus said.

The callers might even know the last four digits of the taxpayer's Social Security number, Camus said.

They request prepaid debit cards because they are harder to trace than bank cards. 

Prepaid debit cards are different from bank cards because they are not connected to a bank account.

Instead, consumers buy the cards at stores, and use them just like a bank card, until the money runs out or they add more.

Real IRS agents usually contact people first by mail, Camus said. And they never demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer.

'Our message is simple,' Camus said. 'If someone calls unexpectedly claiming to be from the IRS with aggressive threats if you do not pay immediately, it is a scam artist calling. 

The IRS does not initiate contact with taxpayers by telephone. If you do owe money to the IRS, chances are you have already received some form of a notice or correspondence from the IRS in your mailbox.'

The inspector general's office started receiving complaints about the scam in 2013. Immigrants were the primary target early on, the IG's office said. But the scam has since become more widespread.
