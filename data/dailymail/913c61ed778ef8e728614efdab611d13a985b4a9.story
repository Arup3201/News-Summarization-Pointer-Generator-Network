Trotskyite past: Left-wing Simon Fletcher once accused Gordon Brown of 'pandering to fascism' in a newspaper article

A left-wing crony of Ken Livingstone who accused  Gordon Brown of ‘pandering to fascism’ and said Prince Charles talked ‘reactionary nonsense’ has been given a top job by Labour leader Ed Miliband.

Simon Fletcher, who was Mr Livingstone’s chief-of-staff when he was Mayor of London, is Mr Miliband’s new adviser on trade unions.

Mr Fletcher was a member of Mr Livingstone’s so-called ‘Kenocracy’, a group of close advisers when he was Mayor, and was said to be in Trotskyite group Socialist Action, which plotted to make London a ‘socialist city state’.

After Mr Livingstone lost power to Boris Johnson in 2008, Mr Fletcher was deeply critical of Mr Miliband’s former boss Gordon Brown, who was then Prime Minister.

In 2009, in an article in The Guardian newspaper headlined ‘Pandering to the fascists on housing’, Mr Fletcher denounced Mr Brown’s plan to make it easier for local families to get council homes. Mr Miliband, who was in Mr Brown’s Cabinet at the time, supported the scheme.

Mr Fletcher wrote: ‘Gordon Brown’s plans for social housing allocation revive the myth perpetuated by the BNP that migrants force locals out. When he announced it he must have known he would reopen the debate on race and waiting lists, an issue the fascist British National Party has long sought to exploit.

‘The difficulties people encounter in getting a good affordable home are nothing to do with immigration. It is a myth. Pandering to the BNP or the lies that it has promoted and exploited does not weaken it. It strengthens it.’

He added that Mr Brown and his Government had ‘learned little from the debacle over its disastrous slogan ‘British jobs for British workers’.

‘Labour needs to start learning the lesson that defeating fascism cannot be done by first conceding to it,’ he wrote.

Months earlier, Mr Fletcher rounded on Prince Charles for criticising the £3 billion development plan for Chelsea Barracks in West London by the rulers of Gulf state Qatar. Headed ‘Dragging London backwards’, he said Prince Charles’s ‘reactionary views on architecture would turn a vibrant city stale’ and told  him to ‘get out of the Chelsea Barracks row’.

Top job: Labour leader Ed Miliband has appointed Simon Fletcher as his £50,000-a-year trade union officer

In the same year, he backed TUC general secretary Brendan Barber in a row over plans by Mr Brown’s administration to crack down on welfare cheats.

He said: ‘As Brendan Barber argued, at a time of rapidly  rising unemployment, the Government needs to stop talking as if every benefit claimant is a potential scrounger.

‘Welfare debate in this country is too often dominated by an endless macho competition to see who can be toughest on “dependency culture”.

‘Labour should not chase the headline-chasing obsession with talking tough.’Mr Fletcher has been appointed Mr Miliband’s £50,000-a-year trade union liaison officer and will report directly to the Labour leader.

He will be responsible for maintaining good relations between union barons and Mr Miliband.A biography of Mr Livingstone said his support for Socialist Action helped make it ‘probably the most successful and influential revolutionary Marxist organisation in Britain’.

Mr Fletcher is believed to have received a six-figure payoff when he lost his job as the Mayor’s chief-of-staff in 2008.

Mr Miliband’s office declined to comment.

A Labour source said: ‘Simon has joined. He will be a very strong and valued addition to the team.’
