Jaycee Dugard, who is suing federal officials over her 18-year rape and kidnapping ordeal, has accused the government of tampering with the sole expert witness in her case.

Miss Dugard claims that convicted rapist Phillip Garrido should have had his parole revoked by the Department of Justice before he abducted her.

Garrido and his wife snatched 11-year-old Jaycee 
from a street in South Lake Tahoe in June 1991 while on her way to 
school.

She was held captive in a compound behind their Antioch house where Garrido repeatedly 
raped and drugged the girl. During her captivity, Dugard gave birth to 
two daughters fathered by Garrido.

Vulnerable: Jaycee Dugard, now 32, is suing the federal government over failures to check up on convicted rapist Phillip Garrido who snatched her while he was out on bail in 1991

Dugard's lawsuit 
claims that federal agents failed to meet with Garrido as frequently as 
required and to properly report his frequent 
marijuana use. He was on parole after serving 11 years of a 50-year sentence when she was kidnapped.

A verdict in Dugard's favor in the federal compensation suit would leave a jury to determine the amount of damages.

In court papers filed on Monday, Dugard's lawyers complained the Department of Justice fouled up their case by contacting their sole expert witness.

Attorney Dale Kinsella said his legal team spent more than 50 hours 
over three months working with Carol Getty, who was prepared to testify 
on Miss Dugard's behalf. Getty served as chair of the U.S. Parole Commission 
from 1991 to 1992.

Mr Kinsella alleged that government lawyers called Getty on August 1 and told her that
it was improper to serve as an expert witness because she served on the
commission during the some of the time in question.

Failed by the system: Jaycee Dugard was 11 when she was kidnapped by a convicted rapist who was out on bail in California

Later that same day, Ms Getty told Dugard's lawyers she wanted nothing more to do with the case.

Mr Kinsella said that 'it comes 
as no surprise that her name appears on a commission document during 
that time period' but that there is no evidence that she was directly 
involved in Garrido's case.

He added: 'In fact, one of the main 
claims of the lawsuit is that agents failed to report Garrido's 
marijuana use to the commission so it could decide whether to revocate 
his parole.'

Miss Dugard's lawyer argued that the government's strong-arm tactics was part of a plan to prevent an 
expert witness which would bolster the kidnap victim's case.

Mr Kinsella says that DOJ has told 
him it intends to seek a judicial order barring Dugard's legal team from
hiring any former government workers to serve as expert witnesses.

He added that such an order would be 'dire' for Dugard's case because there are no other experts available.

Locked up: Phillip Garrido and his wife Nancy are serving 431 years and 
36 years respectively for abducting Jaycee and hiding her in the 
backyard of their home. Jaycee had two children by Phillip Garrido

Held: Garrido, a registered sex offender, kept Jaycee Dugard at his Antioch home, pictured, for 18 years

Justice Department officials were unavailable for comment. A hearing has been scheduled for September 10.

Miss Dugard, now 32, and her two children have received a $20 million settlement from state of California.

Jaycee was rescued in 2009, when two 
female police officers became suspicious of Garrido, a convicted rapist,
and summoned the family - including Jaycee's two daughters - to a 
parole meeting.

Garrido was sentenced to 431 years to 
life for the kidnap and rape of Miss Dugard. His wife Nancy was 
sentenced to 36 years to life.
