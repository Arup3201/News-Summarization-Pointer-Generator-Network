Ever swooned over a random passer-by's dress but been too afraid to ask them where they bought it?

A new app, which works in a similar way to Shazam - the music app that identifies a song based on a brief audio clip - aims to help bridge the gap between those shoes you saw on someone at a party and snapping them up for yourself.

ASAP54 uses visual recognition technology, the help of personal stylists, and social media to instantly scout out the exact item you're looking for.

A new app called ASAP54 aims to help fashion fans track down a stranger's outfit at the touch of a button

All you do is take a photo of the item on someone, a piece of fabric or a rip from a magazine and the app scans it and searches for a match in its database.

If it's unable to find what you're after, it suggests a range of similar products and click-through links to buy. It also has a database of stylists on hand who promise to send you five similar suggestions within 24 hours via email.

The London-based company, which claims the free app is designed to be faster and easier than a search engine, was established last year by Daniela Cecilio.

'The idea was born out of my frustration when searching to buy products online,' she told Farfetch.

'Iâ€™m a very visual person and find it hard to describe what I see in words, so Googling was a terrible exercise. I thought there has to be an easier and quicker way.

'I was also looking for a simple way to be connected to what my friends and muses were coveting. I loved the idea of a sneaky peak into other peoples fashion searches that I can turn to for inspiration.'

The start-up, which counts Cara Delevingne as a fan, has already pulled in investment from the likes of Ceyuan Ventures and Novel TMT and has Net-a-Porter, Barneys, Harrods, J Crew, Topshop and The Outnet on its database and has plans to expand.
