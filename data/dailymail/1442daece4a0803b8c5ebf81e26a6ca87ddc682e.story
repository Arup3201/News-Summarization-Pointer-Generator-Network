A protective pit bull named Mamma is being hailed a 'hero' for saving an Ohio family from being burgled.

Tony Byrd, Jr, 32, from Port Clinton heard his 11-year-old canine growling suspiciously just before 11pm on Sunday and went to check the front door.

When he got to the entrance way, he caught sight of someone running off and yelling as they left a trail of blood behind in the snow.

Pup to the rescue: Tony Byrd, Jr, 32, from Port Clinton heard his 11-year-old canine, Mamma, growling suspiciously just before 11pm on Sunday and went to check the front door - the pet saved him from burglary 

The unidentified individual reportedly ran to a dark car parked out the front of Byrd's home and fled the scene after being attacked by Mamma.

Commenting on his trusty pet, Byrd told The Blade: 'She met him right there at the door. She did her job.'

Along with being a security guard, Mamma works as a service dog for Mr Byrd's 11-year-old daughter, Zahara, who has cerebral palsy.

The youngster was apparently upstairs sleeping when the attempted break-in took place. She was joined by the daughter of one of Byrd's friends.

He says Mamma is normally 'sweet' and 'playful' so she must have sensed something bad about the person at the door.

Police are asking hospitals in the Port Clinton area to watch for anyone seeking treatment for dog bites to the arms and hands.

The gender of the suspect is unknown.
