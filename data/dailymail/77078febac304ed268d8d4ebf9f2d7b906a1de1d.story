A Chinese designer has unveiled an extraordinary set of underwear made entirely of gold.

The flashy garments are made of 3 kilograms of the precious metal - and would set you back more than half a million pounds.

But unfortunately for wealthy fashionistas, the two-piece has been produced as a work of art and is not for sale.

Today, a model showed off the dazzling lingerie at a gold shop in Wuhan in central China's Hubei province.

She walked gracefully through the store while modelling the underwear, which took five experienced goldsmiths half a year to make.

The garments are made up of about 5million yuan's (£501,000) worth of gold, according to China News.

The unnamed woman was joined by two other models - both of whom posed with glittering gold accessories, including necklaces, a shoe and a rabbit.

Throughout the day, visitors flocked to the shop to admire the gold products, with many taking photos on their phones.

It is not the first time an everyday item of clothing has been made entirely of gold.

Last week, a Turkish jeweller unveiled a series glamorous gold dresses - each worth a staggering £85,000.

Artisan Ahmet Atakan, based in Izmir, Turkey, crafted each frock out of a total of 78,000 pieces of the expensive metal to form a mesh-like fabric.

Despite the eye-watering price tag of 300 thousand Turkish Liras (about £84,864), eight of the unique gowns have already been sold.

And in May this year, luxury lingerie brand Rococo Dessous - made by former Victoria's Secret designer Breanna Lee - produced a collection of undergarments made from 24-Karat gold thread.

The lavish collection features gilded bras, underwear and nightgowns that all incorporate the thread, which comes from a special Swiss gold fabric.

It takes its inspiration from royal women in history, including Cleopatra, Marie Antoinette and Tsarina Alexandra - with prices ranging from $3,000 (£1,820) to $6,000 (£3,640) for a set.
