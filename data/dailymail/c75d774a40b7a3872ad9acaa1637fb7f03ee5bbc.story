Applauded: Tory Party Chairman Grant Shapps has jumped to the defence of BBC broadcaster John Humphrys

The BBC’s coverage of the Government’s welfare reforms has sought to paint them as ‘Armageddon’ for the nation, a senior minister said yesterday.

Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps accused BBC bosses of letting their ‘personal views take hold’, covering the Coalition’s attempts to rein in the welfare bill as though the world were ending.

He spoke out amid a row over the way the BBC Trust censured respected presenter John Humphrys for a programme exposing the truth about the bloated welfare state.

The Trust condemned the TV show as a breach of its impartiality rules after it discussed the ‘dependency culture’ in Mr Humphrys’ home city of Cardiff, where he found some claimants prefer life on benefits to working.

But Mr Shapps said BBC officials should have ‘applauded’ the Today anchorman and condemned other coverage by the BBC as biased against the Government.

He said the corporation must remain impartial and objective, unlike newspapers which are allowed to hold political views.

‘John Humphrys’ report was a robust analysis of our welfare reforms and he should be applauded not lambasted for his forensic analysis,’ Mr Shapps said.

‘The BBC is not a newspaper and needs to remember it’s a state broadcaster who should be providing an objective analysis of events.

‘Too often it seems the senior management allow their personal views to take hold and cloud their editorial judgment when they don’t agree with a policy.’

He added: ‘There was a weekend last autumn where a number of welfare caps were coming in. Watching the BBC you could have been forgiven for thinking this was Armageddon.

'The broadcast was so unrelentingly over the top. I think that is irresponsible.’

Mr Shapps said the public backs the Government’s cap on welfare payments at £26,000 per family to ensure that those out of work do not get paid more than the average working family.

The BBC said: ‘Inevitably there will be disagreements about the reporting of any given political story, however we are satisfied that our coverage of the welfare reforms was fair, balanced and impartial.’
