Former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said on Thursday that the president and his administration should reconsider putting a temporary moratorium on travel into the U.S. from West Africa.

'I think substantive actions need to be taken, and they may involve flight restrictions, they may involve moving all patients to specific hospitals in the country that can handle Ebola, and I think those would be wise decisions to make,' Carney, now a CNN contributor, said today.

The former Obama flack noted that he's not 'an expert' on the issue before saying a more aggressive approach 'would demonstrate a level of seriousness in response to this that is merited at this point.' 

However, President Obama addressed the issue directly this evening when he said he had no 'philosophical objection' to an travel ban, but that he thought it would do more harm than good.   

Former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said today that his former boss should reconsider putting a temporary moratorium on flights coming into the U.S. from Ebola hot spots

After holding a meeting on the health crisis, the president spoke to reporters and said 'a flat-out travel ban is not the way to go.'

The president has ordered that heightened screening measures be put in place at the international airports where 94 percent of people coming countries afflicted with Ebola enter into the U.S.

‘Now, if we were to put in place a travel ban or a visa ban, it would provide a direct incentive for individuals seeking to travel to the United States to go underground and to seek to evade this screening and to not be candid about their travel history in order to enter the country,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said at an afternoon briefing.

President Obama said Thursday that he has no 'philosophical objection' to a travel ban, but that he thinks it would do more harm than good

'And that means it would be much harder for us keep tabs on these individuals and make sure that they get the screening that's needed to protect them and to protect more importantly the American public,’ he added.

‘And again, it's a relatively small number, about 150 a day that enter this country.’

It's also important to the administration, Earnest said, to keep this line of transportation open because commercial transportation 'is critical' to making sure supplies, equipment and personnel are able to enter the region.

Earnest said as a 'practical matter' a travel ban would make it 'harder for the international community to respond to this incident' because commercial airlines don't want to fly people and items to West Africa just to fly empty planes, with no passengers or cargo, back.

Probed by Fox News' Ed Henry for the White House's thoughts on Carney's suggestion that the administration needs to approach the Ebola outbreak with a higher level of seriousness than it has in the past, Earnest argued that the president and his team's response to the third Ebola diagnosis yesterday 'indicates that that we're deadly serious about this.'

'We're dealing with a deadly disease, and what you are seeing is the kind of tenacious response that the American people are countin' on,' he told Henry.

As far as designating certain hospitals to serve as Ebola treatment centers, Earnest said that was a decision for the CDC.

However, he revealed that it's something 'that CDC is examining right now.' 

Rep. Tim Murphy, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, questions top U.S. health officials about the Ebola outbreak on Capitol Hill today. Murphy endorsed a travel ban and charged that 'screening and self-reporting at airports have been a demonstrated failure'

White House spokesman Josh Earnest was blitzed with questions about the Obama administration's handling of the Ebola crisis today. The Obama administration official said again today that the president would not slap travel restrictions on commercial travel from West Africa to the U.S.

At least 42 members of Congress, including House Speaker John Boehner, have called on the president to halt flights coming out of West Africa. More than two dozen of them signed a letter last week begging the president to budge.

At an emergency congressional hearing on the Ebola crisis today in Washington, D.C., Ohio Rep. Tim Murphy alleged that 'screening and self-reporting at airports have been a demonstrated failure.'

'Yet the administration continues to advance a contradictory reason for this failed policy that frankly doesn’t make sense, especially if "priority one" is to contain the spread of Ebola and protect public health,' he said at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing.

Murphy, the chairman of the subcommittee, estimated that roughly 1,000 people coming from Ebola stricken countries are arriving in the U.S. each week. Any one of them could be an Ebola carrier, he suggested.  

John P. Wagner, the acting assistant commissioner for the Office of Field Operations at the Customs and Border Protection agency assured members of Congress today that 'there are no flights coming to the United States from the affected areas.'

He admitted that 'there's hundreds of flights a day coming from Europe,' however, including flights that connect in Europe with airliners flying out of area's with high rates of Ebola cases. 

CDC Director Thomas Frieden explained that 'many of the people coming to the U.S. from Africa are American citizens.'

'People travel, and people will be coming in,' he explained.

Friden wouldn't say whether or not his agency had discussed a travel ban with the White House, whie indicating that the CDC would be open to the idea.

The CDC does not have the ability to restrict flights or visas, though he said. 'At CDC, our authority is to quarantine individuals or require the isolation of individuals.'

Friden directed members of Congress to the White House for further questions on the possibility of new travel restraints. 

At today's hearing Congressman Fred Upton of Michigan questioned the wisdom of the White House's claims that it won't put a travel ban in place because of how hard it would be send equipment and personnel to West Africa in that scenario.

'Surely we can find other ways to get the aid workers and supplies in to these countries,' he said. 'From terrorist watch lists to quarantines, there are tools used to manage air travel to assure public safety. Why not here? 

'We can no longer be reacting to each day’s crisis. We need to be aggressive and finally get ahead of this outbreak.'

Upton said the administration needs a better plan to treat people who are sick and 'to stop the spread of this disease here at home and at its source in Africa.' 

'This includes travel restrictions from that region beginning today.'

The White House says a travel ban would lead to West Africans to find other ways to enter the country, potentially causing more cases
