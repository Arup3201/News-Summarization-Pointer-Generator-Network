Arsenal and Germany defender Per Mertesacker believes the club’s recent success can inspire him to become a World Champion this summer.

Speaking in an interview with German sport magazine 'kicker', the Arsenal man said the Gunners’ FA Cup win has put him in the mood for more silverware.

'Winning the FA Cup has given me a lot of confidence. It has set me up to get another highlight, something which I can definitely achieve' he said.

Mertesacker sets off for Brazil with the German national team next week, and is expected to retain his role as a first choice centre back under coach Joachim Low. Despite a chaotic pre-tournament period for Germany, Mertesacker remains fixed on the title.

'We want to go further than we have been in previous competitions,' he said, 'those who have watched us know what that means. We don’t want to constantly only reach third place.'

Many in Germany are more pessimistic about the team’s chances, with coach Low having to fight a plague of injuries as well as exceptional problems such as a car accident during a publicity event at Germany’s training camp.

But Mertesacker said that he is 'not at all concerned' and cites his success at Arsenal as being at the root of his confidence.

'The last season was definitely the best I have had since I joined Arsenal. I was injury free and was playing regularly. I now feel I have arrived in England, that I have made something of myself there.'

The German’s time at Arsenal has not only seen him establish himself in the Premier League, but also in the national team. Prior to joining the North London club, Mertesacker was seen as having been usurped in the German defence by the likes of Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng.

Since his rise at Arsenal, though, it is Hummels and Boateng who are fighting it out to play alongside Mertesacker.

The centre back is not alone in his happiness at Arsenal, meanwhile. Fellow Arsenal and Germany star Lukas Podolski has also recently stated that 'Arsenal was absolutely the right step for me. It has been an amazing two years in London.'
