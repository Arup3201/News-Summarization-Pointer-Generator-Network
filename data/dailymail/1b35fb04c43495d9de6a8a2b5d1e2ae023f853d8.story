It was a day Bella Davison's parents feared they would never see - their daughter home for the first time.

The six-month-old was born a week before the legal abortion limit at only 23 weeks into her mother's pregnancy, weighing just over 1lb - the same as a bag of sugar.

Doctors are advised not to resuscitate babies born before 23 weeks and her parents, Vicky Jackson and Graeme Davison, an electrician, were told by doctors to prepare for the worst.

But their daughter fought hard to survive and is now thriving.

Today she left hospital after spending her entire life under the care of medics at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary.

When Bella was born weighing just over 1lb, the same as a bag of sugar (pictured top) doctors told her parents to fear the worst. But Bella survived and is now thriving, weighing a healthy  12lb 11oz (bottom)

Ms Jackson, 30, of Morpeth, Northumberland, said: 'It was very emotional to bring Bella home as there was a time when we thought this might not happen.

'The day after Bella was born we were told she would not survive the night but she did and now she is home - it's amazing.

'It is great to see how well Bella's doing as she looks like any other baby, and you would not know that she was premature, she is just a little miracle.

Ms Jackson is now calling for the abortion limit to be lowered. 

She said: 'I think the abortion limit should be significantly lowered to 10 weeks unless there is a medical reason.

'Bella shows that babies can survive at 23 weeks old if they are given a fighting chance.

'More premature babies are surviving all the time due to advances in medical treatment.'

Earlier this week MailOnline reported on the story of baby Jet Morris, who was born prematurely at 25 weeks weighing just 1.4lbs - having survived for five weeks in the womb after his mother's waters broke.

Doctors had advised mother Mhairi Morris, 34 that the pregnancy was 'non- viable - and prepared her for a termination.

But she and husband Paul defied doctors' advice - and believe had it not been for their determination, Jett - who is thriving and recently celebrated his first birthday - would not be here today.

Bella and her twin sister Sophia were born by Caesarean section at Wansbeck General Hospital, four months before their due date.

But Sophia suffered complications and doctors were unable to save her.

Ms Jackson said: 'We are devastated that Sophia did not make it.

Bella's plight has attracted followers from around the world, after her mother started a blog about her daughter's fight for life. Ms Jackson has received messages of support from as far away as America

'But we are very lucky that Bella is here with us as there was a chance that we would not have either of our daughters.

'The last time Bella was weighed she was 12lb 11oz and she's doing well.'

'Bella 100 per cent wanted to be here and she has just dealt with everything, she has such a strong little character.'

Bella will continue to be regularly seen by nurses and she will be monitored by experts to see if she is developing as expected.

There is a possibility that she may have mild cerebral palsy and slight developmental problems following a bleed to her brain at just one day old.

Ms Jackson said: 'Like any first-time parent, I am a little nervous having her home and I'm constantly watching her to check that she's OK.

'But it's very exciting and I'm used to sleepless nights as I've been staying with Bella in hospital.'

Ms Jackson's Facebook posts about her Beautiful Bella and life on the Special Care Baby Unit was started initially to give family and friends daily updates on her daughter's condition as her life hung in the balance.

But messages of support have come from across the Atlantic as far away as Texas, America.

Ms Jackson and Mr Davison, 38, both former students at King Edward VI school in Morpeth, said the online support they have received had been a great source of strength.

'Some of the messages we get from people around the world are really inspirational,' said Ms Jackson.

'Some of them are from people who have been or are going through similar situations.'

The couple pledged to raise vital funds for Tiny Lives to thank the charity for its help and support. A charity night at Gala Bingo in Cramlington, Northumberland, helped to raise more than £200.

'We wanted to raise money for Tiny Lives to say thank you for all their help, but also to try and help save the lives of more premature babies,' said Ms Jackson.

'They fund research and equipment but also facilities for the families and support with financial costs like the daily hospital parking charges.'
