Spanish police have come under fire for sending divers to inspect a concrete reef in Gibraltan waters who then took underwater pictures of themselves unfurling the Spanish flag.

The divers then posted the images on Twitter while Spain's Guardia Civil police released footage of the diving stunt last night.

Gibraltar has accused the police of violating 'British sovereignty' by attempting to exercise jurisdiction in its territory.Scroll down for video

Incursion: A Spanish police diver hold up the Spanish flag while inspecting one of the concrete blocks dropped by the Gibraltan government off the coast to encourage marine life

Contentious: The Spanish Civil Guard (Guardia Civil) last night released footage of divers inspecting concrete blocks dropped into waters surrounding Gibraltar to encourage more marine life

Breach: The diving stunt has been criticised by the Gibraltan government who accused the Spanish police of a 'serious incursion' into British Gibratar territorial waters

Gibraltar Governor Sir Adrian Johns said: 'The act of diving itself constituted a serious violation of British sovereignty but this apparent interference with the reef is a new and worrying aspect.'

The police divers can be seen in the footage apparently measuring some of the 74 concrete blocks which were dropped into the sea by Gibraltar last month to make a man-made reef and encourage marine life.

Spain wants the reef removed, claiming it prevents Spanish fishermen from accessing the waters surrounding Gibraltar.

The Gibraltar government said in a statement: 'Her Majesty's Government of Gibraltar notes the incident of executive action taken by the guardia civil in British Gibraltar territorial waters in the area of the new artificial reef.

'The matter of this serious incursion will not assist in de-escalating the present tensions.'

Olive branch: Gibraltar's First Minister Fabian Picardo has promising to let Spanish fishermen return to British waters

It comes as Gibraltar's chief minister attempts to defuse the bitter dispute with Spain by promising to let its 
fishermen return to British waters.

Fabian Picardo is to propose a change in local law to let them resume fishing in parts of the sea near the Rock.

The
law change allows them to ‘fish again according to their ancient 
practice’. It will be greeted as a victory by the 59 Spanish boats that 
want to use the waters.

They
include one called Divina Providencia – Divine Providence in English – 
whose skipper Francisco Gomez has been involved in numerous 
confrontations with Royal Gibraltar Police vessels.

He
and his colleagues want access to waters closer to shore so they can 
catch better quality shellfish.

He was charged by the Gibraltar 
authorities in May for ‘entry into British waters, illegal fishing, 
reckless navigation and failure to respect the authorities’.

Tensions
have also been building over the last 18 months because Mr Picardo 
started enforcing a 1991 environmental protection law.

That law banned some nets used by Spanish fishermen,  including drift nets and gill nets.

Mr
Picardo’s move is the clearest hint yet that Gibraltar may be prepared 
to compromise on certain types of nets after 14 months of meetings with 
fishermen and local Spanish mayors.

But
Mr Picardo insisted the law change has nothing to do with Spain’s 
border security checks that have caused a political outcry amid six-hour
queues in and out of the British territory.

Protest: Spanish fishermen staged a protest this week at the site of an 
artificial reef built in Algeciras Bay, which they say ruins traditional
fishing grounds

Row: A fleet of 38 Spanish fishing boats sailed towards Gibraltar last weekend to demand the British outpost remove 70 concrete blocks it has
dropped in their fishing grounds

He
said: ‘The Spanish government’s politically motivated queues at the 
frontier and the threats made about Gibraltar have not and will not 
succeed in changing the position of Her Majesty’s Government of 
Gibraltar.

‘In the same way as such tactics will not serve to “soften” Gibraltar, neither will we allow them to harden our position.’

He also insisted that 70 controversial concrete blocks dumped in the sea to create an artificial reef would remain.

The area where the reef has been created will also remain off-limits to fishing.

But
Mr Picardo ruled out any surrender last night by saying: 'We have 
decided the blocks shouldn't be moved because we are not doing anything 
that really affects the fishermen's ability to fish.'

Gibraltar
claims three nautical miles around the Rock as its own. Spain insists 
the waters outside of Gibraltar's port belong to them.

Fishermen will not be allowed to return to the area where the artificial reef has been created.
