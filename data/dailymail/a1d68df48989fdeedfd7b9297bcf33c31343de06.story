New book 'substantially contradicts' Truman Capote's In Cold Blood

Files from the investigation into the murders that inspired Truman Capote's In Cold Blood are set to be published in a book which 'substantially contradicts' Capote's version

Ronald Nye's father, a Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent, kept detailed notes and photographs from the investigation into the 1959 killings that inspired Capote's bestselling book.

In 2012, the Kansas attorney general's office sued Nye to block him from publishing his father's files, but this has now been lifted.

In a ruling made public Monday, Shawnee County District Court Judge Larry Hendricks said he made an error when he initially blocked publication of the criminal investigation files in 2012. 

Mr Nye, of Oklahoma City, is the son of Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent Harold Nye, who features in Truman Capote's non-fiction novel In Cold Blood from 1966.

The book follows the investigation into the 1959 murders of prominent farmer and community leader Herbert Clutter, his wife Bonnie, and their tow youngest children, Kenyon, 15, and 16-year-old Nancy,  at their rural farmhouse in Holcomb, Kansas.

The hunt for their killers mesmerized the nation, drawing journalists from across the United States . to the small, western Kansas town, including Capote and his life-long friend Harper Lee.

Parolees Richard 'Dick' Hickock, 33, and Perry Smith, 36, were found guilty of the murders, and executed by hanging in 1965.

Capote's book about the crime has been a bestseller for decades, and inspired a movie of the same name.

Mr Nye says  his father Harold was so disappointed in Capote's book that he read only about 115 pages before throwing it across the room. 

He said his father walked out of the movie's premiere after just 15 minutes.

On Monday, Judge Hendricks ruled Mr Nye's First Amendment right to publish the material outweigh the government's interest in maintaining the confidentiality of its investigative records.

Mr Nye and co-author Gary McAvoy would not reveal exactly what is in the files, but Mr Nye said his father's notebooks had 'vast discrepancies' from what Capote wrote.

'Our belief is that there is no other reason (Kansas) would want the materials we have suppressed were it not for the information we found in them,' McAvoy said.

 'That information connects to other research I've done and supports a pretty compelling new theory — one that I am reluctant to even discuss at this point.'

The state's lawsuit also asked the court to decide legal ownership of the case files. The judge has made no ruling on that issue.

The judge wrote that Kansas had not shown a legal justification for suppressing the material or for interfering with the public's right to know what is in them. He also rejected the state's argument that the Clutter family's privacy concerns justified blocking their release.

'The court is sensitive to the plaintiff's concern about publicity and its effect on the Clutters,' Hendricks wrote. 'However, publicity continues to follow this case even fifty-five years after its occurrence.'

O. Yale Lewis, Jr., an attorney for Nye and McAvoy, said his clients hope to have their book published in time for the 50th anniversary in September of the publication of Capote's book.
