Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have released gruesome new images of alleged thieves having their hands hacked off in front of crowds bloodthirsty onlookers.

The photographs were taken in ISIS stronghold Mosul and show in gruesome detail how the terrorists pump their victims full of drugs before using a massive meat cleaver to cut off the hands.

Hundreds of people are seen lining the streets of the oil-rich city to get a better view of the barbaric act, which is carried out by several masked militants led by a white-bearded elderly man named Abu Ansar al-Ansari, who appears to be orchestrating proceedings.

Photographs of the horrific punishments are being shared by pro-ISIS social media users, who use the Arabic file sharing website Nasher to exchange images of the terror group's latest atrocities.

The images begin by showing charge sheets carrying ISIS' chilling black and white logo which accuse the prisoners of stealing.

Crowds of men are then shown lining the streets to witness the savage punishments, with young boys clambering on to their father's shoulders in order to get a better view.

Keeping the baying crowd in line are dozens of heavily armed militants, who wear military fatigues as they stand facing the onlookers in an intimidating fashion.

The next shots showing in gruesome detail the medical preparation for the sickening amputations. The men's arms are pumped full of drugs and wrapped in tight bandages both to lessen the agony of the sickening act and to reduce the amount of blood flowing from the open wound.

While most of those involved cover their faces, one elderly militant known as Abu Ansar al-Ansari does not cover his thick white beard as he oversees the entire atrocity.

The distinctive fighter has become notorious in recent months after appearing in numerous videos released by ISIS showing their barbaric acts.

After having his hand hacked off, the victim is seen receiving medical treatment to ensure the wound does not become infected. 

His arm is wrapped in thick bandages and more anaesthetising drugs are seen being pumped into his body to numb the pain before he is driven away from the crowds in the back of a van.

The images emerged just days after similar photographs taken in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa showed a terrified young man being dragged into a public square to have his hand cut off.

The blindfolded victim was forced to sit in a chair in the centre of the square, where he was held in place by one of the jihadis, while two others use a cleaver to brutally sever his hand from his arm.

The horrific images were shared on the Twitter page of the local  activist group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, who work undercover in the city to expose the atrocities committed by ISIS.

The four photographs are high quality shots and carry the distinctive yellow branding of ISIS' Al-Hayat Media Center, suggesting they may be stills from an as-yet unreleased propaganda video.
