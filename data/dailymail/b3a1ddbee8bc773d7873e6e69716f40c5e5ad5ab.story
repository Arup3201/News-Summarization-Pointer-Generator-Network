Two gangland IRA drug dealers were 
shot dead and their bodies burned in a van and buried on a Cornish farm, an inquest heard.

Former cage fighter Thomas Haigh, 26,
was jailed for a minimum of 35 years for shooting dead David Griffiths,
35, and former boxer Brett Flournoy, 31, on the remote farm in Cornwall 
in June 2011.

Ross Stone, 28, who was cleared of 
murder, was jailed for five years after he admitted burning the men’s 
bodies and burying them in a huge pit at Sunny Corner farm at Trenance 
Downs near St Austell.

Yesterday Cornwall coroner Dr Emma 
Carlyon recorded unlawful killing verdicts at an inquest held in Truro 
to settle unanswered questions about exactly how the men were killed and
their bodies disposed of.

The bodies of Flournoy, 31, from The 
Wirral, and Griffiths, from Berkshire, were unearthed by police after 
Stone confessed to having disposed of the corpses.

Today's inquest heard father-of-three Griffiths, and pro boxer Flournoy were killed with a 12-bore shotgun by Haigh.

His 'thick' accomplice Ross Stone, 26, then stuffed the bodies into a Citroen Berlingo, set it alight and buried the vehicle in a pit at the farm where he worked, it was said.

The inquest heard the two victims worked for an IRA gang that ran Liverpool’s illegal drugs trade and Haigh and Stone owed them £40,000.

The dealers wanted Haigh to pay them back by travelling to Brazil to bring back cocaine.

But when Flournoy and Griffiths arrived at Stone’s farm on June 16, 2011, Haigh blasted them with a shotgun.

Haigh and Stone tried to cover their tracks with the DIY cremation but Stone later told officers where the charred remains were buried.

Despite their convictions, an inquest attempted to resolve unanswered questions about how Griffiths and Flournoy died and exactly how their bodies were destroyed.

Detective Constable Steve Hambly of Devon and Cornwall Police told the hearing the pair were shot in the back and the face.

DC Hambly said: 'I believe Brett Flournoy suffered one shot to his back and this shot proved fatal. It may have taken place close to the farmhouse.

'I believe that David Griffiths suffered a fatal shot to his right shoulder and on the side of his face.

'There is no evidence that they survived past June 16, 2011 or that a third person was connected to the murders.

'In my opinion, the deaths of these two men resulted in a fall out whilst the four of them were involved in a global enterprise - a drugs supply.'

During his trial it emerged Stone, who lived at the farm where he worked as a digger driver, had links with large-scale suppliers in Merseyside.

He would buy cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy before selling them on locally but trouble began when drugs worth £40,000 went missing from his home.

The drugs disappeared but the dealers
who had supplied them, Flournoy and Griffiths, still wanted their money
and went to the farm.

Flournoy, of Bebington on the Wirral, Merseyside, and Griffiths, 35, from Bracknell, Berkshire, were then shot by Haigh.

His
trial later heard Haigh had been placed at the farm as a lodger by the 
two gang members to keep an eye on 'thick Cornish farmer' Stone.

But Haigh killed them with a shotgun and Stone then scooped the two corpses into a wheelbarrow before using heavy machinery to dig a massive grave, the inquest heard.

He then put the pair in their van and set it alight before rolling it into the pit and later covering it over.

Stone later admitted 'tidying up' afterwards - including dumping the shotgun and blotting up pools of blood in the farm lane using cement powder.

The makeshift grave went undiscovered for several weeks until Stone was arrested on an unrelated drugs charge.

He confessed to helping destroy the bodies but denied taking part in the shootings. Haigh, of Huddersfield, fled back to Yorkshire before eventually handing himself in.

Coroner Emma Carlyon said: 'Brett Flournoy and David Griffiths travelled to Cornwall to visit Sunny Corner at Trenance Downs near St Austell.

'This was with the view to commit criminal or drug activities. The remains of their bodies was located in their badly burnt vehicle, a Citroen Berlingo van which was buried in a pit on the grounds of Sunny Corner.

'Other bone fragments of the men were found close to the van. The two men were shot with a gun, not recovered, and buried in their van which was burnt.'

She recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.
