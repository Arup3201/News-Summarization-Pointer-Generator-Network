Families who have been exposed to violent crimes and tragic suicides have become victims twice – as some allege they have been taken advantage of by a bio-hazard clean-up firm that quoted one price but charged thousands more.

Aftermath Inc, a company that takes on the grim task of cleaning up homes where people have been murdered or committed suicide, is being sued by five families in Texas.

They claim that the company took advantage of them in their darkest hour, charging as much as ten times their quoted price.

Taken advantage: Steve Randall, left, was charged more than $43,000 by Aftermath after his stepson Aaron Wilks, right, committed suicide in his Texas home in March

Small fortune: Randall said the rate he was charged was exponentially higher than the $5,000 to $8,000 he was quoted

Steve Randall alleges that the company quoted him $5,000 to $8,000 to clean up his home after his 30-year-old stepson Aaron Wilks killed himself in the stepfather’s Toyah, Texas home in March.

KHOU in Houston reported that Mr Wilks had been depressed before he took his life – he had just left the Army, was going through a bitter divorce, and did not have a job.

After Mr Randall was referred to Aftermath by a sheriff’s deputy, he arranged a time for the company to clean up the room.

That included removing the carpet and cleaning the walls.

Mr Randall said an Aftermath employee told him that they were a bio-hazard company, not a cleaning crew. But the grieving stepfather had other things weighing heavy on his mind.

‘He was talking and I wasn’t listening,’ Mr Randall told KHOU. ‘I mean, this was 10 to 12 hours after my son had done this.’

When he got the bill, he was flabbergasted – it was for more than $43,000.

Mr Randall’s attorney, Ted Lyon, told KHOU: ‘(Aftermath takes) advantage at a vulnerable time, then come back and prey on them to the tune of 40 to 50-thousand dollars to clean up a room.’

Hazards of the job: Aftermath said haz-mat workers are required to take long breaks because of the stifling nature of the suits

Hard work: A spokesperson for Aftermath said the cleaning is thorough and much more than a simple sweep, since they are often dealing with gruesome scenes

According to Courthouse News Service, other families are suing the company for similar grievances. The prices quoted to the grieving family members were inflated as much as 300 to 1,000 times, court papers say.

The documents allege that workers took advantage of their hourly rate, often working for 15 minutes out of the hour, and taking 45 minute breaks, and reported charges for supplies that were not used in the clean-ups. 

‘The claims are completely frivolous,’ Aftermath spokesperson Laura McGowan told MailOnline. ‘These are also people who gave us perfect scores on the jobs we did for them.’

She said the clean-up the company does is much more labour intensive than the average scrub down. ‘The work we do requires more than a mop and a bucket. We follow every guideline with dealing with biohazards,’ she said.

The company's official statement read: 'Each customer signs a written agreement detailing Aftermath’s fees. At the conclusion of each job, the customer approves, in writing, the final number of hours worked and the tasks accomplished.

'Thereafter, each receives an invoice reflecting the agreed upon charges.  There are no hidden fees.'

Aftermath told KHOU that they stand by their service fees, citing unexpected costs and labour needed to return a scene to normal.

But Mr Randall is not the only alleged victim of overcharging. Regine Revelus was billed $32,571.75 for crime-scene clean-up in her Milton, Massachusetts home following a gruesome 2009 killing spree.

Moment of grief: Mother Regine Revelus had the grim task of cleaning up her home after her 23-year-old son shot dead his two younger sisters and was killed by cops; it happened in 2009

Caught: Revelus was billed $32,571.75 and a lien was put on her home before she contacted her insurance company

Her 23-year-old son had murdered two of his younger sisters before he was shot by police. Ms Revelus could be seen at the time crying out in pain and crumpling to the ground.

She told WHDH in Boston last November that before she could send the bill to her insurance company, Aftermath had already put a lien on her home.

The clean-up should have cost half the amount, according to expert estimates.

The station reported that Aftermath put liens on 41 other Massachusetts homes since 2006.

‘If they put a lien on your house, that’s mean,’ Ms Revelus told the station.

Aftermath says on its website that ‘cheaper isn’t always better,’ and adds: ‘Cutting corners can result in the return of dangerous biological colonies, which may lead to further damage or the potential of a lawsuit if an exposure incident occurs.

'Aftermath does not cut corners. We use industry-specific, specially formulated chemicals and follow all federal, state, local laws, in addition to best-practice standards and the "Aftermath Way".’
