Martin Kaymer has begun dating Sky Sports News presenter Kirsty Gallacher.

A source told The Sun on Sunday that Gallacher has spent time with German golfer Kaymer since splitting up with former rugby ace Paul Sampson.

Gallacher, who split from Sampson in August, has reportedly been on two dates with Kaymer after being introduced to the golfer, who is known as the 'Ice Man', by her cousin Stephen.

Gallacher and Paul Sampson's 14-year relationship came to an end in August

Sampson played for the likes of Wasps and London Welsh before announcing his retirement in 2011

Stephen Gallacher, who is also a professional golfer, brought the pair together during the Ryder Cup in November. 

The duo ' reportedly hit it off' straight away but are not yet officially an item. A source told The Sun: 'Kirsty has had a really tough year with the breakdown of her marriage. She is going through a difficult time with her divorce. 

'Now hopefully she has found something to make her smile again. She is single for the first time in 14 years and she is allowed to have some fun. 

'There is plenty of flirting going on and they are clearly very fond of each other.'

Gallacher had been with Sampson for 10 years before they tied the know in 2010. The couple have two children and have been living together in the family's mansion in Surrey before Sampson moved out when their relationship hit the rocks.
