When it comes to a wedding, the bride's deepest fear is that the groom may croak at the last minute.

But in the village of Assam, India, it is a common sound during the traditional frog weddings.

The union between the two amphibians is carried out in a bid to invoke rain for the harvest season and watched by hundreds of people from the surrounding villages.

Two groups of women separately bath the males and female frogs, and then dress them in clothes and jewellery for the wedding.

The bride is even made to wear a handmade necklace during the ritual conducted by a Hindu priest.

Weather in the region is expected to remain hot and sunny for the next seven days, with highs of 35C. But then, showers and storms are on their way.
