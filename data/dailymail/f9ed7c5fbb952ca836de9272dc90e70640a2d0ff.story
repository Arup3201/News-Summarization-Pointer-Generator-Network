He may be an action man, but for the moment Harrison Ford will have to sit while someone else does all the hard work.

The star has been confined to a wheelchair after breaking his foot on the set of the latest Star Wars film.

Seen for the first time since the accident, Ford, 71, had his left foot in plaster as he prepared to jet back from London to the US for rehabilitation.

The star has been confined to the wheelchair after breaking his foot on the set of the latest Star Wars film

Seen for the first time since the accident, Ford, 71, had his left foot in plaster as he prepared to jet back from London to the US for rehabilitation

His leg was crushed nine days ago by the door of the Millennium Falcon, the spacecraft that his character pilots in the sci-fi epic.

He was airlifted from the Pinewood Studios set to Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital and later had surgery in London.

Producers at Disney have insisted filming will continue while he recovers.

He then made his way into a waiting car. It is nearly 40 years since Ford starred in the first Star Wars film in 1977

Speaking shortly before his accident, the American star described himself as a ‘battered old Ford’ and said he prefers to do his own action stunts.

He said: ‘I keep on coming back for more. If it doesn’t look real on the screen then an audience does not believe what it sees.’

The actor, who has also pulled muscles and damaged a disc in his back during the Indiana Jones films, added: ‘Although I do my own running, jumping and falling, I always try to keep myself from being hurt. So I know what will work and what won’t.’

It is nearly 40 years since Ford starred in the first Star Wars film in 1977. Star Wars: Episode VII, which is being directed by JJ Abrams, began filming in Abu Dhabi in mid-May.

The action is set 35 years after the last film they all appeared in together - 1983’s Return of the Jedi.

It will be the first Star Wars title released by Disney, after creator George Lucas sold the rights to the franchise in 2012.

When it was rumoured that Ford may take part in a fifth Indiana Jones film last year, he shrugged off suggestions he is too old to take on the action role.

He said: ‘I don’t think there is any barrier to Indiana Jones being an old fart. I’m old enough that we don’t need [Sean] Connery anymore – I’m old enough to play my own father.’

Star Wars: Episode VII is scheduled for release in December next year.
