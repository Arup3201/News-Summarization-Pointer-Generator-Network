Sheer walls drop down a quarter of a mile into a giant lake of lava which appears to breathe in and out as its crusts melts and reforms.

The lake's hypnotic patterns are revealed in these incredible photos that show billowing smoke and lava bubbles bursting from its surface.

The amazing spectacle in war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo is rarely seen as the conflict means the lake is difficult to reach.

Hidden in the depths of Mount Nyiragongo, climbers must trek to an altitude of nearly 11,400ft (3.47km) to catch a glimpse of the lava lake.

Nyiragongo is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, erupting on average every 30 years, according to programmer Mikhail Korostelev.

He ventured to the edge of the crater with wife Anastasia, 28, and the couple enjoyed the view for 20 minutes until it clouded over with smoke.

Mr Korostelev, 32, from Moscow, Russia, said: 'We did not expect to see this incredible spectacle until the last few metres of ascent.

Despite being one of the world’s most active volcanoes, Nyiragongo is also one of the least studied. In 1977 lava shot down the mountain at more than 60 miles an hour (97 km/h), the fastest ever lava flow recorded 

Mr Korostelev, 32, from Moscow, Russia, said: 'We did not expect to see this incredible spectacle until the last few metres of ascent. We crawled to the edge of the crater and could not believe our eyes - the lava lake existed'

Mount Nyiragongo is an active volcano 11,382ft (3,470 metres) high. 

It is located in Virunga National Park, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, around 12 miles (20 km) north of the town of Goma.

Despite being one of the world’s most active volcanoes, Nyiragongo is also one of the least studied.

Since 1882, the volcano has erupted at least 34 times. The lava emitted in eruptions at Nyiragongo is often unusually fluid, scientists claim.

In 2002, Mount Nyiragongo caused 400,000 people to be evacuated from the city across the Rwandan border into neighbouring Gisenyi.

'We crawled to the edge of the crater and could not believe our eyes - the lava lake existed.

'After it clouded over, we couldn't see anything for the rest of night so we began to descend the following morning after a night in a hut.’

Despite being one of the world’s most active volcanoes, Nyiragongo is also one of the least studied.

In 1977 lava shot down the mountain at more than 60 miles an hour (97 km/h), the fastest ever lava flow recorded.

Despite the flow hardening before it reached the main part of the city, several hundred people died as a result.

In 2002 the volcano released more lava into nearby Goma, obliterating 14,000 homes and forcing 350,000 citizens to be evacuated.

'The lava lake in the crater acts almost constantly and the crater has sheer walls around 328ft (100m) high,’ said Mr Korstelev.

'Therefore it is impossible to get closer without special equipment - so we were about 656ft (200m) away from the lake.

'This is not an eruption but the lava lake is active almost all the time.'
