Jacqueline Whylly, of Minnesota, experienced any parent’s worst nightmare this week when she was told that her toddler son was left behind on a field trip.

Whylly’s son, 4-year-old AJ, was taken with his classmates to visit the Children's Museum of South Dakota in Brookings Tuesday.

Teachers didn't realize the toddler, who has speech impediment issues, was missing until they were back in Marshall, about an hour away.

Left behind: AJ, age four, pictured right with his family, was abandoned while on a school trip to a South Dakota museum, and no one realized the boy was not on the bus until an hour later 

Mom outraged: Jacqueline Whylly, the boy's mother, said her son was neglected, and no one was responsible for him

The boy’s mother said no one was accountable for her son.

'Anyone could have took [sic] him,' Whylly said. 'He was neglected and alone.'

To
add insult to injury, Whylly said she had offered her son's school 
officials to accompany the students on the trip, but was told that they 
had enough adults.

Marshall Superintendent Klint Willert
offered his ‘sincere apologies’ to the mother and son when he talked to KARE-TV and said rules for field trips were not followed.

He said students are to be counted before they get on the bus and again after they've boarded, which apparently did not happen.

A meeting with district administrators was expected to take place Thursday morning to review field trip procedures.

Trip gone awry: AJ and his classmates were visiting the Children's Museum of South Dakota when the boy was left behind

Long way to go: School officials did not realize the 4-year-old was not on the bus until they arrived back in Marshall, Minnesota, 63 miles away from the museum, about an hour later

Willert also said that the teacher who was chaperoning the field trip will be disciplined for failing to count the students on the bus.

Meanwhile, Whylly said she will keep her son home until she is satisfied that changes are being made.
