New footage has emerged showing Joran van der Sloot, the prime suspect in the disappearance of American teen Natalee Holloway, in his Peruvian maximum-security prison.

In one shot, the 27-year-old Dutch national, who has gone on hunger strike to protest the conditions in the prison, shows off his new Mohawk hairstyle and beard as he explains he is filming 'for my own security'.

Another scene on the video, which was released by Reuters on Tuesday, shows him being patted down by guards against a wall and having his blood pressure tested.

The footage is from inside the Challapalca Maximum Security Prison, near the Bolivian border, where van der Sloot was sent  10 days ago after allegedly threatening a guard for confiscating his phone.

Last week, he reportedly went on hunger strike to protest conditions,NBC reported as it shared the video.

He is serving a 28-year sentence after admitting to the murder of Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old Peruvian business student in 2010.

He was also the last person seen with Alabama high school student Natalee Holloway, who vanished while on a graduation trip to Aruba in 2005. No charges have been filed against him in the case.

Van der Sloot is expected to remain in prison until 2038 and then be extradited to the U.S. to face charges of extortion and fraud for allegedly falsely promising to lead Holloway's mother to the girl's body in exchange for payment.

The teenager's body has never been found.

In July, the killer married his heavily-pregnant Peruvian, Leidy Figueroa, girlfriend in a prison ceremony. 

The couple met in prison, where Figueroa, a trained accountant with a young son from a previous relationship, sells candy and cigarettes to inmates. 

'They became friends and spent a lot of time together in his cell,' his attorney Maximo Altez told CNN. 'Unlike the United States, here in Peru, loved ones or relatives can see inmates inside their jails.'

Prison officials prohibited video and photos during their midday nuptials and none of the groom's relatives attended, Altez said.

Van der Sloot told his bride that when he gets out of prison, 'I want to marry you again,' and she told him the same,' said John Barrera, who officiated the wedding. 

Figueroa is due to give birth to Van der Sloot's child in September. All prisoners at the penitentiary are allowed conjugal visits, explaining Figueroa's pregnancy.   

She told CBS News' Crimesider earlier this year that she usually visits Van der Sloot twice a week and brings him home-cooked meals.

She said he has become a new person and is enjoying his prison arts and crafts classes.
