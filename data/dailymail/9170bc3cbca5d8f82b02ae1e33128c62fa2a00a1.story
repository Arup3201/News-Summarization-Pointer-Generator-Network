Rare: Elvis wrote the poignant letter in 1958 - while he was on national service in Germany, pictured

He had just lost his mother and was living thousands of miles from home in a foreign country.

So it’s fair to say that Elvis was feeling genuinely lonesome the night he wrote an emotional letter to his friends.

Aged 23 and doing his national service in Germany, he  sent the rare note home in 1958 telling them how homesick he was and how much he missed his mother Gladys who had died three months earlier.

He also spoke of his frustration at having to postpone his burgeoning singing career for the two years he spent in the US military.

The two-page handwritten letter was addressed to a 15-year-old girl called Frances Forbes, but was meant for a whole group of friends back home in Memphis, Tennessee.

It has been in the hands of a private collector from Hertfordshire for many years, but has now come up for sale.

Richard Davies, of International Autograph Auctions, said: ‘Elvis’s cousin once said that if Elvis had written ten letters in his lifetime, then that would have been a lot.

‘This is the first handwritten letter by Elvis that I have ever come across. They are like gold dust.

'The content of this letter is superb. It is very personal to him and shows him to be quite vulnerable in the aftermath of his mother’s death.

Letter: The sad note reflects what the Elvis felt privately while he was in Germany and away from his friends and loved-ones

‘He wrote about being lonely and homesick, about his mother’s death and about getting home  to Gracelands.

‘It does reveal a vulnerable and 
tender side to him. We have had a lot of interest in it and we expect it
to go for more than the pre-sale estimate of £3,000.’

Elvis’s reluctance to put pen to paper
was reflected in the opening line of the note.

He wrote: ‘Well I don’t 
know what ever made me decide to write a letter but I guess it’s because
I am so homesick and lonely.

‘I just want to tell you that I miss 
and love you all very much and I am just counting the hours untill [sic]
I can return and we will all be together again.

‘I can hardly wait till I am back 
singing and making movies, and above all seeing the old gang again.

'I 
guess I miss mother more over here than anything because I am just now 
realizing that she won’t ever be here anymore.’

He went on to ask his friends to pass 
on his regards to ‘everybody at Gracelands’ and finished by saying: ‘I 
just wanted you all to know that I am thinking of you.’

Although he was eight years older 
than her, it is thought Elvis had a relationship with Frances Forbes at 
the time she received the letter in November 1958.

She held on to the note for many years and provided a letter of provenance when it was sold to the English collector.

Although Elvis’s loneliness was clear at the time he wrote the letter, it did not last long.

In September 1959, he met Priscilla 
Wagner, the 14-year-old stepdaughter of a US Air Force officer based in 
Germany. The pair fell in love and eventually married in 1966.

The auction of the letter takes place in Marbella, Spain, today.
