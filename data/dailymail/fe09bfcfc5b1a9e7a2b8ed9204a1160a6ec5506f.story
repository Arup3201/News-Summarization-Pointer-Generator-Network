A cyclone warning has been declared for the coastal and island communities of the eastern Top End as Tropical Cyclone Lam slowly moves towards the coast.

The warning extends through parts of Arnhem Land from Nhulunbuy to Cape Shield.

The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a cyclone watch from Maningrida to Nhulunbuy and Cape Shield to Numbulwar, including Groote Eylandt.

The bureau said gales with gusts of up to 110 kph were expected along the coast between Nhulunbuy and Cape Shield early on Wednesday, and could become very destructive with gusts of more than 170 kph.

Tropical Cyclone Lam is currently 305 kilometres east northeast of Nhulunbuy and 430 kilometres northeast of Alyangula, moving slowly west northwest.

If it stays over water for another few days, it could strengthen to a category three or four storm.

The Northern Territory's Emergency Management Committee will meet on Tuesday, said Commander Bruce Porter, Region 2 Regional Controller from the NT Police, Fire, and Emergency Services.

He said local emergency plans have been activated and authorities are well prepared.

He advised communities on cyclone watch to put together emergency kits, clear their yards and begin preparing their home shelters.

They should have at least three litres of water per person per day for at least 72 hours, as well as filling up vehicles' fuel tanks, and any available jerry cans.

'Check that your friends, family and neighbours have heard and understood the messages, particularly new arrivals or those who may not fully understand English,' Commander Porter said in a statement.

No one should proceed to emergency shelters until advised by authorities.

'If you do not have accommodation constructed to the building code or are unsure of your present accommodation, you should determine now where you will shelter,' he said.

'This may include arranging to shelter with family, friends or in public emergency shelters, or strong buildings, where available in your community.'
