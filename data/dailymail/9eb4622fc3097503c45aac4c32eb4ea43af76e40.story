Players, pundits and fans leapt to the defence of Nacer Chadli after the Tottenham midfielder was booked for celebrating his goal by cupping his ear to rival fans in the north London derby.

The Belgian put the visitors ahead in the 56th minute when he raced clear and fired a shot past the outstretched hand of Arsenal keeper Wojciech Szczesny.

Sportsmail's Graham Poll gives his verdict on the decision.

Referee Michael Oliver was not amused and brandished a yellow card to a bemused Chadli

Michael Oliver’s booking of Tottenham’s Nacer Chadli after he celebrated his opening goal by cupping his hand behind his ear might have seemed harsh to some.

However, Oliver obviously believed Chadli was trying to wind up Arsenal fans in such a heated local derby.

I once cautioned Frank Lampard for the same thing at Anfield — much to his dismay.

Curiously, Steven Gerrard did the same thing against Everton on Saturday and no action was taken against him.
