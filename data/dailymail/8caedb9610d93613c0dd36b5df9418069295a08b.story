Victor Matfield received a phone call after arriving in London on Sunday which brought home to him how times have changed since he eased out retirement a year ago – in Bermuda, of all places.

The iconic Springbok lock is enjoying a new lease of life in Test rugby, after ending his playing career in 2011, only to subsequently have a change of heart. On Saturday, he will face England in the QBE series at Twickenham, having become South Africa’s most-capped player – which seemed a distant prospect when he was making a guest appearance on the veterans’ circuit.

Twelve months ago, 37-year-old Matfield was having fun in the sun – helping his country win the World Rugby Classic in Bermuda, via victory against the Classic Lions in the final. It was all part of the grand plan to return to the elite level of the game. That was the first, tentative step in the process.

Springbok lock Victor Matfield retired in 2011, only to  have a change of heart

‘I went to Bermuda at the end of last year,’ he told Sportsmail on Monday. ‘By then I actually knew that I was going to play again so I almost felt like I would go there and see if my body was feeling right for it. I had been mountain-biking quite a bit so I had gone down to 99kg and I was skinny!

‘I went over and it was much slower, but it was pretty physical because most of the boys are 10-15kgs heavier than they should be! So the collisions were still really tough and it was just good to get back into it, see how my body felt and it felt alright.

‘What was nice was that I was the only guy there who was really in shape. All the other guys would have stints of about 20 minutes and come off, but I would play every minute of every game. There were a couple of beers after each game – and before each game too!

Matfield will face England in the QBE series at Twickenham on Saturday

South Africa may look to parachute Patrick Lambie in at fly-half to face England at Twickenham on Saturday ahead of fast-rising star Handre Pollard. 

Meanwhile, Springboks attack coordinator and forwards coach Johann van Graan has singled out England’s scrum-half as one of their chief threats: ‘Twickenham is a place we love to play. We’re facing world-class players; we’ve a lot of respect for Danny Care.’

‘We won the tournament, which made it even better. I got a call from the guys at the airport yesterday – the South African boys who were on their way there for this year’s tournament. They were missing me!’

While those former Boks are once again enjoying the laid-back charms of the Bermuda tournament, Matfield finds himself back at the sharp end of his profession – ready for a fifth personal appearance at Twickenham. He had finished playing in 2011 and did some TV punditry, as well as coaching with his provincial team, the Pretoria-based Blue Bulls. He had embraced retirement.

But, behind the scenes, he was being coaxed into a return by his long-term mentor, Heyneke Meyer, the former Bulls and – briefly – Leicester coach, who had taken charge of the South Africa team after the last World Cup.

‘I always thought I would have loved to play under Heyneke in a Springbok team,’ said Matfield. ‘Then I retired in 2011 and when I did, I didn’t know who was going to be the coach. When he got the job, the first call he made was to me, to ask me to come out of retirement. He wanted me to come back in, to captain the side as well.’

At first, he resisted Meyer’s advances, but eventually, Matfield agreed to come out of retirement on the basis that he would play on until next year’s World Cup. There were other former Bulls coaches now working within the Boks’ set-up and the renowned second row thought to himself: ‘These guys can win the World Cup.’

He had misgivings though – fears even. ‘I was very happy retired and my wife was very happy as well, so it was something I had to discuss with her,’ he said. ‘When I retired, that was a big part of it, thinking, “I’ve had my stint, it’s time to get back to my family”, so when Heyneke asked me, the biggest thing I had to be sure was that my family would be alright if I did this for another two years.

‘Physically, fitness-wise, I always knew I would be fine. Lineout-wise, I was also confident because I was still involved with it, coaching the Bulls. I was going up against the guys and I found it pretty easy to win the lineouts against the current players, so I was happy with that.

‘But the physical contact was what I was scared of. Being older and after being out of it for two years – I had gone down to 99kg and I normally played at about 108, so I had to bulk up again. So I was definitely scared.

‘I also didn’t want to just come back, play two or three games and think, “Damn, I’m not going to make it”, not even make the Bok team and then just fade away. So there was a lot of pressure on me and I was a bit worried.’

Veteran Matfield is South Africa’s most-capped player after 117 appearances

Ultimately, Matfield’s concerns proved unfounded. Once he had withstood the ferocity of a heavily scrutinised Bulls comeback against South African rivals the Sharks in Durban early this year, he soon returned to the old routine and discovered that his body coped more effectively than it had done before his career hiatus.

‘I am definitely in much better nick than I was in 2011,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t get up in the mornings and I couldn’t walk down my stairs at home – I had to hold on. I think the two-year break helped my body a lot. Before that, I was just buggered! My body had seized up.’

Once he was up to speed again, a path back into the Springboks team opened up for him as other contenders in his position all succumbed to injury. ‘I was the only one left,’ he joked. His return soon led to him surpassing John Smit as his country’s most-capped player and later in the Rugby Championship he was at the heart of South Africa’s first win over the All Blacks since 2011.

When news of his comeback went public, Matfield sensed a 50-50 split in media opinion at home. By the end of his first season back in the southern hemisphere’ s showpiece Test event, he had quelled any trace of resistance to his return. The sceptics had been silenced.

Matfield insists the 2015 World Cup will be his swansong

Being a Bok again has meant being reunited with his long-term lock accomplice, the arch enforcer – Bakkies Botha. Matfield has savoured the reunion, both of them have; enjoying the notion that they are defying the passing of time.

‘It’s so funny, I knew I was going to come back last year and all of a sudden I saw that Bakkies was back in the squad for the end-of-year tour,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t believe it was real that the two of us were going to play together again. Every time we get on the bus, we sit at the back there and Bakkies says to me, “We’re still here. We’re still here. They can’t get rid of us!”.’

Yet, for Matfield, the end is in sight, for a second and final time. Whatever happens against England on Saturday, on the rest of this tour and over the next 10 months, the 2015 World Cup will be his swansong – no doubt at all. ‘The World Cup will be my last time playing,’ he said. ‘I have already signed a two-year deal with the Bulls for coaching. Everything is in place and this time there definitely won’t be any comeback out of retirement. No chance!’

When that time comes, Matfield will know what to do. Bermuda beckons.
