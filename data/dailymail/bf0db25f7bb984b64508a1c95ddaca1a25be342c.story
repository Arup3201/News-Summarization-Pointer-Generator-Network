Gary Anderson is ready to compete with the big boys again at the World Darts Championship after a traumatic last few years affected his performances on the big stage.

Having reached the final in 2011, the world No 4 hasn’t produced his best at Alexandra Palace in the last three years after losing his brother Stewart to a heart attack in September of that year and seeing his dad pass away six months later.

But Anderson, who plays his first-round match on Saturday night, has enjoyed a good year on the tour and is now hoping to recapture the form that took him to the brink of the world title four years ago.

After a few tough years Gary Anderson is finding his best form at the right time for this year's championships

The Alexandra Palace crowds haven't drawn the best from Anderson since his appearance in the 2011 final

He told Sportsmail: ‘I’ve always said that family come first and it was hard. People were talking about my finishing but I couldn’t give two damns what they thought or said.

‘If anyone in the world says “that’s just the way it goes” then they’re idiots.

‘I’ve only ever played darts for me and when it’s going well I’m enjoying it and I’m happy. For me, darts is just a game that I’ve played since I was 24 and it has turned out to be my job.

‘I’ve had too much on in the past few years, but now everything has settled it has been a good year.’

Anderson changed his darts after his narrow 4-3 defeat by eventual champion Michael van Gerwen in the third round last year in a bid to rediscover his form. He has also welcomed a new addition to the family - his eight-month-old son Tai.

And the lift in his spirits have seen his results improve this year, so much so that he enters the tournament as the No 4 seed when last year he was as low as No 18.

On the birth of his son Tai, Anderson said: ‘It was a huge weight off my shoulders and I’m enjoying things just now which makes my darts a lot easier for me. The last couple of years I wasn’t enjoying my darts, but I have this year.’

Anderson will face either Mike McGrath or Scott Kirchner in the first round at Alexandra Palace, and he admitted that he doesn’t know too much about his potential opponents.

‘It’s always a bad thing because I like to know who I’m playing against,’ the world No 4 said.

‘You can’t keep a tab on every player in the world and in the last few years I have had really tough games in the first round. But that is the way it is now because there are so many good players these days.’
