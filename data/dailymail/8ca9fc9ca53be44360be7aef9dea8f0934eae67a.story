A group of young thieves stole more than $4,000 worth of designer jeans and backpacks from a New York City Urban Outfitters location this week, police have revealed.

Four men, who have been described as in their twenties, visited the trendy retailer’s Financial District store on Friday morning and fled the scene with 17 pieces of merchandise.

DNA Info reports that among their loot was ten pairs of PRPS ‘destroyed’ Rambler jeans that sell for $295 per piece. The denim pants, which are manufactured in Japan, boast bleach splatters, paint drops, and multiple rips around the knee.

Snapped: The NYPD has issued surveillance images of the four alleged thieves, who are being sought for arrest on charges of grand larceny

The denim pants, which are manufactured in Japan, follow the current trend for deconstructed denim with bleach splatters, paint drops, and multiple rips around the knee.

The thieves also reportedly took five pairs of PRPS’s Rambler jeans produced with a lye wash. 

They are also said to have taken two backpacks that are valued at $295 each.

On Saturday police arrested 24-year-old suspect Robert Dupree of Brooklyn, charging him with grand larceny in connection with the case.

Mr Dupree was arrested in front of Urban Outfitter’s Chelsea location on Sixth Avenue.

It is unclear why he was at the Urban Outfitters location. Police say that no further arrests have yet been made in the case.
