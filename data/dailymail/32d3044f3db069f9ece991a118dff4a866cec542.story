It is officially 'Hammer Time' in the Barclays Premier League, just in time for Big Sam to pull on his baggy pants and perform 'U Can’t Touch This' at the Christmas karaoke. Now, that really would mark a full cycle in West Ham’s wheel of fortune.

Twelve months ago, Sam Allardyce was under the cosh. His team were ensconced in the bottom three, his squad was creaking at the seams under a pile-up of injuries and supporters were groaning at the style of football he was delivering.

Things would get worse as Allardyce’s beleaguered team lost 5-0 with a weakened team in the FA Cup at Nottingham Forest and were thrashed by six at Manchester City, three days later.

But the manager dug in, the board declined to sack him, despite many rumours to the contrary, and today West Ham are getting comfy in the Champions League places.

Here, MailOnline Sport discovers exactly what has changed for the Hammers over the past year.

THE PLAYERS

The most obvious change is that the club have better players available. For one, they do not have the injuries they were suffering from last season. Andy Carroll’s return to fitness is a major boost, as there is no-one quite like him in the Premier League.

More importantly, they have bolstered the squad with a distinct upgrade in quality. Alex Song and Carl Jenkinson, both signed on loan, were outstanding in the 3-1 win against Swansea, the third victory on the bounce.

On Sunday, against Swansea, there were only three survivors from the team beaten 4-1 at Liverpool on December 7, 2013.

Kevin Nolan            90        10,8           6.7

Stewart Downing    90         10.6           6.6

Cheikho Kouyate    90        10.2           6.3

Song has stabilised the midfield and added quality on the ball. He seems a better player since returning from Barcelona, more patient in possession, and not so reckless. He linked up well with Jenkinson, marauding forward from right-back. Aaron Cresswell has stepped easily up to the top level and provides balance on the left.

Up front both Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho have settled immediately, something which always involves a little chance. You need a bit of luck along the way. How much Allardyce knew about Valencia and Sakho is debatable – co-owner David Sullivan always loves to gamble on a striker - but they have proved inspired.

Sakho’s goal against Swansea was his eighth in 10 games in all competitions (he's scored seven in the Premier league) and he seems perfect for the English top flight. He works hard and preys on mistakes. He is quick enough so that defenders do not get back with a recovery tackles. And his finishing, thus far, has been clinical.

THE COACHES

Much has been made of Teddy Sheringham’s influence, since he was appointed as a specialist coach to work with the strikers, and it is difficult to argue with the goals. Sahko, Valencia, Carroll, Carlton Cole and Mauro Zarate have all hit the target.

John Hartson on BBC Match of the Day was impressed by the subtleties of Carroll’s movement in the penalty box. Sheringham’s great asset was the way he read the game. If he can get any of that across to the five strikers, he will improve them.

It was also good to see Carroll sprint to celebrate with the coaching team, and the medics who helped him through the dark days of recovery from injuries. Harmony and togetherness will generate the spirit required to pull teams through when they are not playing so well, or when fortune turns against them.

This goes for the relationship between Allardyce and the boardroom, too. At the moment, all is calm. The signings have paid off and the manager’s decisions are proving successful. They are entitled to feel smug.

But there is still an undercurrent at the club that this is not a natural fit, with Allardyce at pains to point out his tactical brilliance at every opportunity while the owners point to the success of their signings and demand for the team to play with greater adventure.

'We recruited a better calibre of player in the summer, who were chosen because they have the ability to play the West Ham way,' wrote David Gold, in his programme notes for the Swansea game.

Before the game, Allardyce was on TV talking about the possibility of a contract extension.

Perhaps a successful season will soothe this friction.

PLAYING STYLE

The style has certainly changed for the better. Allardyce will insist this is because there are more and better players available. He is also entitled to credit for the shape of the team, and the switch to a midfield diamond which has allowed Stewart Downing to thrive.

West Ham appear committed to a core of English players and they are committed to attack, with two strikers and attacking full-backs to provide the width lost to the diamond. 

There were 36 cross delivered against Swansea, which helped Carroll wreak havoc. They have 26 goals, double the total they had after 15 Premier League games last season.

In midfield, besides the controlling influence of Song and Mark Noble (under-rated and overlooked by England despite his ability in the midfield holding role), the energy of Cheikhou Kouyate has been important, although Kevin Nolan covered more ground than anyone.

Without this industry and commitment in midfield, it is difficult to get away with two strikers in the modern game.

At the back there are questions, which will eat away at Allardyce, a manager who likes to be solid. There will be times when the centre-halves are exposed by their ambitious full-backs, and will have to make decisions with no margin for error.

They have conceded only 18, so there is no cause for immediate alarm. Goalkeeper Adrian is not always totally convincing but has done well. The side has good physical presence and is dangerous from set-pieces, as Allardyce teams usually are.

THE CARROLL QUESTION

Carroll adds something rare in the modern game, a genuine aerial threat, which can trigger panic among modern central defenders. Allardyce was right to lament the lost art.

Not only did he score twice against Swansea, but he nodded headers down and created chances and chaos. By the end of the game, centre-halves Kyle Bartley and Ashley Williams looked as if they might concede from every attack.

He will be judged on goals but he also creates space for others. He supplied the flick for Sakho’s goal and the pass for Sakho’s run which tempted Lukasz Fabianski into the challenge which earned him a red card.

Regardless of the debate about his transfer value, if Carroll is fully fit, he is an enormous threat. No centre-half will want to mark him, especially if West Ham can successfully keep 30-plus crosses flying into his airspace. Can he stay fit? That is the key.

THE FANS

Upton Park was deathly quiet at times during the game against Swansea, perhaps it was the nerves which came with the knowledge that a win would propel them to third place for the first time in 15 years.

It made you wonder what the atmosphere might be like at the Olympic Stadium. Maybe this is simply the changing face of football crowds: a bit more corporate and a bit more discerning.

By the end, they were in full voice, cheering the goals and celebrating the win. Presumably they enjoyed the style of football, although from behind the press box, there were desperate shouts to 'get it back in the box' for Carroll to head.

At least for now they are not in open dissent as they were this time last year when the future seemed far less enticing.

THE FUTURE

It looks very bright. Certainly brighter than it did this time last year. But it will depend on how they build on this encouraging first four months of the season. Song and Jenkinson, two stand-out performers, are only on loan.

History tells us that Carroll’s fitness is unreliable, as is Downing’s form. But it is better to build from a position of success. With points on the board, it eases a pressure; the team can play with freedom they don’t have when scrapping against the drop.

A stronger squad should help Allardyce ride the problems he is sure to face at some point.

Qualify for Europe and it will tempt better players and help keep those who might be lured away.

The plan was always to make sure West Ham were in the Premier League at the time when they moved to the new stadium. At this rate, they might be setting sights a little higher.

P.S… THE KIT

Of course, there’s transfers and tactics and spirit, etc. but what if it’s all down to the kit? West Ham’s shirts have a horizontal pinstripe with an 80s feel, similar to the design in 1985/86 when they finished third, only four points behind champions Liverpool.
