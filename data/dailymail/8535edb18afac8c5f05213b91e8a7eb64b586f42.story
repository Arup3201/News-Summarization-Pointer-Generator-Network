Pre smart phones and iPads two-way radio transceivers occupied the top spot of most children's Christmas wish lists.

And now the retro walkie talkie, which was ideal for outdoor activities and a fun and easy way of communicating without a hefty phone bill, has been given a stylish update.

An artist has created what he dubs the 'new' Walkie Talkies by building retro phones into a variety of shoes.

Talkable art: An artist has created what he dubs the new WalkieTalkies by building retro phones into a variety of shoes

Designer Sean
Miles has built the quirky art piece using old
Nokia and LG handsets sent in by O2 Recycle customers who no longer had
a use for them and building them into iconic footwear that includes a Christian Louboutin heel, a 
classic men’s brogue, a Nike Air trainer and a Hunter Welly.

The designs, created with O2 Recycle, aim to highlight what can be done with these old handsets, rather than being sent to landfill.

Fully functional: Each Walkie Talkie performs exactly as a normal phone would, the keypad being incorporated into the sole of each shoe

These Walkie Talkies are upcycled by combining recycled handsets and vintage shoes to create fully functional phones that double as pieces of desirable art. 

Each Walkie Talkie performs exactly as a normal phone would, the keypad being incorporated into the sole of each shoe.

The mobile phone upcycling project has been created by O2 Recycle, which pays up to £260 to those who recycle their gadgets.

Designer, Sean Miles said: 'I wondered how I could make phones that people might be embarrassed to be seen with into something that would give them a new lease of life – which is what upcycling is all about.

Recycle: The stylish new initiative aims to stop people binning their old phones

'I hoped that, by turning them into Walkie Talkies, I would raise a smile and perhaps a laugh and create things that people wanted once again.

'I’ve been using them while out with friends and they never fail to start a conversation, even when I’m not using them as a phone!

'I hope that they can get more people talking about the need to recycle old gadgets rather than binning them.'

And Sean isn't stopping at just shoes.

Next on his agenda is handbags (so
women don’t lose their phones in their bags, the bags will be phones) 
and gloves that have a phone integrated into them.

Bill
Eyres, head of O2 Recycle said: 'While we may not be able to upcycle 
every phone that we receive, I hope that this project will prompt a few 
more of the 30 million people a year who buy a new handset to recycle 
their old one.

'You may
not end up with a Walkie Talkie of your own, but at the very least you 
will get some cash in your pocket as we offer a cash sum to all those 
who recycle gadgets with us.

'There’s
a huge environmental need to dig out old gadgets so they can be used 
again, rather than lying unused and unloved in the drawer.

'Whether
functioning phones are sent on so that others can make use of them or 
they are stripped for their metals which can be used again, we’ve all 
got a role to play in making sure that phones live on even when we’ve 
finished with them.'
