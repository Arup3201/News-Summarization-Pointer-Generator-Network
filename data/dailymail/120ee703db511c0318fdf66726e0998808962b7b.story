The body of a baby found dumped at the side of a country road was that of a girl, police confirmed today.

Officers were called to Ox Hey Lane in Lostock, Bolton, shortly before 4.55pm on Thursday after the body was discovered by a man and woman out walking their dog.

The body was wrapped in clothing and plastic bags, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said.

Investigation: Police forensic officers search the undergrowth on Ox Hey Lane in Bolton after the body of a newborn baby was discovered found dead and abandoned

Worrying: A cordon has been set up around a path where the child was found, close to fields used by Bolton Wanderers' academy players

Officers also recovered a note which requested that the baby receive an Islamic burial.

A post mortem examination has been carried out and the cause of death remains unascertained.

The age and ethnicity of the baby are still unknown and it remains unclear whether the baby was live or stillborn, police said.

Further tests will now be carried out.

Chief Inspector Carol Martin, said: 'We can now confirm the baby was a little girl but there are still a number of questions that remain unanswered.

Death: The scene is close to this football academy

Discovery: Forensic officers set up tents to search for evidence

'Chief among these questions is the 
identity of the mother. Our priority remains to trace the mother who we 
imagine must be having an extremely distressing time.

'We are still very worried about the parentsâ€™ physical and emotional state.'

It is likely the mother in 
particular will require some form of medical attention and I want to 
appeal directly to both parents or anyone who knows them to contact 
police or visit your GP or local hospital.'

Ms Martin added: 'It is vitally 
important that I stress support networks are in place and are waiting 
and on hand to help the parents.

Grim: The dead body of a newborn baby was found abandoned near to a Bolton Wanderers training ground. The location is also a mile away from the team's Reebok Stadium, pictured

'People will notice an increased 
police presence in the area this Thursday as it will be a week on from 
this sad discovery. If you have any questions or concerns then please 
approach the officers - they are there to help.'

Police have appealed to residents in 
the Lostock area who perhaps use Ox Hey Lane for running, cycling or 
walking on a frequent or daily basis for information.

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 0161 856 5599 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111
