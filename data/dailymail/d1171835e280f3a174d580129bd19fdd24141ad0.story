The first tussle of this year's Ryder Cup appears to have been won by the United States after Europe captain Paul McGinley lost the early fashion battle with an ill-advised tartan jacket and gilet.

The Ryder Cup has a long history of awful clothing, and while McGinley's combo will not trouble the the US shirts at Brookline in 1999 for top spot in the hall of shame, it is nevertheless not a promising start to the sartorial week in Scotland.

But McGinley, who was waiting to greet the American team at Edinburgh airport, soon saw the opposition also score an own goal as Rickie Fowler unveiled a new haircut featuring 'USA' shaved into the right side.

McGinley's tartan jacket may not be spotted at a Topman near you any time soon, but it is still a welcome tribute to the hosts of this year's Ryder Cup, which is being held at Gleneagles in Scotland and tees off proper with Friday's foursomes and fourballs.

While American fans heading into the office this week are advised not to copy Fowler's brash barnet, the 25-year-old Californian's patriotic passion for the competition also comes shining through.

In perhaps the biggest shock of all on Monday, it was Ian Poulter who was spotted wearing the most sensible dress. The flamboyant Englishman, who has sported Union Jack slacks and tartan trousers among many bold designs, was spotted hitting balls on the range in a plain grey jumper.

Ian Poulter, surprisingly, was the most demurely dressed star on show, wearing grey at Gleneagles

The European team kit - designed by Glenmuir - for the competition proper is a closely-guarded secret and the attire will only become known on the morning of each day's play. The US kit has been designed by Ralph Lauren, and has divided opinion so far.

But whatever they're wearing, it's going to be a great week. So long as they avoid the depths of Brookline, that is.
