Jordan Rhodes is poised to ask for a transfer to help push through a £12million move to Hull City.

The Scotland international senses this could be his best chance of stepping up to the Premier League and the stability Steve Bruce has brought to the Humberside club reassures him it is the right move.

Blackburn Rovers manager Gary Bowyer has held talks with owners Venky's after they rejected two Hull bids with £10million plus Alex Bruce the last offer.

Bruce is keen to sign a striker after Shane Long moved to Southampton for £12m earlier this month.
