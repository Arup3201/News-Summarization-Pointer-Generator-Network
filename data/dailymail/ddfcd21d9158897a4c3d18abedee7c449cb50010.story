A 32-year-old New York City elementary school teacher who used a gay slur during a drunken pool party row, on a reality show, could be about to lose her job.

Sara Schapiro, who teaches first grade at Public School 63 in the East Village, appeared on the Bravo show Princesses: Long Island, and called another castmate a 'f-----' as she fought with him and his girlfriend.

Now school officials are deciding whether she should be allowed to remain in the classroom after the summer recess.

The F-Word: Sara Shapiro, 32, a teacher in New York's East Village may well be watching what comes out of her mouth after having a brush with education officials over her foul language

Not fit for the classroom: Education officials are deciding whether to allow Sara Shapiro to return to her $66,000-a-year teaching job in September. She says that she may quit anyway

If she is barred from returning to school, she would be the second teacher to lose her job after appearing on the show.

Last
month, a Long Island middle school teacher was asked to resign after he
was seen taking off his shirt and splashing in the pool with 
bikini-clad women. He barely spoke during the scenes that were aired.

Stefan
Serie, 30, says he had to resign from Merrick Avenue Middle School 
after the show aired despite lingering mainly in the background at the 
pool party.

Parents and students have urged the school to reinstate him.

Row: Sara's comments kicked of a huge row which spilled over from the reality show into her career

Insistent: Moments after making the comment, Sara attempted to apologize for her words, but it seems as thought the damage may have already have been done

'It’s unfortunate that this show has had a negative impact on so many lives,' he said through his lawyer, Joseph Kilada.

Miss Schapiro's foul-mouthed outburst occurred during the same episode.

The Department of Education is now investigating Miss Schapiro's case.

'We’re all drinking and having fun in our bathing suits,' Schapiro, a 32-year-old Long Island native, told The Daily News. 'I didn’t think about being a teacher at the time. I’m probably going to end up resigning.'

She has provided some excuses for her vulgarity telling the Daily News that the slur was part of a 'character' she was playing and that she may now quit teaching regardless.

Record: The teacher has also been arrested for driving while intoxicated, drug possession and reckless driving

In character? Sara says he drunken-fueled words were simply part of a character she was playing and not the 'real' her

Princesses: The show follows the exploits of several 20-something Jewish ladies who live with their parents on Long Island and spend their time searching desperately for love and money

“I'm not proud of that by any means,' she said. 'I had to make a decision: I could have walked away but I went with option B and embraced the character.'

Miss Schapiro's on-screen argument centered around another woman's boyfriend. When he tried to tell her to 'take a stroll,' she let loose with the slur.

The teacher of seven years, who earns $66,000, has also been arrested for driving while intoxicated, drug possession and reckless driving in Florida in 2002.

Ever belligerent, she says she wouldn't change anything about her appearance on the show.

'Nope! I was on TV. I don't care. I had a good time,' she said.
