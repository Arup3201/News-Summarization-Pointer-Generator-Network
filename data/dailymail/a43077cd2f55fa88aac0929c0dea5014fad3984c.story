A 25-year-old southwestern Illinois man was charged Saturday with aggravated criminal sexual abuse in connection with a St. Louis teenager who said she was held captive in his home for three years.

St. Clair County State's Attorney Brendan Kelly said Saturday that Steven Elliot Johnson had sex with the then-underage teenager.

Johnson's mother, 54-year-old Owida Johnson, was charged with two misdemeanor counts of child endangerment.

Both are in St. Clair County Jail. 
Steven Johnson was being held on $2 million bond, his mother on $15,000 
bond. No court date has been set and Kelly said no attorneys have been 
appointed.

Speaking to The Associated Press, 
Kelly wouldn't comment on whether the charges back up the story the 
19-year-old woman told police about being held against her will and 
conceiving a son during the first year she allegedly was at the 
Washington Park home.

The now-2-year-old boy was taken from the home by a police SWAT team Thursday.

Kelly said that there were unsafe and
unsanitary conditions in the home, including exposed wiring, spoiled 
food in the refrigerator, animal feces in the house and insect and 
vermin activity.

He said the two counts of child endangerment involve two children, but would not say to whom the other child belonged.

Police say the teenager told them she
met the suspect through someone else and that she visited his home 
around the time she was reported missing. The man later wouldn't allow 
her to go back home to her parents, according to police.

According to the teen, the suspect's 
mother helped detain her and helped falsify medical records, police say.
The teen told investigators the man and his mother coerced her into 
using a false name when giving birth to conceal that she was underage, 
according to police.

The young woman has told police she 
repeatedly tried to escape the house, which is on Washington Park's 
busiest street and next door to a convenience store, just a half mile 
from a freeway. But her captor chased her down each time and forced her 
back to the home at gunpoint, according to police.

Steven Johnson faces a separate 
felony charge of promotion of prostitution. Kelly would not say if that 
was related to the teenager.

Johnson also faces two felony drug 
charges and a felony gun charge. Combined, his charges would bring a 
maximum sentence of 30 years.

Kelly would not comment on the possibility of other charges, saying only that the investigation is ongoing.

Washington Park is a village of 4,200
people tucked on the edge of East St. Louis in one of Illinois' poorest
regions. Known for its strip clubs and poverty, the community has 
grappled for years with corruption and violent crime punctuated by the 
2010 shooting death of the village's mayor, John Thornton.

The village twice has filed for bankruptcy since 2004, the last time in 2009.

The teenager held 
as a captive sex slave in a house for more than three years before 
escaping with a relative's help initially went there voluntarily but 
wasn't allowed to leave when she wanted to go home, an Illinois police 
chief said on Friday.

Horrific abuse: The teenager told police she escaped her daily torment earlier this week with a relative's help

Washington
Park Police Chief David Clark said the 19-year-old St. Louis woman 
bolted from the home on Monday and told investigators her time in 
captivity included almost daily beatings and sexual assaults.

One
of those attacks resulted in a now-2-year-old boy rescued when a police
SWAT team raided the home next to a gas station on Thursday and 
arrested a 25-year-old man and his mother, Clark said.

According to Washington Park police, the woman claims she was held 
against her will for more than 2 years as a sex slave at the house on 
Kingshighway by the 25-year-old man and his family.Â 

A boy, aged 16, was also removed from the home in his school uniform, according to BND.com.

The police chief said the three days between the teen's report and the raid on the home was largely spent substantiating her story. Clark also said investigators were working a separate sexual-assault case and lacked the manpower to go any faster.

No charges have been filed in the case. Clark wouldn't publicly identify the suspect - originally reported as 17-years old - his mother or the teenager, citing the ongoing investigation.

He said investigators planned to have the child's DNA tested to determine whether the man is his father.

St. Clair County State's Attorney Brendan Kelly, the county's top prosecutor, told The Associated Press on Friday that conditions in the home were 'definitely deplorable.'

Initial evidence suggests that 'some of the details are consistent with what the young lady is saying, and I think there's something to it.' he said. 'We're still trying to figure out what the heck is going on.'

Clark said the teenager met the man socially 'through someone else when they were partying, and a relationship built,' eventually leading to her visit of his home about the time she was reported missing.

'When she (soon) decided to go back to her parents, he wouldn't allow it,' Clark said.

She was listed as a missing
or runaway juvenile on April 6, 2010 in St Louis, Missouri, close to 
the state line. She was 15 years old when she disappeared.

He said the man's mother helped detain the young woman and helped falsify medical records when she bore her son in the first year of her captivity. The teen told investigators the man and his mother coerced her into using a false name when giving birth to conceal that she was under-aged, Clark said.

The young woman has told police she repeatedly tried to escape the house, which is on Washington Park's busiest street and next door to a convenience store, just a half mile from a freeway. But her captor chased her down each time and forced her back to the home at gunpoint, Clark said.

Washington Park is a village of 4,200 people tucked on the edge of East St. Louis in one of Illinois' poorest regions. Known for its strip clubs and poverty, the community has grappled for years with corruption and violent crime punctuated by the 2010 shooting death of the village's mayor, John Thornton.

The village twice has filed for bankruptcy since 2004, the last time in 2009.

Neighbors told The Associated Press they had little reason to suspect anything amiss at the bungalow on a parcel cluttered with trash, including a stack of six mildewing mattresses on a concrete slab surrounded by tall weeds. A child's car seat, baby stroller and car tires were nearby.

A neighbor, Lakeitha Smith, opened her front door a crack and told the AP that during the few times she saw the young woman outside, the teenager didn't appear bruised or traumatized.

Smith said the man would step away from the home at times with the toddler, who 'looked like a healthy baby,' and often came to Smith's house, where he played with her 3-year-old son.

Rescue: A baby was taken from the home in Washington Park, Illinois where his mother had been held captive

Disappearance: The 19-year-old has been described as missing or a runaway by police since 2010

'They was like normal people,' Smith said. 'I really didn't know what was going on over there. I never knew it was something like that.'

'I used to see her come out of the house, back and forth,' Smith said. 'I didn't think she was being held hostage in the house.'

The teenager and the toddler taken from the home were later turned over to the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services.

Her ordeal has been compared 
to international bestselling novel Room by Emma Donoghue which tells a similar story of a woman who was abducted and held captive by a man who fathers a
child with her. She is forced to live in a single room with her 
five-year-old son until they escape.

House of horrors: The girl was held against her will as this home in Washington Park, Illinois and repeatedly sexually attacked and beaten

Room by Irish-Canadian author Emma Donoghue

The book tells the story of a woman, referred to as Ma, who was abducted from college aged 19 by a man called Old Nick.

She gives birth to two children while
in captivity - a girl who dies at birth and also a boy, Jack. Ma and Jack live in a single room.

Jack 
escapes and leads police to the house to free Ma and Old
Nick is sent to jail.

The case makes news headlines and the media attention causes Ma to have a nervous breakdown.

Donoghue says she was inspired by 
the story of Elisabeth Fritzl, a 42-year-old woman who was held captive 
for 24 years in a basement in Austria while her father raped her 
resulting in seven children and one miscarriage.

The novel has sold more than one million copies and has won several awards.
