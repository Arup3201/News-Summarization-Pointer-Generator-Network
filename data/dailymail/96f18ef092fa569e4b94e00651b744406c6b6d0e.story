Jimmy Greaves, the greatest goalscorer ever to pull on the white shirts of Spurs and England, celebrates his 75th birthday on Friday.

In 1961, his £99,999 transfer from AC Milan was a record. Goodness knows what he’d have been worth in today’s crazy money climate.

Sadly, his relations with Tottenham have never been the same since he was sold to West Ham in 1970 as part of the deal which brought Martin Peters to White Hart Lane.

On Sunday, Spurs entertain West Ham. There couldn’t be a better time for the current board to invite Greavsie to the game as their guest of honour.

Modern football is always quick to stage sentimental shows of sympathy for players who have died. Surely it’s much more important to honour those who are still with us.

And even if he’s not there, the club should ask the crowd for a minute’s deafening applause to wish Jimmy a very happy 75th birthday.
