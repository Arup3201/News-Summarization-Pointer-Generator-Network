Amir Khan has no interest in a domestic dust-up with Kell Brook as he looks to land a fight with pound-for-pound superstars Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao next year.

Brook, who earlier this year captured the IBF welterweight title before being forced to take time away from the ring when he was stabbed while in Tenerife, has long courted a showdown with the Bolton fighter.

But Khan believes he is a level above Brook and would prefer to be matched against the two biggest fighters in the sport.

Kell Brook has long courted a fight with Khan but the Bolton boxer says he is 'not interested'

'I'm not really interested in the Kell Brook fight,' Khan said.

'I'm looking at the biggest names in boxing. Floyd Mayweather, Manny Pacquiao, I think that's where I belong.

'If the fight doesn't happen with Floyd then maybe Manny Pacquiao is another option. I'd like to fight in May to keep myself busy and sharp. I think that helps me.'

Khan produced arguably the finest performance of his career on Saturday night in a lopsided points win over former two-weight world champion Devon Alexander.

It was just Khan's second fight in the 147lb division, although many believe his style would cause all sorts of problems for the unbeaten Mayweather.

However, the WBC and WBA champion is targeting a super fight with WBO titlist Manny Pacquiao and dismissed Khan earlier this week, saying of the 28-year-old: 'No one knows who Amir Khan is.'

Khan, though, has not given up hope, saying: 'I want the fight, but is Floyd going to take the fight? Is Floyd going to give me that chance? That's something we're all waiting to hear from Floyd Mayweather.

Manny Pacquiao is the other boxer who Khan wants a superfight with 

'I've been asking for the fight for the last two or three years. Now he needs to come back to the press and say, 'I want the fight with Amir Khan'.

'I know I'm touching distance away from that super fight. I think I've proven myself many times and I think this time I've proved myself in the biggest way so he has to take the fight. What else do I have to do?

'I know if I can bring Floyd Mayweather to Britain then I'll sell out Wembley Stadium. How big does he need my name to be?

Khan arrived back in Manchester along with his wife and daughter on Wednesday

'I think these are little excuses. I'm sure people realise that. It seems to me he doesn't want to fight me. I have the speed, dexterity, accuracy, movement, power; I think it's something that he doesn't really want to mix with.'

Khan, meanwhile, is to donate the shorts he wore in beating Alexander to raise money for the school in Pakistan where 132 schoolchildren were shot dead by the Taliban on Tuesday.

The shorts have 24 carat gold thread woven through the waistband and cost around £30,000.

Khan, who is of Pakistani heritage, said: 'I'm going to be donating them towards what happened in Pakistan. I want to rebuild the school and strengthen the security over there.'

Khan has announced that he will donate the £30,000 shorts he wore during his last week to charity

The trunks, made specially for the fight, have genuine 24 carat gold thread woven into the waistband 

The 28-year-old's shorts are worth £30,000 and were on show during the fight with the American
