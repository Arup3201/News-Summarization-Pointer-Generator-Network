The pillar of rock known as ‘God’s Finger’ points to the sky above Brazil’s training base in the hills above Rio de Janeiro as if demanding a moment of respectful silence.

Drumroll. Luiz Felipe Scolari will now attempt the same trick — holding together a nation using only the power of football — without the aid of a safety net. The knock-out stage adds even more drama to the World Cup.

Scolari’s players completed the final session before leaving their stylish mountain retreat with a flourish of the crispest penalty kicks, to the delight of fans who must have been concerned by the awful display of finishing from open play which had gone before.

Top boss: Scolari has transformed Brazil but Chile pose the toughest test he has faced so far

Pressure? What pressure? Scolari laughed off journalists' questions on Friday ahead of the game

Brazil have a fine tradition in penalty shoot-outs and they boast a formidable record against opponents Chile, unbeaten in 12 games since 2000. Yet doubt is rife ahead of the last-16 tie.

‘Our numbers are good against Chile, very good, but I’ve seen all their group games and this is one of the best Chile teams for a long time,’ said Gilberto Silva, the former Arsenal midfielder, who won the World Cup with Brazil in 2002.

Gilberto’s caution reflects not only his playing style but also the public mood. It is positive and supportive — protests are not aimed at the team but at FIFA and the authorities who sank millions into football in a country devoid of many basic social facilities.

Scolari’s squad left Teresopolis in a cavalcade of emergency service vehicles, including two fire engines with lights flashing in the twilight, and townsfolk lined the streets to wave them off. Arriving in Belo Horizonte, mothers held up children to the team bus windows and stars such as Thiago Silva responded with a smile of appreciation.

And still there is an undercurrent of mild dread about what might happen if it goes wrong, as it did 64 years ago, when Brazil lost the final to Uruguay in the Maracana.

‘We want to avoid the ghost of 1950,’ said Gilberto. ‘I grew up  listening to those stories.’ Scolari didn’t help when he said he would rather have avoided Chile.

Chile, slick and clinical, have  accounted for Spain and Brazil’s centre forward Fred found himself fielding questions this week about his team’s height advantage.

Aerial bombardment is not normally the Brazilian way. Fred nodded politely and said: ‘The high ball could be a good option for us. They’re not tall, but they use their bodies a lot and have good pace.’

There are times Brazil demands a certain type of football. This is not one of them. This time it is not about step-overs and ball-juggling in the airport with Denilson and Ronaldo. This is about winning.

Scolari is trusted to deliver. Despite his Chelsea flop, Big Phil gets along with the World Cup. He made the last four with Portugal and won it with Brazil — taking control in the midst of a stumbling qualifying campaign and injecting a sense of destiny.

‘We had to build slowly,’ said Gilberto. ‘Not many believed we would win it. The first game against Turkey was very hard but we won and grew in confidence.

‘When we reached the next stage and won our first game, we knew we could go all the way. When we reached the final, we saw it in each other’s eyes. Ronaldo wanted to end the frustration from ’98, but every player was important.’

Parallels are being drawn here. Paulinho is expected to be replaced by Fernandinho today just as, 12 years ago, Scolari adjusted his midfield by dropping Middlesbrough’s Juninho after four games and bringing in Kleberson for the final three.

‘As a manager, he does not lose control of what he wants,’ said  Gilberto. ‘This is what makes him special to his players. He puts everyone in the right mind.’

When Scolari returned in November 2012, the brief was clear. Win the World Cup and cleanse the horrors of the Maracanazo. He started by losing 2-1 to England at Wembley in February 2013. There was room for improvement.

England, since then, have not beaten a team which qualified for this tournament. Brazil, in contrast, have won 17 of the last 19 games, winning the Confederations Cup on the way.

Perhaps more crucially, Scolari devised a platform for Neymar to perform freely. ‘He is the main player, a special guy,’ said Gilberto. ‘It is also important other players start to believe. I would like to see Oscar score more goals and Fred.’

There were encouraging signs in the win against Cameroon but from here there is no margin for error for Big Phil and his high-wire act.
