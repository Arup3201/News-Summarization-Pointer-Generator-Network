A 29-year-old Moroccan man was arrested on Friday in an FBI sting operation near the U.S. Capitol while planning to detonate what police said he thought were live explosives.

Amine El Khalifi of Alexandria, Virginia, was taken into custody a year after the FBI received a tip from an informant fearful of his anti-U.S. attitude. Authorities immediately began tracking the suspect.

He was eventually arrested with a fake gun and explosives given to him by undercover FBI agents he believed were al-Qaeda members.

Alexandria, Virginia (artist rendering, right), tried to blow up the U.S. Capitol with what he 
thought were live explosives

Authorities said the suspect was closely
 monitored by law enforcement, and the would-be explosives had been 
deactivated, so the public was never in danger.

Officials say he has recently arrived at a federal court in Alexandria, where he is scheduled to appear later this evening.

Two people briefed on the matter told The Associated Press he was not arrested on the Capitol grounds, and the FBI has had El Khalifi under surveillance around the clock for several weeks.

A U.S. law enforcement official said the El Khalifi was canvassing the U.S. Capitol with violent intentions, Fox News first reported.

He was not believed to have any known 
connections to al-Qaeda, the AP reported, though NBC News said that the 
man had overstayed his visa and was in the country illegally.

Police are currently canvassing El Khalifi's hometown of Alexandria as the investigation continues. Officials say they believe he was acting alone.

They say he was targeting the Capitol Hill Visitor Centre, though he changed his mind about the intended target a few times.

'He wanted to set off the explosives where people would be around,' an official said to NBC News.

El Khalifi expressed interest in 
killing at least 30 people and considered targeting a building in 
Alexandria and a restaurant, synagogue and a place where military 
personnel gather in Washington.

He finally settled on the Capitol after 
canvassing that area a couple of times, a counterterrorism official told
 the AP.

Fox News said that he had come into the country with a family member and then popped up on the FBIâ€™s radar.

The investigation that led to El 
Khalifi's arrest started last January on a confidential informant's tip 
to the FBI, the Associated Press reported.

The informant described a meeting 
inside an Arlington apartment, where a person who produced an AK-47, two
 revolvers and ammunition said the war on terror equated with a 'war on 
Muslims' and urged the group to prepare for battle. El Khalifi, the FBI 
learned, expressed agreement.

Agents said he got more extreme as time passed, and allegedly had ambitions to become the first suicide bomber on U.S. soil.

Federal agents posing as al-Qaeda 
operatives provided him with what he thought was a suicide vest this 
morning, though the explosives were deactivated.

He was taken down by federal agents outside of the FBI's Wasington Field Office Joint Terrorism Task Force, CBS News said.

The news network said that El Khalifi
 was praying at a mosque somewhere in Washington area Friday morning, 
before the alleged mission.

An official told the Post that he was arrested only a few blocks from the Capitol in an alley.

The suspect will appear in federal court as early as this afternoon.

At least 20 people have been arrested
 by federal agents on terrorism-related charges in the past year, the 
Senate Intelligence Committee told the Post.

The plot used by FBI agents is 
similar to those used in the past. Last September, a man was indicted by
 a federal grand jury for allegedly plotting to use remote-controlled 
airplanes filled with explosives to attack the Capitol.

Likewise, back in November 2010, a Somali-born teenager allegedly plotted to bomb a crowded Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon. He was receiving help from what he thought were jihadists, but were in fact federal agents.

The foiled plot comes only a day after the so-called underwear bomber, Nigerian-born Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for his failed Christmas Day attack.

Abdulmutallab tried to blow up a plane by detonating a bomb, but the explosion only caused a brief fire that badly burned his groin.
