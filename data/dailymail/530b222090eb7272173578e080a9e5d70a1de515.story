A Russian woman indundated with vicious and homophobic messages for running a support group for LGBT teenagers, has publicly shamed her trolls by posting their identities online.

Elena Klimova, 26, who runs Children 404 - an online support group for  young people about coming out and dealing with discrimination - regularly receives obscene hate-filled rants from strangers telling her she's 'disgusting' and should kill herself.

The activist fought back by publishing the messages on VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, under the title: 'Beautiful People And The Things They Say To Me'.

Elena Klimova managed to track down the social media accounts of many of her trolls, and has posted their vile messages along with candid photos of each sender (pictured) to a Russian website called VKontakte

Comments include one from a man who told her: You f****** animal, delete your f****** LGBT group.'

A woman named Yulia sent Elena a particularly vitriolic message.

'Hello, Lena. My f*g brother... is one of your friends online, so I have a request for you, teach him not to show his f***** tendencies when he comes to family gatherings.

'He will never be accepted by anyone in our family as a f**, so he can sit and shut up.' 

Elena posted this message along with a photo of Yulia grinning and posing with a bunch of wild flowers.

While Elena has revealed the faces of the people her trolls, MailOnline has blurred them.

'You f*****g animal, delete your f*****g LGBT group,' one man wrote to Elena, which she rather poignantly posted with a photo of said man holding an outstretched cat (pictured)

'As beautiful people write to me often, this album will be continually updated,' Klimova wrote on her VKontakte page, according to Buzzfeed.

'It was created for the enjoyment of contrasts and the diversity of life.'

The name of Elena's group, Children 404, is a reference to the 'page not found' online error notice and Russia’s law banning 'gay propaganda' among minors. 

One of the website's slogans is 'LGBT Teens: We Exist.' 

Another message, this time from a man named Dmitry, referred to homosexuals as 'libidinous f****** perverts'.

In Dmitry's photo, he is seen with his arm affectionately around the shoulders of a female companion. 

This woman (pictured) wrote, 'Hello, Lena. My f*g brother... is one of your friends online. He will never be accepted by anyone in our family as a f*g, so he can sit and shut up'

Elena dubbed the album, 'Beautiful People And The Things They Say To Me'

Another troll wrote: 'You think you’re helping anything with this holy crusade?? Go and f****** kill yourself before they come for you!!! People like you should be locked up!' 

Several people called Elena 'disgusting' and said she would 'burn in hell' for supporting the rights of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community.

Although homosexual relationships in Russia were decriminalised in 1993, discrimination still runs rampant.

In June 2013, Russian lawmakers in Moscow passed a new law banning the 'propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships' to minors.

As a result, Elena has been locked in a legal battle with authorities for two years.

A court has blocked her VKontakte page. Lena also uploaded some of the photos and messages to Facebook earlier this week, which were deleted.

According to the social media network's code, it prohibits 'degrading or shaming another private individual'.
