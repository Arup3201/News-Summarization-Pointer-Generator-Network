Busted: Kathlyn Ruff was arrested after 36 years on the run

The fugitive sister-in-law of former NBA star Jalen Rose has been arrested on murder charges after eluding police for 36 years.

Kathlyn Regina Huff, 58, of Farmington Hills, Michigan, was arrested Tuesday in her driveway, forcing her to finally face charges from a 1977 incident when she allegedly tried to kill her common-law husband by shooting him in the head in Detroit.

The woman fled from Texas to Seattle to Michigan before finally being caught, US Marshals told ABC News. She was taken into custody without incident.

Ms Huff fled San Antonio just before her 1977 indictment for attempted murder and was able to elude authorities because she changed her name to Kathlyn Rose after a second marriage.

US Marshals tracked her across the country until her arrest this week.

‘The Lone Star Fugitive Task Force out of Texas requested that we apprehend her,’ a Marshals spokesperson told ABC. ‘They developed information that she was in the Farmington Hills area.’

The cold case turned hot after the agency began to take another look at old cases, it was the oldest taken on so far, the spokesperson explained.

‘When you tack on the number of years that this person has been on the run, that of course adds more to it,’ the spokesperson added.

Officials from the Detroit Fugitive Apprehension Team, which includes U.S. Marshals, local, state and other federal authorities placed Ms Huff under arrest as she arrived at home.

They simply identified themselves and quietly took her into custody.

A neighbor who spoke to ABC was surprised.

‘It's a shocker because if it's been that long, if she's been around that long, I'm quite surprised,’ said Patricia Kaye. 'It's a very quiet neighborhood. We don't have any odd happenings that go on around here.’

There are no plans to bring criminal charges against any of the woman’s family, she is currently sitting in Oakland County Jail awaiting extradition to Texas.
