He's the forgotten forefather of the World's most popular cartoon character but finally Oswald the Lucky Rabbit is set to be a star in his own right.

Fortune is finally favouring Mickey Mouse's predecessor with Disney thrusting him back into the spotlight after a career break lasting eight decades.

The rabbit with a whacky personality is featuring in a new video game alongside Mickey and Disney has released this sketch by the company's founder Walt for a new exhibition about the groundbreaking animator.

Morphing mouse: This drawing of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, the predecessor
to Mickey Mouse, has just been released by Disney. The sketch is from 
the 1928 film 'Sky Scrappers', the 22nd Oswald short cartoon to be 
produced

The image, drawn on paper in graphite, comes from the 1928 animated short film 'Sky Scrappers.'

It shows Oswald shielding himself from falling bricks with an umbrella.

Warren Spector, the creative director at Junction Point Studios in Austin, Texas, said he's aiming to include the image of Oswald somewhere within video game sequel.

'It's amazing,' said Spector. 'Everybody at Disney is so proud that he's back. I'm no different.

'It's just so exciting to be a part of bringing that character back into the world and to see people respond so affectionately toward him.

'Now, to have Mickey and Oswald brothers united to save the World, it's unbelievable. I feel really privileged.'

Oswald's first appearance since his return came in 2010's "Epic Mickey" 
as the ruler of a forgotten realm.

Archive director Becky Cline 
said: 'We've always known about the character and loved him and wished 
that we could do things with him, but he wasn't a character that 
belonged to us.

'In 2006, we were over the moon when Bob Iger made (the deal).'

Changing faces: Mickey Mouse has evolved a lot over the years, from his humble black and white beginnings he has become a colourful character adored by children around the World

Cline
noted that most of the drawings from Disney's early Oswald cartoons 
were destroyed, thought to be due to a lack of storage when his studio 
moved to a new facility in Burbank, California, in 1939.

Ms Cline 
said the image of Oswald comes from a box of drawings that was found in 
the 1970s and has been preserved in the Disney archives for the past 40 
years.

In the spring of 1928, with a series of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit proving very popular, Walt Disney asked Charles Mintz for an increase in his budget.

Mintz, however, instead demanded that Walt take a 20 percent cut.

As leverage, he reminded Disney that Universal owned the character, and revealed that he had already signed most of Disney's current employees to his new contract.

Angrily, Disney refused the deal and returned to produce the final Oswald cartoons that he was contractually obliged to fulfil for Mintz.

Disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff, but determined to restart from scratch and Oswald was no more.

One lesson Disney learned from the experience was to thereafter always make sure that he owned all rights to the characters produced by his company.

Walt Disney got the inspiration for Mickey Mouse from his old pet mouse which he used to have on his farm.

In 1925, Hugh Harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph taken by Walt Disney.

These inspired animator Ub Iwerks to create a new mouse character for Disney.

'Mortimer Mouse' had been Disney's original name for the character before his wife, Lillian, convinced him to change it, and ultimately Mickey Mouse came to be.

Archivists at Disney dusted off the rough 1928 drawing of Oswald for a new exhibition showcased this month where they unveiled their new video game entitled 'Disney Epic 2: The Power of Two.'

The upcoming adventure game for the Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 allows players to control both Mickey and Oswald.

The rabbit hopped back to Disney in 2006 when CEO Bob Iger 
brokered a deal that sent sportscaster Al Michaels to Universal-NBC.
