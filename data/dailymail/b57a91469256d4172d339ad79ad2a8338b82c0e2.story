A wealthy restaurateur plead not guilty yesterday to four counts of attempted murder after police said he tried to cause his pregnant girlfriend to miscarry their child by poisoning her with a substance known to induce abortion.

Joshua Woodward, 40, who at one time was a prominent restaurateur with eateries in New York City and Los Angeles, was held on $4million dollar bail following his plea.

Prosecutors say he used misoprostol, a drug known to induce labor or cause early-stage abortions, to terminate his girlfriend's pregnancy in the fall of 2009.

Accused: Joshua Woodward, 40, who at one time was a prominent restaurateur, was held on $4million dollar bail following his not guilty plea. He is pictured with Paris and Nicky Hilton, who have no connection to the case, at the opening of Table 8 VIP Opening Party in Los Angeles in 2007

Woodward, who once co-owned Manhattan's exclusive Table 8 restaurant and the 8oz. Burger Bar restaurants in Miami and Los Angeles, turned himself in on Wednesday, nearly three years after the allegations first surfaced.

Woodward's then girlfriend contacted the LAPD after she discovered a mysterious white powder in her underwear in the fall of 2009 after a liaison with Woodward. She then described the circumstances of their relationship.

She said that from the beginning she planned to keep the child but Woodward was adamant about terminating the pregnancy.

According to the affidavit obtained by the New York Daily News, the pregnancy caused a 'bitter' breakup of the pair.

However, Woodward eventually told the unidentified woman, now 42, that he wanted to be involved and the pair reunited.

His then girlfriend told police and prosecutors after they rekindled their relationship, Woodward would often dip his hand into his backpack or pocket before touching her intimately.

A few hours after an encounter on October 18, 2009, she suffered severe cramping and miscarried.

She later noticed a suspicious white powder substance on her underwear and contacted police. They identified the substance as misoprostol.

Misoprostol was initially FDA approved for the prevention and treatment of ulcers, but can also be used to induce labor or miscarriages of early-term pregnancies.

Police told her to hide the fact that she had lost the baby and invite Woodward over.

When he arrived, he allegedly pulled a small piece of clear plastic with a powdery substance out of his pocket.

'With his right hand he pulled out a small piece of clear plastic with a white powdery substance from his right front pocket and started grinding the item on his pants just below the pocket,' a Los Angeles Police detective wrote in the 2009 court paperwork, according to the Daily News.

The investigation in 2009 did not lead to formal charges and prosecutors have spent years securing evidence in the case. Investigators spent that time interviewing additional witnesses, combing through medical records and conducting further testing on the powder, according to the Los Angeles Times.

'In the interim, there's been further investigation and analysis, and we obviously now decided what we deem appropriate charges,' Deputy DA Habib Balian said to NBC.

The Los Angeles Times reports that police have secured 'new evidence' against Woodward.

Woodward's attorney, Mark Werksman, said there is still no case against his client.

Misoprostol was initially FDA approved for the prevention and treatment of ulcers, but can also be used to induce labor or miscarriages of early-term pregnancies.

The commercial name, Cytotec, carries a label that warns pregnant women not to use the drug to treat ulcers.

The charges, he said, are an attempt to turn 'an unfortunate natural miscarriage of a 13-week-old fetus into a ghoulish attempted murder case.'Â 

'Nothing has changed in the last three years except the prosecution's determination to blame Joshua Woodward for the miscarriage suffered by his girlfriend,' Mr Werksman said to the Los Angeles Times.

'The evidence marshaled against him is so weak and speculative as to be nonexistent."

His then girlfriend has declined to comment.

The charges listed on court documents describe four instances from September 15 until October 25 when Woodward allegedly tried to induce an abortion.

He is formally charged with 'the crime of attempted, willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder...a Felony,' the documents state, explicitly claiming that Woodward 'did unlawfully and with malice aforethought attempt to murder Baby Doe, a human fetus.'

When asked why he was charged only with attempted murder rather than murder, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles District Attorney said 'We file charges based on the evidence. That is all we can say.'

Criminal law attorneys interviewed by MailOnline suggested that in order to prove he did commit murder, the district attorney would have to prove the fetus was 'alive.' Since the fetus was not viable at 13 weeks, that might present a difficulty. Woodward's intent, they said, would be simpler to prove.

Now a Florida resident, he faces four counts of life in prison. Woodward is no longer associated with the day-to-day of the restaurants he once co-owned.
