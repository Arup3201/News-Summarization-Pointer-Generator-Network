Christopher Lee, 38, appeared in court last year after repeatedly lashing out at contractors who came to upgrade his kitchen and bathroom

A 29-stone 'martial arts expert' who refused an electrician access to his housing association home 'because his snake was scared' could now face eviction.

Christopher Lee appeared in court last year after behaving aggressively towards contractors who came to upgrade the kitchen and bathroom at his home in Allerton, Liverpool.

The court heard how one occasion he refused to let an electrician in to his home because he said that his pet snake was becoming unsettled.

He was banned from being at home while further work was carried out on his property following the hearing at Liverpool Civil Court last February.

But it is claimed that the 38-year-old has since refused entry to gas safety experts who needed to take annual meter readings at his home, which is owned by Liverpool Mutual Homes.

Lee is also alleged to have intimidated several of his neighbours - and a change to his injunction order means that he could now face arrest if he acts in a threatening manner towards them.

The court heard that his dog Matrix, a Belgian Shepherd, was a nuisance and would often bark and bare his teeth, as well as being off its lead in communal areas.

Lee, who is unemployed, did not appear at the committal hearing at Liverpool Civil Court on Thursday when changes were made to the injunction order placed against him.

The order already grants landlord Liverpool Mutual Homes the power to evict him from the property with just 48 hours notice.

During the hearing at Liverpool Civil Court last year, it was heard how Lee kicked workers out of his house or refused them entry on a number of occasions.

The court heard how the workmen had to form a human chain to stop Lee, a trained fighter, attacking them. One man said that he was too scared of Lee to appear in court last year.

It was heard how, along with barring gas contractors, he has also continued abusing Liverpool Mutual Homes staff.

The case was adjourned for a month while experts assess if he has any mental health problems. He has previously complained of having gout.

Judge Graham Wood QC ruled that his capacity will now be independently assessed by a psychiatrist. A case management hearing will be scheduled in four weeks.

Judge Wood said: 'The great concern I have is that the question of Mr Lee's capacity has been raised.

Lee, who is unemployed, did not appear at the committal hearing at Liverpool Civil Court on Thursday this week where changes were made to the injunction order placed against him

'If he is unable to understand the order or the conduct of court proceedings then that weighs heavily on my decision to limit the power of arrest.

'I will grant power of arrest for paragraph three of the order for threatening violence to the four neighbours who are witnesses and their family members.

'They must be able to proceed confidently and should not in any way feel threatened of intimidated - they are entitled to that amount of protection.'
