The Muskegon Chronicle reported the groomsmen and bridesmaids got dressed in 
locker rooms at Lakeshore Sports Center before skating on the ice to Boyce Avenue's renditions of 'Wanted' and 'I'll Be There For You.'

Guests had the option of sitting in chairs on the ice or on benches behind the protective glass.

'When we first got together long ago we 
had this idea of a dream wedding, on ice,' Ben said.

'At the time it was
 in the woods on an outdoor rink in the winter. As we kept talking about
 it throughout our relationship, joking at times, we slowly conjured up 
this beautiful dream wedding that actually happened.'

Courtney skated down the aisle, escorted by her proud 
father Pat Benkert.

'I'm all torn up - you know how it goes,' Benkert said. 'This was awesome though. Ben is a good man.'

Once the wedding party took their positions, officiant Matt Bistayi invited guests to sit.

'You may now be seated, very carefully,' he joked.

The couple of eight years exchanged their personalized vows and tied a unity rope around their hands to signify their marriage, before leaving the rink through a tunnel of hockey sticks.

'The amount of love that every single person has for us is incredible,' Courtney said. 'Thank you so much to everyone.'

The reception was held in the Lakeshore Ice Center's second rink, featuring hockey-themed decorations and a scoreboard showing the couple's wedding date.
