Andrew Douglas has been sentenced to 12 months jail, suspended for two years, after being found in possession of almost 700 child sex images

A primary school teacher found with almost 700 child abuse images and banned from working with children has been told his offending would 'send a shudder down the backs' of parents.

Andrew Douglas, who now lives in Norwich, admitted making and possessing illegal images of children and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with supervision.

The father-of-two must sign the sex offenders register for 10 years and abide by the 
terms of a sexual offences prevention order for five years.

Newcastle Crown Court heard Douglas, 30, confessed to having a 'dark secret' for half a decade after being found in possession of 696 child abuse images, some of which were the worst of their type.

Judge Guy Whitburn told him: 'The very concept of a primary school teacher being in possession of images such as these would send a shudder down the backs of most who send their children to primary school.'Â 

The court heard there had been no complaints about Douglas' behaviour in the classroom at a Tyneside primary school, but his activities had been tracked online.

Douglas, who had one child and another on the way, has never been allowed to meet his new baby, born after his arrest, the court was told.

His ban from working with children signals the end of his career.

After being caught with the images, Douglas confessed to having had a 'dark secret' for half a decade (file picture). The victims were all older than the children he taught

The court heard the victims in the images were older than the children Douglas taught.

Caroline Goodwin, defending, gave the court references detailing Douglas' previous good character.

She said: 'They express shock from those who know him, it is completely out of character.'
