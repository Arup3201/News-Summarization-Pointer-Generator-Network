Tony Pulis has seemingly ended up on the wrong end of a prank call after a man impersonating Bolton boss Neil Lennon claimed to get through to the West Brom manager on his mobile phone.

The prankster Blain Morrison had left the Baggies boss a voicemail asking him to return the call as he was interested in taking defender Gareth McAuley on loan.

Pulis is said to have phoned back, and totally unaware that the man on the other end of the line isn't former Celtic manager Lennon, tells the man that he can't take McAuley because 'he plays every week'.

Pulis, 57,then apparently goes on to sing the Northern Ireland defender's praises, calling him a 'good lad' and says he is 'fantastic around the place'.

He then suggests that the fake Bolton Wanderers manager looks into taking Paddy McCarthy from his former side Crystal Palace.
