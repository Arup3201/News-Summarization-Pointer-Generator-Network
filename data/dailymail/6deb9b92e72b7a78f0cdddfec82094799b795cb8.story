The idea of pitching a tent in the great outdoors holds little appeal for the most dedicated urbanites.

But now city-dwellers can experience all the pleasures of sleeping under the stars without straying too far from the comforts of their luxury Manhattan hotel suite.

This Upper East Side hotel is letting guests set up camp on the terrace of their $700-per-night rooms - even throwing in traditional s'mores for the ultimate glamping experience.

Views: Rather than rolling countryside or lush woodland, urban glampers pitch their tents in the midst of Manhattan's concrete jungle

Rather than remote woodland or rolling countryside, urban glampers at the Affinia Gardens hotel pitch their tents in the heart of Manhattan's concrete jungle.

Traditional treat: In America, camping wouldn't be camping without s'mores

And instead of a few burnt sausages cooked over a campfire, guests can order strawberries and champagne from room service to complete their al fresco experience on their leafy garden terrace.

Not forgetting all the ingredients for s'mores - the popular American campfire snack consisting of a roasted marshmallow and melted chocolate sandwiched between two Graham crackers.

Urban glampers can also kit out their tent with deluxe hotel bedding and pillows - including one equipped with ultra-thin speakers to play music as guests drift off beneath the stars.

'This is a bucket list type of thing to do,' Steve Sasso, Affinia Gardens' general manager, toldÂ thestreet.com.

'New York City can be a once in a lifetime type trip, and this makes it even more memorable - it's one of those unique experiences you can't get anywhere else.'

Mr Sasso said the hotel introduced its glamping experience in response to requests from couples and families staying at the Affinia.

The option is open to guests staying in one of the hotel's terrace or patio suites, which range from $309 to $700 per night depending on the time of year.

The Affinia is one of a handful of New York hotels offering a similar experience, as part of a growing trend for glamping in the Big Apple.

Open-air luxury accommodation perched atop a skyscraper is becoming increasingly popular among tourists and locals.
