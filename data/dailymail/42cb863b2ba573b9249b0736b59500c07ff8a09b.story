Baby P's mother Tracey Connelly, 34 (pictured) has been sent back to prison for selling pornographic photographs of herself online

The vile mother of tragic Baby P is back behind bars after she tried to cash in on her appalling crimes by selling pornographic pictures of herself to perverts obsessed with her notoriety.

Tracey Connelly, 34, breached the terms of her parole by attempting to make the ‘depraved’ sales online.

She had been released less than 18 months ago on licence from a minimum five-year sentence for letting her lover and his brother torture 17-month-old Peter to death.

‘Authorities believe she was uploading images of herself and trying to flog them – possibly to sick perverts getting a kick out of her notoriety,’ a source told The Sun on Sunday. 

‘It doesn’t get any more depraved than this.’

Connelly is now back at women’s jail HMP Styal in Cheshire waiting for a Parole Board hearing expected to be held this week.

Her toddler son died in Haringey, North London in 2007 after suffering more than 50 injuries at the hands of her partner Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen over an eight-month period.

Overweight Connelly changed her name and dyed her hair before moving to a seaside town when she was freed in October 2013 on a life-long licence.

Her release sparked outrage. Connelly’s mother, Mary O’Connor, and father, Richard Johnson, said at the time their daughter should never have been freed.

Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, argued the case showed that the prison system ‘isn’t working’ for criminals like Connelly. 

He said: ‘It screams out there is no genuine rehabilitation for this type of offence. We see people that have committed these dreadful crimes are coming out and continuing along a similar pattern.’

In May 2009 Connelly was ordered to be held indefinitely, with a minimum jail term of five years, until ‘deemed no longer to be a risk to the public and in particular to small children’.

When she was freed from Durham’s Low Newton jail in October 2013, she begged for an anonymity order and police protection but was refused. 

Her release on a life-long licence came with the condition that any breach of her parole terms would land her back in jail.

The Ministry of Justice said: ‘Offenders on licence are subject to strict controls and conditions and are liable to be recalled to prison if they breach them.’

The horrific nature of tragic Peter’s death – despite being on Haringey Council’s at-risk register – shocked Britain.

He was found dead in his blood-stained cot at his mother’s flat after 60 visits from social workers and police. 

Peter was also twice admitted to hospital with suspicious injuries but the council failed to take him away from Connelly and her new boyfriend Barker.

At their 2008 trial, Owen and Barker were found guilty of ‘causing or allowing the death of a child’ while Connelly had pleaded guilty to the charge.

Barker was jailed for 12 years for the Baby P case and a life sentence for raping a two-year-old girl.

Owen was also jailed indefinitely and ordered to serve three years minimum. He was paroled in 2011 but sent back to jail after breaching conditions. He was released again last year.
