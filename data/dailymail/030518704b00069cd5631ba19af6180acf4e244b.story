Taxpayers are footing a £3million annual bill to pay for taxis to transport prisoners - even though a security firm already has a £420million contract to do the job.

The bill pays for prisoners to be ferried between prisons and courts, to visit sick relatives in hospital, or to go to funerals.

The cost was uncovered by Labour justice spokesman Sadiq Khan who called on the Government to 'get a grip'.

He told The Sun: 'Taxpayers will be outraged that they are stumping up millions to cart prisoners round in luxury taxis.

'The Government is already paying companies to move prisoners, and then taxis to do the same job. Why are we paying twice?'

Conservative MP Priti Patel called the cost a 'scandal'.

The £3million sum is the equivalent cost of buying 100 black cabs according to The Sun or a £37.27 fare for every inmate in UK jails.

The Prison Service claims that transport hire costs had been cut by almost ten per cent since 2010 and that efforts were being made to continue to reduce the cost.

The service was criticised last year after it emerged that millions of pounds was being spent on taxis, hairdressers and even actors.

According to reports, one cab firm was paid £920,000 for its work.

The Prison Service also spent £720,000 on professional actors for role playing that is aimed at helping inmates get into employment.

A spokesman said: 'Prison transport hire costs have come down by nearly 10 per cent under this Government and this is continuing to fall as we look for further ways to save money.'
