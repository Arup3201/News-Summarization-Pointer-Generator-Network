Kell Brook has revealed he thought he was 'never going to walk again' after he was almost stabbed to death during a holiday in Tenerife.

The Sheffield-born boxer needed life-saving surgery after his thighs were sliced open by a fellow Brit he had met in a bar hours before the attack.

Brook will step back into the ring on Saturday, just six months after the traumatic event back in September 2014, when he goes toe-to-toe with Jo Jo Dan.

Brook, pictured in September, thought he was 'never going to walk again' following the attack 

The world welterweight champion, speaking of his upcoming comeback, told the Independent on Sunday: 'I thought I might never walk again, let alone box.

'But thanks to those guys [the physio team at Sheffield United] I am great, very fit and healthy. My leg is bang on fine.'

The 28-year-old said he feared for his life after the incident and his life was 'flashing in front of' him as his leg was pouring with blood after the frenzied attack.

He added: 'The attack was unprovoked. One minute we were chatting, the next I was being macheted up. There was blood squirting out of my leg.

'I could see death, my life flashing in front of me. He stood over me shouting and swearing and I scrambled away.

'All I remember is thinking about my daughter and that I needed to get away from this; there was so much blood, I was covered in it. I really feared for my life.'

The 28-year-old boxer will be hoping to extend his unbeaten run when he takes on Jo Jo Dan
