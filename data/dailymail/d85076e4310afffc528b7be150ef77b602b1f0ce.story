Assaulted: Ray Widstrand, 26, suffered potentially fatal brain swelling after he was attacked by a gang of youths

The man who was beaten into a coma allegedly by a group of black teens as he was walking home would not want his attack turned into a race issue, his family said today.

Ray Widstrand, 26, was enjoying a late-night walk through 
his neighborhood on St Paul’s East Side on August 4 when he was attacked as he walked 
through a group of 30 to 50 juveniles and young adults.

He was hit in the head with a 'can in a sock', stomped on, had his pants ripped off him and was robbed. He was placed in a medically-induced coma when he was taken to hospital.

His family said though he has not been able to talk to them yet, he would not feel comfortable people feeling sorry for him.

He would want them to focus on 'positive things'.

His dad Peter said: 'He's a pretty private person. It's tragic, and I don't think he'd like that.

'I think he would want all the people in the community to work for a 
safer, positive community, and not tear people apart, and say it's this 
race and not that race. I think people of all groups are 
shocked at the violence.'

His sister Alice added: 'I think he would want the world to be a better place, and not worse, with more anger and hatred.'

Though he suffered 'potentially fatal brain swelling' and 'permanent and protracted loss of brain function' as a result of the beating, his family said they are encouraged by his recovery, especially after he sat up in his hospital bed and gave the thumbs up.

Peter told The Pioneer Press: 'It seems every day we see some steps 
forward. Every day, I see something,
whether it's in his eyes or something he does.

'[But] We're still in the place where we don't know if he'll return to work or return home. We might not know for years. Progress can stop tomorrow. It might not stop two years from now.'

The television producer had moved to an apartment in the Minnesota city two months before the attack and was working for a local community channel.

Family support: Ray Widstrand's parents Linda and Peter spoke during a press conference alongside his sister Alice, expressing their shock and disbelief as to why Ray was attacked

Crime scene: Mr Widstrand was walking through his local neighbourhood on St Paul's East Side when he was brutally assaulted, robbed and stripped

Brutal beating: After Mr Widstrand was knocked over one person was seen stomping on his head after which a third stripped him of his trousers to search his pockets

Speaking at a press conference, his father Peter said Ray had never ‘expressed any concerns’ about living on the East Side.

‘I
can't imagine why someone would do this to another person. Hopefully 
they will at least answer to that,’ Peter Widstrand added.

In custody: Isaac Maiden, 19, has been charged with over the attack on Mr Widstrand

The
large group was fighting on a street located mere blocks from the local
police station and turned the violence on Mr Widstrand when he tried to
get past them, witnesses told police.

A
local newspaper reported that the fight had started at a party nearby 
and a group of girls had taken it to the street after which the brawl 
escalated into a bust-up between local gangs.

‘An innocent man was walking down the street and brutally attacked by a group of youth,’ police spokesman Sgt. Paul Paulos, told Pioneer Press.

‘He was out for a walk and decided to go through this group and was assaulted and knocked unconscious.’

According to the police report, Mr Widstrand was hit over the head with a ‘can in a sock’ which knocked him to the ground.

Witnesses reported seeing blood coming
from his head after which a second man stomped on his head while a 
third removed Mr Widstrand’s trousers and the group searched his 
pockets.

Police found Widstrand lying on the ground, bleeding from his nose and mouth, his pants removed and shirt torn, according to a criminal complaint filed by the Ramsey County attorney's office.

Mr Widstrand is reportedly in a critical but stable condition and is expected to be brought out of the coma this week, his sister told PioneerPress.

'He's in the most difficult time right now, as far as swelling and cranial pressure. We're in that critical time,' his father said.

Isaac Maiden, 19, has been charged with first-degree assault, first-degree aggravated robbery and crime committed for the benefit of a gang.

He is being held with bail set to $150,000 and is scheduled to appear in court this month.

Maiden denies assault.

A further three male juveniles have been arrested in connection to the attack but no charges have been brought against them.
