A cap on political donations could be imposed without cross-party agreement in the wake of the ‘cash for access’ scandal under plans being discussed by ministers.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will lead talks starting this week aimed at forcing all three main parties to accept a donations limit.

This would be coupled with new restrictions on spending during elections and more flexible rules on the use of existing state funding of politics.

'Significant donor': Fares Fares and his wife Tania have dined with PM David Cameron at Chequers. Mr Fares has given the Tories £247,500 since 2008

But with all sides determined to defend their own interests, Government sources say legislation for a donations cap could be introduced even if talks fail.

The donations row has engulfed Number 10 this week after Tory treasurer Peter Cruddas was caught boasting he could secure dinner invitations to the Prime Minister’s homes in return for six-figure donations.

Mr Cameron, who denies that claim, was forced to release the names of 15 Tory donors who had been invited to dine with him at Downing Street or Chequers since he became Prime Minister. Together they have given the Conservative Party £25million.

Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to release details of private meetings with major donors by the end of this week.

Talks: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg

Senior Tories believe the main parties are doomed to never-ending sleaze allegations without radical changes to party funding because of perceived conflicts of interest between donors and government policy.

They accept they now have little option but to speed up party funding reform but insist it must apply to Labour’s multi-million pound handouts from the unions.

The Tories are proposing an annual 
limit of £50,000 on donations from individuals or companies, but are 
prepared to consider a lower threshold to secure agreement.

Conservative
sources say they cannot contemplate a donations cap unless Labour 
agrees that trades unions should have to require members to ‘opt in’ to 
affiliation fees going to the party.

‘If
Labour won’t agree we should grab the initiative and push new laws 
through the Commons – and dare Labour to vote against them,’ said one.

Radical
proposals made late last year by sleaze watchdog the Committee on 
Standards in Public Life have been rejected as politically  
unacceptable, since they would involve £100million more in taxpayers’ 
money going to political parties to compensate for a £10,000 donations 
cap.

Government sources say Mr Clegg, who 
is in charge of party funding reform at the Cabinet Office, will now 
press for a limit to be imposed even if there is no increase in state 
funding to sweeten the pill. He, Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband have agreed 
to open discussions on such a move.

It
would be coupled with a new cap on spending by parties at election time
to reduce the money they require, and an overhaul of the existing 
system of state funding.

Political
parties already receive millions of pounds a year from the taxpayer, 
including money to fund opposition activities in the Lord and Commons, 
special advisers’ salaries, grants for policy development and cash for 
direct mailshots by MPs.

Government
sources say that loosening the rules on the use of existing funding 
streams could help persuade parties to sign up to a donations cap. The 
three main parties have each nominated two representatives to take part 
in the talks.
