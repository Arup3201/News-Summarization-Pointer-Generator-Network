Christmas is still four months away - but for Apple fans, it might come as soon as October.

For Apple is believed to be launching an iPad Mini next month, and now fansite Apple.pro claims to have photographed the eight-inch evolution of the iPad.

Apple is notoriously secretive on the run-up to new launches, but leaks from within the industry, including from suppliers and partners, have all but confirmed the device is on its way this Autumn.

Almost ready for prime time? Website Apple.Pro revealed these images of the alleged eight-inch iPad Mini, due to launch on October 17

The Apple Mini is believed to sport an eight-inch screen, making it a shrunken version of the iPad's ten-inches.

This will allow a higher degree of portability over previous models, and also give Apple the ammunition to compete with Google, which recently brought out a seven-inch range of Nexus tablets.

Apple.Pro also reports this is a 3G-capable model, meaning you can use data on the go.

While Steve Jobs was famously against smaller iPads, the success of the Nexus and Amazon's 'Fire' of budget tablets appears to have convinced Apple there is a market for the slim-line device.

Rumours from Apple suppliers suggest the innards of the Mini will be equivalent to an iPad 2, which analysts suggest will be more than enough to power the shrunken device.

The third iPad had a specification increase but also increased slightly in weight due to the demands of the high-definition Retina display.

According to these images, the iPad Mini comes with dual speakers on the rim, as well as the newly-designed dock connector

Apple is also believed to be announcing the iPhone 5 during September, although it has not yet confirmed a launch date.

The
 new device which is expected to boast a display of less than eight 
inches will be unveiled at a separate event, so as not to dilute the 
impact of the iPhone's launch, according to analysts.

'I donâ€™t think Apple would want reviews of both a new iPhone and new-size iPad appearing at the same time,' said Daring Fireball's John Gruber.

'Why share the spotlight? Why have another Apple product battling with the iPhone for the top spots in news coverage?

'The
 more I think about it, the less sense it makes for the iPhone to even 
share the stage at the announcement with any other product.

'The
 iPhone is too big, too cool and garners too much attention - and it's 
in Apple's interest to keep that attention undiluted.'
