Viewers of Channel 4 word game Countdown were left gasping when it hit a peak with a near-the-knuckle answer.

Letters chosen during one round of the long-running show were capable of spelling the word 'orgasmed', with the eight-letter contribution then displayed by the programme’s Rachel Riley who posed next to it.

Contestants had to find the longest word possible from the selection of nine letters which had been chosen - E, A, S, R, P, G, O, M and D.

Satisfactory result: Rachel Riley next to the eight-letter word 'orgasmed' on popular quiz show Countdown

The best efforts by the players were the six-letter 'grapes' and seven-letter 'grasped' in the edition of the afternoon show screened yesterday.

But the team in dictionary corner - lexicographer Susie Dent and impressionist Alistair McGowan - were able to come up with something better.

McGowan suggested: 'There’s a seven (letter word) in "dampers", another one, and Susie "orgasmed".”

Show host Nick Hewer responded: 'Oh, well done. Very good.'

Riley - recently a contestant on BBC1’s Strictly Come Dancing - then arranged the letters on the board to spell it out.

'Orgasmed' has had multiple appearances, occurring in the final as the series climaxed three years ago when Jeff Stelling was the presenter.

In 2010 the hosts of the long-running show were left with red faces when the F-word popped up by surprise.

Riley cringed as the letters U, D, F, C, K, E all came up in the contestant's selection - and host Jeff Stelling gave a wry smile.

Viewers sat with bated breath in case the two contestants decided to go for the obvious six-letter word - and trigger a flood of complaints.

But instead of putting the six letters together for the ancient Anglo Saxon expletive, the contestants went for 'caged' and 'faced'.

Later that year Countdown raised giggles again when producers settled on a very suggestive final word scramble.

Eyebrows were raised on the afternoon show when the clue letters spelled out 'LARGEBAPS.'

And again in 2010 TV bosses had to axe a round after a contestant offered up an expletive during filming of an edition.

Competitors were given DTCEIASHF, but they were given a new set of letters and asked to try again when Cambridge University student Jack Hurst produced the word ‘s***face.

Dictionary corner expert Susie Dent told presenter Jeff Stelling the term for a ‘rude or obnoxious person’ would have been acceptable.

However the station decided it was not suitable and a fresh selection of letters was used.

Channel 4 said at the time: ‘Countdown is a daytime programme and this particular word was not deemed appropriate for a daytime audience so not included in the show.’

A racier version of the programme - 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown - has recently been screened on Friday evenings with more adult themes.
