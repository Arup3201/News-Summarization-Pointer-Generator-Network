A seventh person has been arrested over the murder of Australian businessman Robert Ellis in Bali.

However, police believe another suspect is still on the run three months after the alleged slaughter.

Adolf Malo Rangga, 34, was detained by police on Saturday evening having evaded arrest since October 2014. 

It’s reported Rangga was located by authorities on Indonesia’s Sumba Island whilst drinking with family members.

The accused tried to escape through the kitchen, before finally cooperating when cornered by police, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Mr Ellis’ death was ‘no doubt an execution-style murder’ according to a senior police officer in the Bali capital, Denpasar. 

He was found with his wrists and feet tied, wrapped in plastic and dumped in a ditch in the rice field near Sedang Village. 

Mr Ida Bagus Putu Alit, who heads the district's forensic team, said Mr Ellis' throat had been slashed three times. 

Detective Wisnu Wardana gave more detail, explaining 'there was a deep wound to the neck that had almost completely cut the head.’ 

Police allege Mr Ellis’ Indonesian wife  confessed to ordering his murder because he cheated on her 'often'.

'The motive is because his wife felt embittered with the victim,' Badung police chief Komang Suartana told News Corp. 

'Because of many things. She said that her husband is often cheating on her. We allege that she paid the executioners to kill her husband.'  

Officials said Mr Ellis, who has been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife

In early January police reportedly handed a brief of evidence to prosecutors in early January which claimed the victim’s wife paid hit-men 150 million rupiah, or $14,200 AUD, according to The Daily Telegraph.

Officials confirmed that Mr Ellis had a UK passport and had lived in Australia before moving to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife. 

He has two children, Jon and Peter Ellis, who study at Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia from his relationship with Noor Ellis. 

He also has two children from a former relationship. At the time of their father’s death, the four children and Mr Ellis’ brother John released a joint statement. 

‘Bob was a loving and devoted father, grandfather, brother, son and husband. His loss leaves a hole in the lives of everyone he touched.’ 

‘His work in business created jobs for thousands of Indonesians. He was a good and honourable man. 

'His integrity, generosity and spirit is evidenced by the way the business community both expat and Indonesian have rallied to support us and show their respects.’
