It is the last date three consecutive numbers will line up for 90 years, giving mathematicians and number fans in Britain a chance to celebrate. 

Thousands are planning to mark the occasion on Wednesday by getting married.

But one retired teacher in California is offering $1,112.13 to whoever can think of the most original way of commemorating the unique day.

Unique: This date will never happen again and the next 'sequential date' will not occur for another 92 years

Ron Gordon, who will be judging the competition, calls the date 'noughts and crosses day' because of the pattern of consecutive numbers in a row.

The 68-year-old and his wife Linda, 51, from Redwood City will be giving the cash prize to: ' The most consequential sequential celebration.'

Mr Gordon said: 'Such a sequence will not happen again this century.

Odd Days - There are only six dates every century that comprise of all odd numbers. The last for 92 years occured last month on November 9 (9/11/13)Trumpet Day - 2/22/22Square Root Day - 4/4/16 (the last one was on March 3, 2009)Ladybug Day - 10/11/12Ones Upon A Day 1/11/11

60,000 couples married on 7/7/07 in the US (this was a Saturday)

The last two consecutive days were November 10, 2012 (10/11/12) and October 9, 2011 (9/10/11)

'These days are like calender comets. You wait and wait for them, then they brighten up your day and poof- they're gone.

'Some say the next Noughts and Crosses Day properly arrives on 1/1/1, on the shoulders of the next century.

'That day, however, seems to be booked ahead by New Year's.

'If it's three in a row as this, we won't see the like again until 1/2/3. Sadly enough, that's an 89-year wait.

'So if we're judged technically wrong in our designation, we can still all enjoy our last hurrah - there won't be another Noughts and Crosses Day this century.

'We are giving away the date in dollars but nobody gets a large chunk. We just like to see a lot of different people taking an interest in patterns in numbers.

'The truth is we don't get enough interest so anybody who enters will effectively be a winner.'We're looking for more people to get involved.

'We are hoping to get 36 entries altogether, and will be picking the winners at New Year. Winners also get a very handsome certificate.

'The competition money comes out of what I don't drink in coffee every year.

'Maths purists say we are not being 'pure' to maths, or call it "sandlot maths", but I don't care. 'Clearly, it's not a day to quarrel - let's celebrate!'

They have offered a number of suggestions on their website, prompting entrants to write a poem, a story, host a 'glorious winter gathering' or organise a festival of noughts and crosses.

But they have also tried to get people mark the date by sharing it with a friend.

Iconic dates have also been targeted by couples looking to tie the knot.

According to the David's Bridal annual survey, more than 3,000 weddings are said to have taken place in the US on November 12, 2013, compared with 371 weddings on the same date the year before.

For Americans, the last consecutive 
series of the century will occur next year, 12/13/14, and a record number of couples are expected to married because it falls on a Saturday.

But there will not be a similar sequence in Britain until 1/2/3 - February 1, 2103.

The next day of numerical significance is in nine years on November 22, or 22/2/22.

It is also called Trumpet Day, because when it is spoken allowed, it sounds like the brass instrument.

Last month, mathematicians celebrated 'Odd Day' on November 9 (9/11/13) a phenomenon which only happens five times every 100 years.

Talking about odd day, Daily Mail astrologer Jonathan Cainer said the numbers meant little in terms of astrology, but added: ‘The calendar itself has thrown up a series of numbers that make us stop and consider. So we can interpret this date as having potential for positive change in our lives.’

In nine years: The next date of numerical significance is Trumpet Day - 22/2/22 or November 22, 2012

Rare: Retired teacher Ron Gordon said dates such as Wednesday are 'calender comets' because they only come around so often
