Aston Villa’s progress to the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley was marred by a mass pitch invasion in which West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper Boaz Myhill was repeatedly shoved by taunting fans.

Thousands of Aston Villa supporters swarmed on to the pitch in celebration, sparking fears for West Brom players who had to fight their way off and down the tunnel.

And the ugly scenes also led to calls for the Football Association to punish Villa for allowing the disturbances to occur.

Goalscorer Fabian Delph, who was surrounded at the final whistle, said: ‘That was very, very scary.

‘My armband got nicked, someone got my left boot, but I could appreciate the relief the fans are feeling after a result like that. It was dangerous. Someone tried to take my boot off. People tried to kiss me and were biting me. It was scary.’

Hundreds of fans had spilled on to the pitch from the Holte End minutes before the final whistle — forcing their way past meagre numbers of stewards — prompting Villa players to appeal for them to return to the stands. Those who remained in their seats booed loudly, chanting ‘*******’.

Leicester coach Kevin Phillips slammed the disturbances, calling for the Football Association to punish his former club. Phillips, who played for both Villa and West Brom, said: ‘I can see West Brom players still on the pitch which for me is very dangerous. For me this has been very badly policed. Why are there still away players on there? They should be punished for it.

‘These people on the pitch are not true supporters, the true fans are the ones who are booing to get them off.’

Former Liverpool star and TV pundit Mark Lawrenson added: ‘It’s like a scene from the 1980s all over again. Absolutely ridiculous.’

Albion winger Callum McManaman was visibly shaken and Myhill reacted angrily at fans trying to film him by snatching one phone and flinging it to the ground.

It took stewards more than 20 minutes to march the fans off. West Brom fans also ripped out several seats and confronted Villa fans when Scott Sinclair scored a second.
