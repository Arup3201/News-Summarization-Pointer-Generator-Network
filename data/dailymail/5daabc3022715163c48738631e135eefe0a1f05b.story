The family of Cliff Richard have defended the singer, who is currently being investigated over an alleged sexual assault on a boy under the age of 16 at a religious event in 1985.

Sir Cliff’s cousin Garth Gregory, 59, branded the police raid on the singer’s Berkshire on Thursday home a 'witchhunt'.

Meanwhile his niece Linzi Jolin, added: 'I know my uncle is innocent.'

Sir Cliff, who was in Portugal when the police raid took place and was playing tennis with friends there last night, could fly back to be interviewed under caution as early as today.

They are also angry at South Yorkshire Police 
officers, who have been blasted for the way the they have conducted the 
case so far, reports the Sunday Mirror.

Officers admitted to working with journalists before searching the £3million home.

But the force has complained to the BBC and accused it of breaching its own editorial guidelines after the broadcaster found out about a search the force was planning to carry out at the home of the pop star.

The singer's Berkshire penthouse was searched for five hours on Thursday by officers from South Yorkshire and Thames Valley Police as part of the investigation.

Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve accused the police of having a 'collusive relationship' with the BBC.

Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, the prominent barrister said: 'I can see that police might not want to warn somebody about a search because they fear a suspect will destroy the evidence.

'But it was much odder to tip off the BBC that they were carrying out the raid. That seems quite extraordinary.'

South Yorkshire Police said it was 'disappointing' that the BBC was slow to acknowledge that the force was not the source of the 'leak'.

It acknowledged that it did confirm to a reporter at the corporation the date of the search of Sir Cliff's house, but only because the BBC had already contacted the force to say it knew about a planned investigation.

Sir Cliff, who was in Portugal when the search took place, firmly denied any wrongdoing and hit out at the fact BBC journalists were apparently tipped off about the plan.

A press helicopter was reportedly at his home before police even arrived.

In a statement the force reiterated that 'at no point' had it leaked information, which has been confirmed publicly by the BBC.

On Friday Jonathan Munro, the BBC's head of news gathering, said there had been lots of questions about the original source of the story, tweeting: 'We won't say who, but can confirm it was not South Yorks Police.'

South Yorkshire Police said: 'The force was contacted some weeks ago by a BBC reporter who made it clear he knew of the existence of an investigation. It was clear he (was) in a position to publish it.

'The force was reluctant to co-operate but felt that to do otherwise would risk losing any potential evidence, so in the interests of the investigation it was agreed that the reporter would be notified of the date of the house search in return for delaying publication of any of the facts.

'Contrary to media reports, this decision was not taken in order to maximise publicity, it was taken to preserve any potential evidence.'

During the miners strike of 1984 officers from South Yorkshire attacked miners, before arresting 95 on the charge of rioting, at the Battle of Orgreave. Afterwards it was found that the force had fabricated evidence, carried out false arrests and assaulted miners.

In 1991, it was forced to pay out half a million pounds to 39 miners who were arrested.

Michael Mansfield QC described the evidence given by South Yorkshire Police as 'the biggest frame-up ever' and said that the force had a culture of fabricating evidence.

It was for Hillsborough, in which 96 people died, that the force was condemned by Prime Minister David Cameron in September 2012 for their handling of the event, which led to an apology from the current Chief Constable David Crompton.

The Hillsborough Independent Panel found the force had attempted to divert blame from their own mishandling of the tragedy by feeding false information to the media and altering statements given by their own officers.

It added: 'South Yorkshire Police 
considers it disappointing that the BBC was slow to acknowledge that the
 force was not the source of the leak.

'A
 letter of complaint has been sent to the Director General of the BBC 
making it clear that the broadcaster appears to have contravened it's 
editorial guidelines.'

The force added that it would now welcome an investigation into the original leak.

A
 BBC spokeswoman said: 'A BBC journalist approached South Yorkshire 
Police with information about the investigation. The BBC agreed to 
follow normal journalistic practice and not to publish a story that 
might jeopardise a police inquiry.'

Cliff Richard has already spoken out against the BBC, claiming they were alerted to the raid before he was
