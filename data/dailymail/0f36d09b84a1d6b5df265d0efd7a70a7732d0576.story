Before coming out as a transgender female, Kellie was better known as international boxing promoter Frank Maloney, who took Lennox Lewis to become the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the world. 

Earlier this year she shocked the macho world of boxing by announcing her decision to change her sex and live as a woman.

Kellie, 61, is now undergoing a raft of cosmetic treatments to become a woman. This week she had a state-of-the-art semi-permanent make-up treatment at Harley Street clinic Debra Robson LDN.

Transformation: Kellie Maloney has undergone a two-hour semi-permanent make-up treatment  to create more feminine features on her eyebrows, eye line and lips

She underwent the two-hour semi-permanent make-up treatment  to create more feminine features on her eyebrows, eye line and lips.

The two-hour appointment included an eyebrow treatment, which claims to add a more feminine defined arch, a treatment to accentuate and widen her eyes, and a lip treatment, which promises to re-shape and boost the natural lip colour.

During the treatment Kellie said: 'If I hadn’t come-out as a woman, I wouldn’t be laying here on a beauty clinic treatment bed, I would be laying on a slab in an undertakers. That was the choice I had, it was either let it beat me and have the depression kill me or come out and embrace the world.'

'On my way to the clinic today, some girls stopped me and said they really admired what I was doing and how brave I was. But I don’t put it down to bravery, I put it down to being a necessity of what I had to do.'

Kellie admitted that the semi-permanent make-up treatment was going to be a great help for her because she isn't yet an expert at doing her own make-up.

And she added: 'I find it really hard to do eyeliner, I smudge it every time, and this will help me so that when I get up out of bed in the morning I don’t have to spend so much time doing my make-up, and I’ve always wanted my eyebrows to have a more feminine arch and look more natural - and hopefully a bit more beautiful.

'When I was Frank I tried to keep my eyebrows quite fine, and I always wanted to have arches. I was quite vain as Frank but now I’m even vainer as Kelly.'

In action: Since coming out as a woman this August, Kellie, pictured being treated by Debra, said she has looked to female role models like Lorraine Kelly, Charlotte Hawkins and Suzannah Reid to model herself and her new look on

To prepare for the treatment Kellie had her eyebrows and lips covered with an anesthetic cream for 20 minutes, then the shape and size of the eyebrows were carefully measured and the outline of the new shape was created with an eyebrow pencil. When Kellie was happy with the shape, Debra started the treatment with a pen device which holds ultra-fine needles.

Debra matched the chosen pigments to the natural colour of Kellie’s eyebrows, and with precisely simulated hair strokes, create a defined lift to the arch of the brow - Kellie said this would be similar to that of daughters Sophie, 19 and Libby, 13.

Since coming out as a woman this August, Kellie said she has looked to female role models like Lorraine Kelly, Charlotte Hawkins and Suzannah Reid to model herself and her new look on, but she admitted during the treatment that the most important influence on her is from female members of her close family.

Helping hand: With the new semi-permanent make-up, Kellie admitted most people don't think she looks like a man anymore

Kellie said: 'To be honest, my three daughters are my role models and they help me! Also my mum has been totally unbelievable since she was told about 15 months ago.  

Power Brow from £760

Eye Intensifier (top and bottom lid) £1,000

Kiss Proof Lip treatment £1,270

Total: £3,030

'My two eldest ones, who are quite big now, don’t call me dad, but my 13-year-old she still does. I still get a few funny looks but as people recognise me as Kellie now so they don’t pay me as much attention.'

And she added: 'My mother tells me not to wear heavy make-up every day, she tells me I must let my skin breathe. My mother hardly wears much make-up - a little bit of lipstick and bit of powder, and she’d just wear a bit of Nivea cream and she still uses it today, she’s 81 and she’s got beautiful skin. She looks like she’s in her 60s. We are very close now and she’s very protective of me and she sits and shows me pictures of her when she was younger and she’s stunning.

'When I look at my daughters and I think what fun they have, and how they look, I think I will never experience that, but the experience I have now is like starting all over again.

'My three daughters are very helpful for me getting my style right and I sit and watch the TV presenters, and shows like Sex and The City and Friends and I would model myself on them.

'I would walk along and watch women walking along the street and how they dress. When I first came out, I would never wear jeans. I wanted to look natural but unfortunately I’m very recognisable.'

But with the new semi-permanent make-up, Kellie admitted most people don’t think she looks like a man anymore. 

Kellie added: 'I wonder what my colleagues would think now if they can see the semi-permanent make-up treatment that I’ve had? I’ve heard a few stories from people in the boxing world who think it’s all one of Frank Maloney big stunts and that I’ve fooled you all and I want to stay as Frank.

'But I think to myself they have got to be crazy, no human being would put themselves through some of the treatment that I’ve been having - the hormones, the electrolysis, the operations - this semi-permanent treatment is fine, but the other stuff isn’t nice.

'And I’m going to have surgery in Belgium in November on my nose because my nostrils are too big and they are going to lift the eyes and then on January 13th I’m going to have my operation and breasts done.

'But I’m so pleased with the semi-permanent make-up I’ve had, my face looks so much more feminine now. I’ll definitely come back to have a top up a couple of times a year.'
