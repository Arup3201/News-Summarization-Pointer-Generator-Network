Admission: Star jockey Frankie Dettori has confirmed he took cocaine, just as his six-month racing ban came to an end

Shamed star jockey Frankie Dettori today admitted for the first time he took cocaine, just days before he returns from a six-month racing ban.

In his first television interview since his 'one night of madness' last year, the 42-year-old Italian said he was 'ashamed and embarrassed' he was caught taking the Class A drug.

He was banned from horse racing after cocaine was detected in his system at Longchamp racecourse, in Paris, on September 16 last year.

Authorities have now cleared him to start again on Monday, at Leicester, with the first race on the card called the Welcome Back Frankie Maiden Stakes.

'I’m very ashamed and embarrassed, and 
paid a very big price for it, you know. I spent six months not doing the
thing that I love, racing,' he told Channel 4 News.

'Things were going bad, I was depressed and I guess a moment of weakness
and I fell for it and I’ve only got myself to blame. I can’t blame 
anybody else.

'The embarrassment of when it come out, I had to hide in my house for a 
week. The paparazzi outside. The embarrassment of telling the children, 
you know. You know they still go to school, they might get bullied and 
so it was a very, very difficult time'.

During an interview to be broadcast tomorrow, he spoke about the impact on his private life and his future in racing.

When he was caught the record-breaking jockey, famed for his gymnastic victory celebrations, confessed he had let his guard down in a moment of weakness, explaining that he feared his job was 'going down the drain'.

He said he had only himself to blame for the six month ban, but claimed his misdemeanour was due to his fear of being pushed out of the spotlight.

He said: 'It got to the stage where I wasn't flavour of the month any more and the love was gone.'

It was a huge blow to the household name sportsman who shot into the public imagination in 1996 with a ‘Magnificent Seven’ wins at Ascot.

He frequently makes public appearances with his wife, Catherine, and their five children, who live near Newmarket, Suffolk.

He was awarded the MBE in 2000 and in 2002 became a team captain on the BBC show A Question of Sport, but quit the following year when he was apparently stung by a question from a participant as to when he had retired from riding.

Earlier in his career, in 1993, Dettori
was given a police caution after being caught with a small amount of 
cocaine in his pocket in London.

In
his autobiography he admitted that he become a ‘tearaway, a night-club 
wolf, a drugs dabbler who was perilously close to seeing his career go 
permanently off the rails’. 

In
a BBC Newsnight programme he also admitted taking diuretics, chocolate 
laxatives and even Lasix, to keep his weight down, before the Jockey 
Club outlawed them in 1998.

Frankie Dettori was cleared to return to action on Monday, and the Italian was at the British Horse Racing Authority (BHA) in London yesterday when he completed the final round of tests and examinations imposed upon him by the sport's regulator.

Successful: Frankie Dettori receives his prize from The Queen after winning the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes on Daylami at Ascot in July, 1999, one of many wins for the jockey

Dettori has been the subject of urine testing and 'non-notified' testing over the last four weeks.

The shock test came shortly after it was announced his 18-year association with Sheik Mohammed's Godolphin operation was ending.

Dettori, who has been riding for a clutch of trainers, is expected to come back at Leicester's evening meeting in five days time.

Unbridled joy: Frankie celebrates his seven out of seven with a flying dismount from Fujiyama Crest

Frankie
Dettori will forever be etched in Turf legend for what he 
achieved on an unforgettable afternoon at Ascot in 1996.

On Queen Elizabeth II Stakes day, with the BBC cameras rolling, he went through the card with seven winners from seven rides - his 'Magnificent Seven'.

It was a historic occasion within the sport, but it resonated in the big wide world, too, securing a special place in popular culture for the Italian jockey.

The cumulative starting price odds for anyone who had the good fortune to back the winners - and plenty did - were 25,095-1, though 'early bird' prices suggest the true odds against it happening were 235,834-1.

Dettori began by winning the Cumberland Lodge Stakes (Group Three) on Wall Street (2-1), and followed that when Diffident (12-1) scrambled home by two short heads in the Diadem Stakes (Group Two).

Both horses were owned by his Godolphin paymasters, who also provided his mount in the day's feature Group One race, the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes.

Mark Of Esteem was sent off a 100-30 chance and put up a career-best performance in beating crack filly Bosra Sham by one and a quarter lengths.

Bookmakers were getting twitchy by now, and Dettori did little for their heart-rate by landing an easy victory in the Tote Festival Handicap on John Gosden's 7-1 chance Decorated Hero.

With the yankees already in the bag, Fatefully (7-4) won the next race, another handicap, by a neck in the Godolphin colours, and number six came up when the Ian Balding-trained juvenile Lochangel (5-4) led all the way for victory by three-quarters of a length in a conditions event.And so to the remarkable seventh race.

As punters heaped money on Dettori's mount Fujiyama Crest, bookmakers slashed the odds - and prayed for it to be defeated.

Dettori bounced him out of the stalls and was soon in front, playing catch-me-if-you-can, and as they turned into the final straight he was still there as the crowd's roars reached frenzied proportions.

Pat Eddery delivered a fierce challenge on Northern Fleet, throwing everything into the finish, but Fujiyama Crest held on by a neck.

Dettori returned to the winner's enclosure among delirious racegoers and shell-shocked bookmakers, while off-course the number crunchers were totting up losses to the industry of about £30million, with William Hill over £8m down and Ladbrokes even more.

The day was immense for Dettori, both for his unique place in racing history and for his image outside it.

Little wonder then that when the opportunity arose to acquire a special memento of the day, he took it - and bought Fujiyama Crest.
