The video begins with Mitchell greeting viewers with a can of beer in one hand and a shoe in the other. 

He is filmed walking over this his dad who is taking a shower with the bathroom door open. 

'Hey dad, guess what? The AD [Angry Dad] page reached 300,000 likes,' Mitchell says in the video. 

'To celebrate, you've got to do a "mad shuey".'

But his father is unimpressed with the idea of being filmed while nude and drinking beer from a shoe.

'Get out of here you f****** perv!' he yelled and then tells the boys to turn the camera off. 

However Mitchell is adamant that his father must complete the challenge.

'You've got to scull it. Drink it,' he said and soon decides to throw it over his father instead.
