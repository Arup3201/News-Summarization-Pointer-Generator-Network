Labour's biggest union donors pay nothing in corporation tax despite making millions on their investments, new figures reveal today.

Ten unions affiliated to Labour raked in almost £10 million from their investments last year.

In total, the unions concerned have given Labour more than £21 million since the last election.

But, despite attacking tax dodging by major companies, none of them paid a penny of corporation tax on their profits.

Instead they exploited an obscure provision in the law which allows them to offset costs such as sick pay, accident compensation and employment tribunal costs against their income.

The giant Unite union, which is Labour’s biggest donor, has stocks and shares worth £54.4 million, which generated an income worth more than £2 million.

The GMB, which has given Labour £4.5 million since the election, has investments worth almost £21 million.

These generated an income of more than £1.6 million.

The Community trade union, another Labour donor, has investments worth £67.2 million, generating an income of £4.1 million.

None of the unions concerned paid any corporation tax on their stock market portfolios.

In total, the unions had investment income of £9.7 million. If they had paid 20 per cent corporation tax on the total they would have received a tax bill of just under £2 million.

There is no suggestion that any of the unions broke the law.

But Tory MP Charlie Elphicke last night accused them of hypocrisy and called on Ed Miliband to challenge them over their tax affairs.

‘Tax avoidance isn’t just a problem with big corporations. It’s also a problem with big unions who bankroll the Labour Party.'

Mr Elphicke, a former tax lawyer, said: ‘Tax avoidance isn’t just a problem with big corporations. It’s also a problem with big unions who bankroll the Labour Party.

Despite heavy income from stocks and shares, these union bosses have seen no need to contribute.’

The Tory research is based on official figures provided to by the unions to the Certification Officer, who audits their affairs.

The big trade unions have been amongst the biggest critics of corporations and wealthy individuals accused of dodging tax.

Unite boss Len McCluskey accused Starbucks of ‘daylight robbery’ after figures emerged showing it had paid corporation tax in only one of its 15 years of operations in the UK.

GMB boss Paul Kenny called for a Parliamentary inquiry into corporate tax dodging last year following reports that a private sector healthcare provider was based in the Channel Islands to minimise its UK tax bill.

Mr Kenny accused firms of ‘sticking up two fingers to hard-pressed UK families while they enjoy tax free profits from our pockets.’

But union sources last night pointed to a provision in the law that allows them to offset so-called ‘provident benefits’ paid to members against their profits from investments.

The loophole means that costs ranging from funeral expenses of a member to the costs of representing people at employment tribunals can be set against any potential corporation tax liability.

A spokesman for the Community union said: ‘Everything we do is transparent, legal and subject to public scrutiny.’

A Unite spokesman said: ‘Unite and other unions save the state money by providing benefits to their members the cost of which might otherwise fall on the taxpayer.

'This has been recognised by governments of all parties since Victorian times. We are not a profit-making organisation, we have no shareholders and no-one benefits other than our members.

‘If the Tories want to find hypocrisy, let them examine their tax-dodging donors.’
