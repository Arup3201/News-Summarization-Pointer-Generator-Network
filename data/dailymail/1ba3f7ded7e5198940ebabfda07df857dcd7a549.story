Maybe Floyd Mayweather is right. Perhaps people are so blinded by their irritation with his garish lifestyle outside the ring that they cannot see his genius when he knuckles down in sport’s hardest work-place.

So eager are so many of the public – and some of the pundits – to see him lose that they cannot bear to watch how brilliantly he wins.

Which, by the way, he has now done in all 47 of his professional fist-fights.

There is something ludicrous about a grown man who is so obsessed with earning hundreds of millions dollars that he nicknames himself Money disposing of so much of that hard-earned cash on over-priced bling.

But that should not affect judgement of his phenomenal boxing talent.

By no means everyone at the Las Vegas ringside on Saturday night gave Mayweather credit for the brilliant way he snuffed out the wild, raging, often illegal and, yes, outrageously biting assault on his record and his world titles by Marcos Maidana.

It was a masterful performance of bewildering elusive movement – which defied his 37 years – and explosive power, which frequently left his younger challenger not only pawing at thin air but gasping for the breath to survive.

Lots of Money but no fun, complained some, presumably choosing to ignore how the humorous way he personally redirected the befuddled and frustrated Maidana when he kept wandering towards the wrong corner at the end of the round.

Mayweather expresses indifference to such lack of admiration but there can be little doubt that it irks a man who is so preoccupied by his legacy that his cap bears the log TBE… The Best Ever.

Yet he continues to prevaricate about meeting the one opponent he needs to defeat if he is even to be considered as great as the two Sugar Rays – Robinson and Leonard.

Manny Pacquiao was the other name on everyone’s lips as future opponents for Mayweather were discussed.

It has been for years now and unless they trade blows before one of them retires the public will be entitled to feel deprived.

Even so Mayweather, having said initially ‘Let’s make it happen,’ immediately back-tracked into his tired and inappropriate demand that the PacMan’s promoter Bob Arum would have to be excluded from the $300million event.

That has given rise to optimism that our own Amir Khan will finally get his chance, next year, to prove that his speed can wreak the downfall of Mayweather, who he assesses as ‘looking older and slower.’

That expectation is fuelled further by Mr Money, grand master that he is, pondering a different end game.

Having declared his intention to retire after two fights next year, he has shifted the ring posts again by hinting that he may not box again until September 2015.

The excuse is that his body may need a year to fully recover from his physical effort against Maidana but the intention could well be to extend his career into 2016.

By then the MGM Grand hotel and casino, the home for his mega-fights, will have constructed a new, state-of-the art indoor stadium significantly large than the 16,000-plus capacity Grand Garden they use at the moment.

Mayweather volunteered to take part in the ground-breaking for that project on the eve of his first fight with Maidana this May.

So who better to inaugurate that glittering venue? What more glitzy way for Mayweather to climax his career? And who else to invite to participate in that spectacle other than Pacquiao, in the fight which would define them both.

The man they love to hate appears to be planning to give everyone what they want.

Boxing says a prayer for Wilson 

Sheffield boxer Jerome Wilson is reported to be in ‘critical’ condition following a brain operation after he was knocked out in his home town on Friday night.

The 29-year-old welterweight’s plight comes as a grim reminder of the risks which all fighters take, be it on a Mayweather mega-millions production in Las Vegas or for a modest purse in a local hall.

Across that entire spectrum, the boxing fraternity will be praying for one of their number in distress.
