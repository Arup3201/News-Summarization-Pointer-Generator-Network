Bedford has been crowned the UK's most generous town, according to data gathered by  JustGiving.

The donation site compiled its list based on the number of givers and the amount donated in relation to populations.

Of those 79,150 people with a 'Bedford postcode', more than half (41,631) gave a total of £1,145,967 to charity appeals on the site in the year to May 2014.

Cambridge and Reading were denied top spot by Bedford, with Brentwood, Woking, Aberdeen (the only non-English representative), Cheltenham, High Wycombe, Watford and Bristol making up the top 10 ranked towns.

This was determined by calculating how much a town had donated via the site - adjusted to account for the number of donors relative to the population size.

The Mayor of Bedford Borough, Dave Hodgson, said: 'It's fantastic to hear that Bedford has come out on top as the most generous town in the country, but it's no surprise.

'I know how generously people give not only their hard-earned money but also their time and energy both to national and to the many excellent local charities.

'Charities and individual fundraisers do incredible things in aid of charitable causes locally, and they are clearly very well supported by the generous, warm-hearted people of Bedford Borough.'

The data only reflects donations made via JustGiving, the UK's largest charity fundraising website which is widely used for people undertaking sponsored events to raise money for good causes.

It does not take into account other charity donations made by people such as putting cash in collections, making payments via direct debits and standing orders, or through other online services.
