It is one of America's most iconic buildings - and now the firm that gave Chicago's Wrigley Building its name has sold up for a reputed $40million.

In what has been seen as a bargain deal because of its high vacancy rates, the site has been snapped up by investment firm BDT Capital Partners.

The new owners include Brad Keywell and Eric Lefkofsky - two co-founders of discount website Groupon Inc.

The 460,000 sq ft building will keep its name and the site includes an adjoining 1.5 acre lot.

Byron Trott, BDT's managing partner, said: 'We are committed to the success and redevelopment of this architectural treasure to ensure that it remains a vital part of Chicagoâ€™s future economic progress.'

He said Wrigley will lease space at the Michigan Avenue building until 2012, when it will relocate its headquarters to its campus on Goose Island.

The city's baseball stadium, home for the Chicago Cubs, also bears the company's name.

And he added that Groupon had 'no immediate plans' to enter the site.

Experts told the Wall Street Journal that the price looked to be cheap because of 'high vacancy rates' in the building.

The iconic two-tower skyscraper, which was the first air-conditioned building in Chicago, is modelled on Seville Cathedral's Giralda Tower in Spain.

Located on Michigan Avenue on the north bank of the Chicago River, at the southern most point of Chicago's Magnificent Mile, it is made up of two sections connected by an open walkway at street level and two enclosed walkways.

Work began on the site in 1920.
