A medical school graduate died early Saturday after Connecticut police subdued him twice with a stun gun in an 8-hour period.

Lashano Gilbert, a Bahamian man who attended medical school in Cuba, was in New London visiting family when police say he tried to carjack a woman.

Officers first subdued the 31-year-old when his arrest turned to a struggle. They did so again when he attacked officers in the police station.

What killed him? Bahamian medical school graduate Lashano Gilbert, 31, was tasered twice by New London, Connecticut police over the weekend and subsequently died

Heard voices: State police have opened an investigation into what killed Gilbert, who officers say was acting erratically and said he heard voices

He died en route to a hospital and now state police have placed the matter under investigation.

Medical examiners performed an autopsy Sunday. Results of a toxicology test won't come for weeks.

It's possible those results could shed some light on the state Gilbert was in when police first encountered him Friday.

NBC Connecticut reports that when police say Gilbert, while in an 'altered state of mind' and 'speaking in a bizarre manner,' attempted a carjacking.

Gilbert reportedly told police he was hearing voices and when he behaved in a threatening manner toward them, they used the stun gun.

He was taken to a hospital and treated, then taken to a New London police station.

Police say while in a holding cell Gilbert began twisting his pants as if to make a noose. He bum rushed police when they opened the cell to take the pants.

In the commotion, Gilbert was tasered a second time. He was rushed to the hospital again and died around 3:30am Saturday.

New London's state's attorney and New London police chief immediately asked the state police to start an investigation, according to NBC Connecticut.

That investigation remained open as medical examiners autopsied Gilbert's remains.
