We might wring our hands and roll our eyes at endless health and safety rules.

But it seems that when there’s a job to get on with, there are still plenty left in Britain who don’t mind a bit of old-fashioned make do and mend.

Caught on camera by shocked passers-by, this lot haven’t let a lack of proper equipment stand in their way.

One horrified onlooker caught a car passenger precariously holding a ladder in place through a car window on a busy dual carriageway while travelling at 50mph.

The man was spotted on Tuesday clinging on to the metal ladder with his outstretched arm (pictured) as he travelled along the busy A666 dual carriageway in Bolton, Lancashire - which has a 50mph speed limit

A man was spotted sitting in the back of a blue Nissan, clinging on to the metal steps with his outstretched arm as he travelled on the major road.

Passing motorists said they could not believe what they were seeing as they witnessed the potentially catastrophic scene.

Builder Steve Wignall, who caught the antics on camera, said: 'Okay, it looks funny but I was a bit annoyed.

'I've got two young kiddies and there's a potential for a really bad road traffic accident.

'It's not what you expect to see on the dual carriageway coming out of Bolton.'

The incident took place on Tuesday morning on the A666 in Bolton, Lancashire. Another man was driving the car.

The speed limit on the busy road, which runs between Salford and Langho is 50mph.

Father-of-two Mr Wignall has run his own construction business for two years and has been in the building trade for 20 years and is well aware of the strict health and safety rules in place to protect himself, workers and others.

He added: 'You would normally put them [ladders] in a van but it wasn't big enough. 

'There are roof bars you can use that are specifically for ladders.

'Hopefully the driver will read all about his stupid antics and think twice before doing it again.'

Of course, in the interest of public safety, this sort of behaviour does tend to land you in hot water - if you are caught.

Another incident which emerged yesterday saw two men heavily fined after they tried to fix a 30ft street light with a precarious DIY crane - made from a forklift truck and some pallets. 

Costly: Builders Jonathan Shaw, 44, and Stephen Fawcett, 69, were fined £8,000 each for this escapade

Jonathan Shaw, 44, and Stephen Fawcett, 69, were reported to the council by a passer-by who snapped a shot of the pair’s forklift antics.

Fawcett was standing on a metal cage designed to be attached to the truck and had no harness or safety equipment to prevent him from falling.

There were also no preventative measures in place on the ground to stop people from coming within dangerous distance of the machinery.

The escapade in Morecambe earned them each an £8,000 fine, with Lancaster Magistrates’ Court condemning the arrangement as at best ‘precarious’ and at worst ‘reckless’.

And builder Steve Wignall, who spotted the ladder winding its way towards Bolton, said he was ‘shocked’ by the sight, although he did end up conceding: ‘It was a bit funny.’
