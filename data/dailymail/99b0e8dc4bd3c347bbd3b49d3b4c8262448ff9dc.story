Wood you believe it? Johannes, 35, spends up to five months painstakingly planning and perfecting each of his amazing creations

Johannes, from South Tyrol in Italy, said: 'I did my first bodypainting experiment in 2000.

'Five years earlier I had the idea to paint a human body but it took me until I was 23 to try it.

'The experience was so special that I wanted to do it again immediately - I wanted to try it with different colours, a different model and a different motive.

'I couldn't imagine that there would be a way to earn money with bodypainting, but nevertheless I was totally convinced that I wanted to do it - I felt that it was my way.

'I found out about the bodypainting world championship and took part for the first time in 2009.

'To my amazement I finished fifth, and that was the beginning of a new bodypainting era for me.

'From that moment I was fixed on winning the world title.

'I started bodypainting full time, and in 2012 my hard work finally paid off - I won.

'It was one of the best feelings in my life.

'Bodypainting is special because the artwork is alive and can move.

Use yer melon: Johannes says he observes 'the world, nature, colours and shapes with very clear eyes and an open heart'

'While a canvas painting lasts forever, a bodypainting exists only for a few hours.

'The skin is very different to canvas - it is alive, it is soft and warm, it is a very comfortable base to paint on.

'There are some designs I can do in just a few hours while others take up to eight hours.

'In bodypainting you create unity between an image and a person.

'A lot of my inspiration comes from nature.

'I think I observe the world, nature, colours and shapes with very clear eyes and an open heart.

'And painting is my big passion. I think the secret of good work is to always have a love for it.'
