Dejan Lovren says Liverpool cannot afford to defend the way they did against QPR when they face Real Madrid.

Liverpool conceded two late goals in a 3-2 win at Loftus Road on Sunday and despite winning the game, QPR had a number of good chances.

Brendan Rodgers’ side face Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday at Anfield and Lovren knows Liverpool must defend better if they are to keep out Cristiano Ronaldo and Co.

Dejan Lovren admits Liverpool cannot afford to defend the way they did against QPR when they play Madrid

Liverpool know they are up against it on Wednesday as they have managed 17 goals this season - two less than Ronaldo who has scored 19.

And Lovren said: 'Obviously, Ronaldo is an amazing player. Eight games, 15 goals in La Liga this season. But it's not just Ronaldo, you can't just concentrate on him because you have other players who are scoring goals. We need to be like a team.

'We will not play as we did against QPR when we play Real Madrid, you can be sure of that. We will be better.

'We cannot play the way we did against QPR because we know what we can expect from Real Madrid. Their players, we know who they are and we will prepare a little bit different.

Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 19 goals this season - two more than the whole of the Liverpool team combined

'It's not daunting. It's a pleasure to play against these players. I am not afraid. No-one in our team is afraid. We respect their players but we will show something completely different on Wednesday.'

Liverpool have three points from their first two games in this season’s Champions League ahead of back to back games with the current holders.
