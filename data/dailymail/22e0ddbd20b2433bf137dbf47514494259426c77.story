Today 35,000 runners will line up at the start of the London Marathon. And I can guarantee that for most of them, the hardest road won’t be the one ahead (and that won’t be easy) but the one that got them there.

Training to run 26½ miles is no mean feat. I should know. In 2012,  I achieved a personal best time of two hours 54 minutes – quite an accomplishment considering that I started as a keen amateur jogger a decade ago, in my early 30s.

I’m not running this year and last year I missed the big race as I’d just given birth to my daughter, Anya. And as a busy mother of two – my son Devon is seven – fitting in exercise can be a squeeze. But I’m already training to run the marathon again next year.

Nell McAndrew is already training for next year's London Marathon. Here she tells readers how to get fit for the big day, while smiling at the same time

Fortunately we now know that endless long runs are not the best way to prepare for a marathon. Research shows that short bursts of intense exercise – known as high-intensity interval training (HIIT) – are a better way to get in shape for endurance running than pounding the pavements or treadmill for hours.

A long weekly run of 5km is still a priority, but it’s preferable to split the session into a series of shorter, pacier jogs with rests.

Of course, if you love to run, you don’t have to give up. Instead, intersperse a 40-minute jog or brisk walk with these exercises, all of which can be done using improvised equipment – such as a log, fence or park bench. Each takes just a minute or so, so the whole thing feels fresh.

Did I mention it’s fun? Pushing yourself to the limit can be hard – but all the leaping, hopping and bouncing makes me break out in a huge grin.

THE PROGRAMME

If you’re training from scratch – whether for a 5k fun run or a full marathon – take at least 12 weeks to prepare.

Aim
 for three or more sessions a week. At least two should be HIIT 
sessions, in which you run or walk briskly for five minutes, followed by
 one HIIT exercise – done quickly, aiming to take not much more than 
three minutes, with no rests between sets – and then repeat.

The
 whole routine will take about 50 minutes. The focus is on leg 
exercises, although the upper body isn’t neglected – arms matter for a 
good running technique. If you’re pushed for time, jog for five minutes,
 then just do the exercises.

Reserve
 one session a week for longer runs. Instead of 5km in one go, try a 
kilometre at your best pace followed by a two to three-minute rest, then
 repeat five times.

BOX JUMPS

WHY: Jumping over a tree trunk might sound like a game, but it uses almost every muscle in the body.

If you can’t find a fallen  tree, try jumping up on to a  park bench, or start small by  using the front door step – but step down carefully so as to protect the ankle.

Jumping over a tree trunk uses almost every muscle in your body

HOW: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, close to the obstacle you think you can either completely jump over or jump up on to.

Squat so your thighs are almost at right angles to your calves. Use your arms to start momentum, swinging them forward then back, and push off as hard as you can with both feet to propel yourself over/on to the ‘box’.

Try to land as quietly as you can. Either step down or turn around and repeat.

DO: 3 sets of 15 to 20

BUNNY HOPS

WHY: Another one  that might feel a bit silly, in a good way. 

You will need a bench without a back – or that trusty log, if you can find one. This couldn’t be simpler but is a fantastic all-over body workout, and rather exhausting when you do a lot of them!

Nell McAndrew illustrates the bunny hops which is a 'rather exhausting' all-body workout

HOW: Stand on one side of the bench, bending  over with your hands  on it, with your knees slightly bent.

Jump both legs over the bench together.  Land on the other side. That’s one rep.

Try to keep your  weight over your chest  so your feet can land light and springy each time. Focus on keeping your abdominals pulled  in throughout.

DO: 3 sets of 30 to 50

TRICEP DIPS

WHY: Dips work the backs of the arms and will help tone them up. A bench  or that trusty log is needed for this one.

Tricep dips: Work the backs of the arms and will hope tone them up

HOW: Sit up straight on the  long edge of the bench or log, legs slightly extended, feet flat on the ground.

Place your hands palms down, fingertips just curled over the edge, on both sides of the bench just outside your hips.

Without moving your feet, bring your bottom forward, off the bench.

Steadily lower yourself. When your elbows form  90-degree angles, push yourself back up to starting position. If you want to make this easier, bring your feet closer to your body.

DO: 3 sets of 10

PRESS-UPS

WHY: To keep your core strong. When you are struggling in a run and you want to sprint to the finish, your upper body will help you do this.

HOW:  On the ground in plank position, set your hands at a distance slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Angle your hand in a way that feels comfortable.

Press-ups: To keep your core strong. When you are struggling in a run and you want to spring to the finish your upper body will help you do this

The wider apart your feet, the more stable you’ll be. If it’s too difficult, you can rest on your knees.

Your bottom shouldn’t be sticking way up in the air or sagging. You should be looking slightly forward not down – your chin should touch the floor first.

At the top of a push-up, your arms should be straight.

Steadily lower your body until your elbows are at a  90-degree angle.

At the lowest point, pause slightly then push fast and with energy back up to the start.

DO: 3 sets of 10

ONE LEG SPLIT SQUATS

WHY: The fallen log will again become your ‘gym bench’ – and this move is a  great way to work the hip flexors, bottom and backs of legs, and improve balance.

HOW: Stand about 3ft from the bench,  facing away from it, feet shoulder width apart, hands on hips.

One leg split squats: This move is a great way to work the hip flexors, bottom and backs of legs

Move one foot back so that your toe is resting on the bench. Your other foot should be stationary, a little in front of  your body – keep your head up to stay balanced. Make sure your back is straight and chest proud.

Inhale, slowly lower your leg until your thigh is parallel to the floor. Your knee should be over your toes.

Leading with the chest and hips, elevate your leg back to the start as you exhale. Halfway through, switch legs.

DO: 3 sets of 10 to 20

SUSPENDED SINGLE LEG SQUATS

WHY: This targets the thighs, but also the upper body and core. You need a suspension trainer – an adjustable nylon strap with hand grips. You can get a simple one for about £60.

HOW: Lasso suspension trainer around fence or tree (strong enough to partly support your weight) so straps are running upward at slightly more than 45 degrees.

Hold handles with a light grip, somewhere between horizontal and vertical.

Feet should be about shoulder-width apart. Lift a leg  up, pointed in front of the body.

Maintain alignment and distribute weight evenly through the middle of the grounded foot.

Inhale and squat on one leg (keeping opposite leg from the floor), until squatting leg is parallel to the ground.

Push up to the start and repeat. Switch legs halfway through set.

DO: 1 set of 10 to 2

SPRINTERVALS

For sprint intervals, you should aim to run as fast as you can for between 15 and 30 seconds, then slow down to a very gentle jog for a minute, and repeat. 

The first couple of times, you might 
feel exhausted after about four or five intervals, but aim to build up 
to eight sprints. Push yourself hard. The next time you go out on a 
steady run you will be amazed how you feel much more comfortable in your
 usual pace.

The fitter you become, the faster you will recover.

Sprintervals: You should aim to run as fast as you can for 15-30 seconds
