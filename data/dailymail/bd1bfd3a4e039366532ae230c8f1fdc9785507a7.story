Police and protesters clashed for a third straight night as a mob descended on the streets of Brooklyn, New York on Wednesday to show their rage at the police shooting of 16-year-old Kimani Gray.

There were chaotic scenes in the neighborhood of East Flatbush as police in riot gear and with helicopters overhead clashed with over a hundreds of protestors.

About 100 people attended the vigil, many of them holding lit candles and some of them 
shouting before a group broke away and confronted police.

There were several arrests - including a
relative of Gray - as well as incidents of protesters being 
pepper-sprayed and protesters throwing objects at police cars.

An autopsy report released earlier on Wednesday has revealed that Gray died from seven gunshot wounds after he allegedly pointed a loaded weapon at cops.

Two
plain-clothes anti-crime cops got out of an unmarked car and tried to 
approach Gray who began fiddling with his waistband, police said.

The teen turned and pointed a .38 caliber revolver before the two cops fired a total of eleven rounds, police sources said.

On Monday, some protesters turned to vandalism and violence. Bottles and fruit were thrown, bus windows were broken and a Rite Aid drug store was ransacked.

There are contradictory reports regarding the moment leading up to Gray's death.

Police say they came across a group of young men on Saturday evening and saw Gray acting suspiciously, walking away from his friends when he saw the officers approach.

Officers say the 16-year old began to adjust his waistband and then turned around and pointed a .357 caliber gun at them.

When the two plainclothes officers saw the weapon they responded by opening fire.

The teen was rushed to a local hospital but he later died.

However, witnesses to the shooting say that the NYPD's account is wrong.

Gray’s older sister, Mahnefah Gray, 19, told the New York Times that one of the witnesses of the shooting told her that her brother was only fixing his belt.

She added that her brother had too much ‘common sense’ to point a loaded gun at an officer, and doubted that he was even carrying a gun at all.

A woman who lives across the street from the scene of the shooting told the Times that Gray was calling out: ‘Please don’t let me die!’ and said the officers yelled back: ‘Stay down, or we’ll shoot you again.’

Grey lived in nearby Crown Heights, but had grown up in East Flatbush and returned there to visit friends. His older brother, Jamar, was killed in a car accident two years ago.

According to witnesses, when the two cops arrived on the scene in an unmarked car, Gray was part of a group of six teenagers standing by the side of the road.

One of Gray's friends, Devonte Brown told the New York Post: 'As the cops opened fire, he was screaming, ‘Stop! I’m not running!’

His friends have not explained exactly what caused the police officers to shoot.

Police say Gray's gun was loaded with four bullets but have not yet determined whether the teenager fired his weapon.

Gray had been in trouble with the law before, having been arrested three times since October and had previously been charged with grand larceny and inciting a riot.

Gray, whose pictures show him sporting beads worn by Bloods members, was arrested on almost a dozen charges since turning 16 last year. His arrests include grand and petty larceny, possession of stolen property and inciting a riot.

Police recovered a weapon and said several bullets were missing. It’s not believed that Gray fired on cops.

A 30-year-old sergeant with eight 
years on the job shot Gray four times, while a 26-year-old 
officer who has five years on the job fired seven times, the source 
added.

‘He was facing them when he pointed the gun,’ the police source said.

Cops fired from the front and the 
teen was hit twice in the right thigh. He spun around to get hit in the 
back of the each thigh, once on the left forearm, once in the lower rib 
cage and once in the left shoulder, another police source explained.
