The UK will host a crucial Nato summit next year for the first time since 1990, when Margaret Thatcher was in power.

David Cameron will invite leaders of the 28 North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries to London just as 87,000 troops are due to draw down from Afghanistan.

The Prime Minister said the defence alliance remained ‘a relevant force fit for the 21st Century’.

The summit will also be used to pay tribute to the ‘contribution and sacrifice’ of the allied troops as ‘Nato draws down its forces and looks to help Afghanistan in different ways’.

Mr Cameron added: ‘The summit will also be about the future of our alliance.

‘Britain has always been at the forefront of shaping the alliance, from its start in 1949 to Nato’s current operations.

‘The 2014 summit will be critical in ensuring Nato remains a relevant, modern, adaptable force fit for the 21st Century.’

Nato chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the summit would be ‘an opportunity to mark the conclusion of our ISAF mission at the end of next year, while opening a new chapter in Nato’s engagement with Afghanistan’.

The alliance was set up in 1949, with the emergence of the Cold War.

It continued as the West’s main riposte against the threat of the Soviet Union and its satellite Communist states.

But Nato’s relevance has been questioned with the decline of the Cold War. There have also been rows between members over a reluctance to militarily intervene in Syria.

Foreign policy experts view the 2014 summit as the most important Nato meeting since the end of the Cold War.

Dr Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society thinktank, said: ‘By bringing the summit to the UK, the Prime Minister has clearly demonstrated that his commitment to Britain’s role in the world is unshaken, despite recent political difficulties over Syria.

'Hosting the summit is a clear signal that the Prime Minister and his Government fully intend to ensure Britain carries the burden of defending our values in a multipolar world, where those who do not share them are in the ascendancy.

‘This is a vital summit, the stakes for which are very high. It will allow Britain to host what may well turn out to be the most crucial NATO summit since the Cold War.’

The summit will also take place the same year as the Scottish independence referendum. Scottish nationalists want an independent Scotland to continue to be a Nato member.

But the Scottish Government’s anti-nuclear stance puts it odds with Nato’s key defence strategy, which centres around keeping a nuclear deterrent.
