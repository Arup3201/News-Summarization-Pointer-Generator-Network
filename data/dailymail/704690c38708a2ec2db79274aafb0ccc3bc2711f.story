A footballer has died from an injury suffered on the pitch following a horror challenge during an Indonesian Premier League match.

Persiraja striker Akli Fairuz was injured after taking a boot to the body from PSAP Sigli goalkeeper Agus Rahman as the pair raced for the ball in the area.

Players, clearly incensed by the tackle, clashed on the pitch while the referee had to be moved away by security.
