Filmmakers have been told they must meet stringent new targets on diversity if they want to win grants from one of Britain's biggest arts bodies.

The British Film Institute, which hands out £27million a year, has introduced a 'Three Ticks' system which includes quotas on the number of actors and crew who are female, gay, working-class, disabled or from ethnic minorities.

Once the system takes effect in September, budding filmmakers must satisfy at least two out of the three categories before they can be eligible for funds.

The BFI has told filmmakers they will have to meet their new diversity targets if they are to receive funding in the future. Its headquarters is pictured in Southbank, London

Despite MPs raising concerns about so-called 'quota' systems in the past, the move was praised by culture minister Ed Vaizey, who said it would 'raise the bar' to make films reflect modern Britain.

The BFI, a government body which distributes millions in lottery funds, is now recruiting a 'diversity expert' to ensure its rules are put in place correctly.

In advice about its new rules, which it said are obligatory, the BFI gave examples of films which should be seen as models of 'telling diverse stories'.

They include Belle, which depicts the struggles of the illegitimate mixed-race daughter of an 18th Century Navy officer, and Gone Too Far, a film about a streetwise teenager on a south London housing estate who meets his long-lost Nigerian brother.

Another is Pride, a romantic comedy about gay activists in 1984 featuring Bill Nighy.

In order to comply with the rules, films must 'tick' at least two out of three categories from 'on-screen diversity', 'off-screen diversity' and 'creating opportunities and promoting social mobility'.

On the set, film companies will be asked to ensure 30 per cent of supporting and background characters 'positively reflect' diversity.

The British Film Institute wants filmmakers to satisfy at least two out of three of its criteria if they are to win funding for new projects.

The government body, which is employing a 'diversity expert' to ensure rules are put in place correctly, has set out its three categories as follows:

1. On-screen diversity: diverse subject matter, at least one lead character positively reflecting diversity, at least 30 per cent of supporting and background characters positively reflecting diversity

2. Off-screen diversity: diverse key creatives (director, screenwriter, composer, cinematographer), at least two Heads of Department from diverse backgrounds, production crew and production company staff (both with a range of targets across different diverse groups)

3. Creating opportunities and promoting social mobility: paid internships and employment opportunities for new entrants from diverse backgrounds, training placements for people from diverse backgrounds

In the off-screen category, at least two heads of department would have to be from 'diverse backgrounds'.

The
 third category requires film-makers to provide 'paid internships and 
employment opportunities' and training placements for people from 
diverse backgrounds.

The 
initiative, which the BFI says is backed by UK producers’ association 
Pact as well as ethnic minority recruitment and training charity 
Creative Access, will be rolled out from September.

Last
 month, Conservative MP Philip Davies hit out at BBC pledges to ensure 
that one in seven actors and presenters will be black, Asian or from 
ethinic minorities within the next three years.

The BFI also helped to fund the film, Philomena, starring Judi Dench, left, and Steve Coogan, right. Future films will have to tick two out of three new boxes to satisfy new diversity targets

And he told MailOnline today that recruiters should be 'blind' to matters such as religion, race and gender, adding: 'This sort of political correctness is the kind of thing that makes people's blood boil.'

But defending the BFI scheme, culture minister Ed Vaizey said: 'This initiative from the BFI should help raise the bar and ensure BFI lottery funded film productions reflect diversity both in front and behind the camera.

'I want to continue to see the TV, film and the performing arts industries actively discussing how they can drive change and improve diversity right across these sectors.

'I hope others will follow the BFI in developing and implementing possible solutions.'

BFI chief executive, Amanda Nevill said it was 'vital' that the film industry represented society, to ensure the sector remained 'really relevant'.

The BFI Film Fund is the largest public film fund in the UK, investing more than £27m into film development, production, international sales and distribution, and supporting around30 new film productions each year.

But in advice about its new criteria, which it said are obligatory, the body gave examples of films which it now considers should be seen as models of 'telling diverse stories'.

They include Belle, which depicts the struggles of the illegitimate mixed-race daughter of an 18th Century Navy officer.

The British-made film, released in the UK last month, has made nearly £5.8million at the box office, and starred Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Tom Wilkinson, Miranda Richardson and Matthew Goode.

Another example was Gone Too Far, a film about a streetwise teenager on a south London housing estate who meets his long-lost Nigerian brother.

The movie, starring Malachi Kirby and Shanika Warren-Markland, explores tensions between wthnic minorities on the estate and premiered at the 2013 BFI London Film Festival.

It also singles out Pride, starring Bill Nighy, which charts the lives of gay activists and their attempts to support the miners' strike in a village community in Wales.
