Gina Lollobrigida yesterday declared she never slept with her Spanish toyboy.

The 85-year-old Italian actress is demanding her marriage to Javier Rigau be annulled, saying the ceremony was conducted in her absence and without her permission.

The star refused to go into intimate details of her time with the Spanish property developer but said: ‘We never had a physical relationship.’

'Dragged through the mud': Javier Rigau, seen with Lollobrigida, is threatening to sue the Italian star over her claims he duped her into marrying him

She implied the couple did have a 
close relationship before their current troubles, saying:  ‘We were 
never just friends. But we certainly aren’t friends now.'

Miss Lollobrigida says Mr Rigau, her 
companion for almost two decades, duped her into signing a legal 
document consenting to a proxy marriage in Barcelona.

Legend: Lollobrigida was once dubbed 'the most beautiful woman in the world'

The star once 
dubbed ‘the most beautiful woman in the world’ claims the Spaniard wants
a claim on her £35million estate.

Secret video released by her manager at the weekend appeared to show Mr Rigau admitting he had never been married.

Publicly, the 51-year-old insists Miss
Lollobrigida, who starred with Humphrey Bogart, Burt Lancaster and Sean
Connery in the 1950s and 1960s, agreed to marry, with a mutual friend 
as a stand-in.

He said: ‘I cannot remain silent 
because my only asset is my name and it’s being dragged through the mud.

'If I have to take action against my wife, I will do.

'We’re married even
if she now doesn’t want to be, so much so that if I wanted to wed again
in the future I’d have to divorce Gina to avoid becoming a bigamist.’

He says he signed a prenuptial agreement renouncing any claim to her wealth.

But she told the Daily Mail: ‘He is a 
b*****d. It appears to have been a conspiracy, involving a number of 
people including lawyers and those in public office. I have proof and it
will become clear in court.’

Miss Lollobrigida lives in a 
spectacular  villa just outside Rome on the ancient Appian Way. Mr Rigau
lives in a mansion in one of Barcelona’s most sought-after 
neighbourhoods.

Sour: The pair were engaged in 2006, but Rigau backed out at the last minute declaring he could not handle the media spotlight
