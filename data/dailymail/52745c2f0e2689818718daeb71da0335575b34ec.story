A lesbian has created a unique sex toy, which also serves as a means of at-home artificial insemination. 

Stephanie Berman, a reproductive health expert from Boston, came up with the clever concept, which she named the Semenette, after examining the other available methods of at-home fertilization open to her and her wife. 

'The only options other than going to a doctor's office would be with a turkey baster or a needle-less syringe,' Ms Berman told Refinery29 about her creation, which retails for $139.99.

Breaking with tradition: Unlike a turkey baster or a needle-less syringe, which can also be used as a means of artificial insemination, the Semenette (pictured) is also intended to pleasure the user 

'We started using those types of things and quickly realized it was as awful as it sounds. 

'There is nothing romantic or sexy and fun about trying to impregnate your wife with a turkey baster.'

The mother-of-one began looking into alternative designs, which would use the same pump-based technology as a turkey baster - one of the more traditional at-home means of artificial insemination - but also enable the user, and their partner, to enjoy the process of impregnation.

And while Ms Berman initially intended for the toy, which comes complete with a pump, to be used by lesbian couples, she explained that it will actually serve as a great fertilization aid for anyone who might not be able to get pregnant using traditional means - and who does not want to go through IVF. 

'When my wife and I wanted to start a family, we thought about our options and weren’t necessarily happy with any of them,' she added. 

'I started thinking, what if I could recreate the technology that a turkey baster would provide, but in the form of a sex toy? 

'That would be the perfect scenario - it would not only allow both partners to be really involved in the process, but it would allow for privacy and authenticity and intimacy.'

Ms Berman and her wife Kiersten Marie, who used the Semenette when conceiving their one-year-old baby daughter Isabella, have received an outpouring of support and praise from a variety of people from different communities.

Thus far, the entrepreneur's unique creation has been used by transgender and transsexual couples, men with erectile dysfunction and even heterosexual couples, who, Ms Berman explained, still 'enjoy the sensation' of using the Semenette. 

The Turkey Baster Method is widely thought to be the most common means of at-home artificial insemination.

While some women choose to use a traditional turkey baster, a needle-less syringe will also serve the same purpose. 

The method involves women using semen from their boyfriend or husband, or from a willing donor, which they then inject into themselves using a turkey baster or a needle-less syringe.  

Women who are eager to use this method are advised to attempt it on the day of ovulation and the 2-3 days before ovulation.

While the success rate of the turkey baster method is thought to be reasonably high, some women, like the Semenette's creator Stephanie Berman, have complained that it causes discomfort, and it is not known to be particularly enjoyable for the user.  

However, the method is still favored by women who do not wish to undergo IVF.

Indeed, the product has proved so successful that the businesswoman has launched a new crowdsourcing campaign on Indiegogo.com in the hopes of funding the Semenette 2.0, which will come in a wider variety of colors, shapes and sizes, according to its website. 

'Up to this point, we [have] manufactured 500 units in three realistic colors, Vanilla, Cinnamon and Chocolate,' Ms Berman explains on her Indiegogo page. 

'With your contribution, we will manufacture the Semenette V2 in new non-realistic color options (tell us what color you want to see), make different sizes of the toy, larger bulbs... and use a softer silicone to enhance the comfort and feel of the toy.'

And Ms Berman insists that the Semenette should not just be viewed as a means of insemination - but can also be used by couples, or single people, who are looking to get a bit more creative in the bedroom. 

'I’ve had people use this at bachelorette parties, and they put alcohol in it,' she added to Refinery29. 

'You have to take into consideration what you’ll be introducing into the body. A lot of people will use lubricants... 

'It sort of depends on what your desires are, but the most common things in there are probably lubricant or other stuff that's okay to be put on or in the body.'
