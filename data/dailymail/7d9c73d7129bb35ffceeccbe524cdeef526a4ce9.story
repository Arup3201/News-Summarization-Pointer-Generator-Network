Not mincing words: Ex-NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly had some harsh words for his colleagues in Ferguson, Missouri, saying that the local police should have been more forthcoming with details on the shooting 

Former New York City Police Department commissioner Raymond Kelly has weighed in on the volatile situation in Ferguson, Missouri, upbraiding local authorities for their handling of the Michael Brown shooting.

Kelly, 72, who served as New York City's top cop for more than a decade, had some harsh words for Ferguson’s law enforcement, calling on the town's officials to release information about the shooting of the 18-year-old unarmed black teenager.

In a phone interview with Bloomberg News Tuesday, Kelly said that the Ferguson Police Department might have prevented some of the violence that engulfed the community had it been forthcoming with the details of the deadly confrontation between Brown and Officer Darren Warner.

‘It certainly has the potential for quelling or lessening disturbances,’ Kelly told Bloomberg News. ‘You tell them what you know and tell them what you don’t know, rather than dribbling it out.’

Kelly, who currently heads risk management services for real estate brokerage Cushman & Wakefield Inc, was likely alluding to his department's response to the 2006 killing of Sean Bell - an unarmed African-American man who was fatally shot by officers 50 times outside a Queens nightclub on the eve of his wedding.

Bell's violent death sparked anger among African-American leaders and the community at large, but no widespread riots or looting.

What if: Kelly suggested that Ferguson police officials, among them Chief Thomas Jackson (pictured), might have prevented some of the violence by releasing details about the shooting in a more timely fashion 

Recent history: Kelly was at the helm of the NYPD in 2006 when his officers shot Sean Bell, a 23-year-old unarmed black man,  50 times outside a nightclub  

Officer Wilson shot Brown six times August 9, but it was not until nearly a week later that information started trickling out about the incident and the 28-year-old cop at the center of the firestorm.

‘The toothpaste is out of the tube here,’ Kelly said. ‘There’s lots of things that should have been done differently, and you have to live with them.’

Mr Kelly, who stood at the helm of the NYPD from January 2002 until December 2013 as part of Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s administration, also did not mince words when addressing the skewed racial makeup of the Ferguson police force.

The former top cop called it 'mind-boggling' that only three out of the 53 cops serving the Missouri town were black given that Ferguson was nearly 70 per cent African-American.

While much has been written and said about the presence of armored vehicles and officers in tactical gear more often seen in combat zones than American suburbia, Kelly stopped short of calling out the perceived over-militarization of Ferguson’s police.

Racial makeup: Ray Kelly said that it was 'mind-boggling' to him that Ferguson's police had only three black officers in a city that is nearly 70 per cent African-American in its makeup

'Not their core mission': Kelly said that National Guardsmen who were called in to restore order in the St Louis suburb were not trained for policing the streets  

He did, however, note that National Guardsmen who have been called up by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to restore order in Ferguson were not trained in 'policing tactics.'

In 2011, Kelly came under sharp criticism from civil libertarians for cracking down on Occupy Wall Street protesters in Manhattan.

Kelly was also attacked in the media for perpetuating the controversial stop-and-frisk policy, under which hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, the vast majority of them minorities, were subjected to searches by police.
