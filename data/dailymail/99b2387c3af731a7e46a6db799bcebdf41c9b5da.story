Joel Campbell is going the extra mile to get himself ready for the new season with Arsenal after hopping into a freezing ice bath in Austria.

The striker, who spent the previous campaign on loan at Greek side Olympiacos, is desperate to impress Arsene Wenger after starring at the World Cup for Costa Rica.

And it seems the 22-year-old is intent on preparing himself for Premier League action by going to extremes after posting an image of himself taking a dip with team-mate-Alex Oxlade Chamberlain on Twitter.

Campbell, who is hoping to challenge Frenchman Olivier Giroud for a starting spot in Wenger's side, shared the picture following the Gunners' second day of pre-season training in Austria.

Oxlade-Chamberlain is also back and raring to go after a frustrating summer spent at the World Cup in Brazil.

The England midfielder was forced to sit and watch as his country crashed out in the group stage after injuring himself in a pre-tournament friendly with Honduras.

He missed Arsenal's weekend defeat to New York Red Bulls but looks likely to play some part when the Londoners host the Emirates Cup this weekend.

Wenger's men face Portuguese side Benfica on Saturday before taking on Monaco the following day.
