Remi Garde has spoken to Newcastle about the vacant manager’s job but wants to wait until the summer.

Chief executive Lee Charnley and chief scout Graham Carr met the former Arsenal player in London over the weekend to discuss replacing Alan Pardew.

Frenchman Garde, who is on a year’s sabbatical after stepping down from Lyon at the end of last season, remains one of several candidates. His situation is complicated by the fact his preferred backroom team are still under contract at Lyon.

Interim manager John Carver looks set to remain in charge, at least until Saturday’s visit of Southampton, while Newcastle consider their options.

Another Frenchman, Christophe Galtier, is also a target but insists he will not walk out on Saint-Etienne in the middle of the season.

Carver is willing to take the reins until the summer and would like to remain at the club whoever is appointed.

He has been backed by Jose Mourinho to get the job at St James’ Park. Carver said the Chelsea manager talked to him on the touchline, adding: ‘He said to me, “If you keep playing like this you’ll get a five-year contract as Newcastle manager”. It was nice.

‘At the end of the game he said, “You deserve the job, you’re ready for it now. I hope you get it.” We just laughed and he gave me another hug — he must have hugged me 10 times.’
