Tainted: DJ Jimmy Savile was the face of Top of the Pops for decades

The BBC has snubbed the 50th anniversary of Top of the Pops because the programme has been tainted by the Jimmy Savile scandal, it has been claimed.

The long-running series, which was on every week for 42 years and still appears in Christmas scheduling, was first broadcast on New Year's Day 1964, presented by Savile from a church in Manchester.

The DJ opened the show with the words 'It's number one, it's Top of the Pops'. The show played host to iconic acts over the years, from the Rolling Stones - the first band to play the show - to the Beatles, The Clash, Cliff Richard, the Bee Gees, David Bowie and Sir Elton John.

But, unlike Dr Who, which celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, Top of the Pops will receive no special programming at all.

The sci-fi series was honoured with a feature-length anniversary episode as well as a dramatised documentary about its creation.

But Top of the Pops, which at its 1970s peak was watched by a quarter of the country, has no anniversary TV or radio shows, and prompted only a trivia article on the BBC website.

The decision is thought to be a direct result of the scandal following Savile's death in 2011 aged 84.

Victim after victim came forward to reveal that the DJ had abused them when they were children. It is suspected he could have abused as many as 450 children.

He has since been branded Britain's worst ever paedophile.

Debut: Jimmy Savile appears on the first ever Top of the Pops, on New Year's Day 1964

Famous faces: Iconic artists, including The Beatles, shown in 1964, performed on Top of the Pops

Long-running: This picture, from 2011, shows Savile with former presenter Jamie Theakston

Continuing: Top of the Pops still appears in Christmas scheduling, such as the pictured episode, shown last night, which featured Tinie Tempah

BBC executives have previously axed 
programmes featuring Savile and has pledged never to show footage of the
 presenter in re-runs.

However, not everybody is pleased by the decision, which some say does the show a disservice by ignoring its contribution to music history.

Patrick Humphreys, who has written a book about the show's history for the anniversary, said: 'It’s upsetting because I think the show deserves to be remembered for what it was, the excitement it created and what it went on to become.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'Although there are both the Christmas and New Year’s Eve Top of The Pops specials, there are no current plans for a TOTP 50th anniversary programme.'

1. The programme was originally commissioned for six weeks, but ran for 42 years.2. The fee for the first ever Top of the Pops appearance - by the Rolling Stones - was £86.3. Sir Cliff Richard has performed on the show more than anybody else - an estimated 160 times.4. Pete Townshend, of The Who, admitted it was TOTP which prompted him into his famous 'windmill' style of playing the guitar.5. Status Quo are the group with the most TOTP appearances – 86 in total.6. Elton John’s first TOTP appearances were as a backing musician for Brotherhood Of Man and Pickettywitch in 1970.7. Although the show's theme tune was a version of Led Zeppelin track Whole Lotta Love, the band never actually appeared on TOTP.8. For nine months in 1971, the show featured an album slot.9. When Queen made their TOTP debut, Freddie Mercury didn't own a TV, so had to watch himself in a shop window.10. Punk band The Clash boycotted the show because they’d have to mime - but by 1991 it was compulsory to sing live
