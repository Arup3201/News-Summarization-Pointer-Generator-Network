Liz Cheney has taken a stance against same-sex marriage despite having a sister who is gay married.

Cheney’s sister Mary and longtime partner Heather Poe were legally married in Washington, DC in 2012 and even their former vice president father Dick Cheney supports his lesbian daughter’s right to marry.

But in her senate race bid in ultra-conservative Wyoming, Liz Cheney has become the black sheep in her family on the hot button issue.

‘I am not pro-gay marriage,’ Cheney said in a statement released by her campaign.

Cheney announced her run for senate against incumbent Republican Senator Mike Enzi last month.

Since then, she has accused the Enzi campaign of running ‘push poll,’ reports ABC News, one in which voters are asked ‘Are you aware that Liz Cheney supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage?’

The Enzi campaign has categorically denied the claims, but Cheney has now pushed back with her unequivocal declaration.

Departure: Even Liz's father Dick Cheney, seen here with Liz in 2011, supports gay marriage. 'My general view is freedom means freedom for everyone,' he said back in 2004

‘I believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states,’ the statement continued, ‘and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.’

This stance is also a slight departure for the candidate in regards to her high profile family.

Since as far back as 2004, Dick Cheney has maintained a pro-gay marriage stance.

‘Lynne and I have a gay daughter, so it’s an issue our family is very familiar with,’ Cheney told an audience that included his daughter while stumping in Iowa in 2004. ‘With the respect to the question of relationships, my general view is freedom means freedom for everyone. People ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to.’

Push back? Liz Cheney claims her opponent Mike Enzi is conducting a push poll campaign that asks voters 'Are you aware that Liz Cheney supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage?'

He later added that the issue should be decided on a state-by-state basis.

Liz Cheney attempted to turn the tables back on Enzi as her statement pushed past the abortion and gay marriage issues.

‘The people of Wyoming deserve an honest campaign,’ Cheney said. ‘They should not be subject to the kind of dirty tricks this push poll represents.’
