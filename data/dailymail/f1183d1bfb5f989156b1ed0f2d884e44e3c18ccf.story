Trendy teaching methods have abandoned the tradition of imparting knowledge to allow children to chat about what they find interesting, Michael Gove claimed today.

The Education Secretary attacked GCSE exam questions about why X-Factor guru Simon Cowell is rude and whether or not rapper Tinie Tempah likes eating kangaroo.

He also ridiculed history lessons using plasticine models to learn about Hitler, and dismissed group work as ‘children chatting to each other’, which he claimed had seen some schools told to remove chairs and table from classrooms.

Standards: Education Secretary Michael Gove said warned against the 'sidelining' of the teacher from the activity of learning

In a major speech in central London, the senior Conservative said the work of good teachers was under attack on four fronts.

He
 dismissed the idea that teaching is a ‘depressing and demotivating 
activity’ in decline and the claim that teaching cannot make ‘any real 
difference’.

He also claimed
 teachers are under attack from people who think they cannot be trusted 
and need outsiders ‘at every turn to monitor, police and approve their 
activities’.

But he saved some of his most outspoken criticism for the ‘sidelining of the teacher from the activity of learning’.

Mr Gove went on: ‘Allied to these 
teaching methods which have nothing to do with passing on knowledge 
there has also been an emphasis on teachers having to put their own 
learning aside so that work is 'relevant’ to the students.

‘This
 has resulted in the dumbing of educational material down to the level 
of the child – with GCSE English papers that ask students about Tinie 
Tempah, or Simon Cowell – rather than encouraging the child to thirst 
after the knowledge of the teacher.’

In an English language GCSE exam in 
2011, students were asked to read an extract from Cowell's autogibraphy 
and an article from Hello! magazine before asking answering questions 
about the media mogul.

The questions set by the WJEC/CBAC exam board, included: 'Simon Cowell admits he’s rude. What explanations does he give for his behaviour?'

In another test, set by the AQA exam 
board, pupils had to read an interview with rapper Tinie Tempah about 
his favourite food from The Guardian.

Asked to 'list four things you learn 
about Tinie Tempah from the article', markers were told to award points 
for answers including 'he works in the music business' and 'he didn't 
like eating kangaroo'.

Michael Gove gave a string of examples of what he called dumbing down in the classroom, including:

Re-enacting the battle of 
Hastings on a field with softballs

Spending three 
lessons making castles out of cardboard boxes

Making plasticine models 
to learn about Hitler

Recreating life on a slave
 ship by making pupils gather under their desks

A-Level English students drawing faces of literary 
characters on a paper plate

GCSE English papers that ask students about Tinie Tempah or Simon Cowell

Schools and nurseries told to remove tables and chairs from classrooms

Children not allowed to sit still for longer than one minute for every year of their age

Mr Gove called for teachers who ‘actively pass on knowledge’, instead of leaving children to their own devices.

‘Children
 naturally learn to talk; they do not naturally learn to read, or to 
play the violin, or to carry out long division,’ he said.

Mr Gove said: ‘It's the belief that 
education should not be an activity in which the teacher imparts 
knowledge to the child but a pursuit - by the child - of what it finds 
interesting.’

Educational thinkers have repeatedly 
argued that the importance of teaching should be downgraded, he claimed 
with classrooms reorganised to reduce the teacher’s central role.

‘All too often, we’ve seen an 
over-emphasis on group work – in practice, children chatting to each 
other - in the belief that is a more productive way to acquire knowledge
 than attending to an expert.

‘Some schools have been pressured to fit in with prevailing doctrines, even against their own instincts.

‘Some nurseries and schools in Kent, for example, reported to us that they were told to remove tables and chairs from their classrooms.’

Teachers were also told not to keep children sitting still for longer than one minute for every year of their lives, even if listening to a story.

Children could not be allowed to tidy up, or be asked to put their coats on, in case it interrupted ‘child-initiated play’, Mr Gove claimed.

Where teaching is marginalised, inappropriate fun activities are used in place of proper learning, the minister suggested.

He
 pointed to a string of examples collected by teacher Matthew Hunter, 
who uses a blog a series to chronicle ‘intellectually impoverished’ 
schools and the content of history lessons aimed at 11 to 16-year-olds.

Mr
 Gove said: ‘They included studying the battle of Hastings by 
re-enacting it on a field with softballs, spending three lessons making 
castles out of cardboard boxes, making plasticine models to represent 
Hitler’s main aims as Fuhrer and recreating life on a slave ship by 
making pupils gather under their desks.

‘Another
 teacher records a lesson for A-Level English students in which they 
were asked to depict literary characters on a paper plate – drawing a 
face on the plate - and then asked to use stickers to define the 
character’s principal traits - pinning the stickers on their clothes and
 mingling with other students, while they introduce themselves “in 
character”.'
