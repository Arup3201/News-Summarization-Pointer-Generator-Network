A South Carolina couple is suing the hotel where they say their wedding was ruined by a depraved man who stood above the ceremony flashing his genitalia.

Anna Rogers Murphy, along with her parents Clay and Carol, want City Market Hotels to pay up for the ruined nuptials at a Charleston DoubleTree Inn.

Not named as a defendant in the suit is Samuel James Dengal, the young Pennsylvania man who authorities say pressed his genitals against his hotel window after waving to guests and the bride and groom.

Flasher: Samuel James Dengel was arrested for indecent exposure after the lewd act at a DoubleTree hotel in Charleston, South Carolina. He is not named as a defendant

'Before the agreement was signed, defendant LLC assured plaintiffs that the courtyard would be an appropriate location for the wedding ceremony,' reads the complaint obtained by Courthouse News.

According to the complaint, the bride-to-be and her parents were concerned about intrusive hotel guests from the start.

They were assured by management 'that the ceremony would not be disrupted by hotel guests not in attendance,' court documents claim.

The family then paid the hotel $15,000, reassured that the event would be safe from any unwanted guests. It was anything but.

The mother-of-the-bride would later tell officers that she saw a naked man in the window of a hotel room overlooking the courtyard at the DoubleTree where the wedding party had gathered.

Officers said when they went to Dengel's hotel room, he answered the door wearing only a towel. He was in the room with a woman whose identity was not revealed.

He has a large tattoo, which he appeared to have been showing off to guests, when he flashed them during the celebration. According to philly.com, it reads: 'By the Power of Truth, I, while living, have Conquered the Universe.'

According to the suit, Dengel's act 'was so extreme and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as utterly atrocious and intolerable in a civilized community.'

The plaintiffs and her parents are seeking actual and punitive damages for negligence and emotional distress.
