Michelle Keegan has finally revealed her SS15 range for Lipsy in full and she shows off her summer body and tan in the imagery, which was shot on a sun-drenched beach

As the clothes horse shows, her new range is full of colourful print playsuits, cool crochet and lots of sophisticated lace.

Speaking to FEMAIL about her new drop, the actress, model and fashion designer said: 'One of my favourite parts of summer is being able to experiment with brand new styles and colours.

'It’s the easiest season to wear fresh statement brights and hot new prints. I also love soft earthy shades such as nude and taupe complemented by sun kissed skin.'

Michelle has taken inspiration from the catwalk, and included lots of the monochrome pieces she loves to wear herself to create a range of swimwear, beach cover-ups and nighttime apparel. 

The pint-sized star has been working hard in the design studio in between her acting gigs to make sure every piece in her range is spot on for summer

Her new range is full of beach attire, including cover-ups and brightly coloured bikinis

'I would wear everything in the collection,' Michelle said. 'There's dresses for the evening, beachwear for days by the pool, playsuits and girly tops. There's lots of colour because I love embracing it for summer and there's fun touches like poms poms to give it a festival vibe.

'Overall, it's feminine, fun and classic.'

In between planning her wedding, filming and attending glitzy showbiz events, Michelle ensured that she spent plenty of time in the design studio to perfect each and every item from her new range.

'I've been really busy but I made sure to keep an eye on catwalk trends to see what's going to be big, created mood boards and analysed shapes, colours and textures to get it right,' she said.

Letting us in on the secret behind her flawless, bare-face beauty,  the radiant star says she takes a less is more approach to make-up.

'Keep a fresh-faced feel. With day wear make-up, you can always add to it later in the evening. In the summer, I wear much less make-up and it looks better on your skin.'

Describing her latest drop for the high-street brand, she said: 'overall, it's feminine, fun and classic'

As well as clothes perfect for poolside posing, Michelle has designed clothes for hazy nights out, too

Her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin. She swears by Simple face wipes, Origins cleanser and Garnier and Kiehls moisturisers. 

The pint-sized star also emphasises the importance of exuding confidence. She said: 'If you’re feeling unsure about anything you’re wearing, ditch it. You’ll feel out of sorts all day if you don’t give your entire outfit a thumbs up.'

Bodywise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and whilst there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout.

'I try and go to the gym as much as I can,' she said. 'It could be three times a week or not at all one week, but I don't punish myself if I don't go.'

In summer, Michelle opts for a minimal beauty regime and says having a good moisturiser is an essential 

Sharing her fail-safe tip for pulling off a look, she said: 'My top tip for day wear glamour is: keep it simple, keep it comfortable and wear key pieces'

Michelle is looking forward to tying the knot to her Mark Wright, pictured together at The Sun Bizarre Party on Monday night, who previously revealed they are getting married in Norfolk later this year

Michelle has recently finished filming on her new TV show, Ordinary Lies, her first major role since quitting ITV soap Coronation Street.

The actress used to play Tina McIntyre on Corrie's cobbles but has switched allegiances to the BBC where she'll portray car showroom receptionist Tracy in the new six-part series.

As well as her career coup, Michelle is looking forward to tying the knot to her man, who previously revealed they are getting married in Norfolk later this year.
