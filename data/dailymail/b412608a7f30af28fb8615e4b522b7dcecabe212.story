The young woman who was crushed to 
death when a 13-feet high concrete window frame fell on her as she walked past was named this afternoon.

Shoppers watched in horror as Amanda Telfer was
fatally injured as she ate a banana while passing by a construction 
site on Hanover Square, off Oxford Street in central London last Thursday evening.

Poignant floral tributes were left for Ms Telfer, including one with a note saying 'sorry we couldn't save you', just metres from where the giant frame that killed her lay for several days.

Tragedy:
A police tent was put up where a window fell on top of Amanda Telfer as she passed by Hanover Square, just off
Oxford Street, in central London

She was pronounced dead on the pavement last Thursday evening despite attempts by an air ambulance, two cycle responders, two ambulance crews and members of the hazardous area response team to save her life.

The frame was so heavy that it took ten people to lift it off her, witnesses said.

Police are working alongside the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to try to establish what happened, while a post-mortem was carried out on Saturday.

The emergency call was made by a man delivering electrical cables to the area. He said that the woman was 'flattened', and that he thought he saw her 'draw her last breath'.

The 999 operator told him to get closer and probably saw the moment she died.

'Her eyes were open and I saw her hand move and then I think I saw her last breath and then the light went out: she'd gone,' he said.

'You'd have more chance of winning the lottery than that happening to you.

'She was in exactly the wrong place at the wrong time.'

Shock:
The accident happened as workmen were installing windows at a new 
multi-million pound six-storey office block. Ambulance crews rushed to 
the scene and battled to save the woman but she was declared dead

The construction company running the site, Westgreen Construction Ltd, said this morning they would do 'whatever is necessary' and called it a 'terrible accident.'

Witnesses claimed the ‘very
heavy’ window had been left ‘propped’ on a wall on the ground floor, 
and that  barriers guarding the building site had recently been removed.

The accident happened at 11.30am in 
Mayfair’s Hanover Square, which houses some of London’s most expensive 
offices. 

An art gallery is on the ground floor and the Vogue building, 
the headquarters of publisher Conde Nast, is opposite.

Dario Motti, 65, said the 12ft-high 
frame had been propped up against a wall before it fell on the woman. ‘I
saw the frames delivered,’ he added. ‘They were so heavy they
were lifted in by crane.’

Taped off: Police officers were stationed around the scene where a woman has died after she was struck by a falling window pane

Investigation: The Health and Safety Executive launched an investigation into the tragedy and shocked witnesses took to Twitter to express their horror and the freak accident which was caused by high winds

A man delivering electrical cables to another building, who did not want to be named, said that it had taken ten people to lift the frame off the woman

Kohei Matsumoto, manager of a nearby 
Itsu sushi restaurant, added: ‘Two of my team members saw a girl turn 
left into Hanover Street. She was eating a banana.

‘The next thing they saw was this 
window frame falling down on her. She didn’t scream – it happened so 
quickly.’ 

A man delivering electrical cables to another building,  who 
did not want to be named, said that it had taken ten people to lift the 
frame off  the woman.

‘I heard this incredible loud bang,’ 
he said. ‘I turned round and the frame was on the ground. I was hoping 
it was a coat underneath – but then I saw an arm.

‘There was a woman who said she was a doctor who wanted to perform CPR, and somebody was giving her mouth-to-mouth.

‘Her eyes were open and I saw her hand
move and then I saw her last breath, and then the light went out – 
she’d gone. She was in the wrong place at the wrong time.’

Building site: Workmen were installing windows in a six-storey office block in Hanover Square in London when the incident happened

Beverley Hazel, from Kennington, South London, was on her way to work at 11.30am when she saw the woman lying in the road.

She said: ‘She was very young and 
slight. I’ve got two daughters, one younger and one older than this 
woman. I was in bits. If it had been my daughter I would have wanted 
someone with her.’

A spokesman for Westgreen Construction
Ltd, of Richmond-upon-Thames, Surrey, which is managing the building 
project,  said: ‘We will do whatever is necessary. This is a terrible 
accident.’

The woman’s body, which had been covered by a yellow police tent, was removed by a private ambulance at 6.45pm.
