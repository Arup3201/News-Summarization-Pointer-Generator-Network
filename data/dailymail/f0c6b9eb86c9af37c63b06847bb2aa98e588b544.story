A Florida business forced its employees to take Scientology classes that involved 'screaming at ashtrays or staring at someone for eight hours without moving,' according to a federal investigation.

Dynamic Medical Services in Miami allegedly made Norma Rodriguez, Maykel Ruz, Rommy Sanchez,Â  Yanileydis Capote and other employees spend at least half their work days in Scientology courses and fired two staffers who refused.

According to an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint, filed May 8, Dynamic Medical, which provides medical and chiropractic treatment, required one employee, Sanchez, to undergo an 'audit' by connecting herself to an 'E-Meter' - a religious artifact in Scientology.

The government claims the company's owner, Dr. Dennis Nobbe, also required her to undergo 'purification' treatment at the Church of Scientology.

The company has labeled the accusations 'baseless' and told ABC News that it would vigorously defend itself against them, insisting it prides itself on the diversity of its staff.

But according to the complaint, employees repeatedly protested at having to attend Scientology classes however they were told it was a requirement of their job.

Two workers, Rodriguez and Sanchez, were terminated when they refused to participate in Scientology religious practices 'and/or did not conform to Scientology religious beliefs.'

Robert Weisberg, regional attorney for the EEOC's Miami office, slammed the company, labeling its actions a 'shameful' violation of federal law.

'Employees' freedom from religious coercion at the workplace must be protected,' he said. 'These actions are a shameful violation of federal law.'

The EEOC filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida after failing to reach a pre-litigation settlement with the company.

The government is seeking back pay for Rodriguez and Sanchez, compensatory and punitive damages for all named claimants who were 'subjected to a hostile work environment and disparate treatment.'

They are also after an injunctive relief ordering the company to stop requiring employee participation in courses involving religious practices.

The Church of Scientology did not respond to ABC's requests for comment.
