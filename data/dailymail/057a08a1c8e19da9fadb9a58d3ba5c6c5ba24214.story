When Atlanta immigration attorney Stacy Ehrisman-Mickle filed a request last month to delay a hearing that fell during her six-week maternity leave, she was certain the judge would grant it without hesitation, but she was in for a shocking surprise.

Earlier this month, Ehrisman-Mickle received an official letter form Judge J. Dan Pelletier Sr informing her that her adjournment request had been denied on the grounds that a maternity leave was not a good enough reason to postpone the hearing. 

With her truck driver husband working out of state and no nanny on hand, Mrs Ehrisman-Mickle was left with little choice but to strap her four-week-old baby daughter to her chest and trudge off to court.

But Ehrisman-Mickle said when she appeared before Judge Pelletier, he scolded her in front of a packed courtroom and questioned her parenting skills. 

Reached by phone Thursday, Pelletier said immigration judges can't make public comment and referred questions to the public affairs office of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the branch of the Department of Justice that oversees immigration courts. 

That office said in an email it couldn't comment on the judge's action and that a complaint had been filed and was being processed.

Ehrisman-Mickle's clients came to her in early July for a consultation, but they couldn't afford to hire her right away, she said. They went to their first immigration court hearing on September 2 without a lawyer and then came to Ehrisman-Mickle's office with their mother four days later to hire her.

Ehrisman-Mickle told them she would take their case but that their next hearing on October 7 fell during her maternity leave. 

Attorney at law: Ehrisman-Mickle took on a new case in September and filed a motion to delay a hearing scheduled for October 7 because it fell during her scheduled six-week maternity leave  

Shocker: The lawyer was certain the judge would sign off on the delay and was stunned to receive a rejection letter just days before her hearing 

She told them she'd have to file a motion to delay the hearing but that it shouldn't be a problem because two other immigration judges had already granted similar motions based on letters from her doctor, she said.

She filed the motion September 8 and it was received by the court the following day, she said.

Pelletier ruled on the motion October 2 and Ehrisman-Mickle's office received the decision the following day, the Friday before the Tuesday hearing, she said.

In the order denying her request, Pelletier wrote: 'No good cause. Hearing date set prior to counsel accepting representation.'

At home in bed, Ehrisman-Mickle was shocked when her secretary called to tell her the motion had been denied. Her husband, a retired US Marine working as a truck driver, was not home, her 4-week-old daughter was too young for day care and she has no family in Georgia, she said.

'I was in a state of panic. I didn't know what to do with my baby,' she told The Associated Press on Thursday.

New parents: Ehrisman-Mickle said her husband, a retired US Marine (pictured here on their wedding day) working as a truck driver, was out of state and could not watch their baby during her court appearance  

Humiliated: The new mother, pictured on her wedding day, said the judge questioned her parenting skills for exposing her newborn baby to germs in a packed courtroom 

She called her daughter's pediatrician to ask if it would be safe to bring the baby with her to court. The doctor told her it would be OK as long as she kept the infant in a carrier on her chest facing her body and didn't let anyone touch the baby.

During the hearing, her infant began to cry, and Judge Pelletier scolded her for inappropriate behavior and commented that her pediatrician must be appalled that she was exposing the baby to so many germs in court, she said.

'I was embarrassed. I felt humiliated,' she said.

Another lawyer who was present in the courtroom confirmed the details of Ehrisman-Mickle's story. He asked that his name not be used because he doesn't want the judge to retaliate against his clients.

Pelletier finally agreed to delay the hearing until after Ehrisman-Mickle is cleared by her doctor to return to work, she said.

Lawyer strikes back: Ehrisman-Mickle filed a complaint against Judge Pelletier, accusing him of discrimination

Ehrisman-Mickle said she filed a formal complaint against Pelletier the same day as the hearing. An investigating judge called to get her side of the story after the complaint was filed but she hasn't heard anything further, she said.

'He questioned the fact that day care centers do not accept infants less than 6 weeks of age,' the attorney wrote in her complaint, cited by the blog Above the Law. 'He then questioned my mothering skills as he commented how my pediatrician must be appalled that I am exposing my daughter to so many germs in court. He humiliated me in open court.'

Ehrisman-Mickle went on to accuse the judge of discriminating against her due to her 'condition,' calling such thinking 'absolutely reprehensible.'

'I am horrified that this occurred and that I had to bring my infant to court with me,' she stated, adding that child birth 'is not a minor inconvenience.'

'Furthermore, I am a qualified, experienced and ethical attorney that should not have to stop practicing law upon becoming pregnant to accommodate the backward thinking of certain judges,' the attorney concluded.

Georgia State University College of Law associate professor Tanya Washington said it was reasonable of Ehrisman-Mickle to believe the judge would delay the hearing to accommodate her maternity leave. 

Furthermore, Ehrisman-Mickle demonstrated a real commitment to her clients by showing up with her baby, Washington said.

'I think the judge yelling at her for being unprofessional by appearing with her child is unreasonable, insensitive and unprofessional,' Washington said.
