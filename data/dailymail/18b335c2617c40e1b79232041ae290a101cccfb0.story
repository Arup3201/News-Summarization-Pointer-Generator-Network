Manuel Pellegrini revealed he has set his sights on FA Cup glory this season in order to complete his full set of domestic honours in just his second season in charge at Manchester City.

Victory in the competition would allow the Chilean to join an exclusive club with his great rival Jose Mourinho as the only two managers from outside these shores to have won the famous old trophy, the Premier League and the Capital One Cup.

But Pellegrini played down talk of following in the footsteps of the Chelsea boss, insisting instead he has a burning desire to take home the missing FA Cup winners medal to make up for their disappointing exit at the hands of Wigan last season in a re-run of the previous year's final.

'It is an important motivation,' he said. 'Last year I was not concerned because it is very difficult to win all the competitions.

'If you remember we had three games postponed and if we had continued in the FA Cup last year then we would have had four of five games postponed and it would have been very difficult to play all the games in the last month if you want to win the title.

'This year we do not have the Capital One so I hope we continue as far as we can in the FA Cup and continue to fight for the title in the Premier League.'

His side face the same Sheffield Wednesday side they thrashed 7-0 earlier on in the season, but Pellegrini warned his side of complacency when they meet at the Etihad on Sunday.

He added: 'The 7-0 result was a lie because the first half was a very close game. I cannot remember exactly but I think we did not score the first goal until the fifth or sixth minute of the second half.

'We will be making a great mistake if we were to think it would be easy because of the last game we played against them.'

Injuries to Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero mean Stevan Jovetic is likely to get an extended run in the team over the next few weeks.

The 25-year-old has been struggling with injuries since his £22m move from Italy in the summer of 2013, but the Montenegro striker insists he is winning his fitness battle and now the Manchester City fans will finally get to see the best of him.

'We have some injuries and I have got a chance to play from the start,' he said. 'It has been hard for me in the last 18 months because unfortunately I have had some problems with injuries and my fitness.

'I don't think I have a big problem. I would say that I have just been unlucky.

'I feel better now, much better than last year, and I think I will get better. The City fans have not seen the best of me. Nowhere near.

'I just want to stay healthy now. It I can do that then I can promise them that I am a much better player than they have seen so far.'
