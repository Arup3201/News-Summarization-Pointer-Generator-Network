Beleaguered NSW Liberal MPs Tim Owen and Dr Andrew Cornwell have resigned from parliament as of this afternoon.

It comes after another day of high drama at the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) where Mr Owen admitted lying to the corruption watchdog about returning a wad of $100 notes worth about $10,000 that he received in a car from property developer Jeff McCloy.

Mr Owen told ICACÂ on Monday that either his campaign manager Hugh Thomson or former NSW police minister Mike Gallacher arranged the December 2010 deal.

But in sensational evidence today at the hearing into Liberal Party funding and breaches of the electoral donation funding act in Sydney, he said the money was never given back but 'rolled into (his) campaign'.

Mr Owen and current Newcastle mayor, Mr McCloy, agreed on Sunday that Mr Owen would tell ICAC he was given about $2,000 by the Newcastle mayor but returned it the next day.

Quoting Mr Owen's evidence from Monday, Mr McCloy's lawyer asked 'if the words that follow... "and then I went back to his house after that and basically dropped the envelope back in his letter box", were false.'

'Yes. It was," the former the deputy commander of the Australian forces in Afghanistan and Iraq said.

'You said 'I think I just put a little note on it that said no thanks', that answer was false,' Mr McCloy's lawyer pressed.

'Correct,' Mr Owen said.

During the Sunday meeting the men also discussed whether Mr McCloy should resign as Lord Mayor of Newcastle, the ICAC heard.

Mr Owen denied he was asked by Mr McCloy to come clean about the cash.

'You said 'my wife will divorce me. I've sworn on a stack of bibles that I didn't receive any money",' Mr McCloy's lawyer said.

'I didn't say that to him, no,' Mr Owen said.

Mr Owen says he tried to make the statement on Monday afternoon but was cut off by counsel assisting the commission, Geoffrey Watson.

A formal announcement on the parliamentary future of both Mr Owen and Dr Cornwell is expected later today.

Both had already quit the Liberal Party and have now ended their terms in parliament prematurely, likely forcing Premier Mike Baird into by-elections for the seats of Charlestown and Newcastle.

A general election is due to be held in March of next year.
