Harvard University, in the north-east of the U.S., is one of the world's best - but Havard School, in Milton Keynes, is rather less prestigious.

Now the great American university is suing Havard, a small private business and technology school, claiming that the British institution's similar name is a violation of its trademark.

Although the two colleges are 3,200 miles apart from each other, and at the opposite ends of the reputation scale, Harvard insists that Havard is threatening its reputation.

Havard: This business school in Milton Keynes is not to be confused with the similarly named Harvard

Contrast: Harvard, in Massachusetts, is renowned as one of the best universities in the world

In a hearing at the High Court in London, a lawyer for Harvard argued that there was 'evidence of confusion' between the two institutions despite their differences.

'This is a claim for trademark infringement of Harvard University's UK and Community trademarks for the word Harvard,' she said.

The management of Havard School 'contend that its acts do not constitute trademark infringement' and have issued a counter-claim, the lawyer added.

Mr Justice Roth set a date for the full hearing of the case in February, saying that it remained to be decided 'whether Harvard has suffered any loss or damage' from the activities of Havard School.

Harvard, established in 1636 in 
Cambridge, Massachusetts, boasts eight U.S. presidents including Barack 
Obama among its alumni, and was this year ranked the world's second best
university.

Havard 
School of Management and Technology UK Ltd offers diplomas in subjects 
such as IT, Law, Tourism Management and 'Bible Studies & 
Leadership'.

On its website, it describes Milton Keynes as 'a very lovely and peaceful city located on the outskirts of London' notable for its 'posh and aesthetic beauty'.

The school, which calls itself 'the seat of wisdom', tells prospective students: 'Once you have arrived in UK and assuming you came via the Heathrow Airport and have been cleared by the UK Immigration Clearing Officer, the rest is easy, make inquiry from Airport Officials on how to get your way to Milton Keynes [sic].'

The website adds: 'Milton Keynes 
provides an amazingly wealthy source of knowledge and entertainment with
all the attractions and facilities of a flourishing modern city.

'Once
in the Milton Keynes, you will never wish to relocate to other cities 
in the UK for any reason, hence Milton Keynes is said to be the 
heartbeat of responsible young-stars and good spirited individuals' home
of attraction. It is now the new exciting and vibrant city mostly sort 
after [sic].'

Describing
the learning facilities available at Havard School, the website adds: 
'The good news is that the Milton Keynes Library is just a stone's throw
to HAVARD SCHOOL UK, right at the heart of the City.'

Alongside
a picture of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, the website also 
proclaims: 'Havard School UK the home of Legends and Champions - be 
there'.

Fees for most of the school's courses run to £3,500 per year for British students and £5,500 for foreigners.
