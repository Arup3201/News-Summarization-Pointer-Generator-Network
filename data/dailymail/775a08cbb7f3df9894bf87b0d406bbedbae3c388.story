Vindicated: Michael Woodford was sacked for raising concerns about fraud at Olympus, which has now admitted to hiding £1 billion losses on securities investments

The British ex-boss of Olympus - fired after just two weeks for raising concerns about fraud at the firm - has today been vindicated after the Japanese camera company admitted to hiding £1 billion losses on securities investments.

Michael Woodford, 51, was sacked on October 14 for questioning the firm's 2007 £1bn takeover of Reading-based medical equipment firm Gyrus and the purchase of three other smaller companies.

He had only been made its CEO at the start of the month - after 30 years working for the company which saw him rise to become head of its European operations.

Olympus said the axing of its first ever foreign president and chief operating officer was because he 'failed to understand the company's management style or Japanese culture'.

But he maintained it was because he had uncovered a series of questionable payments, and then campaigned for the company to come clean.

And today Olympus admitted to fraud, dating back to the 1980s, after bowing to mounting pressure to explain a series of baffling transactions that have put the future of the firm in doubt.

With the news, Woodford called for the Olympus board to resign, and said he would like to return to manage the company should shareholders wish to reinstate him.

A subdued Olympus President Shuichi Takayama, who staunchly defended the deals when he took over from Tsuyoshi Kikukawa last month, told a press conference: 'I was absolutely unaware of the facts I am now explaining to you. The previous presentations were mistaken.'

He blamed his predecessor Kikukawa, who quit as president and chairman on October 26, Vice-President Hisashi Mori and internal auditor Hideo Yamada for the cover-up.

And he revealed he was now considering initiating criminal complaints against them.

He said Olympus had discovered funds relating to its purchase of Gyrus, which involved a huge advisory fee of £427 million as well as payment of £480 million for three tiny domestic firms, were used to hide losses on the securities investments.

The investment in the three domestic firms was largely written off a few months after the deals closed.

It means Olympus, its directors and accountants are now open to possible criminal charges for suspected accounting fraud and shareholder suits.

Ryosuke Okazaki, chief investment officer at ITC Investment Partners, said: 'This is very serious. Olympus admitted it has made false entries to cover its losses for 20 years.

'All people involved in this over 20 years would be responsible. There is a serious danger that Olympus shares will be de-listed. The future of the company is extremely dark.'

Olympus' announcement sent its shares tumbling 29 per cent to a 16-year low.

The company has lost a staggering 70 per cent of its value, or $6 billion, since it fired Woodford, who had been one of the few foreign CEOs of a Japanese blue chip company.

Olympus said it discovered the cover-up while working with an independent panel set up last week to investigate the deals. Kikukawa and Mori confessed to their roles on Monday night, Takayama said.

Mori was sacked earlier in the day while the internal auditor offered to resign. Olympus said it would decide whether others were responsible after further investigation.

The independent panel's head, retired Supreme Court justice Tatsuo Kainaka, said his team may recommend criminal charges in its report, which will be completed early next month.

Takayama said he believed the loss-postponement scheme had started before the 1990s.

The firm said it had funnelled money related to the acquisitions through various funds and other measures to defer posting the unspecified losses, similar to practices seen after Japan's bubble economy of soaring asset prices burst in 1990.

While Olympus did not offer concrete details, Takayama said he believed the company may have initiated the loss-postponing scheme when its earnings had taken a drastic turn for the worse, possibly during a period of yen strength.

Such a scheme may have involved creating a fund or special purpose vehicle to buy battered securities at book value, getting them off Olympus' balance sheet. The cost to fund that scheme would have ballooned over time.

Nippon Life Insurance, the biggest shareholder in Olympus, urged the company to be more transparent in its explanations.

Keiji Isaji, an attorney with K&L Gates law firm in Tokyo, said: 'The members of the board appear to have breached their fiduciary duty owed to the company and to the shareholders.'

And a spokesman for the Tokyo Stock Exchange said the bourse needed more information before deciding whether to put Olympus shares under supervision, a step towards possible de-listing.

He added that Olympus needed to examine the size of the deferred losses and whether they had an impact on shareholder investment decisions before taking further action.

Lawyers said if Olympus had knowingly falsified its consolidated financial statements that were deemed material in nature, its representatives could face up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to 10 million yen.

Legal experts also said outside auditors might be criminally liable. Olympus replaced its auditor, KPMG, in 2009 after a disagreement over how to account for the controversial acquisitions.

In a confidential internal document obtained by Reuters, Kikukawa, the firm's then president, wrote to Olympus executives in the U.S. and Europe, revealing there had been a disagreement with KPMG which he did not plan to disclose to the stock market.

In May 2009, Kikukawa announced the contract with KPMG had ended and that another global accounting firm, Ernst & Young, would take over. Ernst & Young said it had no comment on the Olympus disclosure.
