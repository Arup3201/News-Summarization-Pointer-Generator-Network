Taulupe Faletau believes winning the RBS 6 Nations title this year would top Wales' comeback triumph of 2013.

Two years ago Wales became the first team to win the championship after losing their first game and history could repeat itself should Warren Gatland's side overcome Grand Slam-chasing Ireland at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday.

Wales lost their first game of the 2015 championship to England in Cardiff but back-to-back wins in Scotland and France have put them back into title contention.

Taulupe Faletau takes on the French defence during his side's victory in Paris in round three 

'2013 was great and the win against England at the end was probably the most satisfying I've had,' said British and Irish Lions number eight Faletau.

'To lose the first game in 2013 [to Ireland] and to have people on your backs and knocking you down... then to come back from that as a team was great.

'When the final whistle went against England it was amazing, but if we could replicate that it would probably be even better.

'Just doing it again I think would make it better.'

Wales' title hopes seemed a distant dream when England recovered from a first-half deficit in the tournament opener to run out 21-16 winners.

But successive wins on the road in Edinburgh and Paris have lifted Welsh spirits before confronting impressive Irish opponents who have already recorded victories over Italy, France and England.

'The boys put a good shift in and we got the result we wanted in Paris,' Faletau said of last weekend's Stade de France success.

'It was a good day at the office for the pack and the platform we had at the scrum, especially for me, was noticeable.

'It's what we want going forward and the longer we spend together the more we seem to get better.

'Hopefully we can build on last weekend and keep our tournament alive.'

Faletau seems set to lock horns again with his old Lions team-mate Jamie Heaslip as the Ireland number eight is on course to make a dramatic return from injury.

Heaslip cracked three vertebrae when he was kneed in the back by France lock Pascal Pape in Dublin last month, but Faletau believes Ireland will do everything in their power to have the Leinster man available at the Millennium Stadium.

'He's a great guy and a great player who's made a name for himself for many years now,' Faletau said.

'He's an important player for Ireland and one of their leaders, so if we stop his game maybe it will slow the rest down.

'But there's another 14 players you've got to stop as well and Ireland are definitely favourites.

'They had a really good autumn series beating Australia and South Africa and they're on fire at the moment.

'They having lost for 10 games but we've just got to do our job, do all the work on the training field and hopefully that will translate onto the pitch.'
