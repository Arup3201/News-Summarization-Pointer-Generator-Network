With her slender figure and dedication to the alkaline-based diet, the chances of catching Victoria Beckham eating a fish finger are pretty slim (excuse the pun).

However, Alison
 Jackson, best known for her 'spoof' productions of celebrities and 
royals, has been at it again, this time imagining what some of the biggest names in football will be doing this summer around the World Cup.

Alison has teamed up with Birds Eye and some uncanny impersonators to lift the lid on what she thinks goes on behind closed doors at Beckingham Palace, as well as the antics of Chelsea and 
former England Player John Terry and world-renowned manager Sven-Goran 
Eriksson.

Surely not? To celebrate the World Cup, spoof photographer Alison Jackson has called on the best David and Victoria Beckham lookalikes in the business to imagine what they may be doing this June and July

David Beckham is captured in his infamous white pants, similar to the ones he designs for H&M, preparing a half-time snack for himself and Victoria.

Victoria can be seen wearing her trademark oversized sunglasses, figure-skimming dress and sky-high stilettos as she tucks into the snack.

As if! Alison Jackson believes that David waltzes around the house in his skimpy pants and pink fluffy oven gloves, while Victoria is partial to a fish finger sandwich

Nice tats! Alison has even recreated David's famous tattoos on her male lookalike in her spoof World Cup shoot

Sven-Göran Eriksson is seen enjoying a fish finger sandwich in front of the game surrounded by Samba dancers, while John Terry shows his support by singing the national anthem from his living room.

Alison, who captures the snaps to make it appear that they were taken on an intruders mobile phone, most recently mocked up dozens of photos which show 
what she though newlyweds Kim and Kanye  might get up to on their honeymoon.

She also creates hilarious spoof Royal snaps, most recently showing a Prince William impersonator scrubbing up Prince George in a bubble bath.

Missing the beautiful game? John Terry can be seen weeping in his lounge as he sings the national anthem with his England kit on

Emotional: The Chelsea and former England Player looks overcome with emotion as he watches his former team take to the pitch for their big game

Party time: World-renowned manager Sven-Göran Eriksson is seen enjoying the game surrounded by Samba dancers in the spoof shot
