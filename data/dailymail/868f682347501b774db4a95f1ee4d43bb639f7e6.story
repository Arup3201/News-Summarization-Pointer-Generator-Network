A devoted husband whose wife has been convicted of trying to murder him said today: 'I still love her and always will'.

Christine Houston, 66, used a cravat to throttle her disabled partner Stewart, 56, and only failed to kill him because a Sainsbury's driver arrived to deliver their weekly shop.

Afterwards she told police she 'didn't have a 
gun and didn't like knives so strangling was all she could think of', Newcastle Crown Court heard.

Heartbroken: Stewart Houston was strangled by his mentally-ill wife Christine at home but he says he will always love her and she should never be blamed for what happened to him

Happier time: Mr and Mrs Houston have been married for 28 years - pictured in 2010 - but her conviction for attempted murder, which he never supported, means that she will never be allowed home again

But Mr Houston said today his full-time carer wife was 'failed' by the NHS who released her from a secure unit on two separate occasions despite her telling staff she wanted to 'suffocate him'.

'They kept this from me and sent her home to care for me 24 hours a day. She was failed by them. There is no chance she should have come home,' he told MailOnline.

Mrs Houston has admitted attempted murder and yesterday was told at Newcastle Crown Court she would be detained indefinitely in a mental hospital. 

The heartbroken couple, who are still 'devoted' to each other, shared a hug afterwards before she was taken away to custody. They will never be allowed to be together without supervision.

Mr Houston said: 'She is a loving, caring person. She is as gentle as a lamb.

‘I still love her and always will. She has cared for me selflessly for many years and made huge sacrifices in her life.

‘She
 was badly let down by people who should have cared for her. I believe 
that none of this would ever have happened had she been kept in.

‘We speak on the phone four to five times a day and I see her around four times a week.

‘It
 is sad because she will never be allowed to come home again and we will
 never be able to spend time together without supervision’.

Attempted murder: Christine Houston, left, was 
interrupted while trying to murder her husband Stewart, right, both outside court, by the 
arrival of a shopping delivery. Mr Houston says she 
shouldn't have been prosecuted

Saved: Mrs Houston was in the process of trying to kill her husband when their shopping from Sainsbury's arrived (file picture). Afterwards she carried on as if nothing had happened, her husband said

Mr Houston, who suffers from muscular 
dystrophy and is wheelchair bound, was left with blood spotting behind 
his eyes and marks to his neck as a result of her attack on May 26 last year.

The attack only stopped when a Sainsbury's shopping delivery arrived and interrupted them.

But he says she should never have been prosecuted for trying to kill him.

'I was sitting in my wheelchair when Christine came up from behind me and put the cravat round my neck,' Mr Houston said.

Bereft: Mr Houston has described how his wife Christine came from behind and throttled him with his cravat having repeatedly told professionals she wanted to harm him

‘It went on for at least ten minutes or more. She did not say anything at all during it. When I could I asked her to stop. I was very scared. 

‘It
 was a terrible situation to be in. I did not want my life to end. But I
 was also scared for Christine because if she managed to kill me I 
thought one day she would realise what she had done and try to harm 
herself.

‘Then the food delivery arrived and she stopped, shut the 
door and took in the food. He knew nothing about it at all. She came back and it was as if nothing had happened’.

Shortly
 after taking him to the toilet she called the police. She told them: ‘I
 have tried to kill my husband and I am a horrible person’.

Mr Houston blames the NHS for what happened, claiming the people who cared for her in a County Durham knew she wanted to hurt him and failed to tell him each time she was released.

He also says that social services failed to offer him enough care, meaning his unwell wife was expected to look after him round the clock despite having severe mental health problems.

Mrs Houston has bipolar and 'psychotic episodes' meaning she can have hallucinations.

Wedding day: Stewart and Christine met in 1984 and then married in September 1985. But as his health deteriorated his pharmacist wife was forced to give up work and care for him full time

Troubled: Mrs Houston had suffered from mental health problems from her early twenties but 'psychotic' episodes she suffered became worse in recent years, leading to her being taken into hospital on several occasions (pictured in 2004)

The couple, who are devout Christians, have been married for 28 years and met through church in Chester-le-Street.

- Stewart Houston, whose wife Christine tried to kill him

Mr Houston says the authorities maintained she was not a risk because she had not made any 'direct threat to kill', he claims.

Mr Houston said days before she strangled him: ‘she wrapped a pipe round my neck for three seconds and told me: "You realise how bad I am" but then she stopped'.

The attempted murder has been linked 
to 'carer's fatigue', where a person snaps through the pressures of 
looking after a loved one.

Christine's husband says she was put under incredible pressure to look after him.

He
 said after she tried to kill him he was left to look after himself from
 1pm to 10pm each day, and social workers would leave glasses of water 
around the house with long straws in them so he could stay hydrated.

Mr
 Houston then spent three months in hospital after failing to care for 
himself. It was only in November 2012 when he was given a 24-hour help 
at home.

Tragic: Mr Houston's wife was taken away from their County Durham home by police in May 2012 and told them: 'I tried to kill him, I wanted him dead'

Contact: The couple will never be able to spend time alone again and they speak on the phone at least five times a day

Sentencing: Mrs Houston was told yesterday she would be detained indefinitely in a mental hospital at Newcastle Crown Court yesterday

A spokesperson for Tees, Esk and Wear 
Valleys NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We appreciate how distressing this 
must be and we are sorry that Mr Houston has concerns about his wife’s 
care.  We would encourage him to get in touch with us so we can look 
into his concerns.'

Lesley 
Jeavons, head of adult care with Durham County Council, said: 'We will 
not go into detail about individual cases but can confirm we have not 
received any complaints from Mr Houston about the care package he 
receives. We will be contacting him to find out the details of his 
complaint and how he wishes to resolve matters. We take all complaints 
very seriously'.

Mr Houston has said he he hopes to launch legal action against both authorities and the county council because he blames them for what has happened to his wife.

'I am not able to get legal aid and do not have much money so fear I may not be able to', Mr Houston said.
