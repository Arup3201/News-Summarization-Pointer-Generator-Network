Author: Paul Torday, pictured at his home in Northumberland. He has died aged 67

Businessman-turned-writer Paul Torday, whose novel Salmon Fishing in the Yemen was made into a hit film, has died aged 67.

His publishers said the writer, who spent 20 years running an engineering business in his native North East, died yesterday afternoon.

Mr Torday was 61 when he published the book that made his name.

It sold more than half-a-million copies and was made into a film in 2011 starring Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt.

Kirsty Dunseath, Publishing Director at Weidenfeld and Nicolson Fiction, said: 'In many ways Paul Torday invented his own genre - his extraordinary fiction was filled with warmth and a wry, humane wit.

'He was a gentle observer of the foibles of human nature and our social behaviour.

'He wanted to entertain but his novels were also infused with a deep social awareness, exploring issues such as political expediency, alcoholism, mental illness, class and our national heritage.

'He was a very gentle man, thoughtful and considered in everything he did and it was a privilege and a joy to have worked with him.'

He was born in Croxdale, County Durham, in 1946 and went to the Royal 
Grammar School in Newcastle. He then won a scholarship to study English 
at Pembroke College, Oxford, and then on to a business course in 
Manchester.

After a couple of short-term jobs, he joined the family business Torday and Carlisle.

The Guardian reports he started his writing career when he won a national poetry competition sponsored by the Daily Mail at the age of 16 and the prize paid for his first foreign holiday.

He kept on writing poetry for a magazine for the next ten years and even wrote two novels in his 20s but he did not try to publish them.

The Independent has revealed the author had been diagnosed with cancer just before his most famous novel was published. He went on to produce a book a year but sadly died before finishing an eighth book.

He died at home in Northumberland and leaves his wife Penelope, ex- wife Jane, sons Piers and Nicholas and stepsons Jonathan and Charles.
