Radcu Prutianu, pictured, stole £30,000 of designer goods from Boots on Oxford Street on his first night renovating the flagship London store

A builder helped himself to £30,000 of designer goods on his first shift when he was hired to renovate Boots on Oxford Street.

Raducu Prutianu, 35, even stole steel partitions to sell for scrap metal, Southwark Crown Court heard.

The court heard that Prutianu arrived in the UK five years ago from Romania with his wife and two daughters, turning to crime because he was 'at a low ebb'.

But the judge Recorder Robert Rhodes QC, was unimpressed and jailed him for two years.

He said: 'This was a substantial theft in breach of trust.

'It was the first night that you were working and had no direct relationship with the victim, in this case Boots.

'It was clear that you had carried out two trips - first to take the steel partitions and then stealing spectacles and aftershave valued at over £30,000.

'You were trusted by your employer to work that evening and you breached their trust deliberately.'

Prutianu also has convictions for fraud after he conned tourists with street gambling games.

On previous occasions he was given community orders and suspended sentences that he breached numerous times.

Prutianu from Welling, Kent, pleaded guilty to a single count of theft.
