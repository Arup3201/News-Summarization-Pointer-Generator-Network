The former FEMA director who resigned after being widely criticized for the government’s slow response to Hurricane Katrina has now spoken out against President Obama for acting so quickly to Hurricane Sandy.

‘One thing (President Obama’s) gonna be asked is, why did he jump on (Hurricane Sandy) so quickly and go back to D.C. so quickly when (after) Benghazi, he went to Las Vegas? Why was this so quick? ... At some point, somebody's going to ask that question,’ Michael Brown told Denver Westword.

Brown is notorious for heading up the federal relief agency throughout their slow response to one of the country’s deadliest hurricanes.

Then-President George W Bush put 
‘Brownie’ squarely in the spotlight when he praised the work he was 
doing in the crisis, saying that he was doing a ‘heckuva job’.

Brown was skewered for appearing uncaring and insensitive when the Hurricane hit.

Some
 of the most damning evidence came when one of his emails from the day 
of the Hurricane became public. He wrote: ‘Can I quit now? Can I come 
home?’

As a result, Brown’s criticism is particularly surprising because President Obama has been widely praised for the speedy federal response to Sandy.

While the hypocrisy of Brown questioning Obama’s speed in response to a hurricane is absurd, it is not the first time that the Obama administration’s awkward reaction to the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, last month has been in the spotlight.

Many pundits speculated that the presidential campaign may take priority in the aftermath of the hurricane, as he did not cancel a campaign event in the swing state of Florida until the last very minute.

He did eventually cancel the event and has since scheduled a tour of some of New Jersey’s most devastated areas with the state’s governor.

Governor Chris Christie, an outspoken Republican and supporter of Obama’s presidential rival Mitt Romney, has lavished praise on the President over the past two days.

‘The president has been outstanding in this and so have the folks at FEMA,’ Christie told the Today Show on Tuesday.

Christie later told news anchor Soledad O’Brien, who famously held Brown accountable during an interview four days after Katrina hit, that Obama ‘has been incredibly supportive and helpful to our state, and not once did he bring up the election.’
