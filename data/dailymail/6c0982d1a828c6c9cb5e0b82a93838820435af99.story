Opulent to the extreme, the lavish estate of the Ukraine's ex-prosecutor-general Viktor Pshonka is another example of the extravagant homes the country's former leaders and top officials enjoyed living in.

With Pshonka reportedly having fled the country, the photos show the exterior and interior of the home, in the village of Gorenichy outside the capital Kiev, taken on Monday. A Reuters photographer said that with Pshonka gone, journalists and people entered the house to inspect it.

Zik reported that along with fugitive former president's Viktor Yanukovich's estate, the properties were having their value assessed by experts in the wake of them going on the run. 

This was only one of Pshonka's homes. He also had the use of a hunting lodge around 20 miles away on a compound with two other lodges, one of them for the use of the deposed president Viktor Yanukovych.

The hunting estate has been entered by opposition activists, who found guns and removed files, reported www.kyivpost.com. But there was no sign of Pshonka, who is seen as one of the key allies of Yanukovych.

Like Yanukovych, he is now on the run and his whereabouts are unclear. He may have left the country and is subject to an arrest warrant issued by the new authorities.

The scale of the opulence of homes used by public officials is seen by opposition activists as proof of large-scale corruption among the country's elite, one of the key causes of public anger which led to the protests in Kiev and other cities.

At the weekend, hundreds of people poured through the doors of Yanukovich's sprawling winter residence in Mezhyhirya, an hour's drive from Kiev, to gawp at its gaudy wonders.

Today it was the turn of Pshonka's house, a treasure trove filled with hundreds of jewelry pieces, arms collections, religious books, old icons and pictures.

Former ex-prosecutor-general Viktor Pshonka held the position from November 4, 2010 until February 22, 2014, when he was ousted  by the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukraine parliament, in a no-confidence vote. On February 23 an arrest warrant was issued for Pshonka.

Behind by a fort-like gate (pictured below), Pshonka's home awaits sprawling gardens and manicured grass. But the real extravaganza is in the house.

It features an indoor swimming pool, plush dinning rooms, grand fire places and is littered with ornate valuables and artwork including many portraits of himself.

The house's owner, former prosecutor-general Viktor Pshonka. Before he fled, Pshonka was a key member of the government. He was responsible for the oversight of a series of agencies which opposition groups said were used to repress those who opposed president Vyktor Yanukovych, including the country's presidents. He is pictured here at a press conference in May 2012 in Kiev, where he denied that the jailed opposition leader Yulia Tyhmoshenko had been beaten by prison guards. She is now free and a contender to become the next president

Grandeur: Each room features deluxe detailing, with this room crowned with a giant chandelier and two statuettes standing in front of luxurious drapes. Like much of the house, there is also religious art, with a painting of a Madonna and Child on the left of the picture

The picture below shows him greeting Orthodox priests. Ukraine is majority Orthodox and the backing of the faith's leaders is seen as one of the keys to political power

A range of religious articles and images are among the extensive catalogue of valuables in the home. The icons and other devotional art reflect not just the missing former prosecutor-general's taste, but the importance his government placed on identifying with the Orthodox faith. Kiev is the spiritual capital of the Russian Orthodox church, even though it is not now part of Russia. The conversion of Russia to Christianity began there and spread towards modern-day Moscow and eventually throughout modern-day Russia
