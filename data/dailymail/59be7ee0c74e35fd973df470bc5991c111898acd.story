Arm wars: Joanne Berberich (right) competing against Emma Phil of Sweden where she won 6-0

Joanne Berberich might look like your average 21-year-old but the petite mother of one has muscled her way to an astonishing world title - in arm wrestling!

Despite her five foot six inch frame, she regularly wipes the floor with burly blokes who naively challenge her to battle.

Joanne's gruelling training schedule involves four hours-a-day of running and weight lifting more than three stone to keep her in tip-top arm wrestling condition.

She took the crown after winning all but one of her ten matches at the World Arm Wrestling Federation Championships in Poland.

She said: 'It was absolutely crazy.

'I
 had competed the day before with my right arm which really isn't my 
favourite and I only came fifth, but the next day I got up early, had a 
really good breakfast and felt better and went on to win with my left.

'It was a bit nerve racking because the girl I had to beat in the final was the first match I had and she beat me.

'I
 like to win with power rather than technique because I like to use 
strength and if I've won that way it means I'm stronger than you.'

After
 a day of facing opponents from Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and Kazakhstan, 
she won first place in the lightweight category for women aged 21 and 
under.

She lost 
two-and-a-half stone in just six weeks to make the weight requirement of
 under 70 kilos - around 11 stone - for the competition.

She
 survived on a diet of chicken for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and 
endured a five hour sauna before her weigh in to lose a few extra 
pounds.

Wrestling is in the family for Joanne, whose dad Richard won silver place in the heavyweight category of the 1992 world championships.

Her husband Kevin, 41, is also a world-class wrestler and Joanne splits her time between Slough, 
and Kevin's native Germany.

The couple, who have a
 15-month-old son, Jacob, met in 2007 at the International Championships in Belgium and married in March.

Modest Joanne says she tries to shy away from competing with unsuspecting blokes - but doesn't mind beating them if they insist on a fight.

'I tend to keep it quiet but when people find out what I do you can imagine the reaction I get - people are always saying 'come on then I'll have a go',' she said.

'But I always beat them.'
