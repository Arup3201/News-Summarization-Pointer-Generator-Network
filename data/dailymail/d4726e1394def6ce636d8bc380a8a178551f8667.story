If only all of us could relax this much while on the job.

Roxy the chilled out French mastiff goes everywhere with her owner Nick Morris, 46, from Beckton, East London, joining him on his daily courier service.

The beautiful dog is so used to her daily routine in the passenger seat, she now settles right in, resting her crossed paws on the edge of the window.

Top dog: Roxy the French mastiff goes everywhere with her owner and has become totally content with her courier service routine

She's become so laid back as Mr Morris's driving companion that people stop and laugh and take pictures of the adorable two-year-old pup.

The friendly side-kick never leaves her owner's side and has become a minor celebrity in and around central London.

Pictured on swanky Bond street, passers by take photos of themselves with the Roxy, who always plays up to the cameras, Mr Morris said.

'I have queues and queues of people taking pictures of her - the most I have counted is 40 people.'

'As soon as she sees the flashes she will put her arm on the side of the van and sit there like a person,' he said.

There are few places Nick Morris, pictured in the background, goes without his adorable, chilled out mastiff

The reason Mr Morris is never seen without his beloved Roxy is because his wife wanted the dog out of the house because of his slobber

'If I pull up and open the window there will always be a queue there regardless.'

Roxy and Mr Morris are inseparable because of a long-standing problem of slobber. His wife said Roxy's drool was so bad she banished the dog from the house.

Sticking up for his companion, Mr Morris took cute Roxy to work and trained his companion to never leave his side, so he could clear up his slimy mess for her.

Father-of-three Mr Morris, 46,Â  said: 'She has come with me since she's been a pup, so she's become comfortable sitting in the van.

'She dribbles so my partner used to moan about her being at home dribbling and shaking it everywhere so it was better for her to sit in the van with me and shake it over me.'

So smooth: Chilled out Roxy has become a minor celebrity in central London where Mr Morris drives around every day on his courier service

The dude: Tourists stop to take pictures of the mastiff as she hangs out, looking completely relaxed

Roxy first joined Mr Morris when she 
was just six months old. Now she's an old hand on his routine and 
dutifully leaps into the van every day.

'She's got a good nature, she's very 
placid but if I'm waiting for a job and I fall asleep nobody can get 
near to the van without her waking me up.'

Now you'll never see one without the other - Roxy even waits for Mr Morris outside the toilet door.
