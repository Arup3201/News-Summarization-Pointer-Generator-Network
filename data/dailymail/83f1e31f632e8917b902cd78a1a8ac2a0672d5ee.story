A newlywed mentally disabled couple forced to live apart after their respective care homes deemed them 'incapable' of cohabitation may soon be able to move in together.

Since Paul Forziano, 30, and Hava Samuels, 36, got married in April they have been living three miles apart in Long Island, New York.

But according to court papers, the couple have been offered an apartment in a group home for the mentally disabled in Riverhead, Long Island, run by East End Disability Associates.

Heartbreaking: Paul Farziano and Hava Samuels tied the knot last month, but haven't been allowed to live together because their respective care homes do not permit married couples

The apartment is attached to a group home housing eight others with similar disabilities.

'Seeing the apartment was a thrill for them,' Forziano's mother, Roseann Forziano, told Newsday.

The couple had launched a lawsuit after being told they wouldn't be allowed to share a bedroom by the state-sanctioned nonprofits that ran the group homes they currently live in.

Forziano said East End Disability Associates has been more open than the previous facilities the couple tried to occupy, and seems eager to help the newlyweds.

'They’re a little more progressive, they’re a little more flexible, they have a better attitude towards change,' Forziano said.

She believes being able to live together like any other couple will help their development and progression.

The look of love: From July the couple will live together in their own apartment at a home for the mentally disabled

'He will be living in a new situation as a married man 24/7 which I think is going to be great for them,' Forziano said.

'They’ve both grown very much from their relationship and I think being able to live together in a normal setting like a married couple will also continue to help them reach their potential.'

Samuels' mother, Bonnie, had previously said she never 
envisioned her daughter would ever be married, let alone become 
embroiled in a legal fight over it.

'It does make me very angry,' she 
said, 'that people say they want the best and the most for these 
individuals, or want them to have the type of life that they would like 
to have and let them grow as much as they can, and yet they're being 
told no.'

The couple had been considering marriage for three years before tying the knot in April. The couple's parents, also plaintiffs in the case, said they have been seeking a solution to the problem of where the couple would live since 2010.

'It's not something we wanted to do, it's something we had to do,' said Samuels, the mother of the bride.

Perfect match: The couple met several years ago while attending a performing arts education program

The lawsuit claimed that Forziano's facility refused because people requiring the services of a group home are by definition incapable of living as married people, and it says Samuels' home refused because it believes she doesn't have the mental capacity to consent to sex.

A spokeswoman for the Catholic Health 
Systems, which runs the Maryhaven Center of Hope, declined to 
comment, citing pending litigation. Maryhaven has 2,000 clients, ranging
in age from five to 80, in facilities across Long Island. The facility 
in Manorville where Samuels lives is for women only.

David Arntsen, attorney for the 
Independent Group Home Living program in Manorville, where Forziano 
lives, said it didn't have facilities for married residents and there was no specific legal requirement forcing the home to house 
them.

The program's residences have between three and 12 men and women; the home where Forziano lives is coed, according to his attorney.

The lawsuit cites a letter from the director of program services at Independent Group Home Living, saying its homes 'are not staffed or designed to house and supervise married couples or assist married couples with the dynamics of their relationships, sexual or otherwise.'

Mr Forziano is classified in the mild to moderate range of intellectual functioning, with recent IQ scores of 50 and 58. He has limited reading and writing skills and cannot manage money.

The couple currently spend their days together in the performing arts education center where they met and with their families

Ms Samuels is in the moderate range of intellectual functioning, with recent IQ scores of 50 and 44.

She
has a significant expressive language disability, which can make it 
difficult sometimes for others to understand her. The Social Security 
Administration offers disability benefits when a person's IQ is below 
70.

The couple met several years ago while attending the performing arts education program for mentally disabled adults, which teaches the basics of staging and set design, and offers singing and acting lessons.

'She's very beautiful and she helps me,' Forziano says of his new bride, adding, 'We're very sad when we leave each other... I want to live with my wife, because I love her.'

Samuels says she fell for her future husband because he was funny; she particularly liked his 'knock-knock' jokes. But her eyes begin to well up with tears when asked about her current living situation. 'I'm not happy,' she says. 'We live apart.'

They spend their days together in the performing arts education center where they met.
