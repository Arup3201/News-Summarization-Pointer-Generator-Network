Phil Jagielka will not be posting more live messages on social media during the England games after his 'Tweet of Death' moment in last week’s friendly against Ecuador.

Centre-half Jagielka, not selected for the game, posted a selfie as he watched the game from the bench alongside Steven Gerrard and Daniel Sturridge.

It was accompanied by a message which said: 'Decent start from the boys!' but almost immediately Ecuador scored.

Tweet of death: Jagielka's pitch-side selfie, posted to twitter, caused something of a social media storm

Curse: Jagielka's tweet from the bench came just seconds before Enner Valencia headed Ecuador in front

'I’ve had a bit of ribbing off the lads,' said Jagielka. 'It’s been classed the 'Tweet of Death'. I’m still early days with Twitter, so please bear with me and I’ll try to get better.

'I wouldn’t have done it in a game I was involved in, obviously. I wasn’t involved and just wanted to wish the boys good luck but it took me too long to work out how to do anything and by the time I’d pressed ‘send’, literally 20 seconds later, Ecuador scored.

'I was thinking: how do I delete this now, and Bainesy told me: You’ve got no chance, just deal with it. Everyone took it in fairly good spirits and no-one’s too annoyed with me.'

Meanwhile, Gary Neville has transferred his TV skills to the England video analysis department, according to Jagielka.

England are starting to focus on Italy and Jagielka said: 'The teams we’re playing against, we know a few of the strikers already because they play in the Premier League or some of the big clubs around Europe, so you’ve an idea of what you’re up against.

Focus: Roy Hodgson's men have turned their attention to blunting Italy's attack next Saturday

Pundit: Gary Neville's work on TV has prepared him to lead England's video analysis of opponents in Brazil

'But there’s so much video you can get hold of. We’ve got three video analysis people here.

'Obviously, Gary Neville’s more than capable of taking you through a video or two. It’s pretty much like watching Monday Night Football, with more of a personal touch, and he can’t tell you off.

'We’ve got all the equipment that we need. We’ll look at the Italian pairings, those who could potentially play up front for Italy, get that game out of the way and then move on to Uruguay and Costa Rica.'
