From a hunk of roast beef to a piece of sushi and a Nando's chicken, these foodie snaps are enough to make your savoury saliva glands start to drool.

But before you get too excited about a slippery piece of salmon or a crispy roast potato, look a bit closer: these savoury foods are actually made of cake.

These quirky sweet treats are the handiwork of creative baker Louise Caola, a 23-year old Londoner who has just quit her job in advertising to pursue her fun kitchen hobby as a full time career, naming her business Poppy&Lulu.

Incr-edible! Louise Caola, 23, started baking in her free time, creating amazing designs like this uncanny roast beef and potato meal, and has now turned her hobby into a full-time business

Where it all started: Louise made this sausage and mash as a joke for a friend... but on closer inspection it is sponge cake

Louise has been baking since she was a young girl, and fondly remembers sitting on her kitchen surface helping her mother make cakes.

After studying fashion marketing at university she landed a job in an advertising firm, and would bake cakes in her free time.

She created her first sausage and mash cake as a joke for a friend's birthday, but couldn't believe the positive response she got.

Immediately she began creating more and more fake-savoury cakes in her free time, then posting the pictures on her Twitter and Instagram pages.

As a result, orders began flooding in from people all over the internet.

Uncanny: Louise says this Nando's creation was the hardest she has ever made, and involved her individually rolling out each tiny piece of corn

Not your average meat-feast pizza: Louise quit her full-time job in advertising to pursue dreams of baking cakes that look exactly like savoury food

Speaking to MailOnline, she said: 'I was working really long hours and then would come home and bake.

'I started taking it seriously a few years ago and then I got so much positive feedback that I thought "there must be something in this".

'After much umm-ing and ahh-ing I decided to quit my job to pursue this full-time.'

Louise is currently in the process of launching a website and fully establishing her brand, which she has named Poppy&Lulu after close childhood friends, but she has already been flooded with requests for fun cakes.

Her cakes can take up to four hours to create - and often involve a lot of trial and error.

She is planning on baking an eggs Benedict-themed cake this weekend, as well as a cake styled like steak and 
chips, and a bunch of bananas.

Intricate detail: She describes herself as very determined and is always keen to perfect her cakes to the finest details - like each piece of beef in this burrito

Realistic: Her creations, like this scarily realistic fish, chips and peas meal, take her around four hours to complete and often involve a lot of trial and error

'I don't know how I am going to get the cake to look like a tomato in my steak and chips dish. but I love a challenge!', she added.

She cites her favourite - and most popular - cake as the roast beef one, and says the Nando's one was the hardest to create.

'I rolled out each tiny piece of corn for the sweetcorn in the Nando's dish, which was hard, but I am always determined to complete a cake, even if it takes a few failed attempts.'

Master chef: Louise is the creative brains behind the cakes, and hopes to expand her business and deliver nationwide

Sweet sushi: Whilst this sushi roll looks like it would taste fishy, you'd be in for a sweet treat tucking into it

Creative eye: Louise studied elements of graphic design at Nottingham Trent Universitym and credits this for her attention to detail

It tastes sweeter than it looks! Louise has been flooded by requests for cakes on her Twitter and Instagram page, despite only starting a few weeks ago

Louise, who studied fashion marketing at Nottingham Trent University and credits her creative skills to the graphic design she learnt, says she loves creating and making things, and has grand plans for the future.

'I have only been doing this full-time for a few weeks, but you just have to run with these things.

'At the moment I just offer hand-delivery to places in London, but the dream is to expand it nationwide and have a team of bakers helping me create wonderful cakes.'

Italian with a twist: Louise loves taking on challenges, and while this spaghetti bolognese creation was one of the more simple, she is hoping to attempt making cake that looks like fruit next

It's not what it looks like! This incredible Cornish pasty looks like a tasty deep-fat treat - but when cut in half it is filled with delicious chocolate sponge
