He is known as one of RTE’s most dapper newsreaders...but it will take more than a little concealer to cover Aengus Mac Grianna’s blushes after the News Now anchorman was broadcast touching up his  own make-up live on air.

The clip, which has caused much mirth across the internet, catches the polished host giving himself a sprucing up, not realising that the cameras are rolling.

At first he is seen applying a touch of foundation to his forehead – using what appears to be his own compact – then momentarily rolling his shoulders and sucking his cheeks.

Button it: RTÉ newsreader Aengus Mac Grianna was filmed readying himself for a broadcast without realising the cameras were rolling

He moves on to his tie, tugging and teasing it into its best shape and ensuring that he has not allowed it to slip down from his collar.

Ever the professional, Mac Grianna then gives himself a proper grooming, sweeping his shoulders with the palm of his hand to make sure there is no hint of fluff – or anything else – on his suit shoulders.

But then, as he begins to remove an errant piece of lint from his cuff, there is a terrible pang of realisation.

A member of the production staff on RTÉ’s digital news channel has clearly informed him that he is in fact grooming himself live on air.

The newscaster lets out a furious ‘What!?’, the clip ends – and before he knows it, Mac Grianna’s blooper is the talk of the internet.

Happily, the Dubliner has taken the episode in good spirits, calling it one of the hazards of the job.

Wuh oh: When the newsreader realised he was on live television he shouted 'What!' The clip has become a hit since it was posted on the internet

He said: ‘It was a technical problem and simply one of the hazards of the trade.

'I
 can’t believe it’s been of such interest, but I am delighted that so 
many people are watching our digital news channel News Now. And yes, I’m
 back to the desk as normal again today!’

The
 clip was an immediate hit online when it emerged on Wednesday night, 
but much to the dismay of many, RTÉ then removed it from its own 
play-back service and YouTube.

A spokesman for the station insisted that it was not an effort to censor people’s enjoyment of the clip but rather to ensure that Mac Grianna approved of the clip’s circulation.

Reporting the news live on air requires perfect composure – but from time to time even the most professional presenter can crumble under pressure.

And in the age of viral videos, viewers from all around the world can now enjoy a chuckle at some of the most memorable news bloopers.

One particularly entertaining clip shows what happened when unsuspecting jobseeker Guy Goma – who believed he was being interviewed for a job at the BBC – is mistaken for Apple expert Guy Kewney by a BBC news team and interviewed live on air.

Hilariously the Congo graduate was questioned by the BBC 24-hour news team about an The Beatles’ Apple company vs Apple computers court case that was in progress at the time. In the clip from 2006, which now has been watched by over a million people on YouTube, Mr Goma is shown looking nervous but manages to answerthree questions.

He later told the team that he was ‘happy to speak about any situation’ on air but would like more time to prepare his answers.

Mr Goma’s ordeal has gone down in the annals of notable bloopers and there is never a shortage of others to fill the funny reels.

In another memorable case, some frisky alpacas lent an unexpected X-rated edge to a presenter’s report for a popular breakfast show in New Zealand when they started to mate in the background of her clip.

And when the duo failed to cease quickly, the embarrassed reporter told viewers: ‘I am sorry to all of the parents out there watching with children. You’ll have to have that conversation now.’

Closer to home, RTÉ’s Sharon Ní Bheoláin was also caught out when the camera cut to her during a link with The Daily Show and viewers watched as the news anchor pursed her lips to prepare for the update, unaware that the camera was firmly on her.

A spokesman said: ‘When we knew it had been uploaded, our first instinct was to ensure that Aengus was okay about it.’

‘He was not aware that the clip had been put up, so we took it down from our own player and YouTube. It wasn’t his fault; it was a technical error. Since then, we’ve learned that Aengus is not unhappy about it and is fine with it. So we are not going to pursue it.’

In fact, the clip has only increased Mac Grianna’s popularity. Viewer Louise McSharry wrote on Twitter: ‘I don’t think there is a person in the country who doesn’t love #aengus more now than they did when they woke up this morning.’

Stylist Ingrid Hoey wrote: ‘I’m in Love with Aengus Mac Grianna, I mean the man has his OWN compact.’

The newscaster is no stranger to the blooper reel and going viral on the internet.

Just last month, a clip of him struggling with a malfunctioning autocue over a news report about the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 17 mission became a viral hit.
