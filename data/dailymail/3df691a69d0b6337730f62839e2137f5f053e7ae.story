Bayern Munich forward Thomas Muller has sent a crushing blow in the direction of Old Trafford by denying rumours of a potential move to Manchester United.

The German international has been heavily linked with United in recent days, as rumours of his discontent under coach Pep Guardiola have grown.

But speaking to the Austrian paper Krone, Muller played down the idea that he might leave Bayern this summer.

Denial: Thomas Muller has denied he is leaving Bayern Munich to sign for Manchester United this summer

'I didn't make these rumours up myself, so I don't particularly want to comment on them too much, but I'm definitely not about to jump ship at Bayern,' said the 24-year-old, 'That said, I can't make any guarantees (that I'll stay at the club) for all time.'

Muller's apparent frustration has stemmed from a lack of playing time in Guardiola's rotation system, with appearances being particularly sparse in the Champions League. At various points in the season, he has appeared openly annoyed in post-match interviews about having to sit on the bench.

Many have speculated that, with Louis van Gaal set to take over at Manchester United, Muller might make the switch to the Premier League. The Dutchman was the man who established Muller as a first-team player at Bayern.

But as rumours have grown, many prominent figures around the Munich club, most recently Franz Beckenbauer and Steffen Effenberg, have come out to discourage Muller from leaving. The native Bavarian has been described a 'rock' at Bayern, and 'unimaginable elsewhere'.

The speculation around Bayern's unsettled squad will not end with MÃ¼ller's comments today, however, as other players have commented about their frustration in recent days.

Jerome Boateng told reporters at a sponsorship event that 'the atmosphere among the squad isn't very good anymore', while Javi Martinez openly said that he had imagined a different career path at Bayern to the one he has taken this season.

Relief: Guardiola will be pleased to hear that Muller is staying at Bayern Munich for the foreseeable future
