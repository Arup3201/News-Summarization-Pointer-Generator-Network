A group of businessmen are to trawl a lake near Berlin in search of almost £1billion worth of Nazi gold allegedly dumped by Hermann Goering.

The Luftwaffe chief is said to have disposed of the treasure in the spring of 1945 to stop the Soviet Red Army getting their hands on it as they closed in on the German capital.

Up to 18 boxes of gold were apparently thrown in Stolpsee Lake, about an hour’s drive north of Berlin in the former Communist East Germany.

Stolpsee Lake lies in north-west Germany, close to the former home of Hermann Goering and was trawled unsuccessfully by the East Germans in 1986

Polish slave workers ordered to dump it were allegedly machine-gunned on the shore afterwards, their bodies following the gold into the depths.In 1986 Stasi chief Erich Mielke ordered a trawl of the water but nothing was found.

Now the search has been reignited after claims by a local priest.

The lake will be searched by submarines from October in a hunt financed by a group of unidentified businessmen.

The priest, Erich Koehler, 77, who has researched the legend of the treasure, said: ‘They didn’t have the technology in the former East Germany to properly examine the lake.

‘But there are enough local people still around to know that the gold is there – and the bodies of the poor souls forced to dump it into the water.'

Goering emptied his country home, Carinhall, of its loot and art treasures shortly before ordering it to be dynamited in the closing weeks of the war as the Red Army marched on Berlin.

According to authorities, the documents Mielke worked from still lie undiscovered in the millions of papers that make up the Berlin archive of the Stasi secret police.

Goering garnered astonishing wealth from lands conquered by the Nazis in the Second World War, including dozens of rare masterpieces from galleries across Europe.

Each weekend the ruins of Carinhall attract dozens of treasure hunters who believe that some of his wealth still lies in the grounds of the old mansion.

The consortium have been bolstered in their confidence of finding treasure from papers found in the German Federal Archive in Koblenz.

SS documents together with post-war eye witness statements to the events on the lake in March 1945, give credence to the theory that precious material was indeed dumped into the 400-feet deep lake.

One witness, Eckhard Litz, told a post-war allied commission: 'I remember well the night that lorries with slit headlights drove up to the lakeshore and I saw about 20 to 30 skeletal figures dressed in striped concentration camp uniforms being forced to unload heavy boxes.

'These were put into two rowing boats which made six separate trips to the centre of the lake.

'When the last case had been thrown overboard, the men returned to shore, were lined up and the last thing I saw were the flashes of the machine guns of the guards as they were killed.'

He said the bodies were then loaded back onto the rowing boats which were then taken out by the SS to the centre of the lake and sunk. A third boat brought back the SS men to the shore.

Goering is alleged to have personally taken charge of numerous amounts of bullion from the national bank of Poland following the Nazi invasion in 1939.

It is this gold which is believed to lie at the bottom of the lake, just a few miles from the estate that he owned.
