A stunning clifftop known as the Troll's Tongue has become a magnet for thrill-seeking hikers.

Groups of tourists flock to the breathtaking Trolltunga landmark in southern Norway, which sits a dizzying 700 metres above the Ringedalsvatnet Lake.

No safety railing has been constructed on the edge of the cliff, which is just several metres wide, as tourism bosses want to preserve the natural beauty of the landmark.

And local mountain guides explain that travellers often attempt to outdo each other when it comes to taking the most spectacular and daring pictures on the clifftop, which was formed 10,000 years ago following the end of the last ice age.

The most popular pictures include couples kissing and leaping in the air at the cliff's edge.

The Troll's Tongue is available for hikers to access between mid-June to mid-September each year, and it takes visitors around eight hours to walk there and back from the local village of Skjeggedal. 

Mountain guide Jostein Soldal, who has been taking groups to the Trolltunga since 2009, said: 'The groups challenge and inspire each other to come up with better or funnier pictures. I really like the photos where big groups of people are jumping and you capture the perfect moment mid-air.'
