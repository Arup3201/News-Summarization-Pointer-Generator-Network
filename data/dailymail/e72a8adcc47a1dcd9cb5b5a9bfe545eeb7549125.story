Sergio Aguero is a modern day football genius who always plays the game with a smile on his face, according to Manchester City team-mate Frank Lampard.

Lampard says he is quite an intense player who can get quite down if things are not going his way, but revealed the Argentina international is quite the opposite.

Aguero has been in good form this season, scoring 23 goals in all competitions, and City will hope he is at his best again this week when they travel to the Nou Camp in the second leg of their Champions League tie with Barcelona.

Manuel Pellegrini's side trail 2-1 after the first leg in Manchester and face an up hill task if they are to overhaul the La Liga leaders. 

Lampard in Match of the Day magazine: ‘Football comes easy to him – he bounces into training without a care in the world, then plays like a genius. I’m intense about my football and if I have a bad day I can get quite upset, so it’s always nice to see someone like Sergio, who also has bad days but just smiles it away!’

After spending 13 years at Chelsea, Lampard moved north to Manchester City and says he is getting on well with his new teammates.

He added: ‘I get on with them all but David Silva is a fantastic bloke. I’ve loved him as a footballer from afar, but when you meet him you realise how humble he is.'

Lampard will head Stateside at the end of the Premier League to link up with new MLS franchise New York City FC and so this is likely to be his last game at the Nou Camp.

He added: ‘It’s one of football’s great arenas. I’ve had the runaround there, but I’ve also been fortunate to have some of my best nights there. The old stadium, the size of it, the fans – you can feel the magic and the history. I’ll be delighted to go back.

‘Football is like a religion in Spain, but what I will say is that all the Spanish players who come here never stop talking about how great it is to play football in England – the fans, how every stadium you go to has a great atmosphere, so we can't complain.’

And with Lampard’s time in England coming to an end, he is able to look back on his years in the Premier League with fondness – even though he would like a few minutes on the pitch before he heads to New York.

He said: ‘I’d like to play more minutes and games – that would be a start! Football is not always about fairytales, but my career as a whole has been a fairytale. I never dreamed I’d get to win the Champions League with Chelsea and play for my country over 100 times. I’m pretty happy with that.’
