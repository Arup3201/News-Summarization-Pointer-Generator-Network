Many of us will vow to give up alcohol this month, due to the toll it takes on our looks and health. But should it be coffee we’re quitting instead?

What started out as a morning treat has turned into a number of caffeine fixes to get us through the day. But like booze, regularly consuming more than the safe daily limit of caffeine (between 200 and 400 mg, equivalent to two large Americanos at a High Street chain) is undoubtedly bad for us.

While it may stimulate the tastebuds and keep us alert, drinking too much coffee can pile on the pounds, age our skin, and even be responsible for cystitis, cellulite and bad breath. TANITH CAREY reports.

Your skin looks older

These days, it seems no one goes anywhere without a takeout coffee cup. But the habit could lead to prematurely older-looking skin, according to nutritionist Marisa Peer.

‘One coffee is no worse than a glass of wine, but you can have too much of it,’ she says. ‘Skin needs lots of water to look plump and glowing. But coffee is a diuretic, encouraging your body to flush out water. If you drink too much coffee, your skin will look as dehydrated as when you have a hangover.’

Flooding your body with caffeine means your nervous system is in a constant state of artificial stimulation, adds Marisa. ‘Skin is your largest organ and needs oxygen-rich blood. When the body is in a state of stress, it responds by directing the most highly-oxygenated blood towards the heart and lungs, so skin doesn’t get as well nourished.

‘The lymphatic system, which clears waste products, also doesn’t work as efficiently, leaving skin sluggish and breakout-prone.’

You get cellulite

Caffeine is an ingredient in some skin creams — but that doesn’t mean drinking it will have the same positive effect.

There are 16,501 coffee shops in the UK, with sales growing by 6.4 per cent from last year 

‘Coffee is used in many anti-cellulite creams — applied to the outside of the skin, it draws out the stored toxins in the fat cells, thereby reducing cellulite,’ says nutritionist Vicki Edgson, author of Gut Gastronomy, which looks at the latest evidence on how to revitalise the digestive system.

She adds that dehydration caused by coffee encourages the skin to become congested and hardened and to form a dense mesh, which leads to cellulite.

You get bad breath

like alcohol, coffee dehydrates your mouth, says dentist Dr Sameer Patel, of the Elleven Dental Practice in London. ‘As a result, there’s less saliva to rinse your mouth and fight bacteria.’

And if you drink milky coffee, this allows the milky residue to ferment and rot, giving off noxious smells, he adds.

Over time, caffeine can turn teeth yellow in the same way as nicotine from cigarettes. Dentist Dr Mayank Morar of AP Smilecare, in Blackburn, says: ‘Coffee contain tannins — plant compounds which give these drinks their flavour — and acids. Over time, these break down the enamel on teeth’s surface.

‘The tannins penetrate the surface and stick to the enamel. Over time, that can make the teeth look yellow or brown.’

You put on weight

A Starbucks whole milk Venti Caffe Latte has 299 calories — while the apparently less fattening semi-skimmed version has only 50 fewer calories

It’s known that drinking too much booze can make you pile on the pounds. But your coffee habit may also be to blame. For example, a Starbucks whole milk Venti Caffe Latte has 299 calories — while the apparently less fattening semi-skimmed version has only 50 fewer calories. That’s more than a 250ml glass of white wine at 185 calories.

If we grab a carbohydrate treat, such as a muffin, at the counter, coffee’s effect on blood sugar makes those goodies even more fattening, a study by the University of Guelph in Canada found. Nutritional therapist Shani Shaker says caffeine interferes with insulin levels, which control how much fat our bodies store.

‘In the Canadian study, it was found people having the coffee and carbs combination tripled their blood sugar levels, while insulin was reduced by half.

‘This combination of high blood glucose levels and poor insulin function is a recipe for weight gain and increased risk of diabetes, as the excess blood glucose is dumped into storage as fat.’

Celebrity trainer Christianne Wolff, author of The Body Rescue Plan, says all her clients who have given up caffeine have lost weight. ‘Caffeine can affect people’s sleep, which means they are more tired during the day,’ she says. ‘This can lead to weight gain as they crave carbs and sugar and are less likely to have the energy to exercise.’

You have bad toilet habits

Drinking more than three cups of coffee a day has a diuretic effect on the body, because it interferes with the hormones that regulate our water balance.

This leaves us dehydrated and makes urine more concentrated and acidic, inflaming the walls of the bladder and even leading to painful urination and cystitis.

In a study by the University of Alabama, of 1,356 women who drank around three cups of coffee or more a day, 70 per cent were more likely to have bladder problems. In fact, women who suffer from urinary incontinence are advised by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to cut back on coffee.

You’re tired all the time

The energy boost we get from a shot of coffee is short-lived. Coffee keeps us artificially wired by stimulating the adrenals — two walnut-size glands sitting on top of your kidneys, which control stress hormones.

It can be hard to tell how much caffeine we are drinking when buying coffee. Glasgow University researchers bought single-shot espressos from 20 coffee shops in the city and measured their caffeine content. Four had more than 200mg in a single cup — the strongest had more than 300mg, almost at the daily accepted safe amount.

If the levels of fight-or-flight hormone are constantly raised by a flood of caffeine during the day, raising heart and breathing rates and muscle tension, this can cause long-term fatigue.

Factor in that it takes from five to 12 hours for the body to get rid of caffeine and, when you fall into bed, you may still not be able to sleep. Once you do nod off, coffee makes sleep lighter and more disturbed.

Studies have found this is because caffeine interferes with the production of melatonin, which helps us sleep.

A study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found drinking caffeine as much as six hours before bed significantly disturbs sleep, reducing total sleep by over an hour.

Every day’s a bad hair day

Caffeine has been found to flush vital minerals, including iron needed for healthy hair growth, out of the body.

The effect is thinning hair, according to Cassandra Barns, nutritionist at nutricentre.com. ‘Our body needs good supplies of certain vitamins and minerals for good hair condition and pigmentation, including biotin, selenium, zinc and copper.

‘If we consume lots of coffee, this will affect our mineral stores, which could have a negative impact on hair condition, including shine and texture.’

The loss of minerals may even trigger hair loss and premature greyness. ‘One of the primary causes of hair loss in women before menopause is low levels of iron, and coffee affects their absorption of that. Copper is thought to contribute to hair pigmentation, so any deficiency may cause early greying.’

Trichologist Iain Sallis says women are more at risk of caffeine-induced hair loss than men. ‘Lack of iron shortens the hair’s growth cycle, making it fall out more quickly,’ he says. ‘This is especially so for women, who are more susceptible because of low iron levels due to blood loss during their menstrual cycles.’

You find it harder to conceive

If you are thinking of having a baby, fertility expert Zita West advises cutting back on coffee.

Studies in the British Journal of Pharmacology show caffeine stops the muscles in the Fallopian tubes in the ovaries from contracting. These rhythmic contractions waft the egg from the ovaries to the womb to be met by sperm. Instead, the egg gets ‘stuck’.

Other research has found a link between caffeine and conception problems. Dutch researchers at Radbout University found women who drink more than 300mg of caffeine a day (two 8oz cups of coffee) have a 27 per cent lower chance of getting pregnant, compared with women who don’t drink it.

Once conception has taken place, more than one coffee a day can put your unborn baby at risk, as caffeine has been found to constrict blood vessels and interfere with hormone levels.

One study found women who drink more than 200mg of caffeine a day have double the miscarriage rate, compared with non-drinkers. The studies have led the NHS to advise pregnant women to have no more than two cups of instant coffee a day.

Zita says: ‘If you are trying for a baby, it would be wiser to regard coffee as an occasional treat.’
