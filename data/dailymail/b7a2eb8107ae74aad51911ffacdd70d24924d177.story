Shocking Facebook photos of a father who had his jaw broken in a street beating were reported to the social networking giant - for 'inciting violence'.

Wife Laurette Martin, 38, spoke of her outrage after receiving the report on images of her HGV driver husband Jim lying in his hospital bed, which she shared with the world to catch his attacker.

Rangers fan Mr Martin, a father-of-four, was attacked in a suspected act of hooliganism on Sunday near his home in Newarthill, Lanarkshire, hours after watching his team play rivals Celtic in Glasgow.

Photos of his injuries were quickly shared online and were included in news reports on the violence around the match, prompting an anonymous user to report them to Facebook.

Mrs Martin, whose husband is now recovering out of hospital, was accused of breaking the social media site's rules on explicit content - though fortunately for her, the photos were not removed. 

'I have been reported for promoting graphical violence by posting my husband's bloody face after his brutal attack,' she said.

'I posted this photo because I wanted to get information on who the culprits where and to show people who might have been involved or who might know the culprits what they have done to my wonderful loving husband, a father of four children.

'In no way have I done this to promote violence but to make people aware and to be carefully when out at night as there are so many evil people out there.

'If anyone has a problem with what I post and don't like it then by all means contact me before making a silly statements that are not true.

'I really don't have time to worry about silly things as I have more important things to worry about at this moment in time but it has annoyed me.'

Facebook rules forbid anyone from posting content that 'incites violence' or includes graphic scenes.

The rules state: 'You will not post content that: is hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.' 

However, the social networking site reviews cases and does not remove every image reported to it. 

The attack happened hours after Sunday's match between the two rivals, who are known as the Old Firm.

Mr Martin's 17-year-old son Jordan was also a victim of the same attack but managed to escape.

There was also outrage after a ten-year-old fan, Kieran Duffy, had a bottle thrown at his head on the way to watch the clash with his twin brother Declan.

A local businessman has since offered a £1,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Kieran's attacker.

Mr Martin was set upon as he walked past the McAlpine's Bar pub at 10.40pm on his way home from a local shop. 

Doctors needed to operate on Mr Martin's broken jaw amid fears he might have suffered permanent brain damage.

The HGV driver also suffered broken teeth and cuts and bruises to his face after being punched and kicked in the head as he lay on the ground.

His 17-year-old son Jordan managed to escape after being punched and raised the alarm. 

Dressmaker Mrs Martin added: 'These scumbags have no idea what this has done to my family, our kids who are so upset by this and my baby who keeps asking for her daddy.

'I wanted to get information on who the culprits were and to show people who might have been involved or who might know the culprits what they have done to my wonderful loving husband.'

Facebook has repeatedly been criticised for removing new mothers' 'breastfeeding pride' photos because they supposedly break nudity rules.

Emma Bond, 24, of Oswestry, Shropshire, had a photo of her nursing premature baby Carene removed on the day she uploaded it in October. 

And in 2011 breast cancer survivor Melissa Tullett, from Rochester, Kent, was outraged when she had a celebratory photo of her reconstructed breasts removed from the site.

Facebook reinstated Ms Bond's photo - but told Ms Tullett she would have to keep her photos offline. 

Three men aged 19, 23, and 29 had been arrested in connection with the alleged assault on Mr Martin, police said.
