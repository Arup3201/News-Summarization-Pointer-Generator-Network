An extreme marathon runner may be forced to close her animal sanctuary after an airline charged her thousands of pounds to rebook her flight when she got trapped in Antarctica while fund-raising.

Fiona Oakes, 44, had taken part in a 25-mile race in -20C blizzards - and set a world record - before she discovered her flight could not take off because of bad weather.

She says that despite having paid Air France £5,700 for return flights to Chile, they charged her nearly £6,400 to rebook after she and her mother missed their connecting flight.

Fiona Oakes, 44, who raises funds for her animal sanctuary by running marathons, says she may have to close it after Air France charged her to rebook her flights when she was snowed in at Antarctica

Despite losing her kneecap to cancer when she was younger, Ms Oakes is a record-beating athlete

Ms Oakes and her partner Martin Morgan, 49, run their Essex animal sanctuary entirely from donations

The amount she had to pay was double the sponsor money she had raised for her Essex sanctuary which is home to 400 horses, dogs and cats.

Now Ms Oakes says the future of her Tower Hill sanctuary hangs in the balance as she no longer has any money to compete in any more fund-raising marathons and will not be able to feed the animals.

Ms Oakes, who has run eight extreme marathons on seven continents in the past year, said: 'I’ve barely enough money to see out next month.

'I only raised around £3,000 from sponsorship and the new flights cost double that.  It’s outrageous. If I can’t find any more money soon I will have to close the doors which will devastate me as it’s all I have worked for.

'I can’t believe they would be so cruel and heartless. I only run the marathons for the animals.  It was one of the harshest things I’ve done and now it looks like it was all for nothing.

'Air France has no heart. They are literally taking food out of the mouths of desperate animals.'

Ms Oakes says it costs her and her partner, Martin Morgan, 49, £10,000 a month to run the sanctuary, where they have 22 dogs, 53 horses, 82 pigs, 50 cats, 40 sheep, goats, three cows and assorted chicken, geese and ducks.

Ms Oakes, who runs marathons to pay the sanctuary's bills, has even completed the Marathon des Sable, right

Ms Oakes, who lost her right kneecap to a cancerous tumour when she was a teenager and who was nominated for the Daily Mail Inspirational Women of the Year prize in 2012, turned to sponsored running to bring in money for her sanctuary.

She won the Great North Run for her age category in 2010, has completed the notorious Marathon Des Sables desert race, and now has the world record for being the fastest woman to run a marathon on each continent after completing the North Pole marathon, Atlantic city, Siberian, Atacama desert, Adelaide, Arctic and Antarctic marathons.

In November she completed her fifth marathon in eleven weeks, becoming the fastest female to finish the Antarctic Ice Marathon in record time.

But treacherous weather moved in, cutting the competitors off from the outside world, and they spent the next week stuck in tents on the ice.

She said: 'It was really cold and scary as we never knew when we were getting off the ice.  No-one could rescue us as the weather was so bad.'

Her travel company contacted Air France to explain Ms Oakes' predicament, and she expected to be given discounted tickets because of the unusual and unavoidable situation.

But to her astonishment they said they would sell her tickets for a replacement flight, for £6,400, to cover the difference in fares plus a penalty for changing her flight details.

Ms Oakes had to hand over all her sponsorship cash and more to get home as she needed to return to the UK to care for her animals.

She said: 'I have to travel business class to lie my knee out after running because I have no kneecap and a knee joint replacement. The pain is too much otherwise.

'I couldn’t believe they wanted everything I had made: all my sponsors' monies and more. It was daylight robbery.

'They had no compassion for what I had been through.'

Since then the airline has offered her £1,200, but are refusing to refund the full amount.

A spokesman for Air France said: 'We became aware of the situation after she contacted us in December. We then offered to waive extra charges applied to the booking as well as donation of £1,000 towards her charity.

'We are deeply sympathetic to the problems encountered by Mrs Oakes, but we did accept two bookings in business class in good faith.

'We responded in similar good faith after we heard about her particular case with a donation to her charity, but it is normal practice for the cost of any delays to be covered by a good insurance travel policy.

'We hope Mrs Oakes will accept our donation and continue to wish her well.'
