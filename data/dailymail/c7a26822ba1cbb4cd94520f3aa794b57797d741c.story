Word at Tottenham's state-of-the-art Enfield training complex is that the club will make a concerted effort to sign Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez in January.

What's for sure is manager Mauricio Pochettino needs to inject some life into his misfiring forward line, sooner rather than later.

Wednesday night's Capital One Cup clash against Brighton merely underlined the White Hart Lane club's need for a shiny new striker once the transfer window re-opens.

Spurs will reportedly make a January move for Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez

Between them, Spurs' strike trio of Emmanuel Adebayor, Roberto Soldado and Harry Kane have scored five domestic goals this season.

Kane, who scored last night, and Adebayor have two apiece, Soldado just one. Two of the five - both from Adebayor - have come in the league.

In short: not good enough. Certainly not good enough for a team with aspirations of breaking into the Champions League qualification places.

It was Soldado and Kane's turn to improve on that dismal record last night. But, once more, chance after chance was squandered before Kane tapped home late on as Brighton chased an equaliser.

Kane, if given a prolonged run in the team, could solve Pochettino's problems - but the manager's reluctance to start the England Under-21 man in the league speaks volumes.

'You demand me to play Harry Kane in every game and he played today,' said Pochettino last night.

'He [Kane] shares with Adebayor and Soldado, they can share minutes, we need to understand that.

Pochettino, upon his arrival from Southampton, insisted he wanted to give those at the club a chance to ink themselves into his blueprint.

But with every passing 90 minutes, the Argentine knows he'll have to spend on a new striker in January.

His interest in Rodriguez, a player he worked with and helped nurture at St Mary's, is no secret.

There was a willingness, certainly from Pochettino, to strike a deal with the Saints for the England international in the summer.

The long-term knee injury Rodriguez sustained towards the end of last season was one of the crucial factors in Spurs decision not to show more commitment in their attempts to land the 25-year-old.

But Rodriguez is now approaching fitness; Pochettino knows it to, having been kept updated on his target's rehabilitation.

What's more, those in control of the finances at White Hart Lane and are prepared to fund his move for Rodriguez at the turn of the year.

Persuading, Rodriguez to leave upwardly mobile Southampton for Spurs maybe harder than it sounds, though.

Pochettino will hope his relationship with the striker will help lure the forward to London. At the moment, with his current strikeforce, hope is all he has.

Pochettino inherited this Spurs forward line, and until he is able to stamp his mark on it in the transfer market, he cannot truly call this HIS Spurs side.
