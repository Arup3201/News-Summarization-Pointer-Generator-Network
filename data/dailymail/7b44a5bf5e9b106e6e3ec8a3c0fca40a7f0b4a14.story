He started his career as an acerbic blogger, known for his heated feuds and his controversial penchant for 'outing' gay celebrities.

Then in 2010, everything changed for Perez Hilton when he fronted an anti-bullying campaign and decided to change his ways - promising to be a nicer and better person. 

But as the Florida born star fails to raise support in the Celebrity Big Brother house, FEMAIL questions whether Perez has now gone full circle.

Perez Hilton entered the Big Brother house 11 days ago but already he has been labelled the 'Most Hated Man In Britain'. So, just four years after publicly pledging to become a more positive person, has the blogger dropped his nice guy image?

Perez was given a warning by Big Brother after telling fellow housemate Ken Morley that he should be afraid of what will happen when he leaves the house 

Because in the eleven days since entering the house, Perez has already earned himself the title of 'Most hated man in Britain.' 

And when Chloe Goodman left the house on Friday it was to audible cheers of, 'Get Perez Out.' 

Since the start of the show, the blogger has made a number of enemies both among his CBB co-stars and in the outside world. 

His recent goading of Alexander O'Neal left his housemates fuming and his bizarre nearly-naked humping of the  garden furniture caused fans to brand him 'offensive.'

He was also given a verbal warning by Big Brother after threatening fellow contestant Ken Morley - who had been making remarks about the women in the house - by telling him: 'I feel sorry Ken. If I were you, when I leave this house, I would be afraid.'

But should we really be so surprised by Perez's behaviour? After all, this was a man who built his career on being offensive. 

When he started his website in 2004 - after failing to become an actor following his time at New York University - his modus operandi was to slate celebrities.

He would regularly post unflattering paparazzi photographs with derogatory remarks and rude images drawn over the top.

Perez's bizarre behaviour in the house has been branded offensive by some of the shows viewers 

One of Perez's most controversial activities was to 'out' celebrities who he believed to be gay.

He was widely criticised for such behaviour, with gay rights activists claiming it could be detrimental to the the gay community and those he was outing.

Perez  - whose real name is Mario - defended his actions to Midweek Politics at the time, saying: 'I know there is some controversy about outing people, but I also believe the only way we're gonna have change is with visibility. 

'And if I have to drag some people screaming out of the closet, then I will. 

'I think that lots of celebrities have an archaic fear that being gay will hurt their career but look at Rosie (O'Donnell), Look at Ellen.'

Perez was good friends with Lady Gaga until 2011, when the pair fell out for unknown reasons. Their feud is still ongoing and two years ago she accused him of stalking her 

Perez Hilton's alter ego was inspired by Paris Hilton, who he was pictured with alongside Lil Kim in New York in 2006

Stars like Lance Bass from N'Sync and the actor Neil Patrick Harris - who were targeted by Perez - would later come out as gay.

Perez's site wasn't without its legal troubles either. In 2007, he was sued after posting illegal clips of Britney Spears' unfinished songs.

Then June 2010, he posted a Twitter link to what was thought to be an up-skirt photograph of a knicker-less Miley Cyrus.

Miley was just 17 at the time and therefore an underage woman in the eyes of American law, leading to questions being asked about whether child pornography charges should be brought against Perez.

Perez claimed at the time that Miley was in fact wearing underwear but also removed the offending photograph from his feed.

He also caused controversy in 2009 after lambasting a dying Michael Jackson following reports the star had suffered from a heart attack.

Perez claimed that Michael was faking his illness and that it was just a publicity stunt - urging fans of the late star to ask for refunds on Jackson concert tickets. 

But the singer passed away later that day and Perez went on to remove the post from his site.

Then in late 2010, the blogger posted a video declaring that things were going to change. 

Perez released a seven-minute long YouTube clip where he claimed that his site was going to become more positive, even if it meant losing revenue.  

Perez is still friends with Katy Perry, who attended his birthday party in 2010 

He said that his work with the It Gets Better campaign - which urged celebrities to support gay teenagers who were being driven to suicide by bulling - had inspired the change.

Perez said in the video statement: 'In the last week a lot of people have called me a hypocrite (for working with the charity). 

'A lot of people have said that I am a hypocrite and one of the biggest bullies out there. And there is truth to that. 

'I have on my website said things that have been hurtful to people. (But) I don't see myself as a bully. 

'I've been doing my website for six years now and in the past I would justify everything as comedy and humour and (because) these are celebrities.

'But, I don't want to have to justify what I do anymore.' 

 

Big Brother fans have taken to Twitter to speak about their hatred of Perez, with some labelling him the most hated man in Britain.

Perez continued: 'I am growing and I want to be a Dad... and I don't think it's right to make fun of kids anymore. 

'I did in the past and I regret it.'

Perez stayed true to his word - his website stopped using offensive language to describe  celebrities and the articles became much more positive.

He also overhauled his personal life. 

Perez - who was born to Cuban parents - went on an extensive diet and exercise regime slimming down by a dramatic 70 pounds.

Then in 2013, he fulfilled his dream to become a father after he fathered a son - also called Mario - with a surrogate mother.

Since changing his site, Perez has won many celebrity friends but he still has many detractors.

Perhaps the most famous of those is Lady Gaga, who was good friends with the blogger until 2011, when they fell out for an unknown reason.

Two years after they first fell out, Gaga was forced to cancel her 2013 tour due to a hip injury.

She alleged that Perez had sent her a picture of her in a wheelchair with KARMA written across it and a picture of Madonna holding a gun.

Gaga later accused Perez of stalking her after he was spotted out side her New York apartment by a fan, but he denied the claims.

He said he was only there to look at a new home and did not know that Gaga lived in the building. 

After lying relatively low for the last  year, much of the anger towards Perez from both celebrities and the certain parts of the US public had started to die down. 

But since entering the Big Brother house, he has attracted fresh attention, with his behaviour causing viewers to demand that he is kicked off the show and

As he continues to alienate his housemates, it seems he has very much fallen of his nice guy bandwagon.
