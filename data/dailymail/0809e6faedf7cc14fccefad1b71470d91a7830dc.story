The supermarket price war is set to intensify after a study found discount store Lidl was almost a third cheaper than the major chains.

The retailer was included in The Grocer magazine’s weekly price survey for the first time – and scored highly on both price and customer service.

It also emerged that Lidl and fellow budget chain Aldi have made dramatic gains in market share. In the 12 months to July 2014, Aldi’s market share rose 32.2 per cent, while Lidl’s grew 19.5 per cent.

Retail experts said their success will intensify the competition, forcing bigger chains to ‘up their game’ and slash prices.

This week, Waitrose became the latest store to offer four pints of milk for £1, the same as Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda. That is only slightly more than Lidl and Aldi, which both charge 95p.

The Grocer’s latest ‘shopping basket survey’ found Lidl charged 29.5 per cent less than Tesco for 33 popular lines. 

A weekly shop at Lidl cost £49.23, compared with £57.83 at Morrisons, £59.95 at Asda, £63.73 at Tesco, £64.50 at Sainsbury’s and £71.84 at Waitrose.

Only three Lidl products could be found for less elsewhere – Chicago Town pizza and Laughing Cow cheese at Morrisons, and cauliflower at Asda.

Lidl charged 89p for six free-range eggs, compared with £1 at the second cheapest store. A 1kg bag of Lidl garden peas cost 99p, while the closest rival store, Asda, charged £1.38.

Crucially, Lidl also scored 78 out of 100 for customer service at its High Wycombe store in Buckinghamshire, just one point behind the week’s winner, the Tesco Extra in Streatham, South London. 

Lidl came level with Waitrose and beat Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s.

Ronan Hegarty, of The Grocer, said: ‘It’s not a huge surprise Lidl is cheaper but the interesting thing is they are ranking highly for customer service.

‘The big chains now have to up their game.’

Mr Hegarty said Lidl and Aldi keep prices low by using simple supply chains and doing without expensive store fittings.

He added: ‘The days of Tesco having 30 per cent plus of market share are long gone. There is too much competition.’ 

Lidl had 27 exclusively cheapest items out of the 33 included in the  comparison, including bread and grapes

Waitrose has announced that it will be cutting the price of milk to £1 for four pints of its own-label brand

John Coll, of analysts Kantar Worldpanel, said: ‘I don’t think the price war has ever gone away but I’d expect it to become more pointed in the coming months. 

'It’s a very difficult environment for the big supermarkets at present, with very little inflation in groceries.’

Lidl said: ‘We are proud to be able to offer an enjoyable experience to our customers.’

Waitrose and Tesco have both cut the price of four pints of milk to £1. Farmers’ representatives warned the move has hit sales at independent stores.

They urged chains not to cut the amount paid to farmers, up to 20p a pint. 

Waitrose said: ‘We work closely with our farmers, who help determine and are paid a leading price which takes into account cost of production.’
