David Cameron last night urged Britain to shake off the spectre of the Iraq war and back potentially years of RAF strikes against the ‘psychopathic murderers’ of Islamic State.

MPs have been scrambled for an emergency recall of Parliament tomorrow to sanction bombing raids on terrorist positions in northern Iraq.

All three party leaders indicated support for air strikes, and the attacks are expected to begin as early as tomorrow night.

But the Prime Minister said the fight against Islamic terrorism could last for years.

Mr Cameron, who last night held talks with Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi to finalise military plans, stressed that British troops would not be sent back to Iraq.

The world stage: Prime Minister David Cameron  speaks at the 69th United Nations General Assembly in New York City yesterday, where he called on his fellow national leaders to join in the campaign against Islamist extremism from Iraq and Syria to Yemen, Libya and Nigeria

And he said that any bombing raids on IS forces in Syria would have to be subject to a separate vote in Parliament.

In a speech to the United Nations general assembly in New York, Mr Cameron acknowledged the long shadow cast by the disastrous legacy of the 2003 Iraq war, which left the region in near anarchy - and, some say, sowed the seeds of the rise of Islamic State.

But he said it was vital to 'learn the right lessons - Yes to careful preparation; no to rushing to join a conflict without a clear plan'.

Mr Cameron warned: 'We must not be so frozen with fear that we don't do anything at all.

'Isolation and withdrawing from a problem like Isil will only make things worse.

'We must not allow past mistakes to become an excuse for indifference or inaction.'

Action against IS should be 'comprehensive, intelligent and inclusive', working with partners in the region, potentially including Iran - whose president Hassan Rouhani he met for historic talks at the UN.

And he added: 'We should be uncompromising, using all the means at our disposal - including military force - to hunt down these extremists.'

The struggle with extremism must be waged not only against IS in Iraq and Syria, but also against Boko Haram in Nigeria, Al-Shabaab in Somalia, Ansar Al-Sharia in Libya and al-Qaida in Yemen, Mr Cameron said.

While the threat would not be best solved by Western ground troops 'directly trying to pacify or reconstruct Middle Eastern or African countries', there was a place for the military in training, advising and supporting humanitarian missions, as well as in responding to the Iraqi government's request to the UN for support.

'My message today is simple,' he told the UN. 'We are facing an evil against which the whole world must unite. And, as ever in the cause of freedom, democracy and justice, Britain will play its part.'

Ahead of his speech he told reporters: ‘This is completely different to 2003. Everyone can see that Isil (IS) is a direct threat to the UK. They have taken hostages, they have conducted plots to kill and maim British citizens. They are a clear and present danger to the United Kingdom. They are also clearly a massive danger to the region.

‘So this organisation is a direct threat. We need to be part of a comprehensive strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy it. It’s right that Britain plays our part in that. ‘This is going to take time, there’s no doubt about that, but it’s right to be part of this action. The Iraqi government has requested it and we have capabilities that are needed for it and so it’s the right thing to do.’

IS has murdered three Western hostages in recent weeks and is now threatening to kill kidnapped British taxi driver Alan Henning.

Some relatives of Mr Henning have warned this week that air strikes could reduce the hopes of ever seeing him alive again.

Mr Cameron acknowledged their plight, but insisted Britain now had to take the fight to IS.

He said: ‘It’s a desperate situation but let’s be clear about two things.

‘One is that we are dealing with psychopathic murderous brutal people who will stop at nothing to carry out dreadful acts on these hostages.

‘And secondly, it’s very important that we do the right thing as a country and we stick to the path that we set out about having a comprehensive strategy including all the elements at our disposal – humanitarian aid, diplomacy and also where appropriate military action.’

The Prime Minister said Britain would never give up the hunt for Jihadi John, the British extremist thought to have beheaded three hostages. Asked if he wanted him to face justice in a British court, a visibly angry Mr Cameron said: ‘I’m not sure I can describe in words what I’d like to happen to him, but I’m not going to say any more about it. He should see justice one way or another.’

He backed US and Arab air strikes against IS in Syria but said Britain would not be joining in at this stage.

The wife of British hostage Alan Henning last night thanked wellwishers for their support as more than 150 people attended a multi-faith peace vigil in Bolton to pray for his release.

A statement from Barbara Henning was read to the crowd by her husband’s friend Sadir Jameel, who described the taxi driver as ‘like a brother to me’.

It read: ‘We are very grateful for your support and kind words at this difficult time. I ask you all to pray for Alan and all the other people unfairly imprisoned worldwide.’

Muslim, Christian and Hindu faith leaders all called for Mr Henning’s release. Sabir Khan, of the Bolton Council of Mosques, said the Muslim community ‘unreservedly and absolutely condemned’ both his kidnap and the recent murder of Briton David Haines.

Last night it appeared Mr Cameron had sufficient support in Parliament to win a vote on military strikes tomorrow – meaning Britain will be at war by the weekend.

Labour leader Ed Miliband held an emergency meeting of his shadow cabinet at the party’s annual conference in Manchester, and spoke by telephone to the Prime Minister.

He indicated that his party, which inflicted a humiliating defeat on Mr Cameron last year when it pulled its support for military strikes in Syria, is ready to back action in Iraq.

But to the anger of some Conservative MPs, he said joining the US in hitting Syria, where IS is thought to be holding Mr Henning, would need to be approved by a UN Security Council resolution – something that is politically impossible given the opposition of Russia and China. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said his party backed the air strikes because they were requested by the Iraqis.

Mr Cameron also held talks with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani – the first face-to-face talks between the leaders of the two countries since the Iranian revolution in 1979.

Air raids eliminate top terrorist in Syria... and Obama promises to end 'the network of death' 

Islamic State’s ‘network of death’ will be destroyed by military force, Barack Obama vowed yesterday.

Warning jihadis to leave the battlefield, the US president said the terror group understood only violence. ‘No God condones this terror. No grievance justifies these actions. There can be no reasoning – no negotiation – with this brand of evil,’ he told the UN.

‘The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force. So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death.’

The president spoke after a second night of air strikes on Syria destroyed IS weapons caches and infrastructure. US officials said they believed one of the world’s most wanted terrorists was killed in the first wave of attacks.

Muhsin Al Fadhli was said to have died with 50 fellow members of his Al Qaeda-affiliated Khorasan Group at a training camp near Aleppo in Syria. The Pentagon said the group was nearing the ‘execution phase’ of an attack in Europe or America, probably against airports and passenger planes.

The aerial bombardment has been carried out with support from Arab nations including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain and Qatar.

IS has seized a huge swathe of Syria and Iraq, forcing entire communities to flee in terror.

The threat has drawn the Obama presidency back into conflicts in the Middle East which he had sought to avoid after Washington’s lengthy involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq.

His officials have said the aerial campaign could last for years.

‘In this effort, we do not act alone. Nor do we intend to send US troops to occupy foreign lands,’ the president said. ‘Instead, we will support Iraqis and Syrians fighting to reclaim their communities. We will use our military might in a campaign of air strikes to roll back Isil (IS). We will train and equip forces fighting against these terrorists on the ground.

‘We will work to cut off their financing and to stop the flow of fighters into and out of the region. Already over 40 nations have offered to join this coalition.

‘Today, I ask the world to join in this effort.’

Mr Obama recounted IS atrocities against women and religious minorities in Iraq and Syria and beheadings of hostages.
