'Big hoax': David Morrison, a senior scientist and astrobiologist at NASA's Ames Research Centre, appears in the short film to dispel doomsday rumours

Nasa tried to calm fears that doomsday is due at some point today with the release of a second video of a senior scientist dispelling the various rumours of impending apocalypse.

There are fears that the end of the Mayan long count calendar, which some experts say comes today, signals the end of the world.

David Morrison, a senior scientist and astrobiologist at NASA's Ames Research Centre, appears in the short film to reiterate the agency's belief that the rumours are just a 'big hoax'.

It is the second video this month Nasa has released in an effort to calm fears, after it was accused of tempting fate by releasing a film dubbed Why The World Didn't End Yesterday - ten days early.

However, that Nasa has seen fit to ask one of its most esteemed and learned scientists to answer the rumours shows the agency is taking seriously the possibility of mass panic.

Dr Morrison says: 'Nasa has received thousands of emails and calls from members of the public who are concerned, especially young people, so it seems only right that Nasa scientists should help to dispel these rumours.'

Chief among the rumours spinning across the internet is that the end of the world has been predicted by the Mayan long count calendar, which apparently completes its cycle today.

'That's simply not true,' Dr Morrison says. 'That's a modern rumour, it has nothing to do with the real Maya.'

Coming to an end today: The Mayan long count calendar

Astronomical and planetary experts from the U.S. space agency explained away all the myths surrounding the end of the Mayan calender - particularly that a rogue planet was due to hit the Earth

Another widely held fear is that a 
rogue planet known as Niburu or Planet X is headed for a collision 
course with Earth, and that the impact will completely wipe out human 
civilisation and, probably, everything else.

Dr Morrison calls the rumour 'silly' 
pointing out that if such a planet were on headed for an impact with our
own world 'anyone could see it'.

'It would be one of the brightest things in the sky,' he adds.

Less apocalyptic, but still 
catastrophic, are the fears that the Earth's rotation is set to change 
and the poles will flip, doing massive damage to our habitats and 
civilisation.

But Dr Morrison says 'this just can't happen', adding that there is 'no way' the Earth's poles could flip.

The video from NASA makes the point that if a rogue planet or asteroid was about to hit the Earth we would already be able to see it with our bare eyes

Ancient Mayans believed that a 5,125-year cycle known as the Long Count would come to a close on December 21 2012.

Experts estimate the system, which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns, started counting at 3114 BC, and will have run through 13 baktuns, or 5,125 years, around December 21.

They say 13 was a significant number for the Maya, and the end of that cycle would be a milestone â€” but they have been keen to stress that it does not mark an end.

Conspiracy theorists nonetheless believe the Maya may have been privy to impending astronomical disasters that would coincide with 2012, ranging from explosive storms on the surface of the sun that could knock out power grids to a galactic alignment that could trigger a reversal in Earth's magnetic field.

He goes on to discount rumours that a 
planetary alignment will occur, since the planets are currently 'all 
over the sky', and we are set to be gobbled up by a massive black hole, 
which, he says, astronomers know is 'impossible'.

To those whose fears have been exacerbated by the belief that the number of natural disasters is increasing across the planet, Dr Morrison says 'the frequency of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions is not greater now than any time in the past.'

He also dispels a more recent internet rumour that Nasa has confirmed that there will be three days of total darkness beginning from tomorrow.

'Nasa didn't say that, nobody said it,' he says. 'It's just one more crazy idea.'

The video was published on Tuesday, 
just five days after the agency indicated it was so confident the 
apocalypse was going to happen today it released a video entitled Why 
The World Didn't End Yesterday.

Like Dr Morrison's video, it outlined 
point by point the myths surrounding the end of the Mayan calendar with 
astronomical and planetary experts answering them.

'If you are watching this video then 
that means one thing...the world didn't end yesterday,' began the 
prematurely released video.

The end-of-days prophesy is based on 
an interpretation of the ancient Mayan calendar which claims the world 
will end on December 21 2012.
