Nigel Farage is using a private company which could halve the tax bill on his media appearances, it can be revealed.

The Ukip leader funnels money from appearances in the media and on the lecture circuit into a firm called Thorn In The Side Ltd.

It means that last year he paid only 20 per cent corporation tax on profits of £45,000, instead of 40 per cent income tax. Tonight he faced calls to do the ‘patriotic thing’ and pay full tax like everyone else.

The revelation risks leaving him open to allegations of hypocrisy, having previously criticised people who try to avoid tax as the ‘common enemy’.

The details of his tax affairs emerged ahead of his live TV debate with Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg tonight on BBC2 at 7pm.

The use of personal service companies is not illegal, but has been criticised across the political spectrum as a way to reduce tax bills.

Companies House records show that in 2012-13 Thorn In The Side Limited made a profit of £45,488.

If this had been declared as income he would have paid £21,883.03 in 40 per cent income tax and national insurance.

But by using Thorn In The Side as a personal service company, he will have only paid £9,097.60 in corporation tax, and a further £1,687.50 on a £7,500 he took as a dividend, taxed at 22.5 per cent.

This will have presented a saving of £11,097.93 on an income tax bill.

Mr Farage could then draw the money out as income more slowly, limiting his tax liability. He would be taxed on the money when he draws it later.

He used to declare outside earnings on his register of members interests for journalism of €500- €1,000 and lecturing fees of €1,001- €5,000 a month.

It is not clear what Mr Farage is actually paid for, but he regularly appears on TV and radio and writes in newspapers, although not all publications pay for articles.

But the latest entry shows that he is director of Thorn In The Side Limited, where he now pays his outside earnings.

As an MEP Mr Farage also earns £78,000-a-year from Brussels and employs his wife Kirsten on the taxpayer, on a salary of up to £20,000.

Details of his expense claims are unclear, but in January the Sunday Mirror said he received  £61,065 in allowances for six months.

In a speech last year, he took aim at ‘a common enemy - rich people, successful companies evading tax which of course is a problem’.

Today Labour MP John Mann said: ‘He should do the patriotic thing and pay full British tax like everybody else. It is the same old tired politicians.

‘He is as bad as the rest of them. He is part of that freeloading rich minority. The patriotic thing would be to pay your British taxes and stop tax dodging.’

Thorn In The Side Ltd was incorporated in 2011 and Mr Farage is the only director, owning 100 per cent of shares.

It is registered at the address of Buckley Watson Accountants in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex.

Last year Mr Farage was branded a 'hypocrite' after admitting he opened an offshore trust fund to slash his tax bill while campaigning against tax avoidance.

He set up a scheme on the Isle of Man for ‘inheritance purposes’ but later he claimed he never used it, adding: ‘It was a mistake. I’m not rich enough.’

In the 2012 London Mayoral race Labour’s Ken Livingstone was criticised for using a personal service company after declaring: ‘No one should be allowed to vote in a British election, let alone sit in Parliament, unless they pay their full share of tax.’

The BBC has also come under fire for allowing star presenters to have their wages paid into such companies, which means they end up paying less tax.

The off-the-books arrangements create ‘suspicions of complicity in tax avoidance’, according to Commons spending watchdog Margaret Hodge.

MailOnline contacted Ukip before publication but there has so far been no response.
