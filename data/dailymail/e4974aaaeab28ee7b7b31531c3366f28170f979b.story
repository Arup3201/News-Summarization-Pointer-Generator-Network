Mark Carney’s move from Canada to  London cost the Bank of England nearly £200,000 – making him Britain’s first  £1million Governor.

The cost of relocating the former Goldman Sachs banker and his family – including flights, temporary accommodation, and shipping costs – was £102,816.

The Bank also forked out £95,846 in tax related to the cost of the move, taking the total to £198,662, according to the central bank’s annual report published yesterday.

Superstar: The Bank of England has spent £1 million employing its new governor Mark Carney, according to figures released days after he attacked the City for giving extortionate bonuses to 'superstars'

Hand-picked: Mr Carney (right with George Osborne and the Lord Mayor of the City of London Fiona Woolf) was hand-picked by the Chancellor after guiding Canada's economy to stability following the crash

Mr Carney’s relocation package – on 
top of annual earnings of £874,000 including a £250,000 housing 
allowance – takes the total for his first year in charge to more than 
£1million. It far outstrips the £309,297 his predecessor Lord King 
earned.

Revelations about Mr Carney’s package 
come weeks after he warned that huge rewards for ‘superstar’ bankers are
 causing inequality around the world.

It comes weeks after Mr Carney turned his fire on City greed and the problem of growing inequality.

He said globalisation had resulted in huge earnings which were 'amplifying the rewards of the superstar'.

And in January, the Bank of England said it was planning to cut up to 100 jobs following a 'value for money' review.

Mark Carney receives a basic salary of £480,000 - up from Mervyn King's £300,000.

The Canadian then receives £250,000 accommodation allowance.

With a 30 per cent pension contribution, the total reaches £870,000.

And flying the 48-year-old over with his wife and children cost Britain £100,000 plus another £100,000 in tax.

Mr Carney was hand-picked for the role by George Osborne after helping the Canadian economy recover faster from the downturn than any other developed major nation.

He beat some of Britain's leading executives to the job despite insisting he will only serve five years - rather than eight, to reduce disruption to his children.

It was his track record that prompted Mr Osborne to overlook favourites including Bank veteran Paul Tucker and Adair Turner, the former chairman of the City watchdog.

Figures show Mr Osborne's decision cost the Bank £102,816 to relocating the superstar banker and his family to London, while also paying a tax liability of £95,846.

The report today said: 'It is the Bank’s policy to relocate those appointed to senior positions as necessary, and to incur the costs of doing so.

'In line with this policy, the Bank relocated Mr Carney and his family from Ottawa to London. Procurement decisions in that process were taken by the Bank.'

The Bank said it decided Mr Carney's salary through a remuneration committee, which takes account of salaries available elsewhere and how this 'might affect the availability of good candidates'.

Its accommodation allowance for Mr Carney reflects 'the additional cost of living in London rather than in Ottawa'.

His predecessor Lord King received a total package of £309,297 for the full-year 2012/2013, the report showed, and £215,021 for the start of 2013/14.

However, unlike Mr Carney he was eligible for the Bank’s old Court pension scheme, where benefits were 'significantly higher', a spokeswoman said.

Mr Carney’s total remuneration for the eight months he was in charge for 2013/14 was £586,010.

The report also disclosed for the first time that the governor has chosen to enrol in the Bank’s pension scheme rather than take a payment in lieu of this benefit.

Beneath the highest echelons of the bank, it employs 632 staff on £80,000 or more, including 330 on £100,000 or more and four on £200,000 or more.
