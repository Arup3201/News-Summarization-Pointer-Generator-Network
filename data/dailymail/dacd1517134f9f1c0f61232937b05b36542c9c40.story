Theresa May today echoed Margaret Thatcher with a stark rallying cry to Tory activists to defend British values from Islamist extremism.

The Home Secretary said the country needed to ‘face down extremism in all its forms’ in the wake of the murder of British hostage David Haines by a UK-linked ISIS terrorist.

She said: ‘We must stand up for our values. Because, in the end, as they have done before, those values, our British values, will win the day, and we will prevail.’

The remarks are reminiscent of Mrs Thatcher’s famous address to the Tory conference in 1984 after the Brighton bomb attack.

Home Secretary Theresa May said British values would 'prevail' in the fight against Islamist extremists

Mrs Thatcher said the threat Britain faced from the IRA was ‘probably the most testing crisis of our time - the battle between the extremists and the rest’.

She told the Conservative conference: 'We are fighting, as we have always fought, for the weak as well as for the strong. We are fighting for great and good causes.

'We are fighting to defend them against the power and might of those who rise up to challenge them. 'This Government will not weaken. This nation will meet that challenge. Democracy will prevail.'

Mrs May’s speech today – 30 years after Mrs Thatcher’s – sparked huge cheers in the conference hall.

She also hit out at stop and search laws and the ‘outrageous irresponsibility’ of Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg in blocking greater surveillance powers for the police and security services. 

The Home Secretary – tipped as a future Tory leader – said fundamentalists rejected British and Western values, including democracy, the rule of law, and equality between citizens.

She said: ‘They believe that it is impossible to be a good Muslim and a good British citizen. And they dismiss anybody who disagrees with them - including other Muslims - as non-believers.

The Home Secretary's address this afternoon came before the London mayor Boris Johnson this afternoon

Theresa May will force through new laws to limit police stop and search powers if officers keep stopping black youngsters illegally.

The Home Secretary said abuse of stop and search was 'hugely damaging to public confidence in the police'.

She said: ‘It’s difficult for most of us here in this hall to really appreciate the effects of stop and search. You see, most of us are white. Most of us are of a certain age.

‘But imagine walking home, or driving to work one day, and being stopped by the police. Imagine, having done nothing wrong, you are patted down, you have your pockets turned inside out, and your possessions examined.

‘Imagine you ask why you’re being searched and you’re told it’s “just routine” even though the police need “reasonable grounds for suspicion” that you’ve broken the law.

‘Imagine growing up and the indignity of this happening to you twenty, thirty, forty, even fifty or sixty times. And imagine what it’s like to feel, deep down, that this is only happening because you’re young, male and black.’

Mrs May said it the abuse does not stop should would pass new laws to make it happen.

‘This hateful ideology has nothing to do with Islam itself. And it is rejected by the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Britain and around the world.

‘So let the message go out from this hall that the extremists will never succeed in dividing us. Let the message go out that we know Islam is a religion of peace and it has nothing to do with the ideology of our enemies.’

Mrs May’s day had begun with controversy over her plans to ban preachers of hate from attending public meetings or spreading their bile on Twitter.

Civil liberties groups accused her of infringing free speech. But she shrugged off the criticism to warn of the perils of not confronting Islamic extremism in the UK.

She said fundamentalists rejected British and Western values, including democracy, the rule of law, and equality.

Mrs May pledged to ‘undermine and eliminate extremism in all its forms’. She said: ‘Across the country, there are concerns about the way Shari’ah law is being applied, the way women are told to live and the intolerant attitudes shown to people of different beliefs and ways of life.

‘We must not sleepwalk into separation, segregation and sectarianism.

‘We must be clear to people that the United Kingdom is a great place to live. We choose to live here, immigrants come to live here, and many dream of building a life here because we have a free society.

‘We celebrate different ways of life, we value diversity, and we cherish our freedom to lead our lives as we choose.

‘All British people – including British Muslims – are free to practise their faith, and wear whatever clothes they choose. They are free to establish their own faith schools and give their children - including their girls – the best education possible.’

But she added: ‘You don’t just get the freedom to live how you choose to live. You have to respect other people’s right to do so too.

‘And you have to respect British values and institutions. The rule of law. Democracy. Equality. Free speech. And respect for minorities. These are the values that make our country what it is. These are our values. There is no place for extremism here.’

She said Britain was not a ‘moral vacuum’, adding: ‘We have to stand up for our values as a nation.’

Mrs May ended her speech with a triumphant declaration that British values would 'prevail' against extremists

Mrs May's speech clearly resembled the former Prime Minister's 1984 address to the Conservative Party conference after the 1984 Brighton bomb

'The nation faces what is probably the most testing crisis of our time, the battle between the extremists and the rest. We are fighting, as we have always fought, for the weak as well as for the strong.

'We are fighting for great and good causes. We are fighting to defend them against the power and might of those who rise up to challenge them. This Government will not weaken. This nation will meet that challenge. Democracy will prevail.' 

'We know the overwhelming majority of British people want to be free. Free from danger. Free from fear. Free from prejudice. Free from discrimination. Free to practise their religion... Free to get on with their lives.

'We must confront segregation and sectarianism. We must face down extremism in all its forms. We must stand up for our values. Because, in the end, as they have done before, those values, our British values, will win the day, and we will prevail.'

Mr May added that the ‘overwhelming majority of British people want to be free’, adding that the UK must not become a country where this is no longer possible.

Mrs May added: ‘We must confront segregation and sectarianism. We must face down extremism in all its forms.

‘We must stand up for our values. Because, in the end, as they have done before, those values, our British values, will win the day, and we will prevail.’

In 1984, after the Brighton Bomb attack, Mrs Thatcher said the country was in a 'battle to uphold the rule of law'.

She said this demanded 'the resolve and commitment of the British people'.

ISIS terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons to attack the West, Theresa May warned today.

The Home Secretary said the terror organisation, which has carved out vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria, posed a direct threat to Britain.

She said: ‘They have made clear that they want to go on attacking Western targets. That is why it’s right that we are part of the international coalition dedicated to ISIL’s destruction.’

The Home Secretary's address today enhanced her growing reputation within the Conservative Party

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling attacked 'crazy' human rights judgments, in his set-piece speech at the Tory conference today.

The Cabinet minister said reforms to human rights laws would be introduced ‘shortly’, suggesting the plan may be announced by the Prime Minister tomorrow.

Mr Grayling had been expected to unveil the Tory plan for a British bill of rights to replace Labour’s human rights act. 

He said: ‘It is crazy that someone who poses a terrorist threat to this country should be able to claim their human rights to stay here. 

'It is unacceptable that human rights laws should back those who break our immigration and planning rules, and yet all too often ignore the rights of our own people.’

He said Britain should not be told to give prisoners the vote ‘by an international court accountable to no one in this country’. 

Mrs May added: ‘If ISIL succeed in firmly consolidating their grip on the land they occupy in Syria and Iraq, we will see the world’s first truly terrorist state established within a few hours flying time of our country.

‘We will see terrorists given the space to plot attacks against us, train their men and women, and devise new methods to kill indiscriminately.

‘We will see the risk, often prophesied but thank God not yet fulfilled, that with the capability of a state behind them, the terrorists will acquire chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons to attack us. This is not somebody else’s battle.

‘They have made clear their ambitions. And they have made us their enemies. ‘

Mr May said enemies should be taken at their word that they want to attack us.

But she added: ‘We must not flinch. We must not shy away from our responsibility. We must not drift towards danger and insecurity. While we still have the chance, we must act to destroy ISIL.’

The Home Secretary said ‘at least’ 500 British nationals had gone to Syria and Iraq – including the suspected killers of those who murdered David Haines.

She said in the case of ISIL the danger was ‘clear’. Mrs May said: ‘They have already murdered British and American citizens in the most brutal and cowardly manner possible.’
