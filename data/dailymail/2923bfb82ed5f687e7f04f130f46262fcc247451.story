A surveillance image of a 'person of interest' in connection with a bank robbery where a policeman was shot dead has been released.

The grainy picture, issued on Thursday as part of a nationwide manhunt, shows a man in a hoodie at a convenience store minutes before the armed robbery on December 23 in Tupelo, Mississippi. 

A desperate search involving the FBI is underway as police in Chicago were placed on high alert following reports the gunman may have fled to the city.

Father-of-two Corporal Kevin Gale Stauffer, 38, was shot dead when he tried to stop suspects in a car as they waited at a level crossing.

At least one of the gang shot Cpl Stauffer at close range from inside the vehicle before driving off.

Fellow officer, Joseph Maher, 27, was also shot and remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

Cpl Stauffer is due to be buried today with military and law enforcement honors.

Detectives increased the reward from $152,000 to $162,500 for information that can help them catch the suspects who are believed to have robbed BancorpSouth bank in Tupelo.

Authorities warned that the heavily-armed suspects could also have fled to either Alabama or Arkansas. 

One suspect being sought is a thin, possibly African-American man with light complexion, between 5ft 9in and 6in, according to Mississippi Department of Public Safety.

CCTV footage, which has been released to the public, shows one of the suspects in a convenience store wearing khaki trousers, white Converse trainers, a long-sleeved jacket and a blue ski mask.

The robbers are thought to have been driving a dark grey sedan.

A team of more than 100 law enforcement staff worked over Christmas Day and Boxing Day to trace the gang.

On Christmas Day, a candlelit vigil was held in the town centre for Mr Stauffer, a combat veteran of the Louisiana Army National Guard with whom he served a tour in Iraq.

Tupelo Mayor Jason Shelton praised Cpl Stauffer, who 'made the ultimate sacrifice for his community'.

Grieving wife Beth Stauffer told WTVA-TV: 'I have my moments. But, I'm at peace with Gale because I know he died doing something he loved.

'The way he was at work as a leader is what he was like at home.'

His mother, Debbie Brangenberg, thanked
 the dozens that attended the memorial service on Wednesday, saying the 
strength of the community keeps the family strong.

She added: 'Everybody has been so wonderful to us through this week.

'And, the overwhelming love and support that this community has given us has helped us make it through.'

Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre spoke at the vigil, praising Cpl Stauffer, who worked for the department for eight years. The FBI set a reward for information from $152,000 to $162,500
