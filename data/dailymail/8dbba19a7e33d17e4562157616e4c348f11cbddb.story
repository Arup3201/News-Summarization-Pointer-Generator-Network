A five-month-old baby suffering from flat head syndrome must wear a £2,000 specialist helmet every day for up to six months to help correct his misshapen skull.

Oakley Porter-Mcaveeney, from Coventry, suffers from brachycephaly – a rare condition which is better known as flat head syndrome - and has to wear the special helmet to remould his skull.

His mother Stephanie Mcaveeney, 28, first noticed her son's unusual condition when he was just eight-weeks-old but was told treatment to rectify his head shape was not available on the NHS.

The five-month-old baby has 'one of the worst examples' of the condition ever seen (left) but doctors said treatment was not available on the NHS. Ms Mcaveeney put out an appeal on Facebook for donations to help

Doctors told Ms Mcaveeney, a stay-at-home mother, that it was the worst case of the condition they had ever seen  but admitted that she would have to fork out £2,000 to buy the specialist helmet.

However, after posting her story on Facebook, donations piled in and she was able to afford the helmet.

Young Oakley now wears the hard hat – which is designed with his name on the front - for 23 hours every day.

Ms Mcaveeney said: 'He's adapted to life with the helmet really well.

'Oakley is only five-months-old so he's just taken it all in his stride and seems to be as happy as ever.

'I can already see an improvement and it's now just a matter of waiting for the helmet to work its magic.

'He will have to be reviewed every two weeks and it could take between four to six months to fully correct the shape of his skull.

It is hoped that after he has worn it every day for six months, his skull will be remoulded to the correct shape

'I'm very confident my lovely little boy will be okay now. It's a wonderful feeling knowing that he's receiving the correct treatment and I can't thank the people who've donated enough.'

Oakley will wear the helmet for 23 hours each day for up to six months to counteract his flat head.

Brachycephaly is caused when part of a baby's head becomes flattened due to continued pressure on one spot and can also affect the jaw and ear alignment.

In extreme cases it can affect speech and hearing.

Ms Mcaveeney added: 'It was emotional to see the helmet finally being fitted. All the research I have looked through says that this is the best thing for him.

'At first I thought this was a cosmetic issue but it didn't take a lot of research to realise that it's far more serious than that. I'm delighted that Oakley will be OK now.

'He's adapted to the change really well and is happy taking naps in it.

'Oakley's a little star and I couldn't be any more proud of him.'
