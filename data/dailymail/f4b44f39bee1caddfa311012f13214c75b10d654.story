Behind bars: Rodney Bruce Black, 62, of Barboursville, West Virginia was arrested after shooting two of his new neighbors Saturday

A 62-year-old West Virginia man shot dead two new neighbors without warning while they were surveying their property next door on Saturday.

Rodney Bruce Black, 62, is now being charged with two counts of first degree murder for killing brothers Garrick and Carl Hopkins Jr, 60 and 61, but he says he was just protecting his own property from burglars.

Black said the two men were trying to break into his tool shed around 2:30pm when he grabbed his rifle and shot them without warning from inside his house.

According to pictures of Black's house on Google maps, it seems there are two sheds near his back yard, about 70 - 80 feet away.

Police on the other hand, say the two men were firmly on their own property trying to get into their own tool shed, though the Black family had at one point owned that stretch of land.There was nothing belonging to Black inside the shed or worth value for that matter.

They say Black only called 911 after fatally injuring both men and he didn't attempt to perform first-aid.

Black was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time, leaving Cabell County Sheriff's struggling to find a motive in the attack.

'It's just a terrible, terrible tragedy,' Sheriff Tom McComas told the New York Daily News. 'We're still trying to figure all of this out. … Hopefully we'll find out his reasoning as the investigation continues.'

While Black is white and the Hopkins brothers are black, police don't believe the attack was racially-

Garrick Hopkins was from Milton, West Virginia and had recently bought the plot next to Black's home at 12 Lane Drive.

Hopkins had taken his brother there on Saturday to show him where he planned to build a new home for his family. Both men were married and had children.

When police arrived on the scene and arrested Black, they seized a large number of weapons and ammunition.

Black is being held without bond at Western Regional Jail. His first preliminary hearing is set for February 4.
