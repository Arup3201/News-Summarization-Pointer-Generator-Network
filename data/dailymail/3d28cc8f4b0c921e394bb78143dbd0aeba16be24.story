People often play at naming children way before they even conceive a baby and now, thanks to Twitter, the game just got more fun.

A recent trending topic using the hashtag #uglybabynames, has set the social networking site on fire with amused users eager to share their ideas of the most unfortunate names parents could call their offspring.

Suggestions range from old-fashioned monikers like Phyliss and Ronald to the more obscure Tyquasia, Sausagea (pronounced Saw-sage-uh according to the tweet) and Nevaeh which is 'heaven' backwards.

The name game: Twitter users voted Blue Ivy, Beyonce and Jay-Z's baby's name (left), and 'whatever Snooki calls her child' (right) among ugliest baby names

Beyonce Knowles and Jay-Z may not be as entertained by the list, that Babble.com rounded up alphabetically, seeing as Blue Ivy featured a number of times.

A blogger on Babble's Strollerderby blog published a summary, keeping faithful to the website's mission statement that recognizes parenting as: 'Rapturous, backbreaking and hysterically funny.'

You ugly: Blue Ivy features on Babble.com's round-up of the list

Not included in the US-based parenting website's list was the popular idea that whatever name 
reality star Snooki chooses for her baby, will win the prize for the 
ugliest.

Perhaps the most inventive is La-a which is pronounced, La-dash-a, according to a user named Girl's Got Issues who explains: 'The dash don't be silent.'

Some Twitter enthusiasts aren't impressed by the idea of calling out ugly names however.

A few have responded to the trend by sticking up for the babies themselves and saying that they're all beautiful no matter what they're called.

No doubt they would have something to say to one user who claims all babies are 'useless' and therefore the concept of the trending topic is similarly pointless.

Interestingly Babble has erred from listing any of the alternative, bohemian names that are popular nowadays among young, cosmopolitan parents but that some users claimed were their least favourite.

Names like Autumn and Apple were included in the tweets but left off the round up by the award-winning parenting resource.

Perhaps this is no surprise given the names of the founders' own children. Alisa Volkman and Rufus Griscom have three sons together, named Declan, Grey and Rye.
