A quick-thinking police officer who saved a baby girl from choking to death 20 years ago has attended her wedding.

Shammarah Hamideh, 20, calls Sergeant Joseph Barca her 'second father' after he revived her in her Yonkers, New York, home in December 1993 when she was just two months old.

Barca has never missed Hamideh's birthday. On Sunday, he watched her walk down the aisle.

Moving: New York Sergeant Joseph Barca (right) said he was elated to attend the wedding of Shammarah Hamideh, 20, in Chicago on Sunday. Barca saved Hamideh's life when she was just two-months-old and they have been close ever since

Barca, from Buffalo, said he knew he had to attend when he was invited to the wedding.

'I said, 'Not my little baby! Of course I'll be there!'' Barca told CBS.

In his 45-year career with Yonkers Police, Barca has saved dozens of lives and rescued victims trapped in the World Trade Center after the 9/11 attacks.

But he said saving Hamideh's life changed his.

'This one ranks up on top, and I go out there for a reason, and the reason is to help people,' he said.

'Her father over the years has always referred to me as her American dad. The family is Palestinian,' Barca told 1010 WINS.

'He said he gave her life the first time, and I gave her life the second time.'

On December 28, 1993, Hamideh's father, Mahmoud, called 911 when his baby stopped breathing and went limp.Â 

Barca was the first to respond.

Outside the family's Linden Street apartment building, Barca found Mahmoud crying and holding his lifeless daughter in his arms.

Barca attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but knew air wasn't reaching the baby's lungs.

He flipped her over and hit her on the back sharply three or four times before a wad of mucous flew out of her mouth.

Barca then continued resuscitation until the ambulance arrived. By the time Hamideh reached the hospital, she was breathing on her own again.

'The father showed up expecting to hear the worst,' Barca told the Journal News. 'I said, "You hear that baby crying? That's yours." Then he started crying.'

That
 life-saving moment which made national headlines has forever bonded Barca to Hamideh.

He calls her the daughter he never had. Barca and his wife 
Helen have three adult children, a school teacher and two police 
officers.

'Every year they have never missed my birthday,' Hamideh told CBS

'And for Christmas they always send a card and a check and a letter. They're just so sweet. It's the thought that counts really.'

Hamideh, who studied nursing, plans to find a job in Chicago where she will live with her new husband, truck driver Mohammed Salah.

Barca plans to retire from the force this fall.
