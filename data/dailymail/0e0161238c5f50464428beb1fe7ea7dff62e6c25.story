Ben Foden has a point to make this season. It’s about what he stands for and what matters to him: sport, not showbusiness. And it’s about a hunger to reclaim lost status.

The Northampton full back will be eased into the new Aviva Premiership season on Friday night when he is among the Saints’ replacements for the visit of Gloucester.

That is the upshot of a minor ankle injury which disrupted the final stages of his pre-season. Yet once he does enter the fray, he will set about his personal mission with renewed purpose.

Goal: Northampton full back Ben Foden is determined to claim back the England No 15 jersey this season

Foden senses the doubts about his motivation, from those who matter and others who don’t. There is a nagging perception in some quarters that, with his pop-star wife, Una, and attendant celebrity profile, this is a player for whom the primary focus in life has shifted and the fires of career ambition have been partially doused.

He is at pains to set the record straight. The 29-year-old goes into the final season ahead of a home World Cup with that looming target on his radar. Work will come first and any sideshows in the long-lens gaze of the paparazzi will be kicked into touch for now.

Asked if the doubts about his hunger stem from the image of his lifestyle, Foden told Sportsmail: ‘You can understand why people think that. You can understand why Stuart Lancaster and the England coaches might think like that, too.

‘But I have always said that my rugby comes first. Whatever comes with being married to Una and all that jazz comes second.

‘I want to be known as Ben Foden the rugby player rather than Ben Foden, married to Una from The Saturdays. It is very important to me that I have my own identity in that way, and I think that I deserve that as well.

‘I’ve been in this game a long time. I have 34 caps for England, I’ve won a Premiership title, I’ve played in a Heineken Cup Final, I’ve won LV Cups and Challenge Cups. I’ve scored in a World Cup quarter-final, in a Premiership final and in a Heineken Cup final, so my credentials speak for themselves. People sometimes forget all that.’

Foden concedes that his fervent desire to force his way back into the England team might not have been fully recognised, even by the coaches. He was a fixture in the Test XV from 2010 until the summer of 2012, before injuries and the rise of Alex Goode and Mike Brown knocked him from his perch. He intends to be more vocal in emphasising his wish to fight back.

‘I think England have been a bit miffed about why I haven’t been a bit more upset about being left out,’ he said.

‘But to be brutally honest, I just didn’t feel fit and I felt that the other guys were playing better than me.

‘It’s only now that I’ve got this full pre-season under my belt that I feel like the Foden of old, so I will definitely have that conversation with Stuart to tell him, “I’m still hungry for it and I will prove it”.

‘It’s probably going to be the last World Cup I’ll have a chance to be involved in so this is going to be such a big year for me. I want to push for that spot.

Pace: Foden (centre) is renowned for his attacking running style and his ability to beat defenders from deep

Looking forward: Foden is determined that he will make the England squad for the 2015 World Cup on home soil

‘I had to force out Delon Armitage the first time to claim that No 15 shirt, when he’d been playing very well. Then I got injured, Alex Goode came in and he played very well.

‘Then when Mike Brown got his opportunity, he came in and played very well, so I think we’re all on a level playing field.

‘It will be a straight shoot-out now and will come down to who wants it more.’

Four of Foden’s last five starting Test appearances for England have been on the wing - where resources are thinner than at full back. But despite some experts suggesting he makes a wide berth his objective, he wants to play for his country in his club position.

‘When you listen to the pundits like Stuart Barnes or Will Greenwood, they’re saying, “Foden’s future lies on the wing”,’ he said.

‘I think it’s good that I can cover that position, but I see myself as an out-and-out full back.

‘I want to run out in the No 15 shirt for England again. Whoever gets that shirt ahead of me, they’re going to have to play their socks off to stop me nicking it back.’

Try time: Foden is determined to reclaim his Test No 15 spot back from Mike Brown and Alex Goode

Poised: Foden will return to action when Northampton kick off their title defence against Gloucester on Friday

Northampton v Gloucester is live on BT Sport 2 from 7pm on Friday. Kick-off 7.45pm
