A man surprised his girlfriend with the proposal of her dreams when he leapt out of Nick Saban's private bathroom  and presented her with a ring.

Drew Clayton called in a favor from Saban, football coach the University of Alabama, and planted himself in his office, where now-fiancee Kayla Posey works as a student assistant.

He swapped  the 2012 BCS National Championship ring on Saban's coffee table with Kayla's custom-made diamond, according to AL.com.

Kayla began shining the rings on the coffee table with her dress before noticing that one of them was actually her custom-made diamond ring swapped in by Drew earlier that day

In need of a hiding place, Drew took up position in Saban's bathroom while he waited to carry out the less-than-conventional proposal.

Nick Saban, who was once named the Most Powerful Coach in Sports by Forbes, previously served as head coach of the National Football League's Miami Dolphins. 

He has also coached for three other universities, including Louisiana State University, Michigan State University, and the University of Toledo.

Kayla's co-workers at Saban's office helped orchestrate the plan, and sent her out to lunch on the day of the proposal so Clayton could set up.

'One of my main jobs was giving tours of the athletic facility,' Kayla said. 'I had four tours that day, so I was all dressed up, and my co-workers told me another tour had been added at the last minute.'

Her now fiancé said: 'For 30 minutes, my stomach is churning and I'm waiting on Kayla to get back.

'It was a very well-kept bathroom, as we would expect from such a perfect coach.'

Kayla got the shock of her life when boyfriend Drew sprung out of the bathroom and dropped to one knee

While waiting for her, Drew killed time by tucking into a box of Oatmeal Creme Pies he found in the bathroom.

'I was kind of hungry, so I figured he wouldn't miss one,' he said. 

Kayla had been told that an important guest was on his way and that she needed to shine the rings in Saban's office for the occasion.

'When I got into the office, one of the national championship boxes was closed,' she said. 'I started cleaning it with my dress and I opened the box.'

Kayla said she was overwhelmed by everything Drew and her co-workers had done to pull off 'one of the greatest days of her life' -  which was all captured by a hidden camera

'I looked at it for a second, and I thought, 'That's my ring.'

Drew sprung out of his hiding place in the bathroom, dropped to one knee and asked his girlfriend if she would marry him.

The whole proposal was captured on a hidden camera Kayla's co-workers had set up in the office earlier that day.

'I know she loves Alabama and loved working in that office,' Drew said. 'It was her place, so I knew she would never expect me to be there.'

Kayla said she was overwhelmed by everything Drew and her co-workers had done to pull off 'one of the greatest days of her life'.

'I was never the kind of guy that wanted to 'go to dinner and go on a walk and then pop the question,' Drew added. 'I wanted something that was very cool, and something we could always remember.'
