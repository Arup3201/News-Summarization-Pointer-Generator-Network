Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer speaks about the Carbon Tax Repeal bill in the House of Representatives at Parliament House in Canberra on Monday

There was muted celebration in the chamber from the coalition on Monday.

Australia's Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer has vowed to give his party's backing for the repeal in the Senate after demanding amendments that ensure cost-savings are passed on to consumers.

Only gas and electricity firms and bulk suppliers of synthetic greenhouse gases face penalties of up to 250 per cent to any savings they fail to pass on.

They have 30 days to inform the consumer watchdog of how prices will be cut.

Smaller importers of items such as refrigerators, cars and air conditioners will not be affected.

The government said the changes will clarify who is covered and how business can pass on the savings.

The bills are expected in the Senate on Tuesday, Environmental Minister Greg Hunt later added on Twitter.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Mr Hunt said Australians were 'waiting on their members and senators to honour their commitment' to repeal the carbon tax when he spoke at the House of Representatives in Canberra.

'The Australian people voted in the most express, clear and absolute way to ensure that they did not have and would not have a carbon tax and they would have a government which would take real measures to reduce emissions without a carbon tax,' he said.

Mr Palmer said his party would vote to abolish the tax in the Senate.

'It's not the Labor way or the Liberal way, it's the right way that's important for Australia and the world,' he said during the debate at the lower house,' he said.

During a speech in the lower house, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be 'remembered as an environmental vandal'.

'He is sleepwalking his way into a major climate policy disaster, a disaster for the Australian economy and for our environment, a disaster that guarantees that forever Tony Abbott will be remembered as an environmental vandal,' Mr Shorten said.
