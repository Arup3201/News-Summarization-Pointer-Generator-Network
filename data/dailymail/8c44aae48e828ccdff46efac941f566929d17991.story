What do Victoria Beckham, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne and Helen Mirren have in common?

Aside from being inherently wealthy, famous, glamorous and successful women, they are all among Britain's most influential people, according to Debrett's

Debrett's, which has been recognising people of influence and achievement in British society for 250 years, has compiled its annual 500 Most Influential People, and all four women are among the movers and shakers.

Experts within a range of fields - from 
fashion and film, to sport and theatre - were asked to select 500 people they believe are making an
 impact in the country today.

Cara Delevingne, Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham joined the likes of make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury, designer of the year Christopher Kane, and Burberry Boss Christopher Bailey in the fashion ranks.

Writing about Moss, 40, Debrett's said: 'When most models have been forced into retirement, Moss's timeless image is propelling her from strength to strength as she continues to diversify her iconic look.'

And of the younger supermodel Cara Delevingne, they add: 'The effervescent Delevingne has an unprecedented global social media following with 4.2 Twitter and Instagram followers, making her one of the most influential people in the fashion world.'

Girl power: Kate Moss, left, and Dame Helen Mirren, right, were also among the most influential women on the list

Simon Cowell and Gary Barlow were given nods in the music sector, while Dame Helen Mirren was recognised for her role as the Queen in West End play
 The Audience.

Emma Thompson and Carey Mulligan warranted a mention in a very male-dominated film section, with David Beckham, Tom Daley and Jessica Ennis-Hill winning votes in the sports personality sector.

Jonathan Ross, Miranda Hart and Jack Whitehall were among the TV personalities given a mention.

'The
 Debrett's 500 is a positive endorsement and recognition of Britain's 
500 most influential people.Â 

'It has been carefully compiled by 
independent panels of specialists in each field who provided nominations
 for selection to Debrett's. A truly inspiring group of people,' said the company.

Let's hear it for the boys: David Beckham and Tom Daley were amongst the most influential sports personalities
