A college's upcoming trip to watch Millwall Football Club so sociology students can observe 'working class culture and habits' has been blasted as 'offensive' and 'stereotyping'.

Varndean College in Brighton is offering learners the chance to watch Brighton and Hove Albion take on the 'notorious' south-east London club - as well as learn about 'working class culture and habits', 'issues around sexuality, race and ethnicity' and 'women challenging gender norms'.

A poster displayed at the college also urges students to enjoy working class fare like pies and Bovril and 'even talk to fans' at their home team’s American Express Community Stadium.

It also features a newspaper article about a former Millwall football hooligan. 

TalkSPORT newsreader Robyn Schönhofer tweeted: 'The words "offensive" and "stereotyping" spring to mind.'

Jon Hatchman added: 'Varndean College using stereotypes against "working class" Millwall fans as a sociology experiment. Really not cool.' 

Pete Bailey, Head of Sociology at the college which has a 98 per cent A-level pass rate, defended the trip, claiming that the Millwall game was the only evening match around this time of year.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'As part of the AQA AS Sociology syllabus on Culture and Identity, students are expected to study the relationship of identity to gender and social class among other things, also the relationship between leisure activities and identity.

'Going to the football provides an opportunity to look at some of these things outside the classroom.'

Varndean College is in Brighton and has an impressive pass rate of 100 per cent in arts subjects offered 

One sociology student at Varndean College (pictured), who is also a Millwall fan, said the perception of the team and its supporters was 'outdated' and there are 'unjustifiable stereotypes' about the club

One Varndean sociology student and Millwall fan said the perception of Millwall was 'outdated', adding: 'As a Millwall fan I think there are some underlying, unjustifiable stereotypes about Millwall. 

'From the college's point of view, and as a sociology student, I understand them using the trip to try to explain some sociological terms but I do feel that ‘women challenging gender norms’ is unfair as women have been attending football games since day dot.' 

Varndean College is a state-funded sixth form college in Brighton, one of the wealthiest areas of the UK, and has a 98 per cent pass rate for all A-levels, and a 100 per cent pass rate for arts subjects. It runs a number of arts societies such as life drawing and art enrichment, where students are able to go on visits to galleries, studios and meetings with contemporary designers.

Millwall has a history of violent disorder, dating back 100 years when fights erupted when the team played long standing rivals West Ham.

Its former ground The Old Den became so notorious with fans who would roar for their team from start to finish that clubs did not like playing there because it was so intimidating. It was closed five times by the Football Association. 

In 1978 a fight broke out in the Den after Millwall played an FA Cup quarter final against Ipswich Town, and dozens of fans were injured.  

In 2001 Millwall fans clashed with riot police after a draw with Nottingham Forest at the New Den, London 

The club became associated with the Millwall Bushwhackers, one of the most well known and violent hooligan groups in the 1970s and 1980s. 

In 1982 Millwall club chairman Alan Thorne threatened to close the club because of violence sparked by losing in the FA Cup to non-league side Slough Town. 

The Kenilworth riot in 1985 took place after a sixth round FA Cup match between Millwall and Luton Town. Thousands of fans poured into the small stadium in Luton and violence broke out with fights and missiles being thrown, one hitting Luton goalkeeper Les Sealey. The incident led to Luton Town banning away fans for four years and was one of the most widely reported examples of football hooliganism.

After a play off against Birmingham a trail of destruction was left through the city and 47 police injured

A large number of Millwall fans were issued with ten year bans in 2002 after a major riot ensured following a play-off game against Birmingham. Almost 50 police officers were injured during the violence and a trail of devastation was left in the streets, with several cars burnt out. 

In 2009 a fan at a match between Millwall and West Ham was stabbed as others started to throw bricks and start fires. West Ham supporters invaded the pitch at Upton Park at least three times and the club was later charged with two counts of violent, threatening behaviour and police said it must have been organised beforehand. Millwall was cleared of three charges.

In April 2013 several Millwall fans were arrested after an outburst of violence when the team lost the FA Cup semi-final to Wigan at Wembley. Tensions ran so high that fans were reportedly attacking both police and each other.

More than 100 fans have of the club, known as the Lions, have been issued with lifelong bans for getting involved in hooliganism and violence.  

In 2009 officials large crowds gathered at a match between Millwall and West Ham, where a fan was stabbed

Other societies include performing arts, politics and an extended English literature programme. Staff support students who wish to apply for Oxbridge, and students have gone to study at a number of top universities including Cambridge and Imperial College in London.

It is the only college designated by the Government to offer the International Baccalaureate in Brighton and Hove and has been running this for seven years.

The college takes about 1,500 students a year, with around 70 international students from 15 countries, who are able to come to it to study for three, six, nine or 18 months. It achieved an overall 'good' rating in the last Ofsted report in 2012.

This year 76 per cent of students achieved A* to C grades in their A Levels.
