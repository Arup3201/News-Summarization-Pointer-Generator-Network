A Pennsylvania high school senior student was suspended Thursday when he asked Miss America, Nina Davuluri, out to the prom when she made an appearance at the school.

Davuluri was at Central York High School in York, just south of the state capital, Harrisburg, Thursday when Patrick Farves, 18, asked Miss America to prom during a question and answer session.

Farves said he received three days of in-school suspension he asking the reigning Miss America out to the prom.

Although he was warned not to by a staff member, Patrick Farves, 18, asked Miss America out to the prom during an appearance she made at the school, earning Farves a three-day suspension.

'They (administrators) did that because they told me not to but I did it anyway," Farves responded on Twitter to a question from areporter. 'They did what they had to.'

Davuluri was at the school Thursday to talk with students about diversity and the importance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. She also gave keynote speech at the school's annual diversity celebration.

It wasn't a spur of the moment decision for Farves. He had joked with friends about doing it when he heard Miss America was coming to the school, according to the York Dispatch. And as the day got closer, he was asked increasingly if he was going to go through with it.

School administrators caught wind of Farves' plan, and one staff member pulled him aside before the assembly and told him it would be inappropriate to ask Davuluri out.

But that didn't stop Farves.

'At that point in time, it was 10 minutes before the presentation, and I was pretty much set to do it,' he said. 'I was a little pressured. Everybody expected me to do it. I'm the kind of person who, if someone says I won't do something, I'll prove people wrong. I will.'

The school, facing criticism from some who thought the administration went to far, responded on Friday afternoon.

'It is not our practice to discipline a student for asking someone — even Miss America — to a school dance,' the statement from the Central York School District reads in part.

'However, it is our practice to set expectations for student behavior, to communicate those expectations and rules to students and families and to ensure those rules are followed within our schools. This practice is not uncommon and happens every day, multiple times a day, in schools, businesses and homes across America.'

The school district also took offense to the media's reporting of the incident, saying, 'it's as shame that the media wants to frame this story to sell papers and make headlines using a distortion of what actually occurred.'

Many students, however, think the administration overreacted, and took to social media to express their feeling, using the hashtag #freepatty on Twitter.

'True diversity is when you don't punish someone for being a little bit different" @CYStudentUnion tweeted.
