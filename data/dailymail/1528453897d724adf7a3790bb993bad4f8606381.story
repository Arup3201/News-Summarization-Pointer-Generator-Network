General Motors Co ordered
half a million replacement ignition switches almost two months
before it alerted federal safety regulators of the issues that
prompted a recall of millions of vehicles, according to new reports.  

The email exchanges between the auto-maker and its supplier Delphi Automotive Plc were reported by the Wall Street Journal. 

The emails, which took place in mid-December 2013
between a GM contract worker and Delphi, indicated that GM placed an
'urgent' order for 500,000 replacement switches on December 18, a
day after a meeting of senior executives, the newspaper said.

announced its recall in February 2014.

Representatives for GM and Delphi Automotive did not
immediately respond to emails seeking comment on the matter.

'This is simply mind-blowing in its raw evilness,' said Bob
Hilliard, lead counsel for the personal injury and wrongful
death plaintiffs in the Federal Multi District Litigation
against General Motors.

'GM should have notified its customers immediately to take
all weight off of their key chains. 

'By the time GM actually
ordered these parts, it had to have already spent months making
the decision to place the order,' Hilliard said in a statement.

GM has faced criticism for waiting 11 years to begin
recalling millions of cars with ignition-switch problems that
have been linked to fatalities. 

The switch in question can slip
out of position, stalling the vehicle and disabling air bags.
The defect led to the recall of 2.6 million vehicles earlier
this year.

So far, 61 claims have been deemed eligible for
compensation, including 30 deaths and 31 injuries.

A federal judge in Manhattan has set January 11, 2016, for the
first trial in consolidated litigation against General Motors
over a series of safety issues, including a faulty ignition
switch.

Those eligible to sue include GM customers whose accidents came after the U.S. auto giant emerged from bankruptcy in 2009.

Some of the claims come from family members who lost relatives in accidents allegedly caused by the defect.

Last month, two families from Wisconsin accepted a settlement offer from General Motors after their teenage daughters were killed in a crash caused by a faulty ignition switch.

Amy Rademaker, 15, and Natasha Weigel, 17, were killed when the Chevy Cobalt that they were traveling in crashed. 

A fault with the car's ignition switch turned off vital systems such as the power steering and airbags moments before the crash.

The girls' family accepted the offer after they dropped a lawsuit against the Detroit car giant which could have hidden behind bankruptcy protection in the event of a court case.

Margie Beskau, mother of Miss Rademaker, told CNBC at the time: 'No amount of money can bring my daughter back. But I'm ready to be done with this.'
