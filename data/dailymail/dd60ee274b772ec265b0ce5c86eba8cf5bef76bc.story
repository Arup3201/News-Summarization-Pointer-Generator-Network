Extremist: Haitham al-Haddad's speech has been posponed

Jihadi John's former university was a 'hotbed of radicalism' where students 'celebrated 9/11', it has been claimed.

A former student has lifted the lid on his time at the University of Westminster - as a talk by a  Muslim extremist has been postponed due to 'security concerns'.

Haitham al-Haddad was set to speak tonight, but the event will not go ahead as planned after it was revealed 'Jihadi John' studied computer programming at the university. 

Today, the terrorist was named as a university graduate from London who was able to flee to Syria despite being on an MI5 terror watch list.

Mohammed Emwazi, 27, of Queen’s Park, west London is said to have travelled to the Middle East three years ago and later joined ISIS.

Jihadi John has featured in the execution videos of British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines, U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, Japanese reporter Kenji Goto and Syrian soldiers. 

Former University of Westminster pupil Raheem Kassam, who campaigns against extremism at British universities, said the conditions at the university are right for the radicalisation of someone like Emwazi. 

Speaking today, he said: ‘I once walked into a meeting of the Islamic Society where they were clapping and cheering the events of 9/11.  

‘I did not know him, he would have been two years behind me, but I am utterly unsurprised.'

‘The university was nothing less than a hotbed of radicalism when I was there. 

‘Universities across the country, the University of Westminster in particular, are being targeted by radical recruiters.'  

A spokesman from the University of Westminster said: 'We take these allegations very seriously. We condemn any behaviour that promotes terrorism and violence on any of our campuses.

'We have strict policies to promote tolerance among our 20,000 student community, who come to study from over 150 nations.

'Any student found to be engaging in radicalised activity would be referred to disciplinary procedures. 

'As a London-based university operating in a diverse multi-cultural city, we are fully aware of all the influences within this international city. With other universities in London, we are working together to implement the Government’s Prevent strategy to tackle extremism.

'We strongly encourage anyone who is concerned about radicalisation to speak out and contact the Student Support and Well-being team. The safety and security of our students is our foremost concern.'

Dr Al-Haddad's planned visit to the university sparked anger and a petition launched by the university’s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) society opposing his visit was signed by more than 3,000 people.

It has been reported he said gays should be outlawed,  terror boss Osama bin Laden will go to heaven and has also spoken out in favour of female genital mutilation, but he has claimed in the past his comments have been misinterpreted.

It's also been claimed he said Jewish people are descended from 'apes and pigs', and says people who leave Islam should be executed, although again he stresses his words have been misinterpreted.

I did not know him, he would have been two years behind me, but I am utterly, utterly unsurprised.

The university was nothing less than a hotbed of radicalism when I was there.

Are the conditions at Westminster right for the radicalisation of someone like him? The answer is yes, 100 per cent.

I once walked into a meeting of the Islamic Society where they were clapping and cheering the events of 9/11. 

It was at that moment in my life I realised I wanted to set up an organisation in my life to tackle it.

Having been brought up in a Muslim household and then seeing that happening is pretty galling stuff.’ 

Universities across the country, the University of Westminster in particular, are being targeted by radical recruiters.

These guys [students] are being professionally radicalised. They tried it with me and they try it with any Muslim.

I remember very vividly how I would get cornered by three or four Somali guys - students in the class with me who were dressed in non-western clothing – and they would say I must come along to the Islamic Society meetings otherwise I’m not a proper Muslim.

When you are 18-years-old and a practising Muslim you feel inclined to go.

I went along and saw what was happening and it absolutely disgusted me.

This afternoon, a spokesman for the university said: ‘Tonight’s event has been postponed due to increased sensitivity and security concerns.’

The University of Westminster has been criticised for segregating male and female students during talks by Islamic scholars.

It was one of 21 university institutions which were found to promote gender segregation.

Research by Student Rights, a group which aims to prevent extremism at universities, said that from September to March 2013, 46 events at 21 separate institutions were found to have been segregated.

At the University of Westminster, at least two events were found to have been advertised as ‘women only’.

The research found that on March 21, 2013 a debate entitled ‘Secularism vs. Islam’ was held by the Women’s Take on Current Affairs Society (WTCA), a Hizb ut-Tahrir front group, and featured Shohana Khan as a speaker.

When challenged by students as to why the WTCA was able to hold events segregated by gender, the Student Union Interfaith Officer allegedly claimed that the society’s events were ‘faith-based’, which exempted it from equal opportunities policy.

In addition to this, an event the following day was held by the Islamic Society called ‘The Concept of Love in Islam’ which was also advertised as ‘Sisters only’. It was logged by Student Rights for this reason.

Student Rights said that when a male student from the society complained about not being able to attend, the Islamic Society highlighted that segregated events were common on campus stating ‘we’ve had many brothers only events too...the information discussed in the only women talks/or notes can be put to the public after the talk...the topics at hand do not only concern women.’

The University of Westminster’s ‘Dignity and Diversity at Work and Study Policy’ states that: ‘The University of Westminster is committed to creating a stimulating, supportive, inclusive and accessible learning and working environment... The University has a legal responsibility to provide a healthy and safe working environment that is free from unlawful discrimination and harassment.’ 

A spokesperson from the University of Westminster said: 'The university does not allow gender segregation and it will not tolerate this type of prejudice. The university strictly complies with the Equality Act 2010 the Human Rights Act 1998.

'The events concerned were not gender segregated events. Many organisations and universities host events which are of interest to women and open to all women, such as feminist groups and women in business networking events.

'56% of our international student community are women.

'The Islamic Society is one of many societies that are part of the University of Westminster Students’ Union which is an independent body.

'The Islamic Society is one of many societies that are part of the University of Westminster Students’ Union which is an independent body. 

'The University does not control its activities but does monitor that it is legally compliant.'
