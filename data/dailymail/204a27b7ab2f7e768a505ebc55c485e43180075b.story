For Hearts fans, Christmas Eve will see them wake up in receipt of a gift that not long ago was beyond even their wildest dreams.

Back in the dark days of relegation from the Premiership in May, after administration and its accompanying 15 point deduction, little could those followers who merrily sang festive songs on repeat on Tuesday night at Central Park have dreamed of how 2014 would eventually pan out.

This deserved win over Cowdenbeath, achieved thanks to goals in either half from front two James Keatings and Callum Paterson, ensured Robbie Neilson's relentless team streaked 12 points clear of nearest challengers Rangers.

In wrapping up a remarkable 47 points out of the 51 available so far in the Championship, his side has outscored every team in the league, conceded less than any other and outclassed all.

With Rangers enmeshed in unprecedented turmoil this week – even by their miserable standards at troubled Ibrox – it's tempting just to wrap up the title now and deliver it to Tynecastle first thing on Wednesday morning.

Robbie Neilson won't think like that, of course. Ever the professional, the unexcitable Hearts boss will instead preach the same mantra. That his side should merely focus on the next match, away to Livingston on Saturday, and aim to round off the year in style. 

But in truth would take a capitulation to far outstrip Devon Loch in the 1956 Grand National for the Edinburgh club not to reclaim their place in the top flight after 12 months.

Indeed, Hearts could even be 15 ahead by Saturday evening, should Rangers, in the wake of manager Ally McCoist leaving and his No 2 Ian Durrant's demotion, succumb to Hibs at Easter Road in Kenny McDowall's first match as a manager.

They used to say McCoist the striker, long before his tough spell in management, could fall into the River Clyde and emerge holding a fish supper. The same, so far, is true for Neilson in the dugout. He has barely put a foot wrong so far in his first post in management.

Given the unpredictable December weather, his bold decision to rearrange this match just 10 days after a frozen pitch rendered the game unplayable had been widely questioned. But Neilson wanted it played, wanted it won, and last night he got his wish amid crisp and clear conditions on a decent playing surface.

Last night's win was not luck, though, as Neilson would surely point out. The Hearts boss, who prides himself on his attention to detail, arranged a pre-season game here in the summer to familiarise himself with the dimensions of the Central Park pitch.

That prompted him to ditch his favoured 4-4-2 with wide midfielders in favour of a 4-3-1-2. It was left to his fullbacks Jordan McGhee and Adam Eckersley to prove the attacking width.

And it was a ploy that worked a treat with Eckersley's cutback setting up Keatings for the crucial opening goal from six yards. It was the former Celtic trainee's third in his last three games, and his seventh of the season.

It was full reward for Hearts' dominance from the first whistle, after both sets of fans had held an impeccably-observed minute's silence in honour of all those affected by the horrific bin lorry tragedy in Glasgow on Monday.

Keatings, the former Hamilton striker who elected not to go up with Accies to aid the Tynecastle side's promotion drive, nearly grabbed a quickfire second. But his fierce freekick from 20 yards beat keeper Robbie Thompson only to smack back off the bottom left post and away to safety. As Hearts searched for a second, Keatings then set up Paterson, whose shot fizzed narrowly wide of the post.

Cowdenbeath were holding onto the ball well but Hearts worked ever so hard to close them down the home side was largely restricted to shooting from distance in vain.

On the one occasion they did slice through Hearts, keeper Neil Alexander was the hero of the hour with a fine save from 16 yards. Higgins, however, should have burst the net with his low drive.

Neilson then made the decision to replace Keatings with Sam Nicholson after 60 minutes; a decision that was surely down to injury. If it wasn't, no matter. The Hearts boss' Midas touch remained, as within 120 seconds his team was 2-0 up. Miguel Pallardo's cross was cleared and Paterson first headed the ball, then chested it and finally blasted home a festive cracker from 20 yards.

It was a quality goal that underlined the 20-year-old's versatility. Paterson shone up front last night but in November he was called up by Scotland for cover at his regular position, right back, after Phil Bardsley had pulled out of matches against the Republic of Ireland and England.

After that a shot fired into the side netting by sub Craig Sutherland and a header from the same player saved by Alexander was about as good as it got for Jimmy Nicholl's men. They never looked like rescuing anything from this game and many home fans headed for the exits a good 20 minutes before time.

The Hearts fans, by contrast, remained to the end and were jubilant at the final whistle. They sported the delirious demeanour of a set of fans who have now not witnessed a league defeat on the road since at Kilmarnock on March 8.

'We shall not be moved,' they sang.

And who, frankly, could disagree?
