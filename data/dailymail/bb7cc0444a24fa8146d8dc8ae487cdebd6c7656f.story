Five men were arrested yesterday following an alleged sexual assault on a child at a private nursery.

Police, who have not revealed the child’s age or sex, said the victim told parents that the attack took place last week.

The arrested men were all ‘either  working at or having access to’ three Montessori day care centres, police said.

Investigation: Detectives today raided three nurseries and arrested five male nursery workers after a toddler claimed to have been sexually assaulted. This is the Bright Eyes nursery in Droitwich

None of the suspects are parents of any of the children there.

They were arrested at different sites of the Bright Eyes Montessori nurseries in Worcestershire.

The nurseries at Redditch, Bromsgrove and Droitwich have closed voluntarily while police investigate.

West Mercia Police stressed that the arrests relate to a single alleged incident by one person on a single child.

The child attends one of the nurseries but staff move between the three sites, as do some of the children.

It is thought that police expect to 
eliminate some of the men quickly, and there is nothing to suggest a 
paedophile ring was in operation.

At a press conference yesterday, 
Superintendent Kevin Purcell said: ‘We do not suspect a ring of 
offenders, but we felt it was appropriate to arrest five men.

Allegations: Officers from West Mercia Police swooped on three branches of the privately-run Bright Eyes Nurseries in Bromsgrove, Redditch and Droitwich

‘We are seeking only one perpetrator but based on the available information we have now made five arrests.

‘We are looking for someone with 
access to the nurseries, either as an employee or some other 
association. Some are staff, others are associates, none are strangers 
to the nurseries.’

He added: ‘The incident is alleged to have been relatively recent, we were informed last Thursday.

‘It can be difficult to interview a young victim so officers with  special training have been working with the child.’

Held: Five men have been arrested over an allegation of a child being sexually assaulted at a day nursery. Officers have been searching this premises in Bromsgrove as well as two others

The force said the complainant was a 
‘very young child’. The Bromsgrove nursery cares  for 67 children aged 
up to five, and the Redditch site for 36.

It is unclear how many children attend the Droitwich nursery.

Montessori schools and nurseries have a less academic approach, favouring learning through play.

Police have been searching all three nurseries, along with three other properties.

Superintendent Purcell said they were taking the child’s disclosure ‘extremely seriously’.

He added: ‘Our primary concern is their welfare as well as that of the other children who attend the nurseries.

‘We fully understand how concerning 
this disclosure will be to those people whose children attend Bright 
Eyes Nurseries, as well as the wider community.’

Parents attending the nurseries were given letters by police officers explaining their activities. This is a file picture of a West Mercia police officer

The men were in custody yesterday at Worcester and Kidderminster police stations.

Nobody from the nurseries, which cost parents around £157 a week, was available to comment.

Ofsted inspectors rated early years provision at the three sites ‘good’ in their most recent visits.

Outside the Bromsgrove site 
yesterday, one parent with a child at the nursery said: ‘It’s very 
worrying. You expect to send your child to school and be completely 
safe.

‘It makes you feel sick to your stomach. I can’t believe what has happened.’

Police said a meeting will be held with parents today to allay fears.

The Montessori approach to  education
was founded by Maria Montessori, an Italian medical graduate who 
believed in learning through movement.

It is thought the three nurseries are not connected to any other Montessori nurseries.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
