Marcos Rojo surrendered his Manchester United allegiances for the evening as he watched local boyhood club Estudiantes in action against Gimnasia in the fierce Platense derby on Sunday.

Sporting a Barcelona  vest, the Argentine certainly didn't lack any passion whilst cheering on the side known as 'The Rat Stabbers', a club he joined at the age of ten.

Much to the clear delight of the Argentina international, Estudiantes went on to win the Primera Division clash 3-1 after Ezequiel Cerutti scored from the spot in the 89th minute.

The United centre back has begun to find form for Louis van Gaal's side since his £16million move from Sporting Lisbon in the summer. 

Rojo has formed a tight bond with fellow defensive partner Phil Jones, who last week expressed his joy at how quickly the 24-year-old had settled in.

Jones told manutd.com: 'Since Marcos has come he's played the right way and in the way we've wanted to play. It's difficult to come over to a different country and a different league and go straight into the team and hit your form, but he's done well.'

The Red Devils will be looking to expand on Saturday's win against Sunderland with a victory at Newcastle on Wednesday.
