Tonight Nik Wallenda defied death walking across a tightrope more than 500ft above the Chicago river - then doing it again with a blindfold on.

Setting two new world records in the process, the 35-year-old daredevil braved the winds and 

But - though he had fans aplenty - many used his nail-biting challenge as a change to make jibes and mock those involved. According to the Discovery Channel, which aired the stunt live, more than 220,000 tweets were sent weighing in on the event. 

Scary: Wallenda shuffled out between the west and east Marina City towers wearing and blindfold, guided by a pinging noise

Some over-eager pranksters even killed Wallenda off by editing a death date of November 2, 2014 into his Wikipedia page.

The change - edited out before any detail could be inserted - implied that he had perished in the attempt - which Wallenda freely admitted was a possibility even as he took his first steps over the brink of the west Marina City tower, by the Chicago River.

Many used their social media accounts simply to marvel at his skill - with some pointing out they can barely walk through their homes in the dark.

Another was impressed that Wallenda managed to give a running commentary of his attempt, talking to his father over an intercom. 

Keen: Many tweeters pointed out how much more capable Nik Wallenda is than them

Premature death: One Wikipedia user changed Wallenda's biography page to say that he died on November 2 2014 - implying that he had perished in the tightrope walk attempt

But others took a chance to snipe over issues close to their hearts.

Several gestured towards the high levels of gun crime on the streets of Chicago - with one joking it would be a 'moral victory' if Wallenda made it across without being shot, with another quipping he was safer on the high-wire than on the streets.

Others mocked their fellow tweeters after a spelling mistake made it on to Twitter's list of trending topics.

Stay safe: Others roped in Chicago's reputation for gun crime when discussing the stunt

Stay smart: Many remarked on the fact that a mis-spelled version of the hashtag for the event gained traction

At one point, more accounts were posting under the hashtag #SkyScrapperLive than the correctly-spelled #SkyScraperLive, prompting ridicule from those with access to spellcheck.

Some also took umbrage at the Discovery Channel's coverage of the event - which came with more than an hour of build-up before Wallenda took to the wire.

One irate user described the coverage as 'a 2-hour weather update and a ten minute walk' with another wondering aloud whether enough emphasis had been put on the fact that the stunt is dangerous.

Special attention was also reserved for TV evangelist Joel Osteen, who prayed on live TV with Wallenda before the attempt.

A Tweeter joked that an even more daring venture would be to 'do his highwire act from one side of Joel Osteen's ego to the other'.

Overegged? One tweeter took issue with the Discovery Channel's emphasis on how dangerous the stunt was

Excessive? Another commentator thought the channel had spent too long talking about the weather

Next challenge? One quipped that a greater task would be to traverse the ego of televangelist Joel Osteen
