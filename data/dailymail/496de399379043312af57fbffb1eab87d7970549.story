Almost every single 2013 Holden Commodore and Caprice is being recalled after a potential fault with the front seatbelts was found.

The car manufacturer is recalling a total of 42,000 vehicles from the VF Commodore and WN Caprice range - models that went on sale in May last year.

A public recall was issued by Holden on Monday afternoon - a week after a confidential message was sent to the company's network of 230 dealers.

The 2013 Commodore, released just last year in May, is being recalled because of a fault in the front seatbelts

The message ordered them to stop selling any more new Commodores and Caprices, and told them not to transfer the cars to other showrooms.

It has been discovered the seatbelt pre-tensioner - which automatically tightens the seatbelt in the event of a crash - can make contact with the seatbelt buckle unit under the seat.

This could potentially cause an electrical short and disable the pre-tensioner in the crash.

Pre-tensioners are meant to catch the seatbelt's slack just milliseconds before airbags are deployed.

The manufacturer said no one had reported the fault.

It has been advised that owners of the 2013 Commodore and Caprice model should contact their nearest Holden dealer.

Dealers will then inspect the car and correct the fault.
