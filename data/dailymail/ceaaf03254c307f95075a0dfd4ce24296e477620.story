For many, Lego is an obsession. But scattered bricks can be untidy - not to mention incredibly painful when you unwittingly step on one.

But now an app built for Google’s Chrome browser could make it a thing of the past, as users can build whimsical creations online.

The two companies have joined up so that people of all ages can build bright blocky structures on their phones, tablets and computers and show them off to the world.

Lego fans could build their house in situ, re-create a famous landmark such as the Eiffel Tower (pictured), or build something the world has never seen and plonk it in the middle of Antarctica, using the new app

Originally built by a team in Australia to showcase WebGL – a 3D graphics technology –  and to celebrate Lego’s 50th birthday in June 2012, the experiment has now been rolled out  as a fully-functioning web tool..

The app, called Build with Chrome, lets people build creations by dragging different shapes and sizes of the colourful bricks onto a virtual board, all without having to struggle to find the ideal brick in a jumbled up box.

While real Lego models have to be dismantled to make way for new construction projects, Google and Lego’s app allows people to publish their creations on a plot of land anywhere in the world, as they are overlaid on Google Maps.

Originally built by a team in Australia to showcase WebGL - a 3D graphics technology -  and to celebrate Lego's 50th birthday, the experiment has now been rolled out across the world. Creations can be placed on Google Maps (illustrated in a promotional video)

So you could build your house in situ, re-create a famous landmark, or build something the world has never seen and plonk it in the middle of Antarctica.

With a certain level of cooperation and precision, whole cityscapes could potentially be created and it is easy for users to see other creations situated close to their own.

Fans of the plastic toy might miss using 
their hands to create buildings, so the app makes use of the 
touchscreens on phones and tablets so that users can pinch and drag 
bricks into position, according to a Google blog post.

Users of the app can sign in with their Google+ account, which enables them to find buildings their friends have created.

Completed builds are categorised in different systems so that people can sort, filter and search for different types of structures – including 2D and 3D.

To ‘hone your engineering skills’ Lego fans can learn new skills from a number of short tutorials so that they can build structures that will be featured in the upcoming Warner Brothers  film, ‘The Lego Movie,’ which due to be released on 7 February.

Lego men are set to outnumber people in 2019

It is predicted that there could be a miniature Lego figure for every person on Earth in 2019.

According to a mathematical online comic, Lego has been making its little people at such a rate that they will outnumber the human population by the end of the decade.

At the end of 2006, the company announced there were four billion miniature figures in existence, being played with by children across the planet.

A physics graduate from Massachusetts, who is behind the web comic Xkcd.com has calculated that the predictions for the global population and predictions for the number of Lego Figurines will match up in 2019 and the plastic people will go on to out-number humans.

If the predictions are correct, there will be almost eight billion people and the same amount of Lego figures calling Earth home in 2019.

Lego said in 2008 that it has made 400 billion Lego bricks since the company began, which is enough for 62 each for every person in existence at that time.

The first Lego figurine went on sale in 1978 and since then, billions have been produced, making them the world's biggest population group, according to the company.
