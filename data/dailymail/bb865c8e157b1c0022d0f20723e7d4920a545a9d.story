This seasonal selection of mugshots features a rogue's gallery of bad Santa lookalikes who have had brushes with U.S. law enforcement officers over the last few years.

And while it is not known what these bushy-bearded bad boys have been collared for, we're sure Mrs Christmas will have something to say when Santa is released back to Lapland.
