The bill for winter fuel payments to British pensioners  living abroad has soared by 70 per cent in a year, thanks to a European court ruling.

As millions of elderly people in the UK face a cold winter and inflation-busting rises to their energy bills, it was revealed that a record £21million was paid last year to expats living in sunnier climes such as Spain, Cyprus and France.

It came as new figures from energy watchdog Ofgem showed that record numbers of Scots were in arrears on their fuel bills.

The number of winter fuel payments made overseas has rocketed in the last decade, with sharp rises in Spain, France and Ireland in the last year

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith yesterday said the decision by the European Court of Justice was ‘ridiculous’ as his department revealed its staggering cost.

The bill soared from £12.8million in 2011/12 after judges ruled that anyone with a ‘sufficient link’ to Britain could claim the £200-£300 allowance.

‘The huge increase in UK  winter fuel payments equates to a near doubling in costs to the British taxpayer and that is wholly unacceptable,’ he said.

‘It is not fair and it’s not something this government is going to tolerate.

‘This increase is a direct result of a ridiculous ruling by the European Court of Justice and we are not prepared to sit back and allow hard-working taxpayers money to be used in this way.’

Previously, expats had to be resident in Britain until they were 60 before they could claim the benefit, but the ruling allows people who lived or worked in Britain for most of their lives to qualify.

Anger: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said it was 'ridiculous' that British money was being sent overseas

Last year, 49,443 pensioners living in Spain alone – where temperatures in December and January can reach 63F (17C) – received £8.8million.

Last year, the allowance was claimed by nearly 120,000  people living in the European Economic Area.

It is estimated that the European judges’ ruling allowed up to 440,000 expats to claim the payment.

However, from 2015 pensioners living in countries with an average winter temperature higher than the warmest part of the UK will be unable to claim, excluding around 100,000 expats.

There has been deepening controversy over the growing bill in so-called ‘sunshine  benefits’ to expats, which are costing the taxpayer around £2million a week.

Around 12million pensioners in Britain receive the winter fuel payment, but critics – including Mr Duncan Smith and Nick Clegg – have called for it to be limited to poorer people who need help to meet their fuel bills.

However, David Cameron has promised to protect the payments – which are worth £200 to a household with someone aged over 60, and £300 for those aged over 80 – until 2015.

The news came as figures from Ofgem showed that Scots are more likely to be in arrears on their power bills than families in other parts of the UK.

Some 6.1 per cent of gas users and 5.9 per cent of electricity users are in debt to energy firms, compared with a UK average of 5 per cent.

At the end of 2012, a total of 153,201 Scottish households owed money on their electricity bills and 119,125 on their gas accounts.

With the average bill set to hit a record £1,500, many will face a growing battle to keep the heating on.

The number of households repaying arrears on gas bills has soared by 11 per cent in two years.

A spokesman for trade body Energy UK, said: ‘Energy  suppliers take seriously their responsibilities for helping  vulnerable customers, and  customers in debt, targeting appropriate support to meet individual circumstances.

It follows recent announcements by the Big Six energy firms of rises to bills of up to 10 per cent.

EDF Energy was the latest to announce its increases yesterday, saying that both gas and electricity prices would rise by 3.9 per cent in January.
