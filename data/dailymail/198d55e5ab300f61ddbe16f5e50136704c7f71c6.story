Interstellar director Christopher Nolan has revealed that he does not use basic day-to-day technology - because he 'can't be bothered'

His £105m space epic took audiences on a breathtaking ride into outer space and even helped spawn scientific discoveries.

But Christopher Nolan, the visionary filmmaker behind the sci-fi spectacular Interstellar, has revealed he does not use basic day-to-day technology - because he 'couldn't be bothered'.

The British director, who also directed Inception and the Dark Knight trilogy, opts not to have email because he does not believe it 'would help me with anything I'm doing'.

Nor does he own a mobile phone - which he says gives him time 'to think'. 

He told the Hollywood Reporter: 'Well, I’ve never used email because I don’t find it would help me with anything I’m doing. I just couldn’t be bothered about it.

'As far as the cellphone goes... I’m never two feet from a cellphone.

'It’s very easy to get in touch with me when people need to. I actually really like not having one because it gives me time to think.

'You know, when you have a smartphone and you have 10 minutes to spare, you go on it and you start looking at stuff.'

The 44-year-old also told how few people had mobile phones when he moved to Los Angeles to start making films in 1997.

He said: 'I've been very fortunate to be working continuously, so there's always someone around me who can tap me on the shoulder and hand me a phone if they need to.'

The director of the Batman films - which are packed with gadgets - has previously referred to mobile phones as 'just toys for grown-ups'.

Warner Bros did previously assign Nolan with an email address but he only realised several years later - by which time there were thousands of messages in the inbox.

He has since made the studio close the account.

Interstellar has so far taken £426m around the world.

The master storyteller wrote the screenplay for the film with his younger brother Jonathan a decade after they first won acclaim for their dark reboot of the Batman franchise.

It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine.
