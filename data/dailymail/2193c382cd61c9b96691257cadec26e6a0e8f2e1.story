A 35-year-old man was lucky to escape with his life after his dog accidentally shot him in the leg as they travelled in his truck.

The 9mm pistol, which was on the floor of the cab at the time, was set off when it was kicked by the hapless hound near Sebring in Florida.

Gregory Dale Lanier was wounded in the leg, but escaped serious injury, police said.

Bizarre: A man was shot in the leg after his pet dog kicked a gun that was lying on the floor of his truck (file picture)

Firearm: The weapon involved was a 9mm pistol, although the exact make and model has not been reported (stock picture of a Glock 9mm pistol)

Sebring Police Commander Steve Carr, said he had never heard 
of a similar case of a dog shooting a man.

According to the police report, Mr Lanier said he was 
driving along State Road 17 North when the dog kicked 'the unloaded .380
 pistol,' the Highlands Tribune reports.

The report said the gun was actually a 9mm 
weapon, not a .380. The incident is the latest in a 
string of bizarre shootings in Florida.

Incident: Mr Lanier was driving with his dog in his truck near the town of Sebring in Florida

Shooting. The gun went off while the pair were driving along State Route 17 near the town. Mr Lanier was lucky to escape with minor injuries

Last week, a woman in St 
Petersburg was wounded when she was shot by a friend's oven, according to NBCNews.

Under Florida law, handguns carried in a vehicle must be either 'securely encased' or not immediately available for use.

This means the weapon should be kept in a glove compartment, snapped into a holster; in a gun case, or in a closed box or container.
