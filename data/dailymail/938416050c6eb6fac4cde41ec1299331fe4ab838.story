Manchester United target William Carvalho has been named in Portugal's provisional 30-man squad ahead of the World Cup in Brazil.

The Sporting Lisbon midfielder, who could well be on his way to Old Trafford this summer should United maintain their interest, made his international debut during Portugal's World Cup play-off triumph against Sweden back in November.

It comes as no surprise that the 22-year-old is joined in the squad by Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo.
