Nearly ten years after a 15-year-old girl was kidnapped and murdered while walking to school police have released new details of her killers.

Los Angeles detectives released composite sketches on Friday of two possible suspects in Brenda Sierra's abduction on the morning of October 18 2002 while walking to Schurr High School.

Her body was found a day later near the Valley of Enchantment at Crestline but an arrest was never made despite a $150,000 reward offered for information leading to her killer.

Murdered: New clues and suspects have been released in the brutal kidnap and murder of 15-year-old Brenda Sierra outside her California home in 2002

Suspects: Detectives with the LA County Sheriff's Department held a press conference Friday releasing these two composite sketches of possible unidentified gang members and suspects in her death

Investigators grappled for clues at the time of her death while limited by police's belief her abductors were members of a gang.

Both
Miss Sierra and her family were believed to be without gang involvement 
or relation by police, while participation in the case from other gang members initially remained cold.

Questioning: George Barraza, sought as a person of interest since 2009, is believed to have fled the area possibly intermittently to Mexico

'But with the passage of time, some of the gang members have been killed, locked up or disassociated themselves from the gang and there have been more tips,' Homicide Lt. Dave Coleman of the L.A. County Sheriff's Department told the Los Angeles Times.

'Also, we now have new ways of looking at fingerprints and DNA,' he said.

With the sketches of the unidentified 
men, police also released a photo of another named George Barraza, who's
been sought as a person of interest in the case since 2009.

Barraza, approximately 32 years old 
and known by the name of 'Trooper,' is believed to have fled the area to
Mexico but could be moving intermittently between borders.

Over time detectives have also learned
that one or two women may have made contact with Miss Sierra during her
abduction, possibly aiding her attackers.

They believe this may have been 
witnessed by neighbours or that the women may be ready to come forward 
with their information, prompting a press conference Friday.

'Certainly, we hope that anyone with 
knowledge of this horrific incident will overcome any fear of coercion 
or retaliation and come forward and bring justice to Brenda and her 
family,' Mr Colman stated at the conference.

Dumped: Miss Sierra was kidnapped off a sidewalk while walking to Schurr High School with her body found the next day, dumped near the Valley of Enchantment at Crestline

Unsolved: Since her death, no arrests have been made while police hope more witnesses, including one or two women who possibly aided her attackers, will be willing to come forward
