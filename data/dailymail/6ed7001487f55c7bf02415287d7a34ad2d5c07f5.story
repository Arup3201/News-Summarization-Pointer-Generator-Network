Aston Villa finally wilted to the star power of Manchester City as Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero's late strikes kept the Premier League holders in touch with leaders Chelsea.

After coming close throughout the match, it appeared Villa would pull off a miraculous draw but Toure's delicate left-footed finish in the 82nd minutes set them on their way for the away win. 

Aguero put the result beyond doubt six minutes later with an emphatic blast passed Villa keeper Brad Guzan.

Sportsmail's Jack Gaughan was at Villa Park and assesses all the players' performances.

ASTON VILLA

Brad Guzan - A couple of absolutely brilliant saves followed by some more. There looked to have been no beating the American. Composed goalkeeper who is always talking to his back four. 8

Alan Hutton - Absolutely abysmal in possession. Failed to find a claret shirt all night. Perhaps a one-off, because Hutton has started the season relatively well. 5

Philippe Senderos - Big brute of a centre-half and gave Edin Dzeko a real game. Strong in the air and wasn’t turned on too many occasions. 6.5

Nathan Baker - Superb early block on Toure - always puts his body on the line for the cause. Did so again when Dzeko bore down on goal with a stunning last ditch tackle. 7

Aly Cissokho - Got forward to decent effect and got tight to James Milner on City’s right. One of his better games for Villa. 6.5

Charles N’Zogbia - Has his old swagger back, encapsulated with a 50-yard drive through midfield before firing wide just outside the box. 6.5

Fabian Delph - Busy, as ever. Puts himself about - exactly what Villa need - and is a real driving force. Change of pace in midfield urged the hosts on. 7

Ashley Westwood - Game rather passed Westwood by. Sitting in front of the back four, he could only watch as Aguero, Silva and the rest found too much space in the area he patrolled. 5

Tom Cleverley - Was quoted in Saturday’s papers saying he’s enjoying his football again, but needs to start performing regularly. Quickness of thought hasn’t come back yet. 5.5

Kieran Richardson - Very narrow to begin with - obviously a ploy by the hosts - and got involved to good effect. Should have scored just after half-time. 7

Andreas Weimann - A late replacement for Gabby Agbonlahor, who was taken ill in the warm-up, and led the line alone. Couldn’t manufacture any meaningful opportunities. 6

Substitutes

Christian Benteke (on for Weimann after 61 minutes) - An aggressive arm round the neck from manager Paul Lambert as he entered the fray, Benteke was bang up for it. 6.5 

Jack Grealish (on for Richardson after 71 minutes)

Leandro Bacuna (on for N'Zogbia after 71 minutes)

Subs (not used): Ciaran Clark, Darren Bent, Carlos Sanchez, Shay Given

Manchester City 

Joe Hart - Didn’t have an awful lot to do, but made a decent stop to deny Richardson. 6

Pablo Zabaleta - Was unusually subdued in leaving his station at right back but is ever dependable going the other way. 6.5

Aleksandar Kolarov - Fierce effort smashed the post in the opening 10 minutes. Wicked delivery from the left as ever and almost crossed for Aguero to score. 7 

Vincent Kompany - Caught out by Delph out on the right which almost gave Villa the lead. Won his headers and stood firm, as you’d expect. 6.5

Eliaquim Mangala - Perhaps not his fault, but the central defender has an air of nervousness around him when on the ball. Did nothing wrong, which will come as a huge relief after Hull. 7

James Milner - Failed to really get at Cissokho as he should have done. A couple of whipped crosses to spark danger. 6.5

Tenacious as ever, James Milner (left) tries to get position on Ashley Westwood

Fernandinho - Laboured performance. Pellegrini needs to sort out who’s going to play alongside Toure. 5.5

Yaya Toure - Another strange one. Looked alive in flashes but then failed to deliver... All before a storming run and finish set City on their way to three points. 7

David Silva - Electric around the box. Jinking magician. Didn’t have much help in opening Villa up but was a constant threat. 7

David Silva is first to the ball as Westwood gets in tight - the Spaniard was electric around the box

Edin Dzeko - Often wasteful in front of goal and flashed a presentable opportunity wide. Didn’t look himself. 6

Sergio Aguero - Struck a post just after the break when he ought to have opened the scoring, but a constant threat in behind. Fabulous effort in the dying moments that zipped past Guzan. 7.5

Sergio Aguero was a constant threat and got his reward with City's second goal with an emphatic finish

Substitutes 

Frank Lampard (on for Fernandinho after 56 minutes) - Added urgency into the City midfield and is proving to be a very shrewd piece of business by the champions. 6.5

Fernando (on for Dzeko after 64 minutes) - Came on in order to push both Lampard and Toure further forward. Solid enough. 6

Jesus Navas (on for Silva after 84 minutes) - On too late to make an impact. 

Subs (not used): Bacary Sagna, Willy Caballero, Martin Demichelis, Stevan Jovetic
