A mother who chose to give birth to her baby despite being advised to abort him every fortnight throughout her pregnancy, sat beside his body for three days after he died just 19 minutes old.

The baby, who was named Charlie, suffered with Potter's Syndrome, a rare condition that affects the growth of the kidneys.

Doctors spotted the syndrome when expectant mother Carrie was 18-weeks pregnant, but she chose not to terminate her son’s life as he was otherwise developing normally and had a very strong
heartbeat.

Carrie Curtis, from West Yorkshire, gave birth to a son, Charlie, who died 19 minutes after birth. Doctors repeatedly urged her to terminate because he suffered with Potter's Syndrome, a condition that causes the kidneys to develop abnormally

Miss Curtis, 20, said: 'I wanted to give Charlie the best chance I life that I could. 

'I knew the chances of him surviving were almost nil but as long as he had a heartbeat, I wasn’t going to change my mind - no matter how many times doctors asked me if I was sure.

'I went for fortnightly checks and each time they asked if I wanted to terminate my pregnancy. They wouldn’t listen [to me].'

Potter's Syndrome affects around one in 30,000 babies. It stunts the growth of the baby's kidneys during the first few weeks of development in the womb. 

The baby's kidneys are essential for the production of amniotic fluid in the womb. 

If there are no kidneys, there is little or no amniotic fluid which causes a condition called  oligohydramnios.

The baby's kidneys are essential for the production of amniotic fluid in the womb.  

If there are no kidneys, there is little or no amniotic fluid which causes a condition called  oligohydramnios.

This prevents the  womb expanding and allowing the baby to grow and move. 

The womb remains small and in its confined space the baby's lungs cannot develop properly.  

Most babies with Potter's Syndrome are stillborn.  

In those born alive, the immediate 
cause of death is failure to breathe (respiratory failure) due to 
underdeveloped (hypoplastic) lungs, usually one or two days after 
delivery.

Even if this problem is treated the baby cannot survive without kidneys.

Even if this problem is treated the baby cannot survive without kidneys.

During her pregnancy, Miss Curtis prepared herself for the worst but when she gave birth to him on 
December 29 last year, in her 32nd week of pregnancy, she said he 
looked like any other newborn baby, despite weighing just 4lb.

Miss Curtis, from Leeds, said: 'It was a normal birth and I had a big team of people looking after me.

'As
soon as he came out, he was taken over to an incubator where they tried
to work. But his lungs were nearly non-existent and there was nothing 
they could do.

He passed away at 19 minutes. 

'They wrapped him in a towel and let me hold him while he slipped away.

'Charlie opened his eyes and looked at me, which will forever be a lasting moment for me,'Miss Curtis added.

Sadly, Miss Curtis never heard her 
son cry, but she was allowed to spend three precious days with her son 
at the Leeds General Infirmary.

She said: 'Charlie was so perfect and didn’t look any different to how he should have done.

'He was the right size and everything else had developed normally.

Carrie was 18 weeks pregnant with Charlie (pictured in 20-week scan) when he was diagnosed, but she chose not to terminate her son's life as he was otherwise developing normally and had a very strong heartbeat

'I knew his chances were slim but I was never going to give up on him and when I got to hold him in my arms, I was so pleased that I hadn’t.

'The hospital let me stay in a specially-adapted suite where parents who have lost children can go.

'I was allowed to hold him and be with him for as long as I wanted. At first it was hard because I expected him to open his eyes and be alright but as I was there longer, having the time with him was comforting.'

Miss Curtis now wishes to set up a charity to offer support to bereaved parents and raise awareness of Potter's Syndrome.

Miss Curtis and her family (from L-R: stepmother Ruth Curtis, father Gary Curtis, mother Sam Key and her partner Clive Key) are hoping to raise £100,000 to set up a charity to raise awareness of Potter's Syndrome

She claims she had little support once she left the hospital and hopes that the charity Charlie’s Angel Centre, can offer support to bereaved parents.

'I was getting all the after-effects of giving birth but I didn’t have the baby,' she said. 'I didn’t get any visits and there was no one to talk to about it. It was very overwhelming and scary.

'Charlie was my first child and I didn’t imagine it how it turned out. I didn’t know how long he would last and I didn’t know if I would miscarry.

'The fact that I knew he wasn’t going to live for very long when he was born meant I just had to get myself ready for that.'

Carrie and her family are hoping to raise £100,000 in order to set up the centre and offer support and help.

Carrie added: 'We want somewhere that people can call at 2am in the morning or just call in for a coffee and speak to someone, because you do feel like you’re going crazy.

'There isn’t enough awareness of Potter’s syndrome - not even the doctors really know what they’re dealing with and that needs to change.'
