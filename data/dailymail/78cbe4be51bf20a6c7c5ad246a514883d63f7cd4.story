Nick Clegg, pictured with his wife Miriam, sought to paint himself as an ordinary working husband during his speech

During his speech yesterday, Nick Clegg sought to paint himself as an ordinary working husband and family man.

Rather than moving to ‘live behind the Government battlements in Whitehall’ to carry out his role as Deputy Prime Minister, he was keen to highlight that he lives in the same house he has always done.

The 46-year-old Lib Dem leader was rather less forthcoming, however, about the fact his luxurious home also happens to be in one of London’s most sought-after areas.

He further tried to underline his ‘ordinary man’ credentials by hinting that he would quit within the next few years.

In a bid to convince voters that he is a normal person who is not obsessed by politics, he announced that he ‘will not be in politics forever’ so he can be ‘a father, a husband, a son, an uncle to all those I love’.

Despite having made much of his past pledges not to use his family to score points with voters, Mr Clegg repeatedly told anecdotes about his three sons, Antonio, 11, Alberto, eight, and Miguel, four.

He also boasted that unlike David Cameron, who lives in Downing Street, he and his wife Miriam had kept their family in Putney, South West London.

He said: ‘Miriam and I chose not to live behind the Government battlements in Whitehall. We try very hard to keep our family life normal and private – we keep our children away from the cameras.

‘We don’t pretend we’re a model family – we are who we are. We try to make sure Westminster doesn’t take over our lives.’

Unlike the other parties, he also declared, Lib Dems ‘speak like humans’.

He also joked about demands by Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott, an ally of Vince Cable, that he resign as leader.

‘I won’t be in politics forever. Matthew Oakeshott will be relieved. Only three or four elections to go,’ he said.

Aides said Mr Clegg would serve as party leader ‘up to, including and beyond the next general election’.

However, many think he will walk away from frontline politics if he does not succeed in taking the Lib Dems into government again.

Mr Clegg conceded: ‘My upbringing was privileged: Home Counties; private school; Cambridge University. I had a lot of opportunities.

'But I also had two parents who were determined that my brothers, my sister and I knew how lucky we were.’

Mr Clegg, who has previously attacked journalists who ask questions about his children’s schooling, then went on to tell how he and his wife use their summer trips to her home town in Spain to educate their sons about the political exploits of her father Jose Antonio Gonzalez Caviedes, a conservative senator who died in 1996.

‘Miriam tells them of the wonderful things he did.

'We teach them – just as my parents taught me – that rights and values should never be taken for granted, and if you believe in them, you should stand up for them.’

The Cleggs also have use of Chevening, in Kent - a 115-room grace-in-favour mansion

It may well be, as Nick Clegg was keen to point out, the same old family home he was living in before he become Deputy Prime Minister. But it is one most of us can only ever dream of.

The £1.5million home is in Putney, South West London, a rapidly-rising property hotspot and a stone’s throw from the picturesque Thames waterfront. 

But whenever Mr Clegg and his wife and sons feel like a change of scene, they have plenty of options. In winter, they have the run of his mother’s £7million, luxury 20-room mountain chalet near the exclusive Swiss resort of Klosters.

Meanwhile, his father’s ten-bedroom chateau near Bordeaux, in France, provides an idyllic summer escape. Then there is the grace-and-favour 115-room mansion, Chevening, in Kent, where the Cleggs entertain guests. 

While Mr Clegg’s £134,565 salary sounds more than comfortable to most mere mortals, it is dwarfed by his Spanish-born wife’s estimated £600,000 a year income as a commercial lawyer at the major US law firm Dechert.

The daughter of a Madrid senator, she is also a director of a Spanish building company.

Mr Clegg himself was raised in luxury in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, going to £19,000-a-year Caldicott prep school and then Westminster School. His maternal grandfather was a friend of the Dutch royal family and his banker father, Nicholas, is the son of a Russian-born baroness.
