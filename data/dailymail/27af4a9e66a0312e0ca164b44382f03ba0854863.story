A brother has been praised by police for saving his sister's life after she was stabbed repeatedly by a jilted gamer who flew to the UK to attack her.

Baby-faced Shane Coffey travelled from his home in Boston, Massachusetts to Farha Dowlut's house in Epsom, Surrey, after she ended their online relationship.

The 20-year-old smashed through her bedroom window and began stabbing Miss Dowlut, 19, in her bed with a hunting knife which he had smuggled into his luggage through customs.

But luckily, Miss Dowlut's brother Mohammad heard her anguished screams and ran to her rescue.

The 22-year-old wrestled Coffey away from his sister, also sustaining several wounds in the process. 

Even as the intruder continued to lash out, Mr Dowlut kept on pulling the attacker away from the bed.

He then hit Coffey three times around the head with a metal pole before he finally dropped the knife, saying 'stop, enough, I'm done.'

This week, Mr Dowlut was honoured for his bravery at Surrey Police's annual Chief Constable's Commendation Ceremony held at Guildford Cathedral.

Surrey Police said: 'Mohammed Dowlut tackled an armed offender who viciously attacked his sister in their home with a hunting knife.

'Mohammed sustained serious injuries in saving his sister's life. The offender was sentenced to life imprisonment for his attack.'

Coffey was jailed for life with a minimum term of eight-and-a-half years in November after pleading guilty at Guildford Crown Court to one count of attempted murder and another of grievous bodily harm.

The court had heard how Coffey and Miss Dowlut had first started chatting when she was aged 14, having met through the online gaming community. 

The pair had regularly spoken online but had stopped chatting after Coffey remotely hacked into Miss Dowlut's computer and read her chat logs with other people.

When they started talking again in November 2013, the pair discussed Coffey visiting Miss Dowlut at home. They exchanged Christmas gifts, which gave Coffey the family's address.

The gamer even checked into a Premier Inn (pictured) near to her home before scoping out the area, prior to the attack. Miss Dowlut's brother suffered injuries during the incident 

Coffey, who has been jailed for more than eight years, smuggled this hunting knife through customs

In March, after a big argument, Miss Dowlut told Coffey to 'get out of her life.'

But Coffey then secretly booked a flight to the UK. He arrived in April last year, having smuggled a Schrade combat and hunting knife in through customs, along with cable ties, tape and gloves.

He then scoped out Miss Dowlut's home after getting a taxi to the area. He then launched the frenzied attack.

Following the sentencing last November, Temporary Detective Chief Inspector Antony Archibald said: 'This was an extremely frightening incident for the family, carried out by a troubled man who carefully planned the attack with disturbing precision.

'We have no doubt that Coffey intended to kill that night and he may have done had it not been for the brave and courageous actions of the family members who stopped him.'
