Distress: A study, carried out by This Morning and Mumsnet, found that one in five British children suffers from 'school phobia', whereby children refuse to go to school due to emotional distress (stock image)

One in five British children suffers from 'school phobia' - but only half of parents are aware of the condition.

Children with the condition refuse to go to school due to emotional distress, but more than a third of schools do not address the issue.

Research found that one in 25 parents of those children who experience difficulty attending school have been accused of allowing their child to play truant.

Children aged five to six and 10 to 11 are most likely to be hit by the phobia, but there parents have experienced a lack of information.

Just 52 per cent of the 1,054 parents polled by This Morning and the parenting website Netmums were aware of the condition.

The condition often manifests itself in children faking illnesses on school mornings, used by 58 per cent of children who suffer.

A further 46 per cent became ill with genuine stress-related headaches and stomach aches, while half were 'very worried and distressed' the night before school.

More than a third of children with school phobia refused to leave the house on school mornings, and one-in-four would not walk through the school gates.

Among older children suffering, one in 50 say they are going to school but then do not turn up, while five per cent went into school for registration then left.

Being bullied was the most common cause of school phobia, with parents claiming it was the trigger behind almost a quarter of cases.

A further 23 per cent were caused by kids feeling they were not performing well enough at school while 19 per cent said their child was 'overwhelmed' by the size of their school.

This Morning agony aunt Denise Robertson 
added: 'I suffered badly from it and one of my sons did too. It is still
a much misunderstood condition and causes a lot of unhappiness, as I 
know from my postbag.'

Triggers: Being bullied was the most common cause of school phobia, with parents claiming it was the trigger behind almost a quarter of cases

But despite the widespread occurrence of the condition, parents are struggling to cope due to a lack professional help.

Only 48 per cent of parents had assistance from the school to help their child overcome the condition, while just one in 11 managed to obtain counselling for their child.

Instead, 20 per cent of parents resorted to waiting with their child in school every day until they settled, while 53 per cent talked through the issues at home until their child was more able to face school.

However, one in 16 parents move their child to another school in a bid to overcome it while one in 50 took the more radical step of home schooling their child.

Just three in 10 children who have been hit by school refusal have recovered completely, with 45 per cent of parents saying they still have problems getting their children to school.

Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said: 'School refusal is a devastating condition that blights the lives of both parents and children.

'It's incredibly stressful for parents to watch their children suffer and horrible for the children involved.

'There needs to be more awareness so schools realise these are not 'problem children' intent on truanting but pupils who have a deep-seated emotional fear of going to school.

'Schools and parents must do all they can to work together and ensure children are helped and supported so they don't miss vital months or years of schooling.'
