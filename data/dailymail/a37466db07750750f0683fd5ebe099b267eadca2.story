Lindsay Lohan just can’t seem to keep her nose out of trouble – and now a newly leaked document reveals that the actress was recently banned from a hotel over a $46,350.04 unpaid bill.

Lilo stayed in the upscale Chateau Marmont Hotel in West Hollywood during June and July of this year, all the while racking up heavy room service bills.

The star, who was last night spotted leaving the Wolfgang Puck Restaurant in New York, ordered up room service meals, cigarettes and regularly used the mini bar during her stay but failed to pay the hotel for their services, forcing the manager to ban her from the premises.

Sheer daring: Lindsay Lohan, who has been banned from Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, dined at Wolfgang Puck Restaurant in New York last night

Here comes trouble: The Mean Girls actress has been at the centre of plenty of drama this week

In a letter to Lindsay obtained by TMZ, hotel general manager Philip Pavel wrote to the troubled 26-year-old on July 31, reiterating their ‘repeated attempts to resolve’ the bill.

Philip writes: ‘As you are aware from our previous correspondences starting on July 8, you currently owe the hotel a grand total of $46,350.04 in charges for your stay starting on May 30, 2012.’

The general manager of the hotel also informed Lindsay that she would no longer be welcome on their premises.

Letter of intent: Lindsay Lohan has been banned from the Chateau Marmont after failing to pay a bill of $46,000

Big spenders: Chateau Marmont is frequented by some famous Hollywood names as a place to hang out

The letter continues: ‘As we have made repeated attempts to resolve this pressing matter over the last few weeks without any resolution, I regret to inform you that we will no longer be able to extend any further credit for you to remain in the hotel.

‘Please have all of your belongings removed from Suite 33 by 12:00PM, Wednesday, August, 1, 2012.’

Not only was Lindsay told that she would have to leave her suite at the hotel, she was also told that she could no longer use the facilities or eat in the popular restaurant.

The big bill: Lindsay failed to settle her debt with the hotel and was asked to remove her things from the suite

Money makes the world go round: Amongst the things Lindsay was charged for were garden services, mini bar and cigarettes

‘Furthermore, until we get the matter
of your outstanding debt paid, know that we will be unable to host you 
on property or in the restaurant.’

To perhaps coax Lindsay into paying 
her colossal bill, manager Philip Pavel even dismissed charges for 
rental use of a computer that Lindsay had been using.

Paying the price: The hotel removed a $75 daily cost for rental of a laptop as a sign of good faith

Long haul: The Machete star ran up the huge bill after staying at the hotel from 31 to May to 1 August

During Lindsay’s 47-day stay at the Chateau Marmont some of the things she spent money on included:

‘In regard to your bill, please note that I have adjusted off the daily $75 charge for computer rental for use of the hotel’s laptop as a gesture of good faith, with the understanding that you will return the computer upon your departure tomorrow.’

Lindsay was staying in the hotel while she filmed Liz & Dick – where she plays Elizabeth Taylor in the biopic of her life.

In recent years the troubled star has become more famous for her court appearances than her acting work, with Lindsay reportedly hoping that her performance in Liz & Dick will help save her ailing reputation.

No stranger to scandal, Lindsay was recently caught up in an alleged jewellery heist after being formally named as a suspect in a burglary – with reports now suggesting that she will not face prosecution after she claimed that she had been framed.

Mail Online have contacted both the Chateau Marmont and Lindsay Lohan’s representatives for comment but have not heard back.

The big bills: A total balance of $46,350.04 was left unpaid by Lindsay as the hotel banned her from their grounds

Expensive habit: Lindsay was charged for several packets of cigarettes almost on a daily basis
