Accused killer: Would-be mother Santos Elena Ruiz Santos has been charged with second-degree murder

A live-in housekeeper is accused of secretly giving birth to a baby girl, beating the infant and leaving it to die in a trash can at the Long Island mansion where she works.

Santos Elena Ruiz Solano, 26, delivered the little girl Sunday at the $1.4 million waterfront home in West Islip.

The baby suffered traumatic injuries and died at the scene, according to police.

Ruiz Solano then went to a local hospital to receive care after the birth, which is when the baby's remains were found in a nearby garbage can.

Ruiz Solano allegedly put the dead newborn in a plastic bag before throwing her into the bin at the home.

It is not clear who found the lifeless baby, and a Suffolk County Police spokesperson declined further comment when reached by MailOnline.

The exact nature of the baby's injuries was also not known by the spokesperson, who said the county medical examiner was performing an autopsy at the time of the call.

The mother was arrested Thursday at her modest home in nearby Central Islip.

Employment: It's not known how long Ruiz Solano worked at the mansion, pictured left and right, or whether she was legally able to work in the United States

According to property records, the luxury home is owned by Raymond Figalora, 69. His son, Raymond Figalora Jr., a senior home loan officer at Flagstaff Bank, is pictured enjoying the home's many features including its swimming pool on his Facebook page. Â 

A phone call to the New York residence went unanswered Thursday.

When reached by phone at another property in Port Saint Lucie, Florida, Figalora Jr. declined to comment, telling MailOnline, 'I don't know anything about this. Call up the district attorney's office and please don't call here again.'

Ruiz Solano was charged with second-degree murder and is expected to be arraigned Friday.
