Diane von Furstenberg has designed a new collection of fashionable frames and shades for Google Glass.

The American designer's 13 creations include rainbow-lensed glasses with a powder blue camera, simple brown square frames, and black tinted Aviator-style shades.

The accessories, which cost $1,620 per pair (the original Google Glass is priced at $1,500), will be available through the Google Glass website and Net-a-Porter starting on June 23.

Some of the DVF Made for Glass designs have prescriptive lenses, with subtle frames in black, brown or translucent pink.

And the sunglasses come in sleek polarized rainbow or black, with the DVF logo in the corner of the frames.

Ms von Furstenberg, 68, has long been a fan of the Google gadgets; she even had her models wear Glass down the runway during her spring 2013 fashion show.

She explains her fascination with the high-tech accessories in a video on Elle.com, saying: 'I'm old enough to have danced in Studio 54, and young enough not to have missed the digital revolution.'

She added that the ability to multitask while wearing Google Glass adds to its appeal.

'You can be driving and watching a movie,' she told WWD. '[I know] I probably shouldn't say that. The point is that you can be filming things while you're doing them.'

The collaboration marks the first time Google Glass has teamed up with a high-end designer.

But it's not Google's first attempt at injecting some much-needed fashion into the wearable technology.

In March, the company announced a collaboration with Italian fashion giant Luxottica, the parent company of Ray-Ban and Oakley, to design and develop a new style of eyewear.

Astro Teller, Google vice president, said in a statement: 'We are thrilled to be partnering with them as we look to push Glass and the broader industry forward into the emerging smart eyewear market.'
