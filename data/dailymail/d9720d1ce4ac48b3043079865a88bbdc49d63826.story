Legendary professional wrestler Jake 'The Snake' Roberts is in intensive care at a Las Vegas hospital after being collapsing on a flight as his body struggled against a reported 'double pneumonia' infection.

Friend and fellow former pro-wrestler Diamond Dallas Page tweeted that the WWE Hall of Famer was out of a coma but far from stable.

'Jake is now conscious but still fading in and out,' he wrote. 'Please keep the prayers coming.'

Roberts had gone from professional ruin and drug abuse to sobriety and elder statesman status in recent years

The Washington Post reports that Jake had recently ignored medical advice to seek treatment for his infection before his flight.

While some wrestlers rose to the top with Herculean physiques or outstanding feats of strength, Roberts made his name as a master of ring psychology.

In 1999 documentary 'Beyond the Mat,' peers praised his ability to connect with audiences on the microphone, or in the ring with just a simple, well-timed glare.

Fans who may not remember his matches almost certainly remember his python, Damien, who Roberts would carry to the ring with him in a burlap sack before unleashing the snake on a fallen opponent.

That same documentary also revealed how far Roberts had fallen, with the man who once entertained as man as 80,000 spectators a night reduced to smoking crack in cheap hotel rooms and performing in small town gymnasiums.

At the height of his fame, Roberts was known for his python, Damien, which would accompany him to the ring

But in recent years he seemed to have his life back on track.

He had become a devoted follower of Diamond Dallas Page's DDP Yoga program, which was given a lengthy profile this month in The New York Times, saying that the discipline saved him from a life where 'My daily workout was a crack pipe and a six-pack.â€™

After years in the professional wilderness, he was welcomed back to the WWE for an edition of 'Old School Raw' in January and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame the night before Wrestlemania XXX.

'I went through a lot in my life that scared me pretty good,' Roberts told the WWE's Zach Linder. 'I built a wall around myself to the point where nobody knew what was really going on inside of me, including myself.'
