A 'devoted' son who cared for his elderly mother is believed to have murdered her before killing himself amid fears his own health problems meant he would not have been able to continue looking after her.

The bodies of Stephen Dohoney and his mother Ethel, also known as Olwen, were discovered by neighbours at their home in Wythenshawe, Manchester.

Mr Dohoney, 55, was found hanged in the attic while his 86-year-old mother's body was discovered in her bed.

Investigation: Police were today continuing investigations at the house where a son is believed to have murdered the elderly mother he cared for before killing himself in a suspected murder-suicide

Detectives are treating the incident as a murder-suicide and are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths, it is understood.

According to reports, former civil servant Mr Dohoney had quit his job to care for his mother full time after she had started to suffer from a number of ailments in recent years.

But it is believed he himself had to undergo tests to diagnose a health problem amid fears he might have had cancer. He is said to have snapped over the level of 24/7 care he was providing for his mother at the end terraced home they shared for more than 40 years.

Officers were called to the house after a concerned neighbour made the gruesome discovery.

A police source said: 'We can’t be sure at the moment but the most likely scenario is that the 55-year-old resident has killed his mother and hanged himself.

'A concerned neighbour has let themselves in to check on them and found this horrific scene.

'The house was secure. There was no sign of a break in.'

Police were last night standing guard at the door of the neat corner terraced house on a small crescent.

Forensic officers could be seen going in and out carrying suitcases and taking photographs inside and outside the property.

Nearby resident Lee Gardener, 28, said: 'They were quiet and just went about their own business. There were no arguments or any trouble or anything like that.

'He was very devoted to his mother. It is a real shock'

'It was just the two of them in the house. She was quite small with permed hair. I did not see him as much but I do not think that he worked. It is just sad and my heart goes out to the family.

'Nobody wants something like this to happen around where they live. I think it is important not to judge because you do not know what goes on behind closed doors.

'We have heard that the man killed his mother then took his own life. It is just a tragedy.'

Another neighbour said the Dohoneys had lived in the house since 1972.

She added: 'He was very devoted to his mother. It is a real shock.'

Neighbour David Gage said: 'It’s a shock. She was a nice lady. She was friendly.

'She only came out of the house about once a month. She had been ill for a long time.'

Post-mortems were due to take place today.

'The community will be understandably concerned therefore we do have extra patrols in the area to offer some reassurance.

'A full investigation into the circumstances surrounding their deaths is now underway.'
