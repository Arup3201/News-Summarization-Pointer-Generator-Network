A man who swallowed a live goldfish in McDonald's as part of a sick drinking game has been banned from keeping animals.

Robert Atkinson, 20, was filmed buying a goldfish, taking it to the fast food outlet in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, dropping it into a pint of beer and downing the drink.

After finishing the beer he proclaimed 'I'm an animal'. The video was later uploaded to Facebook  as part of the NekNominate craze, in which people challenge one another to down bizarre, and in some cases lethal, alcoholic concoctions on camera.

Cruel: Robert Atkinson, 20, uploaded footage of himself drinking a live goldfish

Guilty: Atkinson admitted inflicting unnecessary harm on the fish

Atkinson, who is unemployed, was taken to court by the RSPCA along with his friend Lewis Summers, 19, who filmed the video.

The pair both admitted cruelty charges at Wakefield Magistrates' Court yesterday.

At the start of the cruel prank, Atkinson and Summers visit a Pets At Home store and buy the fish while boasting to a shop assistant about their plan.

Atkinson said: 'I'm going to call him Dmitri. I want a nice big one, we are going to eat it. I'll buy some chips with it.'

The two then head to McDonald's and drop the fish into a plastic cup of beer. Atkinson announces: 'Thanks for the NekNomination, this is a goldfish in beer.'

He adds: 'That trick usually works better when I've got my rabbit.' After swallowing the fish he says: 'I'm an animal'. 

'Sick humour': Robert Atkinson, left, and Lewis Summers, right, were both criticised by the judge, who said they 'still find' the video funny

The pair was prosecuted by the RSPCA, which received reports of the cruel video from concerned viewers who saw it on Facebook in February this year.

Atkinson admitted the charge of inflicting unnecessary harm to a protected animal, while Summers, admitted the aiding and abetting of cruelty.

In court yesterday the pair was given a three-year ban on keeping animals, and hit with more than £1,500 in fines, as the judge branded the dare 'simply sick humour'.

Prosecutor Andy Davidson, for the RSPCA, told the court: 'The video speaks for itself.'

Describing the NekNominate craze to the judge, Mr Davidson added: 'This type of challenge is well-known. It's a dare filmed and broadcasted for other people's entertainment.'

The craze took off in February this year, but quickly turned dark after three men died shortly after filming themselves drinking especially potent concoctions consisting of up to a pint of spirits such as gin and vodka.

Defence lawyer John Wilkinson told the court his clients hadn't known they were committing an offence when they made the video.

Plan: Atkinson said he made the video because he knew it would be popular. He was prosecuted by the RSPCA after online viewers reported the abuse

Sentencing them, District Judge Richard Clews told the pair: 'You might say this fish only met the sort of death it would have in the wild. You might say: "Well it's only a goldfish".

'Both of those notions miss the point. Apart from anything else, the more defenceless an animal is, the more culpable the abuse is of it.

'It may not be obvious that fish have the same feelings that a dog or cat has, but that does not mean that they are incapable of experiencing pain and it's certainly no justification for treating them like that.

'That creature died a deeply painful and wholly unpleasant death.'

The judge added: 'This was plainly planned to some degree and clearly deliberate. You filmed what happened and put it on a social media site.

The further aggravating feature is that you both found it so funny, and still find it funny now. That is quite simply sick humour.'

Atkinson and Summers were ordered to serve 40 hours of unpaid work and pay a £723 fine each, alongside a victim surcharge of £60.

Speaking outside court, Summers said: 'I was shocked when I got the call from the RSPCA. I didn't think it was a big issue with it being a small animal. I'm an animal lover myself and I didn't know I was committing an offence.

'I have thousands of followers on social media, and I posted the video because I knew it would go viral. Some people thought it was funny but there were a few who thought it was cruel. I did later decide to delete the video.'

RSPCA spokeswoman Gemma Fowler said: 'It's a horrible thing to do to a living animal, and I'm pleased that the courts have taken the same view.

'I hope that the sentence that's been handed down to the defendants acts as a deterrent and prevents this from happening again in future. It's shocking footage. The district judge was absolutely right.

'They showed a blatant disregard for that animal's life and welfare.'
