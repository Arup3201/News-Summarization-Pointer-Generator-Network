Most people dread a trip to the dentist and it was no different for this polar bear, who has had to endure an operation to remove her sore teeth.

The 11-month-old polar bear cub, who keepers have named Aurora, was discovered in Churchill in Manitoba, Canada, after her mother abandoned her in the wild.

She appeared unusually thin and during a routine exam vets discovered she had some broken teeth - which led to her transportation to Assiniboine Park Zoo in nearby Winnipeg.

Like a bear with a sore... mouth? A dentist reaches gingerly between the jaws of Aurora, an 11-month-old abandoned polar bear cub, who had to endure an operation to remove three teeth that were infected

This won't hurt a bit: Vets used general anaesthetic to subdue the otherwise fierce juvenile polar bear so they could remove two baby teeth and an adult tooth, which were broken and infected

A team headed by veterinary dentist Dr Colleen O'Morrow sedated the young bear before lying her out and removing two baby teeth and one adult tooth which was broken and infected.

Her recovery will take place at the newly constructed International Polar Bear Conservation Centre where staff hope to introduce Aurora to the zoo's latest polar cub addition - 11-month-old Kaska.

Dr Chris Enright, the zoo's head of veterinary services, said: 'In the wild this sort of tooth decay absolutely happens but in captivity we want to address it - we want her as comfortable and as healthy as she can be.

'This kind of dental surgery is much the same as working on humans but doing it on zoo animals adds a whole new complication.

'Right now she might only be about 110lbs but she still has the attitude of a 600lb predator - so it's certainly not safe to just ask her to open her mouth.'Â

Looks cute... But Dr Chris Enright said Aurora had the attitude of a 600lb polar bear

Dr Enright added that following the operation Aurora would quickly recover.

He said: 'She'll be back at the centre and within a few days she'll be back to her old self eating well and her new friend Kaska will provide her with some companionship and an outlet for all her energy.

'Aurora has already gained seven kilograms since arriving at the zoo so she is well on the way to recovery.'

Adult polar bears have 42 razor sharp teeth and their canines are larger and longer than any other bears.
