The France squad were given a warm welcome on their return to Paris on Sunday despite exiting the World Cup after a quarter-final defeat to Germany.

Didier Deschamps and his players were greeted by more than 200 fans at Le Bourget airport just outside the French capital, two days after Mats Hummels' header had given Joachim Low's side a 1-0 win in Rio.

That result didn't stop Les Bleus supporters giving Paul Pogba and Co a rousing reception after touching down on home soil, following wins over Honduras, Switzerland and Nigeria in Brazil.

The scene was in huge contrast to the last World Cup, when some players went on strike in South Africa and caused national embarrassment.

The current squad, which did not include many of the players involved at the 2010 tournament, restored some pride with their impressive performance against the Swiss and respectable behaviour away from the pitch.

Stars including Karim Benzema, Hugo Lloris and Raphael Varane signed autographs and chatted with fans before heading on their way.

Each member of Deschamps' squad will be given some time to relax and recover before joining up with their respective clubs for pre-season training.

'We are proud of what they did, what they accomplished and we've very proud that their new image has erased the past. This is a great team,' said Melanie Petit, who was among the supporters at the airport.
