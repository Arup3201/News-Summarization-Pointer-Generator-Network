It was billed as the tough cop-tough cop double team – veteran Miriam O’Callaghan and rising star Claire Byrne – that would wring the truth out of the protagonists in the big stories of the day. 

But the first controversy of RTÉ’s revamped current affairs flagship Prime Time pitched the two hosts against each other – and it was the younger woman who came off the winner. 

Both main anchor Miriam and newcomer Claire arrived for the first show wearing red.

But in a breach of protocol and good manners, which observers say should have meant the younger woman being asked to change what she was wearing, sources have revealed that it was Miriam who was asked to change her outfit.

RTÉ insiders have told the Irish Mail on Sunday that producer David Nally asked Miriam to change her clothes.

‘David came onto the studio floor and said, “Girls, you are both in red”. He turned to Miriam and asked her would she change her outfit. Miriam appeared not too happy and basically said, “Are you serious?” But she went ahead and changed.’

RTÉ have played down the incident, a spokeswoman saying that Miriam changed because she was wearing a red jacket and it was easier for her to swap outfits.

‘Claire and Miriam were dressed in similar colours, variations on red and pink. Claire had a red dress and Miriam was wearing a pinky-red jacket. We shot the promo [a short publicity clip promoting what would be on the programme later that evening] but it didn’t look right with the women in similar colours,’ she said.

‘As Miriam was wearing a jacket, it was logical to ask her just to take it off. And she did so professionally and without any fuss at all. There was no issue.’

However, sources in RTÉ say Miriam was less than happy at being asked to change. The on-set exchange has become the talk of Donnybrook.

Industry sources have also remarked that Miriam subsequently went on air in a blue blouse that made her almost invisible against the blue screen backdrop in the Prime Time studio.

‘Television rules dictate that you never wear the same colour as the background because the person basically disappears,’ said one. ‘If you look at the pictures of Miriam she is not clearly defined from the waist up as her blue blouse blends in with the blue screen behind her. In contrast, Claire’s red dress really stood out.’

It is understood that RTÉ presenters are no longer dressed from the station wardrobe but now wear their own clothes on air. This can give rise to co-presenters turning up in similar styles or colours, causing clashes – though the station’s conservative culture appears not to apply the same stricture to its hordes of ­sombre-suited male presenters.

When it was announced last month that Miriam was to be joined by Claire and Pat Kenny in a merger of Prime Time and The Frontline, Miriam said she was delighted to welcome her new ­ co-anchors. 

‘I’m really looking forward to working with both of them. I know Claire well and we’ve done different events together. But it’ll be great to have two women in the Prime Time studio,’ she said at the time of the announcement. 

Reaction to the new format has been broadly positive but RTÉ has yet to release figures.

Mother-of-eight Miriam has presented Prime Time since 1996 and has made the current affairs show her own. 

However, Claire, 36, is seen as RTÉ’s star-in-waiting and has been given experience in a variety of roles and formats, including a short run hosting The Daily Show with Daithí Ó Sé. 

She also has her own show on RTÉ Radio 1 at lunchtime on Saturdays.

Approached by the MoS, she declined to comment about the colour clash, while Miriam also said ‘no comment’ when contacted.
