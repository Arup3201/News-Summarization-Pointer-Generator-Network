Couples in long-distance relationships might already use their phones to send raunchy photo messages to one another but now smartphones can be used to keep the passion alive in a new way.

Underwear featuring a wearable massager that can be controlled by a partner using an app, has been unveiled at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.

The blueMotion vibrator was created to bring couples closer using smartphones, who might otherwise ignore each other and pay more attention to emails and text messages.

The smart underwear features a Bluetooth
 enabled massager that can vibrate in unlimited patterns and promises to
 be 'completely discrete'.

‘For some couples, the explosion of the digital age has resulted in a shift in intimacy, as many pay more attention to devices than their partners,’ said Suki Dunham founder of OhMiBod.

‘blueMotion breaks down those virtual barriers by encouraging couples to interact both physically and emotionally using technology.

'They can experience the thrill of unlimited vibration patterns and total discretion whenever the mood arises.’

The lightweight blueMotion device, which can be 
fitted inside underwear, has a motor that is controlled by an app for 
Android and iOS smartphones in numerous ways.

It connects to a smartphone via the 'remote' app to make use of phone features including the accelerometer, touch screen, and
 volume controls to operate the massager.

Sound clips can be recorded using the app, which generates vibrations though the device based on a partner’s voice or a favourite song.

The company says that the number of vibration patterns that can be created is limitless.

The massager will go on sale in March 2014 and retail for $129.
