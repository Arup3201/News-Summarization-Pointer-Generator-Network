Wearing a Savile Row suit, designer shoes and a luxury brand watch, Prince Harry looked every inch the royal at a reception at St James's Palace earlier this week.

But despite spending around £8,000 on his outfit for the day, it has been revealed he topped off the look with a pair of bargain bin golf socks, which cost just £1.66 a pair.

The Prince hosted an engagement with New York Knicks basketball star Carmelo Anthony on Wednesday in aid of the Core Coach programme, an apprentice scheme run for jobless young people by the Royal Foundation.

Despite Prince Harry spending £8,000 on the rest of his outfit for an engagement at St James's Palace earlier this week, it was revealed he was wearing bargain golf socks, which cost just £1.66 a pair. 

Not to be outdone, basketball star Carmelo Anthony, who joined Prince Harry at the event, also made a statement with his socks by wearing a brightly yellow and blue pair 

Harry dressed smartly wearing a bespoke Savile Row suit and shirt thought to cost around £3,690.

He was also wearing personalised John Lobb leather shoes worth £1,500 and a £3,150 Breitling watch, according to the Sun.

But when the 30-year-old sat down for an official photo with the sports star, he revealed his black Dunlop golf socks, which can be bought in a pack of three for just £5.

Not to be outdone, Mr Anthony, wearing a checked black suit, also made a statement with his socks, wearing a brightly coloured yellow and blue pair.

At the reception in aid of the Royal Foundation's Coach Core programme, Harry was presented with his own personalised basketball shirt 

The Prince and the sportsman burst into fits of laughter when the royal was also presented with a single orange shoe 

The palace reception saw Harry make his first public appearance of 2015, and the Prince appeared to enjoy the company of the six foot eight inch sportsman, despite him towering over the six foot two inch royal.

And the fashion theme continued when Mr Anthony presented Harry with his own personalised training shirt with the name Wales on the back.

However, the pair burst into fits of giggles when the Prince was given a single orange shoe.

Still chuckling, he promptly told a smiling Anthony that he would have to come to his upcoming game in London to collect the other one. 'And I love the shirt,' he added.

The duo were joined for the reception by Congolese basketball star Dikembe Mutombo, 48, who, at 7ft 1", towered over Anthony as well, and British basketball player John Amaechi.

The pair appeared to enjoy each other's company at the event earlier in the week with Harry standing on his toes to try and appear as tall as his guest, right 

And speaking to the 33 newly qualified sports coaches who were trained via the programme, Harry said: 'This is not where it ends but where it starts.

'When my brother, Catherine and I launched the Coach Core programme back in 2012, we had a vision of young people being inspired to become amazing sports coaches for their communities and beyond: Young people, who would in turn, inspire others to change their lives through sport.

'Like many others, we had been profoundly moved by the excitement of the London Olympics - a celebration of sporting achievement.

'Of course, this level of excellence is only possible through an immense amount of hard work by the athletes, their coaches, mentors and all those who support them on their journey to greatness.'
