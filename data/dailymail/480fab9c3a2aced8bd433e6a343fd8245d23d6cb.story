The Duchess of Cambridge will not travel to Malta this weekend for her first official solo overseas royal visit because she continues to suffer with extreme morning sickness.

Kate, 32, who is around eight weeks pregnant with her second child with husband, Prince William, has been suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum - a severe vomiting condition.

The illness saw Kate hospitalised in the early weeks of her pregnancy with her first baby, Prince George, now one.

The pregnant Duchess of Cambridge (last pictured with Prince William on August 5) will not travel to Malta this weekend for her first solo overseas royal visit  after continuing to suffer from severe bouts of morning sickness

Kensington Palace today confirmed the Duchess would not travel to Malta this weekend with a statement which said she 'continues to suffer from the effects of hyperemesis gravidarum'.

The Duchess had been due to represent the Queen on a two-day visit to the Mediterranean island as Malta celebrates the 50th anniversary of its independence from Britain. 

However, the palace confirmed today that Prince William would instead take her place.

In a statement, the palace said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge will no longer visit Malta this weekend. The Duke of Cambridge will undertake the visit instead.

'Her Royal Highness continues to suffer from the effects of hyperemesis gravidarum. The decision not to travel was taken by the Duke and Duchess on the advice of the Duchess's doctors.

'The Duke is honoured to represent Her Majesty The Queen on the visit, which commemorates the 50th anniversary of Malta's independence.

'The visit itinerary remains unchanged.'

Royal sources earlier told the Mail that the Duchess wanted to wait until the last possible minute to decide whether she was medically fit to go. Her decision came after a consultation with doctors last night. 

Despite being 'desperate' to attend her first royal overseas appointment, the Duchess reluctantly agreed to cancel after meeting with Alan Farthing, surgeon-gynaecologist to the Royal Household, and her obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston at Kensington Palace.

Her pregnancy has not yet passed the 12-week stage but there is speculation that the royal couple's second child could be due in April.

Hyperemesis gravidarum affects about 15 per cent of all pregnancies.

The condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘pregnancy hormone’ HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases after conception. 

It causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine, called ketosis.

It is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers.

The severe dehydration puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients and sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day, with exhausting and hazardous consequences.

They cannot eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week.

It can trigger a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food.

Hyperemesis sufferers can also experience acid reflux, where stomach acid keeps repeating up the throat.

Hospital treatment for these women is essential, as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated.

Treatment typically includes an injection of the drug heparin to protect against blood clots triggered by dehydration, as well as supplementation of vitamin B, one of the vitamins most depleted by the condition.

An intravenous infusion of saline for rehydration is standard practice. 

The condition can also affect the baby’s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight. In severe cases, the sickness can trigger a miscarriage. 

The foreign trip had been seen as being a sign of Kate's growing royal role, not least because the island holds such a special place in the Queen's heart.

The monarch spent many happy months there before she acceded to the throne when her husband, Prince Philip was stationed there with the Royal Navy.

Highlights of the eagerly anticipated trip were a visit to the national library to see letters from past British monarchs Henry VIII and George II, Independence Day celebrations and a number of walkabouts.
