The New York World's Fair of 1964 introduced 51 million visitors to a range of technological innovations and predictions during its run.

Fifty years later, some of those ideas have turned out to be commonplace in our world, such as video phone calls and asking computers for information.

But some of them -  colonies on the moon and jet packs as a mode of everyday transportation - remain firmly on the drawing board.

WHAT THEY HAD WRONG

Colonies on
 the moon, underwater and in Antarctica

The Futurama 2 ride at the fair was sponsored by General Motors and 
presented a possible vision of the world 60 years into the future.

Designed by Norman Bel Geddes, it showcased it included scenes of colonies on the moon 
as well as in Antarctica, huge underwater dwellings, moving sidewalks,  computer-guided cars zipping along congestion-free highways and a machine that 
used a laser to cut through rainforests, leaving behind paved roads.

The vision even had undersea vacationing with holidaymakers taking a break at Hotel Atlantis deep in the sea.

It also had jet packs, demonstrated by men who wore them and 
zoomed around the grounds, but which remain a mode of transport found primarily in science fiction.

The
 exhibit, which visitors rode through on a ride train, proved to be the 
most popular exhibit at the World's Fair - waiting lines were often at 
least two hours long.

For the men who lived on the moon? Also on the Futurama 2 ride at the 1964 World's Fair was this prediction of what a lunar colony might look like

WHAT THEY HAD RIGHT

Picturephone

At the Bell System pavilion, engineers
 touted a 'picturephone' that allowed callers to see who they were 
talking to, a concept that lives on in modern-day apps such as Skype and
 FaceTime.

At the time,
 though, picture phones didn't take off, said Lori Walters, history 
professor at the University of Central Florida.

She attributed that to 
high setup costs that made them accessible to relatively few.

And at a time when many men attended the fair in coat and tie and women
 in dresses, people weren't quite ready to be seen on the phone at any 
hour, in their pajamas or worse.

'We were still a little more of a formal society,' Walters said.

Touch-tone phones

Other new Bell technologies included the touch tone phones as opposed the traditional rotary dial. Known as the 'push button' originally
 introduced at the Seattle World's Fair in 1962, this was still the 
first time many visitors were exposed to this technology.

Personal use of the computer

The
 fair also gave wide exposure to the power of computers, which at the 
time were seen as huge cabinets of blinking lights and electrodes 
operated by big corporations.

At
 the IBM pavilion, visitors saw a computer system in which a machine 
took in a card with a date written on it and gave back another card with
 a news story from that date.

At the NCR pavilion, a computer would answer scientific questions or give out recipes from a cookbook.

'I
 don't think it's a stretch to say in a lot of ways this fair was key to
 familiarising people with and really normalizing the concept of working
 with computers,' said Ryan Ritchey, a Philadelphia filmmaker who's 
making a documentary about the fair.

Robotics

Another
 bit of technology (along with an annoyingly hard-to-forget song) was 
introduced by Walt Disney with the It's a Small World attraction: 
robotic animation.

That
 'animatronic' exhibit and three others, including one featuring a 
robotic President Abraham Lincoln, showed characters moving in lifelike 
ways, including smiling and blinking.

'This
 is the first time that millions of people had the opportunity to see 
something that could be described as robotic.

The special effects you 
could see in the World's Fair blew away what you could see in the 
movies,' said Joseph Tirella, author of a book about the fair.

Regardless
 of whether such notions survived, observers say the fair offered a 
vision of the world's potential that made it seem like anything was 
possible.

'It really seems like 50 years ago, we had more exciting visions for 50 years in the future than we do now,' Mr Ritchey said.

Ford Mustang

The two-seater sports car with its long hood and short rear deck was officially unveiled by Lee Iacocca, head of the Ford division, at the World's Fair, just four days before the April 17 public introduction.

Ford predicted its newly-introduced  $2,368 model - touted as 'the car that dreams are made of' - would sell about 100,000 cars.

More than 400,000 Mustangs were sold that year and it has remained in production ever since with Ford selling more than nine million Mustangs.

Held at Flushing Meadows Corona Park 
in Queens the show ran for two, six month periods between 1964 and 1965 -
 its theme was 'Peace Through Understanding' and was intended to be a 
celebration of American industry.

It
 was previously held in 1853 and 1939 and a group of New York businessmen brought
 it back for 1964 in a bid to recapture the past for the children and 
grandchildren.

Admission
 was $2 for adults and $1 for children and one of the key attractions was 
the Unisphere, an enormous stainless steel model of the Earth that 
reached 12 storeys high.
