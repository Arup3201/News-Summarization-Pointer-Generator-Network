Another of Donald Sterling's offensive rants has been caught on tape - this time a profanity-laced voicemail to his doctor in which he calls the man 'stupid,' 'incompetent' and a 'tramp.'

The disgraced former LA Clippers owner directed a barrage of abuse at Dr. James Spar, one of the psychiatrists who performed medical tests on him recently, and the recording was used by Shelly Sterling's lawyers in court today to show her estranged husband's menacing behavior.

In the tape, obtained by TMZ Sports, Sterling explodes at the doctor after he determined he was mentally incompetent.

'I'm not incompetent, you're incompetent ... you stupid f***ing doctor!!!' he can be heard saying, before threatening to call UCLA and have Dr. Spar fired immediately.

Sterling also left a nasty voicemail for the other psychiatrist who evaluated him.

'You
 released my medical records of my head to a law firm without my 
permission. And you came in and you purported to examine me and you 
never told me anything about it,' he says to the female shrink, who 
hasn't been identified.

'You're
 nothing but a fraud and liar and a cheat and I'm gonna see that you 
lose your license... and I'm suing you for conspiracy,' he screamed.

The
 vendettas come after the doctors agreed Sterling was unfit to run the 
Clippers' business affairs because he is 'suffering from cognitive 
impairment, secondary to primary dementia (and) Alzheimer's disease.'

Shelly
 Sterling's lawyers used the voicemails in court Wednesday, but they 
didn't help her case. The judge just rejected her request for an 
injunction against Donald and his attorneys.

Shelly Sterling's attorneys filed a petition Thursday alleging threats by Donald Sterling and his counsel,

But
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Levanas ruled in writing that 
the statements cited in the petition did not 'rise to the level of great
 and irreparable injury.'

The
 judge also commented that the case may involve 'high emotions and some 
litigation posturing' and he asked all parties to tone down their 
pretrial communications.

A
 trial next month will look into assertions that Donald Sterling is 
mentally incapacitated, leaving Shelly Sterling as sole authority to 
sell the Clippers to determine if Shelly 
Sterling can sell the Clippers to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for
 $2 billion.

A person with knowledge of 
the legal proceedings told The Associated Press that the urgent request 
sought protections for witnesses including the doctors who may be 
witnesses in next month's scheduled trial.

Shelly
 Sterling's deal with Ballmer was struck after Donald Sterling's racist 
remarks to a girlfriend were recorded and publicized.

The NBA moved to 
oust him as team owner, fined him $2.5 million and banned him for life.

O'Donnell
 said doctors determined the 80-year-old Donald Sterling was mentally 'incapacitated' thereby making her sole administrator of the family 
trust, which owns the team, according to its terms. Donald Sterling is 
fighting that contention and her authority to sell.

The deal would be 
record breaking if approved by the NBA's owners.

Donald Sterling 
is also suing the NBA for $1 billion in federal court and alleges the 
league violated his constitutional rights, committed breach of contract 
and violated antitrust laws.

He has hired four private investigations 
firms to dig up dirt on the NBA's former and current commissioners and 
its owners, according to a person familiar with Donald Sterling's legal 
strategy.
