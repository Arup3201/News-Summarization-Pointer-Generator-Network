A former Apple CEO who allegedly fired Steve Jobs in the 1980s from the company he founded has been accused of hiding his fortune during a divorce battle.

John Sculley, who clashed with Jobs during his tenure at the tech giant, allegedly signed over investments worth $25million to his brothers to avoid them being claimed by Carol 'Leezy' Sculley.

Sculley, who spent ten years at the helm of the tech company, finalized his divorce in 2011, having claimed their combined worth was just $4.8million, Page Six reported.

But his ex-wife claims that he had in fact been squirreling away assets more than a decade in advance, after starting an affair with a former Apple colleague in 2000.

According to filings from 2013 seen by Page Six, Sculley asked his brothers Arthur and David to take on assets for him by starting a joint investment firm called Sculley Brothers - charges Sculley denies.

The filing, made in Palm Beach, Florida, in 2013, accuses Sculley of lying to court. It then alleges he 'submitted a false financial affidavit . . . and failed to fully and honestly disclose his assets.'

Those assets are later described as 'substantial private equity investments and investments in privately held companies and ventures around the globe'.

Some estimates say that Sculley is worth as much as $200million in total.

His ten-year career at Apple saw some of its least successful products - including an iPad forerunner called Newton - and is viewed as a decline ahead of its resurgence in recent years.

Sculley has previously spoken about his sometimes-fractious relationship with Jobs, which came to a head in a dispute over the pricing of the Apple Macintosh computer.

Jobs wanted it to be cheap to drive sales and interest, while Sculley wanted to keep the price higher to protect its other products and defend the company's bottom line.

Sculley, who also defended his tenure at the company, said in 2012: '[Apple] was the most profitable computer company in the world - not just personal computers - and Apple was the number one selling computer.

'So the myth that I fired Steve wasn't true and the myth that I destroyed Apple, that wasn't true either.'

A representative for Sculley refuted the claims.

He told DailyMail.com: 'The reality is that this case has been in the court of law for a number of years, and leaking false items to the media in a desire to pressure Mr. Sculley into settling this case is despicable.

'There is zero truth to these allegations. Mr. Sculley is confident this case will result in a full vindication for him.'
