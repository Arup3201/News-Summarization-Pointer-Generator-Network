A Senate candidate in Iowa has used the tragic murder of his sister as a justification for the right to bear arms in a campaign video, during which he threatens to use both his gun and a knife.

Bob Quast is running as an Independent in the race and introduces himself as a father, a term-limits advocate, and a brother looking for revenge.

‘If you are the sexual predator and sociopath who murdered my sister Lynette and you come to my front door to do harm to my girls, I'm going to use my Glock to blow your balls off,’ he says while smiling into the camera.

The ‘sociopath’ in question is his former brother-in-law Thomas Craft who pled guilty to killing his wife Lynette, Quast’s sister, in 1999.

Making himself clear: Quast is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment

The couple lived in Ohio but pieces of Lynette’s body were found at various points around Ann Arbor, Michigan- including a part of a leg at a McDonald’s and other body parts in a trash can in a different part of town.

Business Insider reports that Craft was released from prison in 2011 as a result of a plea deal and is living at a halfway house in Ohio.

Quast mentions his sister’s murder only 20 seconds into the minute-long video, and moves on quickly to talk about how presumed Democratic candidate Congressman Bruce Braley  and other ‘liberals… want to restrict our gun rights’.

This is the second shocking ad to come
 out of the race to fill the open seat in Iowa, as Republican candidate 
Joni Ernst previously released a video where she touts her years 
castrating pigs on an Iowa farm, saying that ‘when I get to Washington, 
I’ll know how to cut pork’.

Quast
 makes a reference to Ersnt’s ad in an effort to differentiate himself 
as the Independent in the race, whipping out a gun and playing a quick 
clip of a squealing pig that was used in Ernst’s ad as part of his own.

Speaking
 directly to camera, he calls for an open debate before the primary and 
tells Braley ‘you have nothing to fear as we are friendly folks here in 
Iowa,’ holding up his Glock in one hand and a knife in another.

Laughing matter? Quast jokes that Iowans are 'a friendly people' while holding up his Glock and a knife

‘I will leave my gun at home. Joni can leave her knife on the farm, as long as you agree to leave your elite law degree in D.C.,’ he says.

‘We’ll just use our brains to debate your reckless laws and taxes like Braley-care, including common sense solutions to clean up your messes.’

Quast, a former Army contractor, signs out by touting the fact that he never went to law school.

‘My new video truly addresses issues in Iowa while retaining a sense of humor,’ Quast later told The Des Moines Register.
