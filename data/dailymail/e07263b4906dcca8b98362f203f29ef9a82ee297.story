This is the tender moment an elephant sprayed his handler, a Mahout, with water as Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary in India reopened to tourists following devastating floods.Some 236 tourists visited Pobitora in the northeastern state of Assam, India, on Friday. Both elephants and jeeps took visitors on safari in the sanctuary. Pobitora was one of a number of parks in Assam that was hit by severe floods earlier this year.

One rhino caught in high floods in Pobitora was killed by poachers and another was swept away in strong currents. The rhino, which was stranded in a sandbar for almost a week, was later rescued.

Forest minister Rockybul Hussain, who opened the sanctuary for visitors, said: 'Over the years, there has been a rise in the flow of visitors to Pobitora. Tourism infrastructure has improved significantly to attract more visitors to the sanctuary.'

'We are also in the process of engaging more elephants from private owners in due course of time for the tourists. This time, visitors can also enjoy boating,' said a sanctuary official.

Pobitora has 93 rhinos, making it one of the most high density rhino habitats in the world. Last year, 18,779 Indian tourists and 207 foreign visitors came to the sanctuary.

The floods this year were some of the worst Assam has seen in eight years. The Kaziranga National Park and the Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park, both in the state, have also reopened for tourists.

Kaziranga National Park has lost almost 700 animals since June.
