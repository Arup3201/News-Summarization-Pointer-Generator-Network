Can easyJet’s Stelios do for gyms what he’s done for planes? He’s trying to. This month saw the launch of the eighth easyGym, its flagship branch in a space formerly occupied by a Virgin Active in London’s Oxford Street.

But while Virgin membership cost £70 a month, easyGym is just £19.99 (in the new London branch — the others cost from £15.99 a month), with no joining fee or contract.

Sounds too good to be true? If easyGyms are anything like easyJets, I expect them to be sweaty, cramped and full of hidden costs.

Claire Coleman puts easyGym's latest offering to the test and aside from the orange colour scheme and prison-style changing rooms, she is more than impressed

Indeed, the price you see isn’t necessarily the price you pay. Fancy doing classes? It’ll cost you an extra £11.99 a month. Want to watch TV on the treadmill? That’s another £1.99 per month.

Inside, it’s orange and functional. I hadn’t expected piles of fluffy towels, but it seems privacy comes at a premium, too.

Claire was amazed by the exercise machines, saying they had the most sophisticated entertainment system she'd ever seen in a gym

The changing rooms are communal with the barest of facilities — like a prison. With just ten showers and about 300 lockers, I’d expect queues.

But then I step onto the gym floor and my jaw drops. I’d assumed they’d have kept all the old Virgin stuff and painted the place orange but there’s more than 14,500 sq ft of space, packed with new high-quality machinery and fitness gear.

The main machines feature the most sophisticated entertainment system I’ve ever seen in a gym. Not only can you choose from more than 70 TV channels, but you can surf the web and plug in your iPod to watch your own films.

Every exercise craze is catered for, from a Power Plate to BOSU balls (air-filled domes used for balancing).

There are group induction sessions every hour, but a personalised programme with a trainer will cost at least £25.

And they know their stuff. Manny Saul, who puts me through my paces, trained a 2012 Olympic wrestler and promises me a ‘head-turning, curvy, Coke-bottle body’ in three weeks (if I give up booze).

The trainers really know their stuff here and Manny Saul put Claire through her paces

It’s impressive and if I worked locally, I’d be tempted to join, although let’s see if it’s quite so shiny in a few months’ time.

Ultimately I applaud Stelios for opening up the world of high-spec gyms to a wider audience.

Although, while I’m at it, might I suggest that the man himself could benefit from a session or two with Manny?

Claire was ultimately really impressed by the new gym, which has taken over Virgin Active's old space
