Arsenal have announced Europcar as the club's official car and van rental partner.

Fresh from their convincing Community Shield win over Manchester City at Wembley on Sunday, the Gunners have agreed a three-year deal with Europe's leading car rental company.

As part of the deal, Europcar's branding will be displayed at the Emirates during Premier League and domestic cup matches. The company will also help fans travelling to away games throughout the season.

Done deal: Calum Chambers, Wojciech Szczesny and Kieran Gibbs help announce Arsenal's new partnership

Arsenal's Sales and Marketing Director Vinai Venkatesham welcomed the agreement.

He said: 'We are delighted to be partnering with Europcar for the next three years. We are already working closely together to develop engaging marketing campaigns targeted at football fans all around the world.'

Europcar's Managing Director Ken McCall, meanwhile, explained the benefits of the partnership.

He said: 'This is a tremendously exciting partnership for Europcar. It gives us fantastic branding opportunities within the UK, and also reaching millions of football fans who follow the Premier League throughout the world.

'As well as promoting the Europcar global brand message, ‘Moving Your Way’, the partnership also gives us access to the players and player imagery for our own promotional activity.

'As the official car and van rental partner of Arsenal, we can help fans travelling to away games with convenient and cost-effective mobility solutions, as well as bring the benefits of our comprehensive range of services tailored to the needs of business and leisure users.
