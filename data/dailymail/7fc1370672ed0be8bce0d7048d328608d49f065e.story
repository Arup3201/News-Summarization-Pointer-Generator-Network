what is different about what the Alexandru brothers did was that rather than simply recreate one photo they choose to do a whole selection of 16 images from their childhood

According to Toma, 29, left, he hit upon the idea several months ago and since then he and Paul, 26, right, together with some friends have been spending their weekends visiting old haunts to recreate the memories of the past

But what is different about what the Alexandru brothers did was that rather than simply recreate one photo they choose to do a whole selection of 16 images from their childhood.

According to Toma, 29, he hit upon the idea several months ago and since then he and Paul, 26, together with some friends have been spending their weekends visiting old haunts to recreate the memories of the past.

He estimates that they travelled 1,000 miles as they drove from their home in Bucharest to places they used to visit as kids such as Sinaia, Peles Castle and Busteni.

As well as the brother they had some friends come along to help, one to take the photos and one whose job it was to hold an ipad featuring copies of the old photo for reference.

Fortunately the family still live in the same apartment in Bucharest and so several of the photos could be recreated at home including Toma's favorite which shows his brother asleep by his bed with the feet on the floor and his head on the bed

'That one was the most fun,' said Toma. 'When my brother was young he got up in the middle of night to get some water and he was so tired that he fell asleep with only half of him in the bed.' In the updated photo the brothers added a vodka bottle for their amusement

It was their mom's 55th birthday on October 23 and the family held a small party to celebrate

It was their mom’s 55th birthday on October 23 and the family held a small party to celebrate.

At the family event the boy presented her with the extra special present that they had gone to a lot of effort to put together, a photo album containing all the photos from her boys.

Needless to say Mrs Alexandru was so touched by her present that she cried when she looked back the photos and all the effort they had gone to make her feel so special.
