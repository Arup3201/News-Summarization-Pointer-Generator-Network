Additional details have emerged about the Pennsylvania boy accused of stabbing 21 people at Franklin Regional High School earlier this month.

Alex Hribal, 16, is revealed to have written a note saying he couldn't wait to see the 'helpless looks' on students' faces when they realize 'their precious lives are going to be taken' and that he fought off students who tried to stop him.

'No, I am not dropping them (knives), my work is not done I have more people to kill,' Hribal was overheard saying by Vice Principal Samuel King, according to an affidavit cited by KDKA.

Police say the note was found in Alex Hribal's locker. They say it was dated April 6, three days before the rampage at the school near Pittsburgh.

Details about the note are contained in the criminal complaint filed Friday against Hribal that increases the number of attempted homicide charges he faces to 21, up from four.

'I can't wait to see the priceless and helpless looks on the faces of the students of one of the 'best schools in Pennsylvania' realize their precious lives are going to be taken by the only one among them that is a plebeian,' the note said, according to the affidavit.

Investigators also confirmed they believe Hribal was targeting specific students, and even called one the night before the stabbing spree and said he would 'f**k them up.'

No motive has yet been provided by authorities in the April 6 attack that reportedly saw Hribal run through the school wielding two eight-inch kitchen knives.

The horrific rampage left 20 students and a security guard either stabbed or slashed. One student reportedly almost died after one of the knives missed his heart by by only fractions of an inch.

Two of the wounded students remain hospitalized.
