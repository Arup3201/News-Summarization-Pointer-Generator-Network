A lock-keeper has been spared jail despite killing a fireman when he crashed into the back of his bicycle while eating a sandwich.

Paul Brown, 30, failed to see Joseph Wilkins, 39, as he drove along the country road between Appleton and Eaton, Oxfordshire.

Mr Wilkins was thrown from his bike and landed on a grass verge while on a ride with friend Philip Forbes at 9.10pm on May 24 last year.

Brown broke down in tears as Mr Recorder Andrew Burrows QC said that Mr Wilkins had two children who had been left fatherless.

He said: 'He was killed instantly when the Ford
 Focus driven by you from the direction of Appleton hit him from behind 
on a straight section of Eaton Road.

'He leaves behind Nicci Saunders, his partner of seven years, and the rest of the family and close friends.

'She has known him since she was five years old and they have two daughters aged two and five years.

'Nicci
 Saunders attended each day of the trial for causing death by dangerous 
driving and I would like to take this opportunity to extent the sympathy
 of the court to her and the family for the loss.'

Brown was cleared by a jury of causing death by dangerous driving but admitted the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving.

During the trial the court heard that Brown, who looks after several locks along the River Thames in Oxfordshire, had been eating a sandwich shortly before the crash.

However, Mr Recorder Burrows told the court that although he had been holding the sandwich, Brown had his eyes on the road ahead of him and had not been distracted by a mobile telephone or radio as he drove between 55 and 60mph.

'We're dealing with facts significantly below dangerous driving,' said Mr Recorder Burrows. You simply failed to see Joseph Wilkins. One might describe it as momentary inattention.

'I
 have in the absolute forefront of my mind that cyclists are vulnerable 
in the road and motorists should take care to avoid them.'

The court was also told that Brown had no previous driving convictions and had not been involved in any other crashes in the 12 years he had been driving.

He did have two previous convictions for possession of cannabis for which he was sentenced at magistrates' court, the court was told.

Reading a letter written by Brown, Mr Recorder Burrows said: 'Since the trial verdict of not guilty for death by dangerous driving a lot of people have said "You must be thrilled" but that is not the case.

'Yes I feel relieved that a weight has been lifted from my shoulders but there are no winners in the situation.'

The court heard how Brown had suffered from sleepless nights since the crash and regretted that he had left two children without a father.

'I know there is nothing I can do and this feeling of sorry will live with me forever,' he wrote in his letter.

Brown, of Eynsham, Oxfordshire, was ordered to carry out a community order with an unpaid work requirement of 240 hours within the next 12 months, as well as four sessions of restorative justice.

He was also given a supervision order and banned from driving for 12 months, with his licence endorsed.
