The Sydney Siege survivors have revealed they remain angry about how police and negotiators handled the hostage crisis, as 18 victims were held against their will in the Lindt Café at Martin Place.

The former hostages have opened up about their frustration that police allegedly did not attempt to enter the café or negotiate with their captor, Man Monis, at any point throughout the 17 hour ordeal.

Innocent victims Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson were both killed at the end of the siege on December 16.

Mr Johnson was shot dead by Monis, which prompted police to storm the cafe. Ms Dawson was killed by shrapnel from police bullets during the stand-off. 

Hostage Marcia Mikhael has criticised the police for playing 'a waiting game', accusing the task-force of waiting too long to act and leaving the victims in a life-threatening situation for hours.

'There was nothing proactive about that operation, nothing,' Mikhael told Seven News during a special program which aired on Sunday night.

Marcia Mikhael has criticised the police operation for only being 'reactive, not proactive', as she believes the SWAT team chose to only act if Monis fired his gun

Mikhael has spoken openly about the dark thoughts she had as she remained trapped inside the café, as Monis frequently threatened the hostages with a gun.

'I was dreading the end because I knew the only way they could end it, it was for them kill him,' Mikhael said.

'And I was like, 'How are they going do that without hurting anyone else in here?'

'And it was a waiting game. They were waiting for him to kill someone or shoot something so they can come in.

'They were being reactive.'

Ms Mikhael also suggested that it would have been more suitable for the army to have been called in in response to the siege.

'I know there were a lot of officers there who risked their lives and I thank them from the bottom of my heart. 

'I'm not being ungrateful to them. I just feel like the army would have been better, more appropriate, to handle the situation.'

She also claims that a phone call with a police contact made her lose all hope of survival and feel completely abandoned inside the cafe.

Mikhael felt extreme frustration by the response from police when she called them as Monis' spokesperson, pleading that they meet the self-made sheik's requests.

Monis demanded to speak with the Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, in exchange for the freedom of five hostages.

Ms Mikhael said that a police negotiator told her that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was 'a very busy man', making her feel as if nobody cared about their predicament.

'I actually lost it when someone, told me that the Prime Minister is a very busy man and he can't come to the phone,' Mikhael told Seven News.

'I yelled at him. I just yelled at him and I just...I couldn't believe it.'

Mikhael says felt the hostage crisis was not being prioritised and could not believe there could be a situation more urgent than the siege at Martin Place.

'I was in disbelief. I think I actually said that I don't care what he's doing right now, whether he's walking his dog or playing golf with his mates.

'There is nothing more important right now than this and the lives of the people in this cafe.

'And then I hung up.'

Ms Mikhael claimed that the comment from police led her to believe she and the other victims had been 'left there' and that 'nobody was going to come'.

'It was then that I knew that there was not going to be any negotiation and we were just left there.'

'No-one was coming for us. I knew that.They weren't going to come. So, that's when I lost hope.'  

Many Social Media users expressed their disappointment and anger after Ms Mikhael criticised the police force so heavily. 

'Mikhael is a Westpac manager, not a member of the special forces. Leave them to do their job,' said Marcus Higgins, who said he was 'angered' by Ms Mikhael's comments.

'Marcia Mikhael just demonstrated she clearly still doesn't understand how authorities manage hostage situations #lindtcafe,' tweeted Shaan Sewak.

'I don't know exactly how qualified Marcia Mikhael is to be saying the army would've done a better job,' added Nohemy Vivas.

Ms Mikhael also claims that she told Police Rescue officers to remove Katrina Dawson first, as she lay beside her unmoving. 

However, Ms Mikhael alleges that she was removed from the cafe before Ms Dawson, despite her protestations.

The 43-year-old Westpac executive and mother-of-three also accuses police of 'treating her like a criminal' after she gave a police statement following the traumatic experience. 

She claims police will not allow her to access a copy of the statement she gave to police.  

'I'm very angry. Why is it that I have two legs that kind of don't work right now? Why is it that there are two dead people besides the bad guy? 

'I feel like I'm being treated as a criminal myself. Can't get my police statement. Why am I the criminal here?'  

The first hostage to escape, John O'Brien, 82, also says he is angry that the attack was not prevented, despite warning signs. 

'Oh, I am very angry. Two or three months ago (before the siege), I said, 'Look, it won't be long before we have an attack here',' Mr O'Brien claimed in the Seven News Special Report.
