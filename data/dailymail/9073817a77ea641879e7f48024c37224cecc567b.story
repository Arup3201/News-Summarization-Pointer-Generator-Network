A senior executive at Rolls-Royce was given a pay-off of nearly £1million - just a day after the company announced 2,600 job cuts.

Chief financial officer and executive director, Mark Morris, will step down from the post with around £900,000 in lieu of his 12-month notice period.

The announcement came hours before the engineering group stated that it would be cutting thousands of jobs - mainly in the aerospace division - in the next 18 months.

Mark Morris, chief financial officer and executive director, has stepped down from his post with a £1m pay-off

It currently employees around 25,000 employees, mostly in Derby, Bristol, and other UK cities, with around two third of jobs cuts expect to fall in the UK. 

Mr Morris's pay-off will include his £510,000 basic salary plus £207,150 for benefits such as his pension, motoring allowance and medical insurance.

He will also receive the 18,591 ordinary shares he is due as a performance related incentive - worth £157,838 at today's valuation of 849p per share.

And he will be entitled to £40,000 worth of 'career transition support'.  

A spokesman for the company said the executive had received his contractual severance based on his notice period.

He said: 'His notice period is longer than for other employees, but a year is standard amongst directors of FTSE 100 boards.

'As to his salary, Rolls-Royce needs to pay the going rate in order to attract and retain directors but our remuneration policy is relatively conservative.'

Rolls-Royce announced it would be cutting 2,600 jobs just a day before Mark Morris said he would quit his job

Mr Morris had worked at the company for 27 years, serving as chief financial officer since January 2012.

The company has appointed David Smith, the chief financial officer of the company’s aerospace arm. 

He will reportedly be offered a similar pay and benefits package as his predecessor. 

Meanwhile the company hopes the job cuts will save it £80m and says it remains hopeful that civil aerospace markets will strengthen over the medium term.

This is due to increasing demand for travel in emerging economies and the need to replace older aircraft with new fuel efficient models. 

Chief executive John Rishton said: 'We will work closely with employees and their representatives to achieve the necessary reductions on a voluntary basis where possible while making sure we retain the skills needed for the future.'

However, the Unite union has warned the company of future skill shortages and called for guarantees over compulsory redundancies. 

Unite national officer, Ian Waddell, said: 'Rolls-Royce is danger of making decisions in the short-term that it will later regret.

'Engineering skills and expertise are already in short supply across the aerospace industry and will be difficult to replace should there be an up-turn in business.

'We will be seeking guarantees over no compulsory redundancies and seeking assurances that the company doesn’t turn to casual labour to plug the skills cap in the future, or seek to offshore skilled UK jobs.

'This is a bitter blow to a proud workforce and we will be doing everything we can to fight for jobs and skills.'

The group, which has major bases in Bristol and Derby, said the cull will was part of a major restructuring at the firm, and will mainly impact its aerospace division
