His disappearance almost forty years ago remains one of Britain's great mysteries, and now it is being made into a hotly anticipated ITV drama.

Lord Lucan's new incarnation on the small screen is Rory Kinnear, and the Skyfall actor was pictured looking remarkably like the aristocrat while shooting scenes in London.

The 35-year-old Othello star actor was seen portraying the missing Lucan yesterday.

In Character: Rory Kinnear will star in an ITV drama of Lord Lucan's - the aristocrat vanished in 1974 following the murder of nanny, Sandra Rivett

The star had a moustache for the role and his hair slicked back.

He wore a navy blue dinner jacket over a maroon jumper and shirt and tie with grey trousers and brogue type shoes.

There are children in the scenes too, presumably playing Lord Lucan's three children who were left abandoned when their father infamously disappeared.

Lucan vanished following the murder of his children's nanny on November 7, 1974.

Mystery: what happened to the aristocrat remains unclear

After the attack, he went to the home of friends, telling them he had found the nanny had been murdered.

Three
days later, his car was found abandoned in Newhaven, East Sussex, with 
bloodstains on the front seat and a length of lead piping matching the 
one found in the Belgravia basement.

There was speculation he had committed suicide, but no body was found.

An inquest jury declared the wealthy aristocrat the killer a year later.

Controversial: The real aristocrat's son had expressed concerns about how the production would present his father's dissappearance

East-End gangster Dennis Stafford insists he met the elusive
aristocrat in Africa whilst on the run from authorities.

Mystery: Lord Lucan with his son, George Bingham, now the 8th Lord Lucan, who claims he has not seen his father since his disappearance in November 1974

The former friend of the Kray twins 
says he came across Lord Lucan in the Monapatapa Hotel, in Harare, 
Zimbabwe, he believes, sometime between 1982 and 1983.

Engineers
Lawrie Prebble and Ian Meyrick also came forward to say they are 
'completely convinced' the man they saw drinking in a hotel bar in 
Botswana with six friends is the legendary Lucan.

What happened to Lucan remains a mystery and he was officially declared dead by the High Court in 1999 but there have been reported sightings of him as far afield as Australia, Ireland and South Africa.

The two-part ITV drama is based on John Pearson's book The Gamblers, which claims Lucan's high-rolling friends who gathered at the Clermont Club in Mayfair, central London, and included Sir James Goldsmith and John Aspinall, spirited him out of the country after the murder.

Former Doctor Who star Christopher Eccleston will play Aspinall and the cast also includes Michael Gambon.

The aristocrat's son George Bingham met the makers of the drama this week to be reassured that the production would not be a 'fantasy drama'.

A source told the Daily Mirror this week:'George was worried about how his father – this notorious figure and ­assumed murderer – would be portrayed.'

'He is a big fan of Rory Kinnear and thinks he is a brilliant actor but ­wanted to know which version of events the ­programme would follow.'

'Fortunately it seems the version they have chosen very much fits with what he thinks happened – that his father abandoned the family and killed himself at sea.'
