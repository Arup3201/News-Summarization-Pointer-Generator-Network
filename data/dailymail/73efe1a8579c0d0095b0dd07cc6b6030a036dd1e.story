Furious fish shop owners have slammed a council after it spent £3,000 of taxpayers' cash on a guide on how to make their chips.

The six-page document goes into minute detail on how thick each chip should be, as well as recommending exact temperatures for frying and informing workers that fries should be 'golden' in colour.

Chippie owners criticised Cheltenham Borough Council bureaucrats for the guide, calling it patronising and unnecessary.

A council spent £3,000 on the guides on how to cook chips, which advises chippie owners to cut chips to at least 14mm, slightly more than half an inch, in width

Chip shop owners are advised that chips should be served when they are a 'pale, golden colour'

The detailed document, written by the Food Standards Agency, explains to workers how they can 'make the food they serve healthier' while saving money.

The initiative, launched by Cheltenham's local authority, then explains that the best chips are made  'using a cutter with at least a 14mm (just more than half an inch) cross section'.

Chip shop workers are then told to heat their fryer to 175C before putting potatoes in, cooking them for 5-6 minutes until they are a 'pale, golden colour'.

Despite the lengthy description on how long a chip should be cooked for - 5-6 minutes - the guide says it is sometimes better just to follow instructions on the packet.

The guidance reads: 'Frozen chips may only take 2-3 minutes – businesses should follow the manufacturer’s instructions.'

They should also make sure they wash their fryers and change their oil often.

The council document also suggests using rapeseed or sunflower oils, which are 'high oleic' - or high in unsaturated fats.

The guide also recommends using salt shakers with fewer holes in and asking customers whether they want salt on their fries.

Andreo Michael, who owns Norwood Fish Bar in Cheltenham, said: 'If you've been in the business like me since 1980 you don't need to be told how to do chips.

'Some people might need telling, but I don't need them telling me what to do.'

Chips should be fried on their own to ensure oil quality is not affected, according to the document

The document also advises on the correct oils to be used to fry chips, suggesting 'high oleic' oils

The six-page document, branded as patronising by chip shop workers, suggests using salt shakers with fewer holes and asking customers whether they want salt

James Ritchie, 28, who owns Simpsons Fish and Chips in the Gloucestershire town, said: 'We try really hard to make sure we know these things anyway.

'We have our food nutritionally tested so for us this would not be a good experience for us.

'I would go to the National Federation of Fish Friers for advice and not the council. They couldn't tell us anything. There is nothing they could tell us that we don't already know.'

Gloucestershire County Council has allocated £40,000 to Cheltenham Borough Council to fund health improvement schemes in 2013/14 and 2014/15.

The guide says: 'By shaking the chips and banging the wire scoop several times, you can reduce fat absorption by 20% and make your chips crisper. 

'This is because chips carry on absorbing fat after they come out of the fryer.

'If you bang and shake you’ll use less oil, need to top up less often, and need to empty the drain in the chip box less often.'

Just over £20,000 has been awarded to five projects in the town this year - including the so-called 'healthy chip' scheme, which costs £3,000.

It is hoped that the scheme will help reduce the amount of oil absorbed into deep fried foods, consequently reducing obesity levels in low-income areas.

A spokesman for the TaxPayers' Alliance branded the guide a 'ludicrous' move.

He said: 'When we're trying to make savings it beggars belief the council is doing takeaway training.

'The idea that it's appropriate to spend taxpayers' money telling chip shop owners how to cut chips is just ludicrous.

'They must think again - even the beneficiaries of this bizarre scheme don't seem particularly keen on it.

'If the Council wants people in low-income areas to be able to buy healthier, but often more expensive, food it should think about cutting council tax.'

Jamie Ritchie, owner of Simpsons Fish and Chips in Cheltenham, said the council could not tell him anything he did not already know

But Councillor Rowena Hay, cabinet member for healthy lifestyles on Cheltenham Borough Council, defended the policy.

She said: 'The project is about encouraging and supporting takeaways in low-income communities to serve healthier food.

'Its aim is to encourage small takeaway businesses to implement simple procedural changes to the way they fry food so as to produce a healthier product.

'We want to actively encourage healthier eating in any community in order to reduce obesity and long term illness and this project will help in doing this.' 

According to the guidance, shops should use liquid oils, such as sunflower and rapeseed, heated to 175C before each batch, for 'crispier, more appealing chips'.

The document's advice on cutting down on salt reads:

'Lots of people are trying to cut down on the amount of salt they eat. You can help your customers to do this by doing these things.

• 'Use a salt shaker with fewer holes – just ask your supplier if they provide five-hole tops.

• 'Ask your customers if they want salt before adding it.

• 'Don’t add salt to batter mix. If you buy batter mix, check the ingredients and try to choose one that doesn’t contain salt or sodium.

• 'Read the label on foods like sauces, sausages and pies and choose the one with less salt (or it might say ‘sodium’). If there’s no information on salt, ask your supplier.'

The advice on cooking healthy chips was also condensed into a two-page document, pictured here

Researchers claim the oil is essential when it comes to frying and it should be sieved and reheated at the end of every batch.

The guide adds that 'the ratio of food to oil should be 1:6' and 'baskets shouldn't look more than half full'.

Research suggests that most retailers complete a full oil change every 2-4 weeks, but this should actually be done after 20 frying hours, it explains. 

Chips must be cooked in a fryer without any other food contact and the chef should shake them and bang them with a wire scoop several times after cooking.

Research suggests this simple movement can reduce fat absorption by 20 per cent, making the chips crisper. 

They are also advised to offer smaller portion sizes, 'for people with smaller appetites'.
