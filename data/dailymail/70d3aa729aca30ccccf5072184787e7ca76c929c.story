A woman was left with huge white patches all over her body after developing skin condition vitiligo as a child.

Lisa Johnson, 24, who is from Los Angeles, was targeted by bullies who made her life a misery. 

But a new treatment and a state of the art makeover could be about to change that.

Lisa Johnson developed vitiligo when she was a child and bullies have made her life a misery ever since

Lisa suffered horrendous bullying for over 17 years before seeking professional help with the condition 

Lisa, here after her face treated with the specialist coverup, says it has boosted her confidence and allowed her to be herself again

She said: 'It's a condition which causes my skin to turn a different colour.

'I now have white patches covering more than a third of my body.'

The condition is not life-threatening but its psychological effects can be devastating to sufferers.

'When I was in high school the kids were very mean to me,' added the 24-year-old.

'The abuse, the name-calling and the fighting were all very difficult to deal with.

'I would just go home and cry - I would always run home straight to my sister, she has always had my back and fought my battles for me.

'I'm just so glad I had somebody there who would stick up for me and help me through the difficult times.

Lisa, seen prior to a light therapy treatment, says she often receives stares and jibes in public 

'The years of bullying have led me to always expect the worst when I'm out in public. It's really difficult.'

When she is walking around her home city of Los Angeles in America, Lisa often attracts stares from passersby.

Her friend Robert Allen said: 'The stares are difficult to deal with. 

Until the light therapy has had a chance to take effect, Lisa is having make-up applied to cover her white patches

The computer analysis means that the make up is an exact match to Lisa's skin, creating the illusion of normal skin and totally transforming Lisa's day-to-day life

'Instead of just saying: 'Hello, how are you?' people just stare at her.

'Amazingly she does not let it get to her or if she does, she does not show it.'

Vitiligo is a long-term condition that causes pale, white patches to develop on the skin due to lack of a chemical called melanin.

Melanin is produced by specialised skin cells called melanocytes, gives your skin its colour and protects it from the sun.

It is not exactly clear what causes this lack of melanin, but it has been linked to problems with the immune system (autoimmune conditions) and nerve endings in the skin.

Certain things can increase your chances of developing vitiligo, such as a family history of the condition or having another autoimmune problem, like hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland).

Vitiligo can affect any area of your skin, but most commonly occurs on skin exposed to the sun, such as your face, neck and hands.

The condition varies from person to person. Some people only get a few small, white patches that progress no further. Other people get bigger white patches that join up across large areas of their skin.

There is no way of predicting how much of your skin will be affected. The white patches are usually permanent.

Lisa had a normal, happy childhood until she noticed a white mark on her body - but she had no idea what was to come or how fast it would spread.

She added: 'I noticed it when I was around seven years old, then it developed on to my leg and it just kept spreading.'

After 17 years of suffering she has turned to a skin specialist to for help.

Dr Pearl Grimes said: 'This condition dramatically affects quality of life.

'It can interfere with a person's physical and mental well-being with devastating effects.

'But there is hope available for Lisa, I'm recommending a course of Narrowband UV light therapy which should re-colour her skin.'

The therapy could take some time to take effect, so in the short term Lisa has been given a specialist cover-up product.

A computer generates a special formula after analysing images of Lisa's skin and it tells a dermatologist how much of each colour to use to cover over the white patches.

After the procedure, Lisa said: 'It just feels absolutely fantastic - to see the smile on my sister's face when she saw me really warms my heart and my soul.

'I feel like I can be me again.'

Lisa's story appears in a new series of Body Bizarre, which airs every Thursday at 9pm on TLC 

 

Throughout his career Michael Jackson's skin tone became increasingly lighter (l-r) 1975, 1983 and 2007

Pop legend Michael Jackson is undoubtedly one of the most famous sufferers of the skin condition ever.

The Thriller singer announced that the cause of his dramatically lightening skin was vitiligo in a 1993 interview on Oprah Winfrey's self titled chat show. 

At the time there were various rumours being put forward as to the reason behind the singer seemingly changing ethnicity.

African American Jackson had already had surgery to slim down his nose when his skin tone began to become drastically whiter from around the mid 1980s- leading some to speculate the singer was using skin bleaching as part of a effort to 'Westernise' his appearance.

However, upon Jackson's death from cardiac arrest on June 25 2009, the autopsy revealed that Jackson, who was 50 at the time of his death, was indeed suffering with vitiligo.

Dr Rogers confirmed from his autopsy that Jackson's skin became lighter in the 1980s owing to 'vitiligo, a skin pigmentation disease.'

He added: 'So some areas of the skin appear light and others appear dark.'
