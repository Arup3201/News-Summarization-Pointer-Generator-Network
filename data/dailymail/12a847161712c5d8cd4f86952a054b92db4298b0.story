Katherine Poxon, 22, pictured outside Leeds Crown Court, has been jailed for conspiring to unlawfully cause GBH to her husband Steven Poxon

A cheating wife who plotted with her lover to stab her husband to death so they could be together has been jailed for more than two years – but has remarkably been forgiven by her understanding husband.

Katherine Poxon, 22, and her lover Stephen Swallow, 44, have both been jailed for the plot to attack Steven Poxon, which a judge said lacked ‘guile and sophistication’.

Leeds Crown Court heard how the young mother nagged Swallow via text to ‘get the job done’, after her husband found out about their affair and threatened to take custody of their son.

However, Mr Poxon has now forgiven his scheming wife - he attended court for the sentencing hearing and plans to reconcile with her when she is released from prison.

Mrs Poxon of Pontefract, West Yorkshire, was described by defence lawyer Richard Clews as an ‘immature and silly girl, rather than a calculating and cold criminal’ as the court was told about her plan to brutally attack her spouse.

The court heard how the Poxons' marriage had become unhappy prior to their split in December 2012.

However, the pair reunited in spring last year, just before Mrs Poxon began an affair with 44-year-old Swallow.

Swallow, of Featherstone, West Yorkshire, said he had known Katherine Poxon - who appeared in the dock wearing black shiny leggings, a checked shirt and bright pink trainers - for a few years before they began their affair.

The two were arrested last September and had their phones seized by police officers, after Swallow admitted to his niece that he planned to kill Mr Poxon.

Gurdial Singh, prosecuting, told the court Katherine Poxon sent her lover a series of texts before saying: ‘I hope you kill Stu [Steven] babe, then we can be happy.

‘You know if you come out tomorrow 
will you and your mate do that thing for me? I would love for it to be 
done so we can be together.’

She then sent him a text asking him to ‘get the job done’.

Swallow
 was later seen by a neighbour standing drinking outside the Poxon 
family home in September last year, claiming he was ‘off to stab Poxon’ 
and pulling two knives out of his pocket.

In
 a statement to police, the neighbour said: ‘I was aware of the affair 
that was going on. I was at home when I saw Swallow outside his house 
mouthing off and drinking from a can of lager.

‘He said, “I’m off to go and stab him”, then he took two knives out of his pocket.

‘I calmed him down and told him to go back inside. He later thanked me for calming him down.’

Defending
 Swallow, Robin Frieze told the judge his client was a ‘vulnerable’ 
person with previous convictions for theft and moderate violence, 
fuelled by problems with drink and depression.

Mr Frieze said: ‘Poxon knew about his psychiatric problems and he thought she would support him, instead she said she wanted her husband dead so he said he would help her.

‘He said he wouldn’t have gone through with it although there were several occasions he left the house with a knife.’

Mr Frieze told the judge his client had later described Poxon as being ‘twisted’, that her marriage was ‘unhappy’ and that she was ‘angry’ with her husband for threatening to take away their son and wanted him to get him ‘out of her life’.

In February, Poxon and Swallow pleaded guilty to conspiring together to unlawfully cause GBH.

Telling them they should be ‘thankful’ of the neighbour’s intervention, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC sentenced Swallow to three years in prison, while Poxon was jailed for 27 months.

Turning to Poxon, the judge said: ‘This was not a sophisticated conspiracy, and I am aware your husband has forgiven you.

‘You are still very young and have no previous convictions.’

He added: ‘You lack guile and sophistication and Mr Swallow you are fortunate you have a supportive family who will allow you to stay with them when you are released from prison.’
