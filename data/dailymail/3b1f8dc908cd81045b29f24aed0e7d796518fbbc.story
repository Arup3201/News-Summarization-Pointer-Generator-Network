Say cheese: amused police officers snap a selfie with the circus escapees.

Three camels who escaped from a circus in Melbourne have been captured by amused police, who took the opportunity to snap a selfie with the escape artists.

The animals hoofed it under the cloak of darkness early Thursday, before they were spotted at a McDonald's drive-through in Melbourne's south-east around 3am.

A patron at the fast food restaurant who had stopped for breakfast with friends, told the Herald Sun he was surprised by the discovery. 

'You never usually see camels there - it was a funny discovery'.

An hour later, Narre Warren police responded to reports of an unusual traffic hazard on the Princes Highway, where they found the trio munching on trees on the side of the road.

The officers got snap happy with the runaways as they waited for circus staff to return the animals to the big top.

The camels had escaped from the Circus Royale just 300m from where they were found.

Police said the camels had caused little trouble during their brief break-out.

We’ve had cows and sheep and everything like that, but we’ve never had camels,' Constable Steven Pope told 3AW.

'It was definitely a first.'
