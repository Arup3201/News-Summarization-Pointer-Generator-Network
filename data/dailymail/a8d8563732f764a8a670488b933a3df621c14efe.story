Wreckage found on an Alaskan glacier is the remains of a missing Air Force plane that crashed in  the 1950s, killing all 52 people on board.

Authorities revealed today the site has been identified after it was discovered on Knik Glacier near Anchorage earlier this month.

It means the victims' families may finally get answers as to why their loved ones died nearly 60 years on from the tragedy.

Specialised team: Team members from the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command and Northern Warefare Training Center, searches for aircraft wreckage on Knik Glacier near Anchorage, Alaska

Joint POW-MIA Accounting Command spokesperson Captain Jamie Dobson said the wreckage is of a Douglas C-124A Globemaster II.

The Korean War-era Air Force cargo plane crashed on November 22, 1952, NBC station KTUU of Anchorage reported.

It was found on June 10 on Colony 
Glacier, around 45 miles east of Anchorage, by a UH-60 Blackhawk crew 
with the Alaska Army National Guard.

While evidence collected by the 
eight-man team is en route to JPAC’s Central Identification Laboratory 
in Hawaii for further analysis, Cpt Dobson said the plane was 
identifiable by materials found at the scene.

Identified: Captain Jamie Dobson said the wreckage spotted was that of a Douglas C-124A Globemaster II. The Korean War-era Air Force cargo plane went missing on November 22

'Some of the evidence has already been positively correlated with this crash,' Cpt Dobson told KTUU.

Harsh weather prevented a recovery at the time and later the authorities could not locate it.

The Globemaster II entered Air Force service in 1950 as the world’s largest transport plane.

Its forward loading ramp and aft 
cargo elevator, as well as its ability to carry 68,500 pounds of cargo 
or 200 passengers on two decks of seating, made it the Air Force's 
primary heavy-lift transport into the early 1960s.

Workhorse: The Douglas C-124C Globemaster II was the largest transport aircraft when it was introduced into service in 1950

In action: Seen here in the Korean War the aircraft's unique front-loading system allowed for 68,000lbs of cargo or 200 passengers seated on two decks

The four-propeller transport was 
eventually replaced by the C-141 Starlifter jet, but its name lives on 
in Alaska skies with the C-17 Globemaster III, operated by the 517th 
Airlift Squadron at Anchorage’s Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

Crash researcher Tonja Anderson, 
whose grandfather Airman Isaac Anderson died in the crash, told KTUU  the
cargo plane was on a flight from McChord Air Force Base in Washington 
to Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage when it crashed near the 
8,000ft level of Mount Gannett.
