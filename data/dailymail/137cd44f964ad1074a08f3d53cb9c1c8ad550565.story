A 99-year-old great-grandmother has become the oldest person in Europe to have a hearing implant.

Mollie Smith believes she lost her hearing after being exposed to German Zeppelins dropping bombs during the First World War.

She says her hearing was badly damaged as a result of the bombing raids and she finally went deaf in both ears 29 years ago, when she was 70.

Mollie Smith, 99, has become the oldest person in Europe to be fitted with a cochlear implant

Mrs Smith (pictured in her youth) began to lose her hearing when she was in her 70s before also losing her sight. As a result, she lost her independence and so jumped at the chance to have the implant

But she can now hear after having a cochlear implant – and will be able to hear her family sing Happy Birthday when she turns 100 in September.

In January, Mrs Smith underwent the operation, which involves having the implant surgically placed under the skin of the head, and now tests have proved it was a success.

It means Mrs Smith, who was born in 1914, is the oldest person in Europe to ever undergo the operation.

A cochlear implant is a small electronic device that can help provide a sense of sound to a person who is deaf or severely hard of hearing.

The implants cannot restore normal hearing but they can give a deaf person a good representation of sounds, meaning they can learn to understand speech again.

Mrs Smith underwent the procedure at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after her daughter Rita, 77, contacted them last June.

The cochlear implant was fitted in January and switched on last month so Mrs Smith will be able to hear in time for her 100th birthday in September

Today Mrs Smith, of Rugby, Warwickshire, told of her joy at being able to hear her grandchildren and great-grandson for the very first time.

She said: ‘I have six grandchildren and one great-grandchild and to hear them chatter to me is wonderful.

‘They will all be here for my birthday in September and I can't wait to hear them sing to me, it really will be something special and something I never expected to happen.

‘This implant has really changed my life, I can now communicate with people without having to shout and let everyone else know my business.’

A cochlear implant is a surgically implanted electronic device that gives a person who is profoundly deaf a sense of sound.

It will not cure deafness, but is a prosthetic substitute for hearing.

The device is surgically implanted under a general anaesthetic and the procedure takes up to five hours.

It involves making an incision in the skin and attaching the device through the bone behind the ear and into the inner ear.

The devices receives sound, processes it, and sends small electric currents near the auditory nerve.

The currents activate the nerve, which sends a signal to the brain, which the person comes to learn as hearing.

Mrs Smith was born in Brigg, North Lincolnshire, in 1914 and believes she suffered irreparable hearing damage after being exposed to the droning sound of Zeppelins flying overhead.

She believes this early damage contributed to her losing her hearing completely in later life.

Mrs Smith, who is widowed, said: ‘I was born in Brigg and the Zeppelins came over a lot when I was a baby. My mother said this is why my hearing was damaged.

‘It feels great to be the oldest person in Europe to have this done and I really didn't think I would be eligible but the Queen Elizabeth Hospital were great and have given me a new lease of life.

‘I feel like I will carry on like this for another 50 years, that's how I feel at the moment, it is just lovely what has happened to me.

‘The implant is so clever, it is quite amazing, it adjusts to its surroundings so it will never be too loud or too quiet, it is always just right.

‘I had tinnitus and all I thought I could hear was breeze blowing through trees and that was the last thing I could hear before I went deaf.

‘I spent over £10,000 on hearing aids in the past that just haven't worked and now it is brilliant to finally hear again, I really have missed it.’

Mrs Smith worked as a motorbike dispatch rider during the Second World War and worked as a dog trainer until she became deaf in 1985.

Her daughter, Rita, who is her full time carer, said: ‘Mum has always been active, she goes to the gym with me and loves the treadmill and rowing machine.

‘This operation has changed her life as well as mine, it used to be a nightmare having to communicate with her when we were out, everyone would hear us shouting.

Mrs Smith (pictured when she was young) hopes the implant will enable her to regain her independence

Mrs Smith (right, with a friend) will not regain her normal hearing as a result of the implant but it will send signals to her auditory nerve which can then be interpreted by the brain

‘She did learn to lip read but it still wasn't good enough to hold a full conversation and she couldn't hear herself properly so would shout a lot.

‘Even when we were together I would have to write everything down so it was very time consuming, although now, it is perfect, everything is so much easier for everyone.

‘She is really looking forward to her birthday in September, we will have family and friends round and put up a gazebo in the garden, she can't wait to hear people, especially the grandkids, sing her Happy Birthday for the first time.’

Andrew Reid, consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon who carried out the implant on Mrs Smith, said: ‘The intent was to improve her hearing and allow her to maintain a level of independent living.

‘This sort of thing is possible for older people because of modern-day skills of anaesthesia and nursing care.’

The oldest person in the world to have a cochlear implant is Jack Walley who is 102.

Mollie Smith's hearing was damaged by the noise of Zeppelins in the War

@highlight

As a result, she lost her hearing gradually when she was in her 70s

@highlight

She is also losing her sight, so she lost a lot of her independence

@highlight

In January she had a cochlear implant fitted - it was turned on last month

@highlight

Means she will be able to hear in time for her 100th birthday in September

The device does not cure deafness but activates the auditory nerve

@highlight

This sends signals to the brain which the patient learns to interpret
