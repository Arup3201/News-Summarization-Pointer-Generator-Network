Muslim separatists from far-west China have been blamed for the brutal murder of 29 people in a frenzied knife attacked that left 143 others critically wounded.

The killers launched the horrific slaughter at Kunming railway station in Yunnan province at around 9pm local time on Saturday.

It is believed that more than 10 people 
took part in the attack. Four were shot by armed police, 
one was taken alive, and the rest are still being hunted.

Today armed police patrolled the streets as members of the Uighur community were questioned

Panic: Police are urgently questioning all Uighur Muslims in Kunming after the attack that left 143 injured

CCTV shows there to have been 10 masked attackers randomly knifing bystanders in Kunming station

Their identities have not been confirmed, but evidence at the 
scene showed that it was carried out by Uighir Muslims, native to far-west Xinjiang, 900 miles away, local media claim.

Since President Xi Jinping was elected in 2009, Xinjiang has been simmering rebellion against Chinese rule by some members of
 the Uighur population.

In a desperate bid to make sense of the attack, police rounded up every member of Kunming's small Uighur community - a few dozen people - for questioning.

'How do we know them?' said a Uighur man who gave only his first name, 
Akpar. 'We could not tell if the assailants were Uighurs as they were 
all dressed in black. We did not like the attack either.'

Most 
attacks blamed on Uighur separatists take place in Xinjiang, where 
clashes between Uighurs and police or the Han 
majority are frequent.

But Saturday's assault happened more than 900 miles to the southeast in Yunnan, which has no recent history of unrest.

Residents, mainly of the Han ethnic majority, have called for the Uighur minority to be driven out of Yunnan

Lighting candles for the 29 dead, Kunming residents said they were scared to go out at night

If correct, it would be the deadliest violence 
attributed to Uighur-Han conflicts since the 2009 riots in Xinjiang 
capital Urumqi, when Uighurs stormed the streets randomly slaying women 
and children. Han mobs responded, and nearly 200 people died.

One Kunming resident, Jiang Hua, said the attack has made people scared to go out at night and Uighurs should be banished.

'I
 think we should chase off the Uighurs and let them be independent,' 
Jiang said. 'And local authorities should be held accountable for 
providing public safety.'

However, one man paying tribute, restaurant worker Xie Yulong, expressed sympathy 
toward ethnic Uighurs.

He said 
the attackers were 'worse than animals', but added that the Uighur region has come under severe 
security crackdowns in recent months under the government of President 
Xi Jinping.

'It's the 
pressure,' Xie said. 'Beijing has put too much pressure on them since Xi
 Jinping took over. They are under so much pressure they do not want to 
live, and they did that.'

Police chief and head of the government's central commission for political affairs Meng Jianzhu visited the wounded on Sunday and was given an update by Kunming officers on their investigation

Crackdown: He said the terrorists will be 'severely punished' to prevent similar cases in the future

Distressing photos circulating online showed bodies, pools of blood and abandoned luggage scattered across the terminal floor in the wake of what authorities termed an 'organised, premeditated, violent terrorist attack'.

According to CCTV, the Chinese state broadcaster, at least two of the attackers were female.

One was killed by police and the other was the woman who was captured. She has been taken to hospital for treatment.

'All-out efforts should be made to treat the injured people, 
severely punish terrorists according to the law, and prevent the 
occurrence of similar cases,' said China's chief police official, Meng Jianzhu, who unusually travelled on a Sunday to visit the scene - an 
indication of how seriously authorities viewed the attack.

Yesterday, residents flooded the province's hospitals to donate blood for the wounded.Â 

Others took to the streets with candles, calling on the authorities to clamp down on the Uighur community.
