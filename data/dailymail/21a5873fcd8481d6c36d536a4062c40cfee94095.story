They blew kisses to the crowd and thumped the air with joy after being crowned Olympic silver medallists.

But within minutes, Britain’s male gymnasts were told there had been a mistake with the score. They had, in fact, won bronze.

The gymnastics team were told they had been downgraded after the Japanese successfully appealed against their  own marks.

Japan leaped from fourth to second and China convincingly took the gold.

Viewers are demanding more medal ceremonies on the BBC’s main Olympics coverage – even when a British competitor is not involved.

Fans have been frustrated by the broadcaster’s decision to ignore various presentations in favour of studio chat or cutting to other coverage.

Critics say it is as much a part of the Games to see the medal ceremonies as the contests themselves.

While the BBC showed swimmer Rebecca Adlington’s medal presentation on Sunday night, other ceremonies from that night’s action were not shown.

Viewers expressed their frustration on the corporation’s message-boards. One said: ‘The BBC don’t seem to understand the pride and emotion that is enjoyed when watching the medal ceremonies? 

Another said: ‘Why deny BBC viewers smiling faces of the winning athletes at the medal ceremonies?’ 

A BBC spokesman said: ‘All the ceremonies are being shown on the Olympic channels. On BBC One and Three, we take them on editorial merit.’

Yet, in a display of dignity and 
sportsmanship, the five stoical young Britons refused to be disappointed
 and, as they stood on the podium, they kissed their medals and waved to
 their adoring fans.

It was, after all, the first podium medal for a British gymnastics team for 100 years, since the 1912 Stockholm Olympics.

London 2012 poster boy and Beijing 
bronze medallist Louis Smith, 23, and his four teammates had entered the
 North Greenwich Arena with an outside chance of a medal.

But the deafening roars of the home 
crowd cheered Smith, Daniel Purvis, 21, Max Whitlock, 19, Kristian 
Thomas, 23, and Sam Oldham, 19, through to a podium position.

The athletes were watched by Prince 
William and Prince Harry – who sat tensely with their fists in front of 
their mouths during the final minutes – as the team performed 
spectacular routines in all six disciplines.

Smith, the captain of the team and a 
favourite to win a medal later this week on the pommel horse, said: 
‘Despite the protesting getting the scoring changed, this is a dream 
come true for all of us.

‘For these guys, it’s their first Olympics, so to get a medal, a bronze medal, is unbelievable.

‘Silver, bronze, it doesn’t matter. 
Our target was to get fifth in the competition and enjoy the 
competition. We enjoyed it and we got a bronze medal.’

After a spectacular performance on 
the floor exercises in the final round, Britain jumped from fourth to 
second on the scoreboard, causing the 16,000-strong crowd to leap up 
from their seats in jubilation.

Team Japan sit dejected after the initial result places them fourth. After judges spent about five minutes reviewing three-time world champion Kohei Uchimura on the pommel horse, his score was revised and Japan was awarded the silver medal

But after the Japanese believed they had been marked too harshly on the pommel horse, they appealed to judges for a re-mark.

Then came the revelation that there had been an error.

The devastated Ukrainian team, who thought they had won bronze, were relegated to fourth and left empty-handed.

Thomas said: ‘A silver would have been nice but I couldn’t complain at all right now.’

His teammate Purvis added: ‘If 
someone had said to us before the competition we would come away with a 
bronze, we would be buzzing. Getting a bronze is absolutely amazing.’ 
After a great performance, Smith now looks in a strong position to take 
gold in the individual event on the pommel horse.

He has conceived the most difficult 
50-second pommel horse routine in the world which, if performed cleanly,
 should prove unbeatable.

And at the British Championships last
 month, Smith recorded a personal best of 16.375 – one of the highest 
scores ever for pommel.

William shows his dismay after Britain's silver turns to bronze

The natural showman is known for his outlandish 
hairstyles and outspoken views, as well as his ability to work the crowd
 up into a frenzy.

Three years ago, after his success in
 the individual events at the Beijing Olympics, he decided to pursue his
 second dream of singing and entered the X Factor.

But his singing failed to impress 
Cowell and he was not sent through to the next round. He admits he 
looked ‘like a goon’ and will focus on his sport – for now.

It will come as a relief to his many fans, who waved flags and screamed themselves hoarse during yesterday’s tense competition.

Spectator Kerstin Wolgast, 34, from 
the City of London, said: ‘First we expected nothing, then out of 
nothing we had silver, and then bronze – it was an emotional 
rollercoaster.’

Her partner John Mills, 45, a former PE teacher, added: 
‘It was fantastic. The boys did really well. Talk about home advantage.’

Prime Minister David Cameron 
announced the team’s success to a huge cheer and applause as he began 
his speech at a reception at the Royal Academy of Arts in central London
 last night.
