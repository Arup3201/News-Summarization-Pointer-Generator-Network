Adel Taarabt was a non-starter for QPR reserves on Tuesday afternoon.

Hoops boss Harry Redknapp stated in his post-match press conference following Monday night's win over Aston Villa that Taarabt would face Swansea in the Under-21 fixture on Tuesday afternoon at the club's Harlington training ground in west London.

Redknapp said: 'He's (Adel's) working hard this week, he's working with the fitness coaches and we've got a game tomorrow for the reserves (at home to Swansea) and him and one or two of the lads will get a game.'

The Moroccan midfielder has been accused of being three stone overweight by manager Harry Redknapp

Redknapp had claimed Taarabt would get a game in the reserves after being left out of the first team sqaud

But, just 16 hours later, there was no sign of the Moroccan international, slammed by his manager in the 'Fatgate' scandal and accused of being overweight last week, in the 16-man squad for the 2pm kick off.

It is believed Taarabt trained on Tuesday morning with the rest of the QPR squad who did not feature in the 2-0 Premier League victory over Villa at Loftus Road.

After that much-needed success, Redknapp sought an end to his spat with Taarabt, claiming the forward has a future at the club, as long as he gets himself fit.

Redknapp added: 'Absolutely he could still play a part in the future if he gets himself fit.

'All I ask people to do is come in every day, train, be thankful for being a professional footballer, work hard, god gave them a fantastic talent and I just hope he doesn't waste it.

'If he is fit and ready to play then he's a great talent.' But the 25-year-old will have to wait even longer to make his comeback.
