These beautiful sculptures of exotic birds are the latest instalment from paper artist Diana Beltran Herrara.

Using fine French paper, Ms Herrara is able to recreate brightly-coloured rare birds in astonishing detail.

It can take weeks to make each bird using silicone glue, wire, tape, watercolours and inks and, of course, scissors.

The 26 year old artist began working with paper as a way of embracing her creative side when she was short of money and experimented with paper she at found at home, as well as paper collected from magazines.

After visiting Helsinki in Finland, she was stirred by the country's natural beauty and found she had a strong passion for nature and the environment.

Since then, the Colombian artist has taken her paper art to soaring new heights and uses birds found in the wild for inspiration.

Ms Herrera said: 'After my trip to Helsinki, I saw nature in a different way, I was inspired to create animals that capture the beauty of nature.

'Paper was always something I could find, I had lots of sheets of paper at home and I loved experimenting with a material I could find anywhere.

'I think through art we can show how important our environment is and really appreciate the things around us, it is important to respect the natural world.

'People are often surprised by how realistic the sculptures look, they can't believe that they are made simply with paper.

'I am going to start my studies at the University of the West of England in Bristol where I hope to try my hand at creating animals out of wood and ceramics but I am really interested in taking my paper art to a really high level.'
