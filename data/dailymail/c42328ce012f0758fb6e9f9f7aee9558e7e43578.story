Fitness trackers are designed to make you more active, but if all this extra exercise leaves you smelling less than fresh, Google has a solution.

A patent reveals the tech giant’s proposal for a digital deodorant which comprises a wearable sensor that detects physical movements to automatically emit a pleasant fragrance.

These sensors would also detect a rise in temperature and moisture, suggesting increased sweat levels and body odour.

A patent reveal Google's proposal for a wearable sensor that detects physical movements and automatically emits pleasant-smelling odours. The built-in spray dispenser - described in the files as a ‘fragrance emission device’ - would be activated and a fan would ‘waft’ the smell out of the wearable’s casing (illustrated)

The built-in spray dispenser – described in the files as a ‘fragrance emission device’ – would be activated and a fan would ‘waft’ the smell out of the wearable’s casing.

A warning would also be sent to the user before the smell is emitted, giving them the chance to disable the feature if they don’t want to release the odour - for example, in a busy gym or confined space.

‘The user may confirm the fragrance emission as planned, or may override the planned emission,’ explained the patent.

As with all patents, the latest filing doesn't mean Google is planning to release the product any time soon, or at all.

An alternative device, however, is currently raising money on Kickstarter.  

The Smart Spray accessory is a smartphone case fitted with a small vial designed to hold any liquid of the owner's choice. 

This could include perfume, suntan lotion, insect repellent, fresh breath spray or more.

The nozzle protrudes from the rear of the case and can be tucked away when not in use.

‘In one instance, the user may be planning on taking the rest of the day off after the walk, after which the user will go home and shower.’

Google also described the sensor as having ‘a communication and route suggesting portion.’

The device would be web-enabled to connect to social networks and determine the proximity of friends, for example.

The ‘route’ portion would then ‘provide an alternate route to travel such that the predicted odour may not offend others that are socially connected to the user and that travel the same routes as the user.’

A report recently concluded expensive wearables may be a waste of money because smartphones and apps are just as good - and in some cases better - at tracking steps.

It pitted Nike’s Fuelband, the Jawbone UP24 and Fitbit Flex against five apps.

The 10 top-selling devices and fitness apps in the US that were tested, were: Galaxy S4 Moves app, iPhone 5S Moves app, iPhone 5S Health Mate app, iPhone 5S Fitbit app, as well as Nike’s Fuelband, the Jawbone UP24, Fitbit Flex, Fitbit One Fitbit Zip and the Digi-Walker SW-200.

Earlier this week, a report concluded that expensive wearables may be a waste of money because smartphones and apps are just as good - and in some cases better - at tracking steps.

The study compared the performance of a five devices - including Nike’s Fuelband, the Jawbone UP24 and Fitbit Flex - against five apps.

They analysed their ability to count steps as these are often used to calculate other measures of physical activity, such as distance covered or calories.

The patent was filed by Google in August 2012 and awarded this week

@highlight

It details a sensor that detects physical activity and emits odours

@highlight

A built-in spray would activate and a fan would direct the fragrance

@highlight

This could be used to counteract the smell of sweat, for example

@highlight

Wearable sensor can also provide directions to avoid friends that could be ‘offended’ by any odour emitted

@highlight

And users would be able to change the fragrance, or stop it being released
