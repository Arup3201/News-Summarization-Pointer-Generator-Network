The dating app Tinder has come under fire over a ‘slut-shaming’ safe sex ad that is appearing in fictitious female profiles.

The campaign, created by the AIDS Task Force, suggests to male users that they may catch an STD from hooking up with female Tinder users with the tagline: 'You're probably not her only match. Use a condom.'

Responses to the ad have been vitriolic, with Twitter users calling it ‘disgusting’.

The campaign: Tinder has been accused of slut-shaming for a campaign created by the AIDS Task Force

One, Hayley Burrows wrote: 'This actually makes me sick.’

Another,
 Elise Garofalo, responded: ‘Two steps forward, one step back...’ and 
Audrey Blake, said that ‘slut-shaming just needs to stop.’

According
 to a video about the campaign, published by the Israeli advertising 
firm behind it, GREAT Interactive, Tinder's male users reach the message
 through fake female profiles. Each shows photos of an attractive woman 
posing suggestively alongside multiple partners.

The last photo in the fictitious profile’s slideshow reveals the app's controversial message.

A
 representative for Tinder told MailOnline that it was ‘not involved 
with this AIDS project in any way’ – and indeed it does seem that the app
 is simply being used as a platform for the AIDS Task Force message.

The
 Daily Dot, which initially noticed the ad, argues that the AIDS Task 
Force campaign is still effective, despite the anger surrounding it.

‘To
 be fair, the campaign is clever—what better way to spread a positive 
social message than to broadcast it on an app used by millions every 
day?’ writes reporter EJ Dickson. ‘And it’s never a bad idea to advocate
 for safer sex practices, especially on a platform that’s implicitly, if
 not explicitly, used primarily to find casual sex partners.’

Tagline: The campaign has been named The Tinder AIDS Project, but Tinder has denied involvement in its creation

How it works: The app has installed multiple fake profiles that feature attractive people posing with multiple partners of the opposite sex, telling men to use protection to protect against STDs

The site concurs with critics, however, that the ‘social message is compromised by blatant slut-shaming.’

But
 while GREAT Interactive’s video tells us that ‘having a one-night-stand
 has never been easier,’ Tinder’s 27-year-old creator insists otherwise.

Justin Mateen told the Huffington Post in December that Tinder isn’t a hook-up app, ‘because women aren’t wired that way.’

Tinder
 does not reveal how many users it has, but recently disclosed that it 
facilitates around 750million profile ratings per day, leading to more 
than 5million matches.

The 
platform’s international growth has become so astounding that Tinder 
says it plans to expand to China by the end of this year.
