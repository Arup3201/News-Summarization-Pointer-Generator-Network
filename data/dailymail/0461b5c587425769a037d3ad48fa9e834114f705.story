A British woman has died after a Boeing 737 passenger plane crashed and burst into flames, killing all 50 passengers and crew on board while trying to touch down at a Russian airport.

Donna Bull, 53, was on board a Tatarstan Airlines flight that had been attempting a second landing in the city of Kazan when it crashed.

Colleagues said today that Ms Bull was 'a very popular and well-respected member of staff' at Bellerbys College in Cambridge.

Tragedy: Tributes were paid to British mother Donna Bull, 53 (pictured), who was among 50 people who died when a Boeing 727 crashed during an attempted landing in the country's Tatarstan region

Colleagues said today that Ms Bull was 'a very popular and well-respected member of staff' at Bellerbys College in Cambridge

Valued: Ms Bull joined Bellerbys Cambridge in April last year as an A-levels programme manager

James Pitman, managing director for 
Study Group's higher education division - Bellerbys College and 
International Study Centres - confirmed Ms Bull's death and that of her 
Moscow-based colleague.

In a
 statement, he said: 'We have received confirmation of the very sad news
 that our Bellerbys colleagues Donna Bull and Yana Baranova were on the 
plane that crashed in the Russian city of Kazan yesterday.

'Donna
 had flown out from the UK to Moscow earlier in the day, where she met 
Yana, and the two were heading to Kazan for the start of a 10-day 
marketing trip.'

Mr Pitman said Ms Bull joined Bellerbys Cambridge in April last year as an A-levels programme manager.

'She
 was a very popular and well-respected member of staff and will be 
sorely missed by both her students and colleagues,' he said.

The college was closed for teaching on Monday but would open for staff and students to come together to grieve and counselling would be offered.

Mrs Bull had made previous marketing trips to Eastern Europe, including Kiev, Ukraine, earlier this year.

She was previously Head of Social Sciences and Careers Co-ordinator at Cambridge Centre for Sixth Form Studies.

Ms Baranova, although based in 
Moscow, forged close relationships with Bellerbys staff in the UK in her
 capacity as recruitment manager and will also be 'sorely missed', Mr 
Pitman said.

'We offer our heartfelt condolences to both families during this very difficult time.'

Mrs Bull lived in Cambridge with her family. Her husband was too upset to comment yesterday and said: 'I don't think we're going to say anything today.'

Footage: A shocking video purporting to show the Kazan crash has emerged, which shows the plane falling out of the sky like a stone

The plane erupts in a huge fireball when it hits the ground

Mourning: People at the international airport in Kazan lay flowers near a list with the names of passengers who were aboard the Tatarstan Airlines flight

The Ministry of Russian Emergencies released a list of the dead, which included Irek Minnikhanov, 23, the son of Tatarstan's governor

Destroyed: The debris of the Boeing 737 passenger airliner at the international airport in Kazan

Starting point: The plane took off from Domodedovo airport in Moscow

Tatarstan Airlines said it was grounding all its Boeing 737 planes pending an investigation into the crash

Carnage: Rescuers extinguishing fire at the site

Probe: The 737 had made several attempts to land and President Vladimir Putin has demanded a full investigation into the crash

Catastrophic: A fuel tank was said to have exploded as the plane came down

Witnesses: Reports said the plane appeared to lose altitude as it was making a second landing attempt, crashing and catching fire

The Ministry of Russian Emergencies released a list of the 
dead, which included Irek Minnikhanov, 23, the son of Tatarstan's governor, 
and Alexander Antonov, who headed the Tatarstan branch of the Federal 
Security Service, the main successor agency to the Soviet-era KGB.

Mr Antonov was accompanying newlywed Mr Minnikhanov, son of Rustam Minnikhanov, who wed Frenchwoman Antonia Guichard just three months ago.

Reports said the plane appeared to lose altitude as it was making a 
second landing attempt, crashing and catching fire.

Horror: Emergency workers sift through the wreckage of a Boeing 737 which crashed and burst into flames while trying to touch down at a Russian airport, killing all on board 

Worry: A woman reads a list with the names of passengers who were on board the tragic plane. There were no survivors 

State television showed a nighttime photograph of firefighters at the 
side of the aircraft after the flames had been extinguished.

'The aircraft collided with the ground on its second attempt to land,' said an air traffic control source.

Another source said the plane had made three attempts to land and lost altitude quickly in high winds and cloudy skies.

'The plane just fell,' Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov told reporters.

'The plane was vertical, practically vertical.'

This description tallied with shocking footage of the crash taken by an airport security camera, which showed the plane plummeting towards the ground and exploding in a huge fireball.

Sokolov added the black box flight recorders, which were found on Monday, would need to be analysed for more information.

Tatarstan Airlines said it was grounding all its Boeing 737 planes pending an investigation into the crash.

'The main versions are pilot error and technical problems, including equipment failure,' Alexander Poltinin, a senior regional investigator, said of the crash.

He said the plane's fuel tank had exploded on impact and it could take weeks for all the dead to be identified in the wreckage, scattered over a wide area.

'There are mostly just fragments of bodies, few corpses,' local health ministry official Nail Nigmatullin told the Interfax news agency.

Tragedy: Newlywed Irek Minnikhanov, 23, the son of the Tatastan regional governor, was named among the dead. He had married wife Antonia, right, just three months ago

Weather in the city 
soon after the crash was reported to be light precipitation and winds of about 8 
meters per second, or 18 mph.

Russia's Investigative Committee has opened a criminal 
probe into the horror.

The 
plane, which took off from Domodedovo airport in Moscow, crashed at 
7.20pm.

Grief: A psychologist at the airport speaks to relatives and friends of those who were on board

The Foreign Office said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in Kazan, Tatarstan, on November 17.

'We are in touch with local authorities and providing consular assistance to those affected.'

There were no immediate indications of what may have caused the crash.

Disaster: The Russian passenger airliner crashed while trying to land at the airport in the city of Kazan, in the west of the country

Probe: Federal investigators, wearing vests reading 'Russian Investigative Committee' arrive at the airport

Kazan, a city of about 1.1 million and the capital of the Tatarstan republic, is located on the Volga river, about 450 miles east of Moscow.

The republic is one of the wealthier regions of 
Russia because of its large deposits of oil. It is also is a major 
manufacturing center, producing trucks, helicopters and planes.

About 
half of the people who live in the republic are ethnic Tatars, most of 
whom are Muslims.

A spokesman for the Russian 
Emergencies Ministry, Irina Rossius, said there were 44 passengers and 
six crew members aboard and all had been killed.

Scene: The crash happened as the plane was coming into Kazan Airport, located around 450 miles east of Moscow, where the flight originated

There was no suggestion that terrorism was behind the crash.

Ambulance workers rushed to the airport to help, but found no survivors among the wreckage.

Early reports blamed pilot error or a technical problem, but few details were available on the circumstances of the tragedy.

President Vladimir Putin has demanded a full investigation into the 
crash.

A journalist who said she had flown on the same aircraft from Kazan to Moscow's Domodedovo airport earlier in the day told Channel One state television that the landing in Moscow had been frightening because of a strong vibration during the final minutes of the flight.

Bleak: A spokesman for the Russian Emergencies Ministry, Irina Rossius, said there were 44 passengers and six crew members aboard and all had been killed

'When we were landing it was not clear whether there was a strong wind, although in Moscow the weather was fine, or some kind of technical trouble or problem with the flight,' said Lenara Kashafutdinova.

'We were blown in different directions, the plane was tossed around. The man sitting next to me was white as a sheet.'

Russia has seen a string of deadly crashes in recent years. Some have 
been blamed on the use of aging aircraft, but industry experts point to a
 number of other problems, including poor crew training, crumbling 
airports, lax government controls and widespread neglect of safety in 
the pursuit of profits.

The last fatal airliner crash was in December, when a Russian-made 
Tupolev belonging to Red Wings airline careered off the runway at 
Moscow's Vnukovo airport, rolled across a snowy field and slammed into 
the slope of a nearby highway, breaking into pieces and catching fire. 
Investigators say equipment failure caused the crash, which killed five 
people.

A 2011 crash in Yaroslavl that killed 44 people including a professional
 hockey team was blamed on pilot error. And Russian investigators found 
that the pilots in two crashes that killed 10 and 47 people in recent 
years were intoxicated.
