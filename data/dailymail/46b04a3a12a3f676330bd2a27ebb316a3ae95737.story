The family of an industry heir brutally murdered in the Congo in 1960 have revealed new details of his death.

Mark Higgins, 20, from Worcester, Massachusetts, was on his way to a kibbutz in Israel after working for missionary Albert Schweitzer in a jungle village in Gabon when he was shot by soldiers and hacked by machetes.

The troops mistakenly believed he was a Belgian spy when they raided a house he was staying in.

More than 50 years after his grisly death, his cousin Clarinda has travelled to Africa to unearth more information about his slaying.

She has now released a book titled Against the Current: How Albert Schweitzer Inspired a Young Man's Journey which reveals the evidence she has discovered.

Mr Higgins was the son of  Worcester industrialist Carter Higgins and grandson of Higgins Armory Museum founder John Woodman Higgins.

He was destined to study at Yale University and move on to a senior position at his father's company, Worcester Pressed Steel.

But he shunned the choices and instead traveled to Africa in 1959 at the age of 18.

There he started work alongside the German-French philosopher at the Schweitzer Hospital in Lambaréné, Gabon. The complex set in a humid jungle included a leper village.

After 13 months with Dr. Schweitzer, Mark Higgins was off on a another journey in June 1960, with the idea of backpacking up through Africa to a kibbutz in Israel.

Concern: Mr Higgins boarded a steamboat travelling north in 1960, but wrote a letter home on board saying: 'Something is incredibly wrong' when he realized it was going in the wrong direction 

On June 30, 1960, the République du Congo achieved independence from Belgium. The country had formerly been called Belgian Congo. 

The situation led to a huge amount of violence and tension around the country. 

The gendarmerie and military force who mutinied against their former rulers began turnijng on Belgian citizens. 

Mr Higgins boarded a steamboat travelling north in 1960, but wrote a letter home on board saying: 'Something is incredibly wrong.'

All the other vessels were going down the Kasai River, but his was heading inland instead.

On July 25, 1960, Higgins was staying with a family in the town of Kasongo when armed mutineers looking for Belgians broke in.

'Mark raised his hands (and said), 'I'm American not Belgian,' ' Clarinda Higgins told the Worcester Telegram and Gazette. 'They shot him and macheted him.'

Memories: During her visit she met a 90-year-old man called Joseph (left) who still remembered Mark after more than half a century

Lambros Passialis, a Greek-African businessman living in the Democratic Republic of Congo who had been in touch with Mr Higgins, got in touch with the American consulate. 

In 2014 Clarinda Higgins returned to Gabon with her husband and two grown children to retrace Mark's footsteps. 

While there she met 90-year-old, Joseph, who had been there since at least the 1960s. Clarinda Higgins showed him a photograph of her cousin. After a pause, he said 'Oh, that's Mark.' 

'It was a mind-blowing experience to be at Schweitzer's,' Clarinda told the paper.

'It's still fully operating. Still a real jungle clinic. The dining room is still the same dining room.' 

She also explained part of the reason why she ventured to Africa.

'I adored him,' Mrs Higgins said. 'There was always this admiration. I remember three letters he wrote me. One was about working in the leper colony,' she added

In another letter, he told her ' 'I've learned something new, and it's the blessing to give help.' 

She said: 'He had found meaning in life. I get goose bumps when I read that letter. He had found meaning somehow. It was about helping and service.'  

Clarinda Higgins holds a bachelor's degree in Eastern Studies from Smith College and a master's degree in education. She taught elementary school for 11 years and has worked as an environmental educator since 1986. 

She was recognized with the Gold Award by the National Science Teachers Association.

Her husband and co-author William G. Armstrong Jr is a former Associated Press writer and public relations executive in New York.
