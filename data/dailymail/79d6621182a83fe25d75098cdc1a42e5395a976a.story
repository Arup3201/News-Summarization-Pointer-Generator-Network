Furious residents are calling for the closure of a controversial landfill site, which overflowed leaving the streets infested with rats and trees filled with rubbish.

Strong winds caused rubbish from the Blaydon Quarry, in Tyne and Wear, to be strewn across the neighbouring areas. 

Families living in nearby Ryton, Winlaton and Greenside said their children were not able to play outdoors as the litter from the quarry was being swept up in the gales. 

Some added they had been forced to take cattle from the fields.

Residents have called for Octagon Green Solutions to 'clean up their act' after rubbish from the landfill site was strewn across the streets, leaving trees filled with rubbish and causing an infestation of rats

People living Ryton, Winlaton and Greenside, in Tyne and Wear, picketed the site in Lead Road, Blaydon, calling for better measure to stop waste overflowing

Staging a protest outside the site's main gates, locals demanded operators Octagon Green Solutions 'clean up their act'. 

They also launched a petition calling for better measures to stop rubbish from overflowing.

But Blaydon MP Dave Anderson said the recent issue is just the latest in a 'catalogue of problems' and demanded the site, in Lead Road, be shut down.

He said: 'I am not surprised that local people have felt the need to protest about Blaydon Quarry. The operation of this site has caused no end of nuisance and disturbance over recent years.

'My office and local councillors have been in almost constant dialogue with the Environment Agency and the council in an attempt to resolve the mismanagement of the site by the operator.

'The recent outbreak of litter and highways issues are just the latest in a catalogue of problems.' 

But Blaydon MP Dave Anderson said the recent issue at the site is just the latest in a 'catalogue of problems'

Mr Anderson called for the controversial site, which has caused 'no end of nuisance and disturbance' over the years to be shut down

Local families, armed with placards, visited the site to demand its operators to start running the site responsibly. 

Sharon Westgarth, 43, of Greenside, said: 'It's happened quite a few times now but this was the final straw.

'We can't drive down the street because there are carrier bags flying all over, we have problems with rodents and there are always complaints about the smell.'

The mother-of-one added: 'There aren't any nets up so the rubbish gets out. Something needs to be done.' 

Stephen Coles, 44, said the problems have 'got worse and worse over the years.'

'On Friday the rubbish was blowing all over the place,' he said.

'We have had enough now. These people need to wake up and start running the site responsibly.

'We have been putting up with it for years now and enough is enough. We want them to clean up their act.'

Bosses at the quarry were served with a notice by officers from the Environment Agency following an investigation. 

But Mr Anderson said stronger action was needed, adding he will be meeting officers from the Environment Agency, Gateshead Council and Northumbria Police to review what action has been taken to ensure that Octagon Green Solutions 'take seriously their responsibilities going forward'

He said: 'Strong action by the authorities against the operator is now long overdue and so I have written to them requesting that the site is shut down, until effective measures are put in place to protect local communities and the environment. 

Stephen Coles said: 'We have been putting up with it for years now and enough is enough. We want them to clean up their act.' Octagon Green Solutions declined to comment

'I also want the authorities to be given greater powers over landfill site operators.'  

Environment Agency manager Julian Carrington added: 'We have started an immediate investigation into the circumstances which allowed this litter to escape from Blaydon and Pathhead landfill sites and our findings will determine what action we take against the site operators.

'Our officers were out on site over the weekend following a significant number of reports from local residents about wind-blown litter.

'We have served a notice on Octagon Green Solutions, which operates Blaydon Quarry landfill site, requiring it to clear the litter from the areas affected. This clean-up has begun and will continue until the litter is removed. 

'We have told both sites to install and better position additional litter fencing and will be monitoring these actions closely.' 

Octagon Green Solutions declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.
