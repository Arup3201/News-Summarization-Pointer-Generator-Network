After supposedly inventing Mother's Day in his country four years ago, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un has taken his unlikely stance on gender equality a step further.

During a visit to an airbase yesterday, the despot hailed International Women's Day by handing out free make-up and sending congratulations to the wives of airmen in honour of the occasion.

While not meeting any of the men's partners in person, he was said to have asked commanding officers to pass on his gifts of food and cosmetics.

His recognition of gender rights comes one week after female defectors in Seoul claimed women in North Korea do not receive sex education, are subjected to forced abortions and in the military are required to perform sexual favours on high-ranking men, the Independent reports.

North Korean paper Rodong Sinmun recently put forward the country's feminist credentials while criticising the 'discrimination against women workers protested in South Korea', who KCNA said were unable 'to live as human beings'.

Meanwhile, KCNA's main report on the anniversary of 'Kim Jong-il's work and International Women's Day' said the country had 'demonstrated its might as an example of the progressive women's movement of the world under the wise guidance of peerlessly great men'.

'The Korean women's movement greets the heyday of its development as it is led by Marshal Kim Jong Un,' it added before hailing Kim  as the inventor of 'Mother's Day, the first of its kind in Korean history' - four years ago.

As well as his nod to International Women's Day, the leader took the opportunity to heap praise on his late father Kim Jong-Il, noting his 'patriotism, faith, anti-imperialist class education and moral education', according to the Rodong Sinmun report.  

During the visit, the leader also demonstrated his green credentials after reportedly highlighting the need to develop wind, solar and geothermal energy to solve electricity problems.

The leader and his entourage are said to have flown to the site in his private plane - a Soviet-era IIyushin Il-62. 

His visit to the secretive state's air force unit was to inspect a new power station, but the leader also took the opportunity to tour the site's training facilities as well its washroom, kitchen, greenhouse and mushroom cultivation room. 

Kim, who was educated in Geneva and is thought to be 32, posed for photos with pilots, telling them they should always be  ready for combat and reminding them of the slogan: 'We wait only for the Party's order for missions!'

Praised father: The dictator, thought to be 32, also took the opportunity to mention former leader Kim Jong-Il's patriotism, faith, anti-imperialist class education and moral education' 

Defectors' revelations: His recognition of gender rights comes one week after female defectors in Seoul claimed women in North Korea do not receive sex education, are subjected to forced abortions and in the military are required to perform sexual favours on high-ranking men
