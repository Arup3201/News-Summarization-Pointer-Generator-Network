City centres aren’t the most obviously place to go skiing.

But for urban skiers Cam Riley and Clayton Villa, buildings, lamp posts and railings are more of a help than a hindrance.

In fact, they provide the perfect playground to carry out their breathtaking stunts and tricks.

Urban skiers often transform car parks, alleyways and flyovers into ski-playgrounds to perform their stunts

The high-risk winter sport is a mixture of extreme skiing and skateboarding and involves performing acrobatic jumps and tricks in an urban setting.

Cam, 26 from Boulder, Colorado, and Clayton, 23, from Rhode Island are two of the top urban skiers in the world, specialising in risky stunts on the snow.

They perform regularly on the streets of Boulder, Boston, Chicago, Duluth and Maine in the US and have now made a film documenting their exploits which has been presenter by adventurer Bear Grylls. 

Both athletes have been pushing the limits of extreme skiing by transforming car parks, alleyways and flyovers into urban-ski-playgrounds.

Urban skiing has become increasingly popular since it first surfaced around 15 years ago in the US

The high-octane sport revolves around finding features to do tricks on in the city.

Cam and Clayton have both been skiing their entire lives and started urban skiing in high-school at around 15 years old.

They claim to have been influenced by other extreme sports like snowboarding and skateboarding.

The sport has become increasingly popular since it first surfaced around 15 years ago, when people first started filming each other sliding down handrails on snowboards or skis.

The skiers say that cities allow them to be more creative, and offer greater variety than traditional ski resorts.

Outside the North America, the region in which urban skiing is most common is Scandinavia

‘Skiing was born in the mountains and it always will be a mountain sport, but it's cool to bring it into the streets and just put a different spin on it,’ said skier Sandy Boville.

First, the skiers have to scout out features on which they can perform an original trick.

In many cases, police are quick to put a stop to urban skiing as property owners often complain about damaged being caused to buildings

Skiers also regularly suffered broken bones, torn ligaments, and concussions.

‘We usually start with high schools and parks and that sort of area because the architecture's usually conducive - there are stairs and railings and balconies,’ skier Logan Imlach said in an interview with the BBC.

‘You branch out to really anywhere in cities - wherever there's concrete and metal there's a good chance that you can ski on it.’
