Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho appeared to take a dig at Liverpool for letting Steven Gerrard leave when his contract expires. 

The Reds stalwart will join MLS outfit LA Galaxy in the summer, bringing the curtain down on 17 years at Anfield.

Gerrard hit the post as Liverpool came from behind to hold Chelsea to a 1-1 draw in Tuesday night's Capital One Cup semi-final first leg.

Blues boss Mourinho was pictured speaking to Liverpool counterpart Brendan Rodgers in the corridor after the game.

And the Special One believes the ex-England star should stay in the Premier League and hinted his rivals should have done more to keep him.

When asked if he would make a cheeky bid to sign him, Mourinho told 5 Live: 'Or perhaps to take him on loan? 

'I'm not happy he leaves, I would love the Premier League to keep hold of the best players and I think he has more than those qualities to play in the Premier League.'

The tongue-in-cheek remark comes after long-serving former Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard ended up with Manchester City this season, after an apparent deal with New York City FC seemed to mean his Premier League career was over. 

Gerrard's costly slip led to a goal as Liverpool lost 2-0 in the same fixture last April as Manchester City went on to beat them to the title.

Mourinho, who tried to sign Gerrard in 2005, urged the Chelsea faithful not to boo the midfielder in the build up to Tuesday's clash.

Eden Hazard had put the visitors in the driving seat when he converted from the spot after being bundled over by Emre Can.

However, Raheem Sterling's superb solo strike rescued a draw for Liverpool to leave the tie finely poised. 

Mourinho added: 'I think it was a really big game, we played to the top of our potential and Liverpool the same.

'A proper semi-final and a fair result. Liverpool did not deserve to lose, they performed really well. We were in control but with more quality in our passing we could find space and score more goals.

'I am not saying we are the favourites. The semi-final is now one leg.'
