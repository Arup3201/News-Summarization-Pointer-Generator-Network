He's always got plenty to say on issues ranging from alternative medicine to architecture and climate change.

So the Prince of Wales must have jumped at the chance to get his hands on Country Life as a guest editor.

Charles – who agreed to turn journalist to mark his 65th birthday next week – features on the front cover of the magazine looking particularly ruddy-faced in a photograph taken in the garden of Birkhall, his Scottish retreat.

The prince, who has never edited a 
national publication before, was given free rein to choose the majority 
of the 116-year-old weekly magazine’s content.

He
 has, among other things, chosen his top ten ‘Countryside Champions’ and
 commissioned an architect from his Foundation for Building Community to
 design a solution to deliver affordable rural housing.

The magazine also contains features on the prince’s home in Wales and, well, his views on everything from art to books and food.

He has also commissioned his friend, TV presenter Alan Titchmarsh, to write about his gardens.

Country Life editor Mark Hedges and 
his editorial team were also invited to cover The Prince’s work with 
rural communities, reflecting his ‘exceptional knowledge’ of farming and
 his passion and vision to safeguard the future of the countryside.

Mr Hedges said: ‘The commemorative edition is a unique record of The 
Prince’s love of the countryside and his commitment to preserving its 
way of life.

‘The Prince has overseen the content of this special issue, from selecting contributors and suggesting features to writing the leader and contributing to reader favourites.

‘We met The Prince to discuss progress and worked with a designated team over an eight month period to get the issue off the ground.

‘Since its launch in 1897, Country Life has been privileged to be given access to the Royal Family at times of national celebrations and we are delighted that the Prince allowed us to mark his 65th birthday by guest editing Country Life – a present to share with the entire nation.’

The commemorative edition of Country Life will be on sale from November 13.
