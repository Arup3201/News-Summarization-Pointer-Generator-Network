Working from home has become a way of life for many employees.

But when your home is 4,000 miles from the voters who put you in office, questions are going to be asked. 

Brian Riley insists he'll still be able to represent the people of Hadleigh in Suffolk when he moves to Raleigh in North Carolina.

And, despite being an ocean and a four-hour time difference away, the 71-year-old will be entitled to keep claiming his annual allowance of £10,274.

The former banker, whose daughter is Sky Sports News presenter Kate Riley, is under pressure from leaders at Tory-run Suffolk council to quit before March 20 so that a by-election can coincide with the May 7 general election.

But he is legally entitled to hold the seat until the next county council election in 2017 as long as he attends a meeting every six months. Candidates must live in the UK to stand.

Despite having had the Conservative whip withdrawn by furious colleagues on Tuesday, Mr Riley has refused to back down.

He claims modern technology and regular trips to the UK will allow him to stay in touch with his constituents.

'I am moving to the USA but I shall be coming back to the UK every six or seven weeks to keep up with my council work,' said Mr Riley, whose wife Alice, 66, is American.

'We are in the 21st century with emails and Skype and there are plenty of ways of keeping in touch with people in Hadleigh. It isn't a case of gathering around the parish pump any more.'

He confirmed he would resign his other seat – on Babergh district council – because it involved 'nitty gritty issues' but would be able to continue as a county councillor because the role was 'more strategic'.

Mr Riley even said he would have time to help the campaign to get Hillary Clinton to the White House.

The presidential election takes place next year – meaning he will have even less time for his constituents if the former first lady is chosen as candidate for the Democrats.

Tory leader Mark Bee yesterday said his colleague had caused outrage. 

'If a councillor moves out of the county it looks like an awkward relationship but it beggars belief to be in the United States,' he said.

'We don't think it represents the spirit of being a locally elected representative.'

Labour opposition leader Sandy Martin said the situation was 'completely bonkers'. 

He added: 'It is all very well saying he will use Skype but a lot of people don't like talking over the phone or by computer.'

John O'Connell of the TaxPayers' Alliance said the case highlighted the need to introduce a recall mechanism to allow voters to kick out absent councillors. 

'They hand over hard-earned money to their councillors and rightly expect to get their money's worth when it comes to democratic representation,' he added.

Mr Riley, who worked for 28 years at Standard Chartered bank before becoming a business consultant, has been summoned to a meeting with Mr Bee where he is expected to come under pressure to resign.

In August last year a Liberal Democrat councillor triggered uproar by taking a £180,000-a-year job in Saudi Arabia, 4,000 miles from his ward in Hampshire, which paid a £13,000 allowance.
