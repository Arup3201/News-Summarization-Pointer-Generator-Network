Tv star Lorraine Kelly, 54, said woman 'want to look fantastic'

Forget thongs and frills, for when it comes to fashion the woman over 50 would far rather hang on to her jeans than fancy lingerie.

Comfort rather than style appears to the mantra of the nation’s mature women, who feel high street chains are ignoring them.

In fact, women over 50 are emerging as Britain’s most powerful consumer group and they are a hugely lucrative market for the fashion industry with annual sales worth some £6.7billion.

Yet a new study says that too often designers and retailers fail to understand them and what they want from clothes.

The research, commissioned by retailer JD Williams, found that just 20per cent of mature women feel well catered for on the high street and 61per cent feel that their age group is forgotten.

Around one in three said they felt pressured by the big chains to dress younger than their years.

And when they were asked about their favourite piece of clothing, a pair of jeans came out top with 15per cent putting it at number one, while just one per cent named lingerie.

This might have something to do with the comfort offered by a well cut pair of jeans, for the study found 71per cent rate comfort over style when it comes to fashion.

Researchers asked older women which parts of their body they felt most negative about and wanted help with. Top was the stomach at 64per cent, ahead of the upper arms at 35per cent and thighs at 28per cent.

Given these findings, it is not surprising that some 57per cent of the women questioned said they would like to lose weight.

The study said: ‘Fifty-three per cent of women aged 50+ feel that it can be hard to find clothing that suits them, with 22per cent saying they would like to buy more fashionable clothes but find clothes shopping intimidating.

‘Sixty-six per cent of mature women feel they would like to see more choice from fashion retailers suited to their age group.’

JD Williams has commissioned daytime TV star Lorraine Kelly to create her own collection next year. Earlier this year, she fronted a fashion campaign for the retailer.

Jeans, like this pair by Armani, were named the favourite piece of clothing by women over 50

The 54-year-old said: ‘These women have the spending power and they want to look fantastic, it doesn’t matter what size or age they are, we have neglected them. I know this from my own experience.’

She said she knows many women her age who have struggled to find clothes that flatter a slightly older figure while remaining stylish.

‘Fashion is all about feeling comfortable in your own skin and all of the clothes that I’ve chosen make me feel great,’ she said.

The study also asked older women about the advantages and challenges of growing old.

Some 22per cent said they were excited about getting a bus pass, which ranked slightly higher than a pension. They were looking forward to more leisure time, having grandchildren and spending time with friends and family.

Just 10per cent were worried about getting wrinkles, while 77per cent have ruled out any form of plastic surgery.

Angela Spindler, the 52-year-old chief executive of N Brown Group, which owns JD Williams, said: ‘Shopping for clothes should be easy and enjoyable whether you’re 16 or 60.

‘There are more women in the 50+ bracket than ever before and it’s abundantly clear that they have felt let down by the fashion industry.

‘Recent years have seen this population of women emerge as the most powerful consumer group and the fastest growing fashion sector. No longer does 50 signal the start of the slow decline into old age, it now marks the midpoint of a woman’s life.

‘We hope this report heralds a wake-up call to the fashion, retail and media industries to give these women what they want, in the way we do. It’s our job to empower; after all ignoring them should be done with peril.’
