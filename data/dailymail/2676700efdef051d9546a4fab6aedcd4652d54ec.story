A woman is fighting for life after being hit by a police car on a 999 call which friends claim was not using its siren.

Laura McEwan was out celebrating her 33rd birthday with pals when the accident happened as she walked along a busy road.

She was rushed to hospital with life-threatening head injuries and more than a week later remains in intensive care in a critical condition.

Laura McEwan was struck by a police car as she celebrated her 33rd birthday in Bristol late last month 

Friends claimed that this police car, pictured, was not using its siren at the time of the incident 

Ms McEwan is currently being treated in Southmead Hospital in Bristol where she is in a 'critical condition'

The accident in the Stokes Croft inner city area of Bristol is now being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

One of Laura's distraught friends, who has given evidence to the IPCC, said she didn't hear any sirens before the marked police Ford Focus hit her.

The friend, who did not want to be named, said: 'I was out with her in Stokes Croft that night. It was terrible.

'One minute we were celebrating her birthday, the next the road was closed off and Laura was in an ambulance.

'I've given evidence to the IPCC.

'I saw a number of police cars speeding up the road with their blue lights on, but I didn't hear any sirens. Not one.'

The crash around 10pm on Saturday November 29 happened as a number of police vehicles responded to reports of a man making threats with a knife.

A man was later arrested on suspicion of assault and a knife was seized.

The road near the accident was closed after the collision as a detailed examination of the scene took place.

Ms McEwan, who is believed to be originally from Wales, is being treated in Bristol's Southmead Hospital but her friend claimed she has been denied access.

The accident happened at the junction of Nine Tree Hill and Cheltenham Road in Bristol on November 29

She said: 'What concerns me the most is that Laura's friends are her family and we can't get into the hospital to see her.

'We're all distraught. She's lying there in a critical condition and we're all feeling totally helpless.'

The IPCC said: 'The 33-year-old woman involved in the road traffic collision on November 29 is still in a critical condition.

'The witness appeal has been successful with several people contacting the witness appeal line over the phone and email. Several witness statements have been set up.

'We are investigating all elements of the incident.'

A police spokesman confirmed Ms McEwan was in a life-threatening condition, but both Avon and Somerset Constabulary and Southmead Hospital refused to comment on visiting access.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission said they were still investigating all aspects of the incident and wanted any further eyewitnesses to come forward. 

It is understood that investigators will try and determine whether the squad car was using its emergency sirens and lights at the time of the collision. 

Ms McEwan is a past pupil of King Henry VIII School in Abergavenny, Wales, and worked in internal communications with Lloyds Bank before taking up a job at the University of Bath. 

Following the crash, IPCC investigators visited the crash site and handed out letters appealing for any information.

IPCC associate commissioner Guido Liguori said: 'There will have been a number of people enjoying a Saturday night out in the vicinity of where the collision happened, and we would urge anyone who may have witnessed the incident to come forward and assist our investigation.

'Our investigation is at an early stage and my thoughts are with the woman and her family at this difficult time.'

Following the collision Avon and Somerset police said the police car which hit Laura was 'on an emergency blue light run'.

A spokesperson for the force said: 'Because a police vehicle has been involved, the force's professional standards department have been advised.

'The incident has also been referred to the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Commission).

'We are keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the area at the time who may have information to help our investigation.'
