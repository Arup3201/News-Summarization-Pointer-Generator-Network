Hundreds of miners at Britain's deepest coal mine which was devastated by an underground fire were given the sack by text, it emerged today.

The 650 miners at Daw Mill Colliery near Fillongley, Warwickshire, were given their marching orders after their shifts finished on Wednesday night.

Heartless UK Coal bosses which runs the colliery told staff the pit was closing by text.

It read: 'Colleagues, I apologise for the late note. It is important to me that you hear from me personally that the company will formally announce the closure of Daw Mill without chance of reprieve tomorrow [Thursday] morning.

'A detailed update will follow. Best regards, M. Haworth.'

The announcement came just three weeks after a fierce blaze destroyed equipment and left it with no more workable coal.

Yesterday workers expressed outrage at the way staff were told the devastating news.

Father-of-one Dave Meuse, 55, from nearby Nuneaton, who has worked at the mine since leaving school 38 years ago, said: 'It's heart breaking. There have been grown men openly crying.

Foreboding: Miners said the fire meant all the coal-face equipment had been taken away and the shafts had been flooded, so it was 'fairly obvious' that the pit would not re-open

'I've seen blokes who have been here 
as long as me walking out with just a small bag in their hands, carrying
tools they are never likely to use again.

'We did fear the worst because of the serious extent of the fire, which is still burning.

'All
the coal-face equipment has gone and the shafts have been flooded, so 
it was fairly obvious that the pit would not re-open.

'Even so, the sudden closure has come as a devastating shock.

'We were given the news on Wednesday night by text message, which could, perhaps, have been done better.

'But the management explained that they wanted everyone to know before the statement was released to the media.'

Historic: Daw Mill is the last remaining mine in the Warwickshire coalfields and will shut after 47 years of production

As
branch secretary of the Union of Democratic Mine workers, Mr Meuse is 
now helping to negotiate redundancy terms for his 400 members.

He said: 'Things are a little uncertain at the moment.

'The
company is looking for financial support from the government to be able
to make enhanced payments, which is what we are hoping for.

'Some
men are being retained temporarily for the close-down operation and 
around 70 have been offered jobs at Thoresby Colliery in 
Nottinghamshire.

'But otherwise, that's it for the rest of us; the end of the line.

'Coal mining is in my blood and it is so sad to see the way the industry has declined.'

A spokesman for UK coal said the texts had been sent as a last resort because they had not wanted employees to learn about the closure on the news.

He said: 'We were determined that our employees should hear about the closure from the company rather than hear it on the news the next day.

'I'm bitterly disappointed that some have complained at being given advance warning that the mine was to close.

'At briefing sessions immediately after the fire, we asked all employees to ensure we had their contact details so that we could update them on developments.

'Most provided email addresses and received a more detailed and compassionate message.

'Unfortunately,Â  some didn't have email addresses and others chose not to provide one.

'As such, they were contacted via their mobile phone - the route they had chosen to be contacted by.

'I appreciate that this is a difficult time but we have worked extremely hard to keep our employees informed using the routes they chose. As such, this criticism is totally unjustified and very disappointing.'

Gary Butler, 47, from Polesworth, Warks., has worked at the mine for 25 years.

He said: 'It's the only job I've ever done and I really don't know what the future will bring, although I am trying to remain positive.'

Mr Butler, 47, was one of the 106 miners evacuated when the fire broke out 740 metres below the surface, on February 22.

He added: 'The emergency procedure kicked in and everyone got out okay.

'We all knew then what the final outcome would be.

Deserted: There were 106 miners in the mine and had to be evacuated when the fire broke out 740 metres below ground on February 22

'It's a shame this has all happened just when production was beginning to pick up.'

Andy Frith, 44, has travelled to Daw Mill from his home in Whitwick, Leics., said he was disgusted at the way he was told he had lost his job.

He fumed: 'It was common knowledge that the pit was finished but to get the news by text was terrible.

'I am not at all happy with the way we have been treated by the company.

'I have a wife and daughter to support and it's now a question of waiting to see what sort of redundancy package will be offered.

'I have also been for an interview at Thoresby Colliery but have not heard anything.'

Daw Mill is the last remaining mine in the Warwickshire coalfields and will shut 
after 47 years of production.
