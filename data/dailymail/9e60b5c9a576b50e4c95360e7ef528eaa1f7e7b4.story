Michael Ballack says he sympathises with Mesut Ozil over his struggles to adapt at Arsenal, but that his body language must improve on the pitch.

The former Chelsea mdifielder, a German team-mate of the playmaker, also believes Ozil should have fought for longer at Real Madrid.

The 25-year-old made the £42.5m switch from La Liga to the Premier League last summer.

Competition: Ballack believes Ozil should have stayed and fought for his place at Real Madrid

'For me in particular, I would have liked to see more time fighting in Madrid [from Ozil]', Ballack said in a Q&A with Spanish publication Marca.

'It was a shame, because I'm sure Cristiano Ronaldo and Benzema would have loved him to continue, because Ozil is a very generous player.'

Ballack ranks his beloved Germany, along with Spain, as his favourites for the World Cup this summer, with Ozil a key part of Joachim Low's passing football.

But he struggled at times at the Emirates Stadium, with many fans getting on his back for a poor attitude at times.

And Ballack believes his body language should be better considering how gifted he is.

Pressure: And Ozil's place for Germany at the World Cup is under threat

'His transfer from Madrid to Arsenal started fine, but then it has been hard to adapt, because English football is very complicated.

'Özil is one of our best players, a large number '10 ', but doesn't assume a lot of responsibility.

'He is a free player on the field, which has great influence on the game, with amazing quality, but sometimes his body language is not what it should be for a player of his class.'

German media suggest Ozil will start for Germany in their World Cup opener against Portugal on Monday, but that it will be his last chance.
