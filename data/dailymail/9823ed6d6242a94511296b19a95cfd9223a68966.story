Like many an expectant mother, Rachel Gibson went for her 12-week pregnancy scan full of excitement at seeing her unborn baby.

And despite the scan and a subsequent blood test revealing the baby had a one in 90 chance of having Down’s syndrome, she refused to become despondent.

She says she was offered the prospect of an abortion if another test confirmed doctors’ fears – but instead trusted in her ‘instinct’ that the baby would be fine.

Rachel Gibson says she was offered an abortion by doctors who warned she her unborn baby was at high risk of being born with Down's syndrome

But despite the odds, she and her partner refused and welcomed their healthy baby son, Zane, last June 

Yesterday the mother-of-three posed proudly with healthy baby Zane as she urged other women to ‘trust in their own instincts’, and told how she would have had the baby whether or not her unborn son had been diagnosed with Down’s syndrome.

Mrs Gibson, 33, of Stoke, said: ‘It was a very worrying time when we were told Zane was at high risk of being born with Down’s syndrome but it goes to show that sometimes doctors can be wrong.

‘We had a one in 90 chance of having a Down’s syndrome baby, which is high risk, but ... tests in pregnancy aren’t always right.’

Research suggests a woman her age would normally have a one in 1,000 chance of having a Down’s syndrome baby.

She said that following Zane’s birth last June doctors confirmed he did not have Down’s syndrome, and added: ‘In my mind I knew he was going to be healthy because he was moving all the time (in the womb) and I just had an instinct he would be fine.’

Doctors first became concerned for the Mrs Gibson when she was diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum, the extreme form of morning sickness suffered by the Duchess of Cambridge in both of her pregnancies.

A fortnight later, she was in hospital for six days when the condition, which is characterised by extreme sickness and nausea, worsened.

At the 12-week scan doctors detected excess fluid on the back of the baby’s neck, which can suggest a possible case of Down’s syndrome.

Blood tests were ordered and the results also suggested a risk of Down’s, as high as one in 90.

The teaching assistant and her partner Darren, 34, an HGV driver, were offered the option of an amniocentesis - a procedure used to obtain a small sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the foetus during pregnancy.

Although the procedure can diagnose Down’s syndrome, it increases the risk of miscarriage to 1 in 100, while the risk of developing a serious infection is put at 1 in 1,000. Early amniocentesis - before the 14th week of pregnancy - has also been linked to increased risk of the baby developing club foot.

Ms Gibson urged other pregnant women to trust their instincts, claiming she knew Zane would be ok

Mrs Gibson said she was told an abortion would be an option if she had the test and it came back positive for Down’s.

She added: ‘I had a number of phone calls from staff at the hospital about taking the test. I got the impression they were pushing for me to have it but I refused every time.

‘They said the procedure would create an increased risk of miscarriage so we decided against it.

‘The combination of my illness and the risk of the baby having the disease was why they mentioned an abortion at that stage.

‘The doctors said both myself and the baby were at risk but termination was never an option for us.’

Mrs Gibson, who also has daughters Naomi, 13, and seven-year-old Amelia from a previous relationship, gave birth naturally to 8lb 9oz Zane at Royal Stoke University Hospital in Staffordshire.

She said the traumatic pregnancy has ‘made me love Zane even more’.

Dr Michelle Mohajer, a consultant in obstetrics and foetal medicine at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust, said it would be ‘most unusual’ for a hospital to advise or offer a termination after only a scan and blood test.

The NHS operates a foetal anomaly screening programme which is open to all expectant mothers in England. Its policy is to offer an abortion only after a diagnosis for the condition is confirmed by the amniocentesis test.

Dr Anne Mackie, director of programmes for the NHS Screening Programmes, said: ‘The NHS Foetal Anomaly Screening Programme provides all pregnant women in England with high quality information and support so they can make an informed choice about screening for Down’s Syndrome and a number of physical abnormalities in their unborn baby.

‘Women are encouraged to carefully consider the benefits and possible harms of screening in light of their own values before making a decision.’
