It wasn’t quite the kind of takeaway the customer had in mind.

But a dispute with a member of staff at a fast-food shop ended abruptly when the worker smacked her customer over the head with a pizza shovel.

Dalgit Din ‘snapped’ when Deborah Williamson refused to leave the Spice of Life shop in Arbroath, Angus, on December 27.

Smack! A video captured by Miss Williams' boyfriend shows Din lifting the pizza shovel - used to take food out of the oven - and hitting Miss Williams over the head while dealing with another customer

Assault: Din, 64, approaches the counter in Spice of Life in Arboath, Angus, pizza shovel in hand. The court heard Din lost the plot when Miss Williamson refused to leave the shop after being told she was banned

The 64-year-old grabbed the implement – used to take pizzas in and out of the oven – while dealing with another customer as Miss Williamson ranted at her.

Video footage of the incident captured by Miss Williamson’s boyfriend then shows Din attacking her – lifting the metal shovel with both hands and hitting her over the head.

The film – uploaded to YouTube under the title ‘Mayfield takeaway... don’t forget your crash helmet’ – was shown to Forfar Sheriff Court yesterday.

The court heard Din lost the plot when Miss Williamson refused to leave the shop after being told she was banned. Din, 64, of Dundee, pleaded guilty to assault.

Ian Flynn, defending, said Miss Williamson had previously been a ‘nuisance’ in the shop and had been asked not to return.

He added: ‘It took the police 15 minutes to get there and the aggravation continued. He [the partner] was charged with smashing the door down before police attended.

Dispute: Din can be seen arguing with Miss Williams in the YouTube video. Ian Flynn, defending, said Miss Williamson had previously been a 'nuisance' in the shop and had been asked not to return

Scene of the incident: Din's lawyer told the court that it took police 15 minutes to get to the takeaway shop, pictured, and the aggravation continued before they arrived

'She’s not the complainer, because neither she nor the boyfriend wanted anything to do with helping the police.’

During a section of the video shown in court, Din phones the police and shouts: ‘I’ve got a junkie in my shop.’ But Mr Flynn added: ‘She is not, at 64, likely to reoffend.’

Sheriff Gregor Murray told Din: ‘I’m going to give you six months to be of good behaviour.’

Sentence was deferred until January 29.
