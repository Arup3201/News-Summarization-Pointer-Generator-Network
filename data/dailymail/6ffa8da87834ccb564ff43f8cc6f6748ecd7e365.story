An 11-year-old boy's survival from a near-fatal battle with a flesh-eating bacteria has been declared a miracle by the Vatican.

Jake Finkbonner, of Ferndale, Washington, made a stunning recovery from a tissue-destroying disease that gnawed away at his young face and nearly took his life in 2006.

Pope Benedict XVI attributed the miracle attribute to The Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha, clearing the way for the 17th century Mohawk-Algonquin woman to become the first American-Indian saint.

Jake was only five when he cut his lip during the last minute of a Boys & Girls Club basketball game on February 11, 2006.

Recalling the incident on his website, he describes how he was running down court with the ball when he stopped in front of the hoop to shoot and was pushed from behind.

'I flew forward and hit my mouth on the base of the portable basketball hoop,' he writes.

And there, on the surface of the hoop, was Strep A bacteria, which causes a deadly disease known as necrotizing fasciitis, otherwise known as a flesh-eating bacteria that that most patients have a 50-50 chance of surviving.

The next day, Jake was fighting for his 
life. Admitted to Children's Hospital in Seattle, he was diagnosed with a
severe infection that began spreading across his face, head and chest.

'We do not discredit the doctors who helped our son. We know that without them, our son would not have survived.'

MSNBC.com reports with Jake's prognosis grim, the family’s priest, Fr Tim Sauer, was called in to administer what he thought would be last rites.

But at his urging, Jake's parents, 
Elsa and Don Finkbonner, began praying to Tekakwitha, who converted to 
Christianity when she was 18 despite facing persecution for joining the 
faith. 

Her face was scarred by smallpox as a 
child, but legend has it that just minutes after she died in 1680, aged 
just 24, she shone brightly and all the marks from smallpox vanished 
from her face, revealing her true beauty.

Family, friends and neighbours joined them in praying for Tekakwitha to intercede.

Then, on Jake's ninth day in hospital, he took a sudden turn for the better.

Sauer told the website a relic of 
Tekakwitha was brought to his bedside, placed on a pillow next to his 
head. His health continued to improve. About eight weeks later, Jake was
cleared to go home.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare infection of the deeper layers of skin.

It can be caused by many types of bacteria, which usually enter via an open wound, for example following surgery.

Despite being known as a ‘flesh-eating’ bug, the bacteria do not actually eat the tissue.

They cause the destruction of skin and muscle by releasing toxins.

Symptoms usually begin with patients complaining of intense pain in the area where the infection began.

In the early stages, signs of inflammation may not appear.

Redness and swollen or hot skin will show up quicker if the bacteria is closer to the surface of the skin.

As the disease progresses, skin colour may change to violet and blisters may form, with tissue then turning black as it dies.

Patients with necrotizing fasciitis typically have a fever and appear very ill. Diarrhoea and vomiting are also common symptoms.

Mortality rates have been noted as high as 73 per cent if left untreated.

Once the disease is diagnosed it is almost always necessary to cut away the infected tissue to stop it from spreading.

Sauer said he then sent a letter to 
the Seattle archbishop detailing the possible miracle. The Vatican sent 
investigators to Ferndale and Seattle, where they interviewed hospital 
doctors and followed-up on the claims.

The Congregation for Causes of Saints, a committee of cardinals and bishops in Rome, reviewed the case and presented it to the pope, who on Monday signed a decree authenticating the miracle attribute to The Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha.

She could be canonised as early as February, becoming America's first indigenous saint.

Mrs Finkbonner told MSNBC her son, meanwhile, is 'doing fantastic' and is playing basketball again.

'He’s an excellent student, a typical,
happy 11-year-old-boy who plays video games and punches his sister in 
the head and makes her cry,' she said.

The mother told MailOnline it was 'unexplainable' how Jake survived his illness.

And while she said even doctors are 
baffled as to Jake's recovery, the family does not discredit the 
intervention of medical technology they say was essential to his 
survival.

In an email to MailOnline, Mrs 
Finkbonner wrote: 'We do not discredit the doctors who helped our son. 
We know that without them, our son would not have survived.

'This 
investigation took place by an panel of priests, doctors and lawyers 
from the Catholic church.  They interviewed us along with the doctors 
who treated Jake,' she added.

'These are the same doctors who have 
stated that they could not explain why Jake lived. They did everything 
humanly possible for him and can not explain why he survived.'

In fact, the experience has even made Jake consider becoming a doctor himself.

'[It] Makes me feel like I’m doing something for God, bringing more people back into his community,' he told KOMO.

Kateri Tekakwitha, also known as 
Caterina Tekakwitha, was born in 1656 in nearby Auriesville but her 
parents - one of whom was a Mohawk Chief named Kenneronkwa - and brother
died of smallpox when she was aged only four.

She survived but was given the 
unfortunate surname because of her poor vision - as it literally means 
'she who bumps into things'.

She was looked after by her uncle, a 
Turtle Clan chief who hated Christianity, but a conflict moved her four 
miles north-west to Caughnawaga, New York, aged ten.

Despite her disfigured face from 
smallpox, a number of men were interested in marrying her. But Kateri 
decided to stay celibate because she believed they only wanted her for 
political gain.

It was as she thought more about the potential of a loveless marriage, she started to find out about Christianity.

Her mother had given her a set of 
rosary prayer beads but her uncle had taken them away because he did not
want her to become a Catholic. But she became more and more interested 
in the faith.

Caterina then began Catholic teaching 
in secret aged 18. Her uncle eventually allowed this as long as she 
stayed in their village.

Saint: Kateri, or Caterina, Tekakwitha is credited by the Vatican with Jake's miraculous recovery. She lived from 1656-1680 in the U.S. and Canada, and became the first Native American to be beatified in 1980

She was persecuted by her fellow 
villagers for joining the faith but soon escaped to the Mission of St. 
Francis Xavier - a Canadian settlement.She was known for her gentleness, kindness, and good humour, according to the website of her shrine in Fonda.

She vowed to stay a virgin for her whole life in 1679 in Canada and taught children to pray, as well as working with the elderly and sick.

She died in 1680 after a serious illness and was buried in Quebec, Canada. She was said to appear to many people after her death and held responsible for two miracles.

She is joined on the list of seven newly-approved Catholic saints, including Mother Marianne of Hawaii, who cared for leprosy patients on Hawaii's Molokai peninsula in the 1880s, soon after the death of Father Damien, who was canonized in 2009.

Benedict also signed decrees that 65 Catholics died as martyrs during Spain's civil war and will be beatified, one step shy of possible sainthood.

The blessed: Mother Marianne cared for leprosy patients on Hawaii's Molokai peninsula

Pope Benedict XVI has approved seven new saints for the Catholic Church, including Hawaii's Mother Marianne and a 17th-century Native American, Caterina Tekakwitha.

Benedict signed decrees Tuesday approving miracles attributed to the intercession of the seven, clearing the last hurdle before their canonizations.

Marianne cared for leprosy patients on Hawaii's Molokai peninsula in the late 1880s, soon after the death of Father Damien, who was canonized in 2009. Tekakwitha, who lived from 1656-1680 in the U.S. and Canada, became the first Native American to be beatified in 1980.

Also on the list is Italian Giovanni Battista Piamarta, born in 1841 and founder of two religious orders; French Jacques Berthieu, a Jesuit priest shot to death in Madagascar in 1896 for defending Christianity; Spanish nun Mary of Mount Carmel who in 1892 founded the Congregation of the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception.

The teenager Pedro Calungsod, martyred in 1672 for defending missionaries, will be the second saint in Philippine history.

Germany's Anna Schäfer, who was then bedridden for 24 years and offered her pain for the salvation of souls after suffering burns on her legs in 1901 is also among the seven blessed.
