Glorious failure was England’s shattering fate at Eden Park on Saturday, but their dejected, defiant response told its own story of rising standards and ambitions.

After pushing the world champions to the brink of a monumental upset, Stuart Lancaster and his squad made it plain that being gallant losers will not suffice.

There was a collective satisfaction about the way they had overcome considerable pre-match adversity to take the All Blacks to the edge of the abyss, but restrained pride was trumped by an acute sense of angst.

This was not how the script was supposed to play out. This was not the mismatch widely predicted. It was a tight, tense, gruelling encounter and England were not behind until 10 minutes from the end.

They were weakened, written off and cast as mere cannon fodder, but they would not accept that a New Zealand victory was pre-ordained.

Instead, Lancaster’s scratch line-up — decimated by injuries and a personnel shortage caused by  fixture congestion — took the fight to the hosts and outplayed them in most areas.

Amid a multitude of exceptional individual performances No 8 Ben Morgan was a titanic figure, driving his side on to the front foot and deep into enemy territory, while Manu Tuilagi was the fulcrum of the  back-line threat as he resumed his wrecking-ball routine.

The Leicester centre repeatedly blasted gaping holes in the home defence and the fact that he was given the ammunition to do so was testament to the men who had been identified as potential weak links for the tourists.

Circumstances had brought Freddie Burns and Kyle Eastmond together as an untried 10-12 axis and the fear was that they would be exposed by the All Blacks.

That doomsday scenario did not come to pass, as the England pair held firm and caused far more  trouble than they were forced to endure.

Burns kicked all his penalties, pulled the strings with real authority and committed body and soul to tackling duties. Eastmond, meanwhile, was a revelation — displaying nifty footwork, a willingness to play flat to the line and a knack for  sending Tuilagi into space with beautifully delayed passes.

So many others stood out, too, from hooker Rob Webber — who made light of a lack of game-time in the last month to turn in a superb shift at hooker — to Geoff Parling and James Haskell.

At the forefront of the epic effort was Chris Robshaw, who led by stirring example and  eclipsed his legendary rival Richie McCaw. But the captain was not prepared to accept praise for himself and his team as any sort of compensation for a negative outcome.

‘We’re extremely proud of all the effort that’s gone in, to come here and do that, but we can’t be happy with it,’ said the Harlequins flanker. ‘The standards we set for each other now and the standards we play at; we’re coming down here to win a Test series, simple as that.

‘We genuinely thought we could win here. That’s the position we have got to with English rugby. But it’s one thing being in a good place and another thing winning.’

Robshaw’s reaction to this agonising defeat highlighted the fact that England do not harbour an inferiority complex against the world’s pre-eminent rugby nation — they are convinced that beating them is within their scope.

Asked what they have to do better in Dunedin next week, the skipper added: ‘We’ve just got to win, simple as that. We got ourselves in some good positions at times, but didn’t quite finish them off. They probably got on our line twice and took a chance. That’s the difference.’

When it was put to him that the All Blacks will be markedly better in six days, Robshaw said: ‘Yeah, but so will we. We know we’re going to get stronger every week, but we were pretty evenly matched out there.’

That, in fact, is understating the English performance. In so many ways, they held the aces until the heartbreaking finale, when Conrad Smith touched down in the right corner two minutes from time to ensure New Zealand preserved their 20-year unbeaten record at this venue.

Lancaster’s men made mistakes along the way, but they forced so many more from their opponents, whose rustiness was sometimes remarkable to behold. Rarely has an All Black team made so many basic handling errors.

Until the try at the end, the scoring had come down to a kicking duel, with Aaron Cruden’s five penalties matched by Burns’ four and one from his replacement, Danny Cipriani.

Both sides relied on precise, contestable, in-field kicks to build pressure, but England had the clear upper hand in the set-piece, with Webber and Parling orchestrating a lineout masterclass. In the final analysis, what counted against England was that they could not quite capitalise on three or four prime try-scoring opportunities.

Openings were created but the visitors were not clinical enough. Lancaster was asked if this was a missed chance to claim an historic victory and he said: ‘Yes, definitely. Now the game next week is huge for us because we want to tie the series and go to a decider in Hamilton believing we can win it.’

England will step up preparations for the Dunedin Test in the belief that they have nothing to fear from the world’s best team.

Several high-class reinforcements are on standby to return and should ensure that intensity levels rise, rather than drop off after this loss. This series is not over yet. Glorious failure need not become a habit.
