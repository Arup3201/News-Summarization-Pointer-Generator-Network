Beyonce, Cara Delevingne, Ellie Goulding and Rita Ora have many things in common: fame, fortune and fashion credentials.

They also share a love of an up-and-coming streetwear design duo who, until now, were an unknown brother and sister crafting clothes from their University bedrooms.

Meet Jaded London - the label set to take the nation's wardrobes by storm.

Jade and Grant Goulden founded Jaded London in the summer of 2013. Inspired by global street style from East London, LA and New York, the creators set about designing their own take on urban streetwear - and the A-listers can't get enough.

In the past month, Cara, Ellie, Rita and even Beyonce have been spotted sporting the sibling's designs, something they find hard to comprehend.

Speaking to FEMAIL about her overnight success, 25-year-old Jade said: 'I feel overwhelmed by the reaction the brand has had but it hasn’t quite sunk in yet especially when I see people walking down the street wearing Jaded London.'

Speaking about the history of the brand, which is now stocked in high street mecca Topshop, Jade said: 'We set up Jaded London in the Summer of 2013. After two successful years working at ASOS I decided to use the business skills I had learned, and my commercial eye, to take a big risk and start my own label.

Brains behind the brand: Grant and Jade Goulden, who come from a fashion obsessed family, started the brand last summer

'My family have worked in the fashion industry for three generations so I have grown up around the business and learnt the trade from my father.

'I saw the growth in the market for streetwear so decided to develop an exciting range for a young demographic. My brother Grant graduated university at the same time, he has a far better knowledge than me of men's fashion and trends so we decided to work together to develop a unisex brand.

'He looks after menswear, which is stocked in Topman and River Island and I look after womenswear sold in Topshop, Selfridges and Urban Outfitters; we have a great working relationship.'

Jade, who describes the range as 'premium streetwear', says she was inspired by the catwalk trend for sports luxe, which was seen everywhere from Christopher Kane to Ashish.

'We are developing a handwriting style where people can instantly recognise a Jaded London print,' she said.

'We don't just focus on streetwear, we also produce a lot of going out dresses and glam co-ords. Jaded is a reactive brand as we have a very quick supply chain so we continuously adapt to current trends.

'I think the sports luxe trend will stick around as even the big fashion houses like Chanel are using streetwear as a main focus to their fashion shows and collections.'

The young designers are already looking to branch out and have their sights set on launching swimwear and festival rain macs this summer and would one day love to develop a Jaded perfume or make-up range.

Famous fans: Ellie, who has been sporting a new signature style lately, is a huge fan of the brand, while Cara Delevingne has worn it too (right)

Ambitious Jade - who managed to get her range into Topshop simply by 'emailing the buying team not thinking I would have a response at such an early stage' - said of her celebrity fans: 'Beyonce actually bought the Diamond crop sweat and the Honeycomb skirt herself when Topshop shut down the store for her.

'Ellie Goulding also purchased the Violet Swirl tee when shopping in Urban Outfitters. It is crazy to think they are buying the product for themselves rather than under a stylist's influence.'

Jade, who would love to see Rihanna, Kayne West and Pharrel Williams wearing her designs, says you don't need to be an A-list to pull off her clothes, which are priced between £30-£65.

'We love seeing customers style the Jaded look themselves and posting pictures on Instagram. A lot of people are daring enough to wear the matching co-ords but others style with jeans and plainer tees,' she said.
