A former parliamentary secretary of George Galloway has been spared jail despite convincing her anti-terror police husband to illegally access emails for her.

Aisha Ali-Khan, 34, was given a 12-month conditional discharge after admitting that she had encouraged husband Mohammed Afiz Khan, 46, to obtain people's private details.

Ali-Khan, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, made the request in an attempt to identify individuals who had posted offensive material on the internet and sent her emails on or about August 24 2012.

Alish Ali-Khan, 34, was sentenced to a 12-month conditional discharge after admitting she convinced her police officer-husband, Mohammed Afiz Khan, 46, to illegally access emails and other personal data 

Sentencing her at London’s Southwark Crown Court today, the Recorder of Westminster Alastair McCreath said: 'I accept that your criminality arises in circumstances where you were offended, and justifiably so, by someone putting material on the internet that was offensive to you.

'The request was unlawful. Whilst what you did was against the law, the request was understandable and led to nothing.

'Punishment as such is inappropriate - you must behave yourself for the next 12 months when this will be discharged.'

Her husband was also sentenced today to six months in jail, suspended for two years, and charged £500 costs after he pleaded guilty to two charges of misconduct.

In December  he pleaded guilty to using his position in the Metropolitan Police to pass details of the arrest of radical Muslim cleric Anjem Choudary to his wife while she was employed by Mr Galloway on or around May 22, 2012.

He also admitted to obtaining CCTV from South Yorkshire Police between March 16 and April 30, 2012, which the court heard was 'for private purposes to do with jealousy and uncertainty about your relationship.'

Khan was sentenced to six months in jail suspended for two years and ordered to pay £500 costs after admitting two charges of misconduct. He has also been sacked from his job as an anti-terror officer

Khan was suspended by the Met Police in July last year after he was charged, and has now been sacked from the force. 

Speaking about the information on Choudary's arrest, the judge said: 'The object of Mr Khan to gain this information was to assist Ms Ali-Khan and that she might be able to bolster her position as Mr Galloway’s assistant.'

He added that the breach should cast no aspersions on Mr Galloway.

Caroline Haughey, defending Khan, told the court that Khan felt 'enormous shame' in having thrown away a 25-year career in a job that he 'worshipped'.

She said: 'He feels he has betrayed the Metropolitan Police Service, the police generally, the public, his family and the community by his stupidity.

'These offences were motivated by his heart rather than his head.'

Ms Haughey added that he felt 'great shame and sadness' that his father had died watching his downfall.

She said: 'There was no financial gain. He has lost his job, lost his pension and lost his self-respect. The only gain from it was to his own jealous mind. It was an ego trip by him and his partner.'
