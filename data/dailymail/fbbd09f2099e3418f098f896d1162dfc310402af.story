FBI agents raided the house of a reputed Connecticut mobster suspected of having information about the 1990 robbery of a Boston museum that remains the largest art heist in history.

More than 20 agents in haz-mat suits examined a car in the driveway, searched a wooded area and removed boxes of evidence from the ranch-style suburban home of 75-year-old Robert Gentile, who has been detained since February on federal drug and weapons charges.

During the heist of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, rare works from masters such as Rembrant, Degas, and Vermeer were stolen, sometimes cut from their frames.

The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case

During the 1990 robbery, thieves disguised as police officers struck as Boston finished celebrating St. Patrick's Day, binding two guards, before stealing masterworks by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas and Manet.

The stolen art is worth more than a half-billion dollars.

Despite a $5million ‘no questions asked’ reward by the museum, countless searches, and intense media coverage, no one has been charged in the heist.

A lawyer for Gentile, A. Ryan McGuigan, told the Associated Press that the FBI returned to his client's property in Manchester, just outside Hartford, because the agency had a new warrant allowing the use of ground-penetrating radar to look for buried weapons.

Mr McGuigan said he believes agents are really looking for stolen paintings but will find no such thing.

'This is nonsense,' he said. 'This is the FBI. Are you trying to tell me they missed something the first time? They're trying to find $500 million of stolen artwork... All they're going to find is night crawlers,’ though he later added that he believes authorities had recovered two weapons.

According to the Boston Globe, officials brought in some non-human helpers as well, using two beagles and a ferret to search for possible weapons.

One neighbour told the Globe that the elderly Gentile lives a quiet life with his wife. ‘They are very nice people, very quiet people,’ they said.

A federal prosecutor said in March the FBI believes Gentile had some involvement with stolen property related to the 1990 heist. 

Gentile has not been charged in the art robbery and Mr McGuigan says his client does not know anything about it.

A U.S. attorney's office spokesman declined to comment. A message left with an FBI spokesman was not immediately returned.

Gentile was arrested three months ago on a charge of selling illegally obtained prescription painkillers. Federal agents say they seized three revolvers, numerous rounds of ammunition and home-made silencers during a February 10 search of Gentile's home.

Gentile was arraigned last month on weapons charges. He leaned on a cane as he slowly rose before a judge in federal court in Hartford to plead not guilty to three charges.

Mr McGuigan called him an ‘old man in poor health,’ according to the Hartford Courant, and accused federal prosecutors of ‘poling’ charges on him in hopes of finding a lead in the missing artwork case.

His attorney says authorities first approached Gentile about the heist two years ago and, when he offered no information, they dispatched an undercover witness to buy prescription drugs from him.

The museum continues to offer a $5 million, no-questions-asked reward. Gentile's lawyer says that if he were some type of arch-criminal, he would have figured a way to get the reward money.

Prosecutors say Gentile is a member of a Philadelphia crime family. His lawyer denies the mob allegation.

However, Gentile was convicted of larceny in 1996. Convicted felons may not possess firearms or ammunition that have been transported across state lines or from overseas.

Federal law also prohibits possession of a silencer unless it's been registered.

Each of the three weapons charges carries a maximum prison term of 10 years and a fine of up to $250,000.

Authorities say FBI agents have had unproductive discussions with Gentile about the art theft.

The Courant reports that Gentile was deemed a threat to public safety by a federal judge, and will be held without bail while he waits for trial.
