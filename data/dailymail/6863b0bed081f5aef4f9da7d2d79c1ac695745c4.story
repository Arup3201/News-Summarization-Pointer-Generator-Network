Grandparents care for 1.6million children, giving a 'lifeline' to busy parents

The nation’s hard-working grandparents are saving families £7.3billion a year by taking over childcare, research has shown.

They are throwing busy parents a ‘lifeline’ by looking after grandchildren for increasingly long hours.

The findings, released by Grandparents Plus and Age UK, show the older generation care for 1.6million children, or 14.3 per cent of under-14s.

The total number of hours they are responsible for childcare has also increased from 1.3billion to 1.7billion – a 35 per cent rise.

As a result, the value of the work provided for free by grandparents in the UK now stands at £7.3billion, up from £3.9billion in 2004.

The charities analysed data from 
Understanding Society, the UK longitudinal survey which includes 
information on the childcare of over 11,000 boys and girls.

Caroline Abrahams, from Age UK, said: ‘Grandparents are such an important part of children’s lives.

‘They are, it would seem, playing an increasing role in providing an affordable way for parents to continue working.’

And Sam Smethers, chief executive of Grandparents Plus, said the Government should make it easier for grandparents to combine work and caring responsibilities.

He added: ‘Grandparents are throwing a lifeline to families squeezed by falling real incomes and rising childcare costs.

‘The contribution they are making within their families and the wider economy is enormous and rising.’

When a grandparent did provide childcare, they undertook about 20 hours a week on average. This equated to an annual average saving of over £8,600 for a family with two young children.

Younger grandmothers - aged 50 to 64 - who are fit, healthy and with younger grandchildren are the most likely to be providing the care to enable parents, particularly mothers, to work, according to the charities’ briefing paper.

The number of hours grandparents are responsible for childcare have increased by 35 per cent

It calls for changes in retirement and state pension ages to take account of the ‘vital’ role of grandparents in providing childcare, enabling parents to work.

Legislation should also make clear that grandparents are entitled to take emergency leave to provide care for grandchildren.

The document says: ‘The planned extension of the right to request flexible working to all has the potential to make it much easier for grandparents to combine work with informal care and to retain both mothers and grandparents in the labour force.

‘It will be important for employers to respond sympathetically to requests from grandmothers (and grandfathers), and public sector employers could show leadership on this.’

Mr Smethers added: ‘Research shows that grandparents providing childcare tend to be grandmothers who are younger, fitter and healthier, but no longer working.

‘They are the very women who are being expected to remain longer in work to pay for healthcare and pensions in older age.

‘The risk is of an emerging childcare gap as grandmothers stay in paid work and are no longer available to provide care, with mothers leaving the labour market as a result.’
