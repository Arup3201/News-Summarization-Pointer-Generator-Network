Schools are entering weaker GCSE pupils into more than one exam in the same subject to try and boost league table positions, the exams regulator revealed yesterday.

Teenagers are also being pushed into taking exams early so they can resit them to try and get a better grade.

Ofqual said the strategy was mainly used with children expected to get a C or a D in a subject. A grade C or higher is classed as a good pass.

It claimed the tactics were designed to allow schools to cherry pick the best results to skew the league tables.

The most startling example is in English language, where the number taking the predominantly exam-based International GCSE (IGCSE) has soared from 18,000 last year to 78,000 this year – more than a fourfold increase.

However, this rise is not mirrored by a comparable drop in the number taking the standard GCSE, which includes more coursework.

This suggests pupils are sitting both the GCSE and the IGCSE in an attempt to get a decent grade in one of them.

As pupils await their results this month, it also emerged that 45,000 sat IGCSE maths this year, up from 34,000 last year.

Ofqual said 15 per cent of students entered for GCSE maths last summer – around 90,000 – had ‘also sat one or more units from another maths GCSE or taken another whole maths GCSE’.

Warning: Ofqual chief executive Glenys Stacey said that where students are at risk of not getting a C grade, 'the tactic is to enter the student for more than one qualification and ride both horses to the end'

In addition to this tactic, there has also been a significant increase in children taking exams before 16.

Last year, 18 per cent took maths GCSE a year early. This year it was 23 per cent.

In English language it has leapt from 7 to 10 per cent, while the numbers taking English literature and language early have increased from 8 to 11 per cent.

Ofqual chief executive Glenys Stacey said: ‘This is more common for students at the C/D boundary. We are not suggesting this is happening with students of all abilities.

‘But where students are at risk of not getting that precious C grade then the tactic is to enter the student for more than one qualification and ride both horses to the end.

'In some cases we’re seeing, in maths, that students are riding two horses and moving to a third horse – a completely different one – halfway through.

‘There are questions being asked about the educational value of that and the cost. But the reasons are quite clear.’

Focus: Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, warned in June that teachers were putting too much emphasis on pupils at the C/D boundary at the expense of gifted students

Schools are able to ‘bank’ better results with the Department for Education when students sit more than one exam in the same subject, which lets them improve their standing in league tables.

Miss Stacey warned that pupils might be demotivated by the extra pressure and said having younger students sit exams might lower overall results.

'We will be critical of schools using early entry where we are not confident that this is allowing youngsters to achieve their full potential'

She also hinted that results could dip in science subjects after they were toughened up.

Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, warned in June that teachers were putting too much emphasis on pupils at the C/D boundary at the expense of gifted students.

More children should be put in sets because mixed-ability classes pitched at average students had led to tens of thousands missing out on top grades, he said.

Ofsted yesterday said it was aware of some schools using ‘early entry’.

A spokesman added: ‘As Sir Michael has said on previous occasions, in our inspection reports we will be critical of schools using early entry where we are not confident that this is allowing youngsters to achieve their full potential.’
