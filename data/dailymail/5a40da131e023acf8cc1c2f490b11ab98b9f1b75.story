Wayne Rooney has drawn level with Arsenal legend Thierry Henry as the Premier League's joint third highest goalscorer after the Manchester United captain netted in his side's emphatic 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers.

The Englishman scored in the 44th minute to add to his Premier League goal tally which now stands at 175 goals.

His strike ensured Louis van Gaal's side went into the interval with a healthy lead after Angel di Maria and Ander Herrera scored their first goals for their new club - before Juan Mata added a fourth in the second half to complete the rout.
