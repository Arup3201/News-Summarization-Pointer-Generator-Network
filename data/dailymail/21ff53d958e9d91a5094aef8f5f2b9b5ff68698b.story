Andy Murray is taking on the whole of Australia on Tuesday, although his local hero opponent actually has ambitions to become an Essex man.

Nick Kyrgios, carrying the hopes of a nation as he tackles Murray in the Australian Open quarter-final, is house-hunting around the Epping area as he plans the next step in his blossoming career.

Although his clash with Murray has been built up along the lines of the Ashes, the 19-year-old from Canberra has quite a few British connections which are likely to get stronger as he plans his career.

The heir apparent to the likes of Rod Laver, Pat Cash and Lleyton Hewitt knows that having a base outside Australia is essential, and Essex seems to fit the bill.

Known as ‘Wild Thing’ due to his animated on-court personality, which includes a tendency to swear and smash his rackets, there are some mixed feelings about Kyrgios in his home country, rather like there were with Cash and Hewitt.

‘He’s not won anything yet has he?’ harrumphed one veteran Australian Grand Slam champion, before adding that he nonetheless believed Kyrgios to be ‘the real deal’.

This ambivalence among some partly explains why Kyrgios has yet to play on the main Rod Laver Arena, the venue of the match against Murray starting at 8.15am UK time.

Imagine a British teenage sensation getting to the Wimbledon quarter-finals without having played on the Centre Court.

His absence from there has been partly because Australia’s tennis hierarchy do not want him to get too carried away with himself, and they have handed Murray a small advantage due to his familiarity with the arena.

It could be that, like Cash, Kyrgios finds himself being able to relax more in London, where he enjoyed his finest hour by beating Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon last year.

His associations include having a British manager and training occasionally at the Gosling Tennis Centre in Welwyn Garden City. He is also a Tottenham supporter and his sister Halimah, a singer and actress, has lived in Canary Wharf for several years.

The Australian media are somewhat divided on Kyrgios, admiring his extravagant shot-making and fighting instincts, but unsure what to make of his blingy persona, stripy haircut and emotional outbursts.

His manager John Morris knows him better than most, having signed him up to his company Global Tennis Connections as a 15-year-old.

‘Basically he is a great lad with a big heart,’ Morris said. ‘Of course he is still young and there has been a lot for him to handle in a short space of time.

‘The Sunday before the tournament started we were not even sure whether he was going to play due to back problems, so really he does not have much to lose against Andy — he can go out there and enjoy himself.’

Kyrgios, whose painter-decorator father is of Greek heritage and whose mother is originally from Malaysia, loves the big occasion and is a player you cannot take your eyes off.

During his five-set comeback win against Andreas Seppi on Sunday he spotted three fans sneaking out of the stadium and shouted: ‘Oi! Where are you going?’ He told another spectator making a surreptitious call: ‘Get off your f***ing phone!’

Kyrgios, who showed plenty of promise as a basketball player before concentrating on tennis, also shows his fondness for the big time in his results since emerging from the Challenger circuit to make such a splash at Wimbledon.

He made the quarter-finals at SW19 and the third round of the US Open before his run here, but strangely has won only one match on the regular ATP Tour apart from that.

It is still enough to have propelled him to what will be a minimum ranking of 35, regardless of how he fares against Murray — far ahead of any other teenager.

His natural power is something uncoachable and, going into the last eight he had hit 97 aces, more than any other player in the tournament. In Australia they also know that he is in the vanguard of a young generation who are set to revive the country’s proud tennis heritage, which for too many years has been over-reliant on the fading force of Hewitt.

Along with Kyrgios there is the mercurial Bernard Tomic and 18-year-old Thanasi Kokkinakis, with all three having genuine top-10 potential.

Murray sees something of his younger, more tempestuous self in today’s opponent and understands the pressures of performing at your home Grand Slam.

Provided Murray is able to reproduce the outstanding form he showed in dismissing Grigor Dimitrov from the fourth round, it will surely be enough to subdue the explosive power of the young Australian, and the huge support he will enjoy.
