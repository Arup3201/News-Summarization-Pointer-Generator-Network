Smiling for the cameras as make-up artists dab foundation on their noses, the models backstage at Ivanman show in Berlin could have stepped straight off the set of 2001 film Zoolander.

Others are pictured peeping out from beneath curling rags, while one shows off his best 'Blue Steel' while a beauty guru pats foundation into his cheekbones.

A third looks intently into the mirror as he smooths down his centre parting while a fourth keeps his eyes on the camera as a helper attacks his nose with a powder brush.

Do models get SPOTS? It would seem so but luckily this man has a make-up artist on hand to sort it out

All later appeared in the latest menswear collection from Serbian designer Ivan Mandzukic, which along with loosely tailored jackets in pastel pink and blush, also saw the return of the form-fitting roll neck which was worn Miami Vice style with a blazer on top.

But it wasn't all delicate shell pink and nude. Mandzukic injected a pop of bright colour into the palette courtesy of a series of cobalt blue ensembles, among them a beautifully tailored pair of shorts that even the most fashion illiterate of men could pull off.

Other highlights included chic tailored chinos with rolled hems and wearable short sleeved shirts in khaki linen and cerulean.

One of the hottest young designers on the German fashion scene, Mandzukic, who took the Net-A-Porter Who's Next award in the menswear category in 2012, has been at the helm of his own label since 2010 and boasts a degree in fashion styling from ESMOD.

But while Mandzukic's deft touch with tailoring and delicate use of colour won plaudits from the local fashionistas, he isn't the only hot young designer taking to the stage at Berlin Fashion Week today.

Also on the schedule on day two of the biannual fashion extravaganza were shows from Julian Zigerli, a menswear whizz specialising in quirky print, and Rebekka Ru√©tz, a 29-year-old streetwear star.

Later this week, Berlin will see shows from more established names, among them Copenhagen's David Andersen and Livia Firth favourite, eco-label Prophetik.
