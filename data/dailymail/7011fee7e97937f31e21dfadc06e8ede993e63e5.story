The Pentagon said on Thursday it would resume flights of its F-35 fighter jets following a week-long precautionary grounding imposed after a crack was found on an engine blade on a test plane in California.

'F-35 flight operations have been cleared to resume,' Pentagon spokeswoman Kyra Hawn said in a statement. She said flights could begin as early as Friday, depending on weather conditions.

No additional cracks were found during inspections of engines on the remaining 50 planes in the Pentagon's fleet, or any spare engines, Hawn said.

The order allowing flights to resume 
is good news for the $396 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the 
Pentagon's biggest weapons program which is bracing for big cutbacks 
when automatic across-the-board budget cuts take effect on Friday.

It comes two days after the 
Pentagon's F-35 program chief blasted engine maker Pratt & Whitney 
and prime contractor Lockheed Martin Corp for trying to 'squeeze every 
nickel' out of the Pentagon and not shouldering enough risk on the 
program.

The order ends the program's second 
engine-related flight ban in less than two months.

The Marines Corps 
version of the plane was grounded for nearly a month from mid-January 
because of a faulty hose in the engine, later blamed on manufacturing 
errors.

Matthew Bates, a spokesman for Pratt 
& Whitney, which supplies the engines for the planes, said the 
Pentagon's F-35 program office had decided to rescind the grounding 
order after extensive tests and analysis of the cracked turbine blade, 
which was discovered on February 19 during a routine inspection 
conducted after every 50 hours of flight time.

Bates said Pratt engineers had been 
working around the clock with Pentagon experts to determine the cause of
the crack in the engine blade, including a 'destructive' test that 
cracked open the blade.

The tests showed that the crack 
resulted from the 'unique operating environment' in flight tests -- many
of which tested the engine's powerful after burners -- rather than a 
high-cycle fatigue crack, which would have required a design change.

Bates said the engine in question had
operated at high temperatures for more than four times longer than a 
typical F-35 flight, which led to a separation of the 'grain boundary' 
of this particular blade.

The Navy order rescinding the flight 
ban, or so-called 'red stripe,' said that engine had experienced the 
most 'hot engine time exposure' of all the engines in the developmental 
program. It said it would now require reports to monitor and limit 
similar damage after every 25 flight hours.

Replacing: The F-35 is intended to replace older fighters like the Air Force F-16, pictured, and the Navy F/A-18 while hoping to purchase more than 2,400

Pratt recommended the resumption of 
flights and ground operations of the engine earlier on Thursday after 
its engineers ruled out a high-cycle fatigue crack.

The Pentagon said the investigation 
concluded that the 0.6-inch long crack was caused by 'prolonged exposure
to high levels of heat and other operational stressors.'

Pratt, a unit of United Technologies 
Corp, supplies the engine for the single-engine, single-seat fighter 
plane, which is built by Lockheed Martin Corp.
