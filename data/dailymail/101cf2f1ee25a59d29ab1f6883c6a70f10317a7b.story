Who am I? 'Debranded' products in the Selfridges' No Noise food department include Heinz ketchup

As one of London's most popular 
department stores, Selfridges is always packed with excitable shoppers 
looking to snap up a great purchase.

But now if the hustle and bustle of the central London shopping haunt gets too much for you, help is at hand.

Selfridges is to drop their name from the familiar yellow shopping bags, as well as some of its high-profile brands, in a post-Christmas campaign to help customers gain 'peace and tranquility'.

The department store's No Noise project centres around the re-launch of its Silence Room, first created by founder Harry Gordon Selfridge in 1909, to allow customers to 'take a moment to pause and switch off' and where they will be asked to leave shoes, phones and '21st century distractions' at the door.

The store will drop its name from its shopping bags until around the end of March, while brands removing their logos from products include Beats by Dr Dre, Creme de La Mer skincare, Levi's jeans and Marmite.

A curated 'Quiet Shop' offers 
customers a carefully selected range of products that encourage 
'considered purchasing' - from a capsule collection of unique, 
symbolically de-branded items, to everyday stationery and wardrobe 
staples - promoting a purer approach to design.

Alongside the exclusive, de-branded 
collection, the clothes have been hand-picked from
the Spring-Summer 2013 ready-to-wear by brands including Acne, Cos, 
Maison Martin Margiela and Jil Sander.

Acne have created exclusive pieces for No Noise, removing MUSIC and COLLAGE slogans from SS13 runway t-shirts.

There will also be a mass meditation event,  pods in which customers can listen to messages to promote a 'healthy mind' and a series of talks and workshops to induce inner calm, according to a spokesman.

Meanwhile, the store's food halls will promote 'simple, honest food'.

Selfridges creative director Alannah 
Weston said: 'Selfridges No Noise is a project which invites customers to
find a moment of peace in a world where we are bombarded by a cacophony
of information and stimulation.

'We
hope that people will enjoy the restorative qualities of quietness by 
visiting our Silence Room and by participating in a specially curated 
programme of quiet experiences.'

From tomorrow to the end of February,
No Noise at Selfridges urges customers to proactively seek out moments 
of peace and tranquility through their multi-layered initiative.

The new 'Silence Room' presents a fresh take on the original model but with the same purpose: providing an oasis of quiet.

Visitors will be asked to leave shoes, mobile phones and '21st century distractions' at the door.

Another
key feature of No Noise at Selfridges is an exclusive partnership with
Headspace, revolutionary mavericks whose approach to meditating and applying the 
discipline to everyday life is revolutionary.

Headspace
pods in the Selfridges stores will deliver their mindful messages and 
meditation practice, and interactive Headspace content will also be 
available on www.getsomeheadspace.com

Andy
Puddicombe, Co-Founder of Headspace, said: 'Headspace is really excited
to be partnering with Selfridges for No Noise.

'This is an opportunity 
for the general public to experience the benefits of meditation in a 
very direct and tangible way, in a truly unique environment.

Guess who: From Marmite to Heinz baked beans Beats, many recgnisable brands have jumped on board

'At the same
time, it helps us here at Headspace to achieve our global mission of 
improving the health and happiness of the world, whilst having fun with 
something which is often seen as a bit too serious.'

Other No Noise initiatives include a special collaboration with Scottish conceptual artist Katie Paterson who will create four special windows for Selfridges ahead of taking part in the Hayward Gallery's first major show of the year, Light Show.

There is a further link with the Hayward Gallery courtesy of Nadine Monem, the gallery's Art Publisher, who will curate a book shelf featuring tomes reflective of No Noise's aesthetic, ethics and sensibility.

To nurture the body as well as the 
soul, No Noise will also take a closer look at how better food can 
foster better mental well-being with Food For Thought at Selfridges.

The
Food Halls in the Oxford St and Trafford stores will showcase 
initiatives to promote clean, simple, honest food from the best 
suppliers, most of them British – from the Juice Club operated by a new 
outfit led by world-class mixologist Dan Thompson, to a nutrition clinic
headed up by Julie Neville, nutritionist and wife of footballer Phil 
Neville who will be bringing her Win Naturally bespoke approach to 
healthy eating to Selfridges.
