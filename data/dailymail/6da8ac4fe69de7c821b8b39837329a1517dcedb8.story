In the not-so-distant future, we could be implanted with devices that seek out infection before dissolving naturally into our bloodstream.

Researchers in Illinois have created biodegradable batteries that travel through the body capable of wirelessly transmitting data to doctors.

They are made from a combination of metals and cathodes which gradually melt over the course of three weeks, without releasing any harmful chemicals.

The implantable battery, pictured, is made of magnesium foil and cathodes of iron, tungsten or molybdenum. Small doses of these elements dissolve in the body without causing health problems, and the device produces a safe electrical current to send vital sign data wirelessly

The batteries use anodes of magnesium foil with cathodes of iron, molybdenum or tungsten.

These elements dissolve slowly in the human body and, when implanted
 in small doses, do not cause any additional health problems.

The
 electrodes are joined together by a saline solution and the battery is 
coated in a biodegradable polymer known as a polyanhydride.

A square-centimetre cell with a 50-micrometre-thick 
magnesium anode and an 8-micrometre-thick molybdenum cathode creates 2.4
 milliamps of current. 

Cells that produce around 1.6 volts are capable of generating a radio signal, for example.

The batteries were developed by John Rogers and his team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

Rogers said the devices could be used to track temperature, monitor tissue development and even administer certain medical treatments and drugs.

They will also submit this data wirelessly to doctors, for example.

Speaking to Advanced Materials, Rogers said the batteries use anodes of magnesium foil with cathodes of iron, molybdenum or tungsten.

These elements dissolve slowly in the human body and, when implanted in small doses, do not cause any additional health problems.

The electrodes are joined together by a saline solution and the battery is coated in a biodegradable polymer known as a polyanhydride.

During tests, the batteries were placed in water and dissolved within three weeks.

Rogers told Nature that a square-centimetre cell with a 50-micrometre-thick magnesium anode and an 8-micrometre-thick molybdenum cathode creates 2.4 milliamps of current. 

The current and output varies depending on the cathodes used and the size of the cell, but cells that produce around 1.6 volts are capable of generating a radio signal, for example.

During tests, a battery, pictured left and right, was placed in water and dissolved completely within three weeks. The electrodes inside the batteries are joined together by a saline solution and the device is coated in a biodegradable polymer known as a polyanhydride

The battery in its final stages of dissolution. Researchers said the devices could be used to track temperature, monitor tissue development and administer drugs. They submit data wirelessly and the power will last for around a day

Rogers continued the power will last for around a day, and further research will be carried out to extend this time period by increasing the surface area of the magnesium foil.

The breakthrough builds on the work Rogers and this team carried out in 2012.

Two years ago they designed a biodegradable silicon chip that monitors temperature and can be used to prevent infection. These chips, however, used coils and power from an external source.

Elsewhere, Carnegie Mellon University recently designed an edible sodium-ion battery with melanin pigment electrodes, but these don’t last as long as magnesium-based devices.
