It may rank among the world's greatest and most widely used inventions but one in seven of us admit to hating the internet and fear it is 'taking control of our lives'.

Despite increasing numbers of Britons going online every day, a new survey has found many are concerned about privacy and only use the internet because they have to.

Growing numbers of people are concerned about access to internet pornography and the prevalence of cyber-bullying among youngsters.

The numbers of users supporting government regulation of what children can view online has also increased, according to the Oxford Internet Institute study.

In 2011, two thirds of those questioned said there was a role for Government in controlling what children can view online. But in the latest survey that had grown to three in four people.

In June, David Cameron announced plans to order Google and other internet providers to ban child pornography from the internet.

He said the Tia Sharp and April Jones murder cases, where their killers had viewed violent child pornography online, had swung public opinion in favour of stronger regulation.

The 2013 survey, released today, found eight out of ten people in Britain say they rely on the internet for everyday activities. It is an increase from six out of ten people a decade ago.

The study by the Oxford Internet Institute found more pensioners and disabled people are going online

However, despite the growing numbers 40 per cent of those asked said they had to use the internet but had little enthusiasm for it.

Dr Grant Blank, from the institute, told The Daily Telegraph: 'While most of us in Britain are now using the internet, half do it with little enthusiasm.'

The study of 2,000 people found more pensioners and disabled people are using the internet.

For the first time the majority of middle aged people say they use social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook.

Increasing numbers of people are also going online for basic everyday tasks such as shopping, banking or booking holidays.

The institute releases a report every two years on the changing ways people use the internet and looks at attitudes to regulation and control, social networking and access.
