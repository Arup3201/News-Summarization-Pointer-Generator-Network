A woman with terminal cancer who was beaten up by a mugger who was after her handbag has allowed police to release a photo of her injuries to try and track down the attacker.

The pictures show 63-year-old Marilyn Massie with painful cuts and bruises across her nose, mouth and forehead after the attack on Sunday near her home in Ashington, Northumberland.

The thief attacked Mrs Massie from behind as she was walking along Chestnut Avenue at around 11pm, according to police.

Assault: Marilyn Massie hopes this shocking picture of the injuries she sustained will help police track down the man who beat her up and stole her handbag

He beat her up, breaking her nose and wrist, before he made off on a bike with her handbag.

It contained a small amount of cash in a red purse and a mobile phone. 

The victim, who lives locally, was treated at Wansbeck District Hospital and given stitches before she was discharged.

The thief was in his late teens or early 20s, with dark hair and a slim build.

Detective Sergeant Tracey Moore said: 'This was a callous and cowardly attack on a vulnerable woman.

'We are determined to bring her attacker to justice and I hope that anyone with information about the robbery will do the right thing and pick up the phone.'

Injuries: The 63-year-old victim, who is suffering from terminal cancer, was treated for a broken wrist and nose and given stitches at Wansbeck Hospital

The handbag is mink coloured and suede textured with double shoulder straps and a brass clasp.

Anyone with information about the robbery is asked to contact police on the 101 non-emergency number. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers in confidence on 0800 555 111.
