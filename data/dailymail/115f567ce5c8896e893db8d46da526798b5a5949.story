It's no secret that Tim Tebow’s favourite Bible passage is John 3:16, but his performance Sunday took those numbers to biblical proportions.

The rookie quarterback, in the first playoff game of his career, threw for 316 total yards and averaged an impressive 31.6 yards per pass.

In addition, the overtime portion of the game, in which Tebow threw the game-winning 80-yard pass, scored a 31.6 television rating.

For your eyes only: Tim Tebow famously donned 'John 3:16' eye black when he led the University of Florida Gators to a win over the Oklahoma Sooners in the 2009 BCS National Championship quarterback Tim Tebow

During Tebow's college days with the University of Florida Gators, he wore eye black branded with different bible verses.

In the 2009 BCS National Championship, which he famously led the Gators to victory over the Oklahoma Sooners, the message on his eye black was 'John 3:16'.

After his graduation, messages on eye black were outlawed for college football players in a ban now known as 'the Tebow rule'.

In the NFL, such a practice is also against the rules.

The passage reads: 'For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.'

Since breaking into the NFL's top ranks this season, Tim Tebow has made headlines as much for his outspoken religious beliefs as for his performances for the Denver Broncos.

And his claims to be helped by God were bolstered when sharp-eyed fans saw a halo floating above the stadium where he helped the Broncos to a spectacular overtime victory over the Steelers on Sunday.

The ring of smoke appeared over the Mile High Stadium in Denver just after the Broncos scored their first field goal in the wild-card game which they won 29-23.

The game ended after the first play of overtime - just 11 seconds in - when the quarterback launched the incredible pass for a touchdown.

Tebow's amazing performance in the game cemented the 24-year-old's cult status - and the appearance of the halo in the sky above suggested his non-stop invocation of his religion may not have been in vain.

The divine apparition was snapped by Mark Neuman-Lee, who told the Huffington Post he'd never seen the phenomenon in the area before.

Two season-ticket holders at the stadium said they too thought the vision was unprecedented.

It was not the only divine coincidence surrounding the match, however.

Many commentators noticed that Tebow threw a total of 316 yards, evoking memories of the Bible verse John 3:16, which Tebow wrote on his eye paint when he was playing for the Florida Gators and which surged to the top of Google rankings after his appearance in the 2009 BCS Championship Game.

Tebow's success with the Broncos is considered by some to be particularly miraculous as he has masterminded an unusual number of victories from a losing position.

Apart from his sporting heroics, Tebow is best known for inspiring an internet craze named after him.Tebowing - kneeling down to pray in an incongruous or humorous situation - derives from the footballer's pious habit of praying in the middle of the pitch.

And recently a driver was spotted who took very direct inspiration from Tebow, adorning his car with the numberplate 'WWTD15' - or 'What would Tebow do?', followed by his jersey number.
