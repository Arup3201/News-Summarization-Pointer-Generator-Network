A schoolboy hanged himself in woods near his school after becoming a big fan of heavy metal music, an inquest heard today.

James Lock, 15, was found dead with his iPod earphones still in his ears playing the loud music.

His parents had noticed his new found love of 'hardcore' rock music in the year before his death - and had discovered 'dark' sketches he had done in his room.

But James, a good student who dreamed of becoming a pilot, had also drawn 'disturbing pictures' of people with a noose around their neck which were only found after his death.

The inquest heard that his mother Sarah, 42, had watched the teenager leave for school on April 10 with his earphones plugged in 'just like any ordinary day'.

But an hour later he was found by a university student who was walking through Hendrefoilan Woods in Skettya near Olchfa Comprehensive School in Swansea, South Wales, where James was a pupil.

Paramedics arrived at 9.35am to find the music still playing in his ears but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

The inquest heard James had recently become a fan of the masked rockers known for their disturbing lyrics and dark imagery

James had recently become a fan of the masked rockers known for their disturbing lyrics and dark imagery - with songs linked to violent crime. 

His heartbroken parents said they had known about their son's  interest in thrash metal and that he had sketched 'dark drawings' but they did not think it reflected his feelings.

His mother Sarah told police: 'James enjoyed listening to music. He had liked laid back music but recently he had got into darker and harder metal like Slipknot and had dark drawings in his bedroom.

'He loved his iPod and would often have earphones in.'

She said her son had a 'volatile personality and was quick tempered' and would often act without thinking of the consequences of his actions.

His father Andrew Lock said James would often have drawings on his arms depicting images such as 'falling angels'.

He said: 'In recent years he had been heavily into hardcore rock. We put the dark drawings down to the music scene he was into and didn't put them down to the way he was feeling.'

Divorcee Mr Lock continued: 'James had so much to look forward to in life and so many people who loved him and we feel devastated. We cannot think why he would take his own life.'

The inquest heard James had been an active pupil who dreamed of becoming a pilot before becoming 'heavily interested' in the thrash metal heroes Slipknot.

Detective Constable Laura O'Sullivan told the inquest: 'James starred in the school productions of Joseph and Greece.

'He had ambitions to join the forces and become an RAF pilot. He joined the Sea Cadets and took great pride in his uniform.

'He had won awards for best dress, drill team and won a gold at the national kayak championships.'

Tributes to the schoolboy were left attached to trees in Hendrefoilan Woods, in Sketty, last April after his death

Coroner Colin Phillips recorded a narrative verdict and said he could not be sure James intended to end his own life

The inquest heard there was no evidence of bullying of James, no drugs or alcohol involved.

Coroner Colin Phillips recorded a narrative verdict and said he could not be sure James intended to end his own life.

Mr Phillips said: 'Drawings and images were found and these were of a dark nature but I think these reflected his music interests and do not show any way he was feeling.

'James was only 15 years old and I am not convinced he understood the finality of his actions.

'He was found with his earphones in playing music and we have heard his mother say he would often act without thinking about the consequences of his actions.

 'This is a terrible tragic death of a young man who had so much to offer.'  

 

An earlier version of this story stated that James Lock was listening to Slipknot at the time of his death. We are happy to clarify that this was not the case.
