Britain was facing a new multi-billion-pound bill to prop up the euro last night as the single currency teetered on the brink of collapse.

Efforts by France and Germany to thrash out a rescue deal descended into chaos as a meeting of EU finance ministers scheduled for today was cancelled at the 11th hour because of lack of progress.

More than £18billion was wiped off the value of shares in London in just 20 minutes when EU officials also warned that a separate make-or-break leaders’ summit today in Brussels would also fail to end the crisis.

Today Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that the amount of money available for a bail-out needed to increase to prevent the collapse of Greece's economy and further damage to the eurozone.

Merkel said she sees no 'better alternative' to the efforts being made to protect the euro and added: 'If the euro fails, Europe fails.'

David Cameron will tell the leaders' summit today that a bigger bailout fund, help for banks and support for Greece is necessary to avoid economic catastrophe

The International Monetary Fund, to which Britain is a major contributor, made clear it is prepared to step in and boost the eurozone bailout fund.

That would leave British taxpayers to carry the can for those countries in the eurozone which have failed to solve their problems.

George Osborne said IMF funds should not be a substitute for a 'big bazooka' deal by those in the single currency to get their own house in order

Tory MPs warned that any attempt to increase Britain’s contribution would trigger a mutiny to make Monday’s rebellion on Europe, in which 81 defied the Prime Minister, look like ‘a children’s tea party’. Chancellor George Osborne has said IMF funds should not be a substitute for a ‘big bazooka’ deal by those in the single currency to get their own house in order.

Britain has already forked out around £12billion to bail out Ireland, Greece and Portugal through the IMF, the EU and in direct loans.

In Downing Street and the Treasury there was fury at the failure of Britain’s European partners to get their act together.

David Cameron will tell the leaders’ summit today that a bigger bailout fund, help for banks and support for Greece is necessary to avoid economic catastrophe.

A senior Whitehall source said yesterday:
 ‘At some point they need to get around a table and sort this out. There
 is still quite a lot to do. To say it is a mess would be a good 
description of where we are.’

To add to the chaos, Silvio Berlusconi’s
 Italian government had looked to be on the brink of collapse yesterday,
 after his coalition partners initially refused to make the cuts in 
spending they had been told were necessary to prevent Europe’s fourth 
largest economy going belly up.

A deal was eventually struck late last night, although there was scepticism over whether it would be sufficient to stave off further trouble.

British diplomats warned it could take weeks to finalise plans to bolster the firepower of the £383billion eurozone rescue fund to £870billion – the amount experts say is needed to ensure the survival of the single currency if Italy, Greece, Portugal and Ireland default on their debts.

Former chancellor Norman Lamont warned today of 'great dangers' with the possibility of a 'haircut' - a cut in value of a debt - for Greece.

Lord Lamont told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'There's a very important aspect of this and that is something called credit default swaps - the insurance policies that are taken out to safeguard people, insure people, against default by sovereign authorities like Greece.

'One of the dangers of the haircut that is being proposed is that a severe haircut will cause a credit event and will trigger credit default swaps and will therefore affect banks who hold those credit default swaps.

'That is one of the great dangers.'

He added: 'I think the market has got very definite expectations about the haircut, the amount of money required to recapitalise the banks, and they are very focused on the amount of money for the bailout fund.'

Lord Lamont also claimed some countries would fail to ever become 'fully competitive' in the future.

He said: 'I hope that they will manage to satisfy the markets and buy some time.

'I personally think the long-term future of the euro will be argued about for some time to come because the strains there are so immense I don't believe that the southern Mediterranean countries in the long run can ever really become fully competitive.'

British taxpayers could be hit indirectly, as eurozone officials indicated that the IMF could host a new fund to extend loans to governments at risk. Britain will have to pay 4.5 per cent of any IMF contribution.

‘The IMF has indicated that they are considering it,’ one eurozone official said. ‘The IMF is a possibility – they could be one of the investors, they could be the host of this fund.’

Talks on the plan are now under way between the eurozone and the IMF’s French chief Christine Lagarde.

Treasury officials said they would fight any IMF involvement if it let Germany, France and the other members of the single currency off the hook. One said: ‘There should be adequate resources for the bailout fund but IMF loans  shouldn’t be a substitute for action from the eurozone.’

Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘It’s totally unacceptable. It’s going to be no good  the Government bragging that we’re not contributing to a euro bailout when we are going to be contributing by the back door through the IMF.

‘If George Osborne comes to the Commons to increase Britain’s contribution to the IMF, it will make Monday’s night’s rebellion look like a children’s tea party.

‘We didn’t join the euro because we knew it would be a disaster. There’s no way the British taxpayer should be bailing them out. They should get their own house in order.’

David Cameron is due in Brussels today for a summit of all 27 EU leaders before a meeting of only eurozone leaders, at which an outline solution may be thrashed out.

But the cancellation of the finance ministers’ meeting means there is no prospect at all of completing the detailed number-crunching necessary to calm the markets.

The FTSE 100 index rose as high as 5548 in early trading in London yesterday but crashed as low as 5466 after the finance ministers’ meeting was cancelled.

Nearly 70 points – or around £18billion – was lost in a matter of minutes before the FTSE clawed back some of the rout to close down 22.52 at 5525.54.

Shares across Europe and in the United States were also on the slide.

Will Hedden, a trader at IG Index in London, said the cancellation of the finance ministers’ meeting ‘sent shivers through world markets’.

The Bank of England yesterday dismissed chaotic efforts to save the eurozone from financial meltdown as a temporary solution to the region’s woes.

Governor Sir Mervyn King said long-term issues such as towering levels of debt and structurally weak economies still needed to be tackled.

‘The aim of the measures to be introduced over the next few days is to create a year or possibly two years’ breathing space,’ he said. ‘The underlying problems still have to be resolved.’

It came as a grand plan to solve the escalating debt crisis was thrown into doubt after today’s meeting of European finance ministers was cancelled.

The ruling coalition in Italy, led by Silvio Berlusconi, also appeared to be in danger of collapse as it struggles to cut its debts and boost economic growth.

European leaders including British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will still meet in Brussels.

But the postponement of the finance ministers summit – due to be attended by George Osborne – suggested that a ‘big bazooka’ deal remains elusive.

King said the crisis in the eurozone, and slowdown in the global economy, was deeply damaging to the UK economy and its efforts to rebalance away from debt-fuelled domestic spending to exports and investment.

‘The international picture is highly relevant because going through a rebalancing, we are not looking to domestic consumption to try for a recovery, we are looking at exports,’ King told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee.

‘And the world economy had actually become quite encouraging, then the situation changed.’ The euro and stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic dived on fears that plans to save the single area bloc from catastrophe will unravel.

Leaders are at loggerheads over two key elements of the plan –reducing Greece’s massive debts to save it from collapse and boosting the firepower of the bailout fund.

‘It is a real mess once again,’ said a euro official.

Europe has broadly agreed that the weakest banks in the region need to raise nearly £100bn of extra funds to shield them from the crisis.

But negotiations to increase the size of the £383bn war chest designed to protect countries like Italy and Spain from a Greek-style meltdown are in the balance.

Banks and other private investors are also resisting plans to increase their losses – or the ‘haircut’ – on Greek debt from 21pc to as much as 60pc
