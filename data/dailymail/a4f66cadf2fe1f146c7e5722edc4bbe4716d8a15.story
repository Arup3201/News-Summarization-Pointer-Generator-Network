Its chimes counting down to each New Year are famous the world over.

Now Big Ben will mark the date in another way – by appearing on a limited edition £100 coin.

The coin, of which only 50,000 will be made, was unveiled by the Royal Mint yesterday and is Britain's first £100 coin. 

It is also the first time the Royal Mint has brought out a coin specifically for New Year.

The coin, which is 40mm wide and contains 2oz of silver,  is expected to prove popular in Britain

The iconic clock tower of the Houses of Parliament in London – officially called the Elizabeth Tower, with Big Ben the nickname for the bell inside – is pictured from street level to show it at its most familiar angle to visitors. 

And like regular coins, it features the Queen's head on the other side.

Shane Bissett, the Royal Mint's director of commemorative coin, bullion and medals, said: 'The sound of Big Ben chiming in the Elizabeth Tower is one that will have become synonymous with Britain for millions of British citizens and tourists alike, particularly on New Year's Eve when the world listens for Big Ben, which marks Greenwich Mean Time, to chime in the New Year.

'So it is a fitting choice for the nation's first £100 coin, and this is a fitting time for us to reveal it.'

The coin, which is 40mm (1.6in) wide and contains 2oz of silver, is expected to prove popular after the sell-out success of the first £20 coin, which was struck in honour of the birth of Prince George.

'It is building on 'British fever' following the Olympics in 2012 and the birth of Prince George,' a spokesman said yesterday.

The Royal Mint applied 60 tonnes of 'linear force' or pressure to imprint the iconic tower, the Queen's portrait and words 

Engraver Glyn Davies was inspired to portray Big Ben from the viewpoint of people who stare up at it each day

The special £200 coin provides a clear shot that few tourists can capture with their cameras 

The Royal Mint's engraver Glyn Davies was inspired to portray Big Ben from the viewpoint of the thousands who stare up at it each day.

But the coin provides a clear shot that few tourists can capture with their cameras. 

'It's never possible to get an uninterrupted view of the clock tower without it being obscured in some way by the weather, other tourists or even its own location,' Mr Davies explained yesterday.

While the coins are legal tender, they will not be in circulation for everyday use and are designed as collector items only.

They can be purchased exclusively from The Royal Mint's website: www.royalmint.com
