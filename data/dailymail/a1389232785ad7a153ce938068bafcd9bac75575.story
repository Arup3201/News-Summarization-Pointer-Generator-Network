Bigamy: David Jin Lee, 26, of Williamsburg, is married to a Norfolk-based sailor and another woman, with whom he has a child, in Fairfax

A Virginia man with two wives in different parts of the state has been arrested after he posed as a CIA agent in a bid to hide his elaborate double life from the young women.

David Jin Lee, 26, of Williamsburg, is married to a Norfolk-based sailor and another woman, with whom he has a child, in Fairfax.

After he asked the sailor to send him $2,000 claiming he had been captured and tortured by North Korean agents on a CIA mission to China she became suspicious and the Naval Criminal Investigation Service began to unraveled the plot.

Investigators quickly learned Jin Lee was not in the CIA and had been staying at a home in Fairfax.

Agents and City of Fairfax police searched the home and interviewed the woman who lives there with her father.

She said she was Jin Lee's wife and the mother of his child. A marriage certificate at the Fairfax County Courthouse confirmed the union.

'That means bigamy here in Virginia, and it's a serious offense,' City of Fairfax police Lt. Craig Buckley told NBC News. 'It's a Class 4 felony.'

NCIS investigators found a CIA coin, a gun and items that could have been used to make fake CIA badges from the Fairfax home.

'They did find a laminating machine and several laminating materials that could have been used to manufacture those identification cards, so that was certainly of use,' Buckley said.

Jin Lee was arrested in Williamsburg.

Both women were shocked at the discovery and police said they consider each of them and their families victims.

'It's not every day that someone will go to these lengths to perpetrate such a fraud or a con against someone, and it seems to be, at least on the surface, pretty sophisticated and has been able to, unfortunately, dupe two young ladies into his fraud,' Buckley said.

James City Police arrested Jin Lee on Wednesday and charged him with forgery of a public document. He is also reportedly charged with bigamy and uttering a forged public document.

Jin Lee is being held at the Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail.
