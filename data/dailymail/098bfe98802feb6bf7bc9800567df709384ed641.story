Liverpool have never conceded a goal to Real Madrid in three previous meetings but can they possibly extend that sequence to a fourth game?

It is a question Brendan Rodgers will be asking himself over and over again in the countdown to kick-off at Anfield, as not many people will give them a chance of preventing Madrid's all-stars going on a rampage for 90 minutes.

All numbers and logic point to Carlo Ancelotti's men picking off Liverpool at will. Real arrive on Merseyside on the back of seven consecutive victories, amassing 32 goals in the process. In four of those games, they have scored five times and plundered eight against Deportivo La Coruna on September 20.

So how will Liverpool, who have looked so frail as a defensive unit and conceded cheaply regularly during this erratic campaign, keep them out? If Rodgers has learnt anything from his side's Champions League adventure so far, it is that mistakes are ruthlessly punished.

Rodgers is a coach who likes his teams to play with flair and imagination but, on Wednesday, he will know the first thing that Liverpool have to be is difficult to beat: they need to play with intensity, relentless energy to take Madrid out of their comfort zone. No passengers can be permitted.

This, then, would be Sportmail's line-up: (4-2-3-1) Simon Mignolet; Glen Johnson, Dejan Lovren, Martin Skrtel, Alberto Moreno; Steven Gerrard, Joe Allen; Jordan Henderson, Philippe Coutinho, Adam Lallana; Raheem Sterling.

The big call would be taking Mario Balotelli out of the starting line-up but he has not shown any glimpse of having blistering pace during his time at Liverpool so far. He won't hang on the shoulders of Sergio Ramos and company or set the tone like Luis Suarez did.

Sterling, meanwhile, has often given the impression that he could be a devastating striker. Playing him in that role would also give Rodgers the option of dropping him back to help shore up the midfield if Real began to dominate possession.

Liverpool have won all three previous meetings with Real Madrid. 

 Liverpool 4-0 Real Madrid (March 10, 2009, Champions League)

Real Madrid 0-1 Liverpool (February 25, 2009, Champions League)

Liverpool 1-0 Real Madrid (May 27, 1981, European Cup final)

Midfield will be the crucial area, as if Toni Kroos and Luka Modric get on the ball, they will begin supplying the ammunition to James Rodriguez, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema. By packing the engine room, with runners and workers, Liverpool have a better chance of disrupting Real.

Liverpool are never better than when they when push their opponents back and press them high up the pitch. Henderson, Gerrard, Coutinho, Allen and Lallana are all capable of executing that game plan but those five also give Rodgers flexibility, allowing him to switch formations when necessary.

More than anything, though, Liverpool need to do the basics right. It might seem an obvious thing to say but they have been vulnerable this season to balls lofted into the area – think of the goals they gifted to West Ham and Queens Park Rangers.

Should Liverpool be as generous to Madrid as they have been to others so far, their Champions League ambitions will be in grave danger. It is why Rodgers must find the perfect formula to keep the reigning champions at bay.
