Daniel Sturridge put England’s disappointing World Cup campaign behind him by rubbing shoulders with some of music’s biggest names at an awards ceremony in California on Sunday.

The striker made a surprise appearance at the BET Awards in Los Angeles, to present the Best Male R&B/Pop Artist award alongside NFL star DeSean Jackson and actor Boris Kodjoe.

Another Premier League star was also in attendance at the Nokia Live Theatre, as Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri and his girlfriend Anara Atanes continued their holiday in LA.

Liverpool forward Sturridge, who struggled to get his line out, just about managed to avoid a spectacular own goal when he said: 'DeSean, we've been kicking football around internationally for years baby boy. You know we invented the game, that's how it goes.’

When he and Jackson started to mock squabble Boris cut them both down to size, saying, 'Fellas relax OK, international football, American football, you both play with balls.'

Sturridge will start pre-season training 
with Liverpool next month, though club team-mate Luis Suarez will not be
 joining him after being handed a four-month ban for biting Italy 
defender Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay’s group stage win.
