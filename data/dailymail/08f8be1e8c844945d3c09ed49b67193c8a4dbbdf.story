Natarsha Belling has put on a brave face before presenting doomed breakfast programme Wake Up for the last time.

The host of the axed show was spotted on Thursday looking tense and emotional after shooting the second last episode earlier in the day.

But Belling is not the only one feeling the pain, with staff who have been told their jobs have been axed as part of Channel Ten’s cut backs being forced to come to work and sit at their desks with nothing to do while decisions are made over whether they have new roles within the ailing TV network.

Taking its toll: News of Wake Up's axing the day before appears to have had an affect on host Natarsha Belling, who was spotted looking upset with her arms crossed as she walked on a busy footpath in Sydney's eastern suburbs on Thursday

An insider revealed to the Mail Online as the company looks at whether positions can be found for the team on the now defunct Wake Up, which was dumped after just six months on air, the staff are still being made to come into the building every day for the next two weeks.

Although they no longer have arrive at 3am – the usual start time for breakfast TV crew, they are being expected to put in a full working day. However with the show now canned, they are left twiddling their thumbs waiting to find out if they are one of the lucky few to be offered a new job.

The insider said: 'The atmosphere is pretty bad. Everyone is very down and as you can imagine the last thing they want to do is come into an office and sit at a desk when they have absolutely nothing to do.

'They are trying to put a brave face on things but it’s very tough. It’s not a great place to be right now.'

A day earlier Channel Ten confirmed it was axing Wake Up as well as its early, morning and late news bulletins and cutting up to 150 jobs

With the impact taking its toll on the presenter, she was seen with her arms crossed while walking on a busy footpath in Sydney's eastern suburbs - and with the pain of the past 24 hours written all over her face.

The 38-year-old was also later spotted walking with a mobile phone in her hand as she clutched onto a pen and piece of paper.

Another image shows Belling clenching her hands tightly as she walked, and with her thoughts appearing to be elsewhere.

The host's demeanor was in stark contrast to the brave face she put the night before at the InStyle and Audi Women Of Style Awards on Wednesday evening, following news of the axing earlier that day.

Wake Up will air for the last time this morning, with Belling and co-host James Mathison presenting what is expected to be sombre and emotional final episode.

Despite Belling learning on Wednesday that Wake Up was due to get the chop, the presenter said she spent the afternoon after the announcement 'eating ice cream' with her sons Harrison and Hugo.

'It's a really sad day for Network 10,' she told the Daily Telegraph. 'I'm heartbroken but I have no regrets because I have put in 110 per cent since day one and you cannot control circumstances that are out of your control.'

Natasha Exelby, Natarsha Belling, and James Mathison, were the original co-hosts of Wake Up, which will cease production on Friday

Studio 10's Jessica Rowe also attended the awards on Wednesday night and said she felt sadness for her colleagues at the axed breakfast show.

The television presenter said she felt guilty for being dressed up and attending the event, given the grim situation many of her co-workers were facing.

'It's awful, it is awful,' Rowe said of the announcement yesterday that Channel Ten would be axing Wake Up, as well as its early, morning and late news bulletins and cutting up to 150 jobs.

'In a way it kind of feels odd being here all frocked up and smiling when for a lot of people it's bloody awful and it is really sad,' she told The Daily Telegraph.

Ms Rowe is one of the hosts of Studio 10, which will remain on air, but she said despite the fact their show had been saved they were not 'happy'.

'Having in the past been through times when I have lost my job, it is not great.'

Jessica Rowe said it felt 'odd' to be glammed up for an event on a day when it was announced that up to 150 employees at Channel 10 would be losing their jobs.

Wake Up was launched in November 2013, in a bid to compete with Channel Seven's Sunrise and Channel Nine's Today and rumours have been circulating for weeks that the struggling show might be about to get the chop.

Wake Up was the brainchild of Sunrise mastermind Adam Boland, and was launched in November 2013, with three hosts, Natasha Exelby, James Mathison, and Natarsha Belling. Just 16-days later, Ms Exelby was cut from the panel, after it was decided the show's chemistry was not working.

The last episodes of Wake Up and the 5.30am news bulletin will air on Friday.

Channel Ten announced today that their new morning line-up will start on Monday.

It will feature cooking show Ready, Steady, Cook at 6am, followed by repeats of Entertainment Tonight and The Bold and The Beautiful.

Rounding out the morning is Jamie's 30 Minute meals, which starts at eight.

According to a Ten announcement, Jamie's 30 Minute Meals is a first run episode.

It has struggled to attract viewers, averaging 30-40,000 per day, around a tenth of the viewers tuning in to Channels Nine and Seven.

In his email to staff informing them of the cuts yesterday, Channel Ten CEO, Hamish McLennan stated: 'Wake Up has not resonated with enough viewers to make it a viable program.'

The extent of the redundancies are not yet known, but in his email Mr McLennan informed staff that the struggling network will also cut its 5.30am, 11am, and 10.30pm news bulletins, though it will continue to produce the 5pm news bulletin.

'It is a tough period for Ten and we need to take some painful, but necessary, measures to restructure the business,' the email to staff said.

'Unfortunately, it is proposed that Wake Up and the Early, Morning and Late News will cease production on Friday, May 23, 2014. Studio 10 is performing well and will continue as a vital part of our daytime schedule, which ranks number one.'

He concluded the email saying: 'The next few weeks will be a difficult and sad period, as colleagues leave the business.'

The last episode of Wake Up will air on Friday.

Channel 10 CEO Hamish McLennan informed staff yesterday that the breakfast show Wake Up and some news bulletins will be axed. It is rumoured that up to 150 jobs will be cut

The Wake Up replacement line-up includes Ready, Steady, Cook at 6am, followed by repeats of Bold and The Beautiful, pictured, and then first-run episodes of Jamie's 30 Minute Meals
