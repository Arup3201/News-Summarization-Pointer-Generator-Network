Not since May, 1987 have Coventry fans driven through the city blaring horns with sky blue scarves waving from car windows.

On Friday, after a soulless season spent some 35 miles away at Northampton’s Sixfields Stadium, their football team returns home to the Ricoh Arena.

A dispute over rent between the club’s owners, Sisu, and Ricoh operators, Arena Coventry Limited, has now been resolved, and nearly 25,000 are expected for the League One visit of Gillingham, hundreds having camped overnight for a ticket.

Home sweet home: Coventry haven't played at their Ricoh Arena for over a year due to a rent dispute

Pure ecstasy: Coventry's Ricoh Arena return has been viewed on par with their 1987 FA Cup success

Such is the feeling of relief, ecstasy and pride at a protest waged and won, celebration has been akin to 27 years ago when Coventry – memorably, thanks to Keith Houchen’s diving header – lifted the FA Cup following a 3-2 victory over Spurs at Wembley.

And Houchen told Sportsmail: ‘Last season I just could not comprehend that this was the same club which I played for, it was soul destroying.

‘But to be back in Coventry is brilliant. I hear fans are queuing around the block for tickets and this will be their cup final all over again.

‘They have been at their lowest ebb recently but hopefully this is the start of a new era – the fans deserve massive credit.'

Protest: Coventry fans have been calling for the club's owners to depart for the dispute over the Ricoh Arena

Little atmosphere: Coventry have been playing their home games at Northampton Town, 35 miles away

For, as Houchen alluded, this is a triumph for supporters, for those who boycotted ‘home’ matches and instead campaigned – peacefully – for a return to the city.

Barely a major sporting event has passed without representation from the ‘Keep Cov in Cov’ campaign; there were flags at the World Cup in Brazil on the Copacabana Beach and in front of Christ the Redeemer, as there have been at England internationals, be it football, cricket or rugby.

The local newspaper, the Coventry Telegraph, petitioned every Football League club to join their cause and today they print a super-sized poster marking the victory.

Since confirmation of the return, fans have posted on YouTube a remake of Baddiel and Skinner’s famous ‘Football’s Coming Home’ anthem, including the quite wonderful words: ‘Cheers for heroes in Sky Blue, we had a fight with Sisu, but we knew, we’d come through… Elephants on the shirt, FA Cup still gleaming, many years of hurt.’

Friday evening, then, promises to be some occasion.

‘A lot of fans thought we would never return,’ Michael Orton, co-ordinator of Keep Cov in Cov told us.

‘But this creates a feeling of absolute pride throughout the whole city. We have kept our dignity but have protested continuously and this is a result for everyone who boycotted Northampton (where attendances averaged around 1,500).

‘Of course, we were never that attached to the Ricoh Arena previously and we longed for Highfield Road, but absence makes the heart grow fonder and we’re determined to make this our home now. It will be a special night and a real “I was there” occasion.’

Pleased as punch: Coventry boss Steven Pressley can't wait for his side to return to the Ricoh Arena

Manager Steven Pressley has played the role of master diplomat amid the conflict, but his words were telling.

‘I think if the supporters had turned out in their numbers at Sixfields there would not have been such a great pressure to return,’ said the Scot. ‘But the supporters have voted with their feet and I think you can never forget that football clubs are built around the supporters.’

Indeed, the Sky Blues now have 25,000 around which to build their future.
