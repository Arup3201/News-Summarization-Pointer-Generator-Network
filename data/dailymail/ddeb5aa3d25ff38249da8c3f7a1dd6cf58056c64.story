A paranoid schizophrenic who axed his housemate to death after walking out of hospital left a note on the body saying: ‘I told doctors I am not safe’.

Ahmed Ali, 39, told medics at the scandal-hit Oxleas Hospital Trust he had stopped taking his medication just days before killing Abdullah Barre Jama, 45, in a frenzied axe attack.

He confessed to feeling tired and ‘persecuted’ and was due to be transferred to a psychiatric unit for further treatment.

Discharged: Ali was allowed to walk out of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in South East London - and killed just three days later

Ali had a 15-year history of mental health problems, including violent urges towards himself and others, and Mr Jama himself told doctors his flatmate was ‘crazy’.

But Ali walked out of hospital on April 30, 2009, and repeatedly stabbed Mr Jama in the head, neck and arms at their flat in Blackheath, South East London, on May 3, 2009.

Concerned friends discovered the bloodied body on a mattress in the living room the next day, with Ali’s handwritten note on the back of a film poster on top of his chest.

Prosecutor Simon Denison said the note was unreadable in parts, but included the phrase: ‘I’m innocent, I do nothing wrong'. (sic)

It also said: ‘Somalia illegal assassination is everywhere... I toll doctors and Nurstes I am not safe’. (sic)

The Oxleas Hospital Trust was slammed in 2011 after schizophrenia sufferer Nicola Edgington killed Sally Hodkin with a meat cleaver in Bexleyheath after walking out of hospital.

Mr Denison said Ali had repeatedly told doctors he believed he was the victim of a conspiracy within the Somali community.

‘He subjected Mr Jama to a frenzied attack with a hand axe, which he used to inflict severe injuries to his head, neck and arms’, he said.

‘There’s consistent evidence he has suffered from chronic paranoid psychosis, a condition which has progressively worsened from the start of his treatment until the time of the killing in May 2009.’

He said Ali had been in mental health treatment since December 1995, shortly after arriving in the UK as a refugee from war-torn Somalia.

He had previously stabbed his own brother, and became estranged from his wife and two children believing they were also involved in a conspiracy against him.

‘He believed his wife was using witchcraft against him, part of a wider conspiracy against him including his wife and the Somali community’, said Mr Denison.

His brother admitted him to hospital in May 2008 under the Mental Health Act, after Ali suffered paranoid beliefs that people were trying to kill him.

After finishing treatment at Michael Castle Centre, in Sheffield, he was released on March 31, 2009, and went back to live with Mr Jama in a flat in Blackheath.

Mr Denison said: ‘It was clear he was still unwell. Even Mr Jama said the defendant was upset with him for keeping him in hospital.

‘In April 2009, Mr Jama said the defendant was crazy and that all he talked about is killing someone or killing himself.

‘However, Mr Jama said he did not feel unsafe with the defendant.’

On April 29, 2009, Ali was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, after complaining of feeling persecuted and tired.

‘He said he was not taking his medication’, said Mr Denison.

‘He was kept in overnight and intended for transfer back to Sheffield, but left of his own accord the following day.’

He said Mr Jama was last seen alive at a Somalia social club on May 2, and friends became concerned when he failed to return the following day.

They found his bloodied body on a mattress in the flat on May 4, along with the blood stained axe lying on the floor nearby.

Ali was soon arrested, but when his case came to court, in September 2010, he was unfit to enter a plea and a murder trial went ahead without him.

After his conviction for murder, he was detained at Wathwood Hospital in Rotherham for treatment and has now been deemed fit enough to enter a plea.

Ali denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Dr Darren Bloye, his psychiatrist, said Ali was suffering ‘florid paranoid delusions’ at the time of the killing, and still believes the Somali community are against him.

Judge Richard Hone QC ordered Ali’s continued detention at the hospital under section 37 of the Mental Health Act.

He told him: ‘Because of the possibility of relapse being observed from time to time and your history, it is essential not only to make a hospital order but also a restriction order without limit of time because of the obvious and perceived risks not only to your own health and safety but to others, especially the Somali community.

‘Delusional beliefs sometimes take over and you become a serious and lethal danger to their community.’

Ali, of Blackheath, South East London denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
