It's perhaps the most daring naval mission ever undertaken by mankind - sailing on the methane seas of Saturn's icy moon Titan.

A new Nasa mission, with UK scientists on board, aims to explore these oceans - by parachuting a vessel into the seas of Titan, just less than a billion miles from Earth.

'It's a boat, essentially. You'd have been locked up if you'd suggested that before,' says Professor John Zarnecki of the Open University.

Artist's conception of the dunes on Saturn's moon: The dunes are up to 300 feet high and a mile wide, and made of frozen hydrocarbons - the chemicals found in crude oil - not sand

The 'boat' proposal will be discussed at a conference in London this week

The proposal is to be discussed at a space conference in London this week.

Previously, scientists have proposed heavier-than-air gliders to explore the icy moon - or other vehicles that could penetrate the thick clouds that shroud the planet.

Nasa's Cassini probe discovered lakes of methane on the planet in 2008.

The 'lakes' of Titan contain more 
hydrocarbons - the fuels we use cars and other energy supplies - than 
the whole supplies of Earth.

The moon is thickly shrouded in clouds, and scientists are intrigued about what lies beneath.

Titan is bigger than our own Moon and 
even the planet Mercury. The temperature at Titan's surface is about 
-178 178 degrees centigrade.

The planet also has sand dunes, just like ours.

Nasa's Cassini probe has found that 
the dunes on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan vary in shape just like 
dunes on Earth - and even look similar to deserts on our planet.

The
similarities end there, of course - not only are the dunes on Titan 300
feet high and up to a mile wide, they're made of frozen hydrocarbons - 
chemicals found in crude oil - rather than sand.

There
are four million square miles of dunes on Titan, an area the size of 
the United States. Their formations could be key to understanding the 
clouded moon's mysterious weather patterns.

The huge dunes of frozen hydrocarbons on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan were captured by Nasa's Cassini probe - and the geographical variations on Titan are similar to variations on Earth

Various proposals for the further exploration of Titan have been proposed - including heavier-than-air gliders that would float above the planet

Analysis of images sent back by Nasa's orbiting Cassini probe found that the dunes form patterns similar to deserts on Earth.

The result gives new clues about the moon’s climatic and geological history.

Dune
fields are the second most dominant landform on Titan, after the 
seemingly uniform plains, so they offer a large-scale insight into the 
moon’s peculiar environment.

Backing this 
hypothesis is the fact that Titan’s lakes and seas are not distributed 
symmetrically by latitude.

These reserves of liquid ethane and methane 
are predominantly found in the northern hemisphere, suggesting again 
that the soil is moister toward the north and so, again, the sand grains
are less easy to transport by the wind.

'Understanding
how the dunes form as well as explaining their shape, size and 
distribution on Titan’s surface is of great importance to understanding 
Titan’s climate and geology,' says Nicolas Altobelli, ESA’s 
Cassini-Huygens project scientist.
