A last-minute change avoided what could have been an uncomfortable moment in the September 11 museum dedication ceremony: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie followed by 'Bridge Over Troubled Water.'

The original program for the ceremony had Christie's remarks followed by Idina Menzel's performance of the song.

That sent social media aflutter with speculation that the scheduling was a jab at the governor over accusations that his staff intentionally clogged traffic near the George Washington Bridge to punish a political adversary.

But just before the ceremony, a museum 
spokesman announced that Menzel, star of the Broadway show 'If/Then,' 
was sick and would not perform.

In her place, fellow Broadway singer 
LaChanze, herself a 9/11 widow, performed 'Amazing Grace.'

The spokesman said the change had nothing to do with Christie or the song.

The Simon & Garfunkel song has been referenced numerous times to skewer Christie over the 'bridgegate' scandal.

The Republican strongly maintains he never had any knowledge that the bridge closing was orchestrated by staffers in his own office - and certainly never ordered the closing.

However, the scandal damaged Christie's brand. He had been considered an early front-runner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination before Bridgegate. Now, his name comes up in conversation considerably less.
