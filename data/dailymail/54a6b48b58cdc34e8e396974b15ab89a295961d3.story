A Chicago doctor has pleaded guilty to accepting $600,000 from a pharmaceutical company as a reward for prescribing high-risk anti-psychotic drugs to elderly and mentally ill patients.

Michael Reinstein was treated to luxurious cruises around Miami and more than $100,000 in speaking fees paid for by drug firm IVAX for at least four years after he started handing out their product Clozaril in 2003.

At least three of his thousands of patients died as a result of the treatment, a Chicago Tribune investigation found.

Clorazil, a form of clozapine, is known as a 'last resort' treatment for schizophrenia or suicidal tendencies.

Pleaded guilty: Michael Reinstein, 71, has admitted to receiving thousands in exchange for prescribing a drug

Though Reinstein describes the drug as 'an under-prescribed treatment for severe mental illness', data shows side effects include seizures and inflammation of the heart wall.

After settling a civil suit with the family of a dead patient and forfeiting his medical license, the 71-year-old is now facing federal criminal charges for allegedly prescribing various forms of the drug to more than 140,000 patients.  

At one point Reinstein prescribed the drug to 300 out of 400  residents of a nursing home, the federal suit claims.

Pleading guilty to the criminal charge, he will be forced to pay $592,000 and faces up to four years in jail - but could have the sentence reduced to 18 months if he assists the prosecution's investigation.

Reinstein, of Skokie, Illinois, first accepted payment to promote Clorazil when it was created in the early 2000s, court documents read by the Chicago Tribune allege.

He signed an agreement with IVAX in 2003 to prescribe an early version of the treatment in exchange for a yearly $50,000 consultation fee, which covered speaking engagements.

Over the next three years, Reinstein and his wife were treated to trips to Miami, cruises, golfing holidays, and fishing trips, the Tribune reports.

The perks allegedly continued after IVAX was sold to Teva, an Israeli firm which paid for Reinstein and his colleagues to board a boat cruise, reportedly worth $2,300, and dinners that each totaled $1,700. 

Teva paid $27.6 million in an out-of-court settlement last year after being sued over the alleged 'kickback scheme'.

Reinstein had a long history of claiming expenses to Medicaid before he started prescribing Clorazil, according to a joint investigation by the Chicago Tribune and ProPublica.

In the 1990s, he charged for treating 490 patients in five days, the investigation revealed.

Defending his use of clozapines to the Chicago Tribune on Friday, Reinstein said: 'I'm not trying to be cavalier about it - anyone on Clozaril or any other psychotropic medication needs to be monitored carefully. But the drug is not by itself dangerous.'

Reinstein is also facing a civil suit leveled by the state of Illinois over allegedly forged Medicaid claims. The suit alleges his prescriptions were influenced by pharmaceutical companies rather than his own diagnoses.
