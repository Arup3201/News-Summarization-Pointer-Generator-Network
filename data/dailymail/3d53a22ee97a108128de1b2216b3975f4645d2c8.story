A married Navy commander met a woman 20 years his junior on a dating website, got her pregnant and then pretended he had died to escape the relationship, the woman has claimed.

In light of the claims, Navy Cmdr. Michael P. Ward II, 43, has been relieved of his duties as commanding officer of USS Pittsburgh - a role he began just ten days ago.

The unidentified woman from Chesapeake, Virginia said she met Ward on a dating website in October 2011 and he told her he was separated.

'Liar': Michael P. Ward II is pictured leaving the USS Pittsburgh after taking command on August 3. He has been relieved of his duties after a woman said they conducted an affair before he faked his death

Ward, who is in fact married with children, told the woman he worked in 'special ops' and that his name was Tony Moore, she said.

'I want you, but I don't know how to 
make this all perfect,' he wrote in a text, which the woman showed to The Day. In another, he wrote: 'I love you
 and I always will.'

But on July 6, she received an email from a man named Bob, who claimed he worked with Ward.

'Deceptive': Ward told the woman he was separated, but he is married with children

'He asked me to contact you if this ever
 happened,' it said. 'I am extremely sorry to tell you that he is
 gone. We tried everything we could to save him. I cannot say more. I am
 sorry it has to be this way.'

The email concluded: 'He loved you very much', and said Bob had something to pass onto her from Ward.

On July 9, she drove to Ward's house in 
Burke, Virginia with relatives to pay her respects. But the home's new 
owner said Ward was alive and had moved to Connecticut to take over USS 
Pittsburgh.

She became ill and went to hospital, where she found out she was pregnant, she said. She has since lost the child, she said.

'I
 don't want revenge here,' she told The Day. 'I want everyone to know 
the truth about Michael. He does not need to be commanding a submarine. 
He's a deceitful man.'

She has contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and the master chief of the USS Pittsburgh with her complaints.

Ward,
 who is originally from Buffalo, New York and now lives in Gales Ferry 
in Connecticut, overtook command of the USS Pittsburgh, an attack 
submarine, in a glitzy ceremony on August 3.

Scandal: Ward met the woman on a dating website (file picture) in October 2011. She later received an email from someone claiming to be his colleague to say he had died, she said

In a statement, the Navy said a captain relieved Ward on Friday 'due to lack of confidence in Ward's ability
 to command based upon allegations of personal misconduct on the part of
 Ward'.

'Our Navy has a very clear and 
unambiguous standard regarding the character of our commanding officers,
 spelled out in the Charge of Command,' Capt. Vernon Parks said in the press release.

'I reviewed this Charge with Cmdr.
 Ward before he assumed command. He understood the Navy's high standards
 for command leadership and he failed to uphold them.'

USS Pittsburgh has now been taken over by Cmdr. Michael Savageaux - the commander whom Ward relieved just 10 days ago when he took over the ship.

Ward has been reassigned to administrative 
duties on a different vessel in Submarine Group Two.

Losing control: The demotion came just a week after Ward took command of USS Pittsburgh, pictured

He joined the Navy in 1987 and has served on the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon.

'My dream job is and always has been commanding a submarine,' he said upon taking command of USS Pittsburgh. 'This is the culmination of a dream I have had from a very young age.'

Lt. Cmdr. Jennifer Cragg of the group said the Navy would not be releasing any further details of the 
investigation until it is complete.
