Those aren’t shooting stars or UFOs screaming across the night sky.

After a year of painstaking labour, 22-year-old Milton Tan has put together an incredible time-lapse video that shows planes taking off and landing at hyper speed at night.

The 22-year-old filmmaker snapped more than 11,000 photos with two cameras when he was granted exclusive access to parts of Singapore Changi Airport.

Tan spliced together 7,000 photos to create the three-and-a-half minute video called The Air Traffic 2.

The result is an enthralling video that captures the hectic pace of one of the busiest airports in the world. 

Tan was granted access to a restricted area of the runway during the summer of 2013 after airport personnel were wowed by one of his earlier time-lapse films.

He spent two days snapping thousands of photos as flights landed and took off almost every minute during peak hours.

He said on his blog: ‘I was so close to the planes that my cameras literally got shaken by the rumbles from the jet engines, which actually produced a pretty neat effect.

‘It was a thrilling experience as you don't usually get to enter the restricted runway area, let alone shoot in it.’

Tan describes the scenes in his time-lapse film as a ‘sci-fi world with shooting stars breaking into the atmosphere’.

He said the shots were taken at four- to ten-second exposures and at zero-second intervals, meaning the shutter opens again to snap another photo immediately after closing.

That ensures that the lights from the planes move smoothly through the frame, Tan explained.
