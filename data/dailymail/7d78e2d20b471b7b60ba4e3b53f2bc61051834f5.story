Chelsea are launching a bid to sign Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina as they anticipate losing either Andre Schurrle or Mohamed Salah.

Cuadrado, a Colombia international winger, has a release clause of £26.8million and Fiorentina do not wish to negotiate for less.

Jose Mourinho knows Schurrle and Salah both want to leave as they grow frustrated with their lack of regular game time but he will not authorise the sales without bringing another player in.

Fiorentina have cut short the loan of Chelsea’s Marko Marin, who joined Anderlecht on Tuesday, and have asked about Salah themselves though the Egyptian favours a move to Roma.

Chelsea are also awaiting a £23million offer from Wolfsburg for Schurrle but are holding out for a £30m fee for the 24-year-old German.

Conscious of fitting within FFP guidelines they will want to cover the purchase price of Cuadrado and make a profit.

Mohamed Salah has been linked with a move to Roma, but Fiorentina have also enquired

Mourinho was keen on the 26-year-old while Real Madrid and Manchester United were linked with him last summer before they realised they could sign Angel di Maria.

Cuadrado can play on either flank and can also operate as a wing-back. Although he has not been in the best of form this season, he has experience, good pace and works for his team. 

He finished the World Cup alongside Toni Kroos with the most assists.
