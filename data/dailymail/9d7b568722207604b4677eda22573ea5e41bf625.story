A slick English-language magazine released by Al-Qaeda's media wing has called on wannabe jihadists to target British  department stores in bomb attacks.

The chilling online publication, entitled 'Palestine: Betrayal of the Guilty Conscience Al-Malahem' instructs militants on how to build homemade bombs, and suggests a number of high-profile targets.

Among those listed in the UK are military academy Sandhurst, the MI5 headquarters and well-known department stores - which Al-Qaeda orders should only be attacked on Friday afternoons when Muslims are praying at their mosque.

The well-produced digital magazine includes a nine-page spread on how to 'make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom,' as well as features on car bombs and a celebratory timeline of terror attacks in the West, which concludes with the entry '201?' - implying new terror attacks are planned.

Terrorist's handbook: 'Palestine: Betrayal of the guilty conscience' is an English-language online publication that encourage extremists living in Western countries to carry out acts of terrorism

The magazine was created by the media arm of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, known as AQAP and focuses on preparing wannabe terrorists for 'lone wolf' attacks - believed to be al-Qaeda's new preferred method in an age where Western intelligence makes life difficult for organised terror cells.

Once militants have followed the instructions and prepared their homemade bombs, the magazine suggests a list of targets on which to try them out - including shops, Sandhurst and Thames House in the UK, Times Square, mega-casinos, oil tankers and the Georgia Military College in the U.S., and any international holiday resort known to be frequented by American or Israeli tourists

Included in the list of celebrated 'jihadists events' is the date '201?', which suggests al-Qaeda plans to carry out another major terrorist attack at some point in the next five years.

The guide to making a car bomb comes complete with step-by-step photographs, a shopping list, and admiring words about the Tsarnaev brothers who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings.

'My Muslim brother: we are conveying to you our military training right into your kitchen to relieve you of the difficulty of traveling to us,' it reads.

Haunting: The disturbing publication ends with the words, 'We are coming'

'If you are sincere in your intentions to serve the religion of Allāh, then all what you have to do is enter your kitchen and make an explosive device that would damage the enemy if you put your trust in Allah and then use this explosive device properly.'

At the end is a list of 'examples of targets,' including oil tankers and trains, casinos in Las Vegas, and the General Atomics headquarters in San Diego.

The publication is an adjunct to Inspire magazine - which is aimed at encouraging Muslims in Western countries to carry out terror attacks.

'Inspire Magazine's goal is to empower Muslim. And what is empowerment without being strong, powerful and intelligent? In this section, we give you strength, power and intelligence. Believe me, using car bombs gives you all that,' the publications reads.
