Marco Reus' World Cup place could be in doubt after the Germany star limped out of his country's 6-1 win against Armenia after suffering suspected ankle ligament damage.

The Borussia Dortmund went down after he tussled for the ball with opposing midfielder Artur Yedigaryan.

Reus was left on the ground in pain and had to receive medical treatment before being carried off just before half-time.

The 25-year-old was unable to put any weight on his injured leg as he left the field, with reports suggesting that he was taken straight to hospital to find out the full extent of the damage.

With Joachim Low's side set to face Portugal in their World Cup opener on June 16, Reus could be ruled out of this summer's tournament if his injury is deemed serious.

Reus will now be assessed before Low decides whether to call up a replacement for the trip to Brazil.

Speaking after the game, Low said: 'We can only hope that he will be OK. But it looked bad. We can call up another player until 24 hours before the first game.'

Reus, who was a summer target for Manchester United, ruled out a move to Old Trafford in an interview with German magazine Kicker earlier this month.

He said: 'It's safe to say I will be playing for Borussia Dortmund also in the 2014/2015 season.

'Basically I do not need to stress all the time that I am feeling great being with the club.

'As far as leaving (Borussia Dortmund) that is no issue for me, and I am not affected by it (the transfer release clause).'
