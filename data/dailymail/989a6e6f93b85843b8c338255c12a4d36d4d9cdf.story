A woman who was allegedly gang-raped by four Vanderbilt football players while she was unconscious vomited in court today as one of the men testified that he has no memory of the attack.

Cory Batey, 20, took the stand in Nashville, Tennessee on Monday and testified that he woke up the morning after the alleged assault in June 2013 and found explicit photos on his cellphone of him and the woman as he got ready for church. He said he did not recognize her.

'I was horrified,' Batey said. 'I didn't know how they got there. I didn't know what had happened to the young lady in the pictures and and I immediately deleted them.'

The graphic images, which allegedly show the men sexually assaulting the 21-year-old neuroscience student after a night of partying, were previously shown to the jury.

On the stand: Cory Batey testified in his rape trial on Monday that he had no recollection of attacking an unconscious woman in a Vanderbilt dorm room in June 2013. He and three other men are accused

Witnesses have also testified that Batey slapped and urinated on the student as she lay unconscious in the dorm room.

But after the alleged assault came to light, Batey told authorities that he had not touched the girl, the court heard on Monday.

'I just went along with the storyline of what [fellow defendant Brandon] Banks had told me because I had no recollection of what had happened,' he responded.

He said he could not remember anything because he had consumed so much alcohol the night before. Last week, the jury heard that he had had as many as 22 drinks.

'I was just drunk out of my mind,' he testified on Monday. 'This is something I would never do in my right state of mind. I'm just sorry.'

He repeatedly said that he could not remember details of the days after the alleged attack, including messages he sent to other men accused of trying to cover up the incident. 

Evidence: Batey looks through text messages he exchanged with his girlfriend and friends after the alleged attack. He repeatedly told attorneys he could not remember messages he sent in the days following

Accused: Brandon Vandenburg, pictured in court on Monday, is also on trial for allegedly raping the woman in the dorm room. He was dating her at the time and 'egged on' the other players, according to testimony

But he admitted to jurors that he was in the graphic images they saw. He said he took responsibility.

'So, Mr. Batey, today you say that you are accepting responsibility for your actions?' asked Roger Moore, one of the prosecutors in the case. 'Does that mean you are changing your plea?' 

Batey said no. 

The former football player, who carried 'The Bible Promise Book' to the witness stand, looked at the jury as he responded to questions. He appeared nervous while on the stand, repeatedly licking his lips as he answered the attorneys.

The victim, who has attended the 11 days of testimony, at one point vomited during Batey's testimony, The Tennessean reported. 

The woman, who last week said that she has no recollection of being sexually assaulted, cried during his testimony and bent forward, prompting a court official to inquire if she was OK. 

Batey was 19 and had just come out of his freshman year when he and three of his teammates were charged with raping an unconscious student in a dorm on the Nashville campus in June 2013.

On Friday, an expert witness for the defense testified that Batey was so drunk after consuming between 14 and 22 drinks that his ability to 'act knowingly' was impaired. 

'He was so intoxicated he was not his normal self,' Dr. James Walker, a forensic neuropsychologist said. 'He was doing things he would not normally have done.' 

After allegedly raping the woman - in a brutal attack that was captured in cell phone footage and sent to Vandenburg's friends - Batey spent the night with his girlfriend, the court heard.

As details of the attack started to emerge, his girlfriend asked him what had happened. 

On trial: Batey, pictured, was 19 when he allegedly assaulting the woman after a night of drinking

'You are asking questions I can't answer,' he texted her in response.

Batey's defense team has said that his judgment was changed by a campus culture of binge drinking and promiscuous sex. 

'Batey did exactly what his college culture told him,' his defense attorney, Worrick Robinson said in his closing arguments.

But in her closing arguments on Monday afternoon, prosecutor Jan Norman pointed out that voluntary intoxication is not a defense for aggravated rape.

'The only person that was unconscious and unaware of what was going on (was the victim),' she said. 

The incident only came to light only after Vanderbilt officials reviewed a dormitory surveillance video following a report of vandalism.

When they reviewed the footage, they saw an unconscious woman being dragged into a dorm room. They called Nashville police, who opened an investigation.

The assault lasted for 29 minutes but police only recovered footage one minute long, Norman told the jury in her closing arguments.

The closing arguments will wrap up on Tuesday and then the jury will deliberate. 

Batey is on trial with Brandon Vandenburg, 21, who had been dating the woman at the time of the alleged assault.

Two other men, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks, are also accused in the attack but are not on trial yet.

All are charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg additionally faces a charge of unlawful photography and tampering with evidence. They have all pleaded not guilty.
