He is China’s new football ambassador being paid a small fortune to lend his clean-cut image to the Chinese league, which is riddled with corruption and foul play.

But instead of demonstrating the virtues of good conduct, David Beckham sparked a stampede in Shanghai that left seven people injured - and forced his visit to be cancelled.

Fans stormed the gates of a university football stadium to catch a glimpse of the former England football star on his arrival.

The situation spun out of control as more and more people pushed into the security guards

One female police officer was carried away with blood streaming from a face wound while another male officer was pictured lying on the ground unconscious with a bloody head wound.

Several delirious fans had to be restrained. In all, five security staff and two fans were injured and taken to hospital.

Students and youngsters were crushed against the gates as the numbers increased

'I was on the second row, wanting to take a photo of Beckham. Every one jostled each other. I wanted to get out of it but couldn’t,' said one female fan caught up in mayhem.

'Then I was pushed towards the gate. People in front of me fell but those from behind continue to push. Then I and others fell too,' she added 

The Tongji University said on its website at least two police officers, two security guards and one student were injured in the frenzy.

Video and photos posted online showed shoes, bags and other belongings from the students and fans - many left in tears and shock - scattered beside a fence near the stadium entrance.

The event was immediately cancelled and 38-year-old Beckham was bundled by his body guards out of the stadium to the safety of his limo.

Witnesses said that the situation was 'too crazy' and that students struggled to escape the crush

The former Manchester United midfielder is in China on a seven-day tour to promote the Chinese Super League which is blighted by corrupt refs, players and club owners.

A post on Beckham’s microblog on the popular Chinese-language Sina Weibo – China’s Twitter-like social media network - wished the injured speedy recoveries and expressed regret for the cancellation.

‘It was impossible to get through the massive crowds,’ it said.

‘Too crazy,’ said Chu Dan, a Tongji University football player who was hoping to have ‘some interaction on the pitch’ with Beckham.

‘But we didn't expect so many people showing up here - too many fans of Beckham,’ he added.

Estimates of his fee for three week-long visits have ranged from £1.7 million, according to a CSL spokesman quoted in People's Daily to £50 million

The
 ex England stalwart, who recently retired from Paris Saint-Germain, was
 appointed China's Global Ambassador for Football in March.

Estimates
 of his fee for three week-long visits have ranged from £1.7 million, 
according to a CSL spokesman quoted in People's Daily to £50 million, 
according to a report in Italian sports daily La Gazzetta Dello Sport.

Taking the lowest figure, that's £566,000 for each weekly trip - double the amount Manchester United star Wayne Rooney receives.
