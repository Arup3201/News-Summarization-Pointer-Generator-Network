Exclusive access to a swimming pool and no queues for flumes seems like a treat restricted to the rich and famous.  

But two friends made it a reality when they hid in the changing rooms of Cascades Leisure Centre in Kent so they could swim and ride on as many flumes as they wanted after dark. 

The pair had the run of the Kent leisure centre during the evening, using the flumes, a children's slide, clambering over an ornamental crocodile and even skinny dipping.

Dan Jarvis, 26, and Raith O'Shea, 27, filmed themselves riding the flumes and swimming after the lights had gone out.

Dan Jarvis, 26, and Raith O'Shea hid in the changing rooms of Cascades Leisure Centre in Kent so they could use the flumes, play on ornaments and even go skinny dipping after the centre had closed to the public 

But the prank has seen them criticised by security bosses who warned it could have been dangerous and said safety measures had now been reviewed. 

Mr Jarvis, a media student at London South Bank University said: 'I had planned it for about a month or two and then one day I just said to Raith we should do it on that night because we were bored.

'We hid in the changing rooms for about 40 minutes before we came out.

'The cleaner was cleaning the changing rooms so we quickly went in one they had already cleaned and just sat there.

'We had to hide our clothes because we couldn't use the lockers and just waited for the lights to go off and the security to leave.' 

He said after the cleaners left at about 9pm the pair went into the pool, staying there about two hours. 

'It was quite hot in there because the air con had been turned off so when we were jumping in the pool it was nice and cool,' he added. 

'We had such a laugh in there and stayed till about 11pm, the flumes were switched off but because of the water it was still slippery so we could still use them a bit.

'I haven't had a call from the centre or the police yet, and I don't think I would do it again at that pool because the security will be really tight now.

'I might consider doing it at another pool further away though, you never know.' 

Dan Jarvis posted the video on his Facebook page and said it has already been shared multiple times

The friends have been criticised by security bosses who said they could have created a dangerous situation

Mr Jarvis posted an edited video on Facebook, called Cascades Leisure Centre after hours night edition.' The one minute and 26 second clip features pictures of the pair hanging off rides and ends with the caption 'I'm never growing up.' 

At the end the pair bid their viewers farewell and said the escapade had been 'emotional.' 

The video has already been shared by dozens of his friends.

Gravesham Community Leisure Ltd (GCLL) in Gravesend, Kent, has condemned the stunt.

Rob Swain said: 'There was a breach of GCLL's security measures on Sunday evening with two persons hiding themselves on purpose within the building at Cascades Leisure Centre.

Dan Jarvis decided to stay in the leisure centre after dark because he was bored and had been planning it

Raith O'Shea is pictured riding one of the flumes at the leisure centre after he hid until cleaners left at 9pm 

The friends filmed themselves climbing over an ornamental crocodile as well as on the centre's flumes 

'This resulted in them being in the building at a time when it was locked.

'GCLL's security alarm system was operated with staff attending the site but the two persons had vacated the building prior to the arrival of staff.

'GCLL are in liaison with Kent Police on this matter with the most appropriate action being taken in due course.

'It should be said that this could be an extremely dangerous situation with unsupervised persons in such a facility as a leisure centre.'

Just hours before the prank, Dan wrote on Facebook that he planned to go to the pool next weekend and asked people if they wanted to join him.
