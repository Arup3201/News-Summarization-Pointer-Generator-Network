We are used to seeing celebrity contestants being sent home from Strictly Come Dancing. But in a departure from the usual choreography, now the professionals are being given the boot.

The BBC has announced that show veterans James Jordan and Artem Chigvintsev, along with recent recruit Anya Garnis, will not return in the autumn.

The drastic cull will make way for some new faces, including 30-year-old Joanne Clifton – sister of Kevin from Grimsby.

Ousted: James Jordan leaves - but his wife Ola stays

The five-times British Ballroom Champion and her brother were trained by their parents at the family dance academy and will now become the first siblings to take part in Strictly, where Kevin, 31, made it to the final of the 11th series in December.

But after eight years, viewers will see no more of Mr Jordan.

He was sacked after reports he clashed with judge Craig Revel Horwood, and it is understood the BBC felt he and his Polish-born wife Ola, 31, dominated the show too much.

While Mrs Jordan will stay, Mr Jordan turned down a reduced role that would allow him to appear only in the show’s specials.

Meanwhile Russian-born Mr Chigvintsev blamed his exit on visa issues, writing on Twitter: ‘Let’s hope my visa situation will change in the future... I decided to stay in US to sort my citizenship.’

The other new arrivals will be Irish dancer Tristan MacManus, 31, who spent three years on Dancing With The Stars in the US, and Australian Natalie Lowe, 33, who withdrew last year due to injury.

Executive producer Louise Rainbow said: ‘We’re delighted that Joanne and Tristan will be joining our fantastic cast. A huge thank you goes out to both Artem and James for being hardworking, dedicated dancers.’
