But Pochettino, who was in charge of the Saints last year, said: 'It's not my style to speak about another player.'

Meanwhile, Pochettino insists Andros Townsend has a future at Tottenham amid interest from Queens Park Rangers.

Harry Redknapp is keen on taking the England winger before the transfer window closes.

'Like all the players, he is in the squad so he is important. He was injured for the World Cup so he has to recover.'

Townsend helped England reach the finals in Brazil but was forced to make do with a punditry role with ITV during the tournament.

Tottenham have recently signed DeAndre Yedlin from the MLS - though he won't be available until next season - and Pochettino has hinted he will make do with what he's got at the club.

'It (new signings) is not my concern. I think we have an unbelievable squad.

'Last season the club made a big investment and they signed unbelievable players. The most important thing is to develop our players and to provide the best team to play on the pitch.

'We try to push him and all the players. But it is true we expect good things from him [Lamela].'

Spurs face West Ham in their Premier League opener, looking to bounce back after losing all three competitive games to the Hammers last season. 

'We are ready. It's a London derby so it will be tough. The past is the past. We have to learn from the past. But its my first year here.
