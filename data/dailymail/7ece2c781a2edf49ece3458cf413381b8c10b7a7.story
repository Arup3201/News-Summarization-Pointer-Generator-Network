Mo Farah will compete in the Lisbon Half Marathon on March 22.

The Olympic and world champion over 5,000 and 10,000 metres will open his outdoor season by competing in the race for the first time.

'We are very proud to have Mo in this race for the first time,' race organiser Carlos Moia said on www.iaaf.org.

Farah won Olympic gold in the 5,000 and 10,000 metres at London in 2012

Moia wants the assembled field to challenge Eritrean Zerzenay Tadese's world record of 58 minutes 23 seconds, which he set on the same course in 2010.

Farah set his best of 60:00 at the 2014 Bupa Great North Run.

The Briton is due to race for the first time in 2015 at the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix in Birmingham on February 21.
