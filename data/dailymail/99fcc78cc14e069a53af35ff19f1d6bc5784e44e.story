In the line of fire: Edward Pinder, 10, practices by throwing the eight-inch blades at his 37-year-old mother Erika

A young British knife-thrower has unearthed an unusual way of honing his skills - by hurling blades at his mother.

Every night after his homework Edward Pinder, 10, throws the knives at his mother Erika.

The youngster, who has been performing the routine since he was a toddler, perfects his throwing at a specially constructed circus ring at the family home in Bisbrooke, Leicestershire.

Despite the years of risk-taking practice, he has never once hit his 37-year-old mother with the eight-inch blades.

Edward
now performs his act with the family's circus around the country, 
having completed the first show of their latest tour without any scrapes
last week.

Edward said that despite his accuracy and lack of nerves, he thinks his mother is a 'little bit' nervous during routines.

But the youngster plans to up the stakes, learning how to throw stars and axes, and even hoping to get his father involved.Â 

He said: 'I try and practice as much as I can so usually have an hour or so every night when I've done my homework.'

'The knives are about as sharp as kitchen knives, but I'm not allowed to use those ones at home.

Following last week's performance, 
mother-of-two Mrs Pinder said: 'I was a bit nervous, but Edward was 
really calm and everything was fine - and the audience really enjoyed 
it.

'It was really, really scary when I was waiting for him to throw his first knife at me.

She added: 'I had seen him practice and knew he could throw in a straight line, but my heart was jumping, I was terrified.

'Edward uses professional knives and they're really sharp - they have to be to stick into the wood.

Despite the obvious risks involved, Mrs Pinder said the routine works because her and her son 'feel comfortable and both trust each other'.

Practice makes perfect: Edward said he usually practices for around an hour after his homework every night

She added: 'Touch wood, we haven't had any accidents so far.

'When he's throwing the knives, he's in charge - he's the parent and I'm the child - but only for the few minutes of the act.'

Father Eddy, 38, is a clown in Pinder's Circus which been entertaining crowds across Europe since 1850.

He said: 'Edward is definitely the youngest knife thrower in Britain and, as far as we know he's also the youngest in Europe. We are extremely proud of him.'
