Joe Biden made another gaffe on the campaign trail on Wednesday by mistaking what century it was less than 24 hours after his 'put y'all back in chains' race-baiting caused uproar.

Biden seemed to mistake this century for the 1900s when he told a Virginia crowd: 'Folks, where's it written we cannot lead the world in the 20th century in making automobiles?'

In a statement to the Weekly Standard, Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams was quick to take a jab at Biden.

Williams said: 'Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will ensure America leads the world in the 21st century by strengthening middle-class families and creating jobs.

Standing by his VP: President Obama, pictured on Wednesday during a campaign stop in Davenport, Iowa, defended Biden and clarified the comments

Gaffe: Biden, pictured on August 14, sparked outrage with his 'put y'all back in chains' speech

'President Obama and Vice President Biden have taken our nation backward with failed policies that have resulted in higher unemployment, more debt, and a weaker economy. A campaign based on rage and divisiveness can't hide the president's failed record.'

Even as he's faced with a chorus of Republican uproar, President Obama is standing by his man.

The commander-in-chief fended off criticism of Joe Biden after the vice president declared during a campaign stop on Tuesday that Obama's opponent Mitt Romney wanted to 'put ya'll back in chains.'

Hours after those comment hit the airwaves, Republicans came out in force to suggest that it might be time for the president to put the 69-year-old Biden out to pasture.

Among them was former Alaska Gov Sarah Palin, who went so far as to propose that Biden should be replaced with Hillary Clinton if Obama wants to be re-elected.

Speaking on Wednesday, Obama clarified Biden’s remarks, telling People magazine that he meant consumers would be worse off if the GOP succeeded in doing away with new restraints on financial institutions.

"In no sense was he trying to connote something other than that," Obama said.

In Iowa for a bus tour, Obama said the reaction to Biden's remarks was a function of politics, but he did not blame him.

Backlash: Sarah Palin called Biden's remark 'disgusting'

'The truth is that during the course of these campaigns, folks like to get obsessed with how something was phrased even if everybody personally understands that's not how it was meant,' Obama told the magazine.

He added: 'That's sort of the nature of modern campaigns and modern coverage of campaigns. But I tell you, when I'm traveling around Iowa, that's not what's on people's minds.'

On Tuesday in Danville, Virginia, Biden told a crowd: ‘'He [Romney] said in the first 100 days he’s going to let the big banks write their own rules, unchain Wall Street.'

Before an audience that included hundreds of black people, Biden added: 'They're going to put y’all back in chains.'

Palin, who was John McCain’s running mate during his failed presidential bid in 2008, called the quote 'disgusting.'

Shake up: Sarah Palin has said Obama should replace Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton as vice president

Swap: Palin suggested that Obama, pictured at a campaign stop on Tuesday in Iowa, replace Biden with his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, right

She suggested that the Obama campaign would be much better off if it dumped Biden for Hillary Clinton.

Palin told Fox News host Greta Van Susteren on Tuesday: 'The strategists there in the Obama campaign have got to look at a diplomatic way of replacing Joe Biden on the ticket with Hillary... Joe Biden really drags down that ticket.'

She added that she hoped Obama would not take such a step because ‘an Obama/Clinton ticket would have a darn good chance of winning.'

Palin was joined by another prominent Republican, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who questioned the vice president’s 'mental capacity.'

Giuliani told CNBC: 'I've never seen a vice president that has made as many mistakes, said as many stupid things.'

Questions: Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani has called Biden 'not very bright' in life of his recent gaffes

'I mean, there’s a real fear if, God forbid, he ever had to be entrusted with the presidency, whether he really has the mental capacity to handle it.

'I mean, this guy just isn’t bright. He’s never been bright. He isn’t bright. And people think, “Well, he just talks a little too much.” Actually he’s just not very smart.'

There is, however, very little chance that Obama would drop Biden as his running mate and it is doubtful that Clinton would even want the job.

Even as Obama stuck up for his No. 2, it didn’t stop Biden from making yet another gaffe on the campaign trail.

He's at it again: Biden made another gaffe on Wednesday when he told a Virginia crowd when he seemed to mistake this century for the 1900s

 Speaking in Athens, Ohio about John McCain's economic strategy, he

 During a political rally in Missouri, he urged wheelchair-bound state

you… what am I talking about?’September 2008:
 After he was named the vice presidential nominee, he addressed a crowd 
in Nashua, New Hampshire, questioning how he beat out Hillary Clinton:

'Quite frankly it might have been a better pick than me.'August 2008:
 He also mixed up Barack Obama’s name at his first campaign rally with
