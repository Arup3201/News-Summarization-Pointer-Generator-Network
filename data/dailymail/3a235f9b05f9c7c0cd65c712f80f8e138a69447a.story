The administrator behind Caterham believes they have until the end of January to find a buyer if the team is to have any hope of competing in Formula One this year.

Negotiations remain ongoing with three credible candidates, although they have been described as 'annoyingly slow' by Finbarr O'Connell, administrator at London-based company Smith & Williamson.

With just four weeks to the first of the three pre-season tests, with Jerez the venue for four days from February 1, and 10 weeks to go ahead of the season-opening grand prix in Australia, time is fast running out.

Caterham will be allowed to compete in the 2015 Formula One season should they find a new buyer

O'Connell said: 'We are in talks with a few people who have the wherewithal if they decided to go ahead.

'But it's a tough investment decision. Formula One is so expensive and there is not a line of people queueing to get in.

'There are only a very limited number of parties who can afford to get into it.

'One of those interested is a billionaire who would come into F1 for himself and to promote his products, whilst the other two are in the automotive industry.'

Asked whether he remained hopeful a deal could be struck, O'Connell added: 'These people can all do it, and I would like them to move quicker because there is a limited period of time.

'But if you are spending £100million you are not going to buy it and rush in at the end and do a half-baked season for 2015.

Caterham are interesting three different parties, but none have so far moved to takeover the team

'People who are spending that amount of money per season want to do it completely properly.

'However, there is only now a small window of time to do 2015 as well as it can be done.

'My view is we have this month and that's it. It might slip into next month, but only if final details are being resolved.'

Caterham went into administration in October and sat out the races in the United States and Brazil before making all 230 staff redundant.

A crowdfunding project that raised £2.35m allowed the team to make the grid at the season-ending race in Abu Dhabi towards the end of November and put themselves back in the shop window.

With talks still going on between the administrator and potential buyers, creditors for now are playing a patient game whilst they await an outcome.
