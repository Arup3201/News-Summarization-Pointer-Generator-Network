A nurse is facing the death penalty after she was found guilty of injecting dialysis tubes with bleach, killing five patients and injuring five more.

Kimberly Saenz, 38, was last night found guilty of capital murder in the deaths and aggravated assault in the injuries at the DaVita Dialysis clinic in Lufkin, Texas.

As her trial, which began on March 5, moves to the punishment phase, the mother-of-two will face either life imprisonment or the death penalty. Prosecutors had said they would seek the death penalty if she was convicted.

Guilty: Kimberly Saenz, accused of killing five of her patients and injuring five others by injecting bleach into their kidney dialysis tubing, was found guilty of capital murder

Distress: Carla Mott, daughter of murder victim Cora Bryant, hugs her nephew Torrance Agnew after verdicts were read in the murder trial of Kimberly Saenz

Condemned: Kimberly Saenz, 38, will face either life imprisonment or the death penalty

Saenz was caught after a top fire
 official wrote an anonymous letter pleading for state health department
 inspectors to visit a clinic because of numerous calls for paramedics.

The April 2008 letter said: 'In the last two weeks, we have transported 16 patients.This seems a little abnormal and disturbing to my med crews. Could these calls be investigated by you?'

Within days, surveyors arrived. By that time, emergency crews had been called 30 times that month, including seven for cardiac problems. Four people had died.

This was compared to just two calls during the previous 15 months, according to the Texas Department of Health Services.

A review of clinic records by an 
inspector found Saenz was on duty for 84 per cent of instances where 
patients suffered chest pain or cardiac arrest.

Scene: In April 2008, two patients at the DaVita Dialysis Center said they saw Saenz inject bleach into tubing used by two patients who later died

On April 28, 2008, two dialysis patients said they did not feel well and two others reported that they saw Saenz inject bleach into tubing used by patients Marva Rhone and Carolyn Risinger.

Patients visited the DaVita Dialysis clinic in Lufkin, Texas, for dialysis treatment, which is required to filter the blood when kidneys are no longer able to do so.

In the treatment, blood is allowed to flow a few ounces at a time through a filter that removes wastes and extra fluids. The clean blood is then returned to the body.

Traces of bleach were found in the dialysis tubing, which is made from a cellophane material and used to ensure a steady filtering flow of molecules to the patient.

Ingesting significant quantities of bleach can lead to vomiting, respiratory problems and cardiac arrest.

Prosecutors claimed Saenz injected these bags with bleach.

Her defense team said that bleach is widely used in clinics and traces do not indicate Saenz put it there. They suggest someone else might have or that she is being used as a scapegoat for the clinic's mistakes.

Saenz's attorneys argued that she and others used syringes rather 
than measuring cups for bleach to ensure precise amounts were being used
 for proper mixing of cleaning solutions.

They said she was spotted 
measuring bleach into a syringe because she wanted to put the right 
amount into cleaning water.

Former DaVita employees who testified for prosecutors told jurors that 
they never used syringes instead of measuring cups to ensure the proper 
amounts of bleach were being used in cleaning solutions.

Saenz, who had held her entry-level position as a licensed vocational nurse for eight months, was sent home and fired the next day.

A year later, an indictment listed sodium hypochlorite, also known as bleach, as the 'deadly weapon' used by Saenz to kill five people, including Rhone and Risinger.

Saenz's lawyers previously said she had no motive to kill.

'Kimberly Saenz is a good nurse, a compassionate, a caring individual who assisted her patients and was well liked,' defense attorney T. Ryan Deaton said.

He argued that Saenz was 
being targeted by the clinic's owner for faulty procedures at the 
facility, including improper water purification, suggesting 
that officials at the clinic 
fabricated evidence against her.

Saenz didn't take the stand in her own defense. But in a recording played at trial, she could be heard testifying before a grand jury that she felt 'railroaded' by the clinic and 'would never inject bleach into a patient'.

Prosecutors described claims Saenz 
was being set up by her employer as 'absolutely ridiculous'.

They described her as a 
depressed and disgruntled employee who complained about specific 
patients, including some of those who died or were injured.

Saenz had sworn in an affidavit she had no previous felony record. But documents filed by Angelina County District Attorney Clyde Herrington listed about a dozen instances of wrongdoing.

They included allegations Saenz overused prescription drugs, had substance abuse and addiction problems, was fired at least four times from health care jobs and put false information on an employment application, the AP reported.

Clinic: Investigators were called to the clinic after a boom in emergency calls

Investigators examined blood 
tubing, IV bags and syringes used by the DaVita patients, who visited the clinic to have their blood filtered.

They testified that they found 
Internet searches on Saenz's computer about bleach poisoning in blood 
and whether bleach could be detected in dialysis lines.

Saenz
 told the grand jury she had been concerned about the patients' deaths 
and looked up bleach poisoning references to see 'if this was happening,
 what would be the side effects'.

She was charged with one capital 
murder count accusing her of killing as many as five patients, and with 
five counts of aggravated assault for the injuries to the five other 
patients.

On the capital murder count, jurors could have found her guilty of the lesser charges of murder or aggravated assault.
