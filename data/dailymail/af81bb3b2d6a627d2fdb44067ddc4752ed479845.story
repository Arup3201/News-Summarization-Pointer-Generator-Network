Is she sorry? Katie Price apologised to Kelly Brook over topless picture but deleted the tweet just a few hours later

Their feud escalated when Katie Price posted a picture of Kelly Brook's bare breast but it seems that Jordan was sorry for her actions, even if her feelings or regret lasted only briefly.

The pregnant model and businesswoman, 34, apologised to Kelly, 33, on Twitter but has since deleted the post.

At around 10am on Saturday morning Katie wrote: '@IAMKELLYBROOK I'm really sorry for what I've done you know I think your a natural beautiful girl we go back a long way so I'm sorry xx.'

But the post was only up for a few hours before the model decided to delete it, seeming to have a change of hear.

The apology came after Katie took her row with Kelly to a whole new level on Friday when she tweeted a topless picture of her foe.

The mother-of-three posted a zoom in of a revealing shot of Kelly, taken from her St Barts holiday with then fiancé Billy Zane in 2008, after Ms Brook compared Katie to the infamous There's Something About Mary character Magda.

Kelly made the comparison between Katie and Magda during her debut as a team captain on Celebrity Juice on Thursday night.

Empty apology? Katie tweeted about how sorry she was and how the girls have known each other for a long time, but she deleted the tweet just a couple of hours after posting it

When asked by host Keith Lemon what 
she would do if Katie was there, she replied: 'What, Magda from There's 
Something About Mary?'

Magda was the fiftysomething, sun-worshipping next door neighbour of Cameron Diaz's character Mary in the hit 1998 comedy.

Played by actress Lin Shaye, she was known for her bleached blonde hair, permatan and caked on make-up... not unlike Katie.

The row between Katie and Kelly kicked off three weeks ago, when Katie accused the brunette model of looking heavier after seeing photos 
of her shooting her New Look swimwear campaign in Miami.

She wrote her column in The Sun: 'The pictures of Kelly modelling her 
latest New Look swimwear range in Miami don't seem to be airbrushed and 
I'm FLABbergasted to see how big Kelly really is.

'You're a heffer (sic), Kelly, but still a hot one.'

She
even suggested Kelly was 'comfort eating' because she was seeing her 
ex-boyfriend Danny Cipriani again - who was himself linked to Katie in 
October 2011.

Katie allegedly 'flipped out' after hearing of the pair's reunion sending her ex a series of angry text messages.

A source told Now magazine Katie told 
Danny he was 's**t in bed' and added 'Good luck with Kelly because 
she'll only dump you as soon as she gets bored again'.

Another source said Katie is 'obsessed' with Kelly, reportedly spending 
hours comparing images of herself and the Celebrity Juice star on 
Google.

Last month, Kelly said Katie was 'rude', adding: 'I actually wish her all the best. It's sad isn't it? I think it's a bit sad...

Reconciliation: Kelly and Danny are rumoured to be back together

Jealous? Katie and Danny dated briefly in October 2011

'I think girls can get away with having a bit of meat on our bones; I don’t mind a wobbly arm or a bit of cellulite.'

Both Kelly and Katie started glamour modelling around the same time in their teens, although their careers have gone fairly differently.

However, both have stripped off for Playboy - Kelly most recently in 2010 and Katie back in 2000.

A spokeswoman for Katie refused to comment when contacted by MailOnline.
