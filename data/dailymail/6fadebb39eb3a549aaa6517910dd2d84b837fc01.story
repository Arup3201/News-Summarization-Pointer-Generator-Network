A 43-year-old man has lost an astonishing 17st 8lb after the humiliation of getting wedged in a football ground turnstile made him rethink his unhealthy lifestyle.

Last year, Thomas McIntyre weighed 31st and his 74-inch waist was four inches greater than his height.

But since then he has won won Slimming World Man of the Year after
losing 17st 8lb - dropping from 31st to 13st 6lb. His waist 
has also shrunk from 40in to 34in.

Half the man he used to be: Thomas McIntyre, from Northern Ireland, has been crowned Slimming World's 'Slimmer of the Year' after losing more than half his body weight. Mr McIntyre admitted that his weight used to constantly worry him and he was convinced he would die young

Mr McIntyre admitted his weight used to constantly worry him and he was convinced he would die young.

He was on medication for high blood pressure, suffered breathing problems and fluid retention.

He said: 'I was the typical jolly fat bloke, always making fun of myself before anyone else had the chance to do it. 

'Deep down though I’d reached the point where I thought about my mortality all the time and the more I worried the more I ate, to comfort myself I suppose. It was a vicious cycle.' 

Couch potato: Mr McIntyre admitted that before he lost weight (pictured) he would spend his days off work on the sofa in front of the television. But since changing his lifestyle he now runs three times a week and walks his dogs

The big day: In the run up to his wedding five years ago, Mr McIntyre became so worried about his increasing weight that he secretly bought a bigger, back-up suit - it was an 8XL

The fresh food manager from Larne, Northern Ireland, saw his weight balloon after giving up football more than 20 years ago but without quitting the junk food his active lifestyle had allowed him to enjoy.

In the run up to his wedding five years ago, Mr McIntyre became so worried about his increasing weight that he secretly bought a bigger, back-up suit - it was an 8XL.

He said: 'My weight felt like a huge burden when I married my beautiful wife, Claire.

'She’s always loved me but getting a suit was difficult and I felt awful in it. 

'Getting stuck in a turnstile when I 
went to Patrick Thistle’s ground wasn’t much fun either, after that I 
had to go in through the disabled gate every time I went to a football 
game.'

He tried losing weight before and 
managed to shed 11st, but his diet left him hungry and he was unable to 
keep it off. He regained the weight plus another 3st, making him the 
biggest he’d ever been.

Mr McIntyre said that before joining Slimming World he had tried losing weight and managed to shed 11st. But his diet left him hungry and he was unable to keep the weight off. He regained the weight plus another 3 stone, making him the biggest he¿d ever been

In February last year, a friend confided in him how worried she was about his weight and asked him to come to their local Slimming World group with her. He said: 'I was extremely apprehensive. I was worried it would just be another failed diet attempt'. Since then, he said, his confidence has rocketed

In February last year a friend confided in him how worried she was about his weight and asked him to come to their local Slimming World group with her. 

He said: 'I was extremely apprehensive. I was worried it would just be another failed diet attempt, but that changed when I met my consultant, Jayson. 

'He’d lost  nine stone himself - although he looked like he’d never had a weight problem in his life - and after hearing his story and how passionate he was about helping other people to lose weight it made me feel like I could do it too.

'And when I came back after the first week and found out I’d lost 10.5lbs, I was completely won over.'

He began following Slimming World’s Food Optimising eating plan.

As
the weight came off, Mr McIntyre felt confident enough to begin 
exercising and he now runs three times a week as well as taking his dog 
on walks.

Mr McIntyre (pictured on holiday with with his wife Claire) had to enter through the disabled gate every time he went to a football match because he became too large to fit through the turnstile

Mr McIntyre said that since losing the weight his confidence has soared, he¿s learning to drive for the first time and is even hoping to start a family with his wife Claire (pictured)

However, the biggest change is in how
he feels about himself - his confidence is soaring, he’s learning to 
drive for the first time and is even hoping to start a family. 

He added: 'Before I joined Slimming World I had no energy, my days off would consist of me just lying on the sofa.

'Now
everything’s easier and I’m so much happier. If we are lucky enough to 
have children, I’ll be the active dad I always wanted to be and that’s 
really important to me.

'I feel like life passed me by for years so I’m determined to live it to the full now.

'I
can fit through the turnstiles when I go to the football now so there’s
no embarrassment there, in fact, that’s the only downside to my weight 
loss because I have to queue with everyone else.'
