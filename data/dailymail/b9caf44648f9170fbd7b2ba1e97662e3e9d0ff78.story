The internet has allowed us to take a closer look at each others' lives in a way that has never before been possible.

And now a new website has taken that ethos to an extreme, by providing a live feed of every single picture uploaded to photo-sharing service Instagram from five major cities.

The effect could be chillingly invasive - but instead, the stream of colourful images combine into a beautiful art project.

The site, called This Is Now, hosts Instagram feeds from New York, London, Sydney, Tokyo and Sao Paulo.

Each of the five versions shows a non-stop stream of the pictures taken by users of the app in the relevant city.

They use the geographical identification feature of Instagram to narrow down the appropriate pictures, only showing you picture from your chosen city.

The
 result is a unique window into the lives of some of the world's most 
vibrant cities, described as a constantly changing portrait of how residents see 
their world.

By Thursday night, 50,000 people had visited the site as it went viral.

However,
 notwithstanding the aesthetic appeal of the site, which was created by 
Australian company Lexical Gap, some will surely have privacy concerns.

Though
 the site is only taking information previously submitted publicly to Instagram, 
some users may not realise their photographs are so easily visible to 
the whole world.

Instagram fans may think they are only 
sharing pictures with their friends, but by using the app they are 
entrusting their personal information to a corporate giant - and 
publishing it to the web.

The site also gives a fascinating insight int the activities of each cities residents -for instance, London's stream is filled to the brim with Olympic pictures at the moment, while Japanese residents seem to prefer self portraits.

The Sydney firm behind the site described it as 'a visual composition which uses real-time updates from the ever popular Instagram application based on users geo-tag locations'.

'The tool streams photos instantly as soon as they are uploaded on Instagram and captures a cities movement, in a fluid story,' the firm said.

It also promised that more cities are coming to the service soon.

Instagram hit the headlines earlier this year when it was sold to Facebook for an astonishing $1 billion - although it has now emerged that Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom initially wanted $2billion for his start up.

According to an article in The Wall Street Journal, the major acquisition was handled in a markedly start-up way, with Mr Zuckerberg calling Mr Systrom on April 5 and asking for a meeting.

The two proceeded to spend 12-hour days ironing out the financial details not in a formal conference room of a corporate headquarters but in the comfort of Mr Zuckerberg’s $7million, five bedroom home in Palo Alto.

The move was a risky one: Instagram has generated zero profit in its two years of existence, but the 27-year-old billionaire saw it as filled with potential because of the rate at which it has grown.

Mr Zuckerberg raised the question of whether Facebook would eventually become a company like Google- which is valued at $200billion- or would it stick closer to the projections that place Facebook’s initial public offering valuation at $100billion.

At the end of the three day negotiations, Mr Systrom agreed to a deal that amounts to roughly $1billion in Facebook stock.

By day three, when they were about to sign off on the final details, the two men alerted their respective boards and investors. The troops rounded up quickly, and in the case of Facebook they held a vote.

Despite of the seemingly democratic method, the vote was largely symbolic because Mr Zuckerberg has enough clout to make it go through with his voting shares even if he did not have their support.

Mr Zuckerberg was clearly happy with his investment and, appropriately, he decided to share his satisfaction.

‘This is an important milestone for Facebook because it's the first time we've ever acquired a product and company with so many users,’ he wrote on his Facebook wall, referencing Instagram’s approximate 35 million users.

‘We don't plan on doing many more of these, if any at all. But providing the best photo sharing experience is one reason why so many people love Facebook and we knew it would be worth bringing these two companies together.’

A day after posting about the deal on Facebook, he took to Instagram, displaying a photo of his Hungarian Puli puppy Beast.
