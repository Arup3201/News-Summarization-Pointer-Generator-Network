Tragedy: George Tyson, 61, died after pushing his son out of the way

A selfless father was killed by a road sign after he pushed his disabled son out of the way of an 'out of control car', a court heard.

George Tyson, 61, had been taking a walk with his son Garry, 32, when his throat was cut open by a Give Way sign.

Teenager Jamie Skelton, 18, is accused of losing control of his car on a street corner and sending the sign flying into the carpenter's neck.

The driver, who was 17 at the time of the incident, is charged with causing death by dangerous driving.

Skelton, an apprentice engineer, allegedly drove at 'excessive speed' and careered backwards at about 50mph on to the pavement near Mr Tyson's home in Ulverston, Cumbria, the Daily Mirror reported.

Preston Crown Court heard Skelton's Vauxhall Corsa knocked the pole down, but he continued backwards over it and the sign was caught up in the car's wheels before it was flung out, slashing Mr Tyson's carotid artery.

Just before he was hit, he had pushed his son Garry, who has cerebral palsy, out of the way of the car.

Prosecuter Arthur Gibson said that this was caused because Skelton's car was 'out of control'.

George Tyson died at the scene of the incident on the A5087 at Bardsea in January of last year, when he was out walking with his 32-year-old son

He said the sign was 'was flung out like a metal frisbee or boomerang,' the Westmorland Gazette reported.

Mr Gibson accused Skelton, who denies the charge, of heading out to test the car's limits.

He said: 'He was going to see what the car could do, perhaps to pretend he was a rally driver, driving at fast and excessive speeds, a pattern of driving that would lead to terrible and tragic consequences.'

Mr Tyson died from his horrific injuries on the A5087 at Bardsea in January, last year.

Skelton, of Barrow, Cumbria, pleaded not guilty to death by dangerous driving.

The trial continues.
