The first notable solar flare of 2015 has been spotted on the sun, Nasa has said.

An image of the event shows the powerful burst of radiation on the surface.

This particular flare is not thought to be any threat to Earth - but does that not stop the burst still looking mightily impressive.

This image released by Nasa shows the sun emitting a mid-level solar flare, peaking at 4:24am GMT today (11:24pm EST yesterday). Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, but when intense enough they can disturb the atmosphere

The mid-level flare was emitted by the sun and peaked this morning at 4:24am GMT (11:24pm EST yesterday).

It was captured by Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, which watches the sun constantly.

This particular event was classified as an M5.6-class flare.

M-class flares are a tenth the size of the most intense flares, the X-class flares.

The number provides more information about its strength. An M2 is twice as intense as an M1, an M3 is three times as intense, and so on.

Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation, but harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth’s atmosphere and physically affect humans on the ground.

However, when intense enough, they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.

Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), illustration shown, was launched on 11 February 2010 and has observed the sun ever since. It’s goal is to understand how exactly the sun interacts with the environment around Earth. It captured the images of this morning's mid-level flare

Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost.

The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field.

Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies.

A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced.

Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. 

A solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots.

Their frequency varies from several a day, when the sun is particularly active, to less than one a week during quiet periods.

Radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves at the long wavelength end, through optical emission to x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end.

The amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100-megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time.

Solar flares are not to be confused with coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

The former are the flash of light from the sun, while the latter are the actual emission of material that we often see as 'loops' coming from the surface.

While the two often accompany each other, the relationship between them is not entirely understood.
