Dashing from the beauty salon, Claudia Winkleman didn’t have time to grab her dancing shoes.

But going barefoot meant she could show off an impressive set of twinkletoes.

The new host of Strictly Come Dancing, 42, was too rushed to let her nail varnish dry – or take out the beautician’s cotton wool from between her toes – as she prepared for the red carpet launch of the show last night.

Spotted ahead of her appearance with this year’s celebrities, Miss Winkleman looked a tad dishevelled in skinny jeans and an untucked shirt as she tip-toed to a taxi juggling several bags.

But by the time she appeared at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, where the show is filmed, the transformation was complete.

She had swapped her casual get-up for a sequined black dress, while she had tamed her hair into a sleek, shiny style.

However, it is not known whether her toes were equally immaculate after their encounter with a wet pavement.

Contestant Judy Murray turned heads at last night’s event in a striking red dress that showed off her back.

The 54-year-old will be joined by celebrities including pop star Pixie Lott, 23, MasterChef host Gregg Wallace, 49, and Bargain Hunt frontman Tim Wonnacott, 61.

While former Strictly host Sir Bruce Forsyth was known for opening shows with a dance routine, Miss Winkleman has admitted her skills are not up to those of her predecessor.

‘It’s my knees,’ she said. ‘I can’t dance and speak at the same time. It will finish me off.’

This is the first year the show will be hosted by an all-female duo after the departure of Sir Bruce Forsyth
