Manchester City's next Champions League match away to CSKA Moscow will be played behind closed doors.

UEFA have imposed a three-match supporter ban at CSKA's home matches and hit the Russian club with  a substantial fine of around £155,000 after their fans clashed with police and threw flares in the opening Group E game in Italy against Roma last month.

CSKA had already been punished over two incidents of racist chanting in last season's competition, including abuse aimed at City midfielder Yaya Toure when the two clubs met a year ago.

CSKA's last Champions League game - against Bayern Munich on Tuesday - was  played behind closed doors

Supporters were banned because of CSKA fans' bad behaviour at the away match with Roma

After CSKA played their second group game against Bayern Munich in an empty stadium earlier this week, supporters will once again be barred from attending the tie against City on October 21. 

The Premier League champions had delayed selling tickets for the game in anticipation of Friday's decision.

Earlier Manuel Pellegrini said that he would prefer not to play behind closed doors after seeing City take just one point from their opening two games.

City could only draw 1-1 with Roma on Tuesday as Francesco Totti scored this delightful equaliser

'My personal thinking is football should always be with fans,' he said. 'I don' t think it is good to play in an empty stadium, not good for anyone.

'I understand a local team have a little (something) with their fans but all the people deserve to go to the stadium. I don't know what will happen.'

The Russian club's fans will also be banned from attending the return clash with City at the Etihad Stadium on November 5.
