Three in 10 Americans believe that a 'secretive power elite' is conspiring to rule the world through an authoritarian government and one in five Republicans believes President Obama is the 'anti-Christ,' according to a survey of the nation's most popular conspiracy theories. 

The strange beliefs, which range from the serious (that the U.S. government knowingly allowed the 9/11 terrorist attacks to happen), to the comical (that the Beatles' Paul McCartney died in 1966 and was secretly replaced), the survey by Public Policy Polling shows there is no end to what some people will believe.

The theory on the terrorist attacks is supported by 11 percent of the survey's respondents, while another 11 percent said 'not sure' about whether the government was involved in the national tragedy.

Conspiracy theories: Three in 10 people are convinced that aliens exist and one in five believe that a UFO crashed in Roswell, N.M. in 1947, according to a new survey

Fewer people - just 5 percent - said they believe in the Paul McCartney theory. 

But three in 10 people are convinced that aliens exist and one in five believe that a UFO crashed in Roswell, N.M. in 1947. 

On global warming, PPP found that 58 percent of Republicans believe it is a hoax, while 77 percent of Democrats disagree. 

Additionally, more than half of Americans agree that there was a larger conspiracy at work in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and only a quarter believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

And less than half of Americans think that former President George W. Bush lied about the possibility of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in order to promote the war.

'Even crazy conspiracy theories are subject to partisan polarization, especially when there are political overtones involved,' said Dean Debnam, president of Public Policy Polling. 'But most Americans reject the wackier ideas out there about fake moon landings and shape-shifting lizards.'

Less popular theories: Five percent of people believe that the Beatles' Paul McCartney died in a car accident in 1966 and was secretly replaced

(Only 7 percent believe the moon landing was fake and just 4 percent believe that 'shape-shifting reptilian people control our world by taking on human form and gaining political power to manipulate our societies.')

The polling firm surveyed 1,247 registered voters via telephone from March 27th to March 30th. The survey has a 2.8 percent margin of error.

Thirty-eight percent of respondents identified themselves as Democrats while 34 percent called themselves Republicans and the others fell into the 'Independent/Other' category.
