A fireman marches through the still smouldering trees and darkly scorched earth in a scene reminiscent of the aftermath of an Australian bush fire.

Elsewhere, flames and billowing smoke rise from what looks like a battlefield and paint the night sky.

These extraordinary pictures tell the story of a nation in the grip of drought yesterday – Britain’s hottest day of the year so far – when the tinder-dry conditions suddenly erupted in a series of wildfires.

The devastation comes as the Environment Agency today declared more areas as being officially in drought, following another dry month which has hit rivers and groundwater supplies.

Under control: A fireman walks across devastated scrubland in Newport, Wales. The blaze is believed to have been started by arsonists

Under control: Firemen extinguish flames at Brookwood cemetery in Surrey - the cause is still unknown

Inferno: The night sky is lit up by a blaze along the Scottish border destroying more than 100 acres. Crews battled for more than 12 hours to put it out

In Newport, South Wales, flames raged across 15 acres of scrubland, coming just yards from homes.

Terrified residents were forced to use garden  hose pipes to keep away the blaze, which at times licked their properties.

Firemen battled for more than five 
hours to control the fire, which is believed to have been started by 
arsonists near a children’s park.

Another blaze raged yesterday over 17 acres of the 500-acre Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey, where more than 235,000 people have been buried since 1854.

More than 40 firefighters tackled the flames as fire chiefs warned that the lack of rain and tinder box dry conditions in the South East were the 'perfect recipe' for wildfires.

A Surrey Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said today that no properties were affected by the blaze, which was brought under control by around 4pm, two hours after it started.

He could not comment on the amount of damage caused to the cemetery - the largest in Britain - and the cause of the fire is unknown.

Six fire engines, a water tanker and specialist off-road vehicles were drafted in to attack the flames from different areas, the fire service said.

Unbelievable: Firefighters battled for hours in both Newport and Risca yesterday to bring the grass fires under control

Fire service area manager Alan Clark 
said wildfires were notoriously difficult to control, adding: 'These 
fires cause devastation to the countryside, wildlife and property.

'They pose a risk to life, both to the public and the firefighters tackling these blazes.'

Each year, there are around 79,000 wildfires in the UK - an average of 216 per day.

Brookwood Cemetery was consecrated by
 the Bishop of Winchester on November 7, 1854, and opened to the public 
six days later. At the time, it was believed to be the largest burial 
ground in the world.

Surrey County Council leader David Hodge said: 'These blazes can start for all sorts of reasons. A moment of carelessness could result in devastation to the countryside and lives being put at risk.'

As temperatures hit 23c (73f) 
yesterday, a third fire broke out at St Mary’s Loch in the Scottish 
borders, destroying more than 100 acres. Crews battled for more than 12 
hours to put it out.

Meanwhile, firefighters were returning to the hills above Harrogate, North Yorkshire, today after they spent yesterday afternoon tackling a large moor fire.

Crews from as far away as Tadcaster and neighbouring West Yorkshire were brought in to tackle the blaze on Hanging Moor, above the village of Thruscross, shortly before 2pm.

Blaze: And in Scotland a huge grass fire broke out at the foot of Criffel, Galloway, on the northern side of the Solway Firth

Epic: Hundreds of acres of grass and heather has been burning out of control since yesterday on hills overlooking the Solway Firth. In this picture on the right a house stands perilously close to the flames

Burning: The blaze could be seen for miles around and across the Solway in Cumbria. More than 30 firefighters and workers were called to Drumburn Hill between New Abbey and Kirkbean

A spokeswoman for North Yorkshire 
Fire Service said a large number of firefighters were needed 'due to the
 actual vastness of the moor' and it was burning over three different 
fronts.

One front is thought to be 200m long.

The spokeswoman said there were five different seats of fire identified. One crew was left monitoring the blaze overnight.

This morning, she said: 'This fire is
 still burning and will continue to for some days. A cause has not yet 
been confirmed but further details will be supplied during the next few 
days.'

A moorland fire in Edenfield, Lancashire, was also under control today following an early morning inspection.

Crews from Lancashire and Greater Manchester were called to the blaze off Rochdale Road, near Scout Moor Wind Farm, at about 5pm yesterday.

They were confronted with a number of separate pockets of fire covering two square miles in what was described as a 'very large' blaze.

Water firm United Utilities also provided specialist all-terrain vehicles to access remote parts of the areas affected, said Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service.

Firefighters were withdrawn at 7pm due to fading light after they were satisfied that no property or livestock was at risk.

A fire service spokeswoman confirmed the blaze had dissipated when crews returned at 5.30am today to reassess the situation.

Drought spreads to Yorkshire, Sheffield and Hull

Swathes of East and South Yorkshire from Chesterfield up to Scarborough are officially suffering from drought, with areas around Sheffield, Doncaster, Hull and Driffield affected.

The areas join the South East and eastern England in drought, most of which has been affected since earlier this year, although parts of East Anglia have been suffering drought conditions since last summer.

Earlier this month, seven water companies across east and southern England announced hosepipe bans would come into force before Easter in a bid to conserve water supplies in the face of two unusually dry winters.

But while the rivers Don, Rother, Hull and Derwent are at low or very low levels for the time of year, the Environment Agency said public water supplies were unlikely to be affected in the region.

Yorkshire Water - which serves 4.7million customers - said it did not anticipate any restrictions such as hosepipe bans at the moment.

The company said its reservoirs were at 94 per cent, which was normal for the time of year, but groundwater levels in East Yorkshire were around a fifth below usual levels.

As a result, the amount of water being taken from aquifers had been reduced and Hull’s water supply was being supported by water drawn from the River Derwent.

Location: The fire spread easily, across 15 acres between Comfrey Close, in Allt-yr-yn, and Barrack Hill, known locally as Barracks Wood, towards the TA barracks

In a statement, the company said: 'As
 the dry weather continues, we will be keeping the local water resource 
situation under constant review.

'Our regional water supply system 
gives us flexibility, what it doesn’t give us is an unlimited supply of 
water, so we would always encourage our customers to only use what they 
need, when they need it.'

Some parts of Yorkshire have seen the
 driest 12 months since 1910 and river levels are continuing to fall, 
prompting the Environment Agency to urge farmers and businesses taking 
water from rivers to use supplies wisely.

Trevor Bishop, head of water 
resources, said: 'Today, south and east Yorkshire have moved into 
official drought status, reflecting the impact that this extremely dry 
period is having on the environment in the area.

'The Environment Agency must balance 
the water needs of people, farmers, businesses and the environment and 
we are working with businesses, farmers and water companies to plan 
ahead to meet the challenges of a continued drought.'

The news of drought conditions 
spreading to Yorkshire comes after the Environment Agency warned that 
drought would affect more parts of the country without well-above 
average rainfall in the coming weeks.

And in its latest update last week, 
the agency said England and Wales had experienced another dry week, and 
in addition to areas in drought parts of the south west and Midlands 
were also experiencing dry conditions.

The outlook for Wales remained normal, although an exceptionally dry spring and summer could see that change, the EA warned.

The Environment Agency has had to 
take steps to protect wildlife in the face of drought, including staging
 a fish rescue from the River Welland in Lincolnshire this week, moving 
fish threatened by low water levels to another, deeper part of the 
river.

The news of the drought spreading 
comes as the Environment Department (Defra) launched a campaign to raise
 public awareness of the connection between the health of England’s 
rivers and people’s water use.

Environment Minister Richard Benyon 
said: 'It’s especially important that we care for our rivers when 
they’re facing the added pressure of drought, as well as the constant 
threats they face from over-use and pollution.

'The fact that so many organisations 
have come together to back this campaign shows the depth of feeling 
about this issue, and the importance we all place on making sure our 
actions don’t damage our rivers.'

Paul Wilkinson, head of Living 
Landscape for The Wildlife Trusts, said: 'The amazing wildlife of our 
rivers and wetlands is under immense pressure from drought and other 
factors.

'Many of us would like to help but 
don’t know what action to take. There are simple steps around water use 
that can make a real difference including turning off taps when cleaning
 our teeth.'

Hosepipe bans – due to start on April
 5 – have already been imposed by seven water companies in the south and
 east of England, affecting 20million customers.

Yorkshire Water is one of six firms 
which failed to meet leakage reduction targets set by the regular Ofwat 
last year, along with Anglian Water and Southern water.
