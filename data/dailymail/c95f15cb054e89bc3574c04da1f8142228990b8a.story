Summer-themed plastic surgery promotions continue to put patients at risk in defiance of a Government review calling for them to be banned.

Deals promising patients ‘a beach-ready body’ if they go under the knife this month are still being sold, despite recommendations designed to protect patients from dangerous procedures by NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh.

A number of leading surgeons have also backed this newspaper’s Ban The Cosmetic Surgery Cowboys campaign, which aims to outlaw the promotions.

But a study has found more than half of the most popular cosmetic surgery companies are still offering promotional deals.

Of those, 37 per cent urged patients to book quickly or miss out. None provided the recommended written consent ‘cooling off’ process.

The ‘unethical’ practices have now been criticised by the main professional bodies involved in standards, including the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) and the British Association of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.

BAAPS council member Kevin Hancock said: ‘This type of marketing pressures patients to have operations they should be making informed decisions about, instead of rushing into on a spur-of-the-moment whim.’
