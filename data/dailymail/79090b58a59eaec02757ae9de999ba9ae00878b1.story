Millions of besotted cat owners are so keen to stay in touch with  their
 pets that they use their mobile phone or computer to call home and 
‘speak’ to them. 

One in three use video messaging service Skype to see and give them attention, a poll of 1,000 owners claims.

Almost a quarter of male owners admit they’ll even call home just to hear their feline friend purring - more than the number of women who do.

Concentration: With cats so domesticated, it's no surprise their owners want to hear their 'voice'

Ignoring
 the fact that cats only offer affection on their terms, half of British
 owners say they’d rather spend time with one than with a human.

When
 owners and pets do spend quality time together it’s clear what they get
 up to. For 37 per cent of men say they have taught their cat to perform
 tricks, the poll for card retailer Hallmark shows.

So it’s no surprise that 29 per cent of women say their cat is a fully-fledged member of the family.

The poll found a fifth of cats are taken on family holidays and 15 per cent of owners confess to serving their cat specially-made meals on a daily basis.

Perhaps the most bizarrely, U.S. film star Angelina Jolie was crowned the biggest cat lookalike with almost 70 per cent of owners claiming that their cat is like the actress - 'sexy, sinuous and just a little bit dangerous'.
