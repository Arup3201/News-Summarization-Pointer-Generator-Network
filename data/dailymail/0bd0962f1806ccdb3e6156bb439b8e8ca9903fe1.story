It's the whizzy invention scientists say can conjure up anything from chess pieces and toy cars to bones, guns and guitars.

Now researchers working on the 3D printer have set their sights on revolutionising home cooking – with the launch of the first food printer.

The so-called Foodini, which they say combines ‘technology, food, art and design’, can be used to make anything from chocolate fingers to ravioli.

Basics: The dough for the pizza is printed out using the machine. Foodini can create savoury or sweet cuisine made from real food and fresh ingredients

The machine is expected to go on sale priced at £835 in mid-2014, and needs to be loaded with capsules filled with fresh ingredients.

It is is operated by a touch-screen mini tablet that functions as the user interface embedded on the front of the device.

Users can then select a design and the food is ‘printed’ as the different ingredients are built up in layers.

Natural Machines, the company behind the idea, has suggested that parents could use the device to design meals in the shape of animals or cartoon characters – or surprise a loved one by customising a message that could be printed on top of a cake. 

The new kitchen processor is about to revolutionise cooking, by letting you make your favourite dishes using a 3D food printer

Firm co-founder Lynette Kucsma, a 
former PR manager for Microsoft, sad 'Foodini takes on the difficult parts of 
making food that is hard and/or time consuming to make fully by hand. 
One of our goals is to streamline some of cooking's more repetitive 
activities - forming dough into breadsticks, or filling and forming 
individual ravioli - to encourage more people to eat healthy, homemade 
foods.

'Choose your 
recipe from our online recipe site, or create your own. Then let Foodini
 do the hard part. You prepare and load the fresh ingredients, and 
Foodini will create the dish. Depending on the recipe, the food is 
either ready to eat after Foodini is done, such as a chocolate dessert, 
or you'll need to finish cooking the dish prior to eating, like 
ravioli.'

Ready for use: Firm co-founder Lynette Kucsma, a former PR manager for Microsoft, revealed that they are hoping to make family homes and restaurants their top market

The firm co-founder said: 'Retail food stores have shown an interest. They can both print food in-store to sell to consumers as well as sell pre-filled food capsules for consumers to take home to use in their machines'

She says the machine will allow people to have fun with food by creating their own recipes.

She
 explains: 'We printed two sets of burgers. In the pictures, the square 
burgers are vegetarian bean burgers, with white beans, lentils, onion 
and herbs. The two small round burgers are meat burgers, made with pork 
meat, beef, parmiggiano, walnut, red berry jam, salt and peppe

She also revealed that they are hoping to make 
family homes and restaurants their top market.

 said: ‘Retail food stores have shown an interest. They can both print 
food in-store to sell to consumers as well as sell pre-filled food 
capsules for consumers to take home to use in their machines.

Ready: The machine arrives ready for use, so-called plug and play, and is operated by a touch-screen mini tablet that functions as the user interface embedded on the front of the device

Faster food: The machine also produces printed cheeseburgers

Lynette Kucsma, co-founder of the Barcelona-based comapny said 'We printed two sets of burgers. In the pictures, the square burgers are vegetarian bean burgers, with white beans, lentils, onion and herbs'

‘It could be an option to buy pre-filled capsules, put them in the machine and print.’

However a spokesman for the Barcelona-based company pointed out that the Foodini still has several limitations.

He
 said: ‘Foodini does not automate all your cooking, nor does it cook 
food. If necessary, it can keep food warm as it works as it contains a 
heating element.’

He added: ‘Making your own food and knowing all of the ingredients is obviously better.

‘But it does require more time from you in the kitchen versus opening a bag or a box of something that is processed, frozen or already prepared.

‘Foodini can design food into different shapes, make a quiche in the shape of a dinosaur, create pictures with sauces that kids can fill in with veggies or write messages on pieces of toast for breakfast.

‘You could also make food more visually appealing by adding an intricate topping to a cupcake. Who says food always has to be a serious affair?’

Many talents: Liquorice is just one of the foods that the 3D printer can make

A printed chocolate xmas tree is also one of the shapes that the printer can create

Festive themed: A chocolate snowflake is also another one of the products produced by the machine
