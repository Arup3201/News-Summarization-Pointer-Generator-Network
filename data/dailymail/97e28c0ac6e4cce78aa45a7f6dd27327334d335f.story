Nicolas Sarkozy today voted in an election which is on course to see him replaced as President of France by Socialist candidate Francois Hollande.

Both men appeared at polling booths in their respective constituencies, but it was Mr Hollande who looked by far the most confident.

The last opinion surveys published on Friday suggested that he is cruising to victory by at least five percentage points.

Sarkozy, in contrast, looked tired and
drawn as he arrived at a voting station in Paris’s upmarket 16th 
arrondissement, along with his wife, Carla Bruni.

The former supermodel dominated the 
occasion, smiling broadly at the cameras and leading her ashen-faced 
husband behind a curtain to place their votes.

Sarkozy then headed without commenting
to the Elysee Palace for possibly the last time, while Carla returned 
to her nearby town house, to be with the couple’s baby daughter, Giulia.

Hollande, meanwhile, said he was 
looking forward to a hearty lunch in his Tulle constituency in central 
France, along with his partner, Valerie Trierweiler.

The menu for the man nicknamed 
‘Flanby’, after a popular creme caramel pudding, included magret de 
canard, beef, strawberry pie, and local red wines.

By midday, on a cold, grey Sunday, voter turnout was  just over 30 per cent, lower than 34 per cent  in 2007.

The last poll on Friday, by 
Ifop-Fiducial, had Hollande winning by 52-48 percent as Sarkozy 
insisted: ‘Everything is possible on Sunday’.

Hollande won the first round of the 
election two weekends ago, with 28.63 percent of the votes, compared to 
27.18 percent for Sarkozy.

Since then, Sarkozy has desperately 
been trying to win over some six million voters who backed far right 
National Front candidate Marine Le Pen.

At his last rally on Friday in the 
southern city of Toulon, Sarkozy repeated his view that there are ‘too 
many immigrants in France’ and that ‘integration was not working’.

Hollande said he wanted a clear win so that his left-wing programme would have a clear mandate.

It includes a top tax rate of 75 per cent, increased wealth taxes, and the creation of thousands of new public service jobs.

He says he ‘dislikes the rich’ and had already singled out ‘the world of finance’ as his principal enemy.

A Hollande win is likely to see a huge
influx of wealthy French people into the UK, as those who fear sky-high
taxes leave their own country.

Estate agents in London are already reported increased interest in properties from clients from the other side of the Channel.

‘I want an ample victory,’ said 
Hollande . ‘If the French people must make a choice, they should do so 
clearly, overwhelmingly, so the winner has the capacity and means to 
act.

Sarkozy’s best hope of being 
re-elected involved winning the support of around 80 percent of Le Pen’s
votes and at least half of Bayrou's.

But Bayrou, who came fifth in the 
first round with nine percent of the vote, said: ‘The line Nicolas 
Sarkozy chose between the two rounds is violent. It contradicts our 
values.’

Defeat for Sarkozy will mean he will 
become the first president since Valery Giscard d'Estaing in 1981 to 
fail in a re-election bid.

Polling stations are open from 8am 
until 7pm today, with projected results based on a partial vote count 
published as soon as the last polling stations closes.

Whoever wins the election will be sworn in as a new president at the Elysee Palace two weeks later.
