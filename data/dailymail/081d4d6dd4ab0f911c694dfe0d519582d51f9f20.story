She's at the centre of one of the most talked-about celebrity scandals of the century.

But Lauren Silverman did her utmost to take her mind off her situation over the weekend, as she headed out for a spot of retail therapy.

The 36-year-old socialite, who is expecting a baby with music mogul Simon Cowell, wore a fitted yellow minidress as she was joined by her sister and son Adam as the group browsed the local shops in Bridgehampton, New York.

Lauren's outing came as Cowell headed to St Tropez, where he is expected to spend the next month alongside ex-girlfriends including Sinitta, Terri Seymour and Jackie St Clair, as well as former fiancée Mezhgan Hussainy.

The X Factor supremo, 53, will 
tour Europe and take time to evaluate how exactly to proceed after it 
was revealed last week that New York socialite Lauren - married to his 
friend Andrew - is expecting his baby.

Ironically,
it was on board the $458,000-a-week Slipstream that Cowell was pictured
sharing a tender embrace with Lauren last August, in images that came 
to light over the weekend.

Despite the St Tropez trip, Cowell is also expected to fly to 
Britain within the next few days to meet up with his 87-year-old mother Julie and brother 
Nick to discuss the pregnancy and his plans for the future.

A friend of Cowell’s said: ‘They are both worried about the situation and want to see him face to face.'

Julie previously expressed her delight over the pregnancy, saying: 'If it's true then I'm absolutely delighted.

'He'll make a fantastic father. He'll be great.'

Prior to heading to St Tropez, Cowell
was seen taking his mind off the drama in his personal life by 
attending a One Direction concert in Las Vegas on Saturday night.

The 53-year-old was spotted mingling 
with fans, standing alongside a male friend, as he stood in the audience
and watched his X Factor stars perform in the city.

But as Cowell spent his weekend in 
Vegas before jetting off to France, his lover Lauren was seen in the 
Hamptons, where she is believed to have been attempting to come to an 'amicable resolution' with her estranged husband Andrew over their divorce,  according to one source.

The couple want to make their seven-year-old son Adam their main priority, the source said.

'Andrew stayed at the house to create some normalcy for their son,' a source told The New York Post.

'There was no talk about the divorce
settlement. That is being handled by the lawyers. There was minimal 
conversation between them. It was done purely for their child.'

However, the divorce is said to 
have taken a nasty turn because Andrew is 'p*****' by rumours that he 
knew about Cowell's relationship with his wife all along.

A
friend close to the real estate developer said that the idea that he 
knew about his wife's relationship with Cowell is 'ridiculous' and 'she 
knows this isn't true.'

Lauren's accusations that her husband
messed around, partying with girls all over the world, is only adding 
fuel to their bitter custody battle over son Adam.

Andrew's friend said that it sounds like a 'desperate attempt to smear him.'

The statement was in response to an earlier TMZ report that said Andrew knew about the affair all along.

They said Lauren was 'outraged' that when he feigned shock at pictures of the Hamptons socialite kissing Simon on a yacht last year.

The website reported that Lauren has alleged to close friends that Andrew 'knew what was going on the whole time and he was doing the same thing.'

While Lauren's pregnancy is still in early days, Cowell is said to be concerned about the strain the situation and publicity could put on the socialite.

The
pair are in a relationship, as MailOnline revealed this week, but 
another friend said: 'At the moment, Lauren and Andrew need to thrash 
out their divorce - Lauren can't just go running off to be with Simon, 
as much as she wants to be with him.

'All sides want the divorce to go through as quickly as can be.'

It remains to be seen just how the 
news that he is to be a father will go down with Cowell, who has never 
made a secret of the fact that he doesn't believe he is the right 
material to become a parent.

In an interview in 2009, Cowell said: 'God, no. I couldn't have children. If I had them here drawing on the walls I'd go nuts.

'With
kids, you've got a routine you can't escape from. You've got to be up 
at a certain time. Got to listen. When all you want to do is sit in a 
corner thinking.'

However,
in a more recent interview in April this year, Cowell appeared to have 
somewhat changed his mind, saying: 'I haven’t ruled it out. If I knew I 
could be - how do I put this delicately - faithful, I would.

'I do like kids, I’m just not sure I’d 
be any good for the first six months. I don’t think I’d adopt because 
I’d rather have my own. I’d have to say I’d like a little girl.'
