ISIS has released images of their fighters engaging in street fighting in Kobane today, the latest dispatch from their slick publicity machine.

The pictures, distributed by the media office in the ISIS 'capital' of Raqqa in Syria, show jihadis firing rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles in the ruined streets of the town.

The eyes of the world have been on Kobane, where weeks of fighting have taken place within full view of the Turkish border.

Islamic State militants have taken hundreds of Kurds captive over the past year as part of the group's brutal campaign to take over predominantly Kurdish areas of northern and eastern Syria

The town has become a symbolic test of the U.S.-led coalition's ability to halt the advance of ISIS, which has poured weapons and fighters into its assault of the town that has lasted more than a month.

Meanwhile, Islamic State militants tortured and abused Kurdish children captured earlier this year near the  town of Kobane, according to an international rights group.

Human Rights Watch based its conclusions on interviews with several children who were among more than 150 Kurdish boys from Kobane abducted in late May as they were returning home after taking school exams in the city of Aleppo.

It said around 50 of the Kurds escaped early in their captivity, while the rest were released in batches - the last on October 29.

'Since the beginning of the Syrian uprising, children have suffered the horrors of detention and torture, first by the Assad government and now by Isis,' said Human Rights Watch spokesman Fred Abrahams.

Four of the children who were released said they were held by the extremists in the northern Syrian town of Manbij. They described abuse at the hands of the militants, who used an electric cable to administer beatings.

'This evidence of torture and abuse of children by ISIS underlines why no-one should support their criminal enterprise.'

Four of the children who were released told Human Rights Watch that they were held by the extremists in the northern Syrian town of Manbij. They described frequent abuse at the hands of the militants, who used a hose and electric cable to administer beatings.

The boys said some of the worst abuse was reserved for captives who had family members in the Kurdish militia known as the YPG, which has been locked in heavy fighting with Islamic State militants for control of Kobane since mid-September. 

Today it also emerged ISIS militants have publicly shot dead 36 Sunni tribesmen, women and children, pushing the number of members slain by the extremists in recent days to more than 200.

Sheik Naim al-Gaoud, a senior figure in the Al Bu Nimr tribe, said the militant group killed 29 men, four women and three children, lining them up in in the village of Ras al-Maa, north of Ramadi in Anbar province. He said the extremists shot each of them dead one by one.

The tribal leader warned that 120 families were still trapped there.

'These massacres will be repeated in the coming days unless the government and its security forces help the trapped people,' Mr al-Gaoud said.

Some Sunnis in Anbar province supported the militants when they seized Fallujah and parts of Ramadi in December. That came after widespread Sunni protests against the Shiite-led government in Baghdad for what they described as second-class treatment.

These recent slayings, all committed in public, raise the death toll suffered by the Sunni Al Bu Nimr tribe in recent days at the hands of the Islamic State group to at least 214 tribal members killed.

Analysts believe the Islamic State group may be trying to take revenge for the tribe siding with the American forces in the past, as well as Iraqi security forces.

The killings will also likely terrify other Sunni tribes that would think of resisting the militants.

Since the Islamic State group's offensive, a number of Iraq's Sunni tribes have been fundamental in stalling its advance, taking up arms and fighting alongside Iraqi security forces.

A U.S.-led campaign of airstrikes is targeting the group as well, with nine strikes hitting its fighters yesterday and today in Beiji, Fallujah and Ar Rutbah, U.S. Central Command said.
