The discovery of a graphic sex video filmed inside a fire station has ended the 19-year-career of a veteran Florida fireman. 

Lt. Stephen Coward resigned last month after video evidence and emails became available showing he'd been using Clearwater Fire Station 51 for rendezvous with women other than his wife.

Clearwater City Spokesman Rob Shaw said upon hearing of the evidence; 'We began an investigation immediately and tried to figure out what happened.'

Coward admitted to acting inappropriately, and said he had sex with the woman in both the dive truck and the weight room.

WFLA reports the footage shows Coward inside the bathroom of his firehouse dormitory room engaging in intercourse with an unidentified woman. 

In the video, he is smiling and holding up a cell phone in the mirror. 

The Clearwater fire chief received a flash drive containing the video and 40 emails on August 6th. 

Shaw told WFTS a letter contained in the package urged the city to investigate.

Yet another anonymous tipster came forward to tell authorities Coward had been with as many as eight different women while on the job. 

Clearwater City Spokesman Rob Shaw said the evidence was sent to the city by an anonymous tipster

Among the list of Coward's paramours is an elementary school teacher, an ex-girlfriend, and an ex-girlfriend of a colleague. 

Coward admitted to acting inappropriately, and said he had sex with the woman in both the dive truck and the weight room.

He also told city leaders no one in the fire department knew about his behavior.
