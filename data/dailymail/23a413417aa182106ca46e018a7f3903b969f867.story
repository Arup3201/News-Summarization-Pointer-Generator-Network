People continue to line up at Martin Place two days after a tragic siege that rocked Sydney ended in a hail of bullets and the tragic death of two hostages.

The sea of flowers outside the Lindt Cafe continues to grow as mourners lay bunches of flowers, write tributes on the pavement and say prayers for not just mother-of-three Katrina Dawson and cafe manager Tori Johnson, but for all the victims of the act of terrorism carried out by Islamic extremist Man Haron Monis.

Among Wednesday's crowd were hostage survivor Harriette Denny and her partner, as well as the family of Mr Johnson, 34, who died after trying to wrestle the gun off Monis.

Monis also died following a stand off with police that lasted almost 17 hours.

The mood on Wednesday was sombre amid mounting anger over the national security system's failure to flag gunman Man Haron Monis for surveillance, despite his long history of violence and mental instability.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that he has serious questions about why the 'madman' was not on any counter-terrorism watch list.

'The system did not adequately deal with this individual,' he said.

'Two very decent people are dead, others are injured, others are traumatised because of a madman who was roaming our streets.' 

Tori Johnson's employees left a handwritten note, a bouquet of flowers and Lindt chocolates among the thousands of tributes that have now taken over Martin Place

NSW police have urged Sydneysiders to go about their business as usual.

'We see the fear in their eyes and we want to let them know that we are out there to know they are safe,' Assistant Commissioner Mick Fuller said on Wednesday.

Police have re-opened the exclusion zone in Martin Place. 

Mr Abbott intends to publish a report into the lead-up to Monday's siege and how and where Monis got a gun.

The self-declared Muslim cleric was well known to ASIO, federal and NSW police for a string of alleged crimes and after he was convicted of sending of threats to the families of dead Australian soldiers. 

Thousands of people continue to flock to the area more than 24 hours later to pay tribute to the victims

As recently as Sunday he railed against Australian 'terrorism' on his website, vowing to fight the 'oppression and terrorism of USA and its allies including UK and Australia'.

'We want to know why he wasn't being monitored given his history of violence, his history of mental instability and his history of infatuation with extremism,' Mr Abbott said.

The prime minister's comments come as senior officials from the Australian Federal Police and ASIO appear before a national security committee in Canberra probing the government's proposed metadata retention laws.

People of all faiths have been leaving tributes, with many saying Tori and Katrina were 'brave Australians'

ASIO deputy director-general Kerri Hartland said terrorist attacks against Australia were 'not hypothetical'.

'Australia is a terrorist target and recent events have once again demonstrated that Australia is not immune from acts of terror,' she said.

Meanwhile, former prime minister John Howard and his wife Janette joined the stream of Sydneysiders continuing to pay their respects to the dead hostages at a makeshift floral shrine in Martin Place. 

A single bunch of white roses left resting on a pole when the siege ended at 2.15am on Tuesday has sparked the beginning of a makeshift shrine that has now grown to take over a large portion of Martin Place

The makeshift shrine at Martin Place started with just a few bunches of flowers before people from all over started flocking to the area

Tori Johnson and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson were both killed after being held hostage for more than 16 hours

As Australia mourned the dead, thousands of people gathered at Martin Place to lay flowers 

Hundreds of people were laying tributes on Wednesday in other areas of Martin Place

Workers laid flowers and notes early on Wednesday morning, more than 24 hours after the siege ended

Tony Abbott (pictured left with wife Margie Abbott) said it was tragic 'that people going about their everyday business should have been caught up in such a horrific incident'

Sydneysider Cat Delaney has been handing out tissues to mourners at the site for the past two days.

'When you get out into the middle and you're there amongst that emotion, it's overwhelming,' she said.

'When they get to me and I offer a tissue, it's permission to vent.'

Local florist George Lackerdas sold out his entire stock within an hour of opening on Wednesday.

'Two days worth of flowers I've sold in an hour. It's unbelievable,' he said.

'Yesterday I had queues of 30 people waiting non-stop until I sold out.'

Visibily distraught men and women have been laying tributes for the two innocent victims of the siege
