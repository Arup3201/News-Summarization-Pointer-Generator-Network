Andrea Downie says she slipped on a grape while shopping and can no longer work

A Queensland woman is suing Woolworths for $320,000, claiming she slipped on a grape and injured her back.

Andrea Downie, 39, from the Sunshine Coast, has filed a claim with the District Court in Brisbane, claiming she fell at the Tewantin Woolworths store in March or April last year.

Ms Downie claims the fall injured her back and caused an existing condition of post-traumatic stress disorder to flare up, meaning she could not return to work, reported the Courier Mail.

Ms Downie is suing Woolworths claiming that the supermarket failed to keeps its floors clean.

She also claims the grape was 'in clear view' of staff and that the supermarket chain failed to have an 'adequate system of inspecting floors'.

Ms Downie claimed Woolworths staff failed to be alert to hazards and spills, or warn her about loose grapes on the floor.

She also said Woolworths should place mats on the floor of the produce section to stop loose grapes from 'escaping' onto the floor.

Woolworths defended itself against the claims saying that Ms Downie did not complain to staff about the fall when it occurred and that it is 'uncertain' of the truth of her claim.

Ms Downie allegedly slipped wile shopping at the Tewantin story. The company says it is 'uncertain' if Ms Downie really did slip and fall, but if she did the damages she is claiming are 'excessive'

'If the fall occurred as alleged by [Ms Downie], it was not reported to anyone at Woolworths on the day,' the company states in its defence, reported the Courier Mail.

Woolworths stated that if the incident did occur, the damages claimed by Ms Downie were 'grossly excessive and unreasonable' and any loss of income results from her pre-existing physical and psychiatric conditions.

Woolworths offered to settle the case in April and the case will go to trial on November 17.

Woolworths declined to comment further on the matter.

Lawyer Sam Macedone told Today that the case was 'very interesting' because the incident was reported after the event.

He advised anyone involved in a slip-and-fall incident to report the accident to management immediately.

'If you fall over and you believe it’s their fault, you’ve slipped on something that’s on the floor, make a report of it straight away… Make sure it's on the record,' he said.
