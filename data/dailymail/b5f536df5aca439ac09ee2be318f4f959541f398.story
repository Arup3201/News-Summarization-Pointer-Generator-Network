While Louis van Gaal was being unveiled, Manchester United old boy Rio Ferdinand put thoughts of Old Trafford behind him.

The England defender, released by United at the end of the season, wrapped up his move to Queens Park Rangers, signing a 12 month contract.

Ferdinand was looking forward to resuming his Premier League career with Harry Redknapp’s side after putting pen to paper on a deal worth up to £70,000-per-week.

Redknapp said: 'He had other offers. He could've gone to
two top London clubs who wanted to speak to him, where he might have played and
not played, but he wanted to come here.

'I can't say who they were but that's
100 per cent fact.'

After 
completing a medical, Ferdinand arrived at Loftus Road 
to sign the contract and conduct in-house media duties.

Ferdinand, 35, arrived back in England earlier this week following his stint working for the BBC as a World Cup pundit.

The veteran defender has, however, been topping up his fitness over the summer in preparation for pre-season at QPR.

The move reunites Ferdinand with Redknapp, who gave the former England star his senior debut at West Ham in 1995.

Speaking exclusively to www.qpr.co.uk,
 Ferdinand said: 'I used to sit in the Loft – my Dad used bring me here 
as a young boy. QPR was the first professional club to ever sign me.

'There are great memories for me here – for my family.

'Anton
 had nothing but good things to say about QPR and I watched Les here as a
 boy, with the likes of Ray Wilkins, Clive Wilson, David Bardsley and 
Alan McDonald.'

Farewell: Ferdinand left Manchester United after 12 years of success at Old Trafford

Ferdinand,
 who has been involved in deals worth close to £50million, was one of 
Redknapp’s top targets as soon as promotion was assured via the 
play-offs in May.

And
 despite a reluctance from certain members of the Rangers hierarchy to 
rubber-stamp the deal given his age, Redknapp has got his man.

Ferdinand brings a wealth of top-level experience with him having spent 12 years at Old Trafford.

He helped United to 11 trophies, including six league titles, one Champions League, one FIFA World Club Cup and an FA Cup.

But his target next season will be much different as he looks to keep Rangers in the top-flight following their promotion.

Redknapp
 hopes Ferdinand’s capture will be the catalyst for several more 
purchases ahead of his side’s season-opener against Hull City on August 
16.

The
 Rangers boss is hoping to land Ajax striker Kolbeinn Sigthorsson after 
having a £4.8million offered accepted by the Dutch giants.

They are also interested in Cardiff central-defender Steven Caulker, who is also wanted by Crystal Palace and Southampton.
