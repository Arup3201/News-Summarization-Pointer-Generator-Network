Sara Agintas, 45, right, had a free gastric band operation and now she wants the NHS to send her daughter Hannah, 14, to £4,500 weight loss camp

A mother of six who dropped from 38 stone to 22 after having a free £14,000 gastric band says she now wants the taxpayer to send her overweight daughter to boot camp.

Sara Agintas, 45, from Milton Keynes, says that while she has managed to lose weight after having an operation to reduce her stomach capacity, she's concerned that her 14-year-old daughter, Hannah, who is 5ft 9in and weighs 17 stone, needs expensive intervention by the State. 

Mrs Agintas, who has shrunk from a size 38 to 22 since her operation in 2012, said: 'I can’t afford to pay for a weight loss camp, but I don’t see why the Government can’t step in and provide for her with a funded camp on the NHS.

'It would be an investment for her future - I have tried everything I can to help her at home, with no luck.'

Mrs Agintas had her gastric band operation done for nothing by a private surgeon after she appeared in the press two years ago calling to have the operation on the NHS.

At the time, she said: 'I can’t afford a personal trainer or weight-loss surgery – I need help from the taxpayer.' 

Now she believes the only way her daughter will lose weight is by attending a weight-loss camp for children - paid for by the State.

'I don't want Hannah to end up the way I was and if she doesn't stop, that's exactly what's going to happen,' she said.

'I just can't get through to her - she will eat anything she can get her hands on. 

'I make hearty home cooked meals at home from scratch, and I serve up smaller portions, but Hannah will always have seconds or finish up any leftovers - even though she doesn’t need it.' 

Mrs Agintas said: 'I would love her to go to a kids’ boot camp but it is just so expensive and way out of my price range. The camps I've looked at cost about £4,500 and that’s just not the kind of money I have.

'I think she would really benefit from going to a boot camp, so she can be out of the home environment and completely educated by health professionals.

'If she keeps on she will end up with no choice but to get a gastric band like me, and I don’t want that for her.'

The way she was: The mother of six went from size 38 and 38 stone to size 22 and 22 stone after her free op

Schoolgirl Hannah, whose BMI of 35 defines her as obese, said: 'I know I'm a bit overweight, but I don’t have as much to lose as my mum did.

'I think my mum has done really well and I’m proud of her.  I do want to lose some weight so she can be proud of me too, but I don’t find it easy.

'I wouldn't mind going to a boot camp.' 

In Britain, a five-week residential stay at a high-end fitness camp starts from £4,250.  Parents are told children can lose up to three stone, through a combination of diet, exercise and education about nutrition.

Mrs Agintas says she's sought medical advice about Hannah’s weight but has been offered no support.

'I've taken Hannah to the doctors about her weight but all I have been told is that she's fine and will grow out of it once her teenage years are over,' she said.

Since losing weight and keeping it off with healthy cooking and exercise, Mrs Agintas says she has improved the quality of her life, getting a job as a passenger escort for disabled children and becoming a parish councillor.

She said: 'The gastric operation really gave me the kick-start I needed to turn my life around. 

'Before, I was stuck to a sofa. I couldn't move or do anything, and the only time I went out was at night to do the weekly shop.

'It wasn't a life, and my doctor gave me just one year to live, but I couldn't leave my kids without a mum.'

Mrs Agintas lives at home with her three youngest children, Sam, 16, Hannah, and Zoe, 11.  Zoe is naturally slim, but both Sam and Hannah are overweight.

Mrs Agintas says her weight crept up after she suffered from cravings for junk food when she was pregnant

Time to work out: The family, who live in Milton Keynes, eat healthy, home-cooked food, but it isn't enough

Sam weighs 18 stone but is trying to lose weight by eating his mother’s healthy meals and joining a gym to lose weight.

Mrs Agintas said: 'The Government have billions of pounds, and I think they should spend some money helping parents who cannot afford to send their kids to a fat camp.

'More money needs to be spent on educating young people about food and exercise, it’s an investment for the future.

'I am worried about Hannah and her spiralling into what I was like. The situation is drastic and she needs to stop now before she gains any more weight. 

'Hannah only has about four stone to lose and I'm sure she can do it - but I have tried everything. You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink.' 

Gastric band surgery is available on the NHS, but not for everyone.  Guidelines say the patient must have a BMI of 40 or more, or a BMI between 35-40 and a serious health condition (such as high blood pressure) that could be improved if the patient loses weight. 

It also depends on where the patient lives - different clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in different areas may have varying criteria for eligibility.

Meanwhile, surgery for children is not recommended except for in exceptional circumstances where a child has a BMI of over 50 or is classed as morbidly obese.

GPs will offer advice on weight loss so a visit to the doctor will be the best place to start.

The NHS offers a free, downloadable 12-week weight loss plan, which advises on calorie intake and exercise.

Other services on offer include slimming clubs, meetings with dieticians, and exercise groups.
