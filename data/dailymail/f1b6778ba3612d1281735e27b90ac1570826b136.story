Germany and France have launched a dramatic euro power grab, demanding the right to dictate economic policy to other countries in the single currency.

France’s Nicolas Sarkozy announced – at a Paris summit with Germany’s Angela Merkel – that the two most powerful nations in the eurozone had agreed on a ‘true European economic government’ to deal with the debt crisis.

The 17 countries in the single currency will be ordered to balance their budgets by 2012 and will have their economic policies overseen by a new eurozone body.

EU president Herman Van Rompuy will lead the new body, which will meet twice a year to dictate tax and spending policies.

In what amounts to a major step toward a European superstate, France and Germany announced they will adopt a common corporate tax system by 2013, in an effort to signal they are ‘marching in step’ to protect the euro.

And they will draw up plans for a financial transaction tax, which will cost the City of London billions a year if it is extended to the UK.

The plans were a dramatic bid to reassure the markets that EU leaders are serious about saving the euro from collapse.

Chancellor George Osborne, who has been calling for bankrupt countries to cut spending, gave a cautious welcome.

Senior Treasury officials said they regarded further integration as ‘the only way to stop the euro from failing’.

They pledged to use the reorganisation as a chance to negotiate a better deal for Britain in Europe but vowed that the UK would refuse to join a system in which the EU dictated economic policy.

‘The general direction is what we’ve been suggesting,’ a source said. ‘This is the only way to stop the euro from collapsing. If that were to happen it would allow some people to say “We told you so” but the effect would be disastrous for us.’

Forty per cent of British trade is with the countries in the eurozone and UK banks have hundreds of billions of pounds of exposure to their French and German counterparts.

The source made clear that Britain would not let Brussels dictate tax or economic policy. ‘We won’t be joining any of this,’ the source added. ‘At every stage we will take the chance to advance British interests.’

Tough times: Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy discussed expanding the European Financial Stability Facility so it could help out Italy and Spain if necessary

Chancellor Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats suffered a setback when a regional leader was forced to resign over an affair with a 16-year-old girl.

Christian von Boetticher, 40, announced on Sunday he was stepping down as chairman of the CDU in Schleswig-Holstein state.

He had been the designated successor to CDU state premier Peter Harry Carstensen, 64, who is not running in an election in Germany's northern-most state in May 2012.

Boetticher's relationship with the teenager was not illegal, but has sparked complaints in the conservative party.

After a crisis meeting in the state capital Kiel, CDU officials said he would remain parliamentary floor leader in the state assembly.

Deputy CDU leader Angelika Volquartz said: 'Christian von Boetticher said that he had misjudged the moral component (of the relationship).'

In a poll published on Friday, Chancellor Merkel's centre-right coalition trailed behind a likely centre-left alliance of the Social Democrats and Greens.

If the plans eventually lead to a European treaty change, Britain would have to agree to the shake-up, allowing the UK to demand concessions.

David Cameron is likely to ask for guarantees that the EU budget will be restricted and may seek to opt out of some European workplace legislation blamed for harming business.

Despite the bold move by France and Germany, it is feared it will not be enough to halt fears over debt within the single currency.

President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel stopped short of backing so-called euro bonds, which would effectively mean Germany underwriting the debts of Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland.

And they failed to outline plans to expand the eurozone bailout fund, which is seen as vital to prevent defaults.

Mrs Merkel said euro bonds ‘won’t help us now’.

Mrs Merkel does not want Berlin to cover for the reckless spending of other countries – a view reinforced on Tuesday when figures showed that the German economy was barely growing.

The pair agreed they shared an ‘absolute determination’ to defend the euro by encouraging greater co-operation between its 17 members.

British officials said France and Germany have the clout to push through their plans.

But they will be fiercely resisted by Netherlands and Finland, whose voters will object to Paris and Berlin dictating their economic policy.

Mats Persson, of the Open Europe think-tank, said: ‘The proposals themselves will do little to solve the eurozone’s immediate crisis.

'They do reinforce the desire of Germany and France to seek more control over other countries’ economic affairs, in return for underwriting some of their debt.

‘Reining in public spending in countries such as Greece and Italy is absolutely necessary.’
