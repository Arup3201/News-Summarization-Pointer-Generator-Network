Every England player had a half-hour private meeting with team psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters before the Euro 2016 qualifying win in Switzerland.

Coach Gary Neville said the sessions were part of a plan to take away the fear of failing from Roy Hodgson’s team.

‘Over the years I have seen young players overwhelmed by fear of the consequences when things go wrong. It really bites you. The mental side of playing for England is different and we can no longer leave anything to chance,’ Neville said in his Daily Telegraph column.

Dr Steve Peters is the sports psychiatrist who began working with Liverpool  - and Luis Suarez - in November 2012.

Peters is the ‘mind mechanic’ credited with helping star cyclists Sir Chris Hoy, Sir Bradley Wiggins and Victoria Pendleton achieve their success.

The 59-year-old has also worked with striker Craig Bellamy, snooker’s Ronnie O’Sullivan and the England rugby union team which reached the 2007 World Cup final.

‘Last week Steve Peters, the team psychiatrist, had a 30-minute session with every single player. People wouldn’t know that. 

'I played for Manchester United for 17 years but there is nothing like England for scrutiny and brutality. It really bites you. So how do we nurture this generation so they actually enjoy it?'

England beat Switzerland 2-0 thanks to two goals from Arsenal's newest striker, Danny Welbeck. 

And Neville reckons England have been transformed by Hodgson as the Three Lions embark on their new killer strategy.

‘Roy has transitioned the side into a more adventurous outfit. It’s virtually a brand new team,' Neville continued. 'As we gathered to discuss the options for the Switzerland game he was categorical about using the diamond, which is one of the most complex formations to get right. He was adamant that he wanted Wilshere to play in that role. 

'He was enthusing about his talent and arguing that he wanted to see him pass creatively from a deep position. It might fail. We might be out on our ears in two years. But to claim there’s no progress is just plain wrong.'
