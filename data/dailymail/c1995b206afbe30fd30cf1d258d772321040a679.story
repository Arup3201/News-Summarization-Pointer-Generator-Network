Students at certain American colleges are facing the beginning of a school year without initiation ceremonies at fraternities and sororities as administrators hope to dramatically cut down the amount of hazing on campus.

Gone are the traditional fraternity open houses and introductory bashes at sorority houses as officials at New York's Binghamton University banned recruiting a new class of student pledges.

The strong decision for a ban comes after multiple reports surfaced last year of violent hazing on their campus, prompting fears that those stories of students being forced to hold hot coals and running over beds of rocks could turn fatal like some more extreme cases at other universities.

Quiet campus: New York's Binghamton University banned recruiting a new class of student pledges after a wake of complaints about hazing abuses

Hazing is not new among young college students but the well-publicized cases at Dartmouth University- where students were forced to eat vomit omelets - and Florida's A&M University - where a student on the drum band was beaten to death on a school bus - that left Binghamton administrators fearing the worst.

Though there were no confirmed deaths or hospitalizations due to the hazing on Binghamton's campus, students sent cries for help to the school's officials hinting that they weren't far off.

The New York Times reports that one anonymous email sent from a student to administrators told of the undisclosed lengths that his possible fraternity brothers would go to make sure he fit in.

'I was hosed, waterboarded, force-fed disgusting mixtures of food, went through physical exercises until I passed out, and crawled around outside in my boxers to the point where my stomach, elbows, thighs and knees are filled with cuts, scrapes and bruises,' the student wrote in the email.

A junior female student wrote about what two of her younger friends were being put through, telling of how sorority pledges had to stand in a freezing cold shower while reciting the Greek alphabet.

Others had to eat unidentified mixtures of food that were cooked up solely to make the diner throw up.

At the end of the email, she wrote a plea for top-down action: 'Save the innocent and naïve who can’t seem to save themselves'.

Binghamton, one of the state's best public schools located more than three-hour's drive from New York City, did just that.

The abuses: Though no students came forward publicly, several complained of being 'waterboarded, force-fed disgusting mixtures of food, and made to pass out from over-exercise'

According to the school's student newspaper Pipe Dreams, administrators cited an 'alarmingly high number of serious hazing complaints this spring' and 'the serious physical and psychological health risk to all involved.' as the reasons behind the decision.

That said, only three of the 53 sanctioned fraternities and sororities were temporarily banned from recruiting new pledges.

One of the biggest problems facing any institutional change is the fact that no students are willing to publicly come forward and complain about the happenings.

In the case of Dartmouth, a former fraternity brother named Andrew Lohse wrote an editorial describing in horrific detail the ways in which pledges were treated. As a result, 27 other fraternity brothers faced charges but were eventually cleared.

While the parents of children who lived through the extreme pledging process and the students themselves may be appreciative of the drastic action, it seems that others on campus feel the decision takes away one of the touchstones of 'traditional' college life.

At Binghamton, one of the biggest alleged offenders was Alpha Pi Epslion, an off-campus fraternity which is therefore only answerable to local police and not the university.

The Times tells the story of how police sergeant Michael Senio went to the house to respond to anonymous complaints about hazing abuses taking place but because there was no named victim, he had no legal authority to go inside.

'I can only speculate what was going on, but we could see the basement, which was like a disgusting-looking dark dungeon with hoses and standing water on the ground,' he said.
