She was today crowned as 2014’s most popular model by social media site Tumblr, but it seems that Kendall Jenner’s popularity did little to help her when it came to securing a spot in Balmain’s Spring 2015 campaign – despite the fact that she counts one of the brand’s top executives as a ‘close friend’.

Fans were stunned to see that 18-year-old Kendall, who was one of the stars of Balmain’s Spring/Summer show at Paris Fashion Week in September and is a firm friend of its creative director Olivier Rousteing, had failed to make the cut for the newly-launched ‘Army’ campaign, which features the likes of Adriana Lima, Joan Smalls and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. 

Speaking to Style.com about his casting decision, Mr Rousteing said: 'If I took Kendall, it would be in a different concept with different girls. And obviously, she’s my friend, but for this campaign I wanted to have Adriana with Rosie with Isabeli with Joan and Crista.'

Ouch: Despite Kendall's close friendship with its creative director Olivier Rousteing (pictured), the up-and-coming supermodel, 18, failed to make the cut

The energetic campaign - a tangle of lithe squabbling supermodels - sees Adriana, 33, Joan, 26, and Rosie, 27, positioned in a series of seductive poses alongside former Chanel model Isabeli Fontana, 31.

'You can really feel the army, you can feel the battle,' Mr Rousteing said. 'You can feel the power of the girls, and we usually don’t see that in a campaign.'

The shoot also stars lesser-known model Crista Cober, 26 - incidentally the only one from the 'sexy' Balmain line-up not to have walked in the esteemed Victoria's Fashion Secret Show - something Kendall would also know something about. 

The striking Kardashian-descendant was notably absent from this year's high-profile show, to the surprise of many.  

All-out war: 'You can really feel the army, you can feel the battle,' Mr Rousteing said of the photos (pictured). 'You can feel the power of the girls, and we usually don’t see that in a campaign'

Instead, Kendall sided with Karl Lagerfeld and, along with new best friend Cara Delevingne, took to the catwalk at Chanel's Métiers D'Arts Paris-Salzburg show in Austria on the same day.

Kendall, and indeed the rest of her famous family, are known to be good friends of Mr Rousteing.

Kim Karshadian is a particular fan of the French label, and matriarch Kris has been spotted on more than one occasion snuggling up to the fashion favorite at parties. 

Still - Kendall has made it very clear in the past that she is determined not to pull in any favors on her way up the career ladder.

Earlier this year, she said: 'I want to be high fashion. I want to be taken seriously. People think that this [success] just came to me. But it didn't. What I have has almost worked against me.'
