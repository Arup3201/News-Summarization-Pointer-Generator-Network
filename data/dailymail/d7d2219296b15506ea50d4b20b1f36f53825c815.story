West Ham are closing on a deal for Diego Poyet, son of Sunderland boss Gus.

The 19-year-old midfielder has attracted interest from Chelsea, Manchester City and Sunderland.

He is undergoing his medical ahead of completing his move to east London. He is a free agent and has agreed a four-year deal.

Property: Diego Poyet is closing in on a move to West Ham despite interest elsewhere

Predicament: Born in Spain to Uruguayan parents and raised in England, Poyet could play for all three nations

The youngster came through Charlton's academy and managed to make 23 appearances for the Addicks last season.

Born: April 8, 1995 (Age 19), Zaragoza, Spain

England youth capsU16: 7U17: 6

Debut: Charlton vs Oxford, January 21, 2014

Appearances: 23

Addicks' Player of the Year: 2013-14

He won the Charlton Player of the Year award. That came, incredibly, despite the youngster only breaking into the team in January.

Charlton had been in discussions with Poyet's representatives over an extension to his deal, which expired on July 1, but he made his feelings clear by telling the club he would not report to pre-season training.

Poyet, born in Spain to Uruguayan parents and raised in England, finds himself in a rare predicament.

He can play for all three, as he holds a passport for each, but has represented England at U16 and U17 levels.
