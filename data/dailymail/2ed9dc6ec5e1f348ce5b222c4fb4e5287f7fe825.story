Fraud conviction: Stacey Tipler, 32, plundered public funds earmarked for lifesaving drugs while working in the accounts department of the Royal Marsden Hospital Trust in London

An NHS accounts worker who stole £640,000 from a cancer hospital's drugs fund and blew the cash on her wedding was jailed for four years today.

Stacey Tipler, 32, of Carshalton, Surrey, plundered public funds earmarked for lifesaving drugs while working in the accounts department of the Royal Marsden Hospital Trust in central London.

She diverted the money which was meant for hospital suppliers into bank accounts controlled by a gang of her accomplices, who then passed most of it back to her and her window-fitter fiancé, Scott Chaplin, 33.

He was jailed for five and a half years.

Passing sentence at Southwark Crown Court today Judge Anthony Leonard QC said Chaplin was the 'main instigator' but Tipler was 'invaluable' to the scam, which he said could had been 'catastrophic' for the hospital’s patients.

He added: 'The skill which you showed in trying to ensure the fraud would go undiscovered was very great and very dishonest. It was a very clever but dishonest fraud.'

The money was funnelled to the group of associates and mostly withdrawn as cash as part of a money laundering operation before the lion’s share was passed back to Chaplin.

The couple maintained a 'cash reserve' to meet their bills and mortgage payments.

They are also understood to have spent several thousand pounds on a deposit for a venue in Surrey for their proposed wedding, although the nuptials did not took place because Tipler was arrested a year before the big day

The gang members spent their share of the proceeds on mortgage payments and shopping sprees at luxury designers Gucci and Louis Vuitton. One spent £200 at the London Parachute School.

At one point a drugs firm threatened to stop supplying the hospital with medication after failing to receive payment because of the scam, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Because of an oversight by Tipler, the details of two of their co-defendants stayed in place of suppliers when payments were transferred to a central NHS system in April 2012.

Judge Leonard said: 'The impact of the failure to reverse the scheme could have been catastrophic for the hospital patients because one of the drugs suppliers threatened to stop supplying vital medicines.'

Mother of two Tipler betrayed no emotion as she was sentenced for her role in the fraud, which was uncovered by NHS investigators in May 2012.

Money of varying amounts was passed to the accounts of Adrian Horan, 43, Clinton Woollery, 35, Thomas Quinlan, 26, Russell Baker, 32, and William Flynn, 37.

Horan, of Sutton, Surrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to money launder.

Woollery, of Sutton; Quinlan, of Banstead, Surrey; Baker, of Worcester Park, Surrey, and Flynn, of Wallington, Surrey, admitted conspiracy to money launder.

Another defendant, Roy Harriott, 31, of Sutton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to money launder after receiving a banker’s cheque worth £32,000.

Horan was jailed for 21 months, Flynn for a year, Woollery for 10 months and Quinlan for eight months.

Baker and Harriott were given suspended sentences of nine weeks and 12 weeks respectively.

Kelly Matthews, a lawyer with the CPS’ Specialist Fraud Division, said: 'This was a sophisticated, large-scale fraud orchestrated to divert vital public funds for essential equipment and medicines at the Royal Marsden.

'Tipler and Chaplin bear the brunt of responsibility but they didn’t act alone.

'It was only with the others agreeing for their bank accounts to be used to launder the money that they were all able to benefit from the fraud.

'This was a selfish and gross misuse of public funds and today those responsible have been brought to justice.'

Sue Frith, head of the National Investigation Service at NHS Protect, said: 'These custodial sentences reflect the seriousness of the offences and will act as a powerful deterrent to others.

'All suspicions of fraud reported to NHS Protect will be followed up and investigated wherever appropriate. We press for prosecution of offenders and seek the strongest possible sanctions.'

Outside court: William Flynn, 37, who helped siphon the stolen cash away, was today jailed for a year

Southwark Crown Court had heard how Tipler was arrested after suspicious staff at suppliers Alliance Healthcare notified the NHS that the company had received two remittance slips with no accompanying payment.

Tipler initially denied the scam but later admitted fiddling the accounts after claiming to have been threatened by two of her accomplices.

She also said one of them had attacked Chaplin to put pressure on her.

But Tipler's claims were rejected by the jury and she was convicted alongside Chaplin of masterminding the scam after a two-week trial.

Prosecutor Anthony Hucklesby said: '[The hospital's] patients tend to have more complex types of cancer and this fraud targeted the supplies of essential cancer drugs to the hospital.'

'There was one stage that one of the main pharmaceutical suppliers threatened to stop supplying drugs to the hospital as a result of non-payment, which would have meant that patient treatment could not continue.'

Leon 
Kazakos, defending said: ‘She worked at the hospital for ten years in 
roles where she was entrusted to perform functions in respect of money 
and not once in those ten years was there any episode of dishonesty.’

He added that Tipler regretted carrying out the scams and would be parted from her two young children when in jail.

Peter
 Gray, defending Chaplin, admitted he was a ‘central figure’ in the 
plot. 'There are those two young children, aged four years and nine 
months,' he continued.

'He
 has made his farewells to them and to say it has been a traumatic 
matter for all concerned would probably be under expressing their 
sentiments.'

Investigators
 have only been able to claw back around half of the stolen cash and the
 Trust, one of the country’s leading cancer research centres, is still 
around £310,000 out of pocket.

The money was diverted from Alliance Pharmaceuticals, Hospira Aseptic Services, Baxter Healthcare Ltd, Alliance Healthcare and AAH Pharmaceutical Ltd between December 2011 and May 2012.
