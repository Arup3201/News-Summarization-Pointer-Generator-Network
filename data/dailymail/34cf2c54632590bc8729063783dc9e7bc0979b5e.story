A 72-year-old amateur gardener has spent three years and £20,000 building Britain's biggest water-powered cuckoo clock - which is the size of a house.

Richard Pim designed and built the 25ft tall clock, complete with a 3ft wooden cuckoo which pops out every hour and chimes with a huge pipe organ.

It is powered by a complex system of cantilevers, counterweights and pulleys which convert energy from a passing stream.

Mr Pim, who is a retired hydrogeologist used his experience to design and 
build the wooden structure at his water gardens in Herefordshire.

Giant achievement: It took a total of three years and about £20,000 to complete the unique clock

Proud owner: 72-year-old Richard Pim masterminded the project, and built most of the 25-ft tall clock by himself

Wake-up call: This 3ft painted cuckoo is a scaled-up version of the birds that were designed for the original cuckoo clocks made in Germany's Black Forest

He said: 'I think it's quite fun and rather beautiful. I wanted to make something that made people laugh.

'It took a while to build, but I did almost all the work myself.

'I had a local carpenter and local machinists help me with some of the frame and the metalworking though."

Mr Pim's knowledge of complex water-powered structures comes from a long career spent bringing water to arid farmlands in Saudi Arabia and Nepal.

He drafted in an organ-maker to help build the complicated mechanism that makes the bird cuckoo.

The house uses pipes and bellows to create compressed air to pump through a music box, tuned to mimic the call of the bird.

He said: 'It's gaining a few minutes every day at the moment.

'The warmer weather causes the wood to warp slightly and makes the water flow differently through the system of pipes and tanks.

Picturesque: At almost 7m tall the cuckoo clock should be an eyesore. But the structure's quaint design and floral surroundings look like a fairytale scene

No need for a watch: Richard Pim and his wife Sally will only have to glance out of the window to see the time in their back garden

Sweet sounds: The organ pipes and music box used to generate the distinctive cuckoo call every hour. Mr Pim had help from a specialist organ-maker to build the clock's mechanism

'But no-one's setting their watches by it.'

The
 clock is one of the attractions at 
Westonbury Mill Water Gardens, a three-and-a-half acre visitor garden.

Mr Pim owns a granite tower with gargoyles modelled after his own head, and an igloo built out of glass bottles.

His wife Sally said: 'Three years to build the clock is 
astonishing. I think it's amazing what Richard does, astonishing.'

Mr Pim
 said: 'I'm going to keep on making them until I can't any more, I 
think. It's something I enjoy very much and it keeps me very busy, and 
happy.

'A garden needs some action. It's a great thing for kids to come and see the mechanism - to see how engineering really works.'

Hard graft: Mr Pim had some help from local carpenters to complete his mammoth project, but did most of the work himself

In the running?: The largest cuckoo clock in the world is said to be in Ohio. The world's biggest free-hanging cuckoo clock is in Germany
