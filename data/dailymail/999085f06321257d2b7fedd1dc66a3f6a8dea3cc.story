A woman tried to kill her mother by poisoning her Diet Coke in a plot inspired by Breaking Bad, a court heard.

Kuntal Patel, 37, allegedly bought a Ricin-style poison online to murder her ‘violent’ mother, who would not allow her to marry her boyfriend.

But 60-year-old Meena Patel, a magistrate, survived.

Patel, a graphic designer, was arrested in January after the FBI traced the shipment to the family’s home in Plaistow, East London. She admitted buying Abrin, which has no antidote, from the illicit ‘dark web’.

Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay told Southwark Crown Court that ‘the Patels must have seemed a highly respectable and happy family’.

But Meena really controlled ‘every aspect’ of her daughters’ lives. When Kuntal met Niraj Kakad on Shaadi.com, a dating service for the Asian community, she was furious.

Mr Polnay said: ‘When Meena forbade Kuntal from marrying Niraj . . . Kuntal set out in a  calculated and premeditated fashion to murder her own mother. Inspired, in part, by US television series Breaking Bad, she acquired a deadly toxin called Abrin, a close  relation to Ricin. She acquired it over the “dark web”.

‘[It] arrived from the United States concealed in a wax  candle. Kuntal secretly poured the Abrin into her mother’s Diet Coke and watched her drink it – expecting her to die. But nothing happened.’

The poison is 1,000 times less toxic if swallowed, not inhaled or injected. Undeterred, Patel allegedly set about getting hold of a stronger sample.

The court heard Meena Patel locked Kuntal up and beat her. In messages, she called her a ‘witch’ and ‘f*****-up brain girl who cannot be my blood’ for loving Mr Kakad, who lived in America and proposed to Kuntal in November 2012. In an email, Kuntal branded Meena ‘evil’, adding: ‘I told her how much I liked him and she started slapping me.’

Meena allegedly called Mr Kakad a ‘black ugly b******’.

Kuntal wrote: ‘I’ll never  forgive her . . . I would prefer to be dead. I’m stuck with that miserable f***** until she dies.’ Meena hacked her daughter’s phone and seized her credit cards, Mr Polnay said. He added: ‘Meena’s attitude was “over my dead body”.

‘It was at this time, we say, that Kuntal Patel made the decision that the best way to ensure that she got what she wanted – happiness for herself – was by killing her mother.’ He told jurors: ‘In private, Meena Patel – the magistrate who worked in domestic  violence and race relations – was not a nice woman at all.’

She used ‘highly racist’ terms and could be violent, he said, adding: ‘Meena Patel was all of those things – manipulative, controlling and selfish. But she did not deserve to die.’

After she was charged, Kuntal allegedly confessed to Meena  in a phone call from prison, saying: ‘I was going to kill  you and Amba Ma [a Hindu Goddess] saw it, that’s why she has punished me . . . I did put that in your Coke.’

US series Breaking Bad stars Bryan Cranston as chemistry teacher Walter White, who cooks crystal meth to fund his cancer treatment. He kills a character using Ricin. Patel called the man who sold her the poison ‘Heisenberg’ – White’s alias.

Patel denies attempted murder and acquiring a biological agent or toxin. She admits two counts of attempting to acquire a biological agent or toxin.
