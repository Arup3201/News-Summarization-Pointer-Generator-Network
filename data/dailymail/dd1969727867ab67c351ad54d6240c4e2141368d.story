Dutch scientists have found that psychopathic criminals do not entirely lack empathy but fail to use it automatically.

Psychologists at the Social Brain Lab in Amsterdam have discovered criminal psychopaths can switch on the ability to empathise with another person at will, which could explain why they can be simultaneously callous but socially devious.

The researchers studied convicted criminals with a diagnosis of psychopathy watching film clips of people interacting to conclude that while psychopaths are capable of empathy, they might hurt others more easily than we do, because they do not automatically feel pain when they see the pain of their victims.

Offenders diagnosed with psychopathy pose a significant threat to society, because they are more likely to harm other people and to do so again after being released.

A new brain imaging study shows psychopaths have reduced empathy while witnessing the pains of others but when asked to recognise other peoples' emotions they can activate their empathy.

Researchers say this could explain why psychopaths can be callous and socially cunning at the same time.

Psychopaths characteristically demonstrate reduced empathy with the feelings of others, which may explain why it is easier for them to hurt other people.Â 

However, what causes this lack of empathy is poorly understood. Scientific studies on psychopathic subjects are notoriously hard to conduct.

Professor Christian Keysers, head of the Social Brain Lab in Amsterdam and lead author of the study, said: 'Convicted criminals with a diagnosis of psychopathy are confined to high-security forensic institutions in which state-of-the-art technology to study their brain, like magnetic resonance imaging, is usually unavailable.

'Bringing them to scientific research 
centres, on the other hand, requires the kind of high-security 
transportation that most judicial systems are unwilling to finance.'

The
Dutch judicial system, however, seems to be an exception. They joined 
forces with academia to promote a better understanding of psychopathy.

As
a result, criminals with psychopathy were transported to the Social 
Brain Lab of the University Medical Centre in Groningen where the team 
could use high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging to get a 
glimpse of the brain of criminals with psychopathy while they viewed the
emotions of others.

Psychologists at the Social Brain Lab in Amsterdam have discovered criminal psychopaths (such as Dr Hannibal Lecter played by Sir Anthony Hopkins in the film Red Dragon) can switch on the ability to empathise with another person at will, which could explain why they can be simultaneously callous but socially devious

The study, published in the journal Brain, involved 18 individuals with psychopathy and a control group.

Dr Harma Meffert, who was involved in the study, said all participants first watched short film clips of two people interacting with each other, zoomed in on their hands.

The movie clips showed one hand touching the other in a loving, a painful, a socially rejecting or a neutral way.

The criminals were asked them to look at these movies just as they would watch one of their favourite films.

Then they watched the same clips again. However, this time the researchers prompted them explicitly to empathise with one of the actors in the movie and asked them to really try to feel what the actors in the film clip were feeling.

Dr Meffert said: 'In the third and final part, we performed similar hand interactions with the participants themselves, while they were lying in the scanner, having their brain activity measured.

'We wanted to know to what extent they would activate the same brain regions while they were watching the hand interactions in the movies, as they would when they were experiencing these same hand interactions themselves.'

She said the human brain is equipped with what scientists call a 'mirror system'.

For example, the motor cortex of the brain normally allows you to move your own body. Your so called somatosensory cortex, when activated, makes you to feel touch on your skin. Your insula, finally, when activated makes you feel emotions like pain or disgust.

Brain scientists have discovered that when people watch other people move their body, or see those people being touched, or have emotions, these same brain regions are activated. In other words, the actions, touch or emotions of others become your own.

It has been suggested that people with psychopathy might somehow suffer from a broken mirror system, resulting in a diminished ability to empathize with their victims.

However when asked to just watch the film clips, the psychopaths did activate their mirror system, but less so than people without psychopathy.

Professor Keysers said: 'Regions involved in their own actions, emotions and sensations were less active than that of controls while they saw what happens in others.

'At first, this seems to suggest that psychopathic criminals might hurt others more easily than we do, because they do not feel pain, when they see the pain of their victims.'
