It's the sort of far-fetched accident you would expect to see in a Tom and Jerry sketch - but what happened to Quasimodo the cat is no laughing matter.

After being hit by a car at 70mph, the poor moggy became wedged head first in the front of the vehicle as it drove a further ten miles down the motorway.

With his top half buried in the car's grill and pressed against the hot running engine, the tips of his ears were agonisingly burnt off - leaving him as deformed as his namesake.

No laughing matter: Quasimodo is half concealed with his head wedged in the car's grill

The collision happened shortly before midnight when Stephanie Huber was driving her Peugeot at full speed on the A14 past the Gisikon exit heading towards Lucerne, Switzerland.

The young woman told police she had not seen anything, but had heard a muffled thud and carried on without thinking much of it.

But when she parked in Lucerne she realised that the grill on the front bumper had a cat's body sticking out of it, with the head wedged inside. 

When she saw the animal was alive, she quickly called the police. 

Swiss police spokesman Urs Wigger said: 'After hearing that a motorist had struck an animal at 120 kilometres-an-hour we were positive it wouldn't be alive, especially after then being carried along by the car for another 12 kilometres. 

'When we found out that it had indeed survived, it was a real surprise.

Sticky situation:  The poor cat was left completely helpless after being hit by the car at 70mph and dragged for another ten miles down the motorway 

'The officers were unable to free the cat and so a vet was called to carry out the complicated procedure.'

The vet, Nico Kipfer, 38,  then tranquillised Quasimodo so that it could be removed without causing further injury.

The stricken animal was taken to the veterinary surgery in Lucerne where it needed to be operated on several times to treat head injuries. 

Mr Kipfer added: 'We had to operate on him three or four times but he is now out of danger for sure.'

Road to recovery: Despite having most of his ears burnt off, Quasimodo is now on the mend

Animal clinic boss Martin Keiser, 46, said that Quasimodo had head injuries but that the real damage had been caused by the hot motor. 

He added: 'I don't think in all my years as a person in charge of an animal clinic that I have ever such a remarkable survival story.'

When the owner was not found, the vet nicknamed the cat Quasimodo to match his new unfortunate appearance. 

He has now been adopted by staff at the clinic, who say they want to keep him after all they have been through together.
