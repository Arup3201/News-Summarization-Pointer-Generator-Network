Benefits will be docked from feckless parents who refuse to take classes on how to improve their children’s discipline, diet and exercise under plans being discussed by senior Tories.

A secret party document photographed in Downing Street reveals MPs preparing the Conservative election manifesto are considering attaching new conditions to welfare.

Carried by MP Margot James, who sits on a policy advisory board which is drawing up proposals for Prime Minister David Cameron, it reads: ‘Apply conditions for parents on benefits (training or parenting classes)’.

Conservative MP Margot James, pictured has worked on proposals to restrict benefits payments to parents who refuse to participate in training to prepare themselves for the workplace

The Government carried out a trial of a voluntary voucher scheme for parenting classes in the wake of the 2011 riots to counter a breakdown of family discipline. But fewer than four per cent of eligible parents in three underprivileged areas took up the £100 vouchers.

The CANParent scheme offered mothers and fathers in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, Camden in London, and High Peak in Derbyshire vouchers to spend on classes covering discipline, diet and exercise, bullying and preparing children for school.

Miss James’s document suggests the Tories now want to go far further to make parents sign up, by making receipt of benefits conditional on co-operation with training by charities and experts.

‘The notes I was carrying were just my thoughts, and not yet policy, but conditionality is something I think we need to consider seriously,’ she told the Daily Mail.

Senior Conservatives are known to favour linking receipt of benefits to parenting in a further wave of welfare reform.

Education Secretary Michael Gove wants to dock child benefit from almost 20,000 parents a year whose children play truant from school.

He believes £120 penalties issued by schools to families whose children are persistently absent should be clawed back via the welfare system. Parents have a legal responsibility to ensure their children attend school from five to 16.

The plan is expected to be included in the Conservatives’ election manifesto next year, having been blocked in coalition by the Liberal Democrats.

There were 41,224 penalty notices for non-attendance at school issued in 2011/12 – the latest figures available – of which only 22,043 were paid within the time limit of 28 days.

Under the proposal being backed by Mr Gove, the remaining 19,181 families would have the penalty doubled to £120 and seen it automatically docked from their child benefit.

Ministers argue there is a problem with the enforcement of the current rules. Currently, £1.3million a year is raised from truancy fines. But almost half the total issued since 2004 went unpaid.

Between 2004/05 and 2011/12, there were 168,958 fines, yet only 86,787 were paid before the penalty notice lapsed. If fines are not paid within 42 days, the fine lapses and the only recourse for local authorities is to pursue prosecution. However, 60 per cent of those who do not pay their fines are never taken to court.

The document Miss James was carrying into Number Ten also set out the Government’s commitment to offer ‘tax free childcare’, with a subsidy of up to £2,000 a year per child for working parents.

It also appears to confirm the Tories will encourage schools to operate ten-hour days to boost standards by allowing time for structured homework, as well as fitting in with the working patterns of dual-earner couples.
