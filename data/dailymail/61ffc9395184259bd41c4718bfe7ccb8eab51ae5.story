A multi-millionaire stakeholder in Laura Ashley has been accused of 'playing games' with the High Court after he failed to turn up to his own £440million divorce hearing. 

Mr Justice Holman said it was the second 
time that Khoo Kay Peng, 74, 'just has not turned up' to a preliminary 
hearing of the dispute in the London court's Family Division.

The judge said Dr Khoo had breached a 
High Court rule by not appearing to for the hearing over his prospective divorce from his estranged wife Pauline Chai, 66, who is a former 'Miss Malaysia' model.

Lawyers for Dr Khoo said the businessman was on a flight from Paris to the Far East and could not be contacted.

'He should not be on a plane. He is playing games... For the second time, he just has not turned up,' said Mr Justice Holman.

'It is treating this court with contempt. That's the position,' he added.

The judge said 'this man owns a chunk of Laura Ashley' and added: 'It is very serious. It is very serious... I don't feel he is showing the respect he should be showing.'

A lawyer for Mrs Chai - who has previously said she has 'nothing' financially and wants 'many millions' from Dr Khoo - told the court: 'It is no surprise to us.'

Mr Justice Holman has heard the couple's marriage broke down after 43 years together.

The couple also disagree over where their divorce battle should be staged.

Dr Khoo, who is based in Malaysia, says litigation should take place there. Mrs Chai, who lives in Britain, says it should take place here.

The judge has heard that Dr Khoo has run up legal bills of nearly £750,000, and Mrs Chai more than £1 million.

He says the litigation seems 'out of control' and has urged the couple to 'sit down together and negotiate'.

'These parties are engaged in these phenomenally expensive jurisdictional skirmishes here and in Malaysia and what they should be doing is talking,' said Mr Justice Holman.

'This rule [is] about getting people in front of the court so they can be faced up to the realities.'

Tim Bishop QC, for Dr Khoo, said his client feared that appearing in an English court hearing might 'prejudice Malaysian legal proceedings.

'How can it make a difference?' said Mr Justice Holman. 'It's rubbish. It's rubbish. It's ridiculous.'

Richard Todd, QC for Mrs Chai, said his client thought that Dr Khoo had a wealth of £440 million.

'We hear nothing from Dr Khoo about valuation, about what he is worth. We have to try and work it out," he said.

'Mrs Chai has nothing at all,' he added.
