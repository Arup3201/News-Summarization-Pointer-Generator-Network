The richest MP in Parliament has spoken of a £1million wrecking spree which saw a Jeep smash into three aircraft and demolish buildings on his country estate – just hours after he was sacked as a minister.

Two planes were destroyed and a third was rammed into buildings at the airstrip, causing horses to bolt from their paddock and charge along a busy road.

Richard Benyon, 53, said: ‘The horses were running up and down the A4 – the vehicle had smashed into the aircraft, pushing one into the buildings, and it then crashed through gates and across fields.’

Mr Benyon, the Conservative MP for West Berkshire who is worth £200million, said his vast Englefield estate between Newbury and Reading had been ‘plagued for years’ by gangs staging illegal hare coursing events.

There had also been numerous thefts and vandalism of crops, but nothing on the scale of Monday night’s damage.

Thames Valley Police, who are questioning a 29-year-old man from Slough, Berkshire, say a Jeep was deliberately driven into the planes on the 20,000-acre estate.

The man has been bailed until November 18.

Peter Ford, 70, of Upper Basildon, near Reading, who owns one of the planes, said: ‘I was gobsmacked, stunned, at the damage.

‘They left bits of the car embedded in the planes. They were completely trashed with the wings almost detached.

‘Our plane is like a vintage car – we spent a lot of time, love and money to keep it going and there’s only half a dozen in the UK.

‘They’re no longer in production.’

Police estimated the damage to the planes at £750,000.

Mr Benyon lives at Englefield House in the heart of the estate with his second wife Zoe, 42, and son Louis.

Michael and Carole Middleton, parents of the Duchess of Cambridge, live in a £7million country mansion four miles from Englefield.

On Monday, Mr Benyon was fired as an environment minister and will return to the back benches in a government shake-up by David Cameron, who was raised in the village of Peasemore, a few miles from Englefield.

Wrecked: One of the Cessna airplanes damaged on Mr Benyon's estate

One of the planes was a classic 1950s vintage Cessna G-AXZO. The others are also thought to be Cessnas.

A Jeep Grand Cherokee was discovered on fire on the nearby A4 at Theale.

Mr Benyon is regarded as the wealthiest MP in Parliament. The great-great-grandson of three-times Tory Prime Minister Lord Salisbury.

He can trace his ancestry back to William Cecil, the chief political adviser to Elizabeth I.

He was appointed a minister at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in 2010.

He is a former officer with the Royal Green Jackets and is the son of Sir William Benyon, himself a former Tory MP.

Englefield House is in a  private walled estate that includes farmland, woodland and a model village.

It was built during the reign of Elizabeth I, who granted the manor of Englefield to her ‘spymaster’, Sir Francis Walsingham.

The house came into the Benyon family’s possession in the early 19th century. The gardens are open all year but the house is open only to pre-booked group tours.

The Benyons also have land and property interests in London and Scotland. Mr Benyon, MP for Newbury since 2005, also owns a £1.5million house near Westminster.

Englefield House is often used as a location for TV series and films such as X-Men: First Class, The King’s Speech and Great Expectations.

Last night a police spokesman said they were still hunting another person in connection with the attack.
