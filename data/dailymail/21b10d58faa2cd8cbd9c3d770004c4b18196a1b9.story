It's a common practice for people to leave honest appraisals of a hotel after their stay, and they are often scathing and highly critical.

However, after one too many rude guests, a hotel group has decided to start reviewing their guests and publishing their scorecard online.

Art Series Hotel Group will trial a new program, 'Reverse Review' at their six hotels in Victoria and South Australia.

It gives the hotel staff the opportunity to rate guests' behaviour and post their scorecard online.

The six hotels that are part of the Art Series Hotel Group will trial a 'Reverse Review' system to rate the behaviour of their guests - including cleanliness and manners

The Art Series Hotel's hotels (pictured) intend the program as a fun activity for guests with a chance to reward their best guests with free accommodation 

'Think you're the perfect hotel guest?' the ad asks.

'Stay and request to be reviewed at any of our hotels from April 17 until May 31.

'Get four or five stars and get a free night to stay again. But be warned, if you misbehave, everyone will know!'

Art Series Hotel Group Marketing Director Ryan Tuckerman said the program has been inspired by online review website 'TripAdvisor' and is intended as a fun activity for guests and staff alike.

'Reverse Reviews flips the process on its head and provides a way for us to recognise and reward good behaviour in a fun and light-hearted way.'  

'These days everyone's a critic. The internet has enabled people to rate every film, restaurant or latte they experience, good or bad,' the hotels' website explains.

'So what would happen if we made it a two way street?

'We have many guests who fail to meet our standards but we didn't have a forum of our own - until now.'

The Hotel Group are curious to see if the fear of dirty laundry being aired in public affects their guests' behaviour.

It comes after a study by Galaxy Research unveiled the truth about awful behaviour in Australian hotels and the filthy acts that go on behind closed doors.

The number of people game enough to admit that they are guilty of trashing rooms, parading naked in front of windows and stealing proves that even grown adults run amuck when they're away from home.

One in ten people steal items like bedding, irons and light globes from hotels.

'We even have guests who pilfer the batteries from our television remotes, bless them,' added Tuckerman.

400,000 people confess that they have trashed a hotel room, with the hotel remarking: 'I'm sure not all of them are rock stars'.

20 per cent of people confessed that they'd walked in front of windows naked.

Also, the study found that wealthier people are more likely to misbehave and 'the poorer you are the less likely you are to take an item without paying'.

According to the study, the ideal hotel guest is a woman from regional Victoria or Tasmania aged 50-plus, married with no blue-collar jobs with an income of $40 thousand or less a year.

A person fitting this description has been found to be less likely of committing an anti-social act.

'We do have special guests; one who always greet us with a smile and make us want to come to work.

'We want to bring them back for an extra night, because these are the kind of guests we want at Art Series Hotel.'

The hotel divulges that 60 per cent of people staying in their penthouse have been awarded an upgrades, specifically rewarded to people who have been pleasant, clean and walked around with a smile on their face.

So, what does one need to do to score a five star rating?

'There are some insider tips and tricks that are simple and really make the day of the hotel team,' Tuckerman explains.

'These include exchanging day to day pleasantries, putting the sign out on the door as soon as your room is ready to be made up, opting to have your linen changed less frequently and keeping dirty towels in a pile.'

Resisting the urge to steal the amenities is also looked upon fondly.
