Liverpool middleweight Antony Fowler is relishing his role as public enemy number one after ending the hopes of home favourite Kieran Smith at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

The former world bronze medallist, who is the cousin of Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler, proved too strong for the game Smith, ramming home thumping hooks throughout the three-round contest which he won clearly on points.

Fowler made the most of the hostile atmosphere, raising his arms to salute the predominantly Scottish crowd at the start, and ending the contest with an in-ring Ali Shuffle.

Fowler said: 'That is one of my best nights in my life so far and hopefully the gold medal, then I’ll be the happiest man in here.

'I was up against it with the crowd and obviously the judges can be swayed but I had to make it clear and I was making it clear because I was landing big, heavy shots.

'It was a great fight. I was expecting to be chasing him around the ring but he came to me – I was shocked.

'I was just boxing clever.'
