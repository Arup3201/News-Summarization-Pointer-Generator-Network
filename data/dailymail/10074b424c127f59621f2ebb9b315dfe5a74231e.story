It is believed they were outside for most of the night during an Arctic blast that swept Virginia with sub-freezing temperatures and gusting winds. 

Captain Jeff Pearce of the Spotsylvania County Sheriff's Office said their bodies have been sent to the medical examiner. 

An autopsy will reveal if the weather played a role in their deaths.
