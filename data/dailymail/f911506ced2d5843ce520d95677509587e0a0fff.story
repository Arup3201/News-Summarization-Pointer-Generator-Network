Barack Obama today took a chance to boast about healthcare reform to a group of six-year-old girls - though admitted that Obamacare is not as impressive as a device for turning the pages of a book.

The president, put on the spot by a crowd of Oklahoma Girl Scouts to name something he'd come up with to match their device, plumped for his much-touted healthcare reforms.

Obama, who was touring exhibits at the annual White House Science Fair, made the jokey exchange before pledging $240million in federal dollars to boost the study of science and technology.

'What have I done?': President Barack Obama said that he came up with healthcare reform in a brain-storming session when asked to name an achievement by six-year-old Girl Scouts

'Heard of healthcare.gov?': Obama admitted his five-year-old shakeup of the healthcare industry was 'not as good' as a device the girls had made to help arthritic people read books more easily

He seized on the Lego page-turning device, which was being exhibited by Emily Bergenroth, Alicia Cutter, Karissa Cheng, Addy Oneal, and Emery Dodson.

The girls, all aged six, are members of a Girl Scout troop in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and developed their contraption to help those who are paralyzed or arthritic read more easily.

When the Commander-in-Chief asked how they had come up with the device, one answered that 'a brain-storming session' was the answer, then asked whether he had any to his name.

Obama conceded: 'I have had a couple of brain-storming sessions, but I didn't come up with anything this good.'

Announcement: Obama also used the annual fair, held at the White House, to announce $240million of funding for science, technology engineering and math

'See, you guys are already better brain-stormers than I am.'

The persistent Girl Scout followed up her question, asking: 'What did you come up with?'

He replied: 'I mean, I came up with things like, you know, health care.

'It turned out OK, but it started off with some prototypes.' His flagship health legislation is five years old today.

The girls were among 35 young science fair winners who came to the White House to show off their inventions, which ranged from spinal implants to computer password technology.

Favorites: Obama lingered at the display by the so-called 'supergirl' team, who had made their invention partly out of Lego

He later announced the hefty new government investment into so-called STEM subjects, an acronym for science, technology, engineering and math.

The pledges the president announced include a $150million philanthropic effort to encourage promising early-career scientists to stay on track and a $90million campaign to expand STEM opportunities to underrepresented youth, such as minorities and girls.

Altogether, the new STEM commitments have brought total financial and material support for these programs to $1billion.

'It's not enough for our country just to be proud of you. We've got to support you,' Obama said later, addressing students and scientists in the White House East Room.

Talking it up: The president said that his Educate to Innovate strategy is a way to 'support' science rather than just be 'proud' of it

More than 100 colleges and universities have committed to training 20,000 engineers, and a coalition of CEOs has promised to expand high-quality STEM education programs to an additional 1.5million students this year.

Obama launched 'Educate to Innovate', his effort to encourage the study of science, technology, engineering and math, in 2009.

Obama said the fair is one of the most fun events held annually at the White House. He said: 'Every year I walk out smarter than when I walked in'.

Obama's science adviser, John Holdren, joined the president during the tour of the displays, introducing himself to the young inventors and researches.

He said: 'Amazing - these kids are so much more advanced than when I was in school.'

At each of the 12 display stations, Obama quizzed the participants about their projects.

At one, Anvita Gupta, a 17-year-old from Scottsdale, Arizona, described the special algorithm she had devised to identify other medical applications for existing drugs.

Obama turned to the group of reporters and photographers trailing him.

'Just saying, I don't know what you all have been doing - This is what she's been doing.'
