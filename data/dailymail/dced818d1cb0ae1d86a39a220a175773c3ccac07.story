He was a contentious euthanasia activist who claimed to have assisted in the suicides of more than 130 patients, spending eight years in prison on murder charges as a result of one case.Now the secret artworks of the late Dr. Jack Kevorkian - a Michigan-based physician who bore the notorious nickname 'Dr. Death' - have gone on display at a Los Angeles gallery and are available for purchase, with some costing up to $45,000 each.It was little-known that the pathologist was an amateur painter, with his career solely focused on inflaming a nationwide debate in the 1990's about a terminally ill person's right to die.Among the 11 unsettling pieces that make up the exhibition at the Gallerie Sparta in West Hollywood is one depicting an elderly patient slowly being pulled into the mouth of a desk mask, which has been painted to resemble a CAT scan machine.

Euthanasia advocate Dr. Jack Kevorkian -- who died in 2011 -- was also an avid painter. Eleven of his works, as well as his 'Thanatron' suicide machine, are on display and for sale this month at Gallerie Sparta in Hollywood, California. This piece is called 'Coma'

Kevorkian served eight years in prison for second-degree murder after administering a lethal injection rather than helping the patient do it himself

'Fever' is meant to depict 'the great discomfort of intense bodily heat,' Kevorkian said. 'The inferno is internal, and in some tragic cases even the will to live is charred.'

The work of Jack Kevorkian signified much of what he thought was wrong with modern medicine

His artwork represents his fascination with the intersection between physical and spiritual suffering, like this piece titled 'Paralysis'

The painting is called 'Coma', according to CNN.The exhibition also includes the assisted suicide machine that Kevorkian designed and built, the 'Thanatron.'.The contraption helped inject a series of drugs into terminal and incapacitated patients who wished to end their lives.It too is for sale to the highest bidder, at a starting price of $25,000.

This 1999 painting called 'Chromatic Fantasy' is displayed with the Bach portrait and 'Fugue', which displays a bass clef

'Fugue' is part of the trio of 1999 paintings displayed with the Bach portrait and 'Chromatic Fantasy'

Kevorkian created this portrait of Johann Sebastian Bach as an expression of his love for the German composer's music

Kevorkian's medical career ended in 1999 when he was convicted on charges of second degree murder for administering a lethal injection to a patient who was suffering Lou Gehrig's disease, or ALS, which attacks the nerve cells in the brain and spinal chord.He spent eight years in prison.In 2011, he died peacefully and pain-free from ongoing kidney disease.He was 83.Efforts to sell the paintings following Kevorkian's death were hampered by a legal dispute over their ownership. For many years, they were housed in the Armenian Library and Museum of America in Watertown, Massachusetts, near Boston.

Eleven of artworks from Dr. Jack Kevrokian as well as his 'Thanatron' suicide machine, are on display and for sale this month at Gallerie Sparta in Hollywood, California

After his death, the Kevorkian estate claimed the art work was only on loan to the museum.The dispute was resolved with the museum retaining four of his works. Kevorkian's niece is now offering the paintings in her possession for sale at Gallerie SpProceeds go to the estate and the gallery, and the paintings that don't sell are headed to the Smithsonian.Kevorkian told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta in 2010 that serving eight years in prison had not changed his view of assisted suicide.'It's a medical service,' he said.'It's not political. It's not religious.'
