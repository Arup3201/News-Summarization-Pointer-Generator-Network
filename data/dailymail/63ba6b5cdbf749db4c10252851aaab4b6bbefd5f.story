A northern Michigan woman who tried to kill herself and her autistic 14-year-old daughter in a botched murder-suicide was sentenced to 10 to 22 years in prison.

Kelli Stapleton, of Beulah, Michigan, pleaded guilty last month to first-degree child abuse after originally being charged with attempted murder.

Circuit Judge James Batzer ordered Stapleton to serve a minimum of 10 years earlier today, and said she will get credit for the 399 days she's already served.

Poor choice: The 46-year-old mom drove her daughter Isabelle to an isolated location in September of 2013, gave her sleep-inducing medication and ignited charcoal in two grills inside a van

He set her maximum sentence at 22 years. 

Forensic psychiatrist Carole Lieberman, who examined Stapleton in July, testified that Stapleton was suffering from post-traumatic stress and bipolar disorders and was legally insane when attempting the murder-suicide 

The 46-year-old defendant drove her daughter Isabelle to an isolated location in September 2013, gave her sleep-inducing medication and ignited charcoal in two grills inside a van. 

She and Isabelle survived, but her daughter sustained brain damage. 

They were discovered after her husband Matthew called to report the two missing. 

Authorities say Isabelle, who is now 15, has since recovered.

Conflicted woman: Stapleton was an advocate for autism awareness and kept a blog, The Status Woe, that described the challenges of finding and affording proper treatment for Isabelle

Doing better: Isabelle, pictured here with her father Matthew, is now doing better

Stapleton was an advocate for autism awareness and kept a blog, The Status Woe, that described the challenges of finding and affording proper treatment for Isabelle, who was prone to violent outbursts. 

Friends described her as a loving and caring mother.
