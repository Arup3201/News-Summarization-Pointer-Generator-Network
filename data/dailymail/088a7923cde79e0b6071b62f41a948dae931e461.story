Vodafone will avoid paying any UK tax on huge profits it will make after it sealed one of the largest corporate deals in history yesterday.

But thousands of its shareholders will be hammered with a hefty bill on the windfall they will receive.

The company is set to gain £84billion from selling its stake in US mobile phone company Verizon Wireless.

But due to a loophole introduced under Labour, Vodafone cannot be forced to pay anything to HM Revenue and Customs.

The deal will also provide Vodafone with additional cash to pursue its expansion ambitions in Europe

Shareholders – including a large number of pension funds – will receive more than £54billion from the deal.

As well as a dividend, on which they will have to pay full tax, investors will also be given shares in Verizon Communications – the US giant which is buying the Verizon Wireless stake from Vodafone.

MP Margaret Hodge said: ¿I don¿t understand how anyone can justify such a massive windfall without handing any of it to the Exchequer'

They will face paying capital gains tax if they sell these shares.

It means more than half a million private Vodafone shareholders will face a tax bill while the corporate giant will pay nothing itself in Britain.

Higher rate taxpayers face paying at least 25 per cent of the dividend in tax, though some  basic and lower rate taxpayers may not be taxed at all.

Companies that receive the dividends will not be taxed.

MPs last night demanded Vodafone to ‘do the right thing’ and pay its ‘fair share’.

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, who has led a probe into the tax affairs of Google, Starbucks and Amazon, said: ‘I don’t understand how anyone can justify such a massive windfall without handing any of it to the Exchequer.

‘If this is an instance in which Vodafone has simply played the system then clearly they themselves have an obligation to UK consumers, on whom they depend for their business, to do the right thing.’

The deal by Vodafone, to sell its entire US operations, is the third biggest in corporate history.

It will offload its 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless in a deal that is being structured through a holding company based in the Netherlands – although it is not clear whether this helps it avoid tax. Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao said: ‘This is not a situation that is comparable to Google and Starbucks.

‘Even if this deal happened in the UK 
the rules in place for many years are the same as the Netherlands. There
is no taxable income for the company.’

It is not the first time the company has been embroiled in a tax scandal in the UK.

Vodaphone shares jumped nearly 7 per cent after the sale was announced

Vodafone CEO Vittorio Colao said the sale will mean a 'very substantial return to shareholders and to the investments relied upon by savers and pensioners'

Last year the group was criticised for paying no corporation tax despite raking in profits of £294million on sales of more than £5billion. For years the company has used a host of tax breaks to cut its bill.

Under rules that existed until 2002, Vodafone would have had to pay capital gains tax on the profits it had made while holding Verizon Wireless shares

But Gordon Brown, then Chancellor, introduced an exemption allowing firms that owned more than 10 per cent of another company to avoid paying capital gains tax when they sell.
