When builder Lowson Robinson retired he decided to scale down his activities - quite literally.

The 67-year-old, who could claim to be Britain's smallest builder, has created three miniature villages in his garden.

He has also created a 12ft high model of Big Ben so he doesn't lose track of time when pottering outdoors.

Creator: Retired builder Lowson Robinson has downsized and has focused his attention on miniature buildings in his own garden

Grandeur: Not content with resting in his retirement he decided to carry on building, but on a smaller scale. The dome on this building was modelled on St Paul's Cathedral, London

Lowson, of Nenthead, Cumbria, said: 'I have been working all my life outside and I cannot just sit in the house and watch the television.

'That's why I decided to build the miniature houses as it gives me something to do.

'So far I have built three different villages on my lawn, all around 15ft in size.

'One of the villages is a miniature version of Nenthead where I live.

'The second village is made using local stone from Keswick and Penrith and is based on houses I've seen in the Lake District.

'The third village is based on nice houses I have seen all over the country.'Â 

His phenomenal attention to detail goes into every building, from small cottages like this one, to larger grand buildings that resemble iconic institutions

This is a replica of one of the houses in Lowson's village of Nenthead, which he has recreated in his garden

The retired builder's handy-work has now become a big hit with tourists, who stop to take photos.

Lowson first began building the villages 22-years-ago as a hobby, using his garage as a workshop.

He initially obtained planning permission to build six houses on his land.

However after building three, Lowson 
decided to use the rest of his land to build a garage and began 
producing miniature houses during the evenings and weekends to fill his 
garden.

Although his first miniature house took him around a month it build, it wasn't long before Lowson developed a mould which allows him to create a house in two days.

The buildings, which have plastic windows, are made by filling a square mould with concrete.

His latest work involves building a mansion based on Haughton Hall, in Shropshire, and a water feature which operates through a sensor when visitors pass.

He takes great care to maintain the village gardens as well as the local pubs, churches, mills and waterways. The grand pillared building to his left was based on Shropshire's Haughton hall

Attention to detail: Lowson devotes his time now to making every inch of his miniature villages as realistic as possible

Practical: Since he doesn't like to wear a watch while working, Lowson decided to build his own Big Ben so he could always check the time while toiling away

Work in progress: Lowson said he has no plans to stop building his miniature villages any time soon

As for his 12ft high Big Ben, Lowson 
said: 'I don't like wearing a watch when I am working in the garden so I
built Big Ben so I would know what the time was.

'It has four actual clocks inside and it took me around 12 weeks to make.'

Lowson, who also worked as a coal miner in County Durham, admits the villages have become an attraction for visitors.

He said: 'I think it makes the garden look nice and it also a bit of an attraction.

'It's a bit of interest for people passing through.

'It is surprising the amount of people who stop and ask questions.

'I get pleasure out of seeing people passing and taking pictures.

Running out of space: Sat behind a replica of Nenthead's Crooked House (front left), Lowson said: 'My lawn is not big enough to make any more villages so I am just dotting the houses I make around the garden now.'

Tourists stop and gawp at the incredible creations Lowson has built on his lawn, taking photos of his idyllic settlements

Devotion: Lowson spends most of his time in his garage building new homes: 'I think the longer I live the more I will make.'

And he has no plans to stop making miniature buildings anytime soon.

Lowson said: 'My lawn is not big enough to make any more villages so I am just dotting the houses I make around the garden now.

'They will probably all join together one day.

'I don't know how many I want to make, I think the longer I live the more I will make.

'I will be making them until I drop down dead.'

It's not quite Jurassic Park - but Ivan Ewart is still proud of the huge velociraptor in the front garden of his semi in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

Crowds have been flocking to visit a prehistoric predator that answers to the name of Zach.

Ivan said: 'Ever since he pitched up here, he has had hundreds of visitors. I get at least four knocks at the door a day from people asking me if they can play with my dinosaur, it's quite odd.

The owner says he was given the model as a gift from a friend who used to keep Zach in his bar

The dinosaur is now a useful landmark for people returning from a night out in Bolton

'People go mad for him, they stop in their cars to take pictures and I have heard he has even got his own Facebook page.'

He says he was given the model as a gift from a friend who used to keep Zach in his bar.

Now he's a useful landmark for people returning from a night out.

'Taxi drivers have told me they get a lot of people who live near here asking to be taken to where the dinosaur is on Crompton Way,' said Ivan.

''So he is helping out in that way.'
