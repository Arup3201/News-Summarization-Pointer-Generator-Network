Depositions in the sexual assault case of a Missouri teenager who claimed she was raped by a school friend show contradictions in statements between the girl and her mother.

The special prosecutor in the case released depositions on Friday of Daisy Coleman and her mother, Melinda, taken in July 2012.

In more than 100 pages of testimony, the Colemans described the night in January 2012 when Daisy, who was 14 at the time, claims she was raped.

Contradictions: Newly released documents appear to suggest Melinda Coleman and her daughter gave differing statements to police

Jackson County prosecuting attorney Jean Peters Baker served as special prosecutor after Nodaway County Prosecutor Robert Rice asked for someone else to review the evidence amid questions about why he dropped charges against the alleged attacker.

The testimony describes how Daisy and a female friend had been drinking before asking Matt Barnett, then 17, to pick them up after they sneaked out of Daisy's home.

Daisy claimed Barnett took her to his house, plied her with alcohol and raped her when she blacked out.

Mrs Coleman found her daughter shivering on the front porch at about 5am the next day.

According to the depositions released on Friday, Mrs Coleman told Rice that Daisy had been less than truthful on some things in her deposition and attributed that to the girl's embarrassment over the ordeal.

For example, Rice at one point had asked Daisy about an incident in which she burned the name of a boy into her skin.

Mrs Coleman said that it was Barnett's name; Daisy said in her deposition that it was another boy's name.

At one point, the mother suggested that the contradictions would likely keep the case out of a courtroom.

'I don't think that you probably can try this case now. I think there's been too many lies,' she said, according to the newly released documents.

The Colemans and their supporters later claimed Rice dropped a felony assault charge against Barnett because of insensitivity, prosecutorial ambivalence and political pressure from the boy's grandfather, a retired state trooper and four-term state legislator.

Mrs Coleman told The Associated Press on Friday that she hadn't seen the depositions, which she claimed Rice had denied even existed, and she didn't believe some of what was purported to be in them.

'Quite frankly, Robert Rice is a liar and I wouldn't be surprised if he put that in there himself,' Mrs Coleman said.

Daisy's story made headlines nationwide after The Kansas City Star published a 4,000-word article in October detailing the girl's claims against Barnett.

The AP generally doesn't name the victims of sexual assault but it is naming Daisy because she and her mother granted public interviews.

In January, Barnett pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment after Baker concluded there wasn't enough evidence for a felony conviction.

Barnett has not denied the two had sex, but has insisted that it was consensual.

Robert Sundell, an attorney who initially represented Barnett after he was charged, said on Friday he was glad the documents were released.

'If all of the records and all of the evidence were made public, I think it would be pretty easy for anyone to recognize why the case didn't go forward,' he said.
