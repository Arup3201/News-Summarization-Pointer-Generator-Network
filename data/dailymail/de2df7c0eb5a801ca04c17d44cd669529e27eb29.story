Charges have finally been filed in the murder case of a 28-year-old Kirkland, Washington woman who prophesized her own untimely death.

Amy Hargrove was found dead in her bed on January 6, after spending the weekend reuniting with her abusive boyfriend Burrell Cushman, 28.

The young mother tragically died after expressing concern her boyfriend, father to her toddler son, would ultimately kill her.

'A piece of paper isn’t going to save my life when he finally gets me, but at least you will know who killed me,' Hargrove wrote in a 2012 restraining order petition against Cushman.

'A piece of paper isn't going to save my life...but at least you will know who killed me,' are the words Hargrove (right) wrote in a 2012 restraining order against Cushman (center). She let the father of her toddler son back into her life last November, when the no-contact order was still in place

While Cushman was initially considered a person of interest in the homicide, he wasn't officially arrested in the case until Thursday. On Tuesday, Cushman was charged with second-degree murder in King County Superior Court and is currently being held on $1.5million bond.

Investigators said it took a while to gather enough evidence to arrest Cushman, who admitted to spending the weekend with Hargrove but said he never hurt her.

Police spokesman Mike Murray explained the several months it took to arrest Cushman, saying investigators had to rule out other suspects and wait on crime lab tests results.

Hargrove had recently moved back into her childhood home to escape Burrell, but that didn't last for long.

Around November, she reunited with the boyfriend because he was the father of one of her children.

But even then, she admitted to Cushman's mom that she regretted the decision.

'I cannot stand up for myself of get away from him now without a major disaster,' she texted Cushman's mother, according to a police affidavit.

'I'm scared that I'm not going to live through this once hell (sic) kill me,' she wrote.

Hargrove's worst fears were allegedly realized the weekend of January 4-5 when the couple left their son with Cushman's mom for some alone time.

Hargrove appears to have been killed sometime on January 5, since records show she stopped using her phone and using social media.

That afternoon, Cushman called his mother crying about a fight he had with his girlfriend and told her: 'Mom, I got a bad feeling about tonight'.

Hargrove's mother was the one who found her daughter's body, bruised and cold to the touch the next day. 

A medical examiner ruled that Hargrove died from suffocation.

Denials: Cushman told police he left Hargrove's house on January 5, and last saw her alive, smoking marijuana by the slider door

Won't stop: In addition to the murder charges, Cushman is also the subject of a domestic abuse  investigation for allegedly punching his new, pregnant, girlfriend in the stomach last month. Pictured with Hargrove above

Police responding to the scene found a 'red hot' pan on the stove in the kitchen covered in cooking oil from floor to ceiling.

Hargrove's body was partially covered with a blanked that was also draped over a space heater placed up hugh next to the bed, according to the affidavit.

Police found no sign of forced entry, robbery or sexual assault. Investigators found DNA belonging to Cushman underneath her fingernails.

Cushman was questioned after Hargrove's body was found, and admitted to spending the weekend with her but denied hurting her.

He told police that he and Hargrove 'argued multiple times because of his "wandering eye". Cushman said he left Hargrove's room the afternoon of January 5, and the last time he saw his girlfriend she 'was alive, sitting and smoking marijuana by the slider door and yelling at him.'

In addition to the murder charges, Cushman is also the subject of a domestic assault investigation for allegedly punching his new, pregnant, girlfriend in the stomach last month.

Cushman is a three-time convicted felon, with convictions including third-degree assault, first-degree negligent driving and attempting to elude law enforcement.

In the 2012 restraining order petition, Hargrove claimed Cushman beat her on a regular basis (even when she was pregnant with his child), raped her at gunpoint and forced her to have sex with one of his relatives.

Cushman is set to be arraigned on July 22.
