For his latest public relations stunt North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un has toured an army rations factory - during which he was pictured happily relaxing while barking orders at his subordinates.

Pictures from the tour show Jong-Un inspecting products at the factory as he is followed by an eager entourage of confidantes, advisers and yes-men.

During the visit, the young despot inspected the factory's production control room, dissemination room and combined processing workshop to learn about how it is attempting to modernise.

Unsurprisingly, the lab coat-clad leader is show in various  poses, taking centre stage as he inspects how the products are made.

Surrounding him are dozens of men, most of whom are carrying notepads and pens in order to write down his orders.

Photos of the visit have been released from the secretive authoritarian state as it is revealed he is planning to send a personal envoy to Russia, state media said yesterday.

It is the latest  in a series of diplomatic moves by the isolated country as it fends off accusations of crimes against humanity.

North Korean diplomats have been on a vigorous campaign in recent months to counter a UN resolution urging the country's referral to the International Criminal Court, a move which it has dismissed as part of a U.S.-led plot to destroy its political system.

The short one-paragraph dispatch said Choe Ryong Hae, a high-ranking member of the ruling Workers' Party widely seen as a close confidant of Kim, would visit Russia 'soon', without elaborating further.

A statement on the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website said Choe would visit Moscow on Monday, followed by a visit to the far eastern cities of Khabarovsk and Vladivostok before ending his trip on November 24.

A UN inquiry concluded in a February 17 report that North Korean security chiefs and possibly even Kim himself should face international justice for ordering systematic torture, starvation and killings.

North Korea is already under UN sanctions for repeated nuclear tests and missile launches.

Russia, along with the two Koreas, China, the United States and Japan, were participants in years of so-called six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear programme which came to nothing.

There has been increased diplomatic activity between Russia and North Korea in recent months.

Russia shares a short, remote land border with North Korea and has in recent years completed the refurbishment of a railway line and seaport in the north east of North Korea.

The two sides plan to discuss enhanced trade and economic cooperation, as well as 'international issues of common interest,' the Russian statement said.

Choe met Chinese President Xi Jinping last year as an official envoy of Kim Jong-Un, and made a surprise trip to South Korea in October as part of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games.
