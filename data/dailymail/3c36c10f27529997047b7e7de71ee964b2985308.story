She has won three British Style Awards and was even dubbed 'beautiful' and a 'phenomenon' by Karl Lagerfeld and Anna Wintour.

So what's Alexa Chung's secret?

'Since turning 30, I haven't really changed my attitude towards health. I'm still smoking like a chimney.

'Its not going to happen overnight because I've only been 30 for like, a week. But approaching 30, I started thinking about being healthier. I've started doing ballet and being conscious of what I put in my body. Oh, and I eat fish oils now as well,' the model told MailOnline.

The TV presenter and fashionista was speaking at the launch of her cosmetics line with indie brand Eyeko, which lands in Selfridges today.

In her new role as Creative Consultant at Eyeko, Alexa has used her beauty know-how, as well as her illustrative and photographic talents, to custom-design the first in a line of limited edition sets.

To launch the range the star has created a thick nib eyeliner and a mascara so that beauty aficionados can re-create her signature cat flick eyes.

Sharing her top tips for achieving the iconic Alexa flick, she said: 'I started doing this cat eye flick when I was about 17 and I do it every single day, so I've had years of practice.

Cool as a cucumber: Alexa, who donned an all-black ensemble an on-trend Charlotte Olympia pumps, says her beauty icon is Brigitte Bardot

'I do the outside flick first, just one line, then see if they're even and level then I'll just draw the rest in to match it but sometimes I do it too thick and have to start again; I am obsessed with perfecting it. My record time is about a minute and half on a good day,' she said.

Alexa hopes her new products, which have quirky names such as 'eye do' liquid eyeliner, will help her fans emulate her look.

Speaking about her eyeliner, she said: 'The nib is the perfect shape and size to give you control. It gives you the precision to draw on the perfect cat eye.

'It’s pitch black and waterproof so 
it doesn’t move even on the waterline. I love that it enhances my lashes
each time I use it.'

Speaking
about her mascara, which is packed with Vitamins A & E, Keratin, 
Ginkgo Biloba and botanical proteins that claim to promote lash growth, 
she said: 'I love a Sixties doe-eyed look and this gives me longer, 
thicker, blacker lashes without the hassle of falsies.

'It stays on forever but feels amazing thanks to all the lash enhancing magic in the mix.'

Quirky: Alexa has created the eye make-up and the packaging herself and it comes complete with kooky sketches

She cites her all-time beauty icon as Brigitte Bardot but says she's 'too selfish' to think of a modern day version (although she would love to raid Dame Edna's beauty bag).

Despite being one of fashion's most famous muses, who has taken home the British Style Award at the British Fashion Awards for three consecutive years, Alexa isn't up for a gong this time around - but she isn't too bothered.

'I have won it for the past three years, which is great but it's nice that other people are up for it this time around. 

'At least I don’t have to do a speech, which I've been very awkward about giving the last three years.

'Also I think it's quite a good indication of fashion and how it moves, how you're in and you’re out. Maybe in ten years time people will start wearing me again!'.

2013 will see Harry Styles and Dermot O'Leary take on Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss for the title - and it's the men who've got Alexa's vote.

'I would love to see Harry win. Dermot O'leary's on the list, I'd love to see him win. Let's give it to him., he's got a lovely suit.'

Alexa, who turned 30 earlier this week, celebrated with celebrity friends Harry Styles, Kelly Osbourne and Nick Grimshaw in the trendy Edition Hotel.

'My birthday was epic. Endless. Good cake. The thing about that cake was we didn’t cut it, which was weird.

'People in the morning just scooped fistfuls of it into their mouths. When I walked past the cake in the morning it was literally as if a gang of children had come and attacked. So that was nice,' she said.

Alexa, who counts herself as a 
Contributing Editor to British Vogue and Style Ambassador for the 
British Fashion Council, seems set on building an empire.

She recently turned author and penned a book - titled It - which invites fashion fans into her stylish world.

And now with a book under her belt, Alexa says she is keen to develop her career further, with forays into music and acting.

Alexa Chung for Eyeko will cost £35 per set and be exclusively pre-launched at 
Selfridges, Oxford Street London on November 14 where she will be meeting and greeting fans.

Desperate to emulate Alexa's signature cat flick eyeliner and smokey eyed look, FEMAIL writer Bianca London put her new range to the test...

'A lot of girls want to look like Alexa, she has that "just rolled out of bed" indie girl style so when she unveiled her debut make-up range, we were keen to give it a spin.

The mascara is good, very thick and lasts all day and it's good to know that it's helping to condition your lashes whilst you wear it.

It's pretty tough to get off though, we recommend using a gentle eye make-up remover like The Body Shop's Camomile Kind Eye remover as it can be quite stubborn.

As for the eyeliner, if you have the knack for applying it, it looks great. However, it is very, very black so may be too heavy on some fair-haired ladies.

The packaging is what wins us over and would be great as a Christmas stocking filler.'
