He is known as a reclusive street artist who spends his time secretly painting urban art murals on walls around Britain and beyond.

So it was rather ironic of Banksy to say it was ‘disgusting people are allowed to go around displaying art on walls without getting permission’.

He made the comments in a statement disassociating himself from a new exhibition of his artistic creations that have been removed from walls.

On show: Workers construct pseudonymous British graffiti artist Banksy's artwork 'No Ball Games' at the Stealing Banksy exhibition in London yesterday

Brace Yourself: The selection of street art has gone on show at ME Hotel in Central London before being sold at an online auction or via sealed bids on Sunday

The selection of street art has gone 
on show at ME Hotel in Central London before it is sold at an online 
auction or via sealed bids on Sunday.

Among the seven works included in the sale are ‘Berlin Door’, ‘No Ball Games’, ‘Liverpool Rat’ and ‘Girl With Balloon’.

The
 artist, who has kept his identity a closely guarded secret and often 
paints his wall murals at night, said he had no connection with the 
sale.

A statement on 
www.banksy.co.uk said: ‘The “Stealing Banksy” exhibition in London this 
weekend has been organised without the involvement or consent of the 
artist. Banksy would like to make it clear.

'This
 show has got nothing to do with me and I think it's disgusting people 
are allowed to go around displaying art on walls without getting 
permission.’

The Sincura Group, which organised the
 exhibition and auction, said it only removed the work after being 
approached by building owners.

It
 said the presence of a work by the mysterious artist on a building 
often left owners with ‘the very real risk of having a Grade II listing 
applied to their premises which seriously affects their business 
operations and resale value’.

They added: ‘Though loved by the public, these Banksys are often a liability to the building owners.’

Among the work being auctioned is a painting originally done on the side of a lorry at the Glastonbury Festival.

Earlier
 this year, one of the artist's most famous works sold at auction in the
 US after being removed from the wall of a Brighton pub.

Kissing
 Coppers, a life-size black and white graffiti work of two policemen 
kissing, was sold to an anonymous buyer in Miami for $575,000 
(£345,000).

It was spray-painted on the side of the Prince Albert pub in Trafalgar Street near Brighton city centre in 2004.

Will
 Ellsworth-Jones, the author of Banksy: The Man Behind the Wall, said it
 was ‘fascinating’ to see the works gathered together in one place.

He said Banksy's anonymity was part of his art, saying: ‘Originally he had to be anonymous because he'd get arrested.

Liverpool Rat: Another work on display - pictured here in its original location - is a giant rat painted on the wall of a Liverpool pub

Girl With Balloon: A stencil of a girl with a balloon from an East London wall is being shown at the exhibition, and will be auctioned off on Sunday

‘Now I think people would be embarrassed if they arrested him and it helps him market the art’.

But Mr Ellsworth-Jones said the artist would not be impressed with the sale, saying: ‘He would much prefer the art if necessary to be destroyed rather than taken off and sold like this’.

Sincura
 was criticised last year for handling the sale of a Bansky mural whose 
removal from the wall of a north London store dismayed many locals.

The
 works on show now include an image of two children playing with a ‘No Ball Games’ 
sign which was cut off of a shop wall in London last year.

Sincura, which has valued the work at £1million, said proceeds from its sale will go to unspecified local charities.

Banksy's works have been commanding higher prices as he has become better known to collectors in the US and in continental Europe.

At a recent event in London held by an art exchange that allows investors to buys shares in works of art, one of the most sought-after pieces was a stenciled painting on canvas by Banksy called ‘Heavy Artillery’ that features an elephant weighed down by a missile strapped to its back.

Its 1,000 shares were listed at £120 ($200) each. Banksy spokesman Jo Brooks confirmed the message posted on www.banksy.co.uk was genuine.
