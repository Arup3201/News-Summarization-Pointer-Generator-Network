It's long been said that curiosity kills the cat.

But one inquisitive Swiss photographer has brought a selection of adorable felines to life - by morphing them into their doting owners.

This amazing series of photographs produced by Sebastian Magnani splices the head and shoulders of 15 different owners with the portrait of their favourite moggy.

Purr-fect unison! Photographer Sebastian Magnani has blended together photos of cats and their owners. This incredible image, left, shows cat Blue merged with his owner, Miriam, who is pictured right

In a series called 'Undercats', the Swiss photographer merged 15 owners with their favourite felines. In this combination, cat Salem is merged with his owner Mariette - both donning the same helmet

The 28-year-old used expert photo-manipulation techniques to seamlessly transplant the feline faces onto the human bodies. Here, cat Figaro is spliced with young cap-wearing owner Elia, who is pictured right

Using his friends, family and strangers, the 28-year-old - who says he is fascinated with cats' eyes - cleverly photographed owners and their respective pets in the same portrait style.

He then used expert photo-manipulation techniques on the computer to seamlessly transplant the feline faces onto the human bodies.

Highlights of the series, which is called Undercats,
 include a lady called Daniela's hair blending perfectly with the face 
of her ginger cat Micky while, in another picture, owner Mariette and her cat Salem don the same crash helmet.

There's even a photo of the photographer's father Ermano, with the face of his cat Jaguar, wearing a headset.

Undercats follows Sebastian's 
internationally-renowned - and similarly-themed - Underdogs set. Here, 
he has blended cat Paraya, left with owner Christoph, pictured right

Headphone wearing Ermano, pictured right, who is
 the father of the photographer, is merged with his cat Jaguar.  For 
this project, the photographer travelled for a week around Switzerland 
visiting the owner's home to photograph them and their cats

owner Natalie. The photographer used family, friends, strangers who 
answered his Facebook post and people who contacted him directly via 
email for the project

The series follows Sebastian's internationally-renowned collection Underdogs, which, in a similar vein, saw the faces of dogs superimposed onto their owner's.

For
 this project, the young photographer travelled for a week around Switzerland visiting the 
owner's home to capture the images.

He said: 'One is my father Ermano. Some are friends of mine. Some answered me on my Facebook post. Some 
contacted me directly per email.'

Sebastian says splicing of the humans and pets took about three weeks of his free time, with 6-8 hours spent on each image. In this set of images, cat Uschi is spliced with owner Jan

The photographer started the project because he said he is fascinated with the eyes of cats. Here, cat Mogli is blended perfectly with owner Josianne

Sebastian said: 'It is in the eye of the beholder whether cats look like their owners like people say dogs do. But for me the eyes so strong and characterful'. Here, cat Juna is blended with owner Christian

The photographer said he knew he wanted to experiment with cats after doing his dog series. Here, cat Hector is mixed with long-haired owner Joana

The photographer says splicing of the humans and pets took about three weeks of his free time, with each image taking between six and eight hours to perfect.

Sebastian said: 'When I'd made the first part of my Underdogs, for me it was 
clear, I wanted to create the same with cats. And I was really looking 
forward to see more combinations. I am also so fascinated by the eyes of
 cats.

'Unlike dogs, cats all the same head form, so there is not so much difference between each other. It
 is in the eye of the beholder whether cats look like their owners like 
people say dogs do. But for me the eyes so strong and characterful.

'I
 think the title Undercats is not the same as Underdogs, it has a softer
 meaning and that's the reason why I've chosen the title.'
