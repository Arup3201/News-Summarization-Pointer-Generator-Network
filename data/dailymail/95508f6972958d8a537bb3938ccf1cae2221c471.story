Her sudden death left the rock star devastated.

But today Sir Mick Jagger has announced plans to establish a scholarship in honor of his late girlfriend, fashion designer L'Wren Scott.

The scholarship will allow one master's degree student per year over a period of three years to attend the elite Central Saint Martins, the London-based college said this weekend.

Scott, who committed suicide last March in her New York apartment at age 49, had been close to a former course director at Central Saint Martins, the late Louise Wilson.

Fabio Piras, the current course director of MA Fashion, said in a statement that he was 'very grateful to receive this extremely generous scholarship package.' 

The grant covers tuition and some living expenses.

And it will be a fitting tribute to the designer who made an international name for herself.  

She
 first broke into the fashion industry as a stylist before launching an 
eponymous line in 2006 that was a major hit with celebrities.

Fans included Oprah Winfrey, Nicole Kidman and Michelle Obama. She had even been tipped to design Angelina Jolie's wedding dress.

Loss: The Rolling Stones frontman published a statement on his website soon after L'Wren Scott's death saying he was struggling to understand why she would end her life

Jagger and the Mormon-raised designer had been dating since 2001 and a representative confirmed the pair were still in a relationship when she took her life.

The Rolling Stones frontman was in Perth, Western Australia when news of his longtime partner's death reached him.

Jagger said through a spokesperson that he was 'completely shocked and devastated' after hearing the news. 

Reports suggested that the 49-year-old fashion designer was $6 million in debt to her creditors when she died and was distraught and 'embarrassed' over her failing business. 

However, a spokesman for the British Fashion Council said: 'She was an iconic woman who inspired so many, and a designer whose contributions to the fashion industry were both extraordinary and unique.'
