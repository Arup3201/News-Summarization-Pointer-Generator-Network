William Luckett, 15, died from an allergic reaction to a chinese takeaway

A 15-year-old boy with a severe nut allergy died minutes after eating barbecue spare ribs from a Chinese takeaway that had been marinated in peanut sauce.

William Luckett, 15, took two bites of the ribs and died as his father Steven rushed him to hospital.

William, from Newent, Gloustershire, had been visiting his father, Steven, on the Isle of Wight for the Christmas holidays when they decided to get William's favourite meal on December 29.

They ordered dishes from Hong Kong Express, near where postman Steven lives in Brading.

After two mouthfuls William, who attended Newent Community College and Sixth Form, said he was feeling unwell.

An inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned but it is believed that the teenager died from a serious allergic reaction to peanuts used to prepare the ribs.

The restaurant today maintains that peanut was included as an ingredient on the menu next to the dish.

William's distraught mother Helen Stiles said today that her son would not have eaten the dish if he had known that it contained peanuts.

Mum-of-five Ms Stiles, 43, who spoke to her son 90 minutes before his death, said: 'Healways ordered the same things - duck in plum sauce and barbecue spare ribs.

'I have since discovered the restaurant they ordered from is the only one in that chain which prepares spare ribs with peanut sauce.

'If Will or his father had even the slightest suspicion the food contained nuts, they would have asked.

'Will took two mouthfuls of rib and told his father he was feeling ill. He went to the toilet and when he came back he was covered in a rash.

'His father said he better get to the hospital, so Will started putting his shoes on. All the while he kept saying "sorry dad" like it was his fault.

He died minutes after eating barbecue ribs from a Chinese takeaway - which unbeknown to him had been marinated in peanut sauce

The Chinese restaurant which sold the barbecue ribs today insisted that the dish is clearly labelled as containing peanuts on the menu.

Michael Hang, manager of Hong Kong Express in Ryde - where William's father boughtthe takeaway - claimed ribs were always prepared in the sauce.

He said:'I am really very sorry to hear about this. All the restaurants' ribs come with peanut sauce. Every Chinese restaurant does this.

'We have allergy information on all of our takeaway menus, it clearly says peanuts next to the ribs.

'If a customer has allergies then they have to tell us and we are very careful not to include what they are allergic to in the dish.

'I know how important it is because my son has allergies.'

'That's the type of kind-hearted person my son was. They left the house, he was walking and talking, but minutes after he got into the car, he collapsed and died.'

William, who suffered from Asperger's Syndrome, suffered his first reaction to peanuts at the age of four after eating a Maryland peanut cookie.

His worried parents rushed Will to hospital after he turned while and developed rashes and doctors diagnosed him with a peanut intolerance.

A  year later, William mistakenly ate a peanut M&M sweet and was prescribed an Epi pen - which gives a boost of adrenaline to stop or slow an allergic reaction - after being rushed to hospital.

Helen added: "Ever since then, I made sure we never had peanuts in the house. I checked everything we ate, and he learned himself.

'Whenever trying something new, he would always ask if there were nuts in stuff. It's such a tragedy. Barbecue ribs were his favourite food - he ate them all the time.

'The week before he went to see his dad we went out for a meal and he ordered them then.'

Helen believes that William, who also lives with stepdad Andy Stiles, brothers Joseph, 17, Hayden, 10, Toby, eight and sister Jess, two, had eaten from the Hong Kong Express chain of restaurants on the island before. 

She estimates that William ate around six Chinese takeaways after the family moved to the village of Cliffords Mesne, Glos., in 2011.

Allergies can develop from food intolerances and William had not been tested since childhood - meaning his family did not know how severe a reaction could be.

Newent Community School in Gloucestershire said they planned to hold a memorial concert in memory of Year 11 prefect William Luckett

His mother said: 'If he had had his epi pen on him, it may not have made any difference. He had such a severe reaction that by the time he got help it may have been too late.

'It could happen to anybody. I want to make people more aware.

'To die over something so stupid and trivial as peanut butter is a tragedy. It is so tragic because he had his whole life ahead of him.'

Jane Steele, headteacher of the Newent Community College and Sixth Form, said: 'He will be greatly missed by the staff and students who worked with

'We were aware he had a nut intolerance.

'From previous experience, eating nuts would make him sick.

'He used to be very careful and sensible about what he ate and would refuse biscuits or cakes if they were handed out at after-school rehearsals.'

The school plans to hold a memorial concert in William's memory.

William moved to the area from the Isle of Wight with his mum, 
stepdad, three brothers and sister in July 2011.

A spokeswoman for the FSA could not comment on individual cases but said restaurants were not bound to display allergy information by law.

She said: 'Current legislation that requires declaration of allergenic ingredients used in pre-packed foods, does not apply to foods sold
non-prepacked.

'So currently, when eating out, it is up to consumers with food allergies to ask for information about the ingredients used in the foods that want to buy so that they can make safe food choices.'

'However the general provisions of the Food Safety Act 1990 do require that any information provided about food has to be accurate and not misleading.

'If a catering business said that a food did not contain nut ingredients, when in fact it did, this would be illegal and possible enforcement actions could be taken.'

She said new EU legislation which requires food allergens to be displayed on non-prepacked food would come into effect in December this year.

It comes after reports late last year revealed 18-year-old student, Emma Egerton, died after eating just one mouthful of takeaway chicken tikka korma.

The korma from Manchester's Spice of India restaurant had been cooked in nut oil and contained ground almonds.

The
student, who was alone at the time,
dialled 999 and left her front door open for the ambulance crews to get 
in but was unconscious by the time they arrived and she died in hospital the same night.

The inquest heard there was no warning on the menu that the dish she chose may contain nuts.

Another
student with a nut allergy almost died last year after eating a ‘nut 
free' cake which actually contained 55 per cent peanuts.

Student Preethi Koshy, 22, suffered an allergic reaction from the marble cake and spent three days on a life support machine.
