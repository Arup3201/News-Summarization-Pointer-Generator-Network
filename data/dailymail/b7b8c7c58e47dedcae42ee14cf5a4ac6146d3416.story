Ryan Gauld admits he’s stunned to be the only Scot in the Champions League group stages this season after his shock inclusion in the Sporting Lisbon squad.

The former Dundee United starlet has been named in the Portuguese giants’ A squad list for this season’s European campaign, despite only playing for their B team so far since his summer move from Tannadice.

And, incredibly, with Celtic already out of the tournament and Darren Fletcher’s Manchester United having not even qualified, it means the 18-year-old attacking midfielder dubbed Baby Messi during his emergence in Tayside is set to be this country’s sole represenative on the biggest club stage of all.

Gauld celebrated the news with his first goals at Under 21 level when his double helped Billy Stark’s side end their European Championship campaign on a high with a 3-0 win in Luxembourg - following on from last week’s 1-1 draw away to group winners Slovakia.

But he was clearly still shocked to have been presented with even a remote chance by Sporting Lisbon of making an appearance against Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea, Schalke 04 and Celtic’s conquerors Maribor in Group G of this season’s European club spectacular.

Gauld, who signed a six-year contract with the Portuguese giants in the summer for a fee thought to be in the region of £3million, with a buy-out clause of £47.8million eye-catchingly inserted, said of his inclusion in the Sporting Lisbon squad: ‘I heard about it through Twitter, actually. It’s great to be in the squad and hopefully at some point I can maybe even be a part of it in games.

‘I was actually quite surprised because I’ve been playing with the B team. The A team have got a lot of depth and strength in the team so when the news did come out I was quite surprised.

‘There was no indication from the manager Marco Silva because I think the draw was just a couple of days before I came back so there wasn’t too much said about it. They were just going about it week by week so I’m just delighted with being named in the squad and I’m looking forward to it.

‘I can only keep doing my best and keep doing what I try and do best and keep plugging away to make sure I am in his thoughts.

‘To be involved in any way would be a great experience and something I would remember for a long time.

‘But at the same time I’m not expecting anything. I’m keeping things realistic and I’m not hoping for too much, too soon.

‘There have been a lot of new experiences just in the couple of months or so that I’ve been there - and there have been a lot of challenges as well. ‘I’m sure there will be more to come and I can only look forward to it.’

Now Gauld - who was mobbed by Sporting Lisbon autograph hunters after the game in Luxembourg - has to deal with the really difficult bit - getting tickets for the Champions League matches for his mates.

He admitted: ‘I’ve already had a couple of requests! I’m sure I’ll hear from a few more of my friends before the games.

‘I’ve also had a few texts congratulating me and it comes up in conversation because I keep in touch with them all. It’s nice for me.’

Gauld believes his experiences in Portugal have already helped him improve his game since his summer move from Tannadice.

Marked man: Gauld emerged as a promising youngster at Dundee United in 2012

Rising star: Gauld is regarded as a big prospect for Scotland 

He said: ‘The tempo of games in Portugal is closer to international games. When you play in the Scottish Premiership and you go away and play in an international game it’s hard to adapt to it really quickly because the speed of the game is much quicker at international level, that’s the main difference.

‘Being in Portugal is making me adapt to that more easily at international level as well.’

Gauld has already been tipped by many observers for a call-up to Gordon Strachan’s side, but is just concentrating on the next campaign for Stark’s Under 21s.

And he’s optimistic about the future for the young Scots.

He said: ‘We’ve played a really young team in both games this last week and that’s promising as we look to the next campaign.

‘Slovakia are a really good outfit and we did very well against them, although obviously conceding in the last minute put us on a bit of a downer. 

‘Luxembourg can make life really difficult for teams - Holland only won here on the back of a penalty - so we can be happy with ourselves scoring three goals and keeping a clean sheet.

‘Everyone obviously gets on very well together and that helps and you are building personal relationships that help on the pitch as well. Everything is looking good towards the next campaign.’
