A mother who was acquitted of killing her ex-husband 20 years ago has been sentenced to up to 41 years for shooting and paralyzing her adult son with the same gun.

Linda Cooney, 66, was found guilty in April of attempted murder, battery with a deadly weapon and intimidating a witness for the June 2011 attack on her son, Kevin, in their Las Vegas home.

On Wednesday, she cried as she was sentenced to 13 to 41 years in prison and told the judge that she had been wrongfully convicted, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported.

It comes more than two decades after she was cleared in the death of her former husband James Cooney on February 7, 1992 amid a bitter divorce battle. She claimed she had shot him in self defense when he came at her with a knife.

Heading to prison: Linda Cooney reacts as she is sentenced to 13 to 41 years in prison for shooting her son

Kevin Cooney's testimony when he was just 11 years old had been key to 
his mother's acquittal, the prosecutor in the case, Peter Magrino, told 
the Sun Sentinel.

He
 had initially told police that his father's hands were empty when he 
saw him killed on the floor, but in the 1993 trial in Palm Beach, 
Florida he said that his father may have been holding something.

In
 2011, she shot Kevin in the neck in Las Vegas with the same .357 Magnum
 after an argument about his girlfriend, whom Linda Cooney had been 
accused of stalking.

Again,
 Cooney, a former legal secretary, claimed she shot out of self defense 
after her 6ft 9 inch son, a bouncer at a local club, had attacked her 
during the argument.

And again - he defended his mother.

Testifying from a motorized chair, he
 said that she had shot him after he attacked her. He said that he 
blamed himself for the incident.

Denial: Cooney said that she had killed her ex-husband James, pictured, in 1992 in self defense

But
 his testimony was at odds with other statements made in the court; an 
ex-girlfriend testified that he told her his mother shot him as he sat 
on the couch.

The 
argument that led to the 2011 shooting came after years of tension over 
Kevin Cooney's girlfriend, Karina Taylor, whom he met in 2009 but did 
not tell his mother.

Taylor
 told authorities his friends had said she should avoid meeting Linda 
Cooney because she was 'crazy and it would cause nothing but problems'.

And when Cooney did finally meet 
Taylor, she was against the relationship - and allegedly sent her a 
series of texts calling her a 'stripper,' 'w****,' 'prostitute' and 
'skank'.

She also 
contacted a non-profit cancer organization where Taylor volunteered and 
said that she was laundering money and dealing drugs, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors added that Taylor was genuinely fearful of Cooney, and this led to the argument on June 28, 2011.

Police
 received two calls alerting them to the scene - one from Cooney and one
 from Kevin's younger brother, Chris, a Las Vegas police officer.

Freed: Her son testified in the 90s that he might have seen his father with a knife and Cooney was freed

Home: They argued over Kevin's girlfriend, whom Linda had allegedly called a 'skank' and 'w****'

But
 the calls came after a 15-minute call between Cooney and Chris. By this
 point, Kevin had been shot and reportedly told his brother he could not
 feel his legs.

When Chris called police, he said that his brother had attacked his mother and that she had shot him, and Linda Cooney called police to say her son had been shot in the neck.

Cooney refused to answer about who was responsible for shooting her son, although at one point said: 'The gun, it's my fault, it's my fault.'

When police arrived, Kevin was lying down with a cloth pressed to the right side of his neck and when they asked him who had shot him, he refused to say - and kept calling it an accident.

Questions were also raised when Linda Cooney contacted her son via a cell phone while he was in hospital.
