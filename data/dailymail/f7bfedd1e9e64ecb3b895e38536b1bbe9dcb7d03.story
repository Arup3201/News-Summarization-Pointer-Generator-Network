An 11-year-old boy has died after heroically saving his seven-year-old sister from drowning as they swam in a creek in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Randez Brown passed away on Thursday night after the incident at Davis Creek and his sister, Samiyah Brown, was listed in critical condition in hospital on Friday morning.

On Thursday evening, the siblings had been playing with several other children jumping from rock to rock at a culvert, which authorities said was as deep as 10 ft in some places.

Samiyah, a second grader, fell into the water and her big brother jumped in after her, friend Breanna Caldwell told the Charlotte Observer.

'I've
 been down there,' she said. 'The water is sometimes rushing really
 fast out of the pipe. It's muddy and easy to get stuck, especially if 
you go too far.'

Emergency crews rushed to the scene and firefights pulled one child out at 8pm and the Fire Department's rescue team found another at 10pm, the fire chief told the Observer.

The children were rushed to Carolinas Medical Center, but Randez Brown passed away late on Thursday night, officials said.

Friends said the fifth-grade student was protective of his little sister.

'If his little sister was in trouble or somebody messed with her, he was there, he really was,' friend Makya Hill told WSOC-TV.

Local children often swim in the creek, which is susceptible to flooding, authorities said.

A spokeswoman for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools said that grief counselors were at Sedgefield Elementary School on Friday to meet with students and staff after the tragedy.
