Insurers could be hit for billions of dollars more than expected after superstorm Sandy was labelled a post-tropical cyclone rather than a hurricane.

Lowering the classification means the insurance providers have to pay more of the costs towards rebuilding the parts of New York and New Jersey which were damaged.

Had Sandy been given hurricane status homeowners would have needed to contribute more towards their costs.

Total rebuild: Insurers will have to pay for houses like these, in area near the coast which burned down during a fire in the midst of the storm, to be rebuilt without claiming hurricane deductions

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service (NWS) made the call which has been contested by insurers, who are estimated to lose between $10-20billion.

'In New York, New Jersey, by all sorts of normal measures, it was a hurricane,' Neil Alldredge, senior vice-president of state and policy affairs at the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, told the Financial Times.

'If you ask any one who lives [in New York or New Jersey] they will tell you it was a hurricane.'

He continued: 'It’s ironic that the industry gets beaten up all the time about the way it hides behind policy language.

'It seems to me that this is what the states are doing: they’re hiding behind this technicality.'

However they may succeed in their bid to challenge the determination of Sandy.

Paul Berger, an attorney at the Hurricane Law Group, told the Financial Times: 'Most courts would have to take judicial notice of the determinations of NOAA and the post tropical declaration would be upheld.

'However, because so much money is involved, I would not be surprised to see the determination challenged.'

A hurricane deductible is usually between 1 per cent and 5 per cent of the value of the property - which means homeowners would have to pay thousands of dollars before the insurers covered the rest.

But a storm deductible is usually a fixed figure between $500 and $1000 - considerably less.

For instance, if a house was valued at $400,000 a hurricane deductible could cost up to $20,000.

The New York, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Connecticut Pennsylvania, Maryland and the District of Colombia jurisdictions have all already declared hurricane deductibles invalid.

Individual insurance companies use different ways to decide whether storms are classified as hurricanes or not.

Some use the NWS decision while others decide on an observed wind speed.

The NWS's Hurricane Center says a hurricane is a tropical cyclone or rotating wind system with a minimum sustained surface wind speed of 74mph.

Even though maximum sustained wind speeds with Sandy were at 85mph when the classification changed the storm was downgraded because it had 'lost its tropical characteristics', according to the Hurricane Center.

They labelled it a post-tropical cyclone at 7pm on October 29 - an hour before it hit land.

Last week governors across the US states hit by Sandy said insurance companies should not charge hurricane deductibles.

New York governor Andrew Cuomo said: 'Homeowners should not have to pay hurricane deductibles for damage caused by the storm and insurers should understand the Department of Financial Services will be monitoring how claims are handled.'
