A mother has told of the terrifying moment a woman broke into her home and tried to strangle her young daughter with a television cable.

The intruder barged her way into the home Samantha Adams shares with partner Ryan Cousins and their three children.

She threatened to kidnap Miss Adam's four-year-old son Connor before forcing her way upstairs and seizing Ellie-Mae, nine.

Traumatic: Couple Samantha Adams and Ryan Cousins, and their children Ellie-Mae Cousins, nine, Connor Cousins, four, and Tallulah Cousins, one, are recovering after their horrifying ordeal

The shocked mother-of-three, 26, managed to fend the woman off long enough to drag the children into another room.

As the family barricaded themselves inside, the woman tried to smash the door down.

Describing the ordeal herself, little Ellie-Mae said: 'The woman came in and said, "Hide me, there is a naughty man at the door". Then she got the wire and put it over my head and I was really scared.

''Mummy came up and stopped her and I was screaming.'

Miss Adams said: 'I keep thinking 
about what would have happened if she had managed to get the wire round 
our daughter’s neck - she could have killed her.

'She
burst in, screaming her head off and locked the door behind her. I was 
in the lounge and she ran in, trying to grab my phone.

'Then
she went in the kitchen and grabbed a butter knife - she was shoving it
down her throat trying to make herself sick. She went through periods 
of calm and then started kicking off again.'

The woman, who is thought to have she burst into two houses in Hull, East Yorks, on Friday, apparently shouted: ‘If they don’t give me my son back, I’m going to take yours and kill him’.

Miss Adams' partner Ryan Cousins had left the house just ten minutes earlier, leaving the door unlocked behind him.

Miss Adams said: 'I had just got through to the police and was explaining what happened when she ran upstairs. I put the phone down and went after her - she’d gone into my daughter’s bedroom.

'She pulled the TV wire clean out - the prongs are still in the socket - and had tried to wrap it round Ellie-Mae’s neck. I managed to grab it before she had a chance, but she hit me over the head with the plug.'

'She would be screaming
and yelling one minute and then the next it would be quiet and I could 
hear her doing things in the kitchen. I worried she was looking for a 
big knife.

'At one point she boiled the kettle and brought it upstairs but I managed to get it off her and throw it at her instead.'

Turmoil: Miss Adams' partner Ryan Cousins returned home to find a gaping hole in a door and major damage

Eventually, 20 minutes into the ordeal, Miss Adams managed to get the house phone and make her third attempt to call 999.

This
time, she managed to speak to an operator and explain what was 
happening, but it would be another 20 minutes before police arrived.

She said: 'I’m covered in bruises where she was grabbing me and attacking me through the door.

'But
at one point I did manage to bite her and I also pushed her down the 
stairs. But when I bit her, she didn’t even flinch, it was like she 
didn’t feel it.

'She picked up a table and was smashing it against the door.'

Debris: The family were pinned down in this room while the intruder tried to smash her way inside

When police officers arrived, the woman calmly answered the door and said Miss Adams was the one who was trying to hurt the children.

Officers ran upstairs and realised the children were cuddling close to their mother.

Miss Adams said: 'As soon as they saw me, they knew it wasn’t me. So they went downstairs, but she’d taken all her clothes off and gone out into the street naked.

'They managed to get her back inside in the living room and pin her down to arrest her.'

As police officers were arresting the woman, Miss Adam’s partner Ryan Cousins returned home.

Mr Cousins, 31, said: 'I came home to a war zone - the house was a complete mess. I could have come back to four dead bodies, it could have all gone very differently.

'I’m furious about what has happened - people need to know. The kids are so frightened now and get scared when they go to bed.'

Humberside Police confirmed a 22-year-old woman has been arrested in relation to the incident and enquiries are ongoing.
