A mother whose tirade of racist abuse at fellow passengers on a tram received millions of viewings on YouTube was bound over to keep the peace today.

A judge said that Emma West, 36, was clearly suffering from mental health problems at the time of the outburst on board the tram in Croydon, south London, and had unwittingly overdosed on the medication she took for depression.

Footage of the mother-of-two yelling 'what has this country come to? None of you is f****** English' went viral and was viewed by millions around the world.

West, from Croydon, was also handed a 24-month community order for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against her partner and assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty as she appeared for sentencing at Croydon Crown Court.

The court heard witnesses described West 'reeking of alcohol' when she carried out the verbal attack.

Prosecutor Julius Capon said: 'She in essence persecuted a number of passengers on the tram, subjecting them to some disgusting racial abuse.'

He said the things she said included 'you’re not English', 'none of you are English', 'f*** off' and 'get back to your own countries'.

Mr Capon said many of the passengers were 'upset' by West’s behaviour.

'Some of them described themselves as being disgusted, shocked and horrified,' he said.

But he added that it was not them who complained to police, rather that it came to their attention after a passenger who had filmed it posted it on the internet.

David Martin-Sperry, defending West, said the defendant’s offending was out of character and she does not harbour any racist views.

Mr Martin-Sperry told the court he had heard figures quoted that the footage had received either 11 million or 25 million viewings on YouTube.

The huge amount of publicity the case generated led her to attempt suicide and she had become reclusive due to the abuse she received when she left the house, he said.

It also led her to receive flowers and messages of support from far right supporters. Some have even sent her cheques.

'People gave support to what they thought was a noble cause - they could not be more wrong,' he said.

Mr Martin-Sperry said before the tram incident took place West had admitted herself to an institution attached to the psychiatric Maudsley Hospital in Camberwell, south London.

On the day of the incident, in late 2011, she had again felt 'overheated' and went to see her psychiatrist who increased her dose of citalopram.

After collecting her prescription she took one pill after having already taken one that day and drank a large glass of wine before taking the tram home.

Mr Martin-Sperry said that not only had she taken twice her usual dosage, five days later the maximum limit was reduced from 60mg to 40mg, and so she had in fact taken two and a half times the recommended dose when that was taken into account.

Following a string of adjournments in which her lawyers claimed her mental health problems meant she was not fit to stand trial, West pleaded guilty to a racially aggravated section 5 public order offence in June - 18 months after the rant.

For this offence, West was bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for 12 months, and must not engage in any offensive or disorderly behaviour on public transport.

She pleaded guilty in May this year to attacking her partner of 12 years Ricky Metson with an ornamental knife and assaulting a police officer.

For this offence she was given a community order for 24 months with a supervision requirement for the period under the supervision of a probation officer and a mental health treatment requirement with her current psychiatrist.

Recorder of Croydon Judge Warwick McKinnon said: 'She was a normal, perfectly healthy young woman who held a job for ten years and events took a turn for the worse.

'There were mental health issues, she was committed more than once for treatment.

'After months and months and months of adjournments - not your fault - because the primary concern was your mental health, you did plead guilty and I give you full credit for that.'
