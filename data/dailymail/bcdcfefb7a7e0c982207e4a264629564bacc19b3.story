A party at one of Oxford University's most prestigious colleges was closed down after a student arrived with a homemade flamethrower.

The sight of Inigo Lapwood, 20, firing flames in Christ Church's historic quad prompted officials to stop the college's annual bash where revellers in fancy dress were already downing free alcohol and jelly-wrestling.

They decided he had gone too far with the flamethrower which he had built using a nail gun and glow plug from a diesel engine to ignite a canister of butane gas.

Flaming ridiculous: Inigo Lapwood went too far with a flamethrower he had built using a nail gun and glow plug from a diesel engine to ignite a canister of butane gas

The second year philosophy and psychology student said he was celebrating his return to the university after being sent down for failing to complete his work.

Lapwood claimed: 'I don’t think it was dangerous. I used it for about ten minutes, and it’s not as though I set any of my friends on fire.

'I used it well away from anyone, I never took it inside and I dismantled it after I used it.

'I thought about doing the pun Sex Is On Fire [a reference to the Kings Of Leon song Sex On Fire] but I think that one would definitely be going too far.'

Out of hand: The party is held annually and sponsored by Christ Church College, Oxford, Oxfordshire

The party on Saturday was sponsored by Christ College drinking society the Mercurials, who paid for the open bar.

Police were not called but the party was shut down just after midnight by college porters.

Drunk students left behind a trail of destruction including showers 'full of vomit' and a broken window, student newspaper The Tab reported.

Under the Firearms Act 1968 flamethrowers are classified as a 'prohibited weapon' with the maximum penalty seven years in prison.

Oxford University said today that a student would be disciplined over the incident.

The Very Reverend Christopher Lewis, Dean of Christ Church Oxford, said: 'I understandthere was an incident in the main quad at Christ Church outside the end-of-term party on Saturday.

'The college is investigating and the student concerned will be disciplined.'
