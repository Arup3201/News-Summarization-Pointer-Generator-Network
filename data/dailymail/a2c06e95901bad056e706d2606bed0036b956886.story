Russell Martin is Scotland’s latest defensive concern ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifying opener against Germany on Sunday night.

The Norwich City centre-half was forced to watch Saturday evening’s training at the Signal Iduna Park from the sidelines as he nursed a groin problem.

And he will need to prove his fitness on the morning of the game to take his place at the heart of Gordon Strachan’s defence to face the World Cup winners.

Down to the wire: The Norwich defender will have a late test to prove his fitness in Dortmund

Strachan, whose squad travelled to Dortmund on Saturday without injured defenders Christophe Berra and Andrew Robertson, expressed confidence in Gordon Greer and Grant Hanley teaming up if that is his chosen pairing.

‘Russell felt it on Friday, so we took him out of training as a precaution,’ said Strachan. ‘He will train in the morning and we’ll find out then because we normally name the team right before training.

‘We have been doing alright at centre-half, though. If you look at Gordon Greer since he came in, the results with Gordon and Hanley together have been OK.

‘But we know how we’re going to play, we know the formation. We’ve been doing it for a year and we have tidied up this week so that everyone, no matter what position they play in, knows exactly what’s needed.’

Scotland have kept a clean sheet the last three times Martin has played — against Poland, Norway and Croatia.

Greer and Hanley were in partnership to keep out the United States at Hampden last November, part of a six-match unbeaten streak.

Faith: Strachan believes in his back-up defenders who kept a clean sheet together last year against the USA
