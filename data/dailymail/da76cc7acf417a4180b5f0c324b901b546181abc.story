Christie's did not reveal the buyer of Francis Bacon's three-paneled painting Three Studies Of Lucian Freud, sold for £89 million ($142.4million) on Tuesday.

But one person with the necessary financial clout and love of the artist is Roman Abramovich.

The Russian billionaire and owner of Chelsea football club paid £43 million ($86.3 million) for 'Triptych, 1976' in 2008 - previously the highest amount paid for a Bacon work.

Expensive: Francis Bacon's three-paneled painting Three Studies Of Lucian Freud, pictured, became the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction on Tuesday when it soared to $142.4 million at Christie's

Easel does it: Triptych 1976, by Francis Bacon (1909-1992), which was bought by Roman Abramovich in 2008

Auction: The 1969 triptych, never before offered at auction, carried a pre-sale estimate of about $85 million

A spokesman for Mr Abramovich declined to comment, but there is bound to be speculation that the tycoon is the mystery buyer.

According to The New York Times, the work was sold to Manhattan art dealer William Acquavellam, a specialist in 19th and 20th century art, who bought it for an unnamed client.

The 1969 triptych, never before 
offered at auction and which carried a pre-sale estimate of about $85 
million, easily eclipsed the $119.9 million price of Edvard Munch's The
Scream, achieved in May of last year at Sotheby's.

The art work along with one by Andy Warhol were expected to break records, boosting an already surging market for top-tier works.

Christie's sale on Tuesday was led by Bacon's 1969 triptych.

The jaw-dropping price easily broke the 2008 Bacon record, months before financial markets crashed and sent the art market into a brief decline.

Since then, new, deep-pocketed collectors from around the globe have driven prices to record levels.

At a recent preview, Christie's head of postwar and contemporary art, Brett Gorvy, noted that collectors from Asia, Russia and the Mideast flush with cash were determined to assemble world-class collections featuring trophy works.

Bacon (1909-1992) was born in Dublin to English parents and moved to London in 1926.

Although
he had no formal training as an artist, he started to exhibit his work 
in the 1930s and a decade later his angst-ridden paintings of twisted and 
mutated forms became a sensation in the artistic community. 

He died of a heart attack in Madrid in 1992.

Today, his work is among the most popular of 20th-century art at auction.

In May, Christie's achieved the highest total in the history of auctions when it sold $495 million worth of art at its postwar and contemporary sale.

The auction house said Bacon's three-paneled work, which depicts the Dublin-born painter's friend and fellow artist Lucian Freud on a chair, with a view from each side and one face on, was 'a true masterpiece that marks Bacon and Freud's relationship' and their 'creative and emotional kinship.'

'The juxtaposition of radiant sunshine yellow contrasting with the brutal physicality and immediacy of the brushstrokes in this celebrated life-size triptych is what makes Bacon's art so remarkable,' said Francis Outred, the head of European postwar and contemporary art for Christie's.

'This suddenly becomes a very important conversation between two masters,' Outred said in an interview.

He noted that Three Studies Of Lucian Freud is one of only two existing full-length triptychs of Freud, a grandson of the founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud, and that the three panels were separated for 15 years in the 1970s before being reunited.

Christie's also offering a Warhol Coca-Cola, which carries an estimate of $40 million to $60 million, and a sculpture by Jeff Koons, Balloon Dog (Orange) expected to fetch $35 million to $55 million.

On Wednesday, Sotheby's will try to break the $71.7 million record price for a Warhol when if offers the monumental Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster), which has an estimated sale price of $60 million to $80 million.
