Insistence: Iain Duncan Smith has said the policy of tax breaks for married couples must be implemented and will use his conference speech today to remind the Prime Minister

Tax breaks for married couples must be implemented before the next election as David Cameron promised, Iain Duncan Smith will insist today. 

The Work and Pensions Secretary will use his conference speech to remind the Prime Minister about the policy, which MPs fear has slipped down the agenda thanks to the power-sharing deal with the Lib Dems.

Mr Duncan Smith, the leading Cabinet champion of the policy, will also insist the Government must do more to reverse the bias against couples in the tax and benefit system.

And he will signal new sanctions for benefit claimants who refuse to take jobs, promising a new ‘contract’ which will ‘bring to an end the something-for-nothing culture’.

‘Fail to seek work, take work, stay in work or co-operate, and you will lose your benefits,’ he will say.

A poll for the think tank Mr Duncan Smith set up in opposition has identified overwhelming support for a recognition in the tax system for marriage.

The YouGov survey for the Centre for Social Justice found two-thirds of voters  support the idea, suggesting it enjoys support well beyond those who have tied the knot.

The CSJ today publishes a ‘manifesto for the family’, which is designed as a wake-up call to the Government on the issue of family breakdown and the need for tangible support for marriage.

It calls for ministers to speak up more clearly in support of the institution of marriage, remove the penalty against couples in the benefits system, and reject plans to make divorce easier.

Clear pledge: David Cameron has previously said that he will recognise marriage in the tax system and do so before the end of this Parliament

Mr Duncan Smith will tell the conference that the role of the family is ‘one of the most important issues for our country’.

‘This isn’t about government interfering in family life; it’s about government recognising that stable two-parent families are vital for the creation of a strong society,’ he will say. ‘It’s about parents taking responsibility for their children. It is about government realising that we have to create a level playing field for the decisions people make about family. 

‘This means reversing the biases against stability we’ve seen in recent years, including the damaging financial discouragement to couple formation, despite the evidence of its stable outcomes for children.

‘We also need to make sure that support is available when families most need it. That’s why I intend for our welfare reforms to make an impact on the couple penalty where it matters most – amongst families on the lowest incomes.

‘Furthermore, the Prime Minister has made it clear that in this Parliament the Government will recognise marriage in the tax system.’

Right signal: Gavin Poole said that the introduction of a tax break would show society that marriage is a stabilising factor and contributes to the welfare of both adults and children

Before the election, the Tories proposed a transferable allowance which would apply to all married couples – and gay couples in civil partnerships – who pay the basic rate of income tax.

Spouses not using all of their tax-free personal allowance – either because they stay at home or work part-time and earn less than £6,600 – were to be able to transfer £750 of their benefit to their working partner.

Eligible couples where one partner is not using all the tax-free personal allowance and the other earns between £6,600 and £44,000 would be up to £150 a year better off.

But the issue went on the back burner in coalition talks with the Lib Dems, who fiercely oppose special recognition for marriage.

Mr Cameron has said since the election that he intends to honour the pledge before 2015, but Chancellor George Osborne suggested last week there would be no room for tax cuts before the election.

As well as identifying strong support for marriage tax breaks, the poll for the CSJ found that, in the wake of the summer riots, more than 80 per cent say they regard family breakdown as a ‘serious’ problem facing society.

Gavin Poole, CSJ executive director, said: ‘Restoring a tax break for marriage would provide help to families and send a signal right through society that marriage is a stabilising factor and contributes to the welfare of adults and children alike.’

She may once have been dubbed the Tory Party’s ‘secret weapon’, but Samantha Cameron is not known for her deep interest in politics.

And yesterday she underlined the point by making a discreet exit from the Conservative Party conference three hours before it had even started.

Mrs Cameron travelled to Manchester on Saturday and accompanied her husband while he did a round of television interviews yesterday morning.

She posed for pictures with him outside the conference hotel, in a £220 beige Nicole Farhi jacket teamed with a black £15.99 top from the high street store Zara and black cropped trousers from Joseph costing £165.

But minutes later she was packing her bags and heading back to London to look after the couple’s children.

On her arrival in Manchester, she wore £39.99 orange trousers and a £19.99 grey top both from Zara.

Today, while her husband puts the finishing touches to his speech, she is expected at work at the upmarket stationery firm Smythson where she is a part-time consultant.

Sources suggested she would return on Tuesday, on the eve of the Prime Minister’s speech to conference.

She was not the only political wife to bow out of Manchester yesterday – William Hague’s wife Ffion  departed shortly after the Foreign Secretary addressed the conference.
