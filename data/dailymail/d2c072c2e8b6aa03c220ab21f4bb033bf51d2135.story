Two Seattle Seahawks mega-stars are flacking for Obamacare, but they won't need government-brokered medical insurance themselves – the NFL already provides one of America's best plans to its millionaire players, free of charge.

Quarterback Russell Simmons and cornerback Richard Sherman appear in a Department of Health and Human Services video released online on Friday, urging Americans to visit HealthCare.gov and shop for coverage before the February 15 open-enrollment deadline. 

NFL players get medical, dental and life insurance. The medical coverage has a contract-mandated maximum $800 annual deductible for families, and $400 for individuals.

That out-of-pocket cost pales in comparison to some Obamacare plans.

CBS News reported in December 2013 that some 'bronze'-level plans offered at Healthcare.gov saddle policyholders with deductibles as high as $12,700.

EAT UP AND STAY HEALTHY: On November 27 Wilson and Sherman celebrated a win over their arch-rivals, the San Francisco 49ers, by carrying a Thanksgiving turkey to the Seattle locker room.

A deductible is the cost of medical care that an insurance customer must pay for on his or her own each year before coverage kicks in and the company will pay a claim.

Deductibles that are too high discourage people from seeking care.

The NFL's policy also offers a benefit cap of $2.5 million, according to the DelDuca Sports agency, which represents players.

'When your health or the game is on the line, nothing is more important than quality coverage,' Sherman says in the video.

Sherman's job is to 'cover' offensive wide receivers and deny them the chance to make leaping catches.

Wilson tells fans to 'make the right call ... and get covered.'

The National Football League's union-negotiated insurance coverage is included without cost to players in every contract, even though many of them have nine-figure, multi-year contracts and the league's minimum salary is $420,000 for active players.

Even lowly 'practice squad' grunts are guaranteed at least $102,000, more than enough to pay for health insurance.

The Obama administration has set $94,200 as the maximum salary for a family of four who want to receive a government subsidy to help with health insurance costs. 

Sherman has a four-year $56 million contract, while Wilson earns a paltry $2.4 million but is expected to sign a $100 million deal in the off-season, making him one of pro sports' most highly compensated stars.

HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement that she was grateful to the players 'for volunteering their time to raise awareness about the importance of enrolling in health insurance coverage.'

SCRAMBLING: Wilson's Seahawks crushed the Arizona Cardinals in Phoenix on December 21 by a 35-6 score

DENIED: Sherman defended this pass while 'covering' 49ers wide receiver Brandon Lloydin the first quarter of a Thanksgiving Day game.

Her press release boasts that the once bug-plagued Healthcare.gov website now features 'a new streamlined application [that] reduces the number of screens to 16 with fewer clicks to navigate through the questions.'

'Last year, consumers went through 76 screens to sign up for coverage,' HHS said.

Burwell's video includes one cringe-inducing moment that will remind critics of some athletes' reputation for being light on book-learning.

Playing up the 'coverage' pun, Wilson tells a grinning Sherman that ‘All I know is their receivers are going to be covered on Sundays.'

The English subtitle – turned on by default in the YouTube video – reads: ‘All I know is they're [sic] receivers are going to covered on Sundays.'

HHS corrected its garbled closed-caption (CC) English after DailyMail.com pointed it out.

A spokesperson told DailyMail.com that the agency is 'excited that Russell Wilson and Richard Sherman are encouraging Americans to visit HealthCare.gov and sign up for health insurance coverage through the Marketplace.'

'CC has been updated,' the spokesperson added, with another NFL pun. 'Thanks for the flag.'
