A woman who went to her GP about a sore throat was horrified to learn she also had kidney failure.

Paula Rowlett, 32, went to her doctor and
 was diagnosed with a throat infection. But tests also revealed her blood 
pressure was sky-high because of the kidney problems.

The college lecturer, St Helens, Merseyside, needed dialysis four times a day and was told a donor was desperately needed if she was to live a normal life.

When her cousin Lynley Everest, 40, heard about her predicament, she flew more than 10,000 miles from Sydney, Australia, to donate one of her kidneys.

The operation took place at the Royal Liverpool Hospital on July 21.

Ms Rowe said: 'Doctors couldn’t confirm what caused the kidney failure but it was high blood pressure that caused the damage - they just couldn’t repair themselves.

'It was a huge shock for me because I consider myself fit and healthy - I used to go boxing three times a week.'

Ms Rowe had only met her cousin for the first time in 2007, when Ms Everest's mother - who had moved from Liverpool to Australia aged 18 - passed away.

They kept in touch on social media sites and upon hearing of her cousin's ill health, Ms Everst travelled to the UK last year to try and help.

'She knew she was the same blood group as me and that’s why she wanted to be put forward,' MsRowlett said.

Upon arriving last November, Ms Everest, a sales and financial manager, underwent a series of scans - which thankfully revealed her kidney was a suitable match.

She said: 'Once I found out Paula was unwell, I did the research.

'A lot of people have asked me "when did you decide?’". But it didn’t ever occur to me not to do this.

'Paula is an incredibly positive person. What a lot of people would moan about, she doesn’t - it’s just her character.'

Despite Ms Everest not being able to board a plane for six weeks after the operation, she maintains it was worth it.

Jean Shallcross, who completed the transplant, said: 'We agreed with the donor a date she would be able to come as she needs to stay here for six weeks in case of post-operative complications.

'She came the week before the operation and an independent assessor did the Human Tissue Authority test.

'This ensures people have not been coerced or paid to supply an organ.

'She also had a compatibility test and met the surgeon before going into theatre.'
