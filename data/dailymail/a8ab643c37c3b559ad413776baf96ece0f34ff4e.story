A man who stole a truck full of 7,500 pairs of yet-to-be-released Nike Lebron 12s from a Tennessee factory has been arrested - and all but 700 pairs of the shoes were recovered.

Charles Jennings, 35, an employee of cargo transportation company Intermodal Cartage Group, used his employee ID card to scan into a secure lot at the Memphis facility in November.

Once inside he got in a truck that was full of the specialty sneakers - worth up to $1.5 million - and drove away, according to Breitbart News.

Memphis is a major distribution hub for both Nike and FedEx, putting the FBI and US Marshalls on the case.

Arrested: Charles Jennings, 35, an employee of cargo transportation company Intermodal Cartage Group in Memphis, allegedly stole a truck full of 7,500  new Lebron 12 Nike shoes, worth an estimated $1.5 million

Police allege Jennings spent a week selling the shoes to different retailers.

However they were able to track down the truck was arrest him on November 14.

He has been charged with theft of property worth $600,000 or more.

It is believed he made $623,000 from the 700 pairs of trainers that were missing from the truck, ESPN reported.

That would mean selling them for about $83 each.

Stores would then mark up the price to about $200.

It is unclear whether any penalties will be imposed on the stores that did buy from Jennings.

Lebron: It is believed Jennings made $623,000 from 700 pairs of trainers he sold from the 7,500 that were in  truck, worth a rough total of $1.5 million

He was released from jail on a $75,000 bond.

'He had a pretty good idea what he had,' Dunbar told ESPN.

'They were Nikes and they were more valuable in that they hadn't been released yet.'

Jennings is due to appear in court next on December 30.
