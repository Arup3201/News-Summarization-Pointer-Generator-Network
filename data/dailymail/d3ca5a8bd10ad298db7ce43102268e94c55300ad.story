The commute home for millions of New Yorkers has been a slow, protracted process, with many stuck in one of the outer boroughs, unable to find a way out.

More subway and rail lines started operating again Friday, and the Holland Tunnel into New York was open to buses.

But that did little to assuage the massive transit nightmare that has been the past week, as Superstorm Sandy shut down subways, buses, and commuter rail; those braving the mass transit system were today forced to over-crowd into buses and crawling trains.

Commuters formed long lines along Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street as New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) resumed only a bus service throughout New York but no subway service

The MTA re-opened parts of two lines, the M and 7 trains, which go from Queens into Manhattan. In addition, limited Amtrak service resumed.

Subway service was again free today, though there was still no service below 34th Street.

In addition, Long Island Railroad trains were running very limited hourly service on four lines, including the Port Jefferson branch, Ronkonkoma branch, and Babylon branch.

The roads and byways of New York were eerily empty as fuel reserves dwindled, though some two million barrels are expected to be distributed to gas stations around the tri-state area as quickly as possible.

Commuters were also seen forming long lines along Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street as they waited for buses

Though the MTA did not charge bus fare, without the subway service, commuters found packed buses and long lines and delays along their commutes

Yellow cabs were few and far between as they ran out of petrol and were forced to curb their cars.

In lieu of subways, buses ran along the subway lines, in addition to those running their routes.

As with yesterday, massive queues formed around hubs like Brooklyn’s Barclay’s Center and Manhattan’s Grand Central.

Despite the crowds, New Yorkers seemed uncharacteristically good-natured as they rode buses taken them from the darkness of downtown.

The MTA has no exact timeline for restoring service.
