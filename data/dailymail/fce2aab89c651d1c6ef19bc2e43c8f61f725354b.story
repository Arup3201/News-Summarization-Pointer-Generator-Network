A pair of Buddhist monks have been arrested for smoking crystal meth with two women in their sacred pagoda in Siem Reap, Cambodia.

Police raided the room of 36-year-old Pich David, who has a history of breaking the rules, and found alcohol, condoms and a crack pipe.

Buddhist monks are forbidden from taking drugs, drinking and having sex.

Chan Bunna, a 19-year-old monk, was also arrested, along with two male residents of the pagoda and two female market vendors, all for drug use, while the supplier was also arrested.

The police raid was triggered by months of complaints from neighbours about the monks having loud parties late at night. 

It happened while Cambodia was celebrating the festival of the dead - Pchum Ben - a particularly holy time in the country.

When they were tested for methamphetamine, just Bunna and one of the women were found positive.

David was also charged with violently resisting police officers. 

Slakram commune police chief Khiev Sort told the Cambodia Daily that David, of Pur Langka, has long been watched under suspicions he had been going against the Buddhist doctrine in the past.

He was kicked out of the pagoda - a towered, religious building common in much of Asia - for poor behaviour in 2012, but readmitted the following year after promising to respect and follow the rules. 

The two monks have been defrocked, the chief monk of the pagoda, Keo Khouy, confirmed.
