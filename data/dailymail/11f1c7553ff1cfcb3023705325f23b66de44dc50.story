A 19-year-old backpacker from China has sparked outrage by offering to have sex with a different man in every city she visits to fund her travels. 

Student Ju Peng, from the eastern city of Shanghai, had posted an online ad looking for 'temporary boyfriends' who must be 'good looking, under 30, taller than 1.75 metres and, of course, rich'.

Ju says: 'They will fund my transport to their city and all my expenses while I am there and they need to be generous.'

'Of course, rich': Student Ju Peng, from the eastern city of Shanghai, had posted an online ad looking for 'temporary boyfriends' who must be 'good looking, under 30, taller than 1.75 metres and, of course, rich'

'Beautiful girl': She says each man will fund her transport and expenses and 'be generous' and in return will have the 'chance to show off in company of truly beautiful girl'

She adds: 'In return, they get a whole night with me, my undivided attention, and a chance to show themselves off in the company of a truly beautiful girl.'

Ju says she has already travelled all over eastern China this way and wants to see the rest of the country but does not have enough money to fund it herself.

Like hitchhiking? Ju says she already travelled all over eastern China this way and wants to see the rest of the country but does not have enough money to fund it herself, adding, 'It is sort of like hitch-hiking. It's nothing to be ashamed of'

She said: 'It is sort of like hitch-hiking. It's nothing to be ashamed of.'

But critics say the deal is nothing but prostitution and have called for the ad to be taken down.

One Weibo user Hsin Tao said: 'If she was taking cash we'd all know what to call her. This is a disgusting way to carry on.'
