Host commentator

It's all over and it ends 4-1 after an impressive home performance from Everton. An own goal from Rodriguez gave the Toffees an early lead before Coleman and Baines scored either side of the break to put Martinez's side into a commanding lead.

Mirallas added the icing on the cake with a fourth before a stunning consolation free-kick from Rodriguez.

And he has been beaten! There was nothing Howard could do about a stunning free-kick from Rodriguez which grazes the post before flying in. Howard looks a bit annoyed, but the final whistle goes and it ends 4-1!

92mins: Wolfsburg respond with two corners in quick succession before winning a promising free-kick on the edge of Everton's box. 

Howard has played so well tonight, he won't want to be beaten by this...

It's another! And Mirallas is the man to put the Toffees into a 4-0 lead with just minutes to go.

The Belgian beats the offside trap after a lovely through ball from Eto'o and slots past Benaglio with ease. Coleman is replaced by Osman. 

85mins: Rodriguez crosses well once again but Jagielka is there to clear. At the other end, Baines bombs down the left before crossing for Eto'o. The former Barcelona man can't get near the ball though as Benaglio collects.

81mins: Naismith is replaced by Gibson

80mins: Just 10 minutes plus stoppage time left at Goodison as Everton try and play keep ball before McGeady races down the right and crossed for Eto'o. The cross is cut out though as Wolfsburg are on the attack again. 

74mins: De Bruyne forces a brilliant save from Howard after the winger put Coleman on his backside with a drop of the shoulder. Howard has been in fine form this evening. 

70mins: Mirallas is shown a yellow card for kicking the ball away after a foul on the left hand side.

Everton are struggling to keep the ball at the moment as Wolfsburg search for a consolation.

McGeady curls just wide after a stunning ball from Eto'o to find Naismith who laid the ball off for the winger.

Lukaku is replaced by Samuel Eto'o in the 68th minute. He scored his first goal for Everton just six minutes into his debut against former club Chelsea. Can he had to that tally this evening? Just over 20 minutes to go. 

Joe Bernstein: David Moyes, the last Everton manager to take them into Europe, can take some reflected glory on this result.

He signed the entire Everton back-five including the excellent Seamus Coleman and Leighton Baines

63mins: It's been one way traffic since Everton have gone 3-0 up as Wolfsburg try and make a show of things. Martinez's side have coped well though and don't look likely to concede as it stands. 

Here he comes - Former Arsenal striker and serial maverick Bendtner replaces Caligiuri on the hour mark. What can he do? 

55mins: Naismith picks up a needless yellow card for a late tackle on the edge of Everton's box.

Rodriguez fires a stunning strike towards goal from the set piece, but Howard stretches out his right arm to pull off a brilliant save. 

Dominic King: With this game now won, Roberto Martinez has the chance to make changes and it is surely only a matter of time before Darron Gibson is given a runout.

He went through an extensive warm-up during half-time and his first action since rupturing his cruciate ligament last September beckons. Expect a big fanfare when he does arrive.

Was it ever in doubt? Baines sends Benaglio the wrong way and puts Everton into a 3-0 lead. It was a controversial penalty decision though as McGeady seemed to be fouled OUTSIDE of the penalty area. Everton fans won't care though - it's 3-0! 

A fantastic half for Everton as the take a two-goal lead into the break thanks to a Rodgriguez own goal and a Coleman header.

The two teams have looked fairly even, but the home side have taken their two chances brilliantly while Wolfsburg have failed to truly test Howard. 

What a time to score! Brilliant play from Mirallas and Lukaku ends up with a Coleman diving header at the far post.

Lukaku won the header, Mirallas caused panic in the Wolfsburg box before knocking the ball to Baines who crossed for Coleman to head into an empty net. 2-0!

40mins: Lukaku does well to win a header before winning a free-kick after a neat one-two with Mirallas. 

From the resulting set-piece, Lukaku sends Benaglio scrambling to his left before saving.  

36mins: The two teams trade possession before Wolfsburg attack through Olic. The bearded Howard leaps out of his goal to claim yet another cross. 

Elliott Bretland: Goodison roared as Everton returned to European competition for the first time in five years and bellowed as the Toffees took the lead.

However, it has to be said, the teams on the field haven't really done too much to get fans excited inbetween or since...

29mins: Rodriguez fires a brilliant ball in from the left which was flying towards Olic before Tim Howard runs out to claim. Fascinating game at Goodison so far, Everton may be wondering just how they are ahead... 

23mins: Wolfsburg look shell-shocked as Everton attack once again through Lukaku before the big Belgian is flagged offside.

At the other end, McCarthy blocks well from Olic.  

Dominic King: There was a break in play after Steven Naismith’s goal as Diego Benaglio, Wolfsburg keeper, has gone to replace his contact lens. He was shown on TV explaining to the match officials that he had lost it.

A word on Naismith: he initially found things difficult on Merseyside and admitted to being in awe of his team-mates after arriving from Glasgow Rangers. But he has really found his stride in the last 12 months and is arguably Everton’s most improved player.

Joe Bernstein: Can Everton succeed where Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City have failed this week - and beat German opposition? You better believe it!

It's that man again! Naismith pokes the ball towards after a brilliant piece of passing from McCarthy and Baines. Benaglio was the unlucky party, though, as the ball rebounded off the goalkeepr before going in.

It was Everton's first real attack of the game after keeping Wolfsburg at bay for the early stages.  

13mins: Lukaku sprints towards a long ball and manages to force a corner for the Toffees. The set-piece is cleared by Naldo, but it doesn't stop the Everton attack.

Baines picks up the ball from the left before deciding to play safe.

10mins: De Bruyne blazes over after neat build-up play from Olic. Roberto Martinez's side are being far too respectful of Wolfsburg so far. 

7mins: Malanda races down the left before being tackled by Barry. From the resulting corner, Rodriguez fluffs his lines after the ball drops kindly to him. Chance missed for the away side.

Everton need to sharpen up here. 

Elliott Bretland: It seems Bryan Oviedo, close to a return to first-team action, has turned up late as stewards frantically attempt to get him seated.

Had the Costa Rican turned up late for Everton's last home game against Chelsea he'd have missed the away side's opening two goals!

3mins: Early chance for the away side as former Chelsea winger De Bruyne races through the middle releasing Olic. The Croatian fires towards goal before being flagged offside. 

On a historic day for Scotland, what price Steven Naismith to be the first goalscorer at Goodison. He'll start in the middle of a three supporting Romelu Lukaku.

We're underway at Goodison park with Everton in blue and Wolfsburg in white. Can the Toffees get off to a winning start tonight? Find out here...

Man City striker Edin Dzeko cheering on former club Wolfsburg at Goodison Park in the Europa League this evening. 

Everton's opponents Wolfsburg will be hoping for a better night than two of their 2009 title-winning alumni. Their victorious manager Felix Magath has been sacked by Fulham and star striker Edin Dzeko is nursing a Champions League defeat for Man City.

Looks a right laugh in the away end tonight...
