 

The FA are in the process of renewing a contract with bookmakers William Hill despite the considerable conflict of interest because of the blanket ban on gambling for anyone working in English football.

William Hill were controversial £2.5million-a-year sponsors of England and the FA Cup when the deal was first signed in 2012 because of the regulations against footballers betting which have now been extended to worldwide restrictions on the whole football family.

Yet the FA, who rule on gambling breaches, still intend to keep an official betting partner, with William Hill close to agreeing a new four-year deal for the next World Cup cycle.

However, the deal will be considerably less — around £1.5m annually — because the FA are in a weak negotiating position after such a woeful World Cup performance and players’ appearances being taken out of the rights because of the gambling implications.

William Hill are also having to save significant amounts because of a new law which obliges them — along with other betting companies — to pay UK tax on their off-shore earnings which will cost them around £70m a year.

The FA say a close relationship with a bookmaker helps them monitor illegal betting. But the new agreement has still to be rubber-stamped by the FA and William Hill boards.

The upheaval at Crystal Palace includes ambitious chief scout Tim Coe leaving Selhurst Park to join Championship club Brighton, who have revamped their recruitment operation. 

It is understood Coe was looking for more day-to-day involvement than he was given under Tony Pulis. Coe, 28, was the youngest chief scout in the Premier League last season and combined those duties with qualifying to be a solicitor.

There is plenty of surprise within talkSPORT that lead football analyst Stan Collymore has been granted extended leave since the World Cup — missing the start of the season and is not due back until August 30.

Collymore was said to be exhausted after his stint in Brazil, but has since had Twitter rows with Gary Neville and his talkSPORT colleague Alan Brazil. 

And, far from resting, Collymore is actually in Miami working for BeIN Sport.

In the unlikely event of Duncan Fletcher surviving as India head coach after the dismal way his team capitulated against England, he certainly won’t be able to name his own lucrative terms again. 

These included being excused all media duties other than one pre-series press conference that took place at Leicester. 

However, the taciturn Fletcher has still managed to demonstrate with his actions this summer — notably during the Lord’s Test won by India — how bitter he still remains at being sacked as England coach after the Ashes and World Cup demise in 2005-06.

Fergie double booking

Publishers Hodder & Stoughton, who mounted a military-style security operation around the launch of Sir Alex Ferguson’s autobiography last October, were unaware on Tuesday that the unveiling of the paperback edition, with two added chapters, 12 months on will clash with another book trading off Fergie’s name.

Aurum Press are bringing out How to Think Like Sir Alex Ferguson: the business of winning and managing success, by sports psychologist Professor Damian Hughes, who says he is drawing on his ‘first-hand experiences of working with Ferguson’.

British Basketball are desperate for Minister for Sport Helen Grant to speak out about their being starved of funding by UK Sport’s zero tolerance towards those without Olympic medal potential. And time is running out for the British women’s team, who could still qualify for Rio 2016. 

Performance chief Roger Moreland requested a meeting with Grant in June and was told October was the earliest she could see him. A DCMS spokesman said that timescale was not unusual with party conferences following the summer recess.
