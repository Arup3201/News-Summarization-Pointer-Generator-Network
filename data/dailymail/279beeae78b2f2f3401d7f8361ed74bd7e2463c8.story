On the same day a Spanish newspaper reported Real Madrid were keeping their number nine shirt free for Radamel Falcao, the Colombian’s club Monaco have insisted the striker is not for sale.

At the unveiling of new boss Leonardo Jardim on Thursday, Monaco’s vice-president Vadim Vasilyev addressed the rumours surrounding the future of Falcao, as well as Colombia's World Cup star James Rodriguez.

‘There are currently no discussions or negotiations with any club about Falcao,’ Vasilyev told reporters.

‘We rely on Falcao and we think he will have a great season in 2014-15 with Monaco.’

A serious knee injury in January stopped Falcao from joining up with Colombia’s World Cup squad in Brazil, but Jose Pekerman’s side are doing just fine without him, thanks to the emergence at international level of Monaco team-mate James Rodriguez.

The 22-year-old has scored in all four of Colombia’s matches and leads the race for the Golden Boot with five goals, one ahead of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Thomas Muller.

Rodriguez signed for Monaco from Porto for £36million last year and has been the star of a glittering tournament so far.

‘About James Rodriguez, everyone was surprised that we paid such a large sum a year ago. Now everyone is talking about him, which proves we were right.

‘We strongly believe in this player - he is very important to us. We trust Rodriguez and Falcao will continue to do great things for us next season.’
