Eight hunters that were adrift on an ice floe in Nanavut for two days have now been rescued by the Canadian Air Force.

The group of men were cast adrift on Friday when a large mass of ice broke off and drifted away from Coral Harbour. 

A local search effort was halted after the floe drifted beyond the community's reach.

On Saturday the Royal Canadian Air Force sent a CC-130 Hercules plane from Winnipeg, Manitoba, to drop off radios, survival equipment, drinking water and food rations.

Job well done: The RCAF praised the preparedness of the men, who were well-dressed and equipped

'It wasn't life and death yet,' RCAF Maj. Steve Neta told Yahoo News.

'It was large and looked like a massive expanse of snow. 

'The conditions up there can change so quickly. 

'Just with the change in wind and ocean currents, it can break up into something smaller.'

Temperatures in the area dropped below minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit.

By Sunday the situation had worsened and the men needed to be pulled out.

A CH-149 Cormorant helicopter flew in from Greenwood, Nova Scotia, and hoisted the hunters from the floe.

At the time the floe was about 55 Km south of Coral Harbour and about 27 Km from the nearest shoreline.

The rescue was completed on January 11 with all men being airlifted to Coral Harbour

The men were flow back to Coral Harbour.

Neta praised them for their preparedness, especially having a beacon that could transmit their position.

'They were well-clothed and well-equipped,' he said. 

'Their preparedness made a huge difference in our ability to do this well.'

Maj. Vince Meunier agreed.

'This case shows how preparedness greatly increases the chance for survival,' he said.
