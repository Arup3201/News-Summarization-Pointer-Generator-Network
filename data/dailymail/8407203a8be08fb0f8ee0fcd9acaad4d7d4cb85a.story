Arrested 19 times: Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, had an extensive rap sheet in multiple states, documents reveal

The murderer who assassinated two NYPD officers threatened to shoot a pair of Con ed workers, who tried to tackle him - raising his gun and shouting: 'You want some of this?'

The unnamed men had been working in Bedford-Stuyvesant - close to where Ismaaiyl Brinsley gunned down officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos at around 3pm on Saturday.

The shocked workers witnessed the depraved killer ambush and open fire into the passenger's side of the police car and decided to follow him in their Con Ed truck as he fled the scene.

Despite Brinsley still holding his silver Taurus semi-automatic - the brave men confronted him on the street and attempted to stop him, the New York Post reports.

They only backed away when Brinsley raised his gun and threatened to shoot them - and they watched as he ran into the Myrtle/Willoughby G train subway station nearby.

The Con Ed workers were able to tip off police as to Brinsley's whereabouts and have been commended for their efforts.

One law enforcement source told the New York Post: 'That’s how the cops knew he was in there.' 

When police pursuing Brinsley ran into the subway station, the killer, who had been standing on the platform waiting for a train, turned the gun on himself.

Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, is said to have asked passers-by to follow him on Instagram saying to some 'watch what I'm going to do' before killing the two men.

The 28-year-old had earlier posted to the social network boasting that he would take the lives of two policemen.

Brave: The Con Ed employees jumped out their truck (like the one pictured) and tried to tackle Brinsley - but he raised his gun and threatened to shoot them, forcing them to back away

He wrote:  'I'm Putting Wings On Pigs Today. 

'They Take 1 Of Ours... Let's Take 2 of Theirs #ShootThePolice #RIPErivGardner (sic) #RIPMikeBrown.

'This May Be My Final Post. I'm Putting Pigs In A Blanket.' 

Just hours later, he walked up behind the patrol car of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, parked up in Brooklyn, then fired four bullets at their heads, 'execution style'.

It has since emerged Brinsley had already been arrested 19 times for offenses including concealing a weapon, disorderly conduct, and trespassing.

'Funny and intelligent'? A close friend of killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, described him as a nice guy and said he was cowardly for lashing out at officers

Charges: He was detained for, among other things, disorderly conduct, theft, and concealing weapons

Before: This picture and chilling message was posted on the alleged shooter's page two hours beforehand

He had also threatened to hang himself, and had been disowned by his mother and two sisters for being violent and aggressive.

Speaking at a press conference yesterday, NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce revealed a timeline which began with the shooting of an ex-girlfriend near Baltimore, and ended with Ismaaiyl's suicide on a subway platform.

Describing the final moments, caught on surveillance cameras, he said: 'We have found on one of our videos two males who spoke with the perpetrator just prior to the event.

Tributes: Dozens of flowers were left on the sidewalk near the site of the killing yesterday

Tributes: NYPD badges were seen strewn among the mementos, including Christmas wreaths and holly

'He asks them three things: For their gang affiliation, he asks them to follow him on Instagram, then he says "watch what I'm going to do".

'He then walks north down on Tompkins, past the two officers in the car, circles back around, goes across the street, then comes up behind the officers.'

Boyce added: 'His mother ... states he had a very troubled childhood and was often violent. His mother expressed fear of him and she hasn't seen him in one month.

'Brinsley attempted suicide in the past and attempted to hang himself a year ago.'

He has  served jail time in Georgia and Ohio and it has also emerged today that has admitted to suffering mental health problems in the past.

During a court hearing in Georgia's Cobb County in 2011, Brinsley was asked whether he had been in an institution or undergone treatment by mental health professionals, according to the New York Times.

He answered yes.
