Marouane Fellaini has endured a lot since swapping Merseyside for Manchester. Derided as a symbol of the David Moyes regime, ridiculed by his own fans and, lately, held responsible for Louis van Gaal’s occasional lurch towards route-one football, the big Belgian has had more weighing on his shoulders than that trademark mass of curly hair.

So the standing ovation he received from the majority of Manchester United supporters when he came off against Tottenham at Old Trafford last weekend will have been music to his ears.

A well-taken opening goal with his left foot served as a reminder that Fellaini’s attributes are not just sandwiched between his chest and his head.

There are those who will never accept that he is a true United player, who believe his very presence encourages United to play other than the United way.

But as he prepares to make his first appearance on Merseyside since moving from Everton when Van Gaal’s side take on Liverpool on Sunday, the 6ft 4in midfielder has every right to feel that things are looking up. 

The £27.5million white elephant of Old Trafford has been reinvented as United’s not-so-secret weapon.

The advanced role that Van Gaal has given to Fellaini led Sam Allardyce, of all people, to label his opponents ‘Long Ball United’ after the 27-year-old’s introduction off the bench helped salvage a 1-1 draw at West Ham last month.

Fellaini was tainted, somewhat unfairly, by being the only signing made during David Moyes' summer in charge

Van Gaal doesn’t care. ‘Fellaini is a player that, when we cannot beat the pressure with quality, we can always beat with pressure — that is a quality,’ says the Dutchman.

The transition from defensive midfielder, who first impressed Moyes playing for Standard Liege against Liverpool in the Champions League in 2008, to target man worked particularly well for Everton.

But, unlike Van Gaal, Moyes did not feel comfortable deploying Fellaini in a similar role at Old Trafford, having drawn enough criticism merely for signing him when Cesc Fabregas was his priority in the summer of 2013.

Disastrously, Fellaini ended up as United’s only signing and Moyes knew that he risked being accused of turning the Premier League champions into a poor imitation of Everton.

The player was said to be ecstatic at signing for United, if a little overawed at the scale of the club. He struck up an immediate bond with fellow Belgian Adnan Januzaj and, later, Juan Mata, when the Spaniard joined the following January.

By then it had all started to go wrong, a combination of injuries and sub-standard performances in a more defensive position confirming the fears of many United supporters. Last April, the now-defunct fanzine Red Issue mocked up an advert of his afro hair as a toilet brush with the slogan: ‘Flush a fortune down the pan’.

Since the arrival of Van Gaal, the midfielder has been used as an outlet and a way of breaking teams down

Fellaini was said to be devastated by it all, and even more so when Moyes was sacked later that month. He felt isolated and has since claimed that he was made a scapegoat for the club’s decline.

One thing that never waned, however, was Fellaini’s determination to salvage his dream. When he returned from the World Cup last summer he held talks with Van Gaal, who reassured him that he would not be sold despite talk of a move to Napoli.

The message had not reached United fans, some of whom sarcastically applauded Fellaini’s every touch in Van Gaal’s first home game against Valencia right up until the moment he scored a last-minute winner. Even then, it was assumed that his first goal for United would be his last.

Five more have followed this season. Fellaini came off the bench at half-time to turn the game at West Brom in October and again at QPR in January. In between, he started in six successive wins before Christmas, ending with a comprehensive 3-0 win over Liverpool when he destroyed his old Merseyside rivals.

Now Fellaini is set to face them again on Sunday having won over at least some of his critics, much to the admiration of Phil Neville, his former Everton team-mate and United’s first-team coach under Moyes.

‘Last season Fellaini was getting ridiculed and the way he has come back from that has been fantastic,’ said Neville.

‘He’s won people over by being brave about the stick he was getting and never going missing in games, even when things were not working for him.

‘You also have to give Louis van Gaal credit. He has not been afraid of playing to Fellaini’s strengths despite being criticised for doing so. I think he has come up trumps.’
