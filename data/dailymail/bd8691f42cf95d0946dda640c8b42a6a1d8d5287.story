Wonky, the bandy-legged puppy who won the nation's affections after being abandoned, has found a family to call her own.

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross was rescued by staff at Dogs Trust Leeds last month and walked on her wrists because her front legs had not formed properly.

But after care and attention from staff at the charity, physiotherapy helped to straighten out her legs.

Now Wonky, now known as Hope, has been adopted by professional dog walker Kimberley Beaton and was pictured yesterday enjoying a run near the family home in Bradford.

Wonky, renamed Hope, has found a new home with Kimberley Beaton and her family in Bradford

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross puppy cut a pitiful figure when she was abandoned with malformed front legs. But now, after physiotherapy, she has new owners and a new leash of life

Miss Beaton, 21, said: 'We've renamed
her Hope because the staff at the Dogs Trust didn't give up on her and 
helped her recovery.'

About 600 people applied to the charity to offer the puppy a new home.

Miss Beaton said: 'I was gobsmacked when we heard we had got her as I knew there would be hundreds of applicants for her.

'We filled out a form anyway, and now here she is. We are over the moon.

Hope now
shares the family home with Miss Beaton, her parents Helen, 50, and 
Harry, 53, and 18-year-old sister Emily, as well as three-year-old 
chocolate labrador Dayna, three guinea pigs, two tortoises and two fish.

It is the third time the family has adopted a pet from Dogs Trust.

Miss Beaton said: 'We feel so lucky to have been able to offer Wonky a home.

'Luckily we live close enough to the 
centre for the vet to continue to keep an eye on her, and she continues 
to get better every day.

'We fell in love with her when we saw her story and she has fast become part of the family.'

Hope enjoys her walks and sleeps at the end of Miss Beaton's bed.

'I think she is a very mischievous personality and affectionate, she loves to cuddle.

'Although she is the family's dog she is my baby.'

Mrs Beaton, also a professional dog walker, said: 'She's a good dog and has been out for walks with the other dogs. She is a bit frightened of going out at night though.'

When the world was first introduced to Hope last month, she cut a pitiful figure.

She was given the nickname Wonky because of 
severe problems with her malformed front legs, which failed to develop after she was 
separated from her mother.

But after intense physiotherapy, the 12-week-old made a fantastic recovery.

Where once she walked awkwardly on bent joints, she can now bound along normally, her tail wagging as she goes.

WONKY WHEN SHE WAS FIRST RESCUED...

Wonky, disabled by malformed joints, was found dumped on a street in Leeds last month

... AND AFTER A FORTNIGHT WITH DOGS TRUST

Since physiotherapy, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross has made remarkable progress

John Wannop, a vet at the Dogs Trust in Leeds, told how the puppy was taken there on February 9 with contracted flexor tendons on the back of her front legs - leading to a condition known as 'knuckling'.

Knuckling of the carpal joints is caused by contraction of the tendons which prevents the wrist joint 
from extending fully - and meant her front feet bended inwards because her 
tendons were too short.

He said that without treatment, it would have been impossible for Hope to straighten her legs.

She was found wandering the streets as a stray and was taken to the Dogs Trust by a member of the public.

Because of her unorthodox looks, there had been concern she would struggle to find a new home.

There were 600 offers from households 
wanting to take care of Wonky and after a thorough vetting process she 
was rehomed with the Beatons.

Amanda Sands, manager at the trust, said: 'The Beaton family proved to be an excellent match for the puppy.

'We are confident that the love and care the family can provide will ensure she has a very happy life.'

With
further physiotherapy, the prognosis for Hope is good, and the trust 
wanted to rehouse her close by so it can keep her under review.

The Beatons renamed the puppy Hope, because the staff at Dogs Trust Leeds didn't give up on her

'It's such a sad case because this was completely preventable if only she'd had the right love and care,' Ms Sands said previously.

'She had not had the right supplements to enable her to grow properly and so her front legs were too weak.

'We
don't know everything about her background but we think that she was 
removed from her mother too early and was then abandoned. She had not 
had the right nutrition and a poor diet meant her front legs were underdeveloped.

'She will need regular trips to the specialist vet to keep a track of her progress.

'It's such a sad case because this was completely preventable if only she'd had the right love and care,' said Amanda Sands, manager at the trust

'With
the right treatment, she will hopefully be able to live a normal life 
and do all the things a puppy should be able to enjoy.

Dogs Trust is the UK's largest dog welfare charity and cares for more than 16,000 stray and abandoned dogs each year through its network of 18
Rehoming Centres across the UK and one in Dublin.

Amanda Francis, spokesman for the charity, said: 'Usually, physical deformity is the 
result of unscrupulous breeders or they haven't been properly looked 
after and most of the time it's something that is completely 
preventable.'

Staff at the charity hoped to rehome the puppy near them so they can keep up her care
