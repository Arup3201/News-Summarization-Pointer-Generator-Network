Mario Balotelli is the classic enigma. One of the world's best when he's in the mood, but infuriating to watch as he fluctuates in and out of on-the-field strops.

Brendan Rodgers says Liverpool's £16million purchase of the striker as a 'calculated risk',but highlighted Balotelli's goalscoring record.

His stats are indeed impressive, but there is far more to look into when evaluating a player like Mario. Here, Sportsmail looks at the most intriguing numbers of the Premier League's latest hitman.

Balotelli had the lowest shot conversion rate in Europe last season 

With AC Milan perhaps over-reliant on the Italian, the onus was on him to create his own magic in Serie A.

Plenty of long shots were attempted, and missed, so much so that his ratio from shots to goals was in a European league of its own.

Balotelli scored just 14 goals from 152 shots, a conversion rate of 13.3 per cent.

Misfire: Balotelli's goal conversion rate in the Serie A last season was the worst in Europe

Just one assist in 54 Premier League appearances for Manchester City

Arriving as a 19-year-old with quite an ego, it was clear from the start that Roberto Mancini would struggle to handle his former Inter Milan protege in England.

Not one for team spirit, Balotelli was credited with just one spirit during his stay at the Etihad Stadium.

Mind you, it couldn't have been more crucial. The striker's  through ball found Sergio Aguero in 2012 against QPR, with the Argentine firing home in stoppage time to secure the Premier League title.

Some time to get that assist: Balotelli set up Sergio Aguero's crucial winner against QPR in 2012

Balotelli at Manchester City 150

Balotelli in Italy 146.8

Premier League... minimum 45 goals 

1) Sergio Aguero 120

2) Thierry Henry 122 

6) Alan Shearer 146.9

Balotelli's minutes-per-goal ratio in Italy is up there with the very best

Aguero's goal in City's 3-1 win against Liverpool on Monday night put him at the top of the charts for impact in the Premier League.

Among those on the list of minutes-per-goals was Alan Shearer, the league's record goalscorer, with 147 minutes per goal.

Credit to Mario, his  ratio in Italy is 146.7. There's no doubting he makes an impression.

Plus side: Balotelli's minutes per goal ratio was superb at Manchester City and in Italy

One of the best: But Balotelli's Serie A recird was better than Alan Shearer's in the Premier League

Balotelli in England

Fouls made 256

Red cards 1

Three red cards in the Premier League, one in Serie A

What is it with Mario and England? Balotelli was never sent off at Inter as a youngster, and was dismissed just once with Milan.

But with City, the Italian was sent off three times. He clashed with Youssouf Mulumbu against West Brom, and was dismissed for two bookable offences in crucial away games against Liverpool and Arsenal.

So that's what Rodgers means about that calculated risk...

Poor record: Balotelli racked up three red cards in the Premier League... he had just one in Serie A

11 yellow cards in Serie A last season, just two for fouls

Sulks, strops and scuffles are three words that best describe Balotelli's attitude in Italy.

Manager's often defend Mario's temper, and it's true he rarely sets into a tackle looking to hurt the opposing player.

But there's only so much a referee will put up with. Defenders know they can wind up the striker, and bookings often follow.

Youngster: Balotelli was raw potential at Inter MIlan, but backed up his talent on the pitch

Bench life: The Italian had to get used to becoming an impact sub at Manchester City
