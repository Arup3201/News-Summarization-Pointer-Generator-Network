An amateur dramatic society is finally staging its production of a musical tackling immigration and racial prejudice - after taking two years to find any black actors.

Milton Musical Society, which is based in New Milton, Hampshire, had decided to produce Ragtime, set in 1902 New York  - but the theatrical group had no black people among its 80 members.

The only black person they knew working in the market town was a pharmacist - who did not sing or act - and the group’s committee said it would be inappropriate to allow white actors to ‘black-up’.

Members had to go on a recruitment drive, 
including approaching certain black people they spotted at work or out 
shopping. They finally found their leading man and lady from towns 30 
miles away.

The society had hoped to stage the 
show last year but had to postpone it upon failing to fill the 10 black 
roles in time. But it now has three black men and three black women in a
55-strong cast.

Society member Jonathan Shiner, 61, 
said: ‘New Milton and the surrounding areas have largely white 
populations, which is reflected in our membership.

‘When we are looking for a white man 
or a white girl we have 100,000 options and therefore rarely have 
trouble filling these roles.

Teamwork: Milton Musical Society decided to produce the musical, which looks at immigration and racism

‘However, with Ragtime, we need 
around 10 black performers, who are able to sing and act to a high 
standard. Unfortunately, there are very few black families in our 
catchment area to begin with.

‘By the time you take out those who 
are the wrong age or wrong gender and those who cannot sing and act we 
lose a further 90 per cent. The odds of finding the right people are 
stacked against us.’

He added: ‘We discussed the option of
blacking up early on but dismissed it immediately because it is not 
appropriate in modern theatre practice.

‘You could put white people in the 
shadows and pretend they are black, or have them on stage as a 
silhouette, but we want to do it properly. Ideally, we would like 10 
black actors and actresses.’

Leading man Alex Clarke, 48, who 
plays Coalhouse Walker, said: ‘It's been a struggle finding black people
from this area to fill the roles.

'I've got about 5,000 friends or 
followers on Facebook and I promoted the musical on there in a bid to find actors but we have still not got all we would like.

‘Most of my black friends and 
followers are from larger cities, rather than rural Hampshire and 
Dorset. Everybody at the society has been incredibly friendly and very 
welcoming.’

Southampton-based race consultant Don
John said: ‘There are not many black people living in this part of the 
country, so I understand why the society has had some difficulty filling
the roles.

‘It's very brave of the society to 
stand by their principles and not go down the easy route of allowing 
white actors to black-up.

Finally on: The society had hoped to stage the show last year but failed to fill the 10 black roles in time

‘Letting white actors black-up would 
be totally inappropriate. Some people might be outraged at white people 
blacking-up but I think we have moved beyond that now.’

The Milton Musical Society was forced to cancel a production called The Top of the Pops Years last year in the wake of the Jimmy Savile (right) sex scandal.

The show was due to be performed at a local hall in November but organisers decided to scrap it following complaints by the public.

The group had already spend thousands of pounds promoting the show with materials featuring Savile. All tickets were refunded.

The 400-seater theatre at the Regent 
Centre, in Christchurch, Dorset, will host five performances of the 
musical, with tickets costing £14.50 each. Rehearsals started one month 
ago.

The society's show posters say: ‘This
show follows the explosive relationships as immigrants arrive on the 
great liners to a new land already struggling with racial harmony and 
injustice.

'This real-life drama, set at
the turn of the century, follows the struggle of the black community to
assert their independence from the white community, against a 
background of the country flooded with European immigrants hungry for a 
new life, and industrial and civil strife.’
