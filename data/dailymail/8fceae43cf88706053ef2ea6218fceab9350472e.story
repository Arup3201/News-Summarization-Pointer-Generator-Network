A mother-of-four from Maine has died from the incredibly-rare human form of Mad Cow Disease.

Sandi Kennedy, who lived in the town of Kennebunk, first became ill with a cough and vertigo in November. Her health deteriorated rapidly and doctors struggled to find what was wrong with her, despite a barrage of tests for neurological conditions and cancer.

By Christmas Eve, the 38-year-old nurse - mother to Tucker, nine, twin boys Asher and Gunner, five and a daughter, Skyler, two - was admitted to hospital with symptoms similar to that of a stroke patient.

Last month she was diagnosed with CJD, a rare and aggressive disease that attacks the brain and has no cure. It affects just one in a million people in the U.S.

She died Monday.

Her husband, Jake Kennedy, said she was a a strong, compassionate and giving woman and always put others before herself.

He told the Portland Press Herald: 'She worked nights at the hospital so she could stay up the next day to take care of the kids.

She was was described as an active, vibrant woman who loved taking her children on trips

'She always did above and beyond to be her best for her children.'

Mr
 Kennedy also spoke of the day they met at his fatherâ€™s funeral. She was
 there to support her friend, who married his older brother.

'I looked in her eyes and just knew,' he added. 'She was so beautiful.'

Kennebunk resident Sarah Nunan has known Mrs Kennedy since 2007 and told the Bangor Daily News their children have grown up together.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and fatal condition that affects the brain.

Symptoms include memory loss, change of personality, abnormal jerking movements and blindness.

The incubation period can last years before initial symptoms surface, but most sufferers will die within around four months of when they do emerge.

The exact origin of CJD is not clear, but it appears to be caused by an abnormal protein called a prion which causes irreversible damage to nerve cells.

One form of the disease, known as variant CJD, is thought to be caused by consuming meat from cows infected with BSE - also known as 'mad cow disease'.

There is currently no cure.

She said: 'She is the strongest person I know, greatest mother, wife and daughter. She always has a smile on her face and laughter in her voice.

'Now is my time to be the rock to her kids, husband and her wonderful family. I love them with all my heart and always will.'

After Mrs Kennedy was diagnosed, the family received an overwhelming amount of support.

Local businesses held fundraisers and a page on fundraising web site www.youcaring.com raised almost $80,000 to help the family pay medical expenses.

A statement on the page posted yesterday said: 'Our hearts are very heavy, but with the love and support from all of you, we find strength through our tears.

'Sandi has passed away and although our sorrow is overwhelming for a life taken too soon, we find comfort knowing she will live on through those she loved so dearly.

'Your continued prayers, support and love for the Kennedy and Tucker family has been truly heartwarming and amazing.'

In September health officials confirmed that a patient at a New Hampshire hospital earlier this year died from Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease.

On May 28, 2002, the United States Food and Drug Administration banned anyone having spent at least six months in certain European countries (or three months in the United Kingdom) from 1980 to 1996 from giving blood.

This was later relaxed to a cumulative total of five years or more of civilian travel in European countries. However, the three-month restriction on travel to the UK - the epicentre of fears over CJD - has not been changed.

In November a U.S ban on beef imported from the EU was lifted after 15 years. America imposed a blanket ban on EU beef imports in the 1990s but the Department for Agriculture has published new regualtions in line with recommendations from the World Organisation for Animal Health.
