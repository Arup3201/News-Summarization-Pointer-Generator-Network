Former secretary of state and potential 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton made it very clear during an appearance earlier this week that she is no fan of Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked thousands of classified documents to journalists and who currently is avoiding criminal charges by hiding out in Russia.

The former first lady attended a discussion at the University of Connecticut on Wednesday and was asked whether Snowden's leaks had done anything to help national security, or the discourse about how far the government can go in terms of domestic intelligence gathering.

Clinton said she feels that the balance between privacy and security is important, but the way Snowden went about bringing the information to light was damaging to national security and may have inadvertently helped terrorist groups.

Harm: Clinton says Snowden's leaks did nothing but harm U.S. security and help terrorists and those who with harm on America

'I think turning over a lot of that material—intentionally or 
unintentionally, because of the way it can be drained—gave all kinds of 
information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist 
groups and the like,' she said.

She went on to say that she doesn't 'understand why he couldn't have been part of the debate at home,' before taking classified documents to other countries.

Clinton went to explain how Snowden could have had a bigger impact if he had turned the information over to officials and asked for whistleblower protection.

'When he emerged and when he absconded with all that material, I was 
puzzled, because we have all these protections for whistleblowers,' 
Clinton said. 'If he were 
concerned and wanted to be part of the American debate, he could have 
been. But it struck me as—I just have to be honest with you—as sort of 
odd that he would flee to China, because Hong Kong is controlled by 
China, and that he would then go to Russia, two countries with which we 
have very difficult cyber-relationships, to put it mildly.'

Phony: Clinton mocked Snowden's question for Putin about whether Russia has any spy programs similar to ones he exposed in the US

Clinton, a former senator from New York before being appointed secretary of state, explained to the audience that having worked in the State Department and the Senate, she is much better informed about the threats that face the United States than the average citizen - many of whom look at Snowden as a hero.

'There are people right this minute trying to figure out how to do harm to Americans and to other innocent people,' Clinton said before explaining that the balance between security and privacy may have shifted towards security in the post-9/11 world, but that the NSA's intelligence gathering is what's helping to prevent another terrorist attack.

After he had stolen the classified documents, Snowden went to Hong Kong, which is ruled by China, before settling in Russia. Clinton said by doing so, Snowden has essentially helped these countries - both of which have somewhat strained relations with United States - gather intelligence about U.S. security forces.

'When I would go to China or I would go to Russia,' she said, 'we would 
leave all my electronic equipment on the plane with the batteries out, 
because this is a new frontier and they're trying to find out not just 
about what we do in our government, they're trying to find out about 
what a lot of companies do and they were going after the personal emails
 of people who worked in the State Department. It's not like the only 
government in the world that is doing anything is the United States.'

'I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia under Putin's authority,' Clinton said of Snowden

Clinton also mocked Snowden's recent call-in to a supposed Q&A with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who granted Snowden temporary asylum in his country after he leaked the classified documents.

During the Q&A Snowden cautiously asked the Russian president if the Russian government had spy programs similar to those of the United States.

Mocking Snowden and Putin's response, Clinton condescendingly paraphrased Putin's answer, saying, 'well from one intelligence professional to another, of course not.'

'Oh, thank you so much,' she continued to mock. 'I mean really.'

Clinton also took a shot at Snowden's claim that he's a passionate defender of privacy and liberty.

'I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia under Putin's authority,' She said.

Putin's government has routinely jailed those who oppose his rule, including members of the punk band Pussy Riot and longtime political opponent Mikhail Khodorkovsky, whom Putin had jailed for eight years.
