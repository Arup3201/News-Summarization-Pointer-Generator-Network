A woman who spent her teenage years trapped in the sex trafficking trade has revealed how the tragic death of a friend she helped recruit has caused her to turn her life around and find a renewed sense of purpose saving other victims.

Leah Albright-Byrd, now 29, has spent the past 11 years recovering from the harrowing experience and processing the terrible guilt she felt after her friend Bridget Gray was strangled to death by a client in Las Vegas on her 22nd birthday.

Albright-Byrd now runs a charity dedicated to trying to save young girls in the same position and has named her non-profit ‘Bridget’s Dream’ in honor of her dead friend.

‘What I wanted to tell Bridget I now tell other girls to help them get free,’ she recently told Katie Curic.

'You [the girls] deserve so much more than being sold on the streets.'

Like many of the young girls who are manipulated into a life of prostitution, Albright-Byrd came from an abusive family background.

At the age of just 14, she ran away from home and while on the streets met a man in his 60s who said she could stay at his home provided she continue to attend school.

But soon after, he insisted that she start contributing to the household and she was given a choice - either sell drugs or herself.

‘You are sold a dream and concept that "this is glamorous life," but you’re being accosted by men twice your age and you start to lose confidence, hope and humanity,’ she told Katie Curic.

Albright-Byrd describes being caught in a psychological trap which she felt she couldn’t leave. She even started to recruit other underage girls, including a 14-year-old girl called Bridget Gray.

‘I had no idea what I was helping her get involved in,’ said Albright-Byrd, who spent four years working for a series of pimps in and around Reno, Nevada.

Gray was in foster care and dating Albright-Byrd’s cousin when the girls first met and Albright-Byrd introduced her to 'the life.'

They later went there separate ways, but kept in touch and Albright-Byrd recalls Gray's unsuccessful attempt to leave prostitution behind.

‘Recidivism is high with the girls,’ she told REJ.com. ‘Most get out and get back in. ...There’s a lot to overcome. You’ve messed up your credit, have no financial literacy, no ID, basic stuff.’

On March 3, 2006, the day of her 22nd birthday, Gray's body was found in a Las Vegas hotel room. She had been strangled by a client - James Flansburg – who claimed she was trying to steal from him. He was convicted of her murder and is serving a 10-to-life prison sentence.

Albright-Byrd had already left prostitution by then, but the shocking news set her back.

‘I went into the worst grief,’ Albright-Byrd said. ‘I was so angry and I felt responsible.’

Leah Albright-Byrd appeared on a recent episode of Katie Curic's show to talk about her experience of being trapped in the sex trafficking trade

It took years of intensive therapy and medication to help her recover from the trauma of living 'the life.'

In 2009 she graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Theology and Counseling Psychology from William Jessup University.

She is now executive director and founder of 'Bridget’s Dream,' an organization dedicated to helping victims of sex trafficking.

The group provides crisis care and family support in the Sacramento and Reno area and according to Albright-Byrd the most important thing they can offer is love and not judge the girls that they help.
