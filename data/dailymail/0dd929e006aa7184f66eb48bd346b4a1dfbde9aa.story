One of the first schools to be given academy status during Michael Gove's tenure as Education Secretary has been conned out of more than £1million in a simple email fraud.

Staff at St Aldhelm's Academy, which posted England's worst GCSE results in 2012, received an email from fraudsters posing as bank workers.

The out-of-the-blue message asked for the sort code of the school's bank account, which finance staff, falling for the con, passed on.

Staff from the school's finance department fell for the scam and handed over the academy's bank details

The criminals then withdrew £1.1million from the school's account.

The money is thought to have been a Government loan for a £9.8million rebuilding programme at the academy in Poole, Dorset.

It is understood that the money came from the Department for Education's Education Funding Agency and Whitehall are demanding it back at the rate of around £75,000 a month.

A source close to the school branded the fraud 'a disaster'.

The police were called in once staff realised they had lost the money.

The scam is believed to have been part of wider organised crime activity, linked to Eastern Europe, that has targeted other institutions in the UK.

Officers from Dorset have joined up with the National Crime Agency and other forces, including the Metropolitan Police, as part of a wider inquiry.

In a statement, headteacher Cheryl Heron said: 'St Aldhelm's was subject to an external fraud in July last year.

'The academy acted swiftly, referred the matter immediately to the police and the case is still being investigated.

'The fraud has not impacted on the day-to-day running of the academy or our recent building work, which was completed on schedule.

'It would be inappropriate to comment further while police investigations are ongoing.'

Conor Burns, the Bournemouth West MP, who has worked closely with the school, said: 'This appalling fraud is a very sad and serious event for the school.

'I have been aware of it for some time and working with ministers to try to support the school as much as possible.

'The key priority for me and them is to ensure that as the school seeks to recover from this blow and that the focus remains firmly on giving the young people who learn there the best possible start in life.

'Having worked very closely with the school and knowing how involved ministers and senior officials are, I am confident that we will soon have positive developments for St Aldhelm's.'

A Department for Education spokesman said: 'St Aldhelm's has been the victim of a sophisticated serious fraud by a third party.

'The matter was immediately referred to the police and Action Fraud by the academy trust and to the EFA. The matter continues to be investigated by the police.'

The school used to be known as Rossmore Community College and relaunched as Poole's first academy in 2010.

It has 504 students aged 11-19.

Local taxpayers have reacted with shock at the crime.

One wrote on an internet message board: 'If the teaching staff are as thick as school finance chiefs it's no wonder they posted the worst GCSE results in the country in 2012.'

Another posted: 'I am absolutely speechless. These scams are well known and have been pretty much since the internet was invented. How could the staff have been caught by it?'
