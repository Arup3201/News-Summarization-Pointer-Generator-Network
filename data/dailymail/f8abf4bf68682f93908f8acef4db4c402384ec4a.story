Wealthy travellers are lining up to be among the first to fly in the lap of ultimate luxury in Etihad Airways’ new £12,500 suite on the world’s largest passenger jet.

The Gulf carrier announced that The Residence, an ‘apartment in the sky’ featuring three rooms, a Savoy Academy-trained personal butler and an in-flight chef who can create custom menus, has sold out for the initial ten flights between Abu Dhabi and London Heathrow Airport.

Built by B/E Aerospace in the UK, the ultra-luxurious, wifi-enabled cabin is the crown jewel of Etihad’s first Airbus A380, which has a total capacity of just under 500 passengers.

With room for two people, The Residence boasts a double bedroom, living room and an en-suite shower room with unrivalled hospitality.

Measuring 125 square feet, The Residence is the first of its kind and has been created by leading interior designers and hospitality experts with passenger comfort and privacy in mind, the airline said.

The living room boasts a Poltrona Frau leather sofa with a retractable ottoman controlled by touchscreen, two dining tables, chilled drinks cabinet and 32-inch flat screen TV.

When it’s time for a nap guests will retreat to a bedroom decorated with delicate fabrics and furnished with a natural fibre mattress, Egyptian cotton sheets and a choice of pillows.

Bookings for the high-end suite are running far ahead of the usual 50 per cent reservation rate for first-class berths, Etihad chief executive James Hogan said at an industry conference in Dubai, according to Bloomberg.

He told the conference: ‘We’ve been quite happy with the take-up. There’s a market there.’

The £12,500 price covers a one-way trip for two people and includes a chauffeur for transport to and from the airport, and private check-in and lounge.

Superjumbo jet: Etihad Airways has ordered ten Airbus A380s and the superjumbo jet will also service Sydney and New York

Commercial flights between Abu Dhabi and London begin next month as the first of ten Etihad A380s goes into service.

The superjumbo jet will also be operated on routes to Sydney and New York in 2015.

With the high-end suite the United Arab Emirates flag carrier is hoping to lure wealthy travellers from rivals Emirates, Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines.

Peter Baumgartner, Etihad’s chief commercial officer, said: ‘The Residence will set Etihad Airways apart from the rest of the industry and allow us to provide the complete range of world-class products and services to cater for the individual tastes of every VIP traveller.

‘This is the culmination of five years of intensive effort and research into how Etihad Airways can provide an unparalleled VIP experience. Without doubt, we are ushering in a new era of luxury travel in commercial aviation.’ 

First class: Each First Apartment offers privacy in a much smaller space compared to The Residence

Modern travel: A look inside the first class cabin, which is divided into 'apartments' 

For those who find the one-way price of The Residence too steep, they can opt for a First Apartment in the first class section.

Etihad’s First Apartments may not come with a personal concierge or chef, but they do offer privacy in a much smaller space.

Each compartment is upholstered with Poltrona Frau leather with a wide armchair and ottoman which opens into a bed measuring 81 inches.

Welcome aboard: The luxury first class section has a 'lobby' where passengers can sit and enjoy refreshments in comfort

Here's looking at you: Each First Apartment is equipped with a TV, a vanity cabinet, chilled mini-bar and wardrobe

Guests in the first class section can be joined by a companion for a meal or meeting, or if they are travelling with a partner the divider between apartments can be lowered to join rooms.

Each First Apartment is equipped with an adjustable 24-inch flat screen TV, a vanity cabinet with lighting and space for personal effects, a chilled mini-bar and a wardrobe.

The first class bathroom boasts an ‘energising shower’.

Passengers in business class fly in comfortable studios that feature a seat which converts into a fully-flat bed.
