Mitt Romney is today hoping to seal his status as the Republican presidential front-runner with a thus-far elusive victory in the conservative Deep South.

The pivotal primaries in Alabama and Mississippi come as a new poll appears to prove just how non-progressive some GOP voters in the region are.

An astonishing 29 per cent of Republican voters in Mississippi believe that interracial marriage should be illegal.

Front-runner: Mitt Romney addresses supporters outside the Whistle Stop Cafe in Mobile, Alabama, yesterday. A poll has revealed that 21 per cent of GOP voters in the state oppose interracial marriage, rising to 29 per cent in Mississippi

This number falls to a still significant 21 per cent among self-declared GOP supporters in Alabama, according to the survey by Public Police Polling.

In Mississippi, 54 per cent said they were in favour of mixed-race marriage, a figure that increased to 67 per cent in Alabama.

Interracial marriage has been legal across the U.S. since June 1967, when a Supreme Court ruling banned anti-miscegenation laws then enforced in 16 states.

Today's closely-forced primaries in Alabama and Mississippi offer Mr Romney a key opportunity in a region that has been slow to embrace him.

The primaries are also poised to render a possible final verdict on Newt Gingrich's Southern-focused candidacy.

With polls showing an unexpectedly tight race in the conservative heartland states, Mr Romney made a campaign appearance yesterday in Alabama - a clear indication he is eyeing a potential win there.

The former Massachusetts governor campaigned with Southern comedian Jeff Foxworthy and poked fun at his own lack of hunting skills, saying he hoped to set out with an Alabama friend who 'can actually show me which end of the rifle to point'.

Still fighting: Fellow candidate Newt Gingrich addresses the Alabama Republicans forum at the Alabama Theater in Birmingham last night

Battling to become Mr Romney's main conservative challenger, Mr Gingrich and Rick Santorum both spoke at an energy forum in Mississippi and took questions on religion in public life at a presidential forum in Birmingham, Alabama.

They took sharp aim at President Barack Obama, with Mr Santorum labeling the president's foreign policy 'pathetic' and Mr Gingrich taunting Obama as 'President Algae' for an energy speech in which Mr Obama spoke of research that would allow oil and gas to be developed from algae one day.

Mr Gingrich has focused his campaign in recent weeks on rising gas prices, promising to bring the price to $2.50 per gallon if elected.

The Southern showdown comes as new polling showed a steep drop in Mr Obama's approval ratings amid escalating prices at the pump and renewed turbulence in the Middle-East.

A Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 46 per cent of those surveyed approve the way the president is handling his job, and 50 per cent disapprove. A New York Times/CBS poll found 41 per cent approval, and 47 per cent disapproval.

A win in either Mississippi or Alabama would be an important breakthrough for Mr Romney, easing concerns that the Harvard-educated north-easterner cannot win the party's most conservative and evangelical voters.

Mr Santorum, who has angled to campaign head-to-head with Mr Romney, pressed the case again that Mr Gingrich should consider stepping aside.

Speaking in Biloxi, he said: 'People of Mississippi and Alabama want a conservative. If they want a conservative nominee for sure, they can do that by lining up behind us and making this race clearly a two-person race outside of the South.'

Mr Santorum planned to watch returns from Louisiana, which holds its primary on March 24.

While Mr Gingrich insists he plans to remain in the race until the Republican National Convention in August, his campaign's survival essentially rests on winning both of today's primaries.

The former House speaker has pursued an all-Southern strategy, but he has won only South Carolina and Georgia, the latter the state he represented in Congress for 20 years.

A fourth candidate, Ron Paul, is not competing actively in the two contests.

Hawaii is also holding a primary today, but none of the GOP hopefuls campaigned there.

Mr Romney has more delegates than his rivals combined, and is amassing them at a rate that puts him on track to clinch control of nomination before the convention opens next summer.

He has 454 of the 1,144 delegates needed to win the nomination. Mr Santorum has 217; Mr Gingrich 107 and Paul 47.
