Paul Gascoigne was drinking two litres of gin and 15 cans of Stella Artois a day before he was rushed to a rehab clinic, a former friend has claimed.

One time housemate Shane Abbott, 36, has also claimed the alcoholic former England star was taking up to 30 antidepressant Valium pills a day and injecting cocaine.

Mr Abbott, who was his flatmate until two weeks ago, filmed Gazza and released the footage to the Daily Star.

The shocking video shows Gascoigne at the depths of his alcoholism and mental torment.

Unsteady: Gascoigne had to be helped along when he was out in Bournemouth last week

This latest clip, which comes after he was filmed shaking and slurring his speech at an after-dinner event last month, will shock fans who remember him for the wonderful player he was.

Gascoigne travelled to Phoenix for treatment but had a spell in intensive care at the weekend after what was believed to be a bad reaction to his detox programme.

A collection of England players and FA bosses have given £40,000 to help pay Gascoigne's US hospital costs.

Their donation was via the national 
team's own official charity, the 'England Footballers Foundation', which
has raised over £2.5million since its was formed in 2007.

The ex-England maestro has already 
reached £100,000 in hospital bills - he may be there a few more days - 
and it may cost £7,500 every week after that as he stays in an Arizona 
clinic.

Even before donating through the 
team's charity, England players Jack Wilshere, Frank Lampard, John Terry
and Wayne Rooney gave money to support Gascoigne.

An FA spokesman said that skipper Steven Gerrard was leading the charge to raise funds for Gascoigne.

Team boss Roy Hodgson said last week: 'Steven has gone to the FA and told them the players want to contribute.'

Gerrard added: 'We've spoken to the FA and made it clear that we're prepared to help if needed.'

DJ Chris Evans, among others, helped 
fund his flights and original hospital bills when he went to the US last
week, and other former players, such as Jamie Redknapp, Gareth 
Southgate, Chris Waddle and Vinnie Jones were also about to donate.

Manchester United striker Rooney also sent a personal message to the player whom he saw as an inspiration.

'Paul Gascoigne was a hero of mine growing up and it's sad for everyone to see and read about,' Rooney said.

'My best wishes are with him and hopefully he can get himself out of this.'
