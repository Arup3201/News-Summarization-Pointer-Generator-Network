She's been working since the age of seven and has had little break from her illustrious career.

And now Angelina Jolie's surgeon has revealed how the actress refused to let her decision to have a double mastectomy prevent her from doing her work.

In a blog post on the Pink Lotus Breast Center website, Dr Kristi Funk detailed how the 37-year-old actress returned to work just four days after having the initial mastectomy procedure.

Describing the scene, Dr Funk writes that Angelina was recovering at home but still managing to concentrate on her next project.

The blog post reads: 'On day four after her mastectomies, I 
was pleased to find her not only in good spirits with bountiful energy, 
but with two walls in her house covered with freshly assembled 
storyboards for the next project she is directing.

Taking charge: Dr Kristi Funk was one of the main surgeon's on Angelina's case

'The next day she had her first injection
of saline into the expanders, thus beginning the process that would 
gradually prepare the tissues for the final stage of her operations, 
reconstruction.

'A 
second saline fill occurred on March 4. Over the next four weeks she was
hard at work.'

Dr Funk added: 'To a large extent, I believe recovery reflects expectation. Angelina expected to feel well, to be active.'

It is thought that the project Angelina was working on is the story of second world war air force officer Louis Zamperini, who spent 47 days on a raft after a plane crash before being captured by the Japanese.

Angelina announced last year that she would be directing the film version of Laura Hillenbrand's book Unbroken, saying in a statement: 'I read Laura Hillenbrand’s brilliant book, and I was so moved by Louie Zamperini’s heroic story, I immediately began to fight for the opportunity to make this film,” Jolie said in a statement.  “Louie is a true hero and a man of immense humanity, faith and courage. I am deeply honored to have the chance to tell his inspiring story.'

Other project Angelina has in the pipeline include Kung Fu Panda 3 and Salt 2.

The Pink Lotus blog also details how Angelina's fiancé Brad Pitt offered his unwavering support throughout her three months of operations.

Dr Funk writes: 'On February 2, 2013, Angelina was in the
operating room for the first operation, the nipple delay. Her partner 
was on hand to greet her as soon as she came around from the anesthetic,
as he was during each of the operations.'

Meanwhile, Angelina has revealed she is 
'grateful and overwhelmed' by the outpouring of public support 
following the publication of the op ed in the New York Times which 
detailed her decision.

Angelina decided to have the procedures after 
discovering she was a carrier of the BRCA1 gene - meaning she had an 87%
chance of contracting breast cancer.

And New York Times columnist Nicholas
Kristof has revealed the actress asked him to pass on her gratitude 
following the public's response to her op ed in the paper.

Kristof tweeted: 'I've spoken to Angelina Jolie several times in the last few days, and she has been so strong, so brave, so determined.

'She wants to use her medical issues to nurture a national conversation on health options. No self pity; she just wants to help.

Unwavering support: The blog also reveals Brad was by Angelina's side as she woke from every operation

'Angelina Jolie also asked me to thank everyone: She is SO grateful and overwhelmed by the outpouring of public support.

'And she's thrilled and grateful to see people taking this and having serious, empowering discussions of women's health.'

The
news that Angelina is a BRCA1 carrier was made all the more personal by the fact that Angelina lost her 
mother Marcheline Bertrand to ovarian cancer when she was just 56.

Revealing her decision to have 
the surgery, Angelina said it was the support of 
her six children and fiancé Brad which got her through the operation.

Brave choice: Angelina looked in good spirits as
she attended the Women in the World event following the initial stage 
of the procedures

In the editorial piece entitled 'My Medical Choice', Angelina wrote: 'I am 
fortunate to have a partner, Brad Pitt, who is so loving and supportive.
So to anyone who has a wife or girlfriend going through this, know that
you are a very important part of the transition. Brad was at the Pink 
Lotus Breast Center, where I was treated, for every minute of the 
surgeries.

'We managed to 
find moments to laugh together. We knew this was the right thing to do 
for our family and that it would bring us closer. And it has.'

Brad later released his own statement praising his 'heroic Angie' following her difficult decision.

In a statement to London's Evening 
Standard, Brad said: 'Having witnessed this decision firsthand, I find 
Angie’s choice, as well as so many others like her, absolutely heroic. I
thank our medical team for their care and focus.

Tragic loss: Angelina's mother Marcheline Bertrand sadly died from ovarian cancer at the age of 56

'All I want for is for her to have a long and healthy life, with myself and our children. This is a happy day for our family.'

Angelina also revealed she is proud of her children for being so brave during her operations, which began on February 16th with the initial removal, before she had the reconstruction operation on April 20th.

She writes: 'It is reassuring that they see 
nothing that makes them uncomfortable. They can see my small scars and 
that’s it.

'Everything else is just Mommy, the same as she always was. 
And they know that I love them and will do anything to be with them as 
long as I can.'

Following the operations, Angelina's risk of contracting breast cancer has now dropped to under 5%.

She wrote:
'My doctors estimated that I had an 87% risk of breast cancer and a 50%
risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of 
each woman.

'Only a 
fraction of breast cancers result from an inherited gene mutation. Those
with a defect in BRCA1 have a 65% risk of getting it, on average. Once
I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to 
minimize the risk as much I could. I made a decision to have a 
preventive double mastectomy.

Still working hard: Angelina attended the G8 summit in London on April 11 with William Hague, after the initial operation but prior to the process being finished

A
lot going on: Angelina was still in the midst of her procedures when 
she attended the Foreign Ministers G8 meeting in Lancaster House on 
April 11 in London, England 

'I
started with the breasts, as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my
risk of ovarian cancer, and the surgery is more complex.

'On April 27, I finished the three 
months of medical procedures that the mastectomies involved. During that
time I have been able to keep this private and to carry on with my 
work.

'My chances of developing breast 
cancer have dropped from 87% to under 5%. I can tell my 
children that they don’t need to fear they will lose me to breast 
cancer.'
