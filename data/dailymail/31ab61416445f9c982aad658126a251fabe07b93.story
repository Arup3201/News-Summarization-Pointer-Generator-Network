He prides himself on being something of a hunk - if his latest Calvin Klein shoot is anything to go by.

So Justin Bieber probably won't take too kindly to being mistaken for a girl when he dined out at one of his favourite restaurants this week.

The singer had turned up to the State Social House in Los Angeles with four friends only to find his usual perch had been taken by a meeting of gay Republicans.

Undeterred, he took a seat in the private area, known as the Attic, anyway as the group discussed gay rights.

As it was, his presence initially went unnoticed because  the meeting just thought he was a 'butcher version of Miley Cyrus', they later explained.

The Los Angeles chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans were holding a meeting in a private seating area in the State Social House called The Attic when Bieber sat with some friends in the corner

Ben Coleman, the event chairman of the Los Angeles chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, said the restaurant manager had informed him 'some other people' wanted to 'hang out in the corner'.

He told the Jillian Barberie and John Phillips show on 790 KABC: 'I went downstairs and someone I knew said "did you see Justin Bieber just went upstairs?"

'I went back and looked around the corner and I saw the group and, literally, I didn't see Justin Bieber, I just saw a bunch of girls.

'I got a closer look and said, oh yeah that's the Biebs, for sure. But he looked like a butcher version of Miley Cyrus.'

The group were listening to a talk by Ronald Reagan's former personal assistant Peggy Grande at the time. 

The Bieber effect: Angry fans of Justin send death threats to married model Lara Stone following their racy Calvin Klein advert 

Mr Coleman said he tried to get a picture of Bieber, but was flatly refused.

According to Gossip Cop, he posted on Facebook: 'I tried to get a pic of the Biebs in front of the Log Cabin banner... with Peggy and I, but the bodyguards said no. 

'And they had guns. So that didn't happen. Otherwise it was a dream come true.' 

Justin Beiber provoked a storm last week after he was pictured topless in a Calvin Klein advert while being embraced by supermodel Lara Stone.

TMZ reported that some of his fans had issued deaths threats to Miss Stone, who is seen caressing his stomach in the shoot. 

One user named @ameliebelieber6 wrote: 'I'll kill that girl..' then mentioned Justin and Lara, followed by emoticons that depicted three guns and one knife pointing at two faces.

Another user is said to have written: 'hi b***** i hate u. touch justins d**** again and ill kill u im not joking.' while another added: 'back off or i'll kill you, please and thanks. no pressue :).'
