Prince Charles, who is said to be ready to take over the management of the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk 

He is already taking part in a ‘gentle succession’ from his mother, representing the Queen on a growing number of state occasions. Now Prince Charles is stepping into his father’s shoes, too.

The Mail on Sunday has learned that the Duke of Edinburgh is privately handing management of Sandringham to his eldest son. 

The job includes overseeing arable, livestock and fruit farms, property and a 240-acre country park.

The 93-year-old Duke is responsible for several estates, including Balmoral, Windsor and Sandringham in Norfolk, where the Royal Family has just enjoyed Christmas.

But local sources say Prince Philip started to pass control of Sandringham’s 20,000 acres to Charles this year. 

The Duke will continue to be consulted over changes, but Charles will have a more hands-on role.

‘We understand Prince Philip has handed the management over to his son,’ said a source. 

‘Charles is now taking a very close interest in the estate and its running. He has excellent ideas and we are expecting to see different things happening.’

Estate workers say they expect to see more of the Prince in the coming months as he implements changes, such as more organic farming.

Sandringham has been a private home for British monarchs since 1862. As well as the Queen’s country retreat it is a successful commercial estate. 

Hundreds of fields are leased to commercial farmers.

The change has not yet been officially announced and Buckingham Palace last night said it could not comment on what might happen as it is ‘the Queen’s private estate’. 

But sources close to the Prince of Wales say handing management to Charles would be ‘a natural decision’.

Although he is in excellent health, the change will be viewed as further evidence the Duke is scaling back his duties. 

Philip has cut down overseas travel in recent years but carries out hundreds of engagements for the Queen each year. The Duke began managing Sandringham when he married the Queen.

The huge estate includes tidal mudflats, woodland and wetland, and produces everything from wheat to Christmas trees. But it is most famous for its apples and apple juice.

The Duke spends most of his time at Windsor or Sandringham. Like his son, he is known for forward thinking, and turned the estates into successful enterprises. At Windsor, he set up a farm shop to generate income.

Charles turned his own estate, Highgrove and the Duchy Home Farm, into a model of sustainable farming. He visits Sandringham at Christmas and usually stays there at least once a year.

‘Charles is likely to turn the whole estate organic,’ said the source. ‘He’ll do things like introduce rewards for environmentally friendly farming. 

Philip’s a passionate conservationist but has very set ways on how the estate should be run. He doesn’t like outsiders interfering.’

Though Sandringham is ‘green’ (5,000 trees are planted each year and all food waste, glass, plastics and paper are recycled) it does not have some of the more modern green techniques Charles uses at Highgrove –such as irrigating the land with rainwater and using bio-dynamic farming methods.
