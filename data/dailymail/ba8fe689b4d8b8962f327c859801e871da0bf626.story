 Lines form around the block in New York on Black Friday, the
notorious holiday shopping day marked by major sales. Not only can New Yorker’s
save money, now they can roll around in it too.

Stefan Bondell’s
show, ‘The Black Box’ opened today at The Hole Gallery and allows visitors to
stomp their feet on $1 million dollars of shredded cash. The show also exhibits
four black ten-by-ten foot paintings meant to mimic the black box of an airplane.

‘Like the black box of an airplane or the expression as
applied to covert ops, insider trading or government surveillance, the painter
thought of this installation as his own black box, where his concerns and
opinions are thrashed out in each of the paintings,’ said The Hole Gallery’s
website of Bondell’s first exhibition in the space.

Stefan Bondell employs currency and poetry in several of his art exhibitions

The shredded US cash which fills the floor of the exhibition
space is meant to ‘put the financial side of the art market like so much waste
underfoot, instead of infecting the paintings themselves,’ said The Hole.

The barely
recognizable shredded currency is also said to be linked to how money ties
together the cultural signifier in each work.

Bondell told Page Six that in addition to the symbolic
meaning of the shredded cash, ‘I wanted people to be able to kick and stomp
around in a million dollars on Black Friday.’

Money, money, money must be funny: when you're Stefan Bondell

Stefan Bondell's first exhibition at The Hole gallery opens today in New York

Bondell is a poet as well as a visual artist and will be
hosting a poetry reading on December 12th in which he will read his poem ‘Black
Box.’ Jonas Mekas, Bob Holman, Lizzi Bougastos, Suheir Hammad, and many other
poets will also be sharing their works.

This is not the first time Bondell has used US currency in
his artwork. In his 2010 exhibition called, ‘Currentcy,’ at New York Marble
Cemetery, he pasted money onto canvas and splattered in in black paint and real
blood. He also held a poetry reading called ‘Oil Kills Poets Spill’ along with
his exhibition shortly after the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

‘The Black Box’ opens just before Miami’s Art Basel, an art
festival known for attracting posh visitors with cash to spend. Page Six
reports that ‘The Black Box’ opens after Qatari Royal Shekha Mayassa  bint Hamad al-Thani spent $142 million ob ‘Three
Studies of Lucian Freud,’ by Frances Bacon. This is the highest paid price for
art an auction ever.

The Hole Website also talks about how Bondell’s exhibition
is a breath of fresh air in a world where, ‘skyrocketing auction prices distract
the compassionate art viewer from looking at and engaging with art.’ 

Black Friday is known for having amazing holiday sales and long, long lines
