The husband of the Sandy Hook Elementary School principal who was killed in the shooting has retired from his job at the local middle school as he braces for life without his wife.

George Hochsprung met his wife Dawn when they both worked at Rogers Park Middle School- she as the assistant principal and he as the seventh grade math teacher- before she left to head up the elementary school.

Though he is 70-years-old, and well over the state’s average retirement age of 59, his move was unexpected but not surprising given the shooting.

Emotional: George got choked up and Erica began weeping during an interview about the principal's life

‘His wife — she was that type of educator who gave her life for her kids,’ Danbury superintendent Sal Pascarella told The Hartford Courant.

‘George was that type of educator.’

He did not release a public statement after he decided to leave his job, but he did speak out immediately after the December 14 shooting and he was understandably emotional.

'Dawn and I built this beautiful house in the Adirondacks, our dream,' Mr Hochsprung told CNN.

'And the dream was a chronological dream it was going to be Dawn's house: I was going to die because I'm much older than Dawn, it was going to be Dawn's house.

Happy: George Hochsprung said he and wife Dawn planned to spend 
years together at a house they had built

'Dawn's grandchildren and all these children could use the house on the lake and it would be wonderful.’

The Hochsprung family is made up of George's three daughters from his first marriage, Dawn's two daughters from her first marriage, and their collective 11 grandchildren.

'We built rooms downstairs for kids and it was going to be Dawn's house ultimately, with all the children. And now it's me - I don't think I can do that,' he said last month.

One thing the family has to look forward to, however, is Mrs Hochsprung's daughter Erica Lafferty's wedding this summer. She and her fiance appeared in several television interviews in the wake of the shooting, talking about the life Dawn lived.

'I had a really hard time not being mad about it but that's who she was,' Lafferty said of the way that Dawn tried to stop the shooter.

Support: Lafferty, who weds this summer, appeared on the show with her fiance, Christopher Smegielski

Where they met: George Hochsprung was teaching middle school math when he met Dawn (right) who was an assistant principal at the middle school at the time, before she left to work at Sandy Hook Elementary School

'She faced every single problem that she ever had in her life head on.

'My cousin referred to her as a 
'bull' yesterday. There's no stopping Dawn when she has a mission. She 
gets it done and she gives it everything she has.'

As Lafferty struggled to control her tears, her fiance stood beside her.

'For some reason Dawn loved me and it's my job now to be there for her daughter,' Smegielski said.

'I accept that job with open arms and I'll be there for her in any way possible.'

Tales of her heroism are helping Mrs Hochsprung's relatives process their grief, but only slightly.

'Dawn put herself in jeopardy and I 
have been angry about that - angry - until just now, today, when I met 
the two women who she told to go under shelter while she confronted the 
gunman and she could have avoided that, but she didn't and I knew she 
wouldn't,' Mr Hochsprung said.

'I'm not angry anymore, I'm just very sad.'

During the shooting, Dawn 'ran out, 
and actually tried to subdue the killer. I don't know where that comes 
from, Dawn was five-foot-two.'

Since the Danbury Board of Education 
officially accepted Mr Hochsprung’s resignation on Wednesday night, it 
is now teachers who are upset over the departure of an accomplished 
colleague.

‘He was one of the most creative people you ever were to meet. He knows his content, but connects with kids,’ Mr Pascarella said of Mr Hochsprung, who taught for 40 years and four months.

‘You just can’t replace him,’ he said to The Courant.
