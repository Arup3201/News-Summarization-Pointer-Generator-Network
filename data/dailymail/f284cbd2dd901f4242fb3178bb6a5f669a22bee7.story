Perth teenager Stephen Milne is looking to bring the curtain down on a stunning Commonwealth Games by doing 'something special' in the 1500 metres freestyle final.

But the 19-year-old will have to pull out something remarkable to surpass his Glasgow 2014 achievements so far.

Milne was part of the Scotland relay team that pushed hot favourites Australia all the way on Sunday night in the 4x200m freestyle relay before eventually claiming a silver medal.

And he followed that up on Monday lunchtime by challenging reigning champion and Olympic silver medallist Ryan Cochrane to the very end in his 1500m heat, knocking more than 12 seconds off his personal best in the process.

Milne posted a time of 15:03.38 minutes, finishing just nine-hundredths of a second behind the Canadian after 30 lengths of the Tollcross pool.

Milne, who also made the 400m final, said: 'I was very happy with how the swim went. I just focus on the wee bits on how to improve for (Tuesday's) final and hopefully I do well then.

'Me and my coach had worked pretty well throughout the season and taper seems to be going quite well, but I know that the job's not done yet.

'I still need to refocus for the final and hopefully do something special then.'

Milne and team-mates Daniel Wallace, Duncan Scott and Robbie Renwick almost brought the house down on Sunday night in the relay, which was neck and neck until the final length. The Scots finished less than two seconds behind Australia and inside the champions' previous Games record.

Milne said: 'The 1500 is the event I have looked forward to the most. I'm glad it's come but I was really, really happy to do the 4x2. It was a huge privilege to be with those guys swimming in that final.

'I will never forget that night. The team did so well, including the guys in the heats to help us rest up for the evening. It was a good effort.

'We knew from last time the boys did silver and this time we wanted to do as well if no better. We all swam really well.'

The Tollcross crowd have responded to all the competitors but especially the Scottish swimmers and Milne is determined to repay their support.

'It's absolutely amazing, the crowd has been wonderful and it's really good to have all that cheering for us,' he said. 'It's inspiring for us and we like to put on a good show for them.'
