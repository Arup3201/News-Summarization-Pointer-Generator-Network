A former Miss Delaware, who was stripped of her crown for being too old, revealed today that she is not giving up the fight to compete in the national Miss America contest.

Amanda Longacre, 24, told Today on Monday that she has been nothing but honest with the pageant organizers and that she was willing to sue over the decision to pass her crown to runner-up Brittany Lewis.

She said: 'I won the title of Miss Delaware, I am 
Miss Delaware. I have been nothing but honest from the beginning. I did 
not know that rule. I asked from the beginning if I was eligible and 
they said yes, they signed off on my contract, they had my birth 
certificate, I gave them everything.'

Miss Congeniality: Amanda Longacre, 24, (pictured today) who was stripped of her Miss Delaware crown for being too old, is not giving up the fight to compete in the national Miss America contest

Miss Longacre turns 25 in October and the rules state that beauty queens must be between 17 and 24 throughout 2014 to compete in the September Miss America pageant.

After less than two weeks as Miss Delaware, the beauty queen was forced to hand back her crown when the age discrepancy was discovered by the national competition.

The 24-year-old wept on camera last week as she described the heartache of losing her coveted title. However she is allowed to keep a $9,000 scholarship award which was part of her winnings. Runner-up Miss Lewis will also receive the $9,000 scholarship.

For Miss Longacre, however, the fight is all about a title which she believes is rightfully hers. She appeared on the Today show with her attorney who said they were willing to sue the competition organizers over the matter.

The Penn State graduate said on Monday: 'I've gotten a lot of support and I'm so appreciative of it. I feel so much love from my state, and even from outside of my state people have been supporting me.

'I've been nothing but honest since the beginning and they don't think it's right either.'

She added: 'This is about the title of Miss Delaware that I rightfully won. I want to represent the people of Delaware. I want to be a social worker. This was a great start to a fabulous career for me and it's still going to be a fabulous career for me.'

She said that although the age rule is in her contract, she assumed she was eligibleÂ because the Miss Delaware organization signed off.

'I didn't know the rule, I also competed at the local level and it's been several months. You put your trust in an organization to know their own rules. So when you come forward and you're honest and you put the time and money in, this is not fair.'

Miss Longacre said that she planned to fight all the way to compete in Miss America.

Miss Longacre, from Bear, Delaware, last week told Today: 'I lost everything and they want to erase me forever.'

She added: 'It really hurts because when your peers vote you for Miss Congeniality, you work so hard to get to this position. I haven't been doing pageants for very long, this is all brand new to me.'

Miss Longacre sobbed on camera on Friday saying she was devastated at losing the chance to represent the people of Delaware

The 24-year-old, who wants to be a social worker, said that the Miss Delaware Scholarship Organization signed a contract saying that she could compete after she provided her birth certificate and driving license.

Miss Longacre said that the Miss American pageant has ignored her attempts to contact them.

First runner-up Brittany Lewis of 
Wilmington was crowned last Thursday and will go on to represent 
Delaware in the national competition.

In
 a statement to MailOnline on Friday, the Miss Delaware Scholarship 
Organization said: 'Following the Miss Delaware Pageant, it was 
determined that Amanda Longacre exceeded the age requirement in order to
 be eligible to compete therefore, the Miss Delaware 2014 title is 
awarded to Brittany Lewis.

'The Miss Delaware Pageant is proud to congratulate Brittany and wishes Amanda the very best on her future endeavors.'

Brittany Lewis was crowned Miss Delaware 2014 by Miss Delaware 2012 Alyssa Murray of Selbyville in a short ceremony on Thursday evening inside Dover Downs Hotel and Casino.   Amanda Longacre was dethroned last Wednesday for being too old
