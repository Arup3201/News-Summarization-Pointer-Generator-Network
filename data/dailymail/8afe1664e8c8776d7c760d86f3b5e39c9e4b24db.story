Defiant: Shaun Wright, pictured with Ed Miliband in 2012, was working 'as normal' on Thursday despite increasing public pressure to resign

David Cameron added his weight to the growing demands for Rotherham’s crime tsar to quit his £85,000-a-year role in the wake of the child exploitation scandal.

In an unequivocal statement, the Prime Minister said that Shaun Wright should ‘resign and take full responsibility for what happened’.

But Mr Wright, the police and crime commissioner for South Yorkshire, was still clinging to his job last night.

He continued to work ‘as normal’ even while protesters gathered outside his office and his deputy quit, calling for him to do the same.

Tracey Cheetham had been under little public pressure to go. However, the mother-of-three decided she could no longer carry on amid the outrage over Mr Wright’s defiant stand.

She said: ‘It is vital for people to have confidence in the office of police and crime commissioner and, with this in mind, I believe it would have been the right thing for Shaun Wright to resign.

'This has become even more apparent given the overwhelming opinion of the public – as they are the people to whom the commissioner is ultimately accountable.

‘I am incredibly sad that this issue has become centred on one person and we seem to have lost focus on the most important factor in all this – the 1,400 victims who were failed.’

Mrs Cheetham, who earned £45,000 as Mr Wright’s number two, criticised the ‘political point-scoring’ and instead called for more to be done to bring the criminals to justice.

One Rotherham victim, who was abused at 14 by an older man, told the Mail that Mr Wright ‘should be ashamed of himself’.

Jessica, now 29, said: ‘The more he holds on to his job, the harder it will be for victims to move forward.

‘He needs to accept his part in it and quit.’ Mr Wright, who was a member of the Labour party until he quit on Wednesday and has met Ed Miliband, cannot be sacked by the police or by politicians because he was elected by the public in 2012.

Police commissioners can only be removed from office at the polling booths or if they have committed a serious crime.

Local crime boards are able to suspend PCCs if they are charged with an offence that carries a maximum sentence of more than two years. They can then be sacked if they  are convicted.

Labour backbencher John Mann, who has called for an outside police force to investigate the Rotherham scandal, said such arrangements  were ‘absurd’.‘The police commissioner roles are ridiculous,’ he said. ‘They should be scrapped.’

Mr Mann wrote a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May calling for Mr Wright to be investigated for ‘wilful neglect of duty’.

In his letter, he wrote: ‘The report by Alexis Jay OBE states in great detail that during his time as the portfolio holder responsible for children’s services Shaun Wright received three  separate reports concerning child abuse and failed to act on them.

It is clear that as a democratically elected councillor with the specific responsibility for children’s services Shaun Wright failed to act despite three separate warnings.

‘Not only did Shaun Wright fail to act, he failed to inform other  members of his own party of the serious problems of young girls being abused, raped and beaten on a systematic basis.’

Mr Mann’s letter added: ‘It is my view that the facts provided in the Alexis Jay report provide evidence of the potential for wilful neglect of duty by public officials, including the current South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright.

‘I look forward to an appropriate police investigation to determine whether such an offence has been committed and if so by whom.’

There was no sign of Mr Wright either at his home or at his office in Barnsley yesterday. His spokesman said he was working.
