Tragic: Benjamin Pirofsky, 30, was declared dead at the scene after crashing into a blue SUV

A 'Good Samaritan' driver chased a woman for several blocks after she fled the scene of an accident that left a motorcyclist dead.

Thomas Stanley, 47, was driving behind 30-year-old Benjamin Pirofsky's motorcycle on North Federal Highway in Fort Lauderdale, Florida when he claims to have seen a Ford SUV travelling in the opposite direction turn directly in front of them, causing Mr Pirofksky to fatally plough into the car.

Mr Stanley says he was shocked to see the SUV's alleged driver Nadia Verdon, 42, leave the scene of the accident last Friday, so followed her for several blocks, eventually taking a photograph of her licence plate which police later used to track her down.

New York-born Mr Pirofksky, who had lived with his aunt nearby Coral Springs for three years, had taken his motorcycle for a ride to help him calm down ahead of a house move to Fort Lauderdale, according to the Sun-Sentinel.

But at around 9.30pm last Friday, the Volkswagen dealership finance manager was fatally injured after an SUV pulled in front of his bike as he drove southbound on the busy North Federal Highway.

Mr Stanley said he was certain the motorcyclist had been killed when he witnessed the high-speed crash as Mr Pirofksky's helmet flew off in a different direction while his body and motorcycle were still travelling through the air.

Unable to get the crash image out of his head, Mr Stanley was shocked to see the Ford vehicle he believed to have been involved drive off along Northeast Fourth Street.

He then drove his vehicle across three lanes of traffic to follow the car, which eventually stopped several blocks later.

Mr Stanley claims Verdon refused to return to the scene of the accident and denied having been involved, so the part-time handyman took a photograph of her licence plate and returned to the accident site, where ambulance workers had just declared Mr Pirofksky dead.

He was initially unable to get through to officers who were trying to clear traffic, but eventually they listened and took Mr Stanley to a police station for two hours of questioning.

After explaining what he had seen and showing the photograph, Mr Stanley went with officers to Verdon's address where the blue SUV was found covered by a tarpaulin.Â 

The investigators smelt alcohol on Verdon's breath and arrested her the following morning, according to the Sun-Sentinel.

Speaking to the newspaper about why he had followed the vehicle without thinking of his safety, Mr Stanley said: 'I thought, 'You did wrong'. Pay for your crime'

Verdon faces charges of DUI manslaughter, leaving the scene involving death and tampering with evidence, the local Sheriff's Office said, and has been bailed ahead of a trial.
