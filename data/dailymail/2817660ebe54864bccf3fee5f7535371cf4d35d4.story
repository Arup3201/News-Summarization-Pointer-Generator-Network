Reality star Carley Belmonte has told how she lost 10lbs in a week after cruel fans branded her 'a whale.'

The Valleys star was stung by repeated jibes about her weight after she put on two stone filming the hit MTV show.

The abuse peaked at the end of the last series when some viewers took to Twitter to taunt Carley over her figure.

One said: 'You look like you've been blown up like a balloon.'

Carley knew she needed to take action and checked into boot camp for a week of intensive, military style training.

She slimmed down from 10st 12lbs to 10st 2lbs and lost 3.5. inches from her waist (9cms) and 2.5 inches (6.5cm) of fat from around her upper thighs.

Speaking about her weightloss, Carley, 23, said: 'I feel like a new woman and it has taught me so much about staying in shape.

'My lifestyle has completely changed. I've swapped wine for water and biscuits for broccoli.'

She had put on two stone starring in The Valleys because cast members are expected to party all the time during filming and eat fast food at all the wrong times.

Carley said: 'You have got no time to go to the gym and you are eating rubbish all the time.

'I don't like myself when I am watching the show. I am not concentrating on how I am coming over - I'm just looking at the rolls of fat.

'It makes you so self-conscious, especially with all the cruel comments.'

Gruelling: Carley visited No 1 Bootcamp, which has been frequented by Spencer Matthews and Binky Felstead

Tough: Carley said her stay at bootcamp was really hard and involved gruelling military inspired exercises

Hard work: 'I do feel completely different but I don't know how I coped at times. If I had not done some training before I went I think I would have been in trouble,' she said

Carley knew that she needed to take drastic action and she checked into No 1 Boot Camp - the Norfolk fitness camp favoured by Made In Chelsea favourites Binky Felstead and Spencer Matthews, who both lost a stone there.

As Carley prepares to start filming the third series of The Valleys, she is thrilled with the changes in her figure - particularly her thighs which she said are now 'rock solid.'

She said: 'I can't believe the change in my legs. I used to have a bit of cellulite at the back of my thighs but not any more. They look fantastic.

'I do feel completely different but I don't know how I coped at times. If I had not done some training before I went I think I would have been in trouble.

Toning: The reality TV star lost more than 3 inches from her waist and 2.5 inches of fat from her thighs

'I was getting up at 6am every morning and going to bed as early as 8pm because I was so tried. On The Valleys, you stay up all night and sleep during the day.

'It was a complete change in lifestyle and I felt like I was jet-lagged all week.

'It took so much out of me physically and emotionally but it was worth it.'

Carley, from Caerphilly, worked in insurance sales before finding fame on The Valleys.

She has recently been involved in a will-they-won't-they flirty relationship with her co-star Chidgey.

'Nothing has happened so far but who knows what will happen in the new series,' explained Carley.

'We both can't wait to see each other.'
