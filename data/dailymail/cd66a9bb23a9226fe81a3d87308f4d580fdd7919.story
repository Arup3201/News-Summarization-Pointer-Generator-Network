Monaco are interested in bringing Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor back to the club.

Chairman and co-owner Dmitry Rybololev has identified the striker as a summer target despite the fact he is yet to appoint a new manager following Claudio Ranieri's departure.

Target: Emmanuel Adebayor has indicated he wants to stay at Tottenham

Tottenham, however, will not make a decision on Adebayor's future until a new manager has been appointed.

Adebayor, 30, spent three years at Monaco before leaving for Arsenal in 2006.

Interest: Spurs may approach Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti after Saturday's Champions League final

Spurs are waiting until after Saturday's Champions League final to see if there is a chance of luring Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti to White Hart Lane next season.

If not, then chairman Daniel Levy will press ahead with plans to appoint Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino, who has been offered a new three-year-deal to stay at St Mary's.
