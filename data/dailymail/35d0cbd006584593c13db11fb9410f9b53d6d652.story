Queens Park Rangers midfielder Adel Taarabt believes Liverpool will win their first Premier League title if former team-mate Mario Balotelli can form a deadly partnership with Daniel Sturridge.  

Taarabt knows all about Balotelli's qualities having played with the Italian forward during his temporary spell at AC Milan last season. 

And the Moroccan has tipped Balotelli - who he thinks plays in a similar style of play to Zlatan Ibrahimovic - has tipped Liverpool's incoming £16million signing to fire Liverpool to domestic glory.

Public backing: Adel Taarabt believes former team-mate Mario Balotelli has matured into a top striker

Summer arrival: Balotelli, who arrived in England on Friday, will become Liverpool's 10th summer signing

New partnership: Balotelli will be expected to lead Liverpool's line alongside current star Daniel Sturridge

Taarabt, speaking to The Sun on Sunday, said on Balotelli: 'I think he is coming to show he has grown up and that he is mature now. 

'The team is young and, with someone like Steven Gerrard playing with him, he will get his head down and work hard.

'If they get 20 goals from Mario and 20 from Daniel Sturridge, they'll win the league.'

Helping hand: Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, pictured with Balotelli in 2012, may have to guide the Italian

Taarabt believes Liverpool will be signing a completely different player to former striker Luis Suarez.

'He is a different player to Suarez, who is a fantastic player, but his culture is to work hard and chase people. Mario is not like him.

'Mario is more in the style of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. They know they have ability and can win the game. Suarez has that as well so in England he was perfect.' 

Comparison: Balotelli plays in a similar style to PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, according to Taarabt
