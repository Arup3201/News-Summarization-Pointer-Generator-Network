Building of a 574ft (175m) building, dubbed Brighton's Eiffel tower, will begin within weeks - after a lengthy battle to secure funding for the project.

The tower will be erected on the beach in front of King's Road in Brighton, previously home to the historic West Pier,

Instead of standing near water level, visitors to the i360 tower will now need to look 574ft down to see the ocean.

The pier, which was built in 1866 was declared beyond repair in 2004. When construction work is finished in the summer of 2016, a futuristic tower will take its place.

Brighton's answer to the Eiffel Tower will be 574ft (175m) high. It will be built on the beach running parallel to the King's Road in Brighton. The building will replace the former West Pier created in 1866

Planning permission was granted in 2006. Eight years on, following a deal between the Conservative and Green party, Brighton Council has agreed to increase its loan for the project from £14.8 million to £36 million

Despite the fact that the i360 was granted planning permission in 2006, a private backer withdrew funding worth £15 million last year and construction plans ground to a halt

The London-based architects behind the tower, Marks Barfield, also designed the London Eye.
On top of council funding, Marks Barfield will inject £6 million into its construction

The tower will have a capacity for 200 visitors at one time. The visiting dock will look out onto the city from almost 600ft above ground level

The project's website claims that the i360 will follow the same spirit as the West Pier by offering visitors to 'walk on air' in the same way as they were previously invited to 'walk on water'

Despite the fact that the i360 was 
granted planning permission in 2006, a private backer withdrew funding 
worth £15 million last year and construction plans ground to a halt.

Eight years on, following a deal between the Conservative and Green party, Brighton Council has agreed to increase its loan for the project from £14.8 million to £36 million.

The London-based architects behind the tower, Marks Barfield, also designed the London Eye. On top of council funding, Marks Barfieldwill also inject £6 million and a further £4 million will be invested by local enterprise group Coast to Capital.

The total bill for the tower has now soared to £46.2 million.

Green Councillor and Council Leader Jason Kitcat has argued that the loan will be financially beneficial for the city.

He said that the £21 million made in interest payments and fees could be used to repair seafront arches, structures, sea defences and walls.  The structures are currently in need of repair work worth £70 million.

Mr Kitcat said: 'This is a crucial project for revitalising our tourism industry and our seafront for years into the future. It will very clearly signal that our city is open for business - both to visitors and investors.

'This deal will bring in over £1m a 
year additional income to the council whilst also regeneration the local
 area and supporting our tourism economy.

'It
 will provide an extraordinary and spectacular new centrepiece to our 
seafront. As well as providing a great view out, it changes the way the 
world views us - distinguishing Brighton & Hove from competitors and
 signalling that the city is really buzzing.'

But Labour group leader Warren Morgan told the Brighton Argus that the Green party and the Conservatives could be putting tax payers into debt.

He
 told the Brighton paper: 'Next week they will be committing two 
generations of council taxpayers to nearly forty million pounds of debt 
on a project that no private investor will support.'

The tower is expected to welcome 750,000 visitors each year. At one time, the attraction can hold 200 visitors.

If work begins on time, the i360 is expected to open in June 2016.

The West Pier was previously home to a theatre and a concert hall. It attracted two million visitors each year

Fallen glory: Brighton's West Pier was the crown jewel of the city in the 1920s. But over 100 years after it was first built, the pier has been left to fall apart and is now derelict. A 30 year battle was launched to restore the piece of architecture. But in 2004 the campaign ended after English Heritage declared it beyond repair

West Pier was once one of Brighton's most stunning settings. The pier has since fallen into disrepair and been ravaged by two fires. Its spot will soon be taken by the i360 tower

Mods and rockers: Brighton was a fashion capital for mods and rockers in the 1960s. Mods would wear suits and ride scooters while rockers generally wore leather. Pictured here is a group of mods on the Brighton seafront

The West Pier was built in 1866 by naval architect Eugenius Birch. The pier was home to a theatre and a concert hall.

It has been closed since 1975. Since then the pier has been ravaged by two fires and several storms - little of the original pier still stands. It is one of only two Grade I listed piers in the UK, the other being Clevedon Pier.

In its heydey, the West Pier attracted two million visitors a year.

From June 2016 the i360, which will cost more than £46 million will stand in the same spot.

The project's website claims that the i360 will follow the same spirit as the West Pier by offering visitors to 'walk on air' in the same way as they were previously 'walking on water'.

The i360 will also welcome visitors with Victorian tollbooth's to celebrate the pier's history and parts of the same cast iron structure will also be used for the tower's visitor centre.

Although the pier will no longer stand, a proportion of revenue from the i360 will go towards promoting the pier's heritage.
