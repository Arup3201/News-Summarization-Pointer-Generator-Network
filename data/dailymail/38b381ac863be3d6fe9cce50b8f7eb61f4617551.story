An anti-abortion movement appeared to encourage the kidnapping of women bound for abortion clinics before quickly backtracking amid a torrent of complaints.

First posted to Facebook on Abolish Human Abortion’s Facebook page by  ‘Praying for you,’ the message encouraging volunteers to kidnap abortion-ready women went viral and has forced the activist group to distance itself from the comments.

The post encouraged people to volunteer for shuttles meant to take women safely to and from abortion doctors, and to preach to them and drop them off at churches instead of clinics.

Damage control: Abolish Human Abortion scrambled to distance itself from the suggestion, but made sure to sling some mud while doing so

The post asked people to share an email address being used by pro-choice group Cicada Collective for volunteers to sign up as shuttle drivers in Texas.

‘I’m not suggesting you actually take a woman to an abortion clinic,’ the post reads, ‘but it’s a wonderful opportunity to  minister to an abortion-minded woman for an hour while you DON’T take her to her clinic.’

‘Even if you can’t change her mind by the time she gets out of your car and realizes she is at a church and not the clinic, she’s missed her appointment anyway,’ the post continues.

MailOnline was not able to reach the Cicada Collective for comment, the group has not spoken publicly about the online posting.

The shocking suggestion has been sent around the world and back many times by pro-choice groups warning Texans about possible kidnappings.

The @FundTexasWomen twitter account tweeted a screen grab of the post with the caption ‘This really alarmed us this morning, just one reminder that getting an abortion in Texas can be very dangerous.’

The posting has stretched from Facebook and Twitter to Tublr and beyond, the DailyDot noted.One response to a Tublr post showing the inflammatory message suggests that such action could be considered a felony in the Lone Star State.

Very active: AHA routinely protests outside of abortion clinics

The post has been deleted from AHA’s Facebook page, but a screen grab of the message was reposted and received a flood of negative comments.

‘Y'all know this is kidnapping, right?’ Wrote the person who re-posted it. ‘That's a felony, and since it's pre-meditated, have fun in prison.’

The group immediately backed down from the message, but not without a fight.

‘’Yes we deny that we support it. Kidnapping and abortion are wrong for the same reasons, they both violate the inherent rights and dignity of other human beings.’

AHA’s comparison of abortion to kidnapping only further fanned the flames.

‘We just hate you,’ one person responded.

‘ Sorry to hear you're so full of hate,’ the group responded to a negative comment. ‘Not surprising considering you advocate murder. We love you anyway though.’

After a lengthy back and forth during which AHA accused the grab’s poster of slander and libel and even mocked her usage of ‘y’all,’ the poster suggested the group ‘lawyer up and sue’ her.

Peaceful resistance: The group preaches not to incite violence against people on either side of the abortion debate

The group does not appear ready to take her to court, and instead put out an entirely separate post accusing Praying for You of being ‘a fake group created by some pro-abortion rights people who are seeking to create a false story to cast aspersions on anti-abortion activists.’

This did little to stem the negative tide, but once again the group aggressively attacked the intelligence of those against it.

‘The lack of intellectual integrity some of you are demonstrating the last few days is truly astonishing,’ AHA said in a comment. 

The amount of negative publicity and vitriol directed at AHA has failed to prove one thing, any link the group actually has to an organized kidnapping effort.

Texas officials have not reported any abortion-related kidnappings.
