An employee at a popular Philadelphia pub discovered a fetus in the bathroom while he was cleaning the toilets this morning.

The shocking discovery was made about 10am at the Starters Pub in Lower Saucon Township, Philadelphia, when the employee was cleaning the female restrooms.

One of the toilets wouldn't flush properly, so the cleaner opened the tank of the toilet and made the disturbing find.

'Inside the tank was a fetus,' said David Rank, the owner of the pub, appearing visibly shaken.

Rank said it appeared to be a fetus rather than a full-term baby, and police are determining at what stage of gestation it was.

Lower Saucon police and the Northampton County coroner's office were one the scene, and according to District Attorney's office, investigators are treating the disposal of the fetus as a crime.

According to the Morning Call, Lower Saucon police officers will release the gestation stage of the fetus once the coroner's investigation is complete.

Rank told reporters that the restrooms at Starters Pub are cleaned 
every morning, so the fetus must have been placed in the toilet the 
night before.

The pub had a busy Sunday night, with people dining 
and others watching preseason football. Rank said it was impossible to 
know who could have placed the fetus into the toilet.

Police are examining CCTV footage to discover any clues as to the identity of the mother of the fetus.

Rank said his staff were extremely upset by the incident. He allowed 
those who wished to go home, others opted to stay and Rank opened the 
pub to customers at 1pm, two hours later than usual.

'My biggest concern is for my employees, the mother, the baby,' said Rank.

'I just want everyone to say prayers for them.'
