A Maine man charged with disorderly conduct for his loud whistling in downtown Portland has reached a deal with the city - he can whistle, but he can't linger in one spot.

Robert Smith, 32, of Westbrook, has been cited by police twice in the past year after businesses complained.

He pleaded guilty last summer and reached a deal with the city in which he can keep whistling as long as he's moving.

Smith told The Portland Press Herald his whistling – audible a block away – is protected free speech and usually brings smiles. City officials disputed the free speech argument.

Nuisance? Robert Smith the Whistler has found himself in trouble with the law for his persistent and loud tours of Portland, Maine. But he's now allowed to continue as long as he keeps moving

According to the Portland Press Herald, Smith's noisy rounds have divided opinions in the city. The man says he works in construction during the summer, but on days off he heads downtown and stays wandering, and whistling, between 9 am and 5 pm.  

'The Whistler' is a cult figure in the city and Smith appears in blogs, videos and local media. But his unusual habit has got him on the wrong side of the law.

Over the past year he has been summonsed, arrested and taken to court for disorderly conduct.

Trish McAllister, a Portland prosecutor who deals with quality of life issues, told the Herald; 'It just got to the point last summer where the complaints just mounted. He's so loud.'

Portland Downtown District is trying to eradicate bad behavior in the downtown area, and loud whistling qualifies as an offense.

McAllister said: 'The judge and I viewed this as a behavioral issue. (The Whistler) was aggressive. He would follow people who gave him a wrong look.'

'Just like if somebody plays an instrument in front of your business or has the radio on constantly, it's irritating,' PDD Executive Director Janis Beitzer said.

Determined: Smith told police: 'You can arrest me a thousand times, and the day I walk out of this jail, I'll be whistling out the door'

After a business complained, Smith received a summons for disorderly conduct in May 2012 and he was arrested and jailed in July.

On August 22, he pleaded guilty to the charge and according to court documents agreed 'to curb disorderly behavior (loud whistling) in the future.'

The plea agreement includes one important caveat - he is banned from standing still and whistling. As long as Smith remains on the move, authorities have agreed not to stop him.

According to the Herald, Smith said he told police: 'You can arrest me a thousand times, and the day I walk out of this jail, I'll be whistling out the door.'

The Whistler will not be deterred from his habit, claiming his musical habit came from above: 'God is showing me what I'm doing is OK. He shows me every day with laughter.'

Smith says that he likes to make Portland residents happy. 'I'm not out here to be the best whistler in the world. I'm just trying to make people smile,' he said.

'I'm doing it because of the reward it gives me,' The Whistler said. 'My goal is if someday I can walk down the streets of Portland and I can see 20 or 30 people whistling along, doing the same thing I'm doing, well then I will be a happy camper. I'll know I did something right.'

He tried to argue with police that that the First Amendment protects his constitutional rights to free whistling.

'All I'm doing is expressing myself freely,' explained to the Herald. 'People who express themselves freely should be held in the highest regard, not the lowest regard.'

The Whistler does have some support in the community too. He has been featured as an eight-inch model in an artist's window display, as he is a downtown fixture.

And Dr Lisa Belisle, a Portland physician, blogged in 2011 that while she does find Smith 'annoying' he is also a 'placeholder. 'He prompts me to remember that not all hear the same music I hear; or respond the same way,' Belisle added.
