More than a million UK customers of  Net-A-Porter have been left disappointed after the fashion site crashed just hours after launching its end of season sale.

The webpage announced the start of its US sale at around 11am UK time, but just one hour later a message began appearing on the site saying the page was unavailable.

Frustrated browsers began posting on social media, with some complaining they had been booted off the site before being able to pay for the items in their shopping cart.

User Chrissy Rutherford wrote: 'Can the Net-A-Porter sale work yet? I'll cry if I lose my cart.'

Meanwhile Monroe Steele tried to make light of the situation by adding: 'Well the site is down so I guess that's God's way of telling me to keep my money.'

The company's Twitter feed is asking shoppers to send a direct message with their details so the customer service team can contact them, but is not saying how long the issue will take to fix.

Speaking to Mail Online, a Net-A-Porter spokesman blamed high demand for the crash.

Anger: Net-A-Porter has been advising frustrated shoppers to send their details over in a private message on Twitter, but there is no word on how long it will take the site to go back online

Discounts: The crash comes just days ahead of Cyber Monday, the biggest online shopping day of the year, with UK customers expected to spend £649million in 24 hours

The crash comes just days ahead of Cyber Monday on December 1, the biggest online shopping day of the year, with British shoppers making 7.7million purchases worth around £600million in just 24 hours last year.

This year that number is expected to jump significantly as more UK retailers promote heavy discounts, with £649.6million expected to be spent.

Net-A-Porter is a  fashion company that has 6million visitors to its site every month, with just over 1million of those coming from the UK.

The site is also popular in Australia and Hong Kong, and draws customers from other parts of Europe such as Germany and France. 

From one computer in a Chelsea apartment to office blocks in London, New York and Hong Kong: The rise of Net-A-Porter

Natalie Massenet, founder of Net-A-Porter, who sold the business for £350million in 2010

Back in the year 2000, when Natalie Massenet first floated the idea of an online store for high fashion, internet shopping was in its infancy.

Wireless had yet to break into the mainstream, and most people had not yet conceived of a world in which people could shop from their phones, let alone tablet computers.

So when Ms Massenet suggested launching a website selling high fashion labels, she was laughed at, with investors refusing to believe that women would ever use the service.

Despite this, she decided to press ahead with the idea, and set up a webpage linked to a single computer in an apartment she had rented in Chelsea.

Orders came through to Ms Massenet and her team of 15 staff via a painfully slow dial-up connection.

All of the stock was piled at the back of the room, and it was up to this small team to make sure everything was packaged and sent out correctly.

The workload was punishing, made worse by the fact that Ms Massenet was pregnant at the time.

In newspaper interviews since, she has confessed to crying every night during the first year, unable to cope with the pressure.

She needn't have worried. The site was an online shopping revolution, rolling designer boutique and glossy magazine into the one product, and sales took off.

In 2010 Ms Massenet sold the business to luxury group Richemont, whose stable includes luxury brands Cartier and Montblanc, for £350million - pocketing around £50million herself.

At the time, she said: 'There were a lot of unimaginative private-equity people who said that women would never shop online.

'I think about those people a lot. I'm sure their wives are having Net-a-porter bags delivered to their homes every day.'

Today, the website attracts 6million visitors a month from as far afield as the U.S., Hong Kong, Australia, France and Russia.

Of those around 62 per cent buy all of their clothes online, with more than half using a tablet and 48 per cent using a smartphone.

These days Net-A-Porter employs more than 2,000 people in offices from New York to Hong Kong.

Meanwhile Ms Massenet, who is half English and half American, has been named one of the most influential women in fashion.
