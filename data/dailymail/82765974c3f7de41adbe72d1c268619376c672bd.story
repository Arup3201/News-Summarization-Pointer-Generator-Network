Darren Sproles, the star running back for the New Orleans Saints since 2011, isn't happy with the Saint's management after he learned he would be traded through reports on Twitter earlier this week.

His wife, it appears, is equally perturbed.

Sproles' wife, Michel, took to Instagram to lash out against the Saints' front office for the unprofessional manner in which they have treated her husband.

Peeved: both Darren Sproles and his wife, Michel, are upset with how the New Orleans Saints treated the running back in the off-season

Who Dat! Michel Sproles explained that her problem wasn't with Saints fans, but with the team's front office

Michel Sproles' rant - which has since been deleted from her account - is heavy on two things: profanity and God.

'I am so disappointed in the Saints organization & the way they are treating my husband,' she wrote. 'I understand this is a brutal business but when u [sic] have a  good guy who works hard & does a lot for the community u [sic] would think they would show a little more respect.

'To verbalize to him that they will release him so at least he can choose the team he wants to spend his last few years in the NFL on & then take it back without a word & try to trade him is (expletive) upâ€¦

Michel Sproles continued, saying 'I no [sic] I have no control over this & God is gonna work it out but in the mean time Iâ€™m gon [sic] vent & talk (expletive). Lol! WhoDat Nation get ready for a ride because the seeds yall [sic] front office is planting its [sic] not gon [sic] be a good look for yallâ€¦ See the way my God is set up he gets the last say & can get u back better than the Compton Curse out I wanna give these (expletive)!'

Rant: Michel Sproles has since deleted this post from her Instagram account - but not before it found its way into the blogosphere

Philly: Sproles was traded Wednesday to the Philadephia Eagles after three years with New Orleans

The post included several social media hasgtags, including '#YesICurseAndPraiseGod #OnlyGodCanJudgeMe #IputHisChargerPicsUpBecauseTheSaintsAint(Expletive)ForWhatTheyDoin.'

Many Saints fans - members of 'WhoDat Nation' - weren't pleased with what they considered an attack on their city and their team, and fired off several angry responses to Michel Sproles' lengthy Istagram update. 

In a separate post, Michel Sproles attempted to clarify the point she was trying to make.

'I did not attack the Who Dat Nation, I specifically said I was 
referring to the Front Office,' she wrote. 'I think the Who Dat Nation 
is awesome!'

Sproles, who signed a $14 million, four-year deal with the Saints in 2011, was traded Thursday to the Philadelphia Eagles after a bitter split with the Saints.

After she'd cooled off a bit, Michel Sproles said a heartfelt goodbye to the fans her husband has acquired while a member of the Saints.

'I want to send a special thank you to the WhoDat Nation & Everyone that supported my husband through his journey as a Saint,' she wrote. 'We will miss the love in New Orleans & our New Orleans Fam!'

WAG: Sproles isn't the only WAG making headlines in the off-season - Eric Decker's wife, Jessie James Decker, also has made waves on social media

Michel Sproles isn't the only NFL WAG making headlines this week - former Denver Broncos wide receiver Eric Decker's wife nearly spilled the beans on social media about which team her hubby planned to sign with.

While visiting New York - and while Decker was still unsigned - the receiver's wife, country music artist Jessie James Decker posted 'So Excited!!!!!!!' on her Twitter page.

The post started rumors that Decker was planning to sign with the New York Jets - a rumor that turned out to be true.

Jessie James Decker - who currently is pregnant - tried to quell the rumors by saying she was excited about a recent doctors appointment.
