Manchester United players were stuck on their tour bus as crowds surrounded them after their driver was hauled away by police in Shanghai.

The driver was forced off for the bus for police questioning after apparently using the wrong lane on Thursday night.

The bus, clearly touting the team name, was quickly surrounded by hoards of fans wanting a photo of the team.
