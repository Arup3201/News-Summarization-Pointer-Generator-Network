Post Office workers have gone on strike today in a row over jobs, pay and closures - saying they received strong support from the public over their action.

Members of the Communication Workers Union in around 260 so-called Crown offices took industrial action in protest at plans to close or franchise 70 branches.

The union said the walkout was 'solidly' supported by thousands of its members, with picket lines set up outside post offices across the country.

The Post Office said scores of branches were open despite the strike.

The CWU said MPs and local politicians offered their backing to the strikers, adding that members of the public were also showing support.

The union said hundreds of jobs will be affected by the proposals, which it warned would cause further problems for high streets already suffering from shop closures.

The CWU added that staff had not received a pay rise for two years.

The Post Office said Crown branches were losing £40million a year and accused the union of ignoring the 'harsh realities' the company faces.

Dave Ward, the CWU's deputy general secretary, said: 'Our post office members are standing up against destructive plans which would slash 20 per cent of the Crown network and are simply asking for fair treatment and job security.

'The Post Office's plans are short-sighted and would rob the network of the most productive offices while simultaneously putting hundreds of jobs at risk and potentially damaging local economies.

'We'd like to see a better vision for a successful network which maintains services in the heart of communities alongside quality jobs. We're confident this could be achieved if Post Office management would agree to negotiations.'

Kevin Gilliland, Network and Sales Director at the Post Office said: 'We regret any inconvenience caused to customers by today’s strike action.

'However, over 100 of our Crown branches are open today and the remainder of our 11,800 branches are unaffected.

'The CWU is ignoring the harsh commercial realities being faced by the Post Office and other retailers across the UK.

'Crown branches are currently losing £40m per year and this is being subsidised by public money.  This cannot continue.

'The Post Office is transforming its network to improve customer experience and in turn bring in new business.

'We are committed to the Post Office remaining a key part of UK high streets and our plans ensure this will happen.

'This means for 70 of our Crown branches – less than one per  cent of our network – we will be looking to partner with a suitable retailer, whilst at the same time we will invest £70m in the remaining 300 Crown branches to modernise and grow services to ensure their long term viability.

'Our pay offer remains unchanged.  We want to make the first payment of up to £1400 as quickly as possible.  Any future strike action can only cause further inconvenience for customers and delay how quickly this money will be received into our people’s pay packets.'

The union pointed out that Crown offices handle 20 per cent of all Post Office business.
