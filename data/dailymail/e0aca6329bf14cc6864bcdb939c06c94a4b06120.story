Google has vowed to crack down on bloggers who post porn, telling them that their posts will be hidden from view if they don’t clean up their act.

People who publish material on the company’s Blogger platform now have just one month to remove any explicit photographs and videos. 

After March 23, Google will make any offensive accounts ‘private’, effectively making them impossible to view by anyone other than the account holder.

Blogs created after the deadline may also be taken down.

Google used to only ban content that was illegal, or had been published without the consent of the people it featured. 

But it now says explicit photographs will have to be justifiable on ‘artistic, educational, documentary, or scientific grounds’.

Google changed its rules following a Daily Mail campaign to get firms to take more responsibility for the content published on their websites. 

Earlier this month, it emerged that porn actors and publishers are using Twitter to get past family-friendly online filters, putting explicit images within reach of children.

A study found that 500,000 graphic images and videos are published on the site every day, but Twitter has so far refused to address the problem. 

Separately, Reddit said in its updated privacy terms Tuesday it would ban 'involuntary pornography' or 'revenge porn' starting March 10.

According to the company: 'If you believe that someone has submitted, without your permission, to Reddit a link to a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, please contact us... and we will expedite its removal as quickly as possible. Reddit prohibits the posting of such content without consent.'

The move comes after Reddit gained notoriety for hosting forums used to post nude pictures hacked from other online accounts in 2014. That included pictures of celebrities including actress Jennifer Lawrence, pop icon Rihanna and top model Kate Upton.

'Last year, we missed a chance to be a leader in social media when it comes to protecting your privacy.

'No matter who you are, if a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity, sexual excitement, or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, is posted or linked to on Reddit without your permission, it is prohibited on Reddit.'

Reddit was also criticised for allowing users to post pictures of underage girls, before shutting down forums used for that purpose. Reddit three years ago banned child pornography and posting of sexually suggestive material involving minors.
