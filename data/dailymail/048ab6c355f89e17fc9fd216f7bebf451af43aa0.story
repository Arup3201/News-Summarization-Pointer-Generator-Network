Roger Federer will vie for his seventh Gerry Weber Open title on Sunday after cruising into the final for the ninth time in 12 years.

Federer, almost unbeatable in the tournament over the past decade, saw off fourth seed Kei Nishikori in straight sets to reach the final of a competition he's won six times and been runner-up twice in.

His 6-3 7-6 (7-4) in 73 minutes was enough for the second seed to accept his invitation to the final.

Yet again: Roger Federer reached the Gerry Weber Open final for the ninth time in 12 years

Final: It will give Federer a chance to try for his seventh title on Sunday after his straight-sets win

Decade: Federer has proved almost unbeatable at the Gerry Weber Open in the past 10 years

Unlucky: Japan's Kei Nishikori was Federer's latest victim at a tournament he clearly likes

Nishikori, having lost his serve at the start of the second set, rallied back to force a tie-break but the Japanese player couldn't take it to a third and decisive decider.

He edged a mini-break to move 4-2 ahead in the tie-break but Federer, as per, rallied his way back and won the last five points to seal his place in the final.

Alejandro Falla stands in Federer's way of making it a magnificent seven, having beaten home favourite Philipp Kohlschreiber.

Falla, 30, lost the opening set and was a break down in the decider, but the underdog came back on both occasions to claim a 5-7 7-6 (7/5) 6-4 win.
