Ken Hom, 64, intends to donate his global property estate to Action Against Hunger

He taught the British how to love Chinese food and acquired a multi-million pound fortune along the way.

But celebrity chef Ken Hom yesterday revealed he would not be leaving his vast wealth as an inheritance upon his death – it will all go to charity.

The 64-year-old former BBC star has invested in a number of properties around the world and said he now plans to leave his large estate to charity Action Against Hunger admitting because he started with nothing he does not understand why others should not do the same.

Speaking about his finances at the weekend, Mr Hom said: ‘When I die, all my properties will be transferred to Action Against Hunger [which helps malnourished children around the world]. I don’t believe in inheritance.

‘I came into the world with nothing; nobody helped me.

‘One of the greatest things about making money is that I could support my mother. She quit her job at the age of 50 and then lived for another 41 years very comfortably.

‘My father died when I was only eight months old, so my mother brought me up and we were extremely poor.

‘We lived in Chinatown in Chicago and she worked in a factory making tinned Chinese food for the US Army.

‘We lived in two rooms and had to share a toilet with other tenants. I had so little food that I was tested for tapeworms by one school because I was so skinny.’

Motivated by experiences of being poor in his youth, Mr Hom’s first venture into shares was aged just 14 years old while he was working in his uncle’s restaurant washing pots and pans.

He bought his first flat in California, aged 29, later selling it in 1998 for a profit of more than £150,000.

The TV star, 64, does not have children and shot to fame in 1984 in the BBC series Ken Hom’s Chinese Cookery, he has written 20 books which together sold 1.7 million copies.

He has also secured valuable merchandising deal with more than seven million Ken Hom-branded woks sold worldwide and his name on a range of Chinese food at Tesco.

Today the businessman –who turned over more than £40,000 last year from book sales, merchandising deals and consultancy work – owns a flat in Paris worth £500,000 and a renovated 11th century period property in Toulouse. He also has a condominium in Bangkok with a swimming pool.

In an interview with the Sunday Times, the TV cook admitted his most extravagant purchased was his investment in a wine cellar after a good year of book sales.

The contents, which included £12,000 bottles of Louis Roederer Cristal 2000 champange, sold at auction for £130,000 a few years later.

Touching on excessive incomes and the need to donate to charity, Mr Hom said: ‘I would like more incentives for people to give to charity.

‘People don’t need large amounts of money to live on — it’s obscene. Although I am a small fish in comparison, I admire Bill Gates and Warren Buffett for giving away their fortunes.

‘I give away about £30,000 a year to charity. I once donated £23,000 to the mentoring programme at Oxford Brookes University.’

Raised in America Mr Home began cooking as a child, and gave cookery lessons to fund his history of art degree at the University of California.

In 2009 he was appointed an honorary OBE for services to culinary arts. His last TV series, Exploring China: A Culinary Adventure, appeared on BBC2 in 2012.

Mr Hom holds an honorary doctorate at Oxford Brookes University.
