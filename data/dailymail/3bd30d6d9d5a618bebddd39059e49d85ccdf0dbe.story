It is a touching memento of her down-to-earth manner.

Addressed simply ‘To George’, this hand-written Valentine’s Day card from Princess Diana is not quite the romantic mystery it might at first appear, however.

The Daily Mail can reveal that the recipient was none other than George Smith, the royal valet who caused a scandal when he claimed to have been raped by a member of Prince Charles’s household.

Bit of fun: The cute card was specially printed and then signed by Diana, pictured together with its recipient, valet George Smith

In fact, the ex-soldier would have received the cute pink card the same year in which he would later claim the attack took place.

Up for sale for £8,000, it is part of a package of memorabilia sold by Mr Smith’s family after he died penniless.

Diana is believed to have sent similar messages to several favoured servants on cards specially printed in 1989, when she was still married to Charles.

Mr Smith’s card – at least the third to be sold – is advertised as addressed to a servant ‘very closely associated and personally employed for many years as a personal valet to the Princess’.

It is in reality from the collection of a man who also told the Mail on Sunday in 2003 that he witnessed Prince Charles in a compromising position with a servant.

Nice gesture: The front of the card, left, and inside, right, which is personally signed from Princess Diana. It is expected to fetch nearly £8,000 at auction

The former corporal in the Welsh 
Guards was Charles’s valet for nine years until being dismissed in 1997,
 but was regarded by Diana as an ally during their break-up. The 
Falklands veteran suffered from mental health problems and his 
scandalous allegations have always been strenuously denied.

During
 the 2002 trial of former butler Paul Burrell for stealing from Diana’s 
estate, it emerged she had kept a recording of his claims. But the tape 
vanished.

After years of 
alcoholism, Mr Smith died in 2004 aged 45, with his collection of cards 
and notes from Diana passed to his widow, Yvonne, and their two 
children.

They are understood to have sold them to dealer Mark Riddle to fund ‘a new life abroad’.

Mr
 Riddle said the card is ‘part of a few sent by Diana to cheer up 
loveless employees’.

He added: ‘Not many people can ever have been 
handed a Valentine’s card by a princess, let alone one of the most 
iconic. It shows her sense of fun and girlishness.’

Riddle, who owns Memorabilia UK,
 tasked with selling the extremely rare card, added: 'The family of 
George contacted me after his death saying they wanted to sell his 
collection of Diana artefacts.

'I
 was amazed when I saw it, not many people can ever have been handed a 
Valentine’s card by a Princess, let alone one of the most iconic.

'George had a whole host of Diana memorabilia, often signed by her.

'It
 is believed to have been part of a few sent by Diana to cheer up 
loveless employees, but one, however, cannot imagine she gave out too 
many of these.'

The pink card - which measures 18x13cm - comes from the 1989 Andrew Brownsword collection and is called 'Lady Di by Dino...'

Funny: The Valentine's Day card was anonymously sent by Diana in 1989 when she was still married to Prince Charles. However, it was intended as a practical joke and not a romantic gesture

It shows a teddy bear jumping among 
pink hearts and the printed message, 'Hey Valentine! Not Many Men 
Receive a Valentine’s Card From Princess Diana.'

Inside the message concludes, 'And You’re One of Them', and the Princess has written 'to George, from Diana!'

Memorabilia dealer Mr Riddle added: 'You can only imagine the potential worth of this Diana Valentine card in say 100 years time.

'It really shows the Princess’s sense of fun and girlishness.

'Like many rare collectables it is a hard thing to accurately value, but we have currently pricing it at £7,995.

'Hopefully this treasure can be safe-guarded for the next generation to enjoy.'

Only one other similar card has ever been discovered, which was addressed to Sgt Lewis, a former soldier who worked for the Royal family.

At least two similar cards have 
previously been auctioned. One was sold by former royal servant Sergeant
 Ronald Lewis for £2,000 while another written to ex-royal chef Mervyn 
Wycherley fetched £1,200.
