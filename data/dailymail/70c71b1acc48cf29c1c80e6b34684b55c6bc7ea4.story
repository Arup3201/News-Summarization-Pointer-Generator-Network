The BBC's ongoing move to Salford has fuelled a massive property boom in the northern town, with house prices rising four times quicker than elsewhere in the country.

A total of 2,300 BBC staff are expected to have moved to the town just outside Manchester, with many relocating from London.

The average home in Salford is now worth £91,508, up 6.8 per cent on a year ago - the largest price increase in any part of Britain outside the capital.

In England and Wales as a whole, average house prices rose by just 1.7 per cent, to £162,080, according to data released by the Land Registry.

Boom: Salford has seen its property prices rise faster than anywhere else outside London

Despite the runaway growth in Salford house prices, BBC employees who have relocated there are still better off than if they had stayed in London.

Greater London was the only area which had a larger annual increase, as prices rose by 8.4 per cent to £371,223 - four times the average price in Salford.

Elsewhere in the North-West, the average house price fell 3.5 per cent, adding to the evidence that the Salford property market has been buoyed by the arrival of the BBC at the MediaCityUK complex.

Several of the towns which saw the greatest falls in prices are within 30 miles of Salford, such as St Helens, where the average house lost 7.8 per cent of its value, and Oldham and Bolton, where prices fell by 6.3 per cent.

Local estate agent Greg Davies, of Reeds Rains, attributed the success of the Salford property market to the offices which have been set up in the city by the BBC and other media companies.

'With the arrival of the BBC, it's definitely brought renewed interest especially, in Salford Quays - and rents are particularly buoyant,' he said.

Mr Davies added that it was not only media workers themselves who were more keen on the area, saying that because of the new developments, 'People see it as an exciting place to live.'

1) Greater London 8.4% - £371,223

2) Salford 6.8% - £91,508

3) Brighton & Hove 5.3% - £229,004

4) Anglesey 5.1% - £134,328

5) West Berkshire 5% - £232,043

The Corporation announced in 2004 that it planned to move several departments north in order to cut costs and increase regional diversity.

Sport, Radio 5 Live, Breakfast and the BBC Philharmonic are all now based in Salford, as are the children's television channels CBBC and CBeebies.

However, the BBC has been widely criticised for the £1billion cost of the move, as well as the lavish relocation deals offered to senior staff.

Employees living in the South are entitled to claim payments of up to £1,900 a month for two years to subsidise the cost of rented accommodation in Salford.

And Peter Salmon, the senior executive responsible for co-ordinating the move, has not yet bought a permanent home in the North, amidst rumours he could be offered another job which would allow him to keep his family in London.

Some radio and television programmes supposedly based in Salford have recorded many of their editions in London after having difficulty finding guests who are willing to travel to the MediaCityUK studios.

This three-bedroom house on Merchants Quay, less than a mile from the MediaCityUK complex where the BBC offices are located, is on the market with Reeds Rains for £240,000.

The two-floor mews property in the formerly run-down docks area boasts a living room, garage and communal garden.

The street where it is located has seen average house prices rise by more than £5,000 in the past year, according to property website Zoopla.

Its situation is particularly desirable for BBC employees, given the proximity to the Corporation's headquarters and other new developments within walking distance.
