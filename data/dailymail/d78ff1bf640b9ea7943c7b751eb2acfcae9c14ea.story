Loitering by the side of the dusty motorway in a skimpy lilac dress which hung loose from her birdlike body, the girl looked lost and painfully alone in the dark Brazilian night.

It was 1.30am and there was no obvious explanation why she should be on a nightmarish stretch of road rather than asleep in her own bed.

But the deeply disturbing truth was this. At the age of 11, Leliah, with her childlike and fragile limbs, was selling herself for sex to any truck driver prepared to pay.

Trapped in prostitution: Thousands of underage girls who are sold for sex every ten miles along Brazil's 2,7000 BR-116 motorway

‘When he’s finished he throws me out 
of the cab’, she said, showing her battered and bruised elbows. 
‘Sometimes they let me climb down, or sometimes they just kick me out 
onto the concrete.

‘But I never sell myself short. I charge 25 reals (£10) a time’. 

For
British journalist Matt Roper, this chance meeting with Leliah was to 
change his life. He drove off along the BR-116 motorway, a merciless 
2,700-mile stretch of road spearing up the coast of Brazil from Rio de 
Janerio to Fortaleza, in a state of profound shock.

Later he decided to investigate and write about the forgotten children who eke out a living on the Highway to Hell.

And despite being a hardened news reporter, nothing had prepared him for the scale of depravity he was to uncover. 

Abandoned: Lilian, a 12-year-old whose mother abandoned her. Her neighbour forced her to prostitute herself, but she was later stabbed in the neck at a bar and fell pregnant

Left: Mara, 16, left,  performed an abortion on herself after being raped by her landlord and right, Josilene, 15, who would end up miles away from home on the motorway after selling her body

Leliah
was just one of thousands of girls – some as young as nine - sold for 
sex every ten miles along the BR-116. Many are prostituted by their own 
families. The cheapest fee for a transaction is £8.

'I
was expecting to find something alarming, something that would make a 
shocking investigative story, but never this,' Roper said.

'I’d stumbled
upon what appeared to be an epidemic of child prostitution, involving 
thousands of young, innocent girls.

'Every
story I heard was more distressing than the last and the girls were all
so vulnerable, completely alone and unprotected. It broke my heart.

'I
later discovered a hushed-up Brazilian government report into the 
motorway, which had identified 262 places along the motorway where 
children were known to be sold for sex – that’s one, on average, every 
ten miles.

With the help of children’s councillor Rita Marques, who is based in the town of Medina, Roper began to meet the girls whose lives were blighted before they had even reached adulthood

“I couldn’t understand how this tragedy had been kept hidden, unreported, for so long.”

With
the help of children’s councillor Rita Marques, who is based in the 
town of Medina, Roper began to meet the girls whose lives were blighted 
before they had even reached adulthood.

One of the most horrific cases involved a 16-year-old called Mara, who lived with her mother and two brothers in Serrinha.  

At
the age of 11, their landlord Jonas began to sell her for sex because 
he gave the young girl food when her mother went to work.

He
also raped her and she fell eventually pregnant. Jonas forced her to 
carry out a horrific abortion using a coat hanger, leaving her bleeding 
and distraught. 

She turned to drugs and is now being pimped out by 
local gangsters.

And then 
there was Mariana. At 13, she was forced to sell her body on the 
motorway by her own mother Maria. Sometimes her parent would even walk 
her to the road, negotiate her price and then greedily snatch away the 
money for cigarettes. 

If Mariana failed to attract a customer, she 
would face a beating when she returned home.

Safe haven: Determined to help the girls Roper set up a charity in the UK called Meninadança. With the funds raised the charity decided to create a safe space for the girls and now rent a building known by locals as the Pink House

Inspiring: The wall of the Pink House's dance class which reads: 'Don't be the girl who fell. Be the girl who got on her feet again'

Hope: Run by Ms Marques, nearly 100 girls aged 11 to 17 have been through its doors since it opened at the beginning of the year, with around 60 coming to the project every day

Brazil’s
relaxed attitude to buying sex has long attracted international 
criticism - UNICEF estimates there are 250,000 children into 
prostitution across the country.

And
as Brazil prepares to host the next World Cup and Olympics 2016, the 
South American nation is under the pressure to break the growing problem
of child prostitution racket.

Brazilian
law dictates that an adult subjecting a child to prostitution or sexual
exploitation is punishable by imprisonment for four to ten years and a 
fine, but countless times Roper came across young girls who told him 
their abuser had not been punished.

He
even went on a raid with local police to track down girls being abused 
in motels, although was disheartened by what he saw – police gave motel 
owners enough time to warn their customers as well as giving up if 
punters did not answer the door after a 10-minute wait.

Roper had moved to Brazil with his wife Dani, 26, and their son Milo, three, in November 2011.

He had always intended to write about the girls, but now he decided that he would also set up a charity to help them.

Message: Girls who spend time at The Pink House paint a mural on the wall in their local community

Working
with his friend Canadian country singer Dean Brody who had been with 
him on the night he met Leliah, Roper set up a charity called to Meninadança provide refuge for the children who had been forced into 
prostitution. 

They established The Pink House in Medina, where visitors
can talk about their experiences, take dance and beauty classes and 
find support.

Run by Ms 
Marques, nearly 100 girls aged 11 to 17 have been through its doors 
since it opened at the beginning of the year, with around 60 coming to 
the project every day.

Meanwhile,
Roper had had a second encounter with the young girl who was 
prostituting herself so her mother could afford cigarettes.

Now she was 15, seven months pregnant and dancing for a scruffy, unshaven man in a brothel.

‘My
mum never cared about me. She was just interested in using me to buy 
her cahaca. So I ran away. At least now I can keep the money for 
myself’, she told him.

Road of misery: Brazil's BR-116 motorway also known as the 'highway to hell' by the girls who sexually abused every day

With 
the help of Ms Marques, Roper persuaded Mariana that she did not have to
stay in this sordid place. After persuading the town’s judge to 
forcibly take her away from the mother who was exploiting her, the 
journalist and his wife took her in and, despite being unable to keep 
her baby, she has now settled into their home.

Her 16th birthday was celebrated with a huge party.  

 ‘I
wept as I saw her, beaming radiant, surrounded by new friends and 
family. I could hardly believe she was the same girl we had found less 
than a year ago, dancing lifelessly inside that dark oppressive roadside
brothel,’ Roper said.

Later,
Roper and his wife took another girl into their home who workers at the
Pink House had discovered was in danger. Nathane, 13, was sleeping in 
friends’ houses after her mother died, and was on the brink of falling 
into the dark work of child prostitution that had snared so many.

Despite successes with Mariana and the Pink House, there was one girl that Roper could not forget.

Haunted by Leilah, the ghostly girl in the lilac dress, the journalist set out to find her.

It
was too late. Still a prostitute on the Highway To Hell, she was now 
heavily addicted to crack cocaine and desperate for cash to buy drugs.

When Roper refused, she became furious and snarled: ‘Don’t bother coming back.’
