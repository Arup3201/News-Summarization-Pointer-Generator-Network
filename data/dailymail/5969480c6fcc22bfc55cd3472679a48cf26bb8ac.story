Supermarkets have become one-stop shops for eight million consumers, who buy everything from baked beans to barbecues, according to research.

They are being encouraged to purchase all their non-food items from supermarkets, as well as the weekly grocery shop, by convenience, cost and rewards such as loyalty points, a study found.

The findings reveal that 98 per cent of Britons buy at least some non-food items – such as clothes or electronics – from supermarkets.

Convenient: Eight million consumers buy everything they need from supermarkets

And six in ten shoppers would be happy to buy big-ticket items such as a holiday or TV from a supermarket if the price was competitive.

Nearly three quarters (72 per cent) of Britons have bought clothing and accessories from  a supermarket retailer, rising to 78 per cent among women.

CDs, DVDs and video games were the second most common non-food purchase, followed by household electrical appliances, toys, gardening equipment and DIY tools and mobile phone or computing devices.

The survey of 2,000 people was commissioned by finance giant Santander. 

Spokesman Alan Mathewson said: ‘Cost, rewards and convenience are a major incentive for shoppers at a time when households are increasingly short of money and time. 

‘While independent retailers continue to offer a more traditional high street experience, competitive pricing and generous rewards mean many consumers are looking to consolidate their purchasing habits under just one roof.’
