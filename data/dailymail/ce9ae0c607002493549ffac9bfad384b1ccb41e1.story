ITV has been caught up in a fakery row after actor Michael Le Vell appeared in Coronation Street’s official cast photograph - even though he was not there for the shoot.

Bosses released a new picture yesterday with the cast posing in the sun outside the Rovers Return.

But the image also features 49-year-old Mr Le Vell, even though he was in rehab at the time and did not attend the photo session.

Where's Michael? The official Coronation Street cast picture featured actor Michael Le Vell - even though he was not there for the photo session. Instead, an image of him was inserted afterwards, as shown in the enlarged image, top left

It has emerged that an individual picture of the actor, who plays Kevin Webster, was inserted afterwards between his co-stars Bruno Langley and Sue Cleaver.

An insider at the long-running soap told the Daily Star that show organisers were not trying to deceive viewers as they had never stated Mr Le Vell was there on the day.

The source said: ‘Michael had genuine health reasons for not being there on the day but that doesn’t mean he should be permanently excluded from the cast photo.

‘He’s taking time out of the show to sort out his personal issues but he’s very much part of the Corrie family.

‘The
 decision was taken to slip in a shot of him at a later date and I 
highly doubt whether most people would have even noticed he wasn’t there
 for real.’

A professional photographer is said to have taken a picture of the star on his own and in the same position he would have been standing in if he had been at the official photo shoot.

Last month it was reported that Mr Le Vell had checked himself out of rehab at The Priory in Greater Manchester after going three weeks without a drink.

Le Vell attended the clinic after he admitted in the Sunday Mirror that he used cocaine to cope with stress during his trial in September when he was cleared of child sex abuse charges.

Earlier this month, he made his directional debut on the popular soap, taking control of filming on set

The star is not due to return to play mechanic Kevin Webster until September.
