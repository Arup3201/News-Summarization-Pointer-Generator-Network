Your Secret Santa may have had an additional secret while making their online purchase.

A new survey has revealed that approximately 16 per cent of online holiday shopping in the U.S. is conducted from a toilet.

More than 38 million Americans, with men found more likely than women, are accused of the clandestine multitasking according to calculations based on 2,104 online adults surveyed in November.

'Smartphones and tablets have enabled 
consumers to shop and gift on-the-go in more ways and places than ever 
before,' said David Stone, co-founder and CEO of CashStar which 
conducted the survey.

But in addition to toilet shopping, the survey found several other surprising locations.

Nearly 17 million shoppers, or seven per cent, are said to purchase products off their mobile device while physically standing inside the retailer's store.

More than four million Americans, or 1.6 per cent, were found admitting to making purchases while behind the wheel of a vehicle while also more than nine million, or 3.7 per cent, said they secretly shopped during business meetings.

The grocery store was also found a popular spot for online shopping with more than seven million, or 2.9 per cent, of Americans said to be making dual purchases off their mobile devices.

CashStar’s estimations supplied by Harris Interactive are based on the more than 200 million adults above the age of 18 residing in the U.S. according to the Census Bureau’s 2011 report.

Harris says they specialize in delivering research solutions that help stay ahead of what’s next.
