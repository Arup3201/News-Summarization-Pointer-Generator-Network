Diana Nyad, the American woman who became the first person to swim the 103 miles from Cuba to Florida on Monday, has described how she pushed through excruciating pain to achieve her life-long dream.

The 64-year-old said sheer determination and the experience of her age helped her overcome jellyfish, sea sickness and extreme fatigue to finish the grueling swim in 52 hours, 54 minutes and 18.6 seconds. It was her fifth attempt at the swim, which she completed without a shark cage.

'When I finally got to the destination, I was euphoric,' said Nyad, whose mouth was swollen from a mask she wore to protect her face from deadly jellyfish, as she appeared on GMA on Tuesday.

But the record-breaking feat came after hours of struggle.

'With all the experience I have, I didn't realize how much suffering there was going to be,' she said.

'The wind was huge, the jellyfish mask made me take in a lot of water, I was sick as a dog. I was vomiting constantly almost throughout the 53 hours. You don't have strength anymore. So I wasn't just out there daydreaming, I was dealing with a crisis,' she told Kate Bolduan on CNN's New Day.

Usually during an hours-long swim 'you're singing Neil Young songs to yourself, counting French and German and Spanish to yourself,' she told New Day. 'But when you're suffering - with the mask, with the salt water - now you're not thinking of anything, you're just coping and surviving.'

She also battled through the loneliness of the 53-hour swim.

'It's a very isolating experience even though I have 35 people around me,' she said.

But despite the pain, she followed her mantra - 'Never give up' - to reach the shore.

'Never give up': Diana Nyad emerges from the Atlantic Ocean after completing a 110-mile swim from Cuba to Key West, Florida

When I'm 64! Diana Nyad entered the history books on Monday after completing the 103-mile swim from Cuba to Key West in Florida. She said she felt 'euphoric' when she finally stepped on to the shore

'It's
amazing how the emotional can lift the physical,' she told the Today 
show. 'To see those people and to make it in with my intrepid crew, it 
just takes all the physical pain away.'

Ms Nyad also explained that she was able to complete the stretch this time because conditions were on her side.

Not
only was she better prepared with advice from the world's top jellyfish
expert, but the Gulf Stream was also moving north towards her 
destination.

'This time I got lucky,' she told CNN. 'The gulf stream was my friend and usually it's not.'

She also said that her age - 64 - was largely responsible for her achieving the feat she first attempted in her 20s.

'I really do believe that endurance grows and we can never discount the mental,' she told GMA. 'The power of concentration and the perspective of what it all means and what you're capable of are infinitely higher at this age than when you're a young 20-something.'

When they saw the lights of Key West in the night, she knew they were going to make it.

At
that point, 'I had 15 hours to think about the journey,' she told GMA. 
'The destination was always my vision of the palm trees and the shore. 
But the journey - that journey was thrilling. The discovery, the people,
the looking inside at yourself.

'And when you finally get to the destination - I was euphoric.'

Looking
dazed and sunburned, Ms Nyad walked on to the Key West shore on Monday,
becoming the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida without the help
of a shark cage.

As she 
approached, spectators surrounded her in the shallow waters, taking 
pictures and cheering her on as she limped on to Smathers Beach.

Once on the beach, she was put on a stretcher and received medical treatment, including an IV. Her lips were swollen.

It was Nyad's fifth try to complete the approximately 110-mile swim. She tried three times in 2011 and 2012. She had also tried in 1978.

Nyad tweeted today: 'I got 3 messages: 1 is we should #NeverEverGiveUp , 2 is #NeverTooOld to chase dreams , 3 is #NeverASolitarySport it's a team.'

Congratulatory messages began to pour in from around the world for the 64-year-old grandmother. 

President Obama tweeted: 'Congratulations to @DianaNyad. Never give up on your dreams.'

The 64-year-old's last attempt was cut short amid boat trouble, storms, unfavorable currents and jellyfish stings that left her face puffy and swollen.

This time she wore a full bodysuit, gloves, booties and a mask at night, when jellyfish rise to the surface. Before the swim, she said the kit would slow her down, but she believed it would be effective.

Nyad later told supporters the silicone mask caused bruises inside
her mouth, making it difficult for her to talk.

The
support team accompanying her had equipment that generated a faint 
electrical field around her, which was designed to keep sharks at bay.

A boat also dragged a line in the water to help keep her on course.

The swimmer paused on Monday to 
give a statement of thanks to her team before embarking on the final two
miles of the grueling feat.

Ms Nyad said: 'This
is a lifelong dream of mine and I'm very very glad to be with you. Some
on the team are the most intimate friends of my life and some of you 
I've just met.'

Secret weapon: This was Nyad's first attempt using the prosthetic face mask custom-made to shield her from the paralyzing stings of the box jellyfish. She said it would slow her down but it was effective

Has it made a difference? The mask was custom made by prosthetics maker Stefan Knauss to shield her entire face from the jellyfish. Last time she only wore panty hose and still got stung

'But I'll 
tell you something, you're a special group. You pulled through; you are 
pros and have a great heart. So let's get going so we can have a 
whopping party.

'Thank you, all of you, thank you for your generosity.'

Nyad's journey began on Saturday morning
when she jumped from the seawall of the Hemingway Marina into the warm 
waters off Havana. She stopped from time to time for nourishment.

The swimmer's support team included kayakers, shark divers and five boats with crews.

She took regular breaks 
to eat smoothies, peanut butter sandwiches and pasta, but remained in the water and wasn't allowed to touch the side
of the boat.
