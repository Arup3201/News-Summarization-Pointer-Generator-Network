It is a costly business looking good and staying up to date with the latest fashion.

But growing numbers of women are taking matters into their own hands, resorting to a new trend of buying clothes, wearing them - then taking them back for a refund.

Indeed one in six admit to ‘wardrobing’ – with more than one in ten confessing that it’s a regular habit.

Weddings, job interviews and black-tie events are the occasions most likely to make a woman consider what is known in America as 'return fraud'.

The money-saving scam is most often done with expensive clothing - hence the name - but the practice is also common with tools, electronics, and even computers.

One in seven women, 14 per cent, explain they buy and return clothes so they have the chance to wear the latest trends just once, and the same number claim when they want to impress they don’t think twice about the price of an outfit, knowing they can get a refund.  

The process is not for the risk-adverse with snags and spillages holding the potential to spoil a well laid refund plan.

However, the most experienced ‘Wardrobers’ have plenty of tricks up their sleeves to avoid awkward questions at the till. 

Nine per cent of women surveyed seek out clothes that have a safety pin tag – which means the label can be removed and replaced.

And one in twenty spray the item with air freshener before returning it.

Anita Naik, consumer editor at VoucherCodes.co.uk, who conducted the research, said: ‘Our research reveals that over a quarter of women who admit to ‘wardrobing’ feel guilty about it, but the pressure to look good on special occasions makes it feel like the only option for some to look good on a budget.’ 

The survey also revealed that those who earn a living in the entertainment industry are the most prolific ‘Wardrobers’ with over a third, 39 per cent, admitting to it. 

On the other hand, teachers are the most honest in their shopping habits with only 10per cent having returned a worn item.  

Women of Worcester are the worst ‘wardrobing’ culprits with a third admitting they have tricked local stores this way, whereas ladies of Leicester are the least likely to do it.

Department stores in the US have created a new technique to help combat return fraud.  

American upmarket fashion chain, Bloomingdale's now puts unsightly black tags on the front of garments that cost over $150, and the company won't accept your return without them.

It is thought the scam, which stores say is no worse than stealing, is a product of our ‘fast-fashion culture’, where trends are popular for a short time then become outdated and therefore worthless.
