Victim: Susan Cox, 46, suffered spinal injuries after being hit by a 55lb sack of rice dropped by a prisoner

A prison cook is set to receive more than £100,000 in compensation from the taxpayer after an inmate dropped a bag of rice on her back.

Catering manager Susan Cox, 46, suffered spinal injuries after being hit by a 55lb sack of rice that was accidentally dropped by an unnamed inmate at Swansea Prison in September 2007.

The mother-of-one, from Ammanford in Carmarthenshire, sued the Ministry of Justice for a six-figure sum for failing to keep her safe at work, and now seems set to receive a heavy payout after a top judge ruled prison bosses were ultimately responsible for her injuries.

Prison officials claimed the accident was not their fault, blaming the 'disobedient and foolish' inmate for dropping the bag of rice.

But Lord Justice McCombe has now ruled that staff were ultimately responsible as the inmate was paid to work in the prison kitchens - even if it was only £11.55 a month.

The judge said: 'The Ministry of Justice took the benefit of this work and I can see no reason why it should not take its burden.'

'The work was clearly done on the Ministry's behalf and for its benefit,' he added.

Mrs Cox had worked at Category B Swansea Prison, which houses 400 prisoners, for more than 10 years when she was injured following a series of blunders.

A court heard how she was supervising a team of six prisoners as they carried food from a delivery van to the jail's first floor kitchen.

One inmate was trapped in a lift while another managed to spill a sack of rice all over the floor.

Mrs Cook ordered the inmates to stop working while she helped clean up the mess.

But she felt a heavy thud on her upper back when a prisoner accidentally dropped the bag on her.

Lord McCombe said: 'What had happened was another prisoner ignored her instructions to stop work and had attempted to carry two sacks past her as she knelt.'

'But he lost his balance and hit his head on an adjacent wall, one of the sacks he was carrying then fell off his shoulder onto her back,' he added.

Mrs Cox suffered agonising spinal pain after the accident which left her unable to work.

She subsequently started a claim against the Ministry of Justice for 'very large' damages after being forced to stop working.

To blame: Lord Justice McCombe has ruled that staff at Swansea Prison were ultimately responsible for Mrs Cook's injuries as the inmate who dropped the bag of rice was being paid to work in the prison kitchens

Her barrister Robert O'Leary said: 'The ministry should pay for the prisoner's negligence.'

'Its relationship to him was materially similar to that of employer and employee', he added.

He also told Swansea County Court that prison bosses had failed to ensure the inmate was trained in manual handling.

The county court judge rejected her claim and said the accident happened because of the inmate's own negligent actions.

But Mrs Cox appealed against the ruling and won her case.

Lord McCombe, sitting with Lord Justice Beatson and Lady Justice Sharp at the Court of Appeal, backed her claim for compensation.

They ruled that because the prison service paid the inmate for his work they were 'vicariously liable' for his actions in the same way as any other prison employee.

Mrs Cox is now entitled to full compensation for her injuries and the exact amount of her award will be decided at a later date. She declined to comment after the case.
