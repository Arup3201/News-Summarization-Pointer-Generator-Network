A dentist has been struck off for offering to perform female genital mutilation on two young girls.

Somali-born Omar Addow is the first practitioner to be struck off by the General Dental Council for offering the illegal procedure in more than a decade.

The 56-year-old was allegedly recorded saying he would carry out the crime, which carries a 14-year prison sentence, in a Birmingham dental practice last year.

The General Dental Council (whose London offices are pictured) ruled Omar Addow intended to perform the illegal operation on two young girls

A hearing last month found Addow guilty of offering the operation, reportedly telling an undercover journalist: 'I will do it for you. Between you, me and Allah only.'  

The hearing ruled Addow performed an internal examination of the woman in his dental practice, before showing her medical instruments used to perform female circumcision.

Former model and women's rights campaigner Waris Dirie has accused authorities of not doing enough to stop female genital mutilation

It was reported the woman asked him if he would carry out genital mutilation on her two nieces, aged 10 and 13.

In its judgment the GDC ruled: 'At the time he made the offer, Mr Addow intended to carry out the procedure, namely female circumcision, at some point in the future'.

Following the publication of an article last year which accused him of the crime, Addow was arrested but later released. 

The 56-year-old was not present last month's hearing after reportedly returning to Somalia to work.

As many as 100,000 women living in Britain are estimated to have undergone female genital mutilation, which is common in parts of Africa and in the Middle East.

Earlier this year Somali-born feminist Ayaan Hirsi Ali warned of the dangers of young girls being taken abroad during school holidays to have the operation performed.

Ms Ali and other campaigners, including former model, Waris Dirie who underwent the procedure herself, have accused authorities of not doing enough to stop FGM being carried out. 

A helpline which was set up by the NSPCC in June has referred 34 potential cases of female circumcision to police.

Officers have carried out two undercover investigations relating to FGM in the past two years, but neither has resulted in prosecution due to an apparent lack of evidence. 

A spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers on FGM told the Sunday Times: 'We are investigating a case in which we have evidence that would indicate that an offence has taken place.

'It's a live investigation and we still have some way to go.'

Recent figures revealed 2,100 victims of female circumcision have been treated in London hospitals since 2010.

There are an estimated 66,000 survivors in the UK, with over 20,000 girls thought to be at risk.
