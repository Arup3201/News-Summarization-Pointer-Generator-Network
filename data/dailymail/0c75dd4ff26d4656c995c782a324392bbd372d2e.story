Typical. You wait two months for a train and then they all come along when the Prime Minister shows up.

But yesterday, after a £35million rescue mission and a remarkable feat of emergency engineering, David Cameron and the south west of England gave a collective cheer for the Orange Army that got the railway running through poor old Dawlish again.

In an extraordinary spectacle, the Prime Minister and a battalion of hi-viz jacketed rail workers united in the Devon seaside town to celebrate the reopening of a line that was devastated in the February storms.

Back on track: The Dawlish railway line reopened this morning after being destroyed in floods earlier in the year. In just two months, the sea wall was significantly strengthened and the track itself completely rebuilt

'Orange Army': David Cameron praised the uniformed Network Rail engineers that rebuilt the 'vital' service. Describing them as the 'Orange Army', the Prime Minister called on the gathered crowd to give them three cheers

Open for business: On Twitter David Cameron said it was 'great to meet the Orange Army'. Earlier he described the south west as 'a wonderful part of the country'

Visiting the reopened railway line this morning, the Prime Minister said: 'This is a great day for the hard-working people of Dawlish, and for businesses and commuters across the South West whose lives have been turned upside down by the devastating loss of their train line'

Repair: The track running through Dawlish in Devon was badly damaged by storms in February. The stretch of track (pictured this morning) has finally reopened, with the first trains travelling through the station shortly after 6am

Damage: The track through Dawlish was swept away along with part of the sea wall (pictured) in early February, completely cutting off the mainline railway service for almost two months

Weather: The coast-hugging railway line was closed on February 5 when winter storms that devastated large areas of south west England led to huge waves battering the Dawlish seaboard and destroying the sea wall

Fixed: Thanks to 'heroic' work by a team of engineers - including dramatically reinforcing the sea wall (pictured) - the line has now opened at a total cost of £35million

Arrivals: Visiting the reopened railway line this morning, Prime Minister described the reopening of the Dawlish railway as 'a great day'

David
 Cameron said 'the impact of the extreme weather shows the importance of
 making our railways strong enough to weather any storm'

Humour: David Cameron laughs at a T-shirt worn by one of the Network Rail workers. The shirt reads: 'The Orange Army came to the Dawlish rescue'

Joy: Town Crier Steve Cunliffe and his wife Caroline celebrate the reopening of the Dawlish railway line during a visit by Prime Minister David Cameron

A 
300-strong Network Rail team toiled night and day in what Mr Cameron 
called a ‘Herculean effort’ to restore the track and rebuild the station
 after crashing waves left rails suspended in mid-air along part of the 
coast-hugging line.

In
 tones more suited to announcing a general election victory than the 
reopening of a railway, he hailed it as ‘a great day’ and called for 
three cheers for the Orange Army.

And so, yesterday, the first passenger train in 58 days was able to trundle once again along the picturesque route.

The
 5.34 from Exeter to Paignton was followed by a succession of trains 
that finally allowed the West Country to be reunited with the rest of 
the nation by rail.

David Cameron declared the south west of England 'open for business' again as he visited the reopened railway line this morning

Stop: The Prime Minister said it was 'vital' to have the railway line that travels through Dawlish reopened. He added that south west England was once again 'open for business'

Celebration: Sticks of rock (left) celebrating the reopening of the railway line were handed out by Network Rail staff at Dawlish railway station. Prime Minister David Cameron (right) described the workers as 'The Orange Army'

Shared: Cameron later took to his Twitter page to share photographs of his visit to Dawlish. He posted an image of himself posing with locals and uniformed railway engineers, with a caption reading: 'Great to meet the 'Orange Army', and mark the re-opening of the vital Dawlish railway line after the storms'

The 
coast-hugging railway line was destroyed on February 5 when winter 
storms that devastated large areas of south west England led to huge 
waves battering the Dawlish seaboard.

The waters eventually punched a hole in the sea wall, washing away large areas of railway line.

In places the track was so badly damaged that it was left standing upright in the air. 

Visiting the reopened railway line this morning, the Prime Minister 
said: 'This is a great day for the hard-working people of Dawlish, and 
for businesses and commuters across the South West whose lives have been
 turned upside down by the devastating loss of their train line.'

'Back
 in February when I visited the town to see the damage for myself, I 
promised to do everything I could to get this vital artery back up and 
running as quickly as possible. I am delighted to say that promise has 
been delivered today,' he added.

'The impact of the extreme 
weather shows the importance of making our railways strong enough to 
weather any storm,' Mr Cameron went on to say.

Later Mr Cameron took to his Twitter page to share photographs of his visit to Dawlish.

He posted an image of himself chatting with workmen, with the caption: 'Everyone here is incredibly grateful to all those who worked so hard to get the South West open for business again.'

Another showed him posing with uniformed railway engineers, and had a caption reading: 'Great to meet the 'Orange Army', and mark the re-opening of the vital Dawlish railway line after the storms.'

Washed away: The first hole in the sea wall appeared on February 5. A second severe storm on the night of February 14 led to another breach, and hampered ongoing repair work

Work to repair the track started 
within a week of the initial storm, but was hampered by another severe storm on the night of 
February 14 which led to another breach in the sea wall.

Then, on March 4 engineers discovered 
25,000 tonnes of a cliff face near Teignmouth just south of Dawlish had 
sheared away above the line.

It resulted in water jets being used to pummel the cliff face to create a controlled landslide.

Contractors created new 11.5 foot deep concrete foundations into the breach in the sea wall before the track was re-laid.

In total, £15million was spent repairing the area outside Dawlish station where track had been left dangling, with an an additional £20million spent repairing tracks either side of the town.

Andy Crowley, from contractor Amco, 
said: 'The amount of concrete that's gone in there, that will be there 
for at least 200 years, beyond a shadow of a doubt.'

Julian Burnell, from Network Rail, said the repair of the breach was 'very, very solid'.

Destroyed: The famous Dawlish railway line was terribly damaged during the dramatic storms in February

Moving forward: Contractors created new 11.5 foot deep concrete foundations into the breach in the sea wall before the track was re-laid

Cost: £15million was spent repairing the area outside Dawlish station, with an an additional £20million spent repairing tracks either side of the town

'Heroes': Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne said: 'Our army of engineers has done an amazing job of putting back together a railway that was ravaged by the elements'

Looking  good: On March 4 engineers discovered 25,000 tonnes of a cliff face near Teignmouth just south of Dawlish had sheared away above the line

Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne said: 'Our army of engineers has done an amazing job of putting back together a railway that was ravaged by the elements.

'They have overcome every obstacle thrown at them, winning many battles along the way to restore this critical piece of the network, ahead of schedule, and in time for the Easter holidays.'

He thanked 'hugely supportive and patient' local communities and businesses.

Network Rail is now looking at creating a new inland route as a back-up to the Dawlish line.

The reopening was welcomed in Cornwall too.

Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne said the engineers have overcome every obstacle thrown at them, 'winning many battles along the way to restore this critical piece of the network, ahead of schedule'

Great timing: The railway line reopened just in time for the Easter holidays when tourists traditionally flock to south west England

Cornwall Council Leader John Pollard said: 'It is excellent news that the rail line has re-opened much earlier than originally predicted and I would like to pay tribute to the hard work of Network Rail in achieving this.'

'Over the past two months everyone has worked together to keep Cornwall connected, with staff from First Great Western and Cross Country Trains ensuring that transport services were maintained while the rain line was shut.'

'It is not acceptable for the main rail link to be shut for long periods of time and we look forward to seeing this commitment from the Government.'
