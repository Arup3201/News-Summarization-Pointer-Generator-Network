Abuse of trust: Geoffrey Oldham stole more than £44,000 from members of a Cheshire credit union to fund holidays in Spain and Wales

A trusted director of a credit union has been jailed after admitting stealing more than £44,000 of savings from the elderly and poor to fund holidays in Spain.

Geoffrey Oldham, 62, set up false accounts to siphon off money from members of the Warrington North East Credit Union in Cheshire.

But he was caught out after member Alice Regan died and her son discovered more than half of her her £8,000 savings was missing.

An investigation then uncovered a fraud that had been running for more than five years.

Many of the credit union's 2,000 members considered Oldham a friend.

The organisation allows people to pay in savings and take out small loans at low risk.

They are often the only safe way for poorer people to borrow money and many pensioners prefer them to banks.

Warrington Crown Court heard how Oldham, a father-of-four,
abused his senior position at the branch on Cinnamon Lane in Padgate to
rip off members and used the money to fund holidays in Spain and Wales.

Recorder
David Williams said he had 'tarnished' the Credit Union's reputation 
and sentenced him to 12 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to 
fraud.

He said: 'For a short time, the name of the company will be tarnished when it becomes known someone of your position did this.

'You used customer accounts to get money for yourself. The court finds it unfortunate to send a man of your age to prison. Your job will go. Your name will go.'

The WNECU is an organisation with 2,000 members.

Oldham, of Bentfield Court, Padgate, Warrington, had been director and vice chairman of the union since 2002 and was responsible for writing cheques, arranging loans and collecting money.

Shock: Members of the Warrington North East Credit Union said they had trusted Oldham and many considered him a friend

He 'professionally planned' the fraud between January 2007 and January 2012, stealing £44,491 from customers.

Rob Jones, prosecuting, said he set up 30 false accounts using their names, and then wrote cheques to himself and pocketed the cash.

Hannah Brookfield, defending, said the grandfather was saddled with debts for credit cards and clothes magazines following a divorce.

'There is no suggestion this is a gentleman who lives a luxurious lifestyle,' she said.

'He had a moral obligation to pay off those debts and now accepts he went about it in a wholly wrong way.'

The court heard that all of the money stolen was covered by a Credit Union insurance policy and returned to members.

Following the hearing, Sandra Bradshaw, chairman of Warrington North East Credit Union, said colleagues were left in 'shock' by Oldham's scam.

She said: 'It was a real shock.

'We truly trust all of our directors and he was well-liked by members. It is a betrayal of trust.

'There was no way we would've found out because of the way he did it.

'We have now made sure that nobody is in the position to be able to do anything like that again.

'I'd like to reassure all members that the fraud was covered by our insurance. We have reviewed all of our policies to ensure that it cannot happen again.'
