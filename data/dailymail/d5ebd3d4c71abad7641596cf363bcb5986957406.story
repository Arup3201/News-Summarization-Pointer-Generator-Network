A dramatic video has revealed how domestic violence rises by more than a third when England are knocked out of the World Cup.

The clip, which shows a woman anxiously watching a football match on TV, claims domestic abuse increases 38 per cent when the national side exit the competition.

This figure is cited from research by the University of Lancaster which showed the rise in domestic violence in Lancashire when England lost - as well as a 26 percent rise when the team won or drew.

The 40-second video, which has already been viewed more than 300,000 times on YouTube, includes the strapline: ‘No one wanted England to win more than women.’

A Tender spokesman said: ‘Though research on the rise of domestic violence during the World Cup is relatively new and for lack of a better word, sparse, the trend is alarming and impossible to ignore.

‘The weather is getting warmer, more drinks will be consumed, emotions will be heightened, and none of this excuses violence. We ask that individuals and organisations to stand together this World Cup season and say “No excuses”.’

Tender, a charity based in Belsize Park, north-west London, was set up in 2003 to educate young people through theatre and the arts on preventing violence within relationships.

Its video - released last Tuesday - came after England exited the World Cup having lost their first two group games 2-1 against Italy and Uruguay. They drew their last game 0-0 with Costa Rica.

Before the World Cup began two weeks ago, MailOnline reported how police were launching a crackdown on domestic abusers after research showed violence soars after a match.

Forces across Britain drafted in extra resources, launched hard-hitting poster campaigns and even paid personal visits to known offenders.

In Essex 117 fans, seven of them women, were reportedly handed warnings after officers analysed their history of domestic and footballing crime.

A similar tactic was being employed in Northumbria, where officers warned they would be paying 'special attention' to people who are known to be a risk.

Elsewhere posters in single-sex toilets and on bus stops depict distraught women next to slogans including 'Leave the striking to the players' and 'What time is kick off in your house?'

Officers were keen to stress the vast majority of football fans would cause no problems at all. But the move comes after a report found a steep increase in domestic violence during the tournament.

Researchers from Lancaster University examined crime figures from Lancashire Police during the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups and found there was more violence on days when England played.

In Surrey the increase was far more dramatic - with a 61 per cent leap in domestic violence reports on the day England drew 0-0 with Algeria in South Africa four years ago.
