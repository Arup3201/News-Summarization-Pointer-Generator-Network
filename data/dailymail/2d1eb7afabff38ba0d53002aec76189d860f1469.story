Cristiano Ronaldo may have been some way from full fitness at this World Cup but he still managed to leave his mark, scoring his 50th goal for Portugal and becoming the first player from his nation to score in three consecutive finals.

Paulo Bento’s side won 2-1 against Ghana at the Estadio Nacional thanks to Ronaldo’s late winner, but the three points were not enough to take them above USA, who lost 1-0 to Germany in the group’s other game.

While the likes of Lionel Messi and Neymar have lit up the tournament with some sensational individual displays, their La Liga counterpart has struggled.

Limping out: Ronaldo scored the winner against Ghana but looked to be in pain during the game

A knee complaint that blighted his final few matches of the domestic season followed him to Brazil, and clearly restricted his explosiveness – arguably the defining feature of his game.

Luis Suarez showed against England how great players are able to summon moments of brilliance even when they are clearly far from full fitness.

And against USA in Portugal’s previous match Ronaldo was able to do the same, saving the day for Paulo Bento’s side by swinging a perfect cross for Silvestre Varela to head home at the back post to make it 2-2 in the dying stages.

But, with Portugal requiring not just a victory but also a five-goal swing in their favour to have any hope of progressing to the last 16, it would have taken something superhuman from the Real Madrid star to drag his side through.

Very rarely Ronaldo falls short on the football field, but on this occasion he almost had no say in the matter.

He started the Ghana match well, summoning the spirit of Ronaldinho circa 2002 by crashing an effort against the bar that looked suspiciously like a cross in the sixth minute.

Then midway through the half only a stunning point-blank save from Fatawu Dauda stopped him from making it 1-0 with a thumping header at the back post.

Portugal were ahead shortly after, when

A smart finish from Asamoah Gyan drew Ghana level on the hour mark, before Ronaldo appealed in vain for a penalty after being felled by Boye inside the box.

With 10 minutes to play Ronaldo rattled a low strike into the bottom right corner after some shambolic defending from Ghana saw the ball fall to him 10 yards out.

The goal had little impact on the final standings in Group G. It lifted Portugal above Ghana into third, but USA’s superior goal difference meant they join Germany in the knockout rounds.

Ronaldo, well aware of this, celebrated accordingly.

A short shrug and then a slow walk back to his own half.

Maybe after the game he will reflect more proudly on a finish that takes his tally to 50 for Portugal and makes him the first Selecao player to score in three consecutive World Cup finals.
