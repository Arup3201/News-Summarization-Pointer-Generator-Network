Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was singing Mark Schwarzer's praises after he left the club to join Leicester on a free transfer. 

The 42-year-old will end an 18 month stint at the west London club, indicating that Petr Cech is likely to remain at Stamford Bridge until the end of the season at least.

Schwarzer's arrival to the King Power Stadium will be a welcome addition whilst current first-choice goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel recovers from a broken metatarsal.

'As a goalkeeper, when we needed (Schwarzer), he was there for us, and as a person and a professional he was an amazing guy in our group,' Mourinho said. 

'On behalf of myself, my staff and my players I want to say we are going to miss the big guy and we wish him all the best in his new life at Leicester.'

With young shot-stopper Thibaut Courtois cementing his place in the first team following his return to the club and Petr Cech staying with the Blues after the summer transfer window, Schwarzer's place status in the Chelsea squad meant he became surplus to requirements for Jose Mourinho's team.

Furthermore, Mourinho sees Schwarzer's departure as an opportunity to give homegrown goalkeeper Jamal Blackman some playing time. 

'We'll bring Jamal back from Middlesbrough. He was on loan there but he wasn't playing so for them it's not a problem. 

'For us, he's a young, English goalkeeper. He can work with Courtois and Cech so for him it's a good experience.'
