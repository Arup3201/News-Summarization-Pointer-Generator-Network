Scam: James Cleary stole nearly £32,000 from the cancer research centre where he worked

A cancer research boss at a leading university has been jailed for embezzling nearly £32,000 and spending it on drugs and alcohol.

James Cleary posed as a woman to submit fraudulent invoices for services, and used part of the proceeds to buy BlackBerry phones and laptops for himself.

He was jailed for nearly two years for the scam, which diverted funds away from the search for a cure for Britain's biggest killer disease.

The 40-year-old was research business manager at the University of Manchester's School of Cancer and Enabling Science, which has been named the top cancer research centre in the country.

The department, which works with scientists across the globe doing research into various cancers, was left struggling to pay some bills after Cleary's fraud came to light.

An investigation revealed that 25 forged claims for repayment had been authorised by the manager over a period of three and a half years.

The forms were completed under the name 'Michelle Roberts', but the bank account and sort code numbers on them matched those known to belong to Cleary.

The Salford resident pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court to fraudulently obtaining £31,984 and was jailed for 20 months.

Cleary worked at the University of Manchester in various positions from May 1996 to August 2010.

When he took up the job at the cancer institute he became authorised to sign payment claims, leading him to spend university money on his own drug habit.

Victim: The prestigious University of Manchester was defrauded of thousands of pounds by Cleary

'Cleary was employed in a position of trust by the university, and was given a lot of responsibility to process claims for reasonably large amounts of money,' a police spokesman said today.

'Sadly, he completely abused the trust the university placed in him and defrauded them to the tune of £31,984.

'He admitted during interview he had a drug and alcohol addiction that he needed to fund, and freely volunteered he spent some of the embezzled cash on BlackBerry mobile phones and computers.

'However, he did express remorse and I am sure now that he has been jailed he is even more sorry for his actions.'

The university declined to comment.

On its website, it boasts that 'the government-led Research Assessment Exercise 2008 has officially ranked cancer research in Manchester as the best in the UK.'
