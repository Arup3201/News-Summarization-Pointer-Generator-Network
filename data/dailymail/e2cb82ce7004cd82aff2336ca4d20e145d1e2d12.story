Murdered: NYPD officer Rafael Ramos tried to tell paramedics his name before losing consciousness, according to an ambulance worker on the scene

Fatally wounded NYPD officer Rafael Ramos tried in vain to tell paramedics his name before losing consciousness, the first EMT on the scene said yesterday.

Tantania Alexander, 23, who works for the Bedford-Stuyvesant Volunteer Ambulance Corps, returned to the tragic setting where Ramos and fellow officer Wenjian Liu were murdered on Saturday.

The pair were in their marked NYPD cruiser on a Brooklyn street when gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley opened fire on them, then fled to a subway station where he committed suicide.

Ms Alexander told the New York Post: 'I took charge of both patients. First was the driver [Ramos], he was in the car, his face was pushed to the side of the door.

'He was not moving. We called their names and no response. We pulled them out of the car onto backboards, and my partner started CPR. Each man had shots to the head.

'The driver was shot in the head, the chest and the thigh. [He] was conscious when I started working on him. He tried to tell me his name, and then he just went out.'

The paramedic said Ramos was rushed to Woodhull Medical Center and was still alive when she left him in the hospital's trauma room.

She describes the traumatic experience as an 'open wound' - claiming she still can't believe it happened.

Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said it is unlikely either cop had time to understand what was happening when killer Brinsley, an amateur rapper with a history of criminal convictions, stood by the front passenger window and fired a round of fatal shots into their heads.

Both were taken to Brooklyn's Woodhull Medical Center where they were pronounced dead.

Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio met with Liu's parents and new bride at the hospital, and Ramos' teenage son, who 'couldn't comprehend what had happened'.

'Quite simply, they were assassinated,' Bratton told a press conference. 

Ramos, who celebrated his 40th birthday this month, joined the NYPD in 2012 after working as a school security officer. 

He was a lifelong Brooklyn resident, living in the same Cypress Hills section where he had grown up.

He was married with two sons - one 13-year-old and another in college. His younger son, Jaden, posted a heart-wrenching tribute to his father on Facebook.

He wrote: 'He was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer. Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help.

Ramos' cousin, Ronnie Gonzalez, said the family has already forgiven the gunman.

'He's in the hands of God now,' Gonzalez said. 'We don't believe in vengeance, we just forgive.' 

Brinsley shot his former girlfriend in Baltimore, Maryland, on Saturday morning before traveling 190 miles to New York City with the same gun for his second attack.

According to witnesses, Brinsley walked out of a home with a gun in his hand at 2.47pm, crept up behind the officers' patrol car, and systematically shot both men in the head through the passenger window.

He then walked to the Myrtle/Willoughby G train subway station where he shot himself in the head.

Before: This picture and chilling message was posted on the alleged shooter's page two hours beforehand

The killings came two hours after he posted a picture of a gun on Instagram with the chilling message: 'I'm Putting Wings On Pigs Today.

'They Take 1 Of Ours... Let's Take 2 of Theirs #ShootThePolice #RIPErivGardner (sic) #RIPMikeBrown.

'This May Be My Final Post. I'm Putting Pigs In A Blanket.'

According to NBC, Brinsley - who was armed with a semi-automatic pistol bought in Georgia in 1996 - may have been visiting his child, who is based in Brooklyn.

Speaking at a press conference yesterday, NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce revealed a timeline which began with the shooting of an ex-girlfriend near Baltimore, and ended with Ismaaiyl's suicide on the subway platform.

Describing the final moments, caught on surveillance cameras, he said: 'We have found on one of our videos two males who spoke with the perpetrator just prior to the event.

'He asks them three things: For their gang affiliation, he asks them to follow him on Instagram, then he says 'watch what I'm going to do'.

'He then walks north down on Tompkins, past the two officers in the car, circles back around, goes across the street, then comes up behind the officers.'

Boyce added that Brinsley threatened to hang himself a year ago, and had been disowned by his mother and two sisters for being violent and aggressive.

He said: 'His mother ... states he had a very troubled childhood and was often violent. His mother expressed fear of him and she hasn't seen him in one month.

'Brinsley attempted suicide in the past and attempted to hang himself a year ago.'

Last night, hundreds of New Yorkers gathered at the scene of the shooting with blue flowers, NYPD badges, Christmas wreaths and candles to pay tribute to officers Ramos and Liu.

They sang This Little Light Of Mine and We Shall Overcome. 

Police today revealed a timeline of Ismaaiyl Brinsley's movements on a day that began with the unauthorized entry into his ex-girlfriend's flat and ended with his suicide in a Brooklyn subway station:

5.30am

Enters apartment of ex-girlfriend Shaneka Thompson in Owings Mills, Maryland with a key he should not have had. They argue.

5.50am

Brinsley fires a single shot at Thompson, reportedly into her stomach. He flees with her cell phone.

6.05am

Brinsley calls Thompson's mother to apologize for shooting her. He claims it is an accident, and that he hopes she lives.

6.35am

Baltimore County Police begins monitoring him. They track Thompson's cellphone to the I-95 freeway, where he is believed to have been riding a bus. During the journey he keeps phoning Thompson's mom, and reveals he is headed to New York City.

10.50am

Brinsley arrives in New York City, in the West Side, and rides the subway to Brooklyn.

12.07pm

He throws away Thompson's phone in the Barclays Center. The NYPD later recovered it. Investigators are unclear where he goes between midday and the killings at 2.47pm.

1.30pm

Baltimore County Police send the NYPD a fax alerting them to Brinsley and his intentions. By the time it filters down to the rank-and-file, he has already struck.

2.47pm

Brinsley identifies his targets in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, tells passersby to watch, then fires four shots at them.

As he flees he confronts two Con Edison drivers, who chase him in their truck and point officers in their direction.

He runs into the Myrtle/Willoughby G train station, where he shoots himself dead on the platform
