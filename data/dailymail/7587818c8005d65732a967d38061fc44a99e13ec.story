Manchester United touched down in Washington on Sunday night as their whistlestop pre-season tour of the United States continues apace.

United will take on Inter Milan at the FedEx Field in the early hours of Wednesday morning UK time as they seek to continue their winning start to the Louis van Gaal era.

The squad disembarked their flight from Denver dressed smartly in club suits and ties, with the Dutch boss leading the way.

Van Gaal has made an impressive start to his tenure at Old Trafford, with United thrashing Los Angeles Galaxy 7-0 last week and then beating Roma 3-2 on Saturday night.

Wayne Rooney has been in fine form, scoring four goals, including a spectacular long-range strike against the Italian side.

The Scot will be joined by six members of the Glazer family, who own United, swelling the numbers in the United touring party to more than 170.

After returning from America, United welcome Valencia to Old Trafford on August 12 before opening their Premier League campaign at home to Swansea City on August 16.

Robin van Persie, meanwhile, is back in his native Holland after Van Gaal gave him three weeks off following the World Cup. 

The Dutch striker tweeted a picture of the Rotterdam skyline as he continues his rest and recuperation ahead of the coming season.

He will miss United's tour of the States but will return in time for the start of the Premier League campaign.
