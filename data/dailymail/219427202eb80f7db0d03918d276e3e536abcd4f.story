As historic talks between the United States and Cuba begin, there is great hope that the two will be able to successfully restore diplomatic ties. 

Such a step forward marks the end of almost 50 years of Cold War-era hostility between the two countries.

Cuba, recognised for its architecture and infrastructure of a bygone era, now faces a new reality, threatening the nation's traditional way of life.

As diplomatic ties between the US and Cuba are reestablish, Cubans face a new reality. Pictured: A Cuban woman walking past a mural along San Lazaro Street in Havana

The United States flag is already appearing in small ways, including in the clothing - such as head scarves and tights - worn by locals.

It's also expected that with the end of restricted travel between the former Cold War enemies, that Cuba will also gain easier access to the American telecommunications technology, building materials and American food products.

Though currently vintage American convertible cars are often spotted along the Prado boulevard, a wide avenue that runs from Parque Central to the Malecon seafront highway, they may soon be replaced by more modern models.

The rejuvenating of international relations began in December 2014.

President Obama began by announcing a 'new chapter' in US relations with Cuba, with plans announced by the White House include easing access for US citizens, lessening financial restrictions, and lifting the 54-year-old trade embargo. 

And while the landmark thaw is relations signals a positive future for Cuba, travellers looking to explore the 'timewarp' nation are being urged to go now, before it changes forever.

Often, players cut their hair to emulate their favourite soccer players, but their shoes are full of holes and there's only one ball to play with

As part of resuming diplomatic relations with Cuba, the US will soon reopen an embassy in the capital of Havana and carry out high-level exchanges and visits between the governments.

Cubans can now apply for visas to travel to the Unites States, at the U.S. Interests Section building in Havana's Malecon in the district of Vedado, Plaza de la Revolucion.

Licensed American travelers to Cuba will now be able to return to the US with $400 in Cuban goods, including tobacco and alcohol products worth less than $100 combined. This means the long-standing ban on importing Cuban cigars is over, although there are still limits.

The US is also increasing the amount of money Americans can send to Cubans from $500 to $2,000 per quarter, or every three months. Early in his presidency, Obama allowed unlimited family visits by Cuban-Americans and removed a $1,200 annual cap on remittances. Secretary of State John Kerry is also launching a review of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terror.

Obama does not have the authority to fully lift the long-standing US economic embargo on Cuba, given that Congress enacted that policy. However, officials said he would welcome lawmakers taking that step.
