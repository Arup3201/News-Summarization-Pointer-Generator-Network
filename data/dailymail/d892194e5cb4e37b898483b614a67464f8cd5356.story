Fears: The Government says thousands of girls and women in Britain are forced into marriages every year

Teenage girls who fear they are being taken abroad to enter into a forced marriage are escaping by putting metal spoons in their underwear, a charity has revealed.

Karma Nirvana, a Derby-based campaign group which supports victims of forced marriage, advises girls to use a spoon, or any other metal object, to set off detectors at the airport and separate themselves from parents.

The charity says a number of girls have used the tactic to avoid being taken overseas and entered into a life of servitude.

Last week, the Government warned that
 thousands of schoolgirls are at risk of being sent away to enter into 
forced marriages during the summer holidays.

The
 Foreign Office's Forced Marriage Unit gave support for 1,485 cases up 
to December 2012, although it is feared many more go unreported. Around 
400 of these were reported int he three months up to the end of August.

More than a third were under the age of 17 and more than 80 per cent were female.

Speaking
 to the AFP news agency, Natasha Rattu, Karma Nirvana's operations 
manager, said that when worried youngsters ring the charity's helpline, 
'if they don't know exactly when it may happen or if it's going to 
happen, we advise them to put a spoon in their underwear.

'When they go through security, it will highlight this object in a private area and, if 16 or over, they will be taken to a safe space where they have that one last opportunity to disclose they're being forced to marry.'

Trick: Having a metal spoon on their person is being used as a last-minute tactic to set off airport security by girls to escape their parents

Doctors, teachers and airport staff are among those being asked to remain vigilant to the possibility of young girls being taken away during the summer break.

Of the cases that the FMU handles, almost half relate to forced marriages in Pakistan. Other countries where girls are sent include Bangladesh, India, Somalia, Turkey, Iraq and Iran.

The oldest case was a woman aged 71 and the youngest just two-years-old.

A victim, whose identity was protected by Essex Police, told AFP that her father forced her into a marriage in India, after threatening to find her and kill her if she tried to run away.

'I was shipped off with a total stranger. That night I was raped by my husband and this abuse continued for about eight and half years of my life,' she said. She later escaped.
