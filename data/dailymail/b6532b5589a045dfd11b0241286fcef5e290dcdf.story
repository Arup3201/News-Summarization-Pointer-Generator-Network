The culling of badgers in the countryside to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis has begun, the National Farmers' Union said this morning.

Militant hunt saboteurs have vowed to disrupt the cull by infiltrating animal rights groups planning peaceful protests.

Police have increased patrols in the countryside fearing violent clashes between farmers and hardcore opponents following the start of the cull.

The Environment Secretary today insisted that the cull was necessary for the health of badgers as well as livestock, saying that he was concerned for the animals' welfare as he used to have pet badgers - but added that it could take 25 years before the work of the cull is completed

In a letter to farmers today, NFU 
president Peter Kendall revealed that culling had already begun in west 
Gloucestershire and west Somerset.

He
said that the move, which will see around 5,000 badgers killed over the
next six weeks in two pilot schemes, was 'an important step not just 
for cattle farmers but for the whole farming industry'.

He
continued: 'We cannot go on culling tens of thousands of cattle every 
year because of TB while knowing the disease exists in wildlife 
uncontrolled.

'Badger 
control remains a controversial subject and we understand that some 
people will never agree with controlling badgers in this way.

'I
am confident however that through the combined efforts of farmers, the 
NFU and government over the last year to illustrate the impact TB has on
farms, and the scientific basis for badger control, more people than 
ever recognise the need to address the disease in badgers.'

More than 500 protesters are expected
at the sites of the cull, with even some of those planning to 
demonstrate peacefully saying they are prepared to run from footpaths 
into the line of fire of the farmers culling the badgers to force them 
to put down their arms.

But
Mr Kendall insisted: 'I hope that when time shows that these culls have
reduced TB in cattle - just as has happened in Ireland - that even more
people will understand that while sad, these culls are absolutely 
necessary.

'I hope that you
will continue to show support for those farmers who are facing the 
nightmare of TB on farm and especially for those who are in the culling 
areas.'

The cull is an attempt to tackle bovine 
TB which is transmitted by badgers and has led to the death of 305,000 
cattle in the UK over the past decade.

'I've
actually had pet badgers as a child, and I want to see healthy 
badgers,' Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told Sky News.

'If
we had a workable vaccine, we would use it. A badger vaccine would have
no effect on the high proportion of sick badgers in TB hotspots who 
would continue to spread the disease.

'We
are working on new badger and cattle vaccines but they are years away 
from being ready and we cannot afford to wait while TB gets worse.'

He added: 'The intention is to roll out this policy in other areas next year subject to these two culls proving effective, efficient and humane. My target is that the UK should be TB free in 25 years.

'We know that, despite the strict controls we already have in place, we won't get on top of this terrible disease until we start dealing with the infection in badgers as well as in cattle. That's the clear lesson from Australia, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland and the USA.

'That is why these pilot culls are so important. We have to use every tool in the box because TB is so difficult to eradicate and it is spreading rapidly.'

Labour claimed the coalition had cut spending and research on vaccines for badgers and cattle, and said the Environment Department's official assessment of the pilot culls had revealed it would cost £4million to police the two schemes.

Shadow environment secretary Mary Creagh said: 'The Government's divisive badger cull will cost more than it saves and will spread bovine TB in the short term as badgers are disturbed by shooting.

'We need a science-led policy to manage cattle movements better and a vaccine to tackle TB in cattle. Ministers should listen to the scientists and drop this cull which is bad for farmers, bad for taxpayers and bad for wildlife.'

March: Animal rights activists paraded in the area where the cull was due to take place in a last-minute protest

Anger: Passionate protesters have vowed to block the cull from going ahead this week

Police have said militant campaigners
have infiltrated local campsites and have been spotted patrolling 
farmers’ fields wearing balaclavas at night. One group, Bristol Hunt 
Saboteurs, said it would trespass on to sites with large horns to scare 
the badgers away and remove bait left by farmers.

Last night Somerset Badger Patrol held a vigil event in Minehead against the cull.

A
statement on its Facebook page after the event said: 'Over 200 people 
tonight at the procession, thank you all so much for coming... We fight 
on, knowing that we are right helps.'

It comes as a protester, named as Jay Tiernan, was arrested yesterday 
for allegedly trying to break in to a Department for Environment, Food 
and Rural Affairs site in Stroud, Gloucestershire.

Joe
Mossman, of Bristol Hunt Saboteurs, said ‘extensive research’ had been 
carried out to find out where the badgers’ setts are and where peanut 
bait had been laid by farmers.

He
added: ‘The intention is to just turn up in large numbers, making lots 
of noise, getting in the way and having a massive presence. We will try 
to locate the shooters, which will involve trespass if necessary.

‘Spoiling bait is one of the  most effective ways you can sabotage the cull, because if the bait’s not there the badgers won’t be drawn away.’

Dozens of people have also set up a camp, dubbed Camp Badger, on the outskirts of the sleepy harbour town of Watchet, Somerset.

Mostly members of campaign group Stop The Cull, they intend to carry out nocturnal patrols looking to document evidence of wounded badgers.

Protest: Animal rights groups say badgers should be vaccinated instead of culled

Carla Kidd, 39, a gardener from Penzance, Cornwall, said: ‘If it came down to it and I was in the killing zone, then yes, I would run in front to try and stop the shooting. That would be my natural reaction.‘It’s your natural instinct to protect an animal as if it was a pet or your own child.'

'Our intention is to carry out peaceful protest while on patrol at night and stick to the footpaths, but I couldn’t say that I’d stick to that if I saw culling. Our main task is about raising awareness.’

Miss Kidd added that protest groups had been buoyed by recent anti-fracking protests in Balcombe, West Sussex, when hundreds of activists were able to stop exploratory drilling temporarily.

The past 15 years has seen a boom in bovine TB which is spread to cattle when badgers urinate on grass which is eaten by cows.

The trial scheme is due to continue every year for the next four years, and is predicted to cut bovine TB by 16 per cent.

Two
companies have been given the licence to carry out the culling in the 
counties, but both Defra and Natural England, the public body 
responsible for the operation, have kept their identities a secret in 
case activists target them directly.

Last
week the National Farmers Union was granted an injunction in the High 
Court barring anti-cull activists from approaching farmers’ homes, 
business premises and cull sites.

Animal
rights groups, which include support from guitarist Brian May and 
actress Dame Judi Dench, say the authorities should vaccinate badgers 
instead.
