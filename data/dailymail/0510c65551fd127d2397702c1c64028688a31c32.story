A runaway asylum seeker has been rearrested at the home of his Serco security guard lover, just after the birth of their newborn.

After fleeing from a Brisbane detention facility nine months ago, detainee Aziz Ali Abdulkader was taken back into custody on Thursday morning.

Immigration officials raided the female prison guard's home in Greenacre, where Mr Abdulkader was rearrested, a Serco whistleblower who allegedly employs the female security guard told Ray Hadley on 2GB radio.

After fleeing from a Brisbane detention facility nine months ago, detainee Aziz Ali Abdulkader was taken back into custody on Thursday morning

Mr Abdulkader has reportedly been on the run since January 21, when he escaped during a transfer from a Brisbane detention centre to a hospital.

Immigration officers contacted the female security guard but 'were put through to the maternity ward where she had just given birth to a baby allegedly fathered by a detainee who has been on the run', Hadley told his 2GB listeners.

According to the whistleblower who runs the Brisbane Immigration Transit Centre, the female officer's sister was also a Serco security guard. 

'They are investigation fraud and rorts being performed by another Serco employee where government funds have been claimed illegitimately,' Hadley said. 

Steve McMahon, chair of the Prison Officers Vocational Branch of the PSA expressed his concern with private operators, such as Serco, running federal facilities.

Serco is a British contractor who is contracted by the Australian government for $1.8 billion

'These services are and should be solely the responsibility to the government - when handed to private contractors this is what happens,' Mr McMahon told Daily Mail Australia.

'The entry level scrutiny isn't any where near to the same standards as public persons.

'When private operators operate a federal facility their loyalty is between them and their share holders.

Mr McMahon said that the government has justified their contract with Serco because  it is more cost effective. 

'In the mean time they are cutting corners and not paying their staff properly - which is when things like this happen,' he said.

Serco is a British contractor who is contracted by the Australian government for $1.8 billion. 

The British company has been involved in a number of controversial incidents involving security failures that saw 63 people escape from detention last year. 

Daily Mail Australia contacted Serco for comment, however a spokesman said it was inappropriate to provide comment while an investigation is under-way. 

A spokesperson for the Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said, 'The Minister has been advised that the department has requested a formal investigation of the matter by the service provider. 

'This matter is also being referred to the AFP.'
