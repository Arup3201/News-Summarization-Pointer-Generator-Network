Police used dental records to identify the remains of Vinny Derrick who vanished in 2003

Human remains found under a motorway flyover have been identified as a man who has been missing for more than eight years.

Police used dental records to identify the remains of Vinny Derrick, who vanished on a night out with colleagues in Manchester city centre in the early hours of August 30 2003.

They were found in an area beneath the flyover near junction 3 of the M60 in Stockport, Greater Manchester, by workmen on Wednesday morning.

Police said today they are still not sure if Mr Derrick died in suspicious circumstances and are continuing to examine the scene.

Detective Chief Inspector Sara Wallwork, of Stockport CID, said: 'Vinny's family have spent more than eight painful years wondering what happened to him.

'I am aware that they will have many more questions that need answering and we will work as quickly as we can to provide them.

'We are expecting to be at the scene throughout Friday and possibly beyond.

'These are difficult and complex inquiries and I want to stress that, while we will carry these out as quickly as possible, it could take some time.'

The married father-of-one from Sale in Greater Manchester was 28 when he disappeared.

He left the Jabez Clegg nightclub in Dover Street, Manchester sometime after midnight but failed to arrive at his bossâ€™s house in Heald Green, 
Stockport, where he was due to spend the night.

It is thought he was dropped off by a taxi driver at a roundabout near the John Lewis store in Cheadle - about two miles from where the remains were unearthed.

His heartbroken family made numerous appeals for information about his whereabouts.

On Wednesday evening there was a large police presence at the scene of the discovery, near a railway embankment by junction three of the motorway.

The area was cordoned off by officers and forensic work is expected to take several days.

It is understood there was no clothing or documents by the remains.
