Hands clasped around her 12-year-old pupil's neck, this is the horrifying moment that a furious Polish teacher tried to to strangle an epileptic boy while he was having a fit in class. 

Enraged that her lesson had been interrupted the educator, identified as Jadwiga Piotrowska, began throttling the boy called Kuba and telling him to stop, according to his classmates at the primary school, in the village of Sienno in east-central Poland.

'At first we didn't know what was going on and thought it was some sort of joke,' one pupil said. 'But she began to shake him and tighten her grip. Other children began crying and we begged her to let go of him.'

As the 12-year-old boy called Kuba had an epileptic fit, his teacher Jadwiga Piotrowska began throttling him. His fellow pupils said she was furious that her lesson had been interrupted   

The headmaster of the primary school, in the village of Sienno in east-central Poland said he had to pull her off the pupil. Czeslaw Sieczka added that he thought she must have had some sort of breakdown

Terrified that the 48-year-old would cause serious damage, the children rushed to get the school's head, Czeslaw Sieczka. 

'The children burst into my office in hysterics,' said the 55-year-old education veteran. 'Fortunately the classroom is right next door to my office so I managed to get there quickly and pull her off.'

He added: 'She was very excited emotionally, and she laughed and cried alternately. She said she was trying to cure him. It's the first time I've seen something like this.I can't understand what got into her.' 

He did not give any information about Kuba's condition. The boy is known to live at a local orphanage.    

As a result of the attack Sieczka said Piotrowska, who is married to the village's former mayor, had been immediately suspended from duty was receiving psychological treatment at her own request.

'She is a respected teacher with over 20 years experience,' he said. 'I can only speculate that she had a breakdown after her husband lost his position as mayor in the recent elections.' 

A spokesman for the local prosecutor's office said they were looking into the matter.
