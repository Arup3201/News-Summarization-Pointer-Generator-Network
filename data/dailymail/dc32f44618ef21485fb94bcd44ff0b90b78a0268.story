Eleven more inquiries are to be held into the conduct of British soldiers while serving in Iraq, it has emerged.

It comes after the High Court ruled that any allegations of Iraqi civilians dying in British custody must be investigated under human rights laws.

In response, the Ministry of Defence has ordered that inquest-style hearings are held into the deaths of 11 Iraqi civilians who were killed while British troops operated in the country after the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.

With each individual hearing taking approximately three months, the inquiries will cost the public purse around £2million, The Sunday Telegraph reports.

The MoD inquiries will follow the format of an inquest and will be chaired by a former judge of QC.

The High Court did reject demands for open inquiries but its ruled that the deaths must still be investigated under Article Two of the European Convention on Human Rights — the right to life.

This has now opened the way for 160 
further cases of alleged British involvement in the deaths of Iraqis to 
be brought forward for inquiry.

Hearings could also be held into 
nearly 800 allegations that British troops broke Article Three of the 
Convention on Human Rights prohibiting torture.

Jailed: Sergeant Alexander Blackman was jailed for at least ten years for murdering a badly wounded Taliban insurgent

A ministry spokesman said: 'We welcome the decision of the High Court to reject demands for a public inquiry into all allegations of wrongdoing by British forces in Iraq, which it argued would not be a reasonable or proportionate use of taxpayers’ money.'

But the action has drawn criticism from MPs and military leaders alike.

Colonel Tim Collins, who led 1st Bn the Royal Irish Regiment during the Iraq invasion, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'The Human Rights Act has a lot to answer for. It has turned into a bean feast for ambulance-chasing lawyers. They are trying to apply the rules that you would to a fairground, to Her Majesty’s Armed Forces.'

While Julian Brazier MP, a former SAS reservist who sits on the Commons defence committee, told the newspaper: 'I am firmly in favour of the military processes that are in place examining allegations of breaches of the Geneva Convention. This feast for human rights lawyers is an abuse of process, demoralising for the Armed Forces.'

This latest revelation comes after the mounting backlash against the sentencing earlier this week of Sergeant Alexander Blackman, 39, for killing an injured Taliban captive in Afghanistan.

Blackman was sentenced to life, serving a minimum of ten years, and was dishonourably discharged from the Royal Marines.

Many have spoken out in his defence and have called for his prison sentence to be shortened.

Lord Ashcroft has now also thrown his support behind Blackman, The Sunday Times reports.

In a tweet yesterday, the former Tory party treasurer said: 'If asked, I would contribute towards the legal costs of Sergeant Blackman's appeal.'

Support: Lord Michael Ashcroft is the latest to throw his support behind Sergeant Alexander Blackman - even offering to pay the legal fees of his appeal
