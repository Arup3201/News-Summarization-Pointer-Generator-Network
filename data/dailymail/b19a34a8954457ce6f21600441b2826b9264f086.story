An Only Fools and Horses superfan has spent 50 hours under the tattooist's needle getting a giant mural of his favourite show etched onto his back.

Darren Williams, from Bristol, spent £4,000 and two months in the tattoo parlour perfecting the tribute, complete with Del Boy, Rodney, Uncle Albert, Trigger, Boycie, and Nelson Mandela House. 

The giant inking even features the iconic yellow Reliant Regal van driven by Del and Rodney, played by David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst.

Mr Williams, 47, underwent ten painful five-hour sessions to have the tattoo emblazoned on his back - and even cancelled a planned holiday to Barbados so that it could be completed.

The father-of four said: 'I'm over the moon with it. I have always loved the show, it's one of those ones that you can just keep on watching and it will always be funny. 

'My wife's not a massive fan of it, she doesn't like tattoos, but she said "It's your body, you can do what you want with it.

The inking includes Del Boy, Rodney, Uncle Albert, Trigger, and Boycie, and was completed in stages

But despite his extreme tribute to the show Mr Williams insists he is not a 'fanatical' and he 'just liked the design'

'I think it's fantastic.'

Mr Williams, a specialist damp proofer, often works close to the block of flats filmed in the classic BBC comedy set in Peckham, South London. 

Nelson Mandela House - the fictional home of Del Boy, Rodney, and Uncle Albert - was actually a block of flats in Bristol called Whitemead House. 

Mr Williams' tattoo was carried out by George Torrington, 24, and completed six weeks ago.

He said: I love the programme, obviously, but it was the tattooist's idea. It was all his own work. 

'I'm not like an obsessive. 

'I have met a lot of the cast. There was a convention at the Bristol City ground which I went along to a few years ago. 

'I met Boycie, Marlene, Sid, Denzel, Mickey Pierce - they were all lovely, just like they are on the TV.'
