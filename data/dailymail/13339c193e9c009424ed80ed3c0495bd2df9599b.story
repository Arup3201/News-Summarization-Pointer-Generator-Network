First, there was the cake made to look like an astonishingly realistic raw turkey. Now food artist, Sarah Hardy, has turned her attention to creating sweet treats that look like scarily lifelike bugs.

The sweets, which were inspired by Hardy's passion for natural history, includes a leech, a garden snail, a warty toad, a newt, fossils and an endangered beetle - all of which are made from chocolate.

The bizarre sweets, which will go on sale at Selfridges from September, will appeal to children with a penchant for creepie crawlies as well as natural history lovers, say Hardy and her business partner, Chris Verraes.

Realistic: This snail (and its cabbage leaf) might look lifelike but they're actually made from chocolate

Sarah said: 'We are following our passions and this has led to us wanting to create a fun, family friendly business.

'We are artists with a love of 
natural history and a background in luxury confections. So obviously we 
had to make Boy Eats Bug happen!'

Although the pair are self-taught chocolatiers, they say their background in cake making, sculpting and crafting backgrounds gave them all the skills they needed, along with a mutual love of the natural world.

'We can hopefully all remember what it was like to be a child, discovering something for the first time,' added Chris,

â€˜The wonder and excitement of being confronted by something amazing - something strangely beautiful like a frog or a dragonfly or a dinosaur.'

Christmas dinner: Sarah's amazingly realistic 'raw turkey' was actually an orange drizzle cake

Tasty: Once the 'turkey' was sliced into, its sweet secret was revealed - much to the Hardy family's relief

In December last year Sarah made a turkey cake so realistic it was almost impossible to distinguish it from a real raw turkey.

The baker spent three days working on her realistic cake, which was served on a foil tray and even featured a piece of string holding the turkey 'legs' together.

'I just made it as a one-off to freak out my family,' said Sarah, who worked in secret at night to ensure her creation was a complete surprise on Christmas Day.

'The most unappealing thing I could think of to give them was raw meat. They're used to me doing beautiful things like wedding cakes, so this was something different.

'Nobody actually believed it was a cake until we sliced into it. When we did everyone stood up and I realised they were all crowding around to take pictures.'

Although Hardy said she hopes to create more 'turkeys', for now she and Verraes are working on an installation called 'Darwin's Parlour', which will form part of the Appetite Food Festival in East London this month.
