A British fighter who travelled to Iraq to stop the Islamic State claims the terror group fed a murdered kidnap victim to his own mother after she went to their headquarters and demanded to see him.

Yasir Abdulla, a security guard from Keighley, West Yorkshire decided to go to Iraq and fight against ISIS after hearing they came within six miles of taking control of his home village in Kurdistan, which he left in 2000.

It has been reported that the 36-year-old bought a set to combat fatigues online for £100 before going to Kurdistan and buying an assault rifle.

He then joined hundreds of other Kurdish and Peshmerga forces who are trying to stop the spread of ISIS by patrolling a ten-mile front line in Iraq.

Mr Abdulla returned to the UK last week but told The Sun how an elderly Kurdish woman, whose son was captured by ISIS and taken to Mosul, went to meet the jihadis to try and secure his release and was then fed his body.

The father of four told the newspaper: 'She was determined to find her son and went to ISIS headquarters and asked to see him.

'The ISIS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

'They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were kind.

'But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said "You've just eaten him."'

During his time on the front line, Mr Abdulla revealed how ISIS are terrorising locals by calling them and threatening to kidnap them and bury them alive unless they surrender.

He also told of how the terror group kill prisoners they capture by throwing them on a 'human bonfire' and that he saw his own cousin killed in an ISIS attack.

But despite returning back to his family in Yorkshire, Mr Abdulla is keen to go back to Kurdistan saying he wants to finish the job in defeating ISIS.

The new details about the cruelty of ISIS come as Iraq's prime minister called on tribal fighters to abandon the jihadis ahead of an offensive to retake Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from extremists.

Haider al-Abadi offered no timeline for an attack on Tikrit, 80 miles north of Baghdad, which fell into the hands of ISIS last summer.

ISIS and Al Qaeda are hiding messages to their followers in digitally-altered eBay photos and even pornography, a book claims.

Investigative journalist Gordon Thomas said Al Qaeda has used the tactic of 'steganography' - concealing messages in audio clips or images widely available online - to encode items listed for sale on the auction site.

It works by manipulating a sound waveform or the order of pixels in a small or invisible part of an image, a process not unlike the way teletext used to be delivered on analogue TVs.

Now Israeli intelligence service Mossad believes ISIS militants are doing the same, according to Mr Thomas.

One intelligence source told him messages are often hidden on Reddit or 'X-rated pornographic pictures which conceal documents and orders for the next target'.

The claims are contained within new chapters of Mr Thomas' book Gideon's Spies, an extract of which was published yesterday by the New York Post. 

However, Shiite militias and Iraqi security forces have stationed themselves around Tikrit as state-run media has warned that the city 'will soon return to its people.'

Tikrit, which occasionally saw attacks on U.S. forces during the American occupation of the country, is one of the biggest cities held by ISIS.

It also sits on the road to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, which is also held by the extremists.

It has also been revealed that in February alone, violence across Iraq killed at least 1,100 Iraqis, including more than 600 civilians, according to the the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq.

UN envoy Nickolay Mladenov blamed the deaths on the extremist group, government forces and pro-government Shiite militias.

He explained: 'Daily terrorist attacks perpetrated by ISIS continue to deliberately target all Iraqis.

'There also concerning reports of a number of revenge killings by armed groups in areas recently liberated from ISIS.'

Last year was the deadliest in Iraq since its 2006-2007 sectarian bloodshed, with a total of 12,282 people killed and 23,126 wounded, according to the UN.

Pro-ISIS supporters wave flags as they parade through Mosul in Iraq. A British fighter has told how a Kurdish mother, whose son was kidnapped and murdered by the group, was fed his body when she travelled to Mosul demanding to see him 

Yasir Abdulla also says that ISIS fighters, pictured, terrorise locals by calling them on the phone and threatening to bury them alive unless they surrender to them
