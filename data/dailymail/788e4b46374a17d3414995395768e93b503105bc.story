An adorable black and white kitten has had part of its leg ‘ripped off’ after it was thrown from a van in a horrific act of cruelty.

She also suffered trauma to her face and her front right leg is currently paralysed. 

The kitten was tossed out of a small white van with no rear windows, travelling south on Marmion Avenue, in Quinns Rocks, an outer coastal suburb of Perth, WA, on Monday.

The RSPCA are seeking the public’s help in finding the passenger who threw the kitten out of a window just before a roundabout at Hester Avenue.

The animal was rescued by a person in the vehicle following the van after it bounced off the van and rolled onto the road.

RSPCA WA Deputy Chief Inspector Sharon Morgan said the kitten’s left rear leg was ripped off which may result in the leg being amputated.

Part of her leg was ripped off after she was abandoned in a truly horrific way 

‘The RSPCA would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident and may have the number plate or a description of the van.

‘For the RSPCA to investigate we need more details and we are hoping a member of the public may be able to assist us.

‘This type of behaviour is outrageous and we’re seeking assistance from the public to provide information regarding this incident,’ Inspector Morgan said.

Anyone with information is asked to contacted the RSPCA WA on 1300 Cruelty (1300 278 3589).
