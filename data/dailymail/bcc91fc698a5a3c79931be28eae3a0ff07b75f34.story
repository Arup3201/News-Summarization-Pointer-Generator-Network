Chelsea have stepped up their search for a new striker by turning their attention to Queens Park Rangers' Loic Remy.

Jose Mourinho is keen to add another forward to his squad following Fernando Torres' move to AC Milan on a two-year deal.

Torres' departure leaves Mourinho with just Diego Costa and Didier Drogba as recognised senior strikers.

And the Stamford Bridge supremo is hoping to tempt Remy across West London with the promise of Champions League football.

Chelsea have contacted QPR about the striker's availability on either a loan or permanent deal. The former Marseille man's versatility means that he could operate as a central striker or wide in a front three.

Remy has made it clear that he wants to leave Loftus Road for a team playing in Europe's elite competition and it is believed the French international would jump at the chance to move to Stamford Bridge.

The 27-year-old impressed on loan at Newcastle United last season, scoring 14 goals in 26 league games.

Form: Remy scored an impressive 14 goals in 26 league games during a loan spell at Newcastle last season

Versatile: France international Remy would give Chelsea options both at central striker and in wide channels
