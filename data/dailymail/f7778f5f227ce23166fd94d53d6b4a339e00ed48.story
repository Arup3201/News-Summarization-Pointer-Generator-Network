A new YouTube video gives a terrifying portrayal of the vulnerability of drunk women - and the shocking lengths that some men will go to in order to take advantage of their inebriated state. 

The video, which was created by social media entrepreneur Stephen Zhang, follows a young woman - who is pretending to be seriously intoxicated - as she tries to find her way home from Hollywood Boulevard.

Throughout the video, the young woman, who introduces herself as Jennifer, appears to be sipping from a beer can as she staggers from one man to another asking for directions to her bus stop.

'I've had a little too much to drink': The woman, who introduces herself as Jennifer, approaches five different men on Hollywood Boulevard in order to ask for directions to her bus stop

During the four-minute video, Jennifer approaches five different men and each time makes clear that she needs to find a bus which will take her home to Culver City.

Introducing the video, the woman briefly explains the details of the experiment, saying: 'Hey guys, today I'm on Hollywood Boulevard, I've had a little too much to drink. Let's see if anyone will help me to get home.' 

Shockingly, of the five men featured, only one actually offers her assistance, while the rest attempt to lure her back to their homes - despite her obviously drunken state. 

'Hey, where you going?' the first man asks. 'You don't need to take a bus, we're going to go this way. We're going to go somewhere else... to my house. There's a bus line at my house.'

'I just want to help you': Another man tries to get the young woman into his car (pictured)

'I have more beer': One of the last men Jennifer approaches offers to give her more alcohol - if she will go back to his place and 'hang out' 

He later adds: 'I got a water bed, I got all of that. Come on, it's right there.'

Another asks whether Jennifer wants to 'hang out' at his home, before he tries to convince her to get into his car.

'Let's go, come on,' he says. 'I just want to help you so much. It's OK, just come with me.' 

The last two men featured in the video nearly come to blows deciding who will get the chance to escort Jennifer home. 

While one is offering to take Jennifer back to his place, where he has 'more beer', the second interrupts their conversation - and for a brief moment it seems like he might actually be staging a rescue, as he tells the first man to 'f**k off'.

Sadly that isn't the case. 

'You're not going home with him, you're coming home with me,' he says to Jennifer, before adding: 'You shouldn't hang around with such losers, [my place] is close by.'

Only one man - the second person to be approached during filming - tries to help Jennifer find her bus stop and even offers her assistance as she makes her way down some stairs.

The shocking video footage comes just a few weeks after a similar clip (see below), which documented the verbal harassment one woman received while walking around New York City, surfaced online, sparking outrage from women around the world. 

That video has since been watched by more than 35 million people.
