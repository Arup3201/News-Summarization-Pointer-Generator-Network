The US Army confirmed Monday that Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is returning to active duty just four weeks on from his return to the United States after five years as a Taliban captive - and will be working behind a desk.

In a phone interview with MailOnline, Col. Scott Bleichwell said 'It's an office job within the headquarters - just general office work.'

Bleichwehl explained that Bergdahl will also have a sponsor, which he described as 'a person who's designated, not only for him, but for every soldier in Army North [...] and assists with assimilating into the unit.'

The sponsor helps with 'very basic administrative functions,' Bleichwehl said, which include '[helping become] a part of the unit, processing records, becoming familiar with the day to day schedule.'

'We're always there for every soldier,' he said.

Bergdahl may also receive $350,000 from the US government without paying taxes: $200,000 would be for wages earned during his captivity and $150,000 if he in fact was a prisoner of war, according to Fox News.

Return to duty: This is Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl six weeks ago at his handover by the Taliban to US forces.  The US Army said Monday he will return to active duty

Responding to that report, Army spokeswoman Lt. Col. Alayne Conway told MailOnline 'The Army's determination of Sgt. Bergdahl's eligibility for pay and benefits will be in accordance with the appropriate laws, regulations and policies. Pay is always linked to duty status.' 

In a statement, the Army said that the soldier 'has completed the final phase of the reintegration process under the control of U.S. Army South and is currently being assigned to U.S. Army North, Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston (JBSA).'

'He will now return to regular duty within the command where he can contribute to the mission. The Army investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the disappearance and capture of Bergdahl is still ongoing.'

According to the New York Times, Bergdahl was in therapy at Fort Sam Houston.

Since his return from Afghanistan, Sgt. Bergdahl has been involved in debriefings with his superiors, the newspaper said.

Just last week, a photo of Bergdahl, 
smiling and posing with a former senior Taliban official in Afghanistan 
was posted on Twitter.

This photo of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, smiling and posing with Taliban Commander Badruddin Haqqani, a senior member of the Haqqani network in Afghanistan, was posted on Twitter on Wednesday

The
 Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) confirmed Bergdahl was photographed next to Taliban Commander Badruddin Haqqani.

The son of Jalaluddin Haqqani, he reportedly worked in the Haqqani organization and 
was killed in a U.S. drone strike in August 2012, CNN said at the time.

Former POW Bergdahl was controversially released by the Taliban in May in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay detainees.

Soldiers who served with Bergdahl before he 
left his post in Afghanistan in 2009 told Fox News they have still not been 
contacted by military investigators.

Questions: A new investigation has been launched to determine whether Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, pictured, deserted his post or went AWOL when he was reported missing in Afghanistan in 2009

Left out: Former platoon leader and Army Sgt. Evan Buetow, pictured in a previous Fox interview, said he believes the investigators have already made up their mind about what happened

'I think it's very clear he 
deserted his post,' Army Sgt. Evan Buetow told FoxNews.com. 'He thought about what he 
was doing, he mailed some things home, he walked away and we have 
witnesses who saw him walking away.

'And if you’re walking away in one of
 the worst, most dangerous areas of Afghanistan without your weapon and 
gear, I don’t believe you’re planning on coming back.'

Of the investigation, Buetow added: 'They've already concluded what they want to be said. They know exactly what happened.'

Former
 Army Sgt. Matt Vierkant also told Fox News 'I
 have confidence that they're going to do what’s right,' Vierkant said. 
'I just feel this should've happened a long time ago and it should've 
been public.'

Both Buetow and Vierkant told Fox they believe Bergdahl deserted his unit.
