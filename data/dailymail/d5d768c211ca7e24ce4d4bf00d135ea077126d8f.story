A seven-month-old girl who was born while her father was serving in Afghanistan has greeted him with an adorable sign.

'Hey I just met you and this is crazy, but my name's Harper and I'm your baby!' read the sign, referencing the hit song 'Call Me Maybe' by Carly Rae Jepsen.

Baby Harper Tesar held up the fluorescent pink message to meet her father, Army Specialist Cole Tesar, as he returned home to Fort Polk, Louisiana on Sunday after a nine-month deployment.

He said that knowing he would get to see his daughter got him through his time abroad.

'Knowing that when it was all said and 
done, I would be with my family, I would be able to hold my baby for the
 first time,' he told WOWT.

And when he finally held her, it was worth the wait, he said.

'It is definitely special,' he said of holding his daughter. 'It is a pretty good feeling.'

A photograph shows the moment they met - with Cole smiling as he greets his daughter for the first time while she looks up at him, wide-eyed.

Until the meeting, Tesar had only seen his daughter via Skype calls, including following her birth.

His wife Logan said she was excited to have her husband back to help out.

'With ultrasounds and when I went into labor and doctor's appointments, it was hard not having him there,' she told WOWT.

The image of baby Harper was initially posted to the WOWT Facebook page, where it quickly became a hit and racked up more than 1.5 million 'likes'.

'I couldn't believe how fast it went viral like instantly,' Tesar said.

He said they were overwhelmed and thankful for the support and that he was now enjoying being back home and watching cartoons with his daughter.

After the image was posted to the internet, other parents began posting images of their children holding up signs welcoming their dads home.

'Move it!' one read. 'I've been waiting my whole life to meet my Daddy!'
