Drivers on a major highway in Virginia have been left dizzy by wiggly lines used to mark out lanes.

Motorists driving on Interstate 66 in Fairfax County, Virginia were forced to navigate their way through crooked lane lines on Monday morning during their rush hour commute.

Dozens of drivers complained to the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) which has now launched an investigation.

Confusing: Drivers were forced to navigate their way through the wiggly road lines on Interstate 66 in Virginia

Crooked: The problem took hold after pavement markings laid onto the eastbound stretch of highway between Centreville and Gainesville did not stick down properly

The problem took hold after temporary pavement markings were laid onto the eastbound stretch of highway between Centreville and Gainesville but did not stick down properly.

The haphazard markings had peeled off, lifted up and shifted around according to ABC 7.

Jeanette Schutte and her husband drove into Virginia from Lexington and had to snake through the crooked road markings on I-66.

She told ABC 7: ‘They were just all over the place and my husband was driving and he said thank God I know the roads!’

Repairs were underway on Tuesday by a sub-contractor affecting one lane and a shoulder on I-66.

Workmen ripped up the lines and tossed them to one side as they laid out new lines to try and fix the problem.

VDOT public affairs director Joan Morris said: ‘We apologize profusely to all the motorists who have been negotiating the very unsafe and messed up lanes right around Centreville on 66.’

‘We apologize for contributing to a lousy Monday morning on 66,' she added.

Thankfully, there were no road accidents or major delays due to the crooked lines.

Ms Morris said that the department would now conduct a thorough investigation to find out what happened.
