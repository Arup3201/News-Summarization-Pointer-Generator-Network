Getting a $2,000 tip as a waitress means hitting the jackpot.

Receiving it twice is almost unheard of.

But what happens if you despise the person leaving behind the cash and everything they stand for?

For Merritt Tierce, a recently published author and former waitress at upscale Dallas steakhouse Nick and Sam's, the answer was simple - you donate that money to a cause that person equally despised.

A few years ago Tierce twice waited on outspoken conservative radio announcer Rush Limbaugh, who left her $2,000 tips each time, once with 20 $100 bills.

But she didn't want to keep it.

'That was like blood money to me,' Tierce told The Dallas Morning News.

Tierce was the former executive director at the Texas Equal Access Fund, which provides money to women who can't afford to get abortions.

Limbaugh believes abortion is 'at the root of our cultural rot' and that 'we need the taxes of 52 million people that don't exist'.

Tierce said it felt right to her to give the money to the TEA Fund.

'It felt like laundering the money in a good way,' she told the newspaper.

'He's such an obvious target for any feminist or sane person.

'It was really bizarre to me that he gave me $2,000, and he's evil incarnate in some ways.'

Outspoken: Rush Limbaugh - pictured here in 1992 with then-President George Bush Sr. - is reputed for his controversial opinions, especially on feminism, African-Americans and capital punishment

Worthy casuse: Members of the Texas Equal Access abortion group. The fund provides financial assistance to low-income people who want an abortion and can't afford it

Debut: Merritt Tierce's first novel Love Me Back was recently released by Random House. It centers around a waitress at an upscale Dallas steakhouse on a downward spiral

Tierce's debut novel Love Me Back features fictionalized accounts of the hijinks that ensue at an upmarket steakhouse.

However encounters with a plus-size radio personality are surprisingly not included in the tome.

The book was recently published by Random House.

It follows the downward spiral of a waitress and single mother.
