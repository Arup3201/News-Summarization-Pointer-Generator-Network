A mother of two locked in a £11million divorce battle claims she is facing discrimination because she sacrificed her high-flying career to be a housewife.

Julia Hammans, 55, worked as a financial director for a major department store during the early years of her marriage to Nicholas Hammans.

When she became pregnant with their first child she agreed to give up her job to care for the family, the High Court heard yesterday.

Divorce battle: High-flying Julia Hammans (left), who gave up her career as a financial director to look after her children, is claiming a slice of her ex-husband Nicholas Hammans's (right) fortune

Mr Hammans, 54, went on to carve out a successful career and is now a multi-millionaire partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Last year he earned £800,000.

After the couple split up in 2004, Mrs Hammans was awarded the £1.75million six-bedroom Edwardian family home in Middlesex, as part of an interim divorce settlement.

But in March this year, Mr Justice Coleridge, sitting in the High Court Family Division, ordered her to sell the home to part-fund her living expenses.

She had sought a further £2.6million from her ex-husband, but the judge told Mr Hammans to pay only £400,000.

He ruled that she needed £80,000 a year, which she could generate largely herself from interest on her £1million in savings and by moving home. 

Family home: After a judge divided the family fortune - which Mrs Hammans values at £11million - she says her income is 10 times smaller than that of Mr Hammans, and she is being forced to sell her £1.75million home in Twickenham, Middlesex

Property: Mr Hammans also lives in a £1million-plus house in Twickenham (pictured), as well as enjoying a holiday home in Paris, and the court heard he earned £800,000 last year

At the Court of Appeal yesterday her lawyer, Patrick Chamberlayne QC, argued she should be given an extra £2.2million so she could keep her house.

He said: ‘It clearly is discriminatory that wives have to jump through these hurdles in order to qualify for a fair outcome.

1989: Mrs Hammans becomes pregnant and the couple 'agree' she will give up work.

2005: The couple divorce, Mrs Hammans is awarded the £1.75million family home, as part of a larger settlement.

March 2014: After Mrs Hammans requests a further £2.6million from her ex-husband, a the family judge at the High Court rules Mr Hammans should pay just £400,000.

He says the £400,000 sum, plus money from the sale of the house and interest on her £1million savings, would produce around £2million - giving her the £80,000-a-year he said she needed to live on.

October 2014: At the Court of Appeal, Mrs Hammans argues she deserves £2.2million, in addition to the £400,000, and should be free to keep her house. 

‘There ought to be an acknowledgement of what she has given up, but there has not been. Lip service is being paid to it, and she has to sell her house.

‘The judge provided no explanation of why he considered it appropriate for the wife to sell the home she received in the 2005 settlement. It was her family home and dear to her and was worth £1.75million.

‘Husband and wife are left in radically different positions by this judgement and that cannot be right.

‘This wife proved she had given up a well-paid lucrative career – that is enough.’ Mr Chamberlayne insisted the house was ‘a perfectly appropriate standard of accommodation for the wife to live in for the rest of her life, given the available assets in the case’.

Mrs Hammans was on the board of Dickins and Jones, which now trades as House of Fraser, and was earning a similar salary to her husband soon after they married in 1983.

Her barrister said her ex-husband’s career had in part taken off ‘through her investment, her sacrifice’. He added: The husband and wife started their careers at exactly the same time.

‘Both qualified as chartered accountants. She became pregnant in 1989 and, by agreement, gave up work to care for the family.

‘By this time she was a finance director of the Dickins and Jones Group with a seat on the board…earning the same as the husband.’ 

Court: Mrs Hammans is challenging what she says was an unfair division of marital wealth at the Court of Appeal, and is seeking a further £2.2million 

Mr Hammans has re-married and has two young children with his new wife, lives in a £1.5million house in the same part of Middlesex

She believes it is unfair she should be forced to sell the family home simply because her income is ten times smaller than that of her former husband.

The ex-couple had two children, who are now both grown up.

Mr Hammans, who has re-married and has two young children with his new wife, lives in a £1.5million house in the same part of Middlesex and has a holiday home in Paris.

Lord Justice Moore-Bick – sitting with Lord Justice Kitchin and Lord Justice Ryder – said: ‘It seems to me the wife is saying “I gave up my career. If I had not, I would have a lot of money in the bank and, post-divorce, would have been able to carry on with my career for the rest of my working life and live on the proceeds”.

‘When deciding what is fair, is it inappropriate to look at the consequences of giving up one’s career?’

Philip Marshall QC, acting for Mr Hammans, insisted his client’s ex-wife ‘has been properly and fairly treated’.

He agreed that it was important to ‘avoid discrimination by giving equal value to the contribution of the breadwinner and the homemaker’.

But Mr Marshall argued that Mr Justice Coleridge had taken Mrs Hammans’ loss of career earning into account by valuing her needs ‘generously’ at £80,000 a year.

He said that Mrs Hammans lived in a home with three reception rooms and six bedrooms by herself.

He insisted that a move to a £1.25million four-bedroom house in the same area ‘did not amount to a drop in her standard of living’.

The judges will give their ruling at a later date.
