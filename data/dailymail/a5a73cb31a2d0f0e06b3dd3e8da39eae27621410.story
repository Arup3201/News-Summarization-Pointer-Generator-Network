West Ham's Matt Jarvis on guitar, golf and playing for England... 

Who is your sporting hero? 

Ryan Giggs. I play in the same position, so I watched him a lot and liked the way he played and as I was growing up I’ve looked to mould my game on him, what he does and how he plays in that position.

What would you be if you weren’t a sportsman?

I honestly don’t know but I have thought about property, being in that business. But I think it would still have to be something in sport or sport-related as I don’t know what else I would like to be in.

Which other sportsman would you like to be?

I would be a golfer I think. They travel to the most amazing places and a lot of the time the sun is shining when you watch it, so you are thinking it would be great to play on these courses in this weather. A great career and a good chance to travel the world at the same time.

Due to his height, Jarvis said Tom Cruise (pictured) would be the idea person to play him in a film of his life 

Career highlight?

Playing for England. Don’t think there would be anything higher in the game than that. I am very proud to have achieved it and would love to again.

... AND the worst moment?

Getting relegated. It is a horrible thing and something I wouldn’t wish on my fellow professionals. It affects everyone at the club you are at when this happens.

If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save?

Other than my wife of course, it would have to be the dogs. We have three so I would make sure I got those out.

Favourite karaoke song?

I have a couple: Kings of Leon’s Use Somebody and Robbie Williams’s Angels. The second is a bit cringy, but you can really go for it as everyone sings it with you, so they can’t really hear your voice if it’s bad!

Three most-listened to songs on your ipod?

I have Ed Sheeran’s new album X, which I am really enjoying. I couldn’t pick out three songs, I am enjoying it all the way through. I’d recommend it, definitely.

Robbie William's Angels is Jarvis' go-to karaoke song along with Kings of Leon's Use Somebody 

Playing for England is the highlight of Jarvis' career and he would love it to happen again 

The last book Jarvis read was former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography

Last book you read?

It was Sir Alex Ferguson’s autobiography. It was a very good read, very interesting.

Last film you saw?

Gone Girl — had heard it was very good, and it was worth seeing.

Can you cook? Best dish?

I can cook — my signature dish would have to be spaghetti bolognese. I am better at following instructions than making my own meals or recipe.

In a film of your life, who would YOU like to play you?

It’s an easy one this because everyone batters me for my height, so I would say Tom Cruise. But look at all the films he has done, so not a bad choice"! 

Tell us a secret...

I used to play the guitar when I was really young. I haven’t played in years so think I would have lost the art by now, but it is something people wouldn’t have known about me.
