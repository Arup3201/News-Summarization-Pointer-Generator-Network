A woman leaped nearly 200ft to her death from an office block after believing she had flunked an interview for a factory job in central China.

Victim Hu Tai, 27, climbed out of the 17th floor window in Zhengzhou, a city in central China's Henan province, after her interviewers told her they would call her in a few days to tell her their decision.

She  walked out of the interview room back to the waiting area, opened the window, and climbed out.

Desperation: A woman leapt nearly 200ft to her death from an office block after believing she had flunked an interview for a factory job in central China

Other interviewees told investigators she had hardly said a word to them while she was waiting for her turn but said she had travelled more than 100 miles from the city of Anyang for the chance of a job

Police say tragic Hu - a married mother with a four-year-old son - died instantly when she hit the ground below the tower block.

Other interviewees told investigators she had hardly said a word to them while she was waiting for her turn but she had told them she travelled more than 100 miles from the city of Anyang for the chance of a job.

One - identified as Mingmei Chou on local TV - said: 'She seemed very anxious and said how she really needed this job. Everything she owned was in a few bags in the lobby.'

Police say they believe Hu jumped when she was not immediately given a job by the factory owners conducting the interviews.

Police spokesman Jin Wan said: 'There were 20 people there all applying for the same jobs. We believe she felt she had failed and made a sudden decision to kill herself. But in fact we had not made a decision on any candidate yet.

'They were all very good including her and we wanted to take some time to review them again.'
