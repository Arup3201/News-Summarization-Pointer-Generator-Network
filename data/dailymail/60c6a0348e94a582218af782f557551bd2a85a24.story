Discarded Kevin Pietersen continues to haunt the England team despite playing his last Test match in Sydney seven months ago.

Publishers Sphere chose to announce the launch of KP’s autobiography next October, during the first Test against India at Trent Bridge. Sphere requested media wanting to interview Pietersen to contact them already despite the length of time before the book appears.

Meanwhile, such is the interest in Pietersen that rival publishers Simon & Schuster are bringing out an unofficial biography written by Sunday Times cricket correspondent Simon Wilde, which will be in the bookshops next week.

Hanging around like Banquo's ghost: The spectre of Kevin Pietersen continues to haunt this England team

Wilde,
 surprisingly sympathetic to Pietersen, reserves most criticism for the 
‘amateurish’ way England managing director Paul Downton went about 
explaining the reasons for KP’s exile.

However
 the ripostes from KP’s preposterous  flagwaver Piers Morgan, who 
described England’s boss as ‘Downton Shabby’ on Twitter, hit home hard 
enough for Downton, encouraged by wife Ali, to confront Morgan at Lord’s
 earlier this summer.

Graeme
 Swann was so supportive of Pietersen in his newspaper columns 
during the Ashes that former England team director Andy Flower phoned 
him to complain.

Yet perhaps Swann’s truer opinion of Pietersen can be 
gauged from his enthusiastic high five greeting to Andrew Strauss on the
 first day of the India Test.

Swann had not seen Strauss since he 
called Pietersen a ‘complete ****’ while believing he was off air, 
commentating on the MCC v Rest of the World match at Lord’s. Swann was 
not the only one to support Strauss’s opinion as the ex- England captain
 frequently had his hand shaken at Trent Bridge.

The
 owners of Test Match Sofa, the irreverent ball-by-ball commentary that 
has hugely upset BBC rights holders Test Match Special, are  
considering legal action against the ECB on anti-competitive grounds. 
The Sofa output has been off air since the Ashes as The Cricketer 
magazine, who own the concept, consider their next legal step. 
Meanwhile, The Cricketer’s staff are having to apply for their own jobs 
as owners, who include former Leicestershire chairman Neil Davidson, 
look at extending outsourcing the content from 70 per cent to 100 per 
cent.

Football agent Phil 
Smith, who received a six-month ban for breaches of third party 
ownership in the transfer of Matt Phillips from Wycombe to Blackpool, 
has had the suspension he described as ‘completely out of proportion’ 
reduced on appeal to seven weeks with a £15,000 fine. It allows Smith to
 participate immediately in transfer activity. He said: ‘I was given a 
very fair hearing on a convoluted case.’

British businessman Ray Whelan was said by Brazilian police to be a fugitive after they attempted to re-arrest him in connection with the Operation Jules Rimet crackdown on World Cup ticket sale abuse.

Whelan was not present when police arrived at his Rio hotel and they claim he was filmed by hotel security leaving through a back door.

Ian Ward, who played five Tests for England, is highly rated by Sky Sports 
as a reporter whose pertinent questions get the best response from the 
players.

Yet Ward somehow evaded asking Stuart Broad, who was put up by 
England at the end of play to speak to the media, about the 
continued poor form of captain Alastair Cook — the major issue of the 
first Test against India. 

Ward, after gentle banter with Broad about 
bowling so many overs on an unresponsive pitch, said ‘rest well’ rather 
than risk a contentious subject such as Cook’s form.

Out of sorts: It is now 26 innings since Alastair Cook hit a Test century
