They look suspiciously fresh; but in fact these lumps of dung are around 100,000 years old.

They came from a giant ground sloth (Eremotherium rusconi), an ancient relative of modern tree sloths, armadillos and anteaters.

The grizzly bear-sized animals used foot-long claws to grasp tree limbs and scrape off bark for meals - as scientists know from studying their fossilised dung, or 'coprolites'.

The Pleistocene is the geological epoch which lasted from about 2.58million to 11,700 years ago, spanning the last ice age.

The modern continents were essentially at their present positions during the Pleistocene, the plates upon which they sit probably having moved no more than 100 km relative to each other since the beginning of the period.

The climate of the era was marked by repeated glacial cycles where glaciers pushed to the 40th parallel in some places. It is estimated that, at maximum glacial extent, 30 per cent of the Earth's surface was covered by ice.

During this period marine and continental faunas were essentially modern although many animals, specifically, mammals were much larger than their modern relatives.

A major extinction event of large mammals (megafauna), which included mammoths, mastodons, saber-toothed cats (like the one pictured above right), glyptodons, ground sloths, Irish elk, cave bears, and short-faced bears, began late in the Pleistocene and Neanderthals also became extinct during this period.

During the Pleistocene Epoch (2.58million years ago â€“ 12,000 years ago) giant ground sloths lived 
over much of North and South America.

They stood 20ft (7m) tall on their hind legs to get food from trees, but were otherwise rather slow-moving quadrupeds.

Conditions are sometimes so dry their dung can be preserved for thousands of years with little deterioration or change.

These specimens where collected in April 1941 by Smithsonian Curator Remington Kellogg at Rampart Cave in the Grand Canyon.

Scientists have estimated them at around 100,000 years old. Fossil evidence of giant ground sloths was first uncovered in 1840 by Richard Owen, but complete skeletons are rare.
