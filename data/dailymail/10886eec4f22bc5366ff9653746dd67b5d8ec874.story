Mona Lisa Tello, 61, allegedly handed in the forged letter to get more than a dozen days off work but suspicions were raised when officials spotted a series of misspellings

A teacher faked a jury duty letter to bunk off school but was caught out by her atrocious spelling, it is claimed.

Mona Lisa Tello, 61, allegedly handed in the forged letter to get more than a dozen days off work but suspicions were raised when officials spotted a series of misspellings including 'trail' instead of 'trial', 'sited' instead of 'cited' and 'manger' instead of 'manager'.

The New York science teacher, who was paid $76,000 a year, also allegedly put the wrong address on the letter and included fake bar codes and bogus fax and telephone numbers.

Tello, who has been teaching for 13 years, has now agreed to retire from the High School of Graphic Communication Arts in Manhattan as of January 15.

She also has to reimburse the city $3,374 for the salary she was paid while playing truant, according to court records, reports the New York Daily News.

However Tello, who was recruited from Puerto Rico to teach children with Spanish as their first language, is now facing three charges of forgery.

Prosecutors claim she used jury duty as an excuse for 15 absences between September 2010 and May 2011.

The probe first began in June 2011 when Principal Jerod Resnick became suspicious and together with Richard Condon, the school system’s Special Commissioner of Investigatio,n filed a complaint against her.

After spotting the spelling mistakes, Mr Resnick had checked the letter supposedly from the Hudson County Superior Court in New Jersey with a court official, according to the Daily News.

The courts then forwarded him a copy of the letter it had actually sent Tello informing her that 'her request to have jury service deferred had been approved and her new appearance date was Sept. 14, 2011'.

Tello had claimed to be on jury duty while she bunked offl from the High School of Graphic Communication Arts (pictured) for five days in 2010 and on 10 other days last year, officials told the Daily News

Tello had claimed to be on jury duty 
while she cut school for five days in 2010 and on 10 other days last 
year, officials told the Daily News.

'It is the recommendation of this office that Mona Lisa Tello’s employment be terminated,' Mr Condon wrote in an August 31 letter, reports the Daily News.

Tello was one of a dozen bilingual science teachers who were recruited from Puerto Rico in 1993. 

Her first job was teaching biology at the High School for Humanities in Manhattan.

She was arraigned on Monday and released without bail until her next court date in March, according to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office.

Tello refused to comment when the Daily News contacted her by telephone.
