A backyard cabin owned by a lottery millionaire is set to be destroyed in a council crackdown on 'beds in sheds' landlords - despite him insisting it is used for parties.  

George Traykov, a former member of the Bulgarian skydiving team, who has scooped more than £1.1million in EuroMillions wins, was investigated by Hounslow council for allegedly renting out unauthorised dwellings.

Council officers raided the £290,000 property in Feltham, south west London, last week and have now obtained a demolition order. 

They say the building, which has a kitchen and central heating, was among a number of beds in sheds being rented out for up to £200-a-week.

Mr Traykov, who has lived in the UK for about 20 years, denies he acted illegally and said the house was used merely for 'storage and parties'.

Mr Traykov was also ordered to stop using a shed as a residential dwelling at a separate property by Harrow council earlier this year.

He was investigation by council staff after the cabin - which had a kitchen, toilet and bedroom - was discovered. 

It was detected after officials used an aircraft equipped with a thermal camera to fly over the borough to pinpoint the illegal structures. 

Speaking to the London Evening Standard at the £350,000 home in Ilford where he lives with his 20-year-old fiancée Emilia Vazheva, Mr Traykov, 47, said of last week's raid: 'My relatives are living in the house while it is being renovated. They are not paying rent.

'The outbuilding has been there since I bought it. This is not a living area where people live and sleep. I had parties there, I had gatherings there, it is a playroom. I use it for storage. 

'The council assumes something and they raid the property. No one has come to me to ask me.' 

The former member of the Bulgarian skydiving team beat odds of one-in-438 million when he picked up a £160,873 EuroMillions prize in 2013 to add to the £1million sum he won in the Millionaire Raffle in 2011

Neighbours said they had made repeated complaints about Eastern European immigrants living in the shed and the most recent occupants were a couple with a young child. 

Steve Curran, Leader of Hounslow council, told the Evening Standard: 'We will be remorseless in our war on rogue landlords who are exploiting some of the most vulnerable people in London.'

Last week's operation is one of a series of crackdowns. Last month Hounslow council officers discovered up to 40 illegally converted beds in sheds, housing over 70 tenants — including four suspected illegal immigrants.
