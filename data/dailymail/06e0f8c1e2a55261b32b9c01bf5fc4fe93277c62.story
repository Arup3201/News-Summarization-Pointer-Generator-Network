The body of an Arizona teenager missing since last week was found Monday evening near the spot where his SUV was abandoned in a wooded area, a southern Oregon sheriff's office said.

Johnathan Croom's parents said he was 'obsessed' by the 2007 film 'Into the Wild' and he had recently told his friend that he wanted to run away.

His body was discovered dead about 1,000 feet from his vehicle, Douglas County sheriff's spokesman Dwes Hutson said in a statement. It is being investigated as a suicide.

Body found: Jonathan Croom's body was found on Monday after he vanished as he drove from Seattle to Arizona earlier this month

Tragic: The 18-year-old was due to begin college classes last Monday but failed to turn up

'This was a kid who was obsessed with the movie,' David Croom told KVAL.com before his son's body was discovered. 'My concern is he is up there with very limited resources, and no experience.'

Croom's SUV was found Wednesday in 
Riddle, a town of 1,200 people just off the state's main north-south 
thoroughfare, Interstate 5.

His
mother has said he was traveling alone and on his way back from 
Seattle, where he visited a friend. Croom was due in Arizona on August 
17 to start college in Mesa.

Hutson had said that text messages between Croom and a friend indicated Croom wanted to run away.

Croom
also talked to his parents about Christopher McCandless, whose journey 
to Alaska was documented in the book and subsequent movie named 'Into 
the Wild.' McCandless gave up his worldly goods to live in the Alaska 
wilderness, only to die there, perhaps from eating wild potatoes.

'I
think we have kind of a combination there,' Hutson said earlier Monday.
'He talked with his parents about 'Into the Wild,' and in text messages
we've looked at, he does specifically talk about running away, kind of 
just running away from his life.'

The discovery of the teen's body comes after his abandoned car was found last week.Â 

Copycat? The film, which stars Emile Hirsh, charts the experiences of a college graduate seeking adventure and a simpler life. He travels across the U.S. with few provisions and without contacting his family

Adventurous: The 2007 film is based on the real-life experiences of Chris McCandless, pictured, who was found dead in the Alaska wilderness in 1992 when he was just 24

Croom
left a friend's home in Seattle on August 16 and was driving home to 
Arizona, but he failed to turn up to his first classes at Mesa Community
College last Monday.

His abandoned SUV was found in Riddle, southwest Oregon close to Interstate 5 on Wednesday. Inside the SUV were Jonathan's wallet, $200 in cash and a book on outdoor survival tactics.

'Just as in that movie, he left everything behind and took off,' David Croom said early Monday. 'And we just don't know what he left with.'

His family said they are worried that he was inspired by the McCandless' sad story.

McCandless
headed to the wild with no money and few provisions in a bid to live 
simply and appreciate nature. He was found dead in August 1992, when he 
was just 24.

Croom's father David said the teenager had hinted that he was attracted to the same adventure.

'He was talking to another friend that it
would be great to just leave penniless and just work along the way and 
get resources like they did in the movie,' he told MyFoxPhoenix.com.

A friend told the family that their son might have planned the trip.

'She said "he had left to go on an adventure and I haven't been able to get ahold of him for two days",' Mr Croom said.

'As far as we know he left in shorts 
and a T-shirt and a backpack with some socks in it and he left the car 
and that's all we know.'

His mother Monica added that her son was 'super smart' and had Boy Scout experience.

She added that his SUV didn't 
break down, wasn't out of gas and was unlocked with money inside. Officers added that the vehicle had not been broken into.

Search teams scoured the area for clues to his whereabouts but it wasn't until Monday that they came across the body.

Johnathan had visited a female friend but failed to
return home. He had originally left Arizona on July 30.

On his blog earlier this year, he described himself as someone looking for excitement and adventure.

Sad: On his blog, Croom said he wanted to live an exciting life so he could teach others how to do so

'I am definitely searching for my purpose in the world and writing about Life,' he wrote. 'I want to teach people to live 
extraordinarily unusual, fun, exhilarating lives. In order to do so, I 
need to be living the excitement myself.'

But he added in a post written in May: 'I do recognize that I make very bad decisions, quite often.

'These
decisions lead to a lot of remorse and unhappiness. I know I should 
just let these things go and push forward, as I'd recommend to anybody, 
but it's hard.

'I am trying though. I truly am... I will look back and see how far I've come and I will know that anything is possible.'

The teen's father had covered Oregon putting up missing posters in the hope someone would recognize his son.

'I'm just trying to stay busy and proactive and asking a lot of people to pray - that's my way of coping,' he said.
