A drunk driver who killed a teenager in a car crash early Friday morning in Council Bluffs, Iowa, refused to call police to report the incident.

So 16-year-old Jessilyn Eisman took away the 31-year-old's keys to make sure he didn't get off with the crime.

Hilberto Velasquez-Ramirez had a blood-alcohol level of .178 - twice the legal limit - when he was driving the wrong way on Veterans Memorial Highway and coming straight at a Chevy Cavalier with four teenage passengers.

You're not going anywhere: 16-year-old Jessilyn Eisman, left, took the keys away from drunk driver 31-year-old Hilberto Velasquez-Ramirez, right, when he refused to call police to report the fatal crash he caused

The driver of the other car, 
18-year-old Brenden Kniesly swerved to avoid Velasquez-Ramirez, but 
their vehicle was still side-swiped by the drunk driver's van.

17-year-old Chrishaun Moten was sitting behind the driver and was killed in the crash.

Jessilyn Eisman, 16, crawled from the wreckage of her friend's car and yelled to Velasquez-Ramirez, asking him to call 911.Â 

When he refused she took his key's so he couldn't get away.

One dead: 17-year-old Chrishaun Moten was sitting behind the driver and got the brunt of the force from the crash, which killed him

The damage: Two other passengers in the car on the left were taken to the hospital for their injuries

Drunk: Velasquez-Ramirez recorded a blood-alcohol level twice the legal limit after the crash and admitted to drinking six beers. Another pack of beer was found in his car

'I wasn't going to let someone leave that just killed my friend,' she said.

Eisman flagged down another driver to call for help.

While
Eisman suffered only minor injuries,the two other teenagers injured in 
the crash were taken to the hospital. Driver Kniesly was in stable 
condition at Council Bluffs hospital Saturday while 17-year-old Philip 
Moffatt was seriously injured and improving at Omaha hospital, according
to police.

Fatal: The crash killed 17-year-old Chrishaun Moten, left. His friend Jessilyn Eisman, with Moten on the right, stopped the drunk driver who killed him from getting away

Velasquez-Ramirez
was arrested on suspicion of homicide by vehicle, two counts of serious
injury by vehicle, operating while intoxicated and having no driver's 
license or proof of insurance. He is being detained at the Pottawattamie
County Jail on $65,000 bail.

Even
if Velasquez-Ramirez were to make bail, he still wouldn't be able to 
leave because he is currently under a hold by immigration who are 
looking into his citizenship status.

Injured: 18-year-old Brenden Kniesly, above, was treated at Council Bluffs hospital, and 17-year-old Philip Moffatt was taken to Omaha hospital

In
a jail interview, Velasquez-Ramirez said the crash was not his fault. 
Through an interpreter, he said that the other driver swerved which 
caused the crash - though he does admit to consuming six beers before 
the crash.

Velasquez-Ramirez is from Nashville, Tennessee, and was in Iowa to do roofing work.
