Who would deface a dead whale with graffiti?

That is the question that officials in New Jersey were trying to answer after a dead 15-foot-whale that washed up in Atlantic City was found Thursday morning spray-painted purple.

Police say the markings are not gang-related and appear to be Greek letters.

The symbols were Tau Epsilon Phi - the name of a fraternity that has chapters at several area schools - followed by what looked like '94.'

Clue: Tau Epsilon Phi is a national fraternity that has chapters at several area schools

Bob Schoelkopf, of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center, told The Press of Atlantic City the whale appeared to have been dead for several days and washed up during a strong storm. It had no sign of trauma.

A state pathologist will try to determine the cause of death.

Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the deceased marine mammal was discovered at around 8am under the Central Pier with its white underbelly covered in purple markings linking the tagged ocean critter to Tau Epsilon Phi.

The century-old fraternity has 14 active chapters, including at Rowan University, University of Pennsylvania and Rutgers Camden.

MailOnline reached out to the national offices of Tau Epsilon Phi for comment Friday afternoon, but have yet to receive a response.

Final resting place: The tagged whale, pictured alongside a common dolphin that also washed up on the beach, was eventually dragged to the Boardwalk for burial

After several chunks of the dead whale's carcass were carved up for examination, the mammal was dragged with chains and heavy machinery from the pier for burial.

The defaced whale was laid to rest in eight feet of sand near the Boardwalk, raising concerns among some local business owners that the decomposing remains would spread foul odor in the summer heat.

A common dolphin also washed up dead along the beach seven blocks away from the whale.

Minke whales are common in the North Atlantic. Their weight could reach up to 20,000lbs, and adult animals could grow to be 35feet in length. Some whales live to be 50 years old.
