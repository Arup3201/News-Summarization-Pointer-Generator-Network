Couple: Andrew Mitchell arriving at the High Court yesterday with his wife Sharon Bennett

Sir Bob Geldof called the Tory MP at the centre of the Plebgate saga 'no slouch' when it comes to swearing, a libel trial heard yesterday.

Andrew Mitchell - whom the High Court heard is a ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ figure who has repeatedly demeaned police throughout his career - has admitted using a ‘mixture of charm and menace’ to keep MPs in line in his role as Chief Whip.

The MP is suing News Group Newspapers over the allegation that, after being refused entry through a Downing Street gate on his bike, he told officers: ‘Best you learn your f****** place ... you don’t run this f****** government, you’re f****** plebs.’ 

The court heard claims that Mr Mitchell had also made a habit of issuing profane and demeaning comments at police and security staff.

The court was also told that Sir Bob Geldof, who worked closely with Mr Mitchell when he was International Development Secretary, had provided a statement testifying to the MP’s use of profanity, while Tory peer Lord Coe agreed that his language was ‘fruity’.

The former Cabinet minister allegedly told a security guard at the Palace of Westminster to ‘stop being so aggressive, you little s***’ when he was reprimanded for cycling through Black Rod’s Gate in 2005. 

He is said to have added: ‘I’m an MP and I’m too important to stop for you.’ 

Mr Mitchell was also asked about an incident in Tunisia in 2011, when a member of his police protection team told him he could not cross into Libya. The MP reportedly told him: ‘That’s a bit above your pay grade, Mr Plod.’

The incidents were outlined on the first day of the latest legal proceedings relating to Plebgate.

Mr Mitchell denies calling officers 'f****** plebs', although he admits saying ‘I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us’ after officers refused to open the gate.

News Group Newspapers argues that its article in The Sun was substantially true. 

Toby Rowland, the police officer that Mr Mitchell reportedly called a ‘pleb’, is suing the MP for suggesting he made up the allegations.

The 58-year-old MP was forced to resign a month after the controversy erupted in 2012, following an ‘extraordinary tsunami of vitriol’.

James Price, QC, acting for the MP, told the court the allegations against his client were a ‘web of lies’ and accused the police of ‘deceit and indiscipline’.

However, Desmond Browne QC, for Mr Rowland, said many officers had seen ‘Mr Hyde and not Mr Jekyll’.

‘Doubtless he is charming to the officers in his constituency station at Sutton Coldfield when he goes to visit them at Christmas,’ he said, before warning that police in Downing Street ‘have seen the other side of his character – his capacity for menace’.

The court were told that the MP shouted ‘chop chop’ to one officer while they opened Downing Street gates on a separate occasion. 

He was also said to have launched a ‘foul-mouthed tirade’ at his protection detail when a journey was delayed at the last minute.

On the night before the Plebgate incident, he is said to have told Downing Street police: ‘I am the Government Chief Whip and I want to be allowed through the vehicle gate.’ 

Mr Mitchell said he could not recall any of these outbursts. 

Giving evidence under oath yesterday, Mr Mitchell denied ever calling a police officer a pleb.

During a testy cross-examination, the MP said: ‘I do not deny I have a temper sometimes, but I do deny I am quick to lose it.

‘I am capable of using bad language, I use it too much. I also admit that I can sometimes be impatient and short-tempered when I consider I am being prevented from going about my legitimate business.

'I even admit that I can be, or at least that I can appear to be, rude on these occasions. 

'To the best of my recollection, I have never called anybody a pleb, let alone a policeman.

‘Since the incident I have thought long and hard about this and cannot recall a single instance when I have called anybody a pleb. It just isn’t a word I use.’

He added: ‘From a political angle, it was the word pleb that was dynamite. I was horrified at this wholly untrue allegation.’

Mr Price said Mr Mitchell was ‘a good man’, adding: ‘In the end the lies brought Mr Mitchell down, destroying a political career of 27 years.’

The Plebgate saga has led to the conviction of one officer for misconduct in public office and the dismissal of three others.

Mr Price said the Police Federation, funded mainly by police officer subscriptions - which is supporting Mr Rowland - has already spent £1million  in legal costs.

The case continues.
