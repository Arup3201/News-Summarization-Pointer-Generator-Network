Jamie Carragher will bring the curtain down on his illustrious Liverpool career after revealing today he will retire from football at the end of this season.

The former England defender, who has made 723 appearances for Liverpool since making his debut in January 1997, issued a statement today on his club’s official website in a bid to end speculation about his future plans.

Carragher has five months remaining on 
his contract and his recent performances away against Arsenal and 
Manchester City have prompted discussions about whether he should be 
given a new one-year deal.

But the 35-year-old believes the time is right to end his playing career and he will be leaving Anfield for good – no talks have taken place about him joining Liverpool’s coaching staff and none are planned.

In a statement Carragher told liverpoolfc.com: 'This will be my last season at Liverpool and my last as a professional footballer.

'I'm making this announcement now because I don't want the manager or the club to be answering questions on my future when I've already decided what I am going to do.

'I will be fully committed between now and the end of the season to doing the very best for Liverpool Football Club, as I've done my entire career since joining aged just nine years old.

Fowler ‏Part II'And knowing carra, he won't want a big fuss.... But you know what, he deserves one of the biggest.. #23'

Former England and Liverpool team-mate Michael Owen ‏'What a servant Carra has been for Liverpool. A rare breed and it's been a privilege to play alongside, room with and be big mates with one of footballs real men. I doubt we have heard the last of him. He has too much to offer the game to be away for long!'

Ex-coach Phil Thompson ‏'Carra retiring, what a legend and what a wonderful servant to our great club, we won't see the likes of him again. RESPECT MATE'

Ex-team-mate Didi Hamann'Just heard that Carra retires at the end of the season. One of the all time great LFC players, he showed in the last few weeks he still got it'

Host of MOTD Gary Lineker 'Carragher will hang up his boots at the end of the season. Those boots were worn by a player respected by everyone in the game.'

'It has been a privilege and an 
honour to represent this great club for as long as I have and I am 
immensely proud to have done so and thankful for all the support I have 
had. There are many memories I want to share and people to thank, but 
now is not the time for that.

'I won't be making any further 
comment on this decision until the end of the season; all our focus and 
concentration should be on achieving the best possible finish in the 
league this season and trying to win the last remaining trophy we are 
competing in.'

Roy Evans launched Carragher’s career
 when he used him as a substitute during a League Cup quarter-final 
against Middlesbrough 16 years ago and, in the time since, he has won 
every major honour bar the Barclays Premier League and now sits second 
in the club’s all-time appearance list, behind Ian Callaghan.

Though Carragher has played 24 times 
this season for Brendan Rodgers, only four of those games have been from
 the start in the Premier League and he explained recently that making 
that adjustment has been difficult.

‘I said I wouldn’t complain and I’m just trying to get more starts between now and the end of the season,’ he said after Liverpool beat Norwich 5-0 on January 19.

‘I’ve played a lot in Europe and the cups but the Premier League is the most important thing for the club and the players.

‘We all want to play in it and I’m no different. I won’t lie, it’s been a difficult season for me in terms of starting games.’

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, 
whose side face West Brom at home on Monday, said: 'Jamie has been 
absolutely outstanding for me since I joined the club. He has been a 
model professional on and off the pitch and has shown an unswerving 
commitment to our work.

'We
 still have a lot to play for as we look to finish as high up the 
Barclays Premier League as possible and continue our progression in the 
Europa League, a competition we'd like to win.

'He will have a significant role to play
 for us between now and May and I know his commitment and dedication on 
the pitch will remain as it has done his entire career at Liverpool.

'Jamie's focus is always on doing what 
is best for the team and he has said he doesn't want any distractions 
while there are still important matches to be played and won.

'But when the time is right we, as a team and a club, will give the man the tribute and recognition he deserves; I know the supporters will want to say thank you to someone who has served them with such distinction for so long.'

And Roy Hodgson paid tribute to the 'model professional', backing him to be among the coaching ranks soon.

'Having worked with Jamie Carragher, it was always evident that he was a model professional who gave everything he had for club and country,' said the England boss, who had a brief spell at Anfield in 2010.

'He has had a fantastic career and will always be looked on very fondly by everyone associated with Liverpool Football Club.

'It was good to see him back in the team recently. I hope that between now and the end of the season he is able to add to his great total of appearances for the club.

'After retirement, I am sure he will march quickly up the coaching ladder and become one of the country's top young coaches.'

Liverpool managing director also heaped praise on the 2005 European champion, adding: 'It
 speaks volumes about Jamie's selfless nature that even the manner of 
this announcement is putting the team and the club before himself. It's 
what he's done throughout his entire career.

'He told me he didn't want the manager 
or myself fending off questions regarding his future when he had already
 made his decision. Jamie's focus, like ours, is on finishing the season
 as strongly as possible.

'Everyone within the game knows that 
Jamie Carragher has been a colossal figure for Liverpool Football Club. 
You don't have a career spanning three decades at the very top of this 
game unless you are an exceptional player and what's more, he epitomises
 the values this club was built on and continues to stand for.

'In line with Jamie's wishes we will wait until the season concludes before giving him the true recognition he deserves. We will also wait until that time to comment further regarding what involvement he may have with the club going forward.'

England boss Roy Hodgson, who has worked with Carragher at Anfield, also praised the departing defender.

He said: 'Having worked with Jamie Carragher it was always evident that he was a model professional who gave everything he had for club and country,” said Hodgson.

'He has had a fantastic career and will always be looked on very fondly by everyone associated with Liverpool Football Club.

'It was good to see him back in the team recently, I hope that between now and the end of the season he is able to add to his great total of appearances for the club.

'After retirement I am sure he will march quickly up the coaching ladder and become one of the country’s top young coaches.'

Sportsmail columnist and former team-mate of Carragher, Jamie Redknapp, described the Liverpool defender as an 'icon of the Premier League'.

'People always talk about you being a long time retired, but Jamie must know it's the right time to do it for his family and we have to respect that,' Redknapp said.

'Jamie's been thinking about this for a while now and his career and when is the right time to decide. The career that he's had, he's an absolute icon of the Premier League and for Liverpool and they are going to miss him.

'Only Jamie knows his body. He's the only person who knows what it's like day-in, day-out, how he recovers after a game. He'll be looking at it and think the right time is the end of the season and then he will look at his options.

'Maybe management, in the media - when he did the World Cup coverage he was exceptional. He's a real student of the game and watches every single football match on television so that's something he might want to do. He has many, many options.

Speaking to Sky Sports News, Redknapp added: 'He's worked so hard at his game and the extra training he did behind the scenes and in the gym. The young players now look at all the trimmings but he is a good person to analyse for the dedication he's put in and the rewards he's got now.

'He won't want any fuss whatsoever, that's the last thing he likes. Brendan Rodgers will know he will get him 100 per cent until the end of the season.'
