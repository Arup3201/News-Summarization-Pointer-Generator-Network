Move over Mark Cuban. Another Silicon Valley whiz kid is entering the league of extraordinary gentlemen who own NBA teams.

The National Basketball Association  board of governors has approved the sale of the Memphis Grizzlies to 34-year-old Robert Pera, in a deal reportedly worth $350 million.

New kid on the block: 34-year-old Robert Pera is now the youngest owner of an NBA team

Pera, a former engineer at Apple, is CEO of Ubiquiti Networks and with a net worth estimated at $1.5 billion - he was ranked as tenth on Forbes Magazine's list of Youngest Billionaires in the World.

Pera actually reached an agreement with the team's owner, 75-year-old Michael Heisley, to purchase the NBA franchise in June. 

'I think he'll be a good owner. He's young. He's in his 30s. I think he 
loves basketball. And I think he's financially very well off. I think 
he'll be an excellent owner,' Heisley told FOX Sports during the 
summer.

But before Pera could be installed as the new owner, the deal needed approval from the league, which came on Thursday.

'We are delighted that the NBA's Board
of Governors has approved Robert Pera's purchase of the Grizzlies,' NBA
commissioner David Stern said in a statement.

'Robert
will no doubt bring great energy and passion to the franchise. He has 
assembled an ownership group with very strong local ties, and we 
anticipate that their commitment to the Memphis area will greatly 
benefit both the team and the community.'

Pera will have the majority stake among 
an ownership group of celebrities with ties to Memphis 
including NFL star Peyton Manning's wife Ashley, who is a native of 
Memphis, retired NBA player Anfernee 'Penny' Hardaway and singer Justin 
Timberlake.

Word had spread that Peyton Manning, a
native of New Orleans, was involved in the negotiations but it emerged 
that it was actually his wife who would be a partner.

'I
am proud of Ashley as she pursues this opportunity with the Memphis 
Grizzlies,' the NFL star said in a statement in early 
October. 

'While 
my focus is on playing quarterback for the Denver Broncos, I look 
forward to watching her become involved with her hometown team.'

Heisley
bought the team in 2000 and though he moved the franchise from 
Vancouver to Memphis in 2001, he wanted to ensure the team stayed put 
under new ownership.

The Grizzlies have a lease at the FedEx Forum arena until 2021.

Heisley decided to sell the team after health issues prevented him from traveling as frequently from his home base of Chicago to Memphis.

'It's such a long haul going back and forth down there ... I'm 75 years of age. I had a couple of medical problems this year (with his heart). I thought the team was in good shape. Fan base was in good shape. I thought if the opportunity presented itself, I would sell the team,' he told FOX Sports.

'It's very bittersweet, he added. 'I love Memphis ... I've spent a huge amount of money to make the team successful there. ... I did it because I love basketball and I love the city of Memphis and the people there and they've treated me fantastic. I have nothing but wonderful feelings.'

Pera won out against other interested
bidders, including Oracle founder Larry Ellison who was dismissed by 
Heisley because Ellison voiced his hopes of relocating the franchise.

'We're not even considering Ellison,' Heisley told the Memphis Commercial Appeal earlier in 2012. 'This team cannot be moved.'

Pera, who has a B.A. in Japanese 
Language, a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and an M.S. degree in 
Electrical Engineering from the University of California, San Diego, 
worked as a wireless engineer for Steve Jobs from January 2003 to 
February 2005. 

But at the age of 25, the aspiring 
entrepreneur left Apple to go out on his own and he founded Ubiquiti Networks, a San Jose based company that manufactures 
wireless products.

'Apple's a great company, but I realized I wanted to have more success faster,' he told Forbes magazine.

Pera owns a reported 64 per cent of Ubiquiti, a publicly-traded next-generation communications technology company.

He is a basketball fanatic and plays the game four to five times per week.

'I am excited about the opportunity to build on the work that has made the Memphis Grizzlies a highly competitive NBA team,' Pera said over the summer, when the deal was first reported.

'I look forward to getting to know the Memphis community and to continuing the team's success in Memphis.'

He will now be the youngest owner of an NBA team, with 54-year-old Mark Cuban, who owns the Dallas Mavericks, also among the youthful franchise heads.

The Grizzlies open the season Oct. 31 against the Los Angeles Clippers.
