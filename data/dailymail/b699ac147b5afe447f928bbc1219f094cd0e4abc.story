ISIS have clearly heard that an army marches on its stomach.

In a bid to keep their fighters well-nourished and ready for battle insurgents have launched their own cookbook.

Aimed at the wives of the jihadists the recipes are said to be made-up of simple ingredients that can be found in the homes of most militants.

The latest recipe is for pancakes and is made with egg, sugar, oil, salt, milk and flour, reported Vocativ.

Ingredients: four tablespoons of flour, one egg, teaspoon of salt and a cup of milk

The recipe instructs cooks to put all the ingredients in a bowl and stir them well

Cooks are then told to pour a little oil into the pan and warm to a medium hear, before pouring in the pancake mixture. When the pancake starts bubbling it should be flipped over

Once brown on both sides the pancake is ready to be served. Militants suggest dishing it up with maple syrup or honey

The instructions specify how the energy and calorie packed treats should be prepared and served.

It even suggests dishing them up with maple syrup and honey. 

The first instruction released were for 'date balls,' made by mixing dates, flour and butter together. 

Militants are told that the date balls are best eaten during an 'intermission in battle' with coffee or water.

'They contain significant calories, and will extend the power and strength of the Mujahideen, God willing,' the post says.  

The cookbook was published  by the Zora Foundation, an arm of ISIS that is seeking to recruit women to the cause, and give advice to those already in Syria and Iraq.

Their slogan is 'preparing for the honour of jihad' and their online accounts - which post only in Arabic - have attracted thousands of followers so far.  

The ingredients needed for power and strength increasing 'date balls' include dates, butter and flour

Terrorist wives  are told to take the pips out of the dates and melt the butter

Take the remains of the dates and add the butter.  Then combine with the flour

Cooks then need to role the mixture into the tiny balls before they are ready for their fighter husbands

ISIS strictly forbid women from taking part in combat, and so the propaganda films instead focus on how to assist jihad through 'feminine manual labour'.

Among the suitable tasks given to women is producing and editing slideshows and film footage, in an effort to make more propaganda, and participating in 'jihadi science' - which is not explained further.

It is not known exactly how many women have joined ISIS, but it is common for men signing up to take their wives to fight alongside them.

There are two all-female brigades operating in the de-facto capital of Raqqa, in Syria, including al-Khanssaa, which is thought to be lead by Aqsa Mahmood, 20, a British female jihadi.

The brigade, whose job is to patrol the streets of Raqqa enforcing strict Sharia law, is thought to include up to sixty female radicals from the UK. 

ISIS have published cartoon videos aimed at encouraging more women to join their cause
