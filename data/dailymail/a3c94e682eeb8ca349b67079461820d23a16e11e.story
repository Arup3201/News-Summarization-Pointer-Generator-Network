Dozens of disabled travelers have lodged complaints with Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport over invasive TSA checks that left them feeling violated and humiliated, according to records released this week.

One complaint involved an 82-year-old, wheelchair-bound woman who was allegedly asked to remove her prosthetic breast by a TSA agent in June 2012.

Some 26 complaints were made against the Arizona airport involving people with disabilities in 2012 - double the national average.

According to the Arizona Republic, the complaint filed on behalf of the 82-year-old woman read: 'At her age and physical capability, she posed absolutely no risk whatsoever to anyone’s safety and should not have been subjected to such invasive and (undignifed) treatment.

'This sort of degrading treatment is more appropriate for prisoners.'

Another breast cancer survivor said that a TSA agent ordered a pat-down of her prosthetic breast in a public area of the terminal.

The woman said that she was forced to reveal her breast 'in front of the world' and that the degrading experience 'ruined my vacation'. 

In a high-profile incident in March this year, a double amputee and Afghan War veteran, Marine Cpl Toran Gaal, was allegedly forced to remove his prosthetic legs and later had to stand on them without the use of his wheelchair.

The TSA has denied that this incident took place, saying that airport surveillance footage shows that the Marine's prosthetics were not removed. 

MailOnline was awaiting a response from Phoenix Airport regarding the high level of complaints.

In
 a statement to MailOnline, the TSA said: 'The Transportation Security 
Administration (TSA) strives to treat every passenger with dignity and 
respect. During the screening process, if an anomaly is detected, 
secondary screening is required to ensure the passenger does not have 
threat items, such as explosives concealed under clothing.

'A
 passenger should not be asked to remove or lift any article of clothing
 to reveal a sensitive body area or to remove a prosthetic.

'TSA
 works with numerous groups including breast cancer organizations to 
continuously refine and enhance our procedures to improve the passenger 
experience while also ensuring the safety of the traveling public.'

The TSA recommends on their website that disabled passengers and travelers with medical conditions call ahead to find out what they may face at the screening process.

According to the TSA website, if an agent feels that a pat-down is necessary as part of the screening process, then a private screening area can be requested at any time by the passenger. It also states that the option should be offered by the agent.

It is against TSA policy to ask a passenger to remove or lift any article of clothing to reveal a sensitive body area.
