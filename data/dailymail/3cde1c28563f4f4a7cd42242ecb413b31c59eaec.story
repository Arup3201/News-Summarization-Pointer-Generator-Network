A father with five daughters has spent $1.5 million paying for his girls' college education.

Marc Ostrofsky, an Internet tycoon and best-selling author, tallied up the bill after spending $60,000 to $70,000 on each child every year.

The entrepreneur, from Houston, will travel between three different states at opposite ends of the country this week to watch three of his daughters' graduation ceremonies.

High fliers: Mr Ostrofsky's five daughters will all attend colleges across the U.S.

He begins in North Carolina to watch Kelly, 22, graduated from Duke before heading back to Texas to see his youngest daughter, 18-year-old Mary Grace's high school graduation. She will go on to attend Boston University.

Along with his wife Beverley, he then flies to Washington University in St Louis to watch Shelly graduate.

Twins Shelly and Kelly took the advice of George W. Bush, also the father of twins Jenna and Barbara, when they decided to go to different schools during a meeting with the former president.

Jenna Bush attended the University of Texas while Barbara went to Yale.

Meanwhile another of Mr Ostrofsky's daughters Tracy, 20, is at the University of Denver and 23-year-old Maddy graduated last year from Berklee School of Music in Boston. 

The entrepreneur, from Houston, believes that in the future to be able to afford further education, students will follow a mixture of studies online and in the classroom.

He told KHOU-TV: 'I think in the future it is going to be different. Not a lot of people are going to play that game.'

Mr Ostrofsky made his millions in the telecoms and dot.com business along with starting and selling on magazines, trade shows and market research studies to earn a fortune.

He sold Business.com for $7.5 million which earned him the title of most expensive domain name ever sold in The Guinness Book of World Records.

He is also the bestselling author of Get Rich Click!: The Ultimate Guide to Making Money Online.

Mr Ostrofsky graduated from the University of Texas with a degree in business administration and marketing.

He beamed with pride when he told the local TV station about his daughters' achievements but when asked about the cost, added: 'Be careful what you wish for.'

And the pricey studies may not end there after daughter Kelly decided she may want to pursue a PHD.

According to FinAid.org in 2011, two-thirds of students graduating with four-year degrees were left with debt of around $23,186.
