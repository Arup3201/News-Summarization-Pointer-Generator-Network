NYPD officers will be given three days of training every year on how to use force after Eric Garner, 43, died after being placed in a chokehold

New York cops will be given  training on how to use force properly after a father-of-six died while being held in a chokehold by an off duty officer this summer.

Police will attend three days of classes each year where they will learn how to talk to the public, how to de-escalate tense situations and how to use force. At the moment, they are only given regular firearms training.

Eric Garner, 43, died after being restrained by an officer who accused him of selling untaxed cigarettes. 

A video of the arrest shows Mr Garner struggling on the pavement, saying 'I can't breathe' before passing out.

The initiative is part of an effort to repair community relations and change the culture of the NYPD, Commissioner William Bratton said.

Three precincts will initially send their officers for the training in November, before the programme expands to include the 20,000 officers who regularly work patrol.

The department also recently began testing body-worn cameras in five precincts.

Mr Bratton said: 'I'm fully confident that through partnership and collaboration with the community, we can uphold the law, protect human life and ensure the safety of the police and the public alike.'

He added that at least $25million of funding will be needed for additional instructors and overtime to cover posts as officers are trained. 

Mr Bratton also plans to put rookie officers in precincts with mentors, instead of funneling them into high-crime areas right out of the academy, so they can learn  how to police correctly.

To do this, Bratton said, the NYPD will need at least 1,000 new recruits. There are currently around 35,000 officers, compared to the nation's second-largest department, Chicago, which has 13,000.

Only a few months ago, Mr Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio said they didn't need more officers.

City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, who had suggested more officers were necessary, said the council would work to give police 'the resources they need to serve New Yorkers.'

A Grand Jury is currently reviewing the death of Eric Garner. Mr Garner, a black man, died after a white police officer placed him into a chokehold - a move prohibited by the NYPD, but not illegal.

A video of the arrest, shot by a passerby on his mobile, showed Mr Garner struggling on the ground before passing out. In the seven minutes it took for an ambulance to arrive, nobody performed CPR.

The death, which came around the same time as the shooting of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked weeks of protests demanding justice

New York cops are also testing new body cameras in order to help rebuild relations with the community

The state medical examiner ruled the July 17 death was a homicide, saying Mr Garner was killed by 'the compression of his chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police.'

The death, along with the shooting of unarmed teenager Mike Brown in Missouri this summer, sparked weeks of protests with family and community members demanding justice.

The NYPD is currently under investigation for two restraint-related deaths. Ronald Singleton, 45, died after being arrested by officers while high on hallucinogenic drug PCP.

He suffered a cardiac arrest on the way to hospital on July 13. The state medical examiner's officer ruled the death a homicide, saying 'physical restrain by police' was a factor.
