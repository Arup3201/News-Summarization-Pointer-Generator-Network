Diabetic: Sophia Bhanji was taken to hospital with symptoms of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar

A diabetic woman died in the back of an ambulance after its lift broke down while outside a hospital - trapping her inside.

Sophia Bhanji was taken to Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow, north-west London, in the early hours of Wednesday morning with symptoms of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. 

But when she arrived at the accident and emergency unit, the tail lift of the ambulance she was travelling in stopped working. 

The fault meant paramedics were unable to move the trolley bed she was being treated on inside the hospital.

A number of doctors from the hospital worked for almost an hour in the back of the vehicle to resuscitate Miss Bhanji when she went into cardiac arrest, but they were unable to save her. 

Miss Bhanji's family are understood not to have been informed of the details surrounding her death before they were contacted by the Evening Standard this morning.

A family friend told the newspaper: 'They had their suspicions something was wrong, because she was being treated in the ambulance for a long time.

'Now they know there was a fault with the ambulance and they will want to know how this could have affected the treatment she received. 

'The uncertainty will add to their grief as they will want to know if she could have been saved.'

Writing on Facebook on Wednesday, her sister Rehanna said: 'Early hours of this morning I lost a part of my heart and life Sophia Bhanji passed away my big sister gone in heaven u r an angel I miss u so much.'

Friends quickly responded with heartfelt tributes to Sophia.  One posted: 'Missed Sophie so much today. It's going to be hard.' 

Another, writing on her other sister Rosemin's profile, said: 'Rest In Peace dear Sophia.'

Today the London Ambulance Service was unable to explain why Miss Bhanji was not carried out of the ambulance but said an investigation was under way. 

A spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that we were called just after 2.50am on 15 October to reports of a woman feeling unwell at Farm Avenue, Wembley.

'We sent an ambulance crew to the scene and the patient was taken to Northwick Park Hospital as a priority.

'Our ambulance crew, along with staff from Northwick Park Hospital, made every effort to resuscitate the patient but sadly she died.

'We are aware that there was an issue with the tail lift and we are looking into the circumstances of what happened.'

The five-year-old Mercedes Sprinter, normally stationed at the North Kensington ambulance station, has been taken out of service.  

It is not known whether Miss Bhanji was a Type 1 or Type 2 diabetic.
