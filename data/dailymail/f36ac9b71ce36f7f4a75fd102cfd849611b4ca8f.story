Architects have used a 3D printer to create an intricately decorated room that looks a little like the interior of a cathedral.

Creative duo Michael Hansmeyer and Benjamin Dillenburger made the grand space called 'Digital Grotesque' that measures 16 square metres and has an incredible 260 million facets.

They said the project aims to create architecture that 'defies classification and reductionism' as well as straddling chaos and order and the natural and artificial to produce a space that is 'neither foreign nor familiar'.

They said the project aims to create architecture that 'defies classification and reductionism' as well as straddling chaos and order and the natural and artificial to produce a space that is 'neither foreign nor familiar'

'Any references to nature or existing styles are not integrated into the design process, but are evoked only as associations in the eye of the beholder,' they wrote on their website.

The pair used algorithms to create the building, which while carefully designed, did not necessarily produce an 'entirely foreseeable result' according to the architects.

They think the 3D printing process can make surprising results that go beyond what could have have been conceived using traditional design techniques.

The architectural project, which claims to be the first of its kind to use 3D printing, did not set out to make a functional space but instead to explore the 'expressive formal potentials of digital technologies' as well as the lavish and exciting spaces they can create.

While architects have recently used pen and paper or a CAD program to design a form, the pair believe 3D printing makes the design process allows a new level of complexity and detail that was impossible to imagine before and 'bits and bytes can be rendered directly into reality'.

Mr Hansmeyer and Mr Dillenburger said: 'The combination of computational design and additive manufacturing can lead to a non-standardised, highly differentiated and spatially complex architecture that is defined at the scale of millimeters.'

In the Digital Grotesque project, the room was crafted from 3D printed sandstone and effectively formed of two halves that make up the grotto.The designers invented a modular system of large prefabricated sandstone bricks (pictured) to build the room, to enable its construction by hand

In the Digital Grotesque project, the room was crafted from 3D printed sandstone and effectively formed of two halves that make up the grotto.

The designers invented a modular system of six large prefabricated sandstone bricks to build the room, to enable its construction by hand.

It was designed and detailed solely using algorithms and then printed at a resolution of a tenth of a millimeter.

The room (pictured here in gold) was designed and detailed solely using algorithms and then printed at a resolution of a tenth of a millimeter. Every detail is generated though algorithms without any human intervention, which creates a geometric mesh of 260 million individually specified facets

This single 3D printing process generated the overall form of the room as well as the minute textures that create the intricate interior. Here it is being assembled

The architects said: 'The closer one gets to the form, the more features one discovers. Such a hierarchical differentiation can also be found in classic architecture.

While the use of 3D printing in architecture has been limited to producing prototypes as material costs are high and machines limited by size, Mr Hansmeyer and Mr Dillenburger said sandstone-printing technology has emerged as an additive manufacturing technique that overcomes these limitations

'Yet unlike traditional architectural design processes, here a single process is used both to sculpt the overall form, and to create the minute surface details.'

'Today additive manufacturing introduces a paradigm shift within digital fabrication.'

The architects believe 3D printed sandstone (pictured) has unique features that make it suitable to create architectural components as it allows the creation of large elements with lots of detail and accuracy at a competitive price in a short period of time

Natural sandstone has been used as building material since prehistoric times and is a common material used to build cathedrals and ornamental structures as it is a relatively soft material that is easy to carve but has structural resistance - much like the new 3D-printed sandstone.

In order to further harden the micro-detailing of the grotto and to increase the structural stability, the printed sandstone is infiltrated with resin. This resin closes the pores of the artificial sandstone.Â 

Mr Hansmeyer and Mr Dillenburger believe the new technique could be used in the restoration of historic buildings as well as constructing new ones.
