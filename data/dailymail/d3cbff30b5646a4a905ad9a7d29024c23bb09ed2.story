Jailed: Wayne Langley, 29, used a pitchfork to attack the husband of a woman he had an affair with. He was found guilty of affray and jailed for two years

Tending manicured lawns and meticulously kept borders on behalf of customers in a genteel market town, they should have been at one with nature.

But simmering just below the surface for two rival gardening firms was a tangle of deceit and hatred that would explode in the most spectacular fashion.

An affair between one gardener and the wife of his business rival triggered a two-year turf war that erupted into a violent street battle... with the tools of their trade redeployed as weapons.

Elderly residents watched in horror as shovels, pitchforks and a claw hammer were wielded with a vengeance.

Horticulturalist Ben Smith, who had been cuckolded by Wayne Langley, had his teeth knocked out, while his brother Keith Smith was stabbed and hit with a hammer.

A court heard that when police investigated what lay behind the feud, they were told by a relative of Langley: ‘It is all to do with my nephew sh****** that bloke’s wife.’

A jury at Preston Crown Court heard that Ben Smith, 45, had found out about 29-year-old Langley’s affair with his wife and the bad blood between the pair developed into the turf war between the businesses in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire.

The brutal climax came on April 3 when Langley and colleagues were selling garden fertiliser door-to-door and found Mr Smith and his brother spreading compost on a front garden.

Convicted: Langley's cousin Samuel Pollitt, 27, leaving Preston Crown Court where he was also found guilty of affray. He was given a 12 months suspended sentence for two years and 200 hours unpaid work

Sentence: Arthur Pollitt, above, was given a 15 months sentence, suspended for two years and 240 hours unpaid work.

Enraged, Langley leaped out of his 
white van armed with a pitchfork followed by his cousin, Andrew Pollitt,
clutching a claw hammer, with another cousin and an uncle following.

Ben
Smith had teeth knocked out by a blow to the head from a spade which 
left him unconscious on the compost heap. Keith Smith, 53, was speared 
in the arm with a pitchfork and hit on the head with a hammer.

Jon
Close, prosecuting, said: ‘Keith and Ben Smith have come to conflict 
with the defendants in the past. Ben Smith’s wife had had an affair with
Wayne. There was bad blood, resulting in a feud.’

Attack: Ben Smith, 48, and his brother Keith, 53, were laying compost at 10am on April 3 when Langley arrived with his family, enraged that they had beaten him to a customer on the Lancashire street

Wounded: The fight left Ben Smith with fractured eye sockets and missing teeth. His brother Keith was speared in the head

He said a massive fracas erupted with both parties arming themselves with tools from their vans.

He
said: ‘Keith Smith saw Langley approaching Ben with the pitchfork and 
then threw the spade at him.

Despite being unarmed Keith ran towards 
Langley and began to fight with him and at this point he was struck with
the pitchfork. Andrew swung the hammer at Keith’s head striking him.

‘Andrew Pollitt then hit Ben over the head – and the victim remembers nothing else. A number of Ben’s teeth were knocked out.’

Stunned
residents said they saw Mr Smith spitting out his own teeth and being 
stamped upon. Two men were said to have used gardening tools to hold him
down while a third man beat him.

Ben Smith’s injuries included 
fractures to both lower eye sockets. Keith Smith’s included puncture 
wounds to the right arm.

Horrified residents: The people of sleepy Riversway in Lancashire looked on in horror as the attack broke out

Langley and his relatives were arrested on the M6 as they drove back to their homes in Manchester.

Robin
Kitching, for Langley, said: ‘He doesn’t accept that he started the 
violence.’ Langley was jailed for two years. His uncle Arthur Pollitt, 
53, was given 15 months suspended, and 240 hours of unpaid work.

Langley’s
cousin Sam Pollitt, 27, was given 12 months suspended for two years and
200 hours of unpaid work. Andrew Pollitt, 43, will be sentenced later. 
All were charged with wounding but prosecutors accepted their pleas of 
guilty to the lesser charge of affray
