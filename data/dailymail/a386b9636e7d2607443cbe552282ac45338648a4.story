A Florida mayor has come under fire after footage emerged of her calling slow learners 'dummies'.

Video footage shows West Palm Beach mayor Jeri Muoio using the term while responding to questions about grouping slower learning children together in one school.

But she has already responded to criticism of the comment saying her words were taken out of context and that she would 'never disparage children.'

Her use of the term emerged in an advertisement paid for by a committee of former lobbyists in Tallahassee known as Voters Response.

The video shows the mayor saying: 'Your're talking about ability ability-grouping kids and putting all the dummies in one place.'

It continues with the words 'Did Jeri Muoio really say that?' appearing on screen before the advertisement reruns Muoio saying 'dummies' two more times.

On Tuesday, the educator of 30 years responded to the revelation by claiming that she was referring to the wider issue of whether to place slower learning children in one school or have children of all abilities learning together.

According to wesh.com, her full comment was: 'We've, for years, fought against ability-grouping and that's what this would be. 

'You're talking about ability grouping kids and putting all the dummies in one place. And that's not how kids learn. Kids need to be in heterogeneous groups to learn best.'

Hitting back over the ad, wesh.com reports her as saying: 'I'm a mother, I'm a grandmother, I would never disparage children, ever, that's just not who I am.

'I feel like this is a cheap trick by Tallahassee lobbyists.'

Wesh.com reports that when asked whether she regretted using the term 'dummies', she said: 'You have the script there and the context. Of course, if I hadn't said it, it would be better.'

The website says it has yet to hear back from Voters Response following a request for a comment.
