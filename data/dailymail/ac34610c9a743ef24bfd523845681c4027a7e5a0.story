Burglars ransacked the home of a double amputee Afghanistan veteran while he was at a military rehabilitation centre adapting to his prosthetics.

Chris Middleton lost his left leg above the knee and the right below the knee when he was caught in a roadside bombing in Helmand in 2011.

The 23-year-old from Syston, Leicestershire, was at Surrey's Headley Court military rehab centre when the offenders broke into his home.

Sister Gemma Middleton, 20, who shares the house with Chris, came home to find the house ransacked

They stole two 50-inch plasma televisions, a Mac computer and laptop and some clothing.

The intruders also ransacked his home, smashing sentimental pictures in the process.

Chris said: ‘Who would do this?

‘There are photographs of me in uniform and with my prosthetic legs throughout the house.

‘I'm literally trying to get myself back on my feet and then someone comes and does this to me.’

Chris has been attending Headley Court for the last six months to get used to his new prosthetic legs which he says have given him back his independence.

The break-in was discovered by Chris' sister, Gemma, when she came home from a late shift.

The 20-year-old has lived with her brother since he bought the house in February 2013.

Gemma said: ‘There are photographs of Chris in uniform, and with his prosthetic legs, all around the house.

‘If they didn't know whose house they were burgling before they went in, they must have done by the time they left.’

She added: ‘They have left the house in such a mess. Every drawer was pulled open and emptied and our wardrobes pulled apart.

‘I think they were probably looking for money they thought we might have hidden. Chris has put everything into this house.

‘When I told him what had happened he was so angry and upset that someone could do this to his home.

‘I just hope the people who did this to him realise just what they have done.’
