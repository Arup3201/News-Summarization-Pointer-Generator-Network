Kind-hearted strangers offered up their spare bedrooms to a middle-class couple forced to sleep in Heathrow after losing their home.

Well-wishers flooded Katrina Smith, 62, and Alan Lane, 71, with offers after reading of their plight in the Daily Mail this weekend. 

The couple spend five nights a week sleeping in Heathrow Airport after losing their home in Dorset and all of their savings. 

Their only luxury is a room in a £50 airport B&B twice a week when they forego proper meals for beds and access to a washing machine.  

Alan Lane and Katrina Smith have been inundated with offers of accommodation from kind-hearted strangers since sharing their story. The couple have been sleeping at Heathrow Airport after losing their home 18 months ago

Within hours of their story being shared online, the couple received more than £9,000 in donations from kind strangers across the world via a Go Fund Me page set up in their name

Since sharing their heartbreaking story, Good Samaritans across the UK have come forward to lend a hand.

More than £9,000 has been raised through a GoFundMe page set up in their name by a stranger. 

'We're just totally bowled over and gobsmacked. 

'We're trying to get our heads around it. People in this country are just great. It's amazing and totally renews faith in the human spirit,' Mrs Smith told MailOnline.

The couple will stay in the B&B for a few more nights as it was prepaid, but said they could not express enough thanks for the offers of accommodation and donations to help them get back on their feet. 

Julie Nairn, a volunteer who works with the elderly and lonely, has offered the couple free accommodation at a self-contained flat at her New Forest home for a month. 

The 63-year-old and her husband, Christopher, said they felt obliged to help Mr Smith and Ms Lane, because theirs is a fate that 'could happen to anyone'.

'We just simply want to help. There are a lot of people out there like this but you don't often hear of them. 

'It brings it home to you, there are hard working people out there who are given bad advice and they try to do be independent and do the right thing but they lose everything. 

Mrs Smith was moved to tears by the kindness of people offering their homes, while Mr Lane described their generosity as 'amazing'. Among the well-wishers to have offered to take them in is Christopher and Julie Nairn (right) who live in the New Forest 

The couple were living in Poole, Dorset, before becoming overwhelmed by debt. Neither has signed on to benefits, but their monthly income is not enough to allow for rent and loan repayment

'It's appalling that no local councils or government can help them.' 

Mr and Mrs Nairn have offered the couple free accommodation at their home for a month,while Bero Ganger, a single foster carer who lives near Heathrow in Southall, said they could stay in her spare bedroom 'for as long as they need'. 

'I feel so sorry for them, it has struck a chord with me and I really want to help. 

'I have a spare room in my home where I am a foster carer which they can have for as long as they need until they get back on their feet,' the 55-year-old said. 

'Even if they just want to come for a coffee, chat or a shower, they are welcome. Whatever they need.' 

Meanwhile an online donations page has been set up in the hope of raising enough money for the couple to find a new home. 

Natalie Longford, a mother-of-one from Stockton-on-Tees, set up the GoFundMe page (found here) which has raised more than £9,000.

'It could happen to anybody, I just want to help them and this is an easy way to do it,' said Ms Longford. 

The funds will be handed over once released by Go Fund Me, with Miss Longford able to grant Mr Lane and Ms Smith access to the account. 

The couple were forced to move out of their home in Dorset (above). They now spend some nights in the airport and others at a B&B nearby, foregoing meals to afford the room and access to a washing machine

Mr Lane and Ms Smith had to give up their home in Poole, Dorset, 18 months ago, after a string of bad luck and poor financial advice. 

They have been living hand-to-mouth since, spending their nights in different sections of Heathrow Airport. 

While the couple have a limited income, it is not enough to cover their debts and a month's rent, let alone a deposit for a new flat or house. 

Despite being eligible to claim Job Seeker's Allowance, Ms Smith has never signed on. Before finding themselves without a home, Mr Lane worked as a communications consultant. 

But in a matter of years the number of contracts he retained dwindled. Ms Smith desperately applied for supermarket cashier jobs and positions in nurseries, but was consistently passed over for younger applicants.

Now they choose whether to eat or spend the night in a B&B, with weight 'slipping off' Mr Smith, 71. 

While missing simple luxuries (Mrs Smith would most like to be able to make a cup of tea for herself when she wants one), the couple remained upbeat despite their circumstances. 

'As soon as our luck changes, as soon as an opportunity comes our way, we’ll be up and running again with a new life,' Mr Lane said yesterday.

While Heathrow has a group of dedicated social workers offering support to people found sleeping rough in its terminals, no one from the team has approached the couple.
