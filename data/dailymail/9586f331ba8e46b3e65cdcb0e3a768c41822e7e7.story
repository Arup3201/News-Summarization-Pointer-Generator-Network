IT has often been voted the nation’s favourite dish. But it seems our taste for chicken tikka masala may be cooling.

Research shows the orange-tinged curry has been usurped by a lesser-known pretender, the jalfrezi.

A far hotter dish, cooked using green chillis, it is now the most popular dish in Britain’s 10,000 Indian restaurants, the survey found.

Currying favour: The jalfrezi has been confirmed as Britain's new favourite curry

It is thought Britons are becoming 
more adventurous in their tastes, with restaurant diners developing a 
much higher tolerance to hot foods.

Coming in at second place was the madras, another spicy dish containing generous helpings  of chilli.

Chicken tikka masala made it into only eighth place in the poll by Chaat!, the in-house magazine of the British Curry Club.

Among the 1,000 people polled, jalfrezi took 21 per cent of the vote and madras 18 per cent.

Moving down: The traditionally favoured masala could only manage eighth in the poll of more than 1,000 curry-lovers

Just over 10 per cent voted for rogan josh, a medium-spiced dish, while korma, a creamy, milder dish, was chosen by 2 per cent.

The poll found six million Britons a day visit curry houses.

Enam Ali, owner of Le Raj restaurant in Epsom, Surrey, and founder of the British Curry Awards, said Britons are getting more used to spicy dishes.

He said: ‘Once you have a flavour of spice on your palate, it’s very difficult to go back to having something plain.

'The British palate is changing. People’s tolerance for spiciness has gone up, and they are beginning to appreciate it more.

‘London is now the best place for a curry, even better than India. All the top chefs are here now.’

Dave Jenkins, editor-in-chief of Chaat!, said: ‘It’s great to see that people are becoming more adventurous rather than going for the safer dishes such as korma.

‘People are after more exciting dishes and flavours these days. Curry is now so ingrained into our culture, it’s no longer a novelty dish.

'People are becoming more savvy with what’s on offer, and we have so many choices right now. Chicken tikka masala was never going to stay at the top for ever.’

Chicken tikka masala is said to have been invented in a Glasgow curry house when a customer said his chicken was too dry.

Scrabbling about in the kitchen, the chef hit upon the idea of preparing a sauce by putting spices into a tin of Campbell’s condensed tomato soup.

INGREDIENTS

METHOD

Chop the onion, garlic, chillis and peppers, and saute in a glug of olive oil until the onions turn translucent.

Add the ground coriander, cumin and turmeric and stir to coat the vegetables.

Cube
the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces and add to the pan to brown. 
The chicken should take on the colour of the turmeric.

Add the 
tin of tomatoes and chicken stock and cook for 20 minutes, until the 
chickenis cooked and the sauce has reduced and thickened.

Add the salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

Stir in the fresh coriander to wilt before serving.

Garnish with a couple of coriander leaves, and serve with boiled basmati rice and naan bread.
