A former model has told how she dieted down to a dangerously low 115lbs following her agent's orders.

Meredith Hattam, 27, revealed in a personal essay for VICE that when she entered the industry she was issued a strict diet plan to help her lose around two inches off her slender 135lb, 5ft 9in frame.

'I didn’t understand that 800 calories a day 
countered by two hours of exercise was a starvation diet, something 
capable of doing long-term damage to my metabolism,' the brunette recalled.

Frail and miserable: Meredith Hattam from New York said she dieted down to a dangerously low 115lbs following her agent's orders - her she is pictured at her thinnest, aged 19

Bread was off limits and only sources of lean protein including chicken, fish, steamed vegetables, almonds and eggs were allowed.

Over a seven-week period she lost 20lbs - taking her down to a tiny size two - and was promptly sent off to work in New York City.

Although her agency was thrilled with her new gaunt look, Ms Hattam, then aged 19, said she felt 'miserable and frail'.

'I would walk miles around the city for hours on end just to burn off any food I'd ingested'

In
 New York it was a struggle to keep the weight off, but new jobs and 
praise from her reps made Ms Hattam believe it was all worth while.

However, her unhealthy habits soon spiraled out of control.

'I binged at free dinners provided by promoters and punished myself afterwards by not eating for days,' she said.

'I would walk miles around the city for hours on end just to burn off any food I'd ingested.'

In a good place: The California native, who currently works as graphic designer, is now a healthy size four and does not know how much she weighs

Eventually she burned herself out and returned home to San Diego where she checked in for therapy.

Realizing that modeling wasn't doing her 
any good, she chose another career path and completed a degree in media 
studies. Today she works in New York as a freelance graphic designer.

She told MailOnline that she feels in 'a 
good place' now but it took her a longtime to recover and craft a 
self-identity outside of modeling.

'Do not model if you can't model... I wouldn't recommend modeling to teenagers at all'

In a bid to help others in her position, she wants the fashion industry to promote a healthier body image and is a supporter of the Model Alliance, a non-profit which fights for models' rights.

Asked what her message is to other young girls, she replied: 'Do not model if you can't model. If you are tall and thin, don't let a scout or agent persuade you to lose weight or change yourself, or else you may pay the psychological tow.

'Also, do not feel like you need to do anything you don't want to do.

'You are in charge of your life - if you really do want to lose weight and be a model, consult a nutritionist, talk with your family, and do it in a healthy way. I wouldn't recommend modeling to teenagers at all.'

According to a 2012 study conducted by the Model Alliance 68.3per cent of models admit to suffering from depression or anxiety.
