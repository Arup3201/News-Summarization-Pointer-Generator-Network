A dozen former Taliban militants laid down their arms today as they surrendered to an amnesty programme in Afghanistan.

Reports state the 12 fighters renounced their Taliban ties as the handed weapons over to the government during a ceremony in Herat.

For more than a decade Taliban-led militants have been waging a bloody war against Afghan and NATO forces, often infiltrating security forces and carrying out deadly attacks.

Surrender: The amnesty comes as foreign combat troops prepare to withdraw by the end of 2014

But those who renounced all ties today did so to Afghan President Hamid Karzai and NATO leaders who launched the well-funded Taliban amnesty program in the past few months.

The promise to surrender links to the terrorist network is said to be in return for free care of war wounds, temporary housing, a job and an empty plot of land.

The latest U.S. backed bid to persuade militants to hand over their weapons comes after a similar initiative, In 2007, lured several thousand Taliban fighters renouncing the insurgency.

Along the lines of the Sons of Iraq program that persuaded thousands of Sunni Muslims to give up the Iraq insurgency - it is hoped many more continue to come forward.

Heavy weaponry: Some of the weapons handed in as part of the amnesty included hand grenades

Weapons: The amnesty program was relaunched by President Hamid Karzai in the last couple of months

Despite its apparent early success however, the news of the 12 fighters surrendering themselves over to the government came on the same day as a roadside bombing in southern Afghanistan killed a district police chief.

Officials said the attack came as insurgents targeted Afghan security forces amid the drawdown of foreign troops.

Ahmadulah Nazik, who is the administrator of the Dand district in Kandahar province, said Rahmatullah Khan died while trying to reach a police outpost under Taliban attack.

The killing comes a day after four policemen were shot dead in southern Helmand province by their own colleagues.

The US-led Nato coalition is continuing its drawdown towards a planned withdrawal of the majority of combat troops in 2014.

Insider and other attacks have thrown doubt on the capabilities of the Afghans to maintain control after the transition.
