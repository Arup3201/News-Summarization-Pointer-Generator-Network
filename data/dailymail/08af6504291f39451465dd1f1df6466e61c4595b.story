FC Toronto president Tim Leiweke has hit out at Jermain Defoe, claiming he can 'get the hell out of our way' if he does not want to return to the MLS. 

Defoe, who signed for the American club six months ago on a four-year-deal, is currently being paid £90,000 a week and has played 16 matches for his new side.

Despite scoring 11 goals in his time there - an impressive goals-per-game ratio - Defoe is said to be looking for a premature end to his spell in the USA, in favour of a move back to the Premier League.

Jermain Defoe has not settled well into the MLS, and wants a quick return to England

Deadline day moves to QPR and Leicester fell through, but the former could still be an option for Defoe 

Speaking at Ryerston University, Toronto president Leiweke said: 'I personally don't think Defoe will come back. I think if he doesn't want to be here you get rid of him.

'My attitude is, if you want to be here and buy into what we've been doing, let's go...I will be with you every day. If you don't want to be here, get the hell out of our way.' 

Defoe was linked with deadline day moves to Queens Park Rangers and Leicester City, but after both fell through the ex-Tottenham striker is said to be exploring other avenues.  

FC Toronto though, are in pole position when it comes to selling the want-away forward. Defoe still has three-and-a-half-years left on his deal, and his club will want to hold out until January to enable them to recoup some of their £6 million transfer fee. 

Leiweke was quick to compare Defoe to David Beckham, a success story of promoting the MLS around the globe.

'Has Jermain Defoe ultimately adapted as well as David Beckham did?

'David Beckham had more character, more grit, more determination than any player I've ever been around.

Never once did he run, hide or fade away.'  

Defoe has been with Toronto for less than a year but he could be on the move again
