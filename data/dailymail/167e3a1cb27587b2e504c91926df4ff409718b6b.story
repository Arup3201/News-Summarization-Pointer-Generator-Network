When a multi-millionaire couple decided to wind-down their business empire and move to Portugal they thought they were headed for sun, sea and relaxation.

Instead it triggered a 12-year running battle with the tax authorities and now means the couple could face a £600,000 tax bill.

Stephen and Pauline Rumbelow, who owned a grade 1 listed mansion and made a fortune in property development, insisted they had abandoned Britain as their home when they drove their Mercedes to the continent in April 2001.

The couple bought 16th Century pile, Winnington Hall, near Northwich, which Mrs Rumbelow ran as a restaurant and conference centre - working so hard that she eventually suffered a breakdown

But the Salford-born parents-of-three, both aged 57, are now facing up to tax bills totalling almost £600,000 after a tribunal ruled that their hearts had stayed in England and they had continued to view their farmhouse, in Northwich, Cheshire, as their true home.

From lowly beginnings as an engineering apprentice straight from school, Mr Rumbelow - who described himself as a 'hard hat man' - had built up a phenomenally successful building and property development business.

The couple's energetic rise culminated in their purchase of 16th Century mansion, Winnington Hall, near Northwich, which Mrs Rumbelow ran as a restaurant and conference centre - working so hard that she eventually suffered a breakdown.

That was the trigger for the couple's plan to 'tidy up' their business affairs, escape the stress of it all and make a new life for themselves on the continent, Judge Jonathan Cannan told the First-Tier Tax Tribunal.

After briefly living in an unfurnished flat in Belgium - which was 'not to their taste' - the couple built themselves a villa - the 'Villa Rumba' - in Silves, Portugal, intending to 'lead the easy life' and settle down to enjoy the weather.

However, their idyll was disturbed 
when Revenue and Customs refused to accept that they were resident 
abroad in the tax years 2001-2005 and hit them with retrospective tax 
demands.

The Rumbelows, who 
lived at a farm in Crowton before their departure, argued that they had 
intended to make their lives permanently abroad when they boarded the 
Europe-bound train in 2001.

After years of hard work to establish their fortune, they said they wanted to retire and hoped the move would benefit Mrs Rumbelow's health as well as 'improving their quality of life'.

They said they had only since returned to England as visitors to see friends and family - and never for more than the 90 days-a-year, the threshhold then applied by the tax authorities for overseas residence.

However, dismissing the couple's appeal, Judge Cannan noted Mr Rumbelow's 'deep suspicion' of the tax authorities and found that their departure had not marked 'a distinct break' with the UK.

Their youngest daughter was only 15 when they headed abroad but had stayed behind in England.

Although her mother 'would have liked nothing better' than for her to go with them to Portugal, she did not want to leave Northwich and could not be forced to move against her will.

Noting the couple's, particularly Mrs Rumbelow's, close family links to Northwich, the judge said they had never sold the farm and were 'not merely travellers' when they stayed there during their frequent trips back to England.

Although the couple protested that their intention to make their permanent home abroad 'could not have been more distinct or clear', the judge said that the farm had 'remained, essentially, a family home'.

Mr Rumbelow had continued to be closely involved in winding down the couple's businesses and, although there had been some 'loosening' of their social and family bonds with Northwich, it was not 'substantial' enough to make them non-UK residents.
