Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Shay Given dressed as a leprechaun on Tuesday morning to wish his fans a happy St Patrick's Day.

The 38-year-old, who has 127 caps for the Green Army, took to Twitter and posted a snap of himself wearing a Leprechaun hat and ginger beard.

Giving the thumbs up, the Aston Villa stopper said: 'Happy St. Patricks Day everyone, hope you all have a great day.'

The Republic of Ireland keeper retired from international football in August 2012 following the European Championships that summer before making himself available for selection once more five months later.

Given is the second most-capped Republic of Ireland player in history - behind record-holder Robbie Keane who has earned 138 caps - and has kept 55 clean sheets for his country.

Meanwhile, in the Premier League, Given has played No 2 to Brad Guzan at Villa Park during the last few seasons having signed for the Midlands club in 2011 from Manchester City.

However, the former Newcastle City stopper has featured in all four of his side's FA Cup matches this term during Aston Villa's march to Wembley.

Tim Sherwood's side will face Liverpool or Blackburn in the FA Cup semi-finals next month.
