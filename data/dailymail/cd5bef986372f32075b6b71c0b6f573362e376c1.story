Standing in the middle of a pitch with a crowd of around 40,000 questioning your fitness and ability to get decisions right is a real test of mental strength.

Having a group of athletic, testosterone-fuelled players surrounding you, trying to intimidate and bully you into making a decision which favours them, is almost too much to bear.

And I am incredulous that Gary Neville and John Terry seem to think this harassment of referees is now somehow acceptable.

John Terry (centre) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following Ibrahimovic's first-half challenge

In November 2006 I reported Chelsea and their players for attempting to intimidate me during a game at Tottenham.

I asked the FA to study a specific incident, which was clear on video, when I felt intimidated and pressurised to give a decision.

The FA reviewed the footage and said as I did not look frightened or intimidated, they would not be taking the case any further.

This is not a case of Chelsea- bashing, although it was their players again who demonstrated that apparently anything is acceptable now in the pursuit of winning a football match. Ganging up on referees is happening more and more and unless something is done to reverse the trend, it will get worse.

We have former England captain Terry saying that hounding a referee is OK because everyone does it.

On Wednesday night I am sure that Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers was influenced after being harassed by Chelsea’s outfield players. There was nothing in his body language to suggest he was about to reach for his red card and send off Paris Saint-Germain’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic until all that pressure was brought to bear.

Some observers will suggest that referees could just brandish cards at players who apply too much pressure.

However, players know that there is no credibility in showing multiple yellow cards at such incidents.

Instead, the time has come to rule that only the captains should be allowed to approach the referee.
