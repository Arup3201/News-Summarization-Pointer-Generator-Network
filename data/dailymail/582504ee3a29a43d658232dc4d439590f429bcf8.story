Martin Clarkson: The 59-year-old attacked his estranged wife with a pocket knife

A man who stabbed his estranged wife in the head because she was given custody of their dogs following their split has walked free from court.

After attacking Sarah Dowse in the street with a pocket knife as she walked the terriers near her home in Redcar, Martin Clarkson, 59, was heard to say: 'I've given her face a good kicking... she'll need plastic surgery.'

Police initially treated the incident as attempted murder, but Clarkson was given a 15-month suspended sentence after admitting inflicting grievous bodily harm.

Ms Dowse, 34, last night told of her shock that her former husband was not jailed for the incident on January 24, which saw Clarkson repeatedly stab his ex in the head and fracture her cheekbone before he was overpowered by a passerby.

Teesside Crown Court heard he fled to the home of another former wife following the attack and asked: 'Have the police been?', before describing how he had given Ms Dowse's face 'a good kicking'.

Passing sentence, Judge Peter Moorhouse imposed a five-year restraining order preventing Clarkson from contacting his ex, but Ms Dowse has since said the ban 'won't stop me feeling in fear of him every day'.

'I expected him to get a prison sentence, and I feel what he received was inadequate for the suffering he caused me,' she said.

Prosecutor Tamara Pawson told Teesside Crown Court the couple had been together for eight years and married for two.

The relationship broke down late last year and by the time of the incident, Clarkson was said by his barrister to have been at 'an all-time low'.

Ms Dowse was walking the Patterdale terrier and border terrier when Clarkson shouted from across the road: 'Can I talk to you?' She replied 'no'.

'Inadequate': Judge Peter Moorhouse gave Clarkson a 15-month suspended sentence

He then ran at his former wife with an open pocket knife in his hand, threatening to stab her, Ms Pawson told the court.

Clarkson sliced through one dog lead and then began 'sawing' at the neck of Ms Dowse’s jacket and repeatedly stabbing her head, the court heard.

Peter Makepeace, mitigating, told the court the estranged couple's disagreement over their dogs had caused his client to 'snap'.

'Huge difficulties arose about the dogs, who would have custody of them,' he said.

'That is what made Mr Clarkson snap this day. He has never been in trouble before in 60 years and it is explicable by extremely heightened emotions involved in relationship breakdowns.

'He is deeply ashamed of what he has done... he understands it is in everyone’s interests he is kept apart from Sarah Dowse.'

Imposing a restraining order and supervision to include alcohol treatment, Judge George Moorhouse told Clarkson: 'It is a very sad day when someone of your age with no previous convictions comes before the court for the first time.'Ms Dowse said last night: “No-one deserves to suffer domestic violence and I would urge anyone who is to get help, there is help out there.

'When I was told what he had received by my barrister, I was devastated. He was given a restraining order but that won’t stop me feeling in fear of him every day.'

Peter Cuthbertson from the Centre for Crime Prevention said: 'This is an appalling example of the overuse of suspended sentences when prison would be more appropriate.'

The Centre for Crime Prevention is calling on the government to limit suspended sentences to instances involving minor, first-time offenders.

'They should not be used for hardened criminals and crazed stabbings,' Mr Cuthbertson said.
