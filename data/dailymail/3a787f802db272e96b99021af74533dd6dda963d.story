The head of Ukraine’s secret service has claimed rebels intended to down a Russian airliner to give Vladimir Putin a pretext for invasion – but blasted Flight MH17 out of the sky by mistake.

Valentyn Nalyvaichenko said that Russian-backed fighters were supposed to take their BUK rocket launcher – which had been transported across the Russian border – to a village called Pervomaiskoe in Ukrainian-held territory west of Donetsk.

Instead, they mistakenly positioned it in a rebel-controlled village of the same name to the east of the city.

Got it wrong? Valentyn Nalyvaichenko claims pro-Russian rebels targeted the wrong civilian airliner

If they had gone where they had been ordered, he said, they would have hit an Aeroflot flight carrying civilians travelling from Moscow to Larnaca in Cyprus.

Crucially, the crash site would have been in Ukrainian-held territory.

The mass killing of Russian tourists could then have been blamed on the Ukrainian army, giving Moscow a justification for invasion, said Mr Nalyvaichenko, head of the Ukrainian intelligence service, the SBU. 

‘This cynical terrorist act was intended to justify an immediate military invasion by the Russian Federation,’ he said.

Aeroflot flight AFL2074 was close to Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 when it was blown out of the sky on July 17, killing all 298 on board, he said.

‘It is incredibly cynical that the act of terrorism was planned against peaceful innocent Russian citizens who were on the way to their holidays with children,’ added Mr Nalyvaichenko.

He claimed this was a significant conclusion of Kiev’s probe into MH17’s downing.

Last night there was no independent confirmation of the claim by the SBU, formerly part of the Soviet KGB but now closely co-operating with Western intelligence agencies.

There are no fewer than seven villages called Pervomaiskoe in Donetsk region, and the rebels chose the wrong one – close to Torez – to site the mobile BUK system, according to the theory.

The SBU say that they have given evidence of their ‘wrong village’ allegations to the Dutch-led team leading the investigation into the crash. 

Tensions: The offensive in Ukraine continued last night amid claims Russia was preparing a military invasion

'Immense convoy': Kiev-sent troops paraded down a road near Donetsk allegedly heading off Russian troops

The news came as tensions in Ukraine rose yesterday after claims Russia was preparing to stage a military invasion in the guise of a ‘humanitarian’ mission, which Russia has been repeatedly calling for in the east of the country.

An ‘immense convoy’ comprising ‘troops and military hardware’ was thwarted from entering the country early yesterday, according to a senior Ukrainian official, amid fears of a full-scale war breaking out.

Britain and the US warned sending Russian troops in a ‘humanitarian’ mission would be ‘unjustified and illegal’.

A rebel leader in Donetsk has claimed the city is surrounded by Ukrainian forces and that his troops are willing to accept a ceasefire. 

But observers warned that it may be a tactical move laying the groundwork for Russian intervention.

The SBU separately claimed that President Putin had sent his crack Pskov Airborne Assault Division to the village of Veidelevka in Russia’s Voronezh region, six miles from the border.

Other brigades from Siberia have been posted close to the frontier, to join tens of thousands of troops already in the area.

‘The personnel of these compounds are preparing firing positions and equipping field camps,’ said Andriy Lysenko of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council.
