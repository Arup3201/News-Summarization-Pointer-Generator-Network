A South African student who survived the horrific triple axe murder of his own family may have been high on drugs at the time of the attack, police believe.

And a 'runner' who claims he delivered dope and crystal meth to Henri van Breda, 20, has been tracked down by South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper.

Henri was left with minor injuries following the horrific slaying of his parents and older brother last month at their upmarket security estate in the winelands outside Cape Town.

Henri van Breda, 20, was left with minor injuries following the horrific slaying of his parents and older brother in Cape Town last month

His 16 year-old sister Marli was left fighting for her life, with severe head and neck sounds, and remains under police guard in hospital, too traumatised and injured to answer questions.

The Sunday Times tracked down a youth who claimed to have been Henri's drug 'runner'. Calling himself 'Mark', he identified physics student Henri from a photograph and said he was a regular customer.

The 'runner' lives in a shack at the edge of a small shanty town, less than a quarter of a mile from the luxury De Zalze golf estate where the van Bredas lived.

He claimed Henri bought marijuana and crystal meth. Known by its local name of 'tik', the drug is cheap, easy to buy, highly addictive and known to fuel agression. Rife in the Cape Flats – a poor, gang-ridden area of Cape Town – 'tik' has become increasingly popular with young wealthy whites.

'He started coming here a couple of months ago, sometimes by himself, and sometimes with a friend. They drove a motorbike,' Mark told the newspaper.

'He would give me between R40 and R200 (2.50 and 12.50 pounds) at a time. Then I would go and get his drugs from the dealer. He bought tik, and from another dealer in Jamestown he bought dagga (marijuana).'

The attackers left Marli (pictured) with a cut throat and 'severe' head injuries on the balcony of her home in Stellenbosch - 50 kilometres east of Cape Town

Henri alerted emergency services four hours after the blood bath on the first floor of his family home, and at one point was heard to giggle during the seven minute call.

Police doctors believe the blond student's cuts and bruises may have been self-inflicted, although he claims he was knocked unconscious when the killer threw the axe at him.

Police are investigating several possible motives for the brutal attack at the luxury home on a heavily-guarded golf estate where access is strictly controlled by guards, cameras and electric fences.

Detectives are investigating reports that Henri's parents had cut off his allowance in the days before the savage murder, which killed Martin, 54, his wife Teresa, 55, and their oldest child 22 year-old Rudi.

Investigators may apply to have Henri's medical records released. It is understood he spent time at an exclusive drug rehabilitation centre last time. Police also took blood samples from him shortly after they were called to the murder scene.

The student, whose family returned to South Africa last year after spending a number of years living in Australia, told an emergency operator how they had all been 'attacked by a guy with an axe'.

He claimed he was in the bathroom when the killer went on the rampage and was the last to be targeted when the murder weapon was thrown at him, knocking him out for some time.

When he came to, he dialled for help. At one point during the call, he is heard to giggle.

He is being cared for by relatives, who have vowed to stand by him. They have secured the services of Pieter Botha, a high-profile barrister, who helped secure the acquittal of honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani in December.

'The family is supporting Henri. He is receiving counselling and is being monitored,' said Ben Rootman, a spokesman for the family who refused to comment on the newspaper's reports.

Meanwhile, schoolgirl Marli is being guarded by police around the clock at a private clinic, where she is said to be able to blink in response to questions, but her severe injuries still prevent her from speaking.

Although he has not formally been interviewed by police, Henri has reportedly described how his father Martin rushed to defend his Rudi, but was cut down as by the killer. Mother, Teresa, was the next to be murdered, while Marli somehow survived her appalling injuries.

Henri was not seen at the memorial service held in Pretoria for his family in the days after the January attack but relatives insist he had been present, but was kept hidden from reporters.
