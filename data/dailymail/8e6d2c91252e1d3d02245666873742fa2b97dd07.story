Choosing an outfit before boarding a plan is every woman's pre-holiday predicament.

How do you dress appropriately to battle the UK's freezing conditions en route and air-conditioning on board but also handle the heat when you step off the plane at your final destination?

Now, for the first time, the ultimate travel outfit has been created which allows women to combat this tricky fashion dilemma.

Ultimate travel outfit: TravelSupermarket have unveiled this outfit which allows women to unzip bits of a warm hooded jacket and transform it into a strapless dress or mini-skirt

The Winter Sun Travel Outfit allows women to unzip parts of a warm hooded jacket and remove them, transforming the cosy garment into a strapless dress or mini-skirt ready for arrival in sunnier climes.

The quirky new outfit is the ideal item of clothing for holidaymakers and is even equipped with a inflatable pillow for sleeping on the plane.

By zipping various elements on or off, it can be worn as a winter outfit or one of two summer styles.

The changeable options for the item include the jacket with a hood and mittens, a strapless dress and a mini-skirt.

Snuggle up: Perfect for long haul flights to sunnier climes, the outfit even comes with a pillow

Unzip: By zipping various elements on or off, it can be worn as a winter outfit or one of two summer styles - a strapless dress with handy bag, or a reversible orange or black mini skirt with jersey bolero

Meanwhile, wearers can fashion the jacket sleeves into a useful shoulder bag if they opt for the above-the-knee dress design.

Holiday comparison site TravelSupermarket made the outfit after a study found 57 per cent of holidaymakers have stepped off a plane in unsuitable clothing.

What's more, one in four travellers say changes in climate when they are travelling is a hassle.

A third of respondents said they normally wear layers and strip off when they get to their destination.

But, the all-purpose outfit removes the trouble of having to switch clothes in the plane toilet, as 10 per cent of us have resorted to in the past.

Safe and stylish: The child's green, all-in-one outfit has easy access allowing for smooth nappy changes and a GPS tracker for parents to ensure their little ones are safe

The Winter Sun Travel Outfit has been made with comfort in mind and is designed to accommodate long flights.

And as two thirds of us consider comfort to be the most important element when travelling, it includes an inflatable pillow attached to the collar.

Comfort: Over three quarters of mothers say it is imperative their children are comfortable when travelling

TravelSupermarket have accommodated for children too having created a similar design to be used by youngsters.

The child's green, all-in-one outfit has easy access allowing for smooth nappy changes and a GPS tracker for parents to ensure their little ones are safe.

Over three quarters (76 per cent) of mothers say it is imperative their children are comfortable when travelling.

Both the outfits, the adult and the child version, are made from materials that are both heat retentive and breathable.

Bob Atkinson, a spokesman for TravelSupermarket, said: 'For holidaymakers, deciding what to wear when travelling is a constant dilemma.

'Dressing appropriately for the UK weather as well as for the climate at the destination can prove a struggle.

'For mums it proves even more problematic because they also need to plan and for their children.

'We've created a comfortable, stylish outfit to make travelling easier so holidaymakers don't have to worry about what to travel in.

'If there is enough interest in our prototype we will definitely consider putting a limited edition run into production.'
