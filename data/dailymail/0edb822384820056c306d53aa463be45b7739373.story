Team news 

Everton 

Everton remain with the same quartet of players unavailable ahead of Saturday's  clash with Swansea at Goodison Park.

Kevin Mirallas and John Stones have been sidelined by hamstring and ankle problems respectively, while Bryan Oviedo and Arouna Kone are set to play in a practice game next week as they continue to work their way towards first-team action.

Toffees boss Roberto Martinez has said the knocks Romelu Lukaku sustained in the 3-1 win at Burnley and Darron Gibson picked up in training should not prevent them from being selected.

Provisional squad: Howard, Robles, Coleman, Baines, Hibbert, Browning, Jagielka, Distin, Alcaraz, Gibson, McCarthy, Barry, Besic, Barkley, Osman, Pienaar, Atsu, McGeady, Lukaku, Eto'o, Naismith.

Swansea 

Gylfi Sigurdsson should shrug off a groin injury to feature for Swansea in for their visit to Everton on Saturday.

The influential Iceland international limped off during the second half of last weekend's 2-0 home victory against Leicester and was rested for the Capital One Cup defeat at Liverpool in midweek while Swansea also expect midfielder Ki Sung-yueng to play after a shoulder problem.

Goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, winger Wayne Routledge and striker Wilfried Bony will return after being stood down at Anfield while Argentina defender Federico Fernandez is free to play after having his red card for a tackle on Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho rescinded by the Football Association on Thursday.

Provisional squad: Fabianski, Rangel, Fernandez, Williams, Taylor, Ki, Shelvey, Dyer, Routledge, Sigurdsson, Bony, Tremmel, Bartley, Montero, Carroll, Emnes, Gomis, Fulton, Shephard.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Romelu Lukaku has scored in three of his five Premier League appearances against Swansea.

Swansea beat Everton 3-0 earlier this season in the League Cup which was their first win against the Toffees in any competition after 15 defeats and five draws.

Everton have never lost to Swansea City in the league (18 games). This is the most league games between two teams without any defeat ever by one team against another in the top four tiers of English league football.

Ross Barkley scored the winning goal in each of last season’s two league games between Everton and Swansea City.

Swansea recorded their first ever victory over Everton this season when they won 3-0 in the Capital One Cup. Here, Toffees' James McCarthy battles with Ki Sung-yueng at Liberty Stadium as Bafetimbi Gomis looks on

Wilfried Bony has now scored 20 Premier League goals for Swansea City – the joint most for the Swans in the competition alongside Michu.

The Toffees have won 199 home games in Premier League history.

Swansea City have used just 18 players this season, fewer than any other team in the Premier League.

Roberto Martinez’s men are so far the most accurate shooters in the top flight this season, hitting the target with 54 per cent of efforts.

The Toffees have scored a joint league-high four goals from outside the area (alongside West Ham).

Conversely, Swansea are one of four sides yet to concede a goal from outside the box in the Premier League this season.

The Swans have seen four of their efforts cleared off the line; more than any other in the Premier League this season.
