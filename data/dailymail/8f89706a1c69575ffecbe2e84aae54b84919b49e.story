David Villa insists that he is fit enough to feature for Melbourne City against Sydney FC on Saturday, despite only training with his new side for the first time on Monday.

The former Spain international has not played any competitive football since his country's exit at the World Cup in the summer, but the 32-year-old believes he is in good condition to play for the A-League outfit ahead of their debut in the competition.

The on loan striker has been training with a group of players at MLS parent club New York City for the past month and appears set in featuring at the Allianz Stadium on Saturday night.

David Villa insists he'll be fit to feature for Melbourne City's A-League debut against Sydney FC

Villa only started training with his new team-mates on Monday following an extended break from football

'I feel good, I feel prepared,' the former Valencia, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid star told Goal.com.

'I've been working hard. I obviously had a break [after the World Cup], my last game was the Spain-Australia game but then I took the usual summer break that every player takes.

'But I've been working hard and I've been training to be ready and I hope to be ready for the game.'
