Bought by a family in Kosovo when she was just three weeks old and kept illegally in an apartment, Ema the bear cub's future looked bleak. And lonely.

But this is actually the tale of three little bears, with a happy ending.

Three weeks later, not only did local police rescue Ema from the flat in Peja, she has also been introduced to two other cubs - of the same age, and discovered in the same town - who are probably her brothers.

Three bear cubs rescued from two family homes in Kosovo may actually be related

The female cub, Ema (above), was bought by a family in the city of Peja when she was just three weeks old and kept illegally in their apartment

Ema, who weighs less than 7lb, is currently being nursed back to health by workers from Four Paws charity

The authorities first became aware of the case after the family posted details on Facebook outlining how they acquired and kept the young bear.

Last Wednesday, police and the Environment Ministry staff confiscated the female brown bear cub.

And yesterday, the other two cubs - which have been named Ron and Oska - were found at another family's home in the same city, in the west of Kosovo.

A health check will now be carried out to determine whether the three are siblings.

The trio are currently being looked after by the international animal welfare organisation Four Paws at its bear sanctuary in Prishtina.

Two other cubs, named Osca and Ron, were also rescued from Kosovo and are the same age as Ema

Charity workers think the trio could be related but will have to carry out further medical checks to be certain

The bears, who are weak and underweight, are being nursed back to health using cat milk and honey

'The Environment Ministry and police acted in exactly the right way, by seizing the cubs immediately and informing us', said Four Paws project leader Carsten Hertwig.

'We’re calling for the animal dealers who sold little Ema to be found and brought to justice.

'There should also be legal action against the family which bought and kept the bear illegally.'

Since autumn 2010, the private keeping of brown bears has been banned in Kosovo.

In 2013, Four Paws established the sanctuary in Prishtina for Kosovo’s 15 illegally held restaurant bears.

In the wild, brown bears usually spend two years with their parents, and removing them early is harmful

Privately owning and keeping brown bears has been illegal in Kosovo since autumn 2010

Four Paws has set up a sanctuary for Kosovo's 15 'restaurant bears', so called because they were previously kept in cages and used to entertain people outside restaurants and supermarkets

With the help of the Kosovo Environment Ministry, the police and peace-keeping force KFOR, the organisation was able to rescue 13 bears and transfer them to safety.

However, two bears were killed by their owner just before their planned rescue, and thrown onto a scrap heap.

Hertwig is appalled that another case of illegal bear keeping has now come to light.

Being snatched from their mother while still young could seriously damage a cub's health.

In the wild, young bears spend at least two years with their mother.

Owners have previously taken drastic measures to avoid being caught, including one who killed two 15-month-old bears in 2013 before dumping their bodies on a scrap heap

Four Paws charity are calling for legal action against the family who kept Ema, and the dealers who sold her

'The cubs have had some cat milk and a bit of honey,' said Hertwig.

'But they seem very stressed, fearful and extremely weak – Ema doesn’t even weigh 3kg.

'We hope the rescue was in time, and that with our expert care the cubs can pull through and recover.'
