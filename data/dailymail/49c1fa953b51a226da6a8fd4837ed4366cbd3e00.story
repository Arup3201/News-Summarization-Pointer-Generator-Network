Guilty: Damian Brenninkmeyer admitted slapping his wife in the face in front of their two daughters as they drove on a West London street

An art expert slapped his wife across the face while driving in busy west London as their two children watched from the rear seat - just two days after police cautioned him for another assault on his spouse.

Damian Brenninkmeyer, 42, former head of the Old Masters department at Christies, pleaded guilty at Hammersmith Magistrate's Court to assaulting his wife of 10 years, Fiona, on July 7.

Now banned from his family's Fulham postcode, he is living with his father in Kingston-upon-Thames. He was bailed until August 29 for a pre-sentence report.

Nevertheless, his lawyer Mark Haslam told the court: 'This is a 
marriage both parties think can be saved and there is an email from his 
wife to that effect.'

On that Sunday afternoon, Mr Brenninkmeyer had been driving with his wife, an artist, and their two daughters to her mother's home Buckinghamshire, said prosecutor Paul Mitchell.

'Mrs Brenninkmeyer could sense a bad mood and was afraid the defendant would get angry with her, but he assured her everything was going to be okay,' he said.

'They were driving along Fulham Palace Road when the defendant became aggressive and started shouting: 'I want to punish you for what you did to me'.'

The court heard Brenninkmeyer was still angry with his wife for calling the police two days earlier and told her: 'I'm going to break your phone and tell the accountant not to allow you to have another.'

'She said, "Please calm down for the kids". But he started to bash his fists on the steering wheel while they were still moving,' continued Mr Mitchell.

'He then back-hand hit her across the right side of her face.

'He was driving erratically so she decided to call the police and grabbed her phone, but Mr Brenninkmeyer grabbed her hand, clawing at her hand.

'He gave up, but grabbed her sunglasses from her lap and threw them out of the window.

'The right side of her face was throbbing and she could see bruising as the journey continued and at Beaconsfield Services she took the two girls into a service area and cried.

'Mr. Brenninkmeyer said: 'Why don't you get back in the car? You're causing a scene'.'

There was another row back at the family home that night when Brenninkmeyer discovered his wife had taken money from their joint account to pay a cleaner and he pushed her down onto a sofa.

'Things must never come to fisticuffs': Brenninkmeyer was rebuked by a judge at Hamersmith Magistrates Court

After hearing Brenninkmeyer's guilty plea, District Judge Susan Williams said: 'Slugging his wife across the face while while driving on a busy road with two children in the back is one of the most dangerous things you can do.

'Things must never come to fisticuffs.'

The defendant was assured the bail conditions would not prohibit him seeing his daughters.

'The children will have to see their father and I am sure the fact that he is not at home is distressing to them,' said Mrs Williams.

'This is a marriage we want to see back on the right tracks and this has to be a warning to him that something needs to be done.'

The court heard Brenninkmeyer, who worked at Christie's until 2010 and has also previously worked for London auctioneers Bonhams & Butterfields, has been undergoing treatment for anxiety.

MailOnline contacted Mr Brenninkmeyer for comment, but there was no answer on his phone.
