Twitter has come under fire for its decision to collect data on what other apps users of its mobile service use.

The service began telling users of the change today.

It says it is only collecting data on what apps are installed, and no data from within apps.

Twitter said it has started tracking what other apps people have installed 'to help build a more personal Twitter experience'.

Using Twitter for Android:

Tap the overflow icon

Tap Settings.

Tap the account you'd like to adjust.

Under Other, you can adjust the setting to Tailor Twitter based on my apps.

Using Twitter for iOS:

From the Me tab, tap the gear icon

Tap Settings.

Tap the account you'd like to adjust.

Under Privacy, you can adjust the setting to Tailor Twitter based on my apps.

'To help build a more personal Twitter experience for you, we are collecting and occasionally updating the list of apps installed on your mobile device so we can deliver tailored content that you might be interested in,' it said in a blog post.

'We are only collecting the list of applications you have installed. 

'We are not collecting any data within the applications.'

However, users of the service say it could create privacy issues.

'I have to say that apps can see what other apps you have installed seems like a bit of a security and privacy issue,' said San Francisco Twitter user Tom Coates, after seeing the message alerting him to the new feature. 

'I can obviously see use cases for an app being able to see what other apps are on a Phone - but ... without giving permission?' 

'I Just don't like the idea that any app can spot if I'm tracking a medical condition with a dedicated app or in the US which healthcare I use,' he told MailOnline.

Another user tweeted 'Apparently I don't have privacy' on seeing the message, while dozens of others questioned the move.

Twitter said it will warn users if they are being tracked. 

'We will notify you about this feature being turned on for your account by showing a prompt letting you know that to help tailor your experience, Twitter uses the apps on your device. 

'Until you see this prompt, this setting is turned off and we are not collecting a list of your apps.

Twitter said it will warn users if they are being tracked, and issued instructions for turning the service off.

Twitter isn't the only social network collecting information about apps installed on users' devices.

Facebook collects similar data, although only from apps that have its code written into them.

A Facebook spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal it also collects that data to help it tailor and target its ads. 

For example, the company might use it to help an app developer target ads to users that have already downloaded that developer's other apps.
