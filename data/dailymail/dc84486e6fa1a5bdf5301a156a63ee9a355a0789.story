Britain's Ebola screening plans remained in chaos yesterday as airports said they had been given no instructions.

After days of Government indecision over whether to screen airline passengers to halt the spread of the deadly virus, Downing Street was yesterday still unable to say when the process would start or where it would find the medics to oversee it.

With the incubation period for the disease as long as 21 days, it was feared the delay in introducing measures could mean the deadly virus is already in the UK.

While the US said it would begin screening with temperature checks today, a Downing Street spokesman would only say that Britain’s programme – consisting mainly of questionnaires – would start ‘as soon as possible in the coming days’.

Last night airports, airlines and Eurostar all said they were still waiting for instructions. Gatwick said it knew nothing about the new measures, with an airport spokesman adding: ‘We’ve not had anything at all. We’re still waiting for Public Health England.’

Public Health England, the Government body which had previously said screening would not be effective, is now in charge of the programme but said it had no more details of how it would work.

Labour MP Keith Vaz said the lack of precise information was ‘shambolic’ and critics called the proposed questionnaires ‘a complete waste of time’.

David Cameron said the Government was ‘taking all the steps we can’ to keep Britain safe from Ebola but experts said the continued spread of the disease meant it was likely to arrive in this country soon.

The UN warned the number of cases is doubling every four weeks, with more than 4,000 people now dead in the worst ever outbreak of the virus.

Downing Street said screening will be introduced at Heathrow, Gatwick and the St Pancras Eurostar terminal for passengers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in West Africa – the three nations at the centre of the outbreak.

Taking aim: A thermal scanner is used to test the temperature of a passenger at a Moroccan airport yesterday, but British officials will only ask people if they feel unwell in the first instance

They will be given a questionnaire about their potential exposure to Ebola and their health. Those assessed to pose a risk will have their temperature checked to test for a fever.

Any with a high temperature will be isolated while they undergo further tests.

But critics said a sufferer could show no symptoms on arrival in Britain but still fall ill days later.

Others said travellers would lie on questionnaires to avoid delays.

David Mabey, professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the proposed screening was ‘a complete waste of time’.

He said: ‘Why would anyone admit they have been in contact with someone when they’re in a hurry to get through immigration control?’

Asked if he believed Ebola would reach Britain, he said: ‘I think it’s bound to happen.’

Passengers arriving at Heathrow from Nigeria said their temperatures were taken in Abuja before they boarded, but there were no checks on arrival in Britain – or any warnings about symptoms or where to seek help if they fell ill.

Ministers were accused of a chaotic response to the Ebola crisis last night after it emerged new screening measures at UK airports amounted to little more than a questionnaire
