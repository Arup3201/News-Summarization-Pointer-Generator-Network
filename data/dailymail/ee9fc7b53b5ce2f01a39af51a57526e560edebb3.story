As the sounds of a George Michael song drifted over the tropical  gardens, Thailand’s Crown Prince and his fun-loving wife were in the mood to party.

But the guest of honour at the event was not a visiting head of state or local dignitary – but the couple’s pampered poodle, Foo Foo.

A video of the decadent event shot at the Thai Royal Palace in Bangkok shows Princess Srirasmi – a former waitress – cavorting in just a tiny G-string as she feeds the dog cake.

Controversial: Princess Srirasmi cavorted in just a tiny G-string

In one scene, the topless princess appears to bend over to eat out of a dog bowl, while in another a servant falls to his knees in front of her. Later the royal couple sing Happy Birthday to their dog.

The video emerged as Thailand is rocked by a military coup. Former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra was detained in Bangkok on Friday, and hundreds of people have taken to the streets to protest about the military’s power-grab.

The Crown Prince and his wife yesterday left Tylney Hall, a five-star hotel in Hampshire, where they and a 30-strong entourage had been ensconced for almost a week.

The video is sure to intensify concerns about Prince Maha’s fitness to succeed his father, 86-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The king, who is said to have Parkinson’s disease, has not been seen in public since the military junta decreed martial law.

Last year leaked US diplomatic cables revealed many senior Thai officials expressed grave doubts about the Crown Prince.

In one, a former US ambassador in Bangkok told how Princess Srirasmi confided in him during a state dinner that Foo Foo ‘holds the rank of Air Chief Marshal’.

Four sons of the Crown Prince from a former marriage have been exiled from Thailand by their father since 1996 and now live in the United States.

Yesterday one of them, Juthavachara Vivacharawongse, 34, told The Mail on Sunday at his home near San Diego, California: ‘I would prefer not to speak about this [the coup] or our father. It is a private, family matter.’

The Crown Prince married Princess Srirasmi in 2001. They have a nine-year-old son.

A source in Thailand, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said yesterday: ‘There are many here who would prefer the Crown Prince not to come back.’
