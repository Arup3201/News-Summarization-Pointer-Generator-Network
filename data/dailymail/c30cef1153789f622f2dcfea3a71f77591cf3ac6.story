A graveyard is recognisable only as a graveyard by the sea of uniform headstones standing to attention.

So one developer with a vast plot of land he'd earmarked for a cemetery took a business decision that at best could be described as hasty at worst downright macabre.

He installed row upon row of marble headstones and on them engraved the names of people- still living - in the village nearby.

Macabre advertising: A Chinese entrepreneur has filled a cemetery with gravestones with the names of still-living residents of a nearby village in the hope of drawing in new business

One foot in the grave? Locals call the cemetery the 'Land of the Undead' after the developer took local residents' names without their consent

One local said: 'The more affluent Chinese people become in this life, the more they are concerned with their final resting place on their journey into the next one.

'Running a graveyard in China is now a serious moneymaker.

'What this guy did was seize the opportunity to showcase his plots with all these fake graves.'

A grave slot in the Land of the Undead costs as much as £10,000 and there is no shortage of takers.

Resting place: Two men sit and talk next to the fake graves - it is unclear whether they are sat next to the headstones that bear their names

More to come: Workmen prepare the ground for the installation of more fake graves at the site

But the local authorities are perplexed at the advertising methods employed by the owner.

One official said: 'It is hardly fair to steal peoples’ names and then put them on to gravestones.

'We think he has acted illegally but we are still checking the small print of local statutes.

'It could well be that he is charged with fraud.'
