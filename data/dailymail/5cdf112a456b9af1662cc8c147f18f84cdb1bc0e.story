Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United revolution has even extended to the children’s creche at Old Trafford. 

The play area where United’s stars used to leave their kids on match days while they socialised with their wives and girlfriends in the players’ lounge next door has been converted into a medical room on the instruction of United’s new manager.

Previously, the creche was situated between the medical room and the lounge, but it has been knocked through to double the size of the treatment room.

The old players’ lounge, which was also next to the home dressing-room at Old Trafford, has been split in two – one half is now a pre-match warm-up area and the other is an interview room for overseas media rights holders - while a new combined players’ lounge and children’s area has been relocated elsewhere in the stadium.

A club source told The Sun: ‘Scrapping the historic players’ room and creche has created a bit of a stir. But Van Gaal was adamant with what he wanted and everyone has had to fall in line.

‘The players’ lounge is now a warm-up area and team members are invited into a different part of the stadium to spend time with their families.

‘The creche is gone and has not been moved elsewhere.’

It is the latest change implemented by Van Gaal since he took over in the summer after the Dutchman ordered a £3million overhaul of United’s Carrington training base.

Two training pitches have been ripped up and replaced with the identical Desso surface that is used at Old Trafford, a £500,000 video surveillance system has been installed so Van Gaal can analyse his squad more closely in training, and sleeping pods are available for players to rest in between double training sessions rather than having to go home.

The manager has also introduced a strict 1pm mealtime with rectangular canteen tables replaced by circular ones and all the players ordered to speak in English.
