What party poopers. Wrexham were all set to celebrate their 150th birthday and had their eye on a rather nice present - the FA Trophy.

Coasting at 2-0 with just a quarter-hour remaining here at Wembley, Wrexham had their celebrations well underway. Then, North Ferriby United decided to roll up, gatecrash and ruin everything.

Goals from Louis Moult and Jay Harris had the Welsh side in complete control but North Ferriby, who play a division below, forced extra time through Liam King’s penalty and Ryan Kendall’s late leveller.

Then, incredibly, they took the lead as Kendall pounced again, only for Moult to send this magnificent advertisement for the non-league game to penalties.

The first five spot-kicks were all scored, the next four saved and the four after that all scored. And so it was Wrexham’s Steve Tomassen, under the pressure of sudden death, who had to be the fall-guy.

His penalty was kept out by Adam Nicklin and so North Ferriby were the ones who ascended the 107 steps to lift the handsome silver trophy.

It was, it’s fair to say, the finest moment in their 81-year existence, a moment nobody associated with the Humberside club will ever forget.

For Wrexham, the national stadium has become something of a second home. This was their third visit in as many years - in 2013, they beat Grimsby Town in the FA Trophy final before returning later in the same campaign for the Conference Play-offs final, losing to Newport County.

North Ferriby is a village on the north bank of the Humber, not too far from Hull. It has a population of under 4,000 and most of them seemed to have decamped to Wembley for the day. The place itself must have been eerily empty.

Among those watching on was Hull City chairman Assem Allam, while Tigers manager Steve Bruce had fixed it with his pal Sam Allardyce for Ferriby to use West Ham’s training facilities on the eve of the game.

The Villagers, ninth in their league, had played under the Twin Towers but not under the Arch. It was 1997 when they last came to Wembley, losing to Whitby Town in the FA Vase final.

The Welsh side were backed by some 10,000 supporters and, as expected, they made the early running. It took just 11 minutes to make the breakthrough as Moult continued his marvellous run of goals in this season’s Trophy.

He scored at Stockport County in the second round, two more in the replay, and in both legs of the semi-final with Torquay United. In all, he has 16 goals this season and this was the most significant.

Joe Clarke advanced down the left and exchanged passed with Connor Jennings before crossing low for Moult to finish from about eight yards. It was an accomplished finish, though the Ferriby defence allowed him ample time and space.

Ferriby’s best opening of the half came when a neat ball over the top sprung Danny Clarke who did well to hold off two defenders before forcing goalkeeper Andy Coughlin into a block at his near post.

Early in the second-half, there was encouragement for Ferriby when Jason St Juste, an international for Saint Kitts and Nevis, shrugged off Steve Tomassen and was only denied when Coughlin dived at his feet.

A minute later and Jennings should have found the net. Set clear by a brilliant through ball, he rounded goalkeeper Andy Nicklin only for Danny Hone to clear his shot off the line.

On the hour, Wrexham did claim their second. Harris, part of the team that won here two years ago, was played into acres of space on the right by Jennings, raced clear and calmly slotted the ball past Nicklin.

The goal showed how Ferriby had been stretched and Jennings nearly capitalised on a carbon copy opening minutes later, only to drag his shot wide.

Wrexham seemed to be cruising but things were back in the balance when Danny Clarke broke through the heart of the defence and was fouled as he tried to get round Coughlin.

Ferriby captain King assumed responsibility and hammered the spot-kick home to reinvigorate the match.

After that it was all Ferriby and, with four minutes left, they drew level. St Juste did well to retrieve the ball wide on the left and, cutting in from the byline, he delivered a low cross on a plate for substitute Kendall to turn home. ‘You’re not singing anymore,’ sang those from Humberside.

 Kendall is the equivalent of Wrexham’s Moult. This was his sixth in the Trophy this season after earlier strikes against Mickleover Sports, Boston United (twice), Hyde and Farnborough.

All of a sudden, Wrexham were clinging on and Clarke forced Coughlin into a fine save with a dipping shot from outside the box in stoppage time. St Juste marauded again down the left, crossed and Kendall tried to flick it in, only to be denied by Blaine Hudson’s desperate sliding block. Coasting with 15 minutes left, Wrexham were somewhat fortunate to reach extra time. 

Still Ferriby were the better side. St Juste again accelerated into space down the right and was denied by Coughlin.

And guess who was the provider for Kendall’s second in minute 100. St Juste’s ball looped up off the boot of Tomassen and found its way to Kendall for the simplest of close-range headers. Cue delirium among those wearing green and white.

Hone had saved Ferriby once and he did so again with a vital slide tackle when Andy Bishop pulled the trigger with 10 minutes left.

The Villagers were clinging on for dear life and their resistance was overcome just three minutes from time. A barrage was only half-cleared and it fell perfectly for Moult to thump home sweetly on the half-volley and ensure the drama of penalties.
