Hate preacher Abu Hamza's most trusted lieutenant will be kicked out of Britain to face terror charges in America, it was revealed today.

Following a High Court hearing in London judges have given Home Secretary Theresa May the go ahead to extradite mentally-ill Broadmoor patient Haroon Aswat.

European judges had ruled last year that the 34-year-old terror suspect, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, could not be deported because it would be bad for his mental health.

Aswat, who claims to be a schizophrenic, is wanted by the U.S. authorities for plotting to set up a jihadi training camp in Bly, Oregon. 

He said if extradited and convicted he would be at risk of ill-treatment inside the so-called supermax prison ADX Florence, in Colorado.

The  prison, which is surrounded by desert, and known as the 'Alcatraz of the Rockies' and is home to 400 of America's most dangerous convicts, where they live in a cramped cell measuring 12ft by 7ft.

Hamza and four other terror suspects were extradited two years ago after the European Court of Human Rights rejected their appeal against the move.

Hamza, Babar Ahmad, Seyla Talha Ahsan, Adel Abdul Bary and Khaled Al-Fawwaz were all then removed from the country. 

But Aswat's case was adjourned to allow judges more time to consider his mental health. 

Mr Justice Mitting, sitting at the High Court with The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, found there was 'no risk at all' of inhuman treatment in the U.S.

Claim: Aswat had claimed up to 50 years without parole in the Supermax jail in Florence, Colorado - the Alcatraz of the Rockies - would breach his human rights

Today, Mr Justice Mitting, sitting at the High Court with The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, found there was 'no risk at all' of inhuman treatment in the U.S.

The pair dismissed Aswat's bid to delay extradition.

Aswat, who was born in Batley, West Yorkshire, now faces imminent removal to the USA and a three week trial for terror offences.

He was transferred from prison to Broadmoor in 2008 suffering with paranoid schizophrenia. 

Hamza, who was serving a seven-year sentence in Britain for soliciting to murder and inciting racial hatred when he was extradited, has denied 11 counts of criminal conduct related to the taking of 16 hostages in Yemen in 1998 and advocating violent jihad in Afghanistan in 2001.

He is also accused of conspiring to establish the Oregon-based jihad training camp between June 2000 and December 2001.

Home Office officials said later that the case could yet be heard by the Supreme Court.

They said pending any Supreme Court application by Aswat's lawyers, extradition arrangements would be made.

'We are pleased the court has upheld the Home Secretary's decision to extradite Haroon Aswat to the United States,' said a Home Office spokesman.

'The court agreed that the American authorities had provided sufficient assurances over the conditions in which Aswat would be held in the U.S.

'Aswat's legal team has been given an opportunity to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. Subject to any application, arrangements will now be made for his extradition.'
