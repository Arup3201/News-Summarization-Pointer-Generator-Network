There is a new contender for dumbest criminal after a group of young men dragged stolen, flaming port-a-loos behind their car and seemed surprised by the nauseating stench that ensued.

The less-than-smooth criminals then further proved their ignorance by incriminating themselves; catching the attention of police by posting footage of their faecal fiasco on Facebook.

The young men attached chains to two port-a-loos during the dead of night and then took off at great speed, with the portable toilets banging into each other and spilling waste all over the road.

The culprits follow the ute filming the disgusting, dangerous antics.

Chains were attached to the port-a-loos, which were displaced when the connected ute took off at high-speed

The portable toilets were attached to a ute and dragged through the streets at a great speed

Sparks fly through the air as the two dunnies catch alight, swinging on both sides of the road as the utes speed through the night.

The hooligans can be heard guffawing and retching as they speed through the Northern Territory, overcome by the putrid stench as the container of waste catches alight.

‘I can smell sh**, oh God!’ the voice can be heard yelling in surprise. Others yell excitedly, giggling so hard that their exclamations are inaudible.

The flaming toilets tumble, knocking over street signs and upending any objects which came in their path.

Proving no lesson had been learnt, the Territorians tried again, stealing another port-a-loo.

‘Sh** got everywhere!’ they can be heard squealing.

Several men in the cabin can be heard retching, on the verge of vomiting as the stench fills the air.

NT Police duty superintendent Bob Harrison says he is well aware of the crime, thanks to the criminals conveniently uploading footage of their stupid stunt, according to NT News.

He condemns their deplorable actions and cannot believe that the people responsible would be so stupid to not only engage in the stunt but make the incriminating footage public.

‘I have no understanding of what makes grown men behave in such a manner, I would have to question their IQ,’ Supt Harrison told NT News.

“The fact that it emitted sparks poses a danger to anyone in the area,” he said.

“They are obviously proud of their achievement but I would say that their age matches their shoe size.”

Police are investigating the theft, the dangerous nature of the motor crime and the damage to property, including the port-a-loos and the roads.
