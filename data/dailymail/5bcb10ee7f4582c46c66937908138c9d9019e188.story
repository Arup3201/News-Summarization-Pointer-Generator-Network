Ahmad Otak today pleaded guilty to the double murder in March

An asylum-seeker today admitted stabbing to death his ex-girlfriend's 17-year-old sister and her 18-year-old friend.

Ahmad Otak, 21, murdered Kimberley Frank and her friend Samantha Sykes, 18, in Kimberley's flat in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, in March.

Otak, who is from Afghanistan, had visited Kimberley's home to discuss his stormy relationship with her sister Elisa when the murders took place.

A judge at Leeds Crown Court today warned Otak he now faces a life sentence.

Appearing via video-link from Wakefield Prison, the 21-year-old - who entered the UK in 2007 - pleaded guilty to two counts of murder, and to carrying a blade.

Judge Peter Collier said in court: 'As Iâ€™m sure you will understand, the sentence for murder is fixed by law and the sentence that will be passed on you in due course is one of life imprisonment.'

Otak denied two further charges relating to the kidnap and false imprisonment of his ex-girlfriend Elisa Frank.

Richard Mansell, prosecuting, said the pleas were acceptable to the Crown and would be left on file.

Otak also admitted carrying a kitchen knife in Wakefield on the day of the murders.

Steven Harratt, 57, of Wakefield, is 
accused of assisting an offender by giving Otak food, money, clothing 
and a satellite navigation system after the murders.

He denies the charge and was granted bail until his trial, the date of which is yet to be fixed.

Otak was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on November 9.

Otak's teenage victims were discovered at the flat in Barden Road in the Eastmoor 
area of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on March 10.

At the time bunches of flowers were left on the steps leading up to the flats, and cards were left attached to a handrail.

A card on one of the bouquets read: 'Sammy, we will miss you sooo much. You were a great friend and will never ever be forgotten. We'll see you again one day. RIP.'

West Yorkshire Police said at the time that officers 
were contacted by Kent Police after a 19-year-old woman in Dover raised 
concerns for the safety of the two women.

Officers went to the flat in Barden 
Road and discovered the bodies of Miss Frank and Miss Sykes, of 
California Drive, Horbury, West Yorkshire.

A post-mortem examination revealed the women died from stab wounds.

Miss
Frank, who spent a large part of her life in care, had lived alone in 
the ground floor flat in the Eastmoor area of Wakefield since moving in 
two months earlier.

Miss Sykes lived with her parents and younger brother, Ben, in a more affluent area of the town.
Her parents, Eric and Julie, were too upset to speak.

A police cordon was put in place and officers stood guard at the flat in Wakefield after the teenage girls' bodies were discovered in March
