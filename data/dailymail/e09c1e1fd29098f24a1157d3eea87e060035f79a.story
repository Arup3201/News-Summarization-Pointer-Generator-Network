'Systematically bullied': Sarah Mulvey was found dead by her boyfriend at their North London home after she had taken a drug overdose

A high-flying Channel 4 executive overdosed on drugs after she was 'systematically bullied' by her bosses, a coroner heard yesterday.

Sarah Mulvey, 34, who made programmes such as Ten Years Younger, Brat Camp and How To Look Good Naked with Gok Wan, was in a state of 'acute stress'.

After difficulties at work she sought treatment at the £10,000-per-week Causeway retreat.

But the Oxford graduate went into a severe decline at the clinic in Osea Island, Essex, used by stars such as Amy Winehouse. It is believed that while staying there she obtained the drugs she later used to kill herself.

Sarah's boyfriend Mark Gillett discovered her dead in their £350,000 two-bedroom rented flat in Hampstead, North London, in January last year after she had taken an overdose.

Her father, Dr Christopher Mulvey, told the inquest at St Pancras Coroners Court that treatment had 'made matters worse' for Sarah.

When asked why she had gone to the Causeway, Dr Mulvey, a mathematician at Sussex University, replied: 'She had been systematically bullied by her bosses at Channel 4.'

But he was stopped by coroner Dr Andrew Reid who said that Channel 4 had not been listed as interested parties.

It was recognised that the commissioning editor was off sick, and was in redundancy and grievance negotiations with her bosses.

Paul
Spencer, representing the Mulvey family, said that she had mentioned 
the year-long bullying to clinicians and it 'potentially led to the 
circumstances of her death'.

Dr
Reid said that the cause of her death in January last year had been 
established as opiate toxicity, and questioned where she might have got 
the drugs.

Sarah's father said there was 'evidence from a number of her friends that at the Causeway there was 'a fairly easy access to the drugs that were held, presumably for clinical use.'

Dr Mulvey said: 'In April 2009 she was working absolutely full pelt. She was an extremely hard worker because she loved her job.

'She was able to function in a high-achieving way right up to the point when she said "Enough, I have to take some time out and I need to take it somewhere where I can have treatment to help me recover as quickly as possible so I can return to the job I love".'

The inquest was told that after spending four months at the Causeway she was asked to leave.

Her father added that she was in a 'terrible state'.

She was allowed to return home after being assessed by NHS mental health teams in North London.

Dr
Mulvey said Sarah had been suffering from stress since early 2008 as a 
result of the 'unpredictable and aggressive working situation' she 
experienced at Channel 4.

Brendan Quinn, a registered nurse and director of the clinic which has since been closed and been fined for not having registration, denied that Miss Mulvey had 'stockpiled' the drugs she overdosed on when at the clinic.

He said staff were 'highly qualified', they also had 'robust' measures to ensure drugs were administered properly.

Miss Mulvey was a problem patient who had 'categorically refused' to leave despite the advice of staff, he added.

The inquest was adjourned for further investigations to see whether the clinic had access to drugs which the television executive could have stockpiled.

The case will resume early in the new year.

A spokesman for Channel 4 said: 'We feel very deeply for Sarah’s family and partner at this difficult time.

'Sarah’s tragic death shocked and saddened everyone who knew her at Channel 4.

'Since then we have worked with the Mulvey family to support them and to celebrate Sarah’s career and achievements.

'As the inquest has been adjourned until 2012 and it would not be appropriate for us to comment any further at this time.'
