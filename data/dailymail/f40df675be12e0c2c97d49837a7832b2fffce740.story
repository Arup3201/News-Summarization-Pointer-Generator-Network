Survivors of the Himalayan trekking tragedy told yesterday how they faced the life or death dilemma of whether to stay in a flimsy teahouse at 17,000ft or brave a killer blizzard.

Around 100 people, including many inexperienced trekkers, took refuge in the wooden shack after a sudden snowstorm on the popular Annapurna Circuit.

The teahouse’s owner told trekkers they were putting their lives in danger if they stayed.

He then declared he was shutting the shop near the Thorung La Pass and, it is claimed, demanded 1,000 Nepali rupees – around £6.30 – each to guide them to the nearest village, Muktinath.

Some decided to stay behind after he agreed to leave the lodge open and, despite a cold and hungry night, survived.

But most set off behind him and several died – amid claims he abandoned them when the deadly blizzards and avalanches took hold last week.

Yesterday Kobi Megreli, 24, an Israeli medical student who was among those who opted to stay in the teahouse, said: ‘I don’t trust someone who asks me for money to save my life.

‘My friends who went with him told me the owner had left them halfway down. In the snow. In the storm. He left them because they were too exhausted to continue.’

The search for survivors of the devastating storm in which at least 39 people died was called off by rescuers in Nepal yesterday as they began focusing instead on looking for bodies trapped in the snow.

More than 500 people, including 230 tourists, have been rescued from the Annapurna mountain range trail, which is nicknamed the ‘apple pie’ circuit because the lodges along the route sell home-baked food.

Fears remain for at least three Britons who were in the area and are still listed as ‘missing’ on a website set up by local rescuers.

Their names are Martin Warner, Katie Hill and Jay Devine. Last night the website said that Christopher Pugh, whose name had been on the missing list, was safe.

Several others whose names appeared on that list have since contacted home to say they are safe and well – and, in some cases, that they were not near the disaster scene.

Jade House, from Liphook, Hampshire and her boyfriend Oliver De Paolis, from London, both 24, contacted their families to say they had been in another part of the Himalayas when disaster struck.

Nigel Vardy, 46, of Belper, Derbyshire – known as Mr Frostbite after losing his fingers on a previous adventure – has also contacted his family to say he is safe.

Yesterday Briton Andrew Kimmerling, 54, who was on honeymoon in Nepal with his Danish wife Suzanne and had been feared dead, turned up safe and well.

Management consultant Mr Kimmerling, who moved to France 15 years ago from Cambridgeshire, contacted relatives by text and phone call to say that he and his wife are both fine.

Peter Roddis, 26, an electrical engineer, from Hove, East Sussex, has contacted his family to say he was not in the mountains when disaster struck on the 150-mile trail, which loops round Annapurna, the world’s tenth tallest peak.

The Foreign Office said yesterday that it has still received no information about any British injured or dead. The dead include Canadian, Indian, Israeli, Japanese, Nepalese, Polish and Slovak trekkers. Mr Megreli told The Sunday Times of the terrible dilemma in the teahouse after he was discharged from a hospital in Kathmandu, the Nepalese capital, with only minor injuries.

He and the others who refused to pay to be led down the mountain made it to safety the next morning after ‘huddling together for warmth’ and not sleeping for fear of hypothermia. They walked to an area where military helicopters flew them to Kathmandu.

Eitan Edan, 31, an Israeli social worker who followed the teahouse owner but survived and is being treated for frostbite, said: ‘They let us think we had to walk if we wanted to stay alive, but everyone who stayed in the teashop lived.’ Four of his friends died, he added.

The fate of the teahouse owner was not clear last night.

Reports locally said Pasang Tamang, a porter who had earlier been hired by some of those in the teahouse to help them on the trek, was hailed a hero after dying having rescued more than 20 stranded people during the descent.

But some survivors have claimed the 45-year-old father of two, who was reportedly paid £9 a day, made a deal with the teahouse owner to share the trekkers’ ‘escape payments’. He died of suffocation and exhaustion during the descent.

His employer, Laxman Ghimire, said 22,500 rupees (£141) and $100 was recovered from his body, which he had earned on his previous trek.
