Rick Warren's youngest son, Matthew, has committed suicide at the age of 27 after a long battle with depression.

The Orange County Sheriff Coroner's 
office told the MailOnline that the estimated time of death was Friday 
at 10am and said he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The evangelical pastor of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California revealed his son's death to his church on Saturday.

'No words can express the anguished grief we feel right now,' the pastor told his congregation in a statement, pleading for their prayers as the family mourned.

The distraught father revealed in a statement that Matthew had struggled with mental illness from a young age, experiencing 'dark holes of depression, and even suicidal thoughts.'

Despite countless doctors and medication, 'the torture of mental illness never subsided.'

'Kay and I often marveled at his courage to keep moving in spite of relentless pain. I'll never forget how, many years ago, after another approach had failed to give relief, Matthew said "Dad, I know I¹m going to heaven. Why can't I just die and end this pain?" but he kept going for another decade,' the grieving pastor continued.

Rick Warren is married to Kay, who is active in her husband's ministry, and they have two other adult children, Amy and Joshua, and five grandchildren.

The pastor remembered his youngest child for his 'brilliant intellect and a gift for sensing who was most in pain or most uncomfortable in a room.'

He said that the tragic event occurred after Matthew had spent time with the couple on Thursday.

'In a momentary wave of despair at his home [in Mission Viejo, Calif.], he took his life.'

The Coroner's office said that an autopsy would be conducted next week on either Monday or Tuesday.

Dr Warren frequently communicates via his Twitter account but did not post any messages on Friday.

On Saturday afternoon, he posted this tweet referencing the Lord's Prayer.

'We pray 'Thy WILL be done on earth AS IT IS IN HEAVEN' since in heaven God's will is done #always. On earth, it's done rarely,' seemingly in response to the family's tragic loss.

The church said in a statement that they were 'deeply grieved for the loss of Pastor Rick and Kay Warren upon hearing of the death of their youngest son, Matthew.'

'Our church family has had the privilege of ministering together with the Warrens and their family, all of whom have been lifelong members of Saddleback, over the last 33 years.'

Politics: Rick Warren hosted the Civil Forum on The Presidency, attended by both Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and then Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) at Saddleback Church in August 2008 during the 2008 presidential election

Scores of tributes poured in on social media, with supporters posting words of encouragement and prayers to the Saddleback Facebook page.

'Our hearts ache for you. We love you and are holding you close in our prayers. God bless you and give you strength,' one mourner wrote, with another adding, 'Matthew is home, free of all the pain he felt.' 

'All I can think is that he wants his parents to have a happy last memory. He's with God and he is whole again.'

Megachurch pastor Greg Laurie lost his 33-year-old son in a car crash in 2008 and offered his condolences to the Warren family.

'At times like these, there really are no words, but there is the Word. There is no manual, but there is Emmanuel,' he said in a statement on the Gospel Coalition website.

Grieving: Pastor Warren posted this message to his more than 900,000 Twitter followers on Saturday

Warren, 59, is one of the leading voices in the evangelical movement in America.

His
church, located in Orange County, is ranked the seventh largest 
congregation in the U.S. with an average weekly attendance of 20,000.

The Southern Baptist pastor authored the Purpose Driven Life, a devotional study book, that was published in 2002 and became a New York Times bestseller, selling over 32 million copies as it exploded as a popular trend among conservative Christians.

He has taken an active role in promoting social justice and even hosted the Civil Forum on The Presidency, attended by both Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and then Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) during the 2008 presidential election.

Pastor Warren was also selected to deliver the invocation at President Obama's 2009 inauguration.

Kay Warren helped her husband establish the evangelical church in 1980.

She has openly discussed her personal struggle with depression and overcoming sexual abuse in her childhood.

Though the spiritual leaders never publicly detailed their youngest son's struggle, Kay did tell Christianity Today in an interview last April that 'a loved one was struggling with a mental illness' on the same day that Rick Warren delivered his prayer at Obama's inauguration in 2009. 

She authored a book about overcoming adversity, Choose Joy: Because Happiness Isn't Enough, about finding victory over despair through faith in Christ.

'Suffering does give one an appreciation for joy,' she told the Christian magazine in 2012.

'Those who have suffered have been given the opportunity to recognize the limitations of ourselves and to know God in our darkest days.'
