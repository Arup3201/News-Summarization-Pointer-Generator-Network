Eric Malcolm attacked his lodger with booby trap after a row over Sky TV

An 'irrational' landlord tried to electrocute his lodger with a booby-trap after an argument over his tenant's satellite TV subscription.

Eric Malcolm, from Royston, Hertfordshire, wrapped a live 240-volt extension cable round his living room door handle in a bid to electrocute Tony Gilesnan, before hitting the tenant over the head with a hammer.

Mr Gilesnan, who had only been living with Malcolm for three days, received only a mild shock from the handle, but was left with a three-inch gash on the head after the hammer blow.

The pair had rowed about a Sky TV package in the property before Malcolm, 33, carried out the attack, which a court heard 'could have killed' Mr Gilesnan.

Cambridge Crown Court heard that after seeing lodger Mr Gilesnan receive only a small shock, Malcolm told him: 'You should be on the floor with the 240 volts I had put through you.

The court heard evidence from an 
electrician confirming that, if Malcolm had set up the trap properly, it
could have seriously injured or killed Mr Gilesnan.

Malcolm had previously pleaded guilty to administering a noxious substance to Mr Gilesnan, namely 240 volts of electricity, so as to endanger his life, and also admitted grievous bodily harm.

Row: Mr Malcolm and Mr Gilesnan had argued over the property's satellite TV package

The court was told the pair had set up a tenancy agreement and Mr Gilesnan had put down three months' rent and a deposit totalling Â£1,200 before they disagreed about their satellite TV.

The row was resolved but later escalated again when Malcolm wrongly thought his tenant had used his computer and broken one of his trophies.

It was after this new row that Malcolm went downstairs in the property and set up the trap, with Mr Gilesnan following shortly after.

Rebecca Smith, prosecuting, said Mr 
Gilesnan felt a 'tingle' as he touched the door handle before entering 
the room, and then 'felt a sharp blow to the back of his head.

'He turned and saw that he had had a hammer in his hand,' she told the court.

After
a struggle Mr Gilesnan managed to grab the weapon and called the 
emergency services. He suffered a three-inch cut to his head after the 
attack on April 28 this year.

Malcolm, who the court heard had a 
problem with his temper, was said to have felt intimidated by his new 
tenant, despite having had few problems over the previous 10 years with 
14 lodgers.

He was jailed for four years after a judge told him the attack was a 'wholly irrational act'.

Judge Gareth Hawkesworth said Malcolm was unpredictable and may commit further violent offences in the future.
