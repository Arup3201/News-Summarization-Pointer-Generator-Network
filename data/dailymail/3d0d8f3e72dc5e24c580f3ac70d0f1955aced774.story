Britain's oldest poppy seller, and the country's oldest surviving former Royal Marine, has died at the age of 102.

Albert Joyner, who had five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, raised more than £15,000 for the Royal British Legion by selling poppies.

Mr Joyner, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, was sent to fight on HMS Curacoa at the outbreak of the Second World War.

It was bombed by the Luftwaffe in April 1940 and he was later involved in the evacuation of Singapore and supported the landings during the Allied invasion of Italy in 1943.

Mr Joyner, who spent the past 11 years selling poppies, sadly died on Thursday.

His daughter, Pam Ruppe, described Mr Joyner, of Keighley, West Yorkshire, as a family man and a perfectionist.

She said: ‘He was a very social man, right up to the end. He liked to be with people. He liked a sing-song, that stays in your memories.

‘He has been a pretty healthy man all his life and he was still quite strong at the end.’

Speaking in 2011, Mr Joyner said: ‘I've been very lucky. Lots of other servicemen and women have not been as lucky as me.

‘I'm determined to do my bit to remember those who are no longer with us and support those who have fought on the front line.’

Mr Joyner, who lived at Herncliffe Nursing Home in Keighley, retired in 1956, holding the rank of Colour Sergeant.

He went on to become president of Bradford and District Royal Marines Association.

Keighley's Royal British Poppy Appeal organiser Tommy Thompson said: ‘He was a real stalwart.

‘He was a popular, long-time member of the Legion and always supported the poppy appeal, raising a huge amount of money for the cause.’

His funeral - a military occasion - is to be held at 1.30pm on Friday March 28 at United Reformed Church in Riddlesden.
