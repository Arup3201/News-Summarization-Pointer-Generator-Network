Just one day after flight delays caused by a computer glitch led to fist fights at an airport outside of London, a similar computer glitch grounded flights at several California airports on Wednesday.

The glitch apparently hit the Los Angeles Center air traffic facility about 2:20 p.m., which forced officials to ground departing flights at several southern California airports, including Los Angeles International Airport, Bob Hope Airport in Burbank and John Wayne Airport in Orange County.

'Arrivals continue to be accepted but departures are being held on 
ground. No ETA on when it will be lifted,' read a post on LAX's 
Twitter page.

Delays: A computer glitch forced aviation officials to ground flights out of several airports in Los Angeles, including LAX

Glitch: Bob Hope Airport in Burbank also was forced to ground departing flights due to the glitch

The Federal Aviation Administration issued a press release explaining the delays.

'Los Angeles Center air traffic control facility experienced technical 
issues and stopped accepting additional flights into the airspace 
managed by the facility for about an hour.

'Some flights were 
diverted and the agency issued a nationwide ground stop for flights 
heading into the airspace managed by the center. The agency is gradually
 restoring the system,' the FAA said.

A spokesperson for the FAA assured CNN that the control center's radar was not down during the delays.

Orange County's John Wayne Airport also experienced delays, which led to backups at airports across the southwest

The glitch impacted airports throughout the southwest, with hour-long delays at Las Vegas' McCarran Airport and Salt Lake City International Airport. 

On Tuesday, chaos broke out at Gatwick Airport - about 30 miles south of London - after a computer glitch caused delays at several airports in Great Britain, including Heathrow.

Furious travellers described the scenes as ‘a disgrace and a national embarrassment,' with 
many complaining about a lack of information.

One
 passenger at Gatwick reported that passengers were turning violent. Kay
 Perry tweeted: ‘Gatwick airport chaos. Fights break out among 
passengers as queues reach for miles.’

Chaos: A similar glitch caused much lengthier delays at airports across the UK, which reportedly led to fist fights at Gatwick Airport

Another
 posting mocked the airport, saying: ‘Well done Heathrow airport. I’ve 
spent longer in this immigration queue than in the air.'

The delays at the U.S. airports did not include fist fights - and departing flights resumed about an hour after the glitch was first noticed.
