A tree trimmer died in a freak accident when a stray branch hit him on the head and led to him suffocating 60ft off the ground.

Father-to-be Tim June, 21, from Roswell, Georgia, died of asphyxiation caused by 'head and neck compression' on Saturday while working on a pine tree in Fairburn.

Sergeant Anthony Bazydlo, a spokesman for the Fairburn Police Department, revealed that when officers turned up they were left confused at first by the cause of death.

Police initially thought the force of the branch hitting Mr June had killed him. But pathologists later ruled he died of asphyxiation, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Following an emergency call, firefighters from the Fairburn Fire Department were dispatched to the scene and managed to remove Mr June's body from the tree and take him to a waiting ambulance.

'It took some doing to bring him down,' said Sgt Bazydlo. 'This is the definition of a tragic accident.'

Mr June, who had worked as a tree trimmer for three years, was the owner of Atlanta Tree Assurance, founded last year.

His 21-year-old girlfriend, Sarah Docekal, who is nine months pregnant, said he was an accomplished arborist.

'We were going to give it [the child] up for adoption,' she told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'Now, I may change my mind.'

Mother Susan Coker, of Marietta said by the time he was 14, he was cutting grass and cleaning gutters for cash. Then he discovered tree cutting.

'He finally decided he could make more money as the boss instead of working for the boss,' his mother said.
