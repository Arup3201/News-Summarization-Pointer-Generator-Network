Nigel Farage was locked in a bitter war of words with the Conservatives last night over the credibility of a defector with links to a convicted kidnapper.

The anti-EU party had been left licking its wounds on Saturday night when Ukip MEP Amjad Bashir announced he was leaving for the Tories.

But Mr Farage hit back yesterday, saying Mr Bashir had already been facing suspension over a string of issues, including claims that he had links to a man jailed for his involvement in a kidnap plot in Pakistan and alleged expenses irregularities.

The Ukip leader launched an all-out assault on Mr Bashir’s record, claiming party officials had been ‘increasingly alarmed by his behaviour over the past few months’.

He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show that Mr Bashir ‘didn’t tell us the truth’ about the alleged employment of illegal immigrants in his restaurant business and warned there are ‘some big open questions in Brussels about money’.

There were also claims of interference in candidate selection in Keighley, West Yorkshire, and links with ‘political extremists’ from Pakistan.

Ukip suspended Mr Bashir on Saturday evening after getting wind that he was about to defect. The MEP, who was once paraded by Ukip as a symbol of the party’s diversity, yesterday accused his former leader of a ‘desperate attempt’ to smear him. 

Mr Bashir said there was ‘not a shred of truth’ in the allegations made against him. He claimed last night that Mr Farage had even asked him to stand for Parliament last week – a claim dismissed by Ukip last night as ‘risible’.

Mr Farage said he was ‘genuinely surprised’ the Conservatives had accepted Mr Bashir into the party.

In a further twist last night, Respect MP George Galloway claimed his party de-selected Mr Bashir as a council candidate ahead of the 2012 local elections.

The Bradford West MP refused to say what the issues were that led to Mr Bashir’s sacking ‘but they were sufficiently grave to make us realise that he was not a fit and proper person to represent Respect’.

He added: ‘Clearly both Ukip and the Tories have lower standards.’

A Tory source last night said Mr Bashir denied ever having any involvement with the Left-wing Respect party.

Four million EU citizens living in the UK should be barred from voting in a referendum on Britain’s relationship with Europe, Nigel Farage said yesterday.

Setting out his terms for a post-election deal with the Conservatives, the Ukip leader claimed he wanted ‘fair’ rules for the In/Out ballot pledged by David Cameron.

Mr Farage said: ‘I want a guarantee that the only people that can vote are British citizens because at the moment there are four million or so EU citizens living in Britain.’

Currently, EU citizens can vote in local and European elections, and in referendums – many took part in last year’s Scottish independence vote. 

But Eurosceptics believe they could sway the result in favour of Britain staying in the EU.

Mr Bashir’s defection was presented as a major coup by the Conservatives, who are trying to squeeze Ukip’s vote ahead of the General Election. David Cameron said he was ‘absolutely delighted’ by the Yorkshire and Humber MEP’s decision.

Tory party chairman Grant Shapps yesterday brushed aside claims against Mr Bashir, which include his on-going friendship with Mujeeb Bhutto, who was sentenced to seven years in jail in the UK after admitting his role as the head of a kidnapping gang in Pakistan.

Ukip claimed Mr Bashir had failed to end his association with Bhutto, despite warnings last year.

But Mr Shapps defended him, saying: ‘I’m absolutely satisfied that this is somebody mainstream... I’m absolutely satisfied that he is a very moderate MEP who has seen that the only way to deliver what he wants is through the Conservatives.’

He added that ‘they [Ukip] want you to believe that they were going to get rid of this guy, exactly the opposite is the case’.

Mr Bashir claimed Mr Farage ‘runs the party like a dictator’ and said the party had ‘outlived its usefulness’ because the Tories were now the best hope of a referendum on Europe.

He said: ‘I have decided to leave Ukip because it has become a vanity project for Nigel Farage and because many of the criticisms made of the party are true. David Cameron famously said that Ukip was a party of “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists”.

‘Certainly, I have experienced racism in Ukip. I have been racially abused on social media by other Ukip members who ask offensive questions like, “Are you a Muslim?” ’

Ukip denied he had been subjected to racism. Party sources said allegations of financial irregularities in Brussels would be passed to police.

How this election coup turned into a debacle for Dave

A series of controversies in the political life of Ukip turncoat Amjad Bashir should have set alarm bells ringing among the Tory high command.

But questionable behaviour, dating back nearly a year, was either missed or overlooked by the Conservatives in their haste to secure a high-profile defector to their cause.

The resulting controversy has overshadowed what should have been a major coup for David Cameron.

In February 2014, Mr Bashir was ordered by Ukip to break off all relations with a friend, political activist Mujeeb Bhutto, after it was revealed Bhutto had a conviction for leading a kidnapping gang in Pakistan.

Despite this, Mr Bashir was seen with Bhutto earlier this month at a hustings in Keighley, West Yorkshire, where there are allegations of vote-rigging that are now the subject of an internal inquiry.

In July last year, the Pakistani-born businessman was again warned about his political associates. 

As recently as last week, the Ukip MEP was summoned to a meeting with party leader Nigel Farage where he was due to be handed an ‘ultimatum’ over his conduct following the incident in Keighley.

Ukip allege that he did not show up, although Mr Bashir claimed last night that Mr Farage had made no mention of an ultimatum and had instead invited him to stand for Parliament.

The colourful allegations against Mr Bashir should have been enough to raise concerns – or at least provoke further investigation – at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ). Yet it appears that any questions over his behaviour or political associations were swept aside by the Tories in their rush to secure his defection.

Three days later, Mr Bashir confirmed to his Tory contacts that he was prepared to jump ship from Ukip. A hurried meeting was arranged with David Cameron before the Prime Minister flew to Saudi Arabia for the funeral of King Abdullah.

CCHQ also arranged a secretly recorded and embargoed interview with the BBC to be rolled out on announcement of the news.

But the next day at 4pm Ukip somehow learned of Mr Bashir’s defection plans. Within an hour and a half it was announced he was being suspended pending investigations into ‘extremely serious’ allegations. Ukip also began to ‘accelerate’ disciplinary proceedings against their MEP.

Half an hour later, the party formally received his resignation and his defection was confirmed.

But thanks to Ukip’s intervention, and the resulting row, a series of pre-arranged interviews with broadcasters were cancelled by the Tories.

The end result was a botched defection which risks leaving CCHQ with egg on its face amid questions over what, if any, due diligence had been carried out by Tory planners on their new recruit.
