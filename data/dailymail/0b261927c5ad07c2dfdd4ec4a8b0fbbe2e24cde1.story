A home owner is being forced to trespass to reach his front door because the council sold his front garden.

Mark Durant and three neighbours were shocked to learn in February that strips of land they'd rented for the last 25 years in Canvey, Essex, were being sold.

The sale has now taken place and the neighbours say they are locked in an 'anxious waiting game' as they still have no idea who won the bid and what lies in store for their gardens.

Mark Durant, 41, is now technically trespassing on his front garden, which is the only way he can access the front door of his property.

Before the sale went ahead he said: 'I would technically be trespassing across someone else's land to get to my front door. What if the owner refused to let me access my own home? What would I do?'

Four strips of land in Marine Parade, Beck Road and Zider Pass in Canvey were sold at a London auction in February for Â£4,800 to a private bidder after Essex County Council put them up for sale.

Mike Bering, 61, of Marine Parade, said: 'Poor Mark over the road has got to walk over that land every day to get to his house, and you never know the new owner could just turn around and forbid him access.

'Since the auction we have heard nothing from the council and are still none the wiser about who owns it. It's just a waiting game to see who turns up and what they decide to do.

'The worst thing is, whatever happens we have no control over it and have to look down on it from our windows.'

Despite being located on three separate roads, the plots were sold as a single lot in the sale by Lambert Smith Hampton.

The four families, who had been renting the land for up to 25 years, rallied together to bid for the plots but were outbid but an unknown buyer.

Jean Graham, 65, of Beck Road said: 'We are all really anxious to find out what's going on.

'All we know was it was sold to a private individual. We wanted to try and buy it but there was a limit to how much we could afford especially considering solicitors fees and insurance, which is a shame.'

An Essex County Council spokesman 'While we appreciate the residents' situation, the land concerned is Essex County Council land, and this would have been made clear when the houses were bought.

'Essex County Council, through our agents, visited all of the auction sites and where possible made contact with all those with an interest in the land.

'Essex County Council is awaiting completion of the purchase through the buyer's solicitors, and once the sale is complete the owner's details will be a matter of public record at the Land Registry.

'In the meantime, the council provided the buyers' solicitor's details on 3rd April to a Canvey Island resident following a direct request. It is usual for the buyers to be represented by a solicitor or agent, and we cannot force a third party to talk to the residents.'
