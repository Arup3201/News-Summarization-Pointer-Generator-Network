'Britain's Schindler': Sir Nicholas Winton, who is to awarded the Czech Republic's Order of the White Lion for saving children from the Nazi occupation

A Briton who saved Jews in occupied Prague from almost certain death in Nazi concentration camps is to be awarded the Czech Republic's highest honour.

Sir Nicholas Winton, who saved more than 650 mostly Jewish children from the Holocaust by organising the 'Kindertransports' to the UK, will receive the Order of the White Lion.

His exploits just before the outbreak of total war in Europe made him a hero to the Czechs and have earned him the nickname 'Britain's Schindler'.

The award, confirmed this week, will be given to the 105-year-old at an official ceremony on October 28, the anniversary of the founding of Czechoslovakia.

Sir Nicholas recently celebrated his 105th birthday at the Czech embassy in London where most of the guests were the offspring of the children rescued by him.

Taking into the account the children of those he saved, there are estimated to be around 6,000 people in the world today who owe him their lives.

To this day they call themselves 'Nicky's children'.

It was late in December 1938 when Sir Nicholas from Hampstead, then a stockbroker, cancelled a holiday and instead went to Prague to see what was happening to refugees.

Horrified by the treatment of the Jews under the Nazi occupation, he set about  organising eight evacuations of the threatened children on the Czech Kindertransport train.

He advertised in newspapers for foster homes, organised residency permits from the immigration office in the UK, and persuaded the Germans to let the children go.

Vera Egermayer, a Holocaust survivor who was interned at the Theresienstadt transit camp, said: 'Nicky is a national hero in the Czech Republic.

'In England, you don’t know about him but everywhere else we do. He did a kind act and never told anybody.'

Sir Nicholas still lives in his own home in Berkshire, with only a day carer.

At his birthday party, he said: 'I am always surprised every time I come here to see all kinds of people who have come really very great distances to say hello.

'As far as I am concerned, it is only Anno Domini that I am fighting - I am not ill, I am just old and doddery.'
