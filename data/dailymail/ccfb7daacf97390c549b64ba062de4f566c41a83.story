Basketball superstar Kobe Bryant has become the latest household name to sign up to China's answer to Twitter.

Twitter, which has around 500 million users worldwide has been banned in China since 2009 - along with a number of other western websites, including the video-sharing site You Tube.

Mr Bryant's first message on Sina Weibo read: 'Valentine's day sneaks ready to break Clippers hearts. Big game tonight.' Sina Weibo verified that the NBA 
superstar has set up an individual account on the site.

Basketball's Sina Weibo account, named Black Mamba, which read: 'Hey it's Kobe, I've decided to take over Nike basketball's Weibo 
handle for a few days and I wanted to wish you all a Happy New Year.'

Mr Bryant

Yao Ming. During the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, billboards featuring Mr Bryant dominated China's commercial districts.

The Los Angeles Lakers star already has several fans pages on Sina Weibo. One
of them — 'Home of Kobe' — has more than 200,000 followers. Along with
