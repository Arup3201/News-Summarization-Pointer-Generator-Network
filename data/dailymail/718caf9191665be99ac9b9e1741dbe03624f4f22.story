The same group of grannies who created the famous play-by-play of Kim Kardashian's sex tape are back with another hilarious video.

This time, the 'Golden Sisters' are doing their interpretation of the Miley Cyrus twerking video.

Twins Terry and Josie, 74, and their 82-year-old sister Mary are shown sitting at the kitchen table watching the video of Miley gyrating in a unicorn suit - and debating whether they are too old to imitate her dance moves.

'I would definitely be good at it if I was a teenager and I practiced,' Josie insisted. 'I practiced the Watusi, and I got that.' 

'That would turn a guy on,' she adds.

Terry, however, isn't convinced. 'Listen, you have to have a young ass to do that,' she argues. 'Your asses are old!'

The grannies then do their best 
impression of Miley's moves: They pop their hips, squat, bounce, and try
to work their way down to the ground.

At the end one of the sisters, whose video skits have snagged them thousands of fans and a show on OWN, was heard 
saying 'that's a workout!'

According to Wikipedia, twerking is a 'dance move that involves a person shaking their upper hips and lower 
hips in an up and down bouncing motion, causing them to shake, wobble and jiggle'.

It was introduced into hip-hop culture by way of the New Orleans bounce 
music scene, and became popular after it was shown in the video for DJ 
Jubilee's 'Do the Jubilee All'.

Over the years, the trend has gone from the strip clubs of Houston and Atlanta to mainstream music culture.

The twerking video of Miley Cyrus dancing in a onesie got more than 6 million hits on YouTube.

But she's only the latest in a long line of celebrities including Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Demi Lovato and Harry Styles who have gotten in on the hip-hop dance trend.

'I can't believe how many people think 
I'm good at twerking—which is dope—like my life goal has been 
accomplished,' she told radio host Ryan Seacrest.

'I thought it was so weird, but 
I'm glad that everyone understands my humour.'

'You
can't really explain [twerking],' Miley said during the interview. 
'It's something that comes naturally…It's a lot of booty action.'

There are also hundreds of videos on YouTube taken of ordinary people twerking at locations including libraries, parking lots, and Wal Mart.

The dance craze has also seen its share of controversy: In 2013, 33 students from Scripps Ranch HIgh School were suspended for using school equipment to make a twerking video on school grounds that was later uploaded to YouTube.
