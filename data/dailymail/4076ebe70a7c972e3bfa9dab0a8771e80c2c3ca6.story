The president of programming network GitHub has resigned from the company he cofounded in 2008 following an investigation into workplace bullying and sexism.

Tom Preston-Werner stepped down on Monday from the website, which is used for sharing and collaborating software codes.

His departure follows allegations that surfaced last month concerning disrepect and intimidation to women at the start-up.

Software designer and GitHub developer Julie Ann Horvath recently made a high-profile exit from the company that sent ripples through the tech community, claiming she had been mistreated by Preston-Werner and his wife Theresa, who does not work at GitHub but was a fixture in the office.

Julie Ann Horvath, a well-known engineer at GitHub, a successful social network for coders, says a toxic workplace forced her out

GitHub engineer Julie Ann Horvath quit last month and has been airing her story on Twitter

While the couple were cleared of any legal wrongdoing in Horvath's harrassment claim following an internal investigation, an independent third-party inquiry found 'evidence of mistakes and errors of judgement' by Preston-Werner and his wife, Gawker reported.

GutHub CEO Chris Wanstharth announced Preston-Werner was leaving in a blog post, describing the allegations against the couple as 'sexual or gender-based harassment or retaliation, or of a sexist or hostile work environment'.

'In light of these findings, Tom has submitted his resignation, which the company has accepted,' Wanstharth wrote.

'Tom has been a huge part of this company from the very beginning and we appreciate all that he has done for GitHub.

'We wish him the best in his next endeavour.'

Horvath has not publicly named the colleagues that prompted her to leave, however in a detailed interview with TechCrunch she described her version of what happened.

The story centered around the wife of one of GitHub's founders who asked her out for drinks and immediately started telling her how she 'informs her husband's decision' at the company and is essentially in charge of the firing and hiring.

Outgoing GitHub president Tom Preston-Werner said on Monday that although he had 'made mistakes', he would fight any allegations made against him or his wife 'to the full extent of the law'

Horvath said the wife organized the meeting with her to ensure she wouldn't leave the company and bad-mouth them.

What followed, she claims, was a series of alleged intimidations, mostly from the wife, who continally showed up at the office, which made her feel like she was being pressured to quit.

Horvath also said that her attempts to have people at GitHub - HR, other cofounders - help the situation were useless.

She responded to Preston-Werner's resignation with some posts on Twitter.

'Bullying someone into quitting: Illegal,' Horvath wrote.

She also Tweeted: 'Pushing women with strong opinions out of your company because they disagree with you is wrong.'

But Wanstrath maintained there was no proof of any wrongdoing, according to The New York Times.

He did however acknowledge that GitHub was in the process of transforming itself.

Julie Ann Horvath, a former GitHub software developer, has gone on to start a program to improve the treatment of women within the tech world after leaving the company last month

'We want to create a great place to work for all our employees and we can't do that without acknowledging the challenges that exist in providing an inclusive work environment,' he said.

'We are implementing a number of new HR and employee-led initiatives as well as training opportunities to make sure employee concerns and conflicts are taken seriously and dealt with appropriately.

'We know we still have work to do.'

Preston-Werner on Monday wrote that while he had 'made mistakes' he was 'prepared to fight any further false claims on this matter to the full extent of the law'.

Women account for only one-fifth of software engineers.

Horvath is working on a program called Passion Projects that aims to improve the situation of women in tech.

It is being devleoped within a new organization called Playing with Possibility and is expanding to New York and Chicago.

According to Business Insider, a 2012 valuation of GitHub said the company was worth $750 million.
