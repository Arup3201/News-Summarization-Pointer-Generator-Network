This is the unbelievable moment a Saudi man is filmed texting on his phone from the bonnet of a car as it speeds along a motorway at 50mph.

The fearless stunt shows the man stretching out, relaxing and even kicking his feet in the air as he sits on the front of vehicle.

The incredible footage has quickly become a hit online and has been viewed more than 1.1million times since it was posted on YouTube last week.

Nonchalant: The man sits hunched over his phone from the bonnet of a car as it speeds along the motorway

Sit back and relax: Seemingly unconcerned by the speed of the vehicle, the daredevil lies back on the windscreen

Showing off: Not content with his display of courage, the man kicks his legs in the air to make the experience even more hair-raising

The footage appears to have been shot from another car as it approaches the vehicle travelling in the outside lane of a highway in Saudi Arabia.

The camera shows the speedometer which suggests the car is travelling at around 80kph (around 50mph).

As the camera pulls alongside, the daredevil performer can be seen, wearing traditional Saudi dress, hunched over a mobile phone on the bonnet of the car.

For more than a minute, he sits back, lies on the windscreen and even kicks his legs in the air.Â 

Crazy: The performer splays his legs in the air and lies back on the windscreen with seemingly no fear for his life

No fear: In a final demonstration of bravado, the man kneels up on the bonnet and leans his elbows on the roof of the car

Man overboard: As the camera approaches the man is clearly visible sitting on the front of the car

The car has to move over as traffic 
begins to build up, but in a final death-defying stunt the man turns 
around and kneels up with arms on the roof.

The camera then falls behind and leaves at the next exit.

It is unclear whether those filming the performance were part of the act or passed it by coincidence.

The footage is just the latest to capture Saudi adrenaline junkies performing stunts in their cars.

Recently young men have taken to 'sidewalk skiiing' - a new craze which involves gripping onto the outside of a car as it drives along on two wheels.

A large middle-Eastern country made up largely of desert, Saudi Arabia has plenty of open road for fearless riders to practice.
