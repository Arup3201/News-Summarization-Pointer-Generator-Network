At 24 years old, Republican candidate Jordan Haskins is facing an uphill battle to win a seat in Michigan state House long held by Democrats, but his young age and party affiliation are the least of his problems.

The baby-faced aspiring politician is currently on parole after serving prison time for a series of bizarre, sexually motivated break-ins he had committed in Saginaw - the same area he now seeks to represent in the state House.

Haskins' criminal record includes trespassing on private and public property in four cases from April 2010 to January 2011, when he was sent to prison. As part of the break-ins, he damaged vehicles as a way to enable what he told police was a sexual fetish.

His highly unusual proclivities had earned Haskins two misdemeanor charges of unlawful use of a motor vehicle and destruction of property after the Saginaw man broke into a state parking lot, pulled spark plugs and wires out of police cruises and pleasured himself while cranking the engine.

Following his arrest in 2011, Haskins told investigators that he picked up the habit online.

Asked by The Saginaw News what drove him to commit these offenses, the 24-year-old Republican replied: 'I was in a messed-up state of mind mentally and emotionally when I did what I did. That's the only way I can even explain it.' 

Haskins also reportedly enjoyed gratifying himself sexually inside stolen cop cars, trucks and once in a mosquito control car.

But the fresh-faced political candidate who seeks to represent the 95th State District insisted that he has turned a new leaf and has gone past the dark phase in his life when he was 'young and stupid.'

‘I feel that, yes, I’ve made mistakes in my past. But I’m working to correct those things and to try at least to put in my small part and help others in my community and try to make things right,’ said Haskins.

On his Facebook page, Haskins described himself as a 'pro-life, pro-family and freedom loving American.'

Jordan Haskins' criminal history dates back to the time when he was arrested for a break-in at age 15 in North Carolina. He spent the next six years going in and out of correctional facilities for trespassing and larceny.

Looking back on his desolate youth, Haskins said he was a lonely, angry and bored kid in search of an adrenalin rush who belonged on the 'world's dumbest criminals' list.

After moving to Michigan in 2009, Haskins continued his petty-crime spree, which earned him a slew of misdemeanor charges for breaking into state vehicles, pulling out spark plug wires and masturbating to the sound of the running motor.

In 2010, Haskins was sent to jail for 55 days and one-year probation, but ran afoul of the law just a few months after his release for joyriding and masturbating in police cruises and a city-owned pickup trucks.

In September 2011, Haskins pleaded no contest to multiple counts of breaking and entering, unlawful driving and malicious destruction of property, and was sentenced to one year and eight months in prison.

In retrospect, the aspiring state house representative has blamed his transgressions on his troubled family situation, having being raised without a father by his mother and grandmother.

Haskins said doing time in prison was his ultimate wake-up call – and also a call to action.

‘I've realized that my gift that I have is in government and politics,’ he said. ‘I've found my niche, my passion.’

Haskins' parole will run out October 23 - just 11 days before Election Day. He hopes that voters will recognize that he has been working hard to correct his mistakes and give him a second chance by electing him into office.

The 24-year-old insisted that his life story is representative of real 'true red-blooded American conservatism' - not the watered down version where GOP candidates emerge as ‘whitewashed,' perfect people.

Haskins went on to describe his core values as his 'stool of conservatism' that stands on faith, family and freedom.

As someone intimately familiar with the criminal justice system, the 24-year-old said if elected, he plans to propose laws that would help former inmates find employment after release.

The Democrat who currently holds the 95th District House seat that Haskins is seeking is running for state Senate. Haskins, the sole Republican in the race, will face the Democrat who wins a primary in August.
