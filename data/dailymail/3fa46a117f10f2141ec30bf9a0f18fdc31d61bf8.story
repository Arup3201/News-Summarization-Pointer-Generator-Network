With its grand staircases, ornate plasterwork and period paneling you might be forgiven for thinking that these pictures were taken on set at Downton Abbey or a Royal palace.

But the beautiful Victorian property, which will come complete with its own spa, could be yours as it's listed for sale by a London estate agent.

Snapping up the two properties, on the market as sumptuous residential accommodation, will set you back a pretty penny however.

Fixer-uppers in Park Street, Mayfair, which have been put up for sale for £45 million

The two historic homes became two of the world's most expensive fixed-uppers after an estate agent put them on the market this week

The property, dating back to the 1890s, features impressive grand staircases

The Mayfair pads may be terraces but they are expected to fetch a staggering £45million by estate agents - a whopping £2,500 per square ft.

Built in the late 1890s, the grade II listed building is situated in a terrace of six buildings between Alford Street and Mount Street in the exclusive Mayfair district.

The exterior's red brick with stone dressings is in keeping with the polished look of the area, which is home to a variety of international embassies and company headquarters and known as a highly desirable place to live.

The buildings had been used for commercial purposes until now.

Much of the interior of the impressive building maintains its Victorian features

The buildings, complete with high ceilings and period fireplaces, has been used in recent years as commercial property, but will go on the market for use as two stunning apartments

Plans for converting the building into residential properties allow for ten bedrooms including staff accommodation

Both properties come with planning permission for eleven bedrooms between the two including space for staff quarters.

Each home has permission for its own 
spa, including a swimming pool, gym and steam room, a separate breakfast
room, its own library, drawing rooms, an ante room and even a cigar 
room.

One of the dwellings has a 700sq ft 
roof garden while the owner of the other home will be able to enjoy some
fresh air in a courtyard garden.

The master bedroom with its accompanying two bathrooms and twin dressing rooms take up an entire floor in each place.

It has been put on the market by Wetherell Estate Agents and Knight Frank and is available on a 125 year lease with the freehold assigned on completion of building works.
