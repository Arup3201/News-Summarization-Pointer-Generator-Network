QPR celebrated promotion to the Premier League in style following the club's 1-0 victory over Derby County in Saturday's Wembley play-off final.

Striker Bobby Zamora capitalised on a defensive error from Rams defender Richard Keogh in the final minute of normal time to give the Hoops a dramtic late win.

Harry Redknapp's side, who secured their return to the top-flight at the first time of asking, celebrated in the Wembley dressing room and posed for photos with the play-off final trophy.

Striker Charlie Austin, who joined the 
Hoops from fellow promotion winners Burnley at the start of the season, 
posted a photo of himself with the trophy to social networking site 
Twitter as the celebrations really began to get going.

Kevin
 Doyle, who stripped down to just his briefs, posed with Aaron Hughes 
and the pair celebrated with the trophy while Joey Barton was snapped 
with his arm around Shaun Wright-Phillips.

QPR
 clinched promotion to the promised land of the Premier League despite 
midfielder Gary O'Neil being sent off for hauling down Derby striker 
Johnny Russell with 30 minutes of the game to go.

However,
 QPR's ten men kept the game goalless right up until the last minute 
when Zamora popped up to send the Hoops fans into raptures.
