Jon Dolan is a Chelsea fan with a Matthew Harding Lower season ticket and he's has been a regular at Stamford Bridge for more than 40 years.

With his team about to make their first major signing of the summer in the form of former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, the Blues supporter explains why Chelsea fans won't be welcoming the 27-year-old to Stamford Bridge with open arms.   

Here we go again. Only 12 months after the relief of getting rid of Rafa Benitez, the faithful at Stamford Bridge are being asked to warm to his on-field equivalent… Cesc Fabregas.

Some hope. Try to think of a more unpopular current player for a Chelsea fan and you are struggling.

Controversy: Cesc Fabregas hasn't been a popular figure amongst Chelsea fans

Obviously there is Samir Nasri - you just have to look at him to be wound up - and Luis Suarez combines being objectionable with actually playing for Liverpool. But Uruguay’s finest is generally hopeless when he faces Chelsea.

No, Fabregas is the one. He has more previous than Benitez, who stoked the rivalry between Stamford Bridge and Anfield and will never be forgiven for his plastic flag taunts.

Even winning the Europa League as ‘interim’ manager when he replaced cult hero Roberto Di Matteo was not enough.

Rival: Jack Wilshere revealed Lampard and Fabregas didn't like each other on the pitch

Big shoes to fill: Fabregas has his work cut out if he is to emulate Lampard's historic career at Chelsea

It started in 2007 at the Millennium Stadium during the Carling Cup Final against Arsenal.

This was the one where John Terry took a kick in the face and ended up in hospital but precious little Cesc was more interested in complaining to the referee about some harmless celery throwing when he was taking a corner.

Then, as Frank Lampard attempted to calm down a brawl which led to three sendings off, the chippy Spaniard grabbed hold of him around the neck, starting a long-running feud.

Lampard is a proper legend, rightly revered throughout the game, but pictures of him facing Fabregas in games against Arsenal and Barcelona show the two squaring up.

In 2012, before the Chelsea vs Barcelona Champions League semi-final Jack Wilshere gave an insight into his former team-mate on twitter. ‘I think Cesc would love to score tonight ... him and Lampard never liked each other on the pitch,’ tweeted Jack.

Well Fabregas didn’t get a goal or a win… and Frank was able to lead Chelsea to the trophy in Munich a couple of weeks later.

Upset: Chelsea fans were forced to welcome former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez to their club in 2012

Get him out: The Blues fans were less than impressed with the temporary appointment

Fabregas must have something against Chelsea heroes because he was at it with Jose Mourinho in the season just ended.

Jose made a perfectly reasonable remark about Barcelona not being up to much this season and was told to shut up and mind his own business by the soon-to-be-former Nou Camp star.

Still, it seems Jose is too big to hold grudges and Fabregas is on his way to the centre of Chelsea’s midfield.

Of course, there is a significant hole to fill there… but for the sake of our sanity don’t even think of giving Super Frank’s No 8 shirt to Cesc the Pest.

Gone, but not forgotten: Lampard revealed he will leave Chelsea when his contract is up on July 1

Nearly done: Jose Mourinho looks set to wrap up the signing of Fabregas before the World Cup
