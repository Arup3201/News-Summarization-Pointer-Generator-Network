A grandmother who had been left disabled by a stroke died after she choked on her dinner which care home staff should have cut up for her.

Partially sighted Mavis Clarkson, 78, who was unable to cut up her own food, died two days after she choked on roast lamb at Longton Nursing and Residential Home near Preston, Lancashire.

Yesterday a coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death, but said that neglect was a factor in Mrs Clarkson's death, and criticised care home staff's 'gross failure' in preventing it.

After the inquest, the mother of three's family condemned staff at the 58-bed, local authority-run home for failing to help the retired machinist.

The inquest heard that staff knew Mrs Clarkson's food needed to be cut up because a stroke had affected her left side, but had failed to do so.

Coroner Simon Jones blasted failings by the staff at Longton, saying they contributed to Mrs Clarkson's death in July last year and vowing to write a report about procedures at the home. 

He added: 'I'm satisfied the risks posed by the lack of a structured meal plan amount to a gross failure.'

Speaking outside the inquest, Mrs Clarkson's husband of 58 years, Trevor, and their children David, Susan and Amanda said they saw the coroner's verdict as justice for their mother.

And they said the verdict was significant not only for their family, but for relatives of other care home residents.

Mr Clarkson said: 'The saddest thing is she was coming home to us - she was in the home and we made necessary preparations and did work to bring her home.'

His daughter, Susan, added: 'For the last 15 months we have worked to get this verdict.  Justice has been done, not just for her, but for other people in nursing homes.

'The week before she died we had taken her for a drink at the pub with her grandchildren. It's a lovely precious memory.'

They described Mrs Clarkson, who enjoyed going on safaris and cruises, as adventurous and 'a brilliant mum.'

The care home has not responded to MailOnline's request for a comment.
