Authorities in Florida on Wednesday arrested a 'fetish model' for her role in a collection of pornographic videos that police say show the gruesome killings of several barnyard animals, including the decapitation of chickens.

Stephanie Hird, 29, is the second 'model' arrested on animal cruelty charges for her role in the videos, in which she is seen allegedly killing and torturing animals as a form of animal-torture fetish porn.

Miami police arrested Hird as she attempted to board a plane at Miami International Airport. Her arrest comes less than two weeks after 28-year-old Sara Zamora was arrested on similar charges.

Fetish: Stephanie Hird was one of two women arrested for allegedly torturing and killing animals in animal-torture fetish porn films

'Giantess': Hird was featured on TLC in a 'giantess fetish' film where she pretended to be 1,000 feet tall to fulfill a fan's fantasy

Zamora has been hit with eight felony counts of animal cruelty for allegedly decapitating chickens and beating rabbits, amongst other forms of alleged torture.

Authorities say that Zamora and Hird were hired to star in the videos by Adam Redford, a fishing boat captain who authorities believe was producing animal 'crush' videos, which are pornographic movies that show female actresses killing and torturing animals while engaging in sex acts. 

Authorities first caught wind of the videos when People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals directed investigators to a website called 'SOS Barn,' according to the Miami Herald.

Redford has been listed as a co-defendant in the case but is yet to be taken into custody.

'Torture': In one scene, Sara Zamora was seen groping a man's genitals with one hand and cutting off a chicken's head with the other

'Producer': Adam Redford also has been charged but is yet to be taken into custody. Authorities say he was the 'producer' of the films

According to the Herald, Redford just completed probation after he was convicted of similar animal cruelty charges.

Redford was arrested last year for a video filmed on his property that showed two rabbits shot with an air rifle at point blank range by a woman as part of a 'crush' video.

After the animals are shot, they squealed and squirmed around before dying from their injuries.

According to the Naples Daily News, Hird was named as the woman who appeared in the video. However, she was never charged with a crime in the case.

According to the Herald, the recent video shows Zamora groping a man's genitals with her left hand while 'repeatedly cutting a chicken’s neck using hedge clippers with her right..'

In other videos, Zamora posed in 'sexy outfits' after chopping the head off of a screaming bird. She is also seen in the videos beating chickens to death with a wooden spoon and karate chopping the necks of several rabbits, authorities say.

Giant: Hird was hired to play a 'giant' in a video featured on TLC's Strange Sex series

Hird also advertises her sexual services on social media websites.

'Are you in touch with your darkest fantasies? Have you created a life 
for yourself where you can experience them,' she wrote on her public 
Facebook page in February. 'I have. I am f***ing crazy.'

Hird even posted a photo of her and Zamora on Instagram with the hashtag '#PartnersInCrime. 

Hird's other fetish work includes starring in a video with a man who likes being manhandled by women - 'giant' women, specifically, which seems to be inspired by the cult classic 'Attack of the 50-Foot Woman.'

In the video - which was featured on the TLC show Strange Sex - Hird acts like she's a giant while her male co-star rolls around on the ground pretending that he is being crushed by her giant feet.
