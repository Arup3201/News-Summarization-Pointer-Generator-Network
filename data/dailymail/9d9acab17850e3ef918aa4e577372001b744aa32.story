The old maxim goes that if men rather than women had to have babies, the human race would have died out long ago.

Now those birthing pains are being felt by men in China.

On Mother's Day on Sunday, male volunteers in Nanchang City, in south China's Jiangxi province, were hooked up to complex machines that provided them with a painful taste of what women go through in labour.

Some 20 men went on a local TV show to submit to the pains that women endure.

The challenge consisted of ten levels of pain with an agony scale from 50 to 500.

Electric shocks were sent into the abdomen of the male volunteers - including British singer Iain Inglis, 31, who lives and works in China - who gave up when the pain-o-metre hit 100.

'It was too much for me,' he said. 'The pain was terrible!'

Another man, Lee Hao, said: 'This was incredible. I couldn't stand much of it all. I understand now why my wife screamed for drugs when she was giving birth.'

Zhou Nan successfully stuck to the end and hit the 500 mark.

'I am the father of triplets and wanted to understand the great pain my wife experienced when she was giving birth,' he said.

'It was horrible. I have nothing but deep admiration for all mothers after this ordeal.'

The simulated pain in the show lasted for a maximum of 30 seconds but women often have to endure it for hours or even days.

'This can help people realise how great mothers are,' said the event organiser.
