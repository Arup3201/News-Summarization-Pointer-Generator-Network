Bill Cross, 79, was knocked down and killed by Paul Bithell in a Stoke-on-Trent pub car park

A widow hugged the careless driver who  killed her husband yesterday in court after convincing the judge to give him softer sentence.

Bill Cross, 79 - the grandfather of Port Vale striker Tom Pope - died 17 days after he was knocked down by a reversing motorist in a Stoke-on-Trent pub car park last November.

Married father-of-two Paul Bithell, 30, was ordered to carry out 120 hours unpaid work after admitting causing death by careless driving.

He claimed he had not been able to see the pensioner in the dark when he knocked him down in the Sneyd Arms pub in Sneyd Green.

Mr Cross's widow Doreen, 80, wrote a letter to the judge insisting it was a genuine accident, that that the torment at accidentally killing her husband was punishment enough.

She said: said: 'It was a genuine accident. I asked the judge to be lenient because I didn't think the lad needed any more punishment.

'I hope he can move on now because I know he's been finding it very hard. As a family, we're just glad it's over.

'My family is left without a dad and grandad but it was a genuine accident.

'It was dark and hard to see. It's been very drawn out but fortunately I have a big family who have been with me all the time.'

Bithell faced jail on Wednesday at Stroke-On-Trent Crown Court - after it was revealed he had a previous conviction for drink-driving.

He told police: 'I glanced in my mirrors, I saw nothing.

'I looked out and just heard a thud. I opened the door and looked out and just saw a figure lying there. When I realised it was a man I ran to him.'

He had half a pint of beer before leaving with a friend in the passenger seat and his child in the back, but was found to be below the legal limit.

Paul Cliff, mitigating, said Bithell recognises the grief that would have been caused by the accident.

Mr Cliff said: 'He wants me to apologise publicly to the court and to the family of Mr Cross. He is genuinely sorry and he accepts the devastation that would have been caused. 

'He has struggled to come to terms with the guilt. It is an example of the need for extreme caution when reversing on a public car park, particularly on a damp, dark evening in November.

'Mr Cross was not visible at the beginning of the manoeuvre. As he reversed Mr Cross must have been in the blind spot.

'It was a momentary lapse of concentration. Following the impact he immediately stopped. Although distraught, he acted appropriately.'

Bithell claimed he had not been able to see the pensioner in the dark when he knocked him down in the Sneyd Arms pub, Sneyd Green, Stoke-on-Trent

Judge David Fletcher sentenced Bithell to a 12-month community order with 120 hours unpaid work.

He told Bithell: 'This is a tragic case. The effect on you has also been devastating because you, for the rest of your life, have to live with the knowledge you are responsible for the death of another human being.' 

Bithell was also given  a one-year driving ban and ordered to pay £125 costs.
