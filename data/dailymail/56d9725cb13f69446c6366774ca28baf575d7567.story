A Left-wing cookery writer has sparked outrage by saying David Cameron should resign for using his ‘dead son’ as a front to privatise the NHS.

Jack Monroe, who writes for The Guardian on cookery and poverty issues, said on Twitter that the Prime Minister should go because he ‘uses stories about his dead son as misty-eyed rhetoric to legitimise selling our NHS to his friends’.

Mr Cameron’s son Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, died aged six in 2009.

Last night, Tory backbenchers lined up to express their disgust at the ‘distasteful’ and ‘sick’ comments, and the idea that the Prime Minister would use his son for such a purpose. 

Mr Cameron has previously spoken about his admiration for the NHS and how it helped care for his son.

At the last Tory conference, he questioned how Labour could ‘dare’ to claim he does not care about the Health Service when it had been so important for his family.

Miss Monroe made her comments on the social networking website, where users were coming up with their own suggestions of why ‘#CameronMustGo’.

Her suggestion was: ‘Because he uses stories about his dead son as misty-eyed rhetoric to legitimise selling our NHS to his friends’.

She started publishing recipes online aimed at people with low incomes, and last year began contributing recipes and columns to The Guardian.

Miss Monroe also appeared in a Labour Party broadcast as a member of the public.

Mr Cameron has been accused by the Left of promoting the privatisation of the Health Service as part of wholesale reforms which came into effect two years ago.

Reaction: Andrew Rosindell (left), Tory MP for Romford, said the comments were 'deeply shocking', while Philip Davies (right), Tory MP for Shipley, said it shows 'how deeply unpleasant people on the Left are'

Ultimatum: Sarah Wollaston (pictured), Tory chairman of the Commons health select committee, said the blogger should 'immediately apologise… or The Guardian should decide if she should go'

Jack Monroe, 26, is a mother-of-one and food writer from Southend-on-Sea in Essex.

She attended Westcliff High School For Girls but left aged 16 and worked odd jobs before becoming a control room employee for Essex County Fire and Rescue Service in 2007.

Five years later, having left that job too after becoming unable to balance night shifts with looking after a young son as a single mother, she started a blog called A Girl Called Jack.

The blog on budget food and recipes became a huge success and Miss Monroe now writes a weekly Guardian column - also contributing to other newspapers and broadcasters.

She had planned to marry a long-term police officer girlfriend earlier this year, but their relationship ended last October.

Now, Miss Monroe lives in west London with her new partner, mother-of-one Allegra McEvedy, a chef who was 44 yesterday.

But critics pointed out that it was under Labour that private companies were invited in to run NHS services.

Tory backbenchers expressed outrage at Miss Monroe’s comments.

Nadine Dorries said: 'I respect Ms Monroe for many of her principles, but this is shocking. She is a parent, she only needs to imagine the unimaginable to know how hurtful and wrong that comment must be.'

Charlotte Leslie added: 'Anyone of any integrity is left pretty speechless. Not only is this incredibly callous and hurtful from someone who is supposed to be in a position of some responsibility, it is also utterly inaccurate. 

'It just goes to show what depths anyone must stoop to in order to find a criticism of a PM who has overseen a massive turnaround of this country from a Lefty Government that, in true Labour style, left us bankrupt.' 

Andrew Percy, a Tory member of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘This is not just a distasteful tweet, it is sick.

‘If a Right-Wing politician or columnist had made such a comment, Miss Monroe would be writing hand-wringing columns about how evil or cruel such a comment was. 

'If The Guardian had any moral compass it would sack Miss Monroe and publish a front-page apology to the Prime Minister and his wife for the distress this comment has made.’

Andrew Rosindell, Tory MP for Romford, said: ‘This is thoroughly unpleasant and distasteful. David and Samantha’s tragic loss of their son has never been used to justify any Government policy.

‘These comments are deeply shocking and will cause enormous hurt. They should be withdrawn immediately.’

Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘Left-wingers like this are always the first to take offence in what others say, but think it is fine to make the vilest comments themselves.

‘This just goes to show how deeply unpleasant people on the Left are – something many of us see day in day out, but others tend not to see. They preach compassion one minute but are more lacking in compassion than anyone.’

Sarah Wollaston, Tory chairman of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘What would The Guardian say about an MP who made such a disgusting and heartless comment? 

'Would they call for them to be sacked? She should immediately apologise… or The Guardian should decide if she should go.’
