A wearable sensor made of gold wires has been created by Australian scientists and could help develop an electronic skin capable of monitoring a person's blood pressure, pulse and heartbeat.

The highly sensitive wire used for the pressure sensor is as thin as human skin and could also potentially be used to design cheap phone or tablet touch screens that are prone to cracking.

Monash University's Dr Wenlong Cheng said the sensor had great potential for monitoring people's health anytime and anywhere.

'The sensors are flexible, yet robust and our testing showed they could be used for checking such things as blood pressure, blood pulse and heartbeat. These results have particular implications for future "at-home" diagnostic tools for elderly or disabled people,' Dr Cheng said.

The researchers from the university and the Melbourne Centre for Nanofabrication used the thinnest gold wire produced to design the sensor, which is about two nanometres thick – a nanometre is one billionth of a metre.

'We chose the ultrathin gold nanowires because they are mechanically flexible and have good conductivity, yet are very robust which makes them highly suitable for wearable devices,' Dr Cheng said.

The sensor's robust flexibility means it could be worn as a diagnostic device to detect blood pressure or pulse in real time and under various conditions, including during exercise or sleep.

Dr Cheng said while the team had only produced a patch-size sensor at this stage, the fabrication process could easily be replicated on a much larger scale.

The research was published in Nature Communications.
