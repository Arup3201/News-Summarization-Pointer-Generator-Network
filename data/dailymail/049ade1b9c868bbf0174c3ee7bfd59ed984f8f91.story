Islamic State militants have shot and wounded a senior Syrian rebel commander inside Turkey, it has been claimed, raising yet more questions of Ankara's commitment to defeating the terror group.

Abu Issa, the leader of a group fighting ISIS in the besieged city of Kobane, and his 20-year-old son Ammar, were ambushed by jihadists in the southeastern Turkish town of Urfa on Friday afternoon.

The pair - who had been attending a meeting with Turkish officials - were snatched from their car in an apparent kidnapping attempt, after the driver of their car allegedly simply switched off the engine when confronted by four heavily armed ISIS militants at a roadblock. 

After being seized they were driven at high speed towards the Syrian border and only managed to escape when one of the third-party smugglers ISIS uses to transport people and weapons into Syria bailed on the plan after spotting Turkish soldiers.

Militant: The attempted kidnapping raises serious questions about Turkey's commitment to joining the international effort to destroy the Islamic State terror group in Syria and Iraq

None of the Islamic State attackers wore masks and two of them were known to Abu Issa from fighting in Kobane, his aides in the Thuwar Raqqa rebel group told the Telegraph.

Using an alternative acronym for the terror group, spokesman Ahmed Abdul Khader said: 'Isil cars blocked the road ahead of them, and four armed men grabbed them from the vehicle. It was 6.30pm.'

A matching account of the kidnapping was reportedly given to the newspaper by another military commander in the group, Abo Ayham.

He claimed that Abu Issa's driver - who was also his most trusted advisor - had been in on the plot, driving the rebel leader into a quiet back road where the extremist were waiting, refusing to turn the vehicle around when ordered to do so, and turning off the car's engine rather than trying to escape.

Location: The southeastern Turkish town of Urfa - where Abu Issa was kidnapped - is approximately 50 miles from the Syrian border. His kidnapping was only aborted when a third-party smuggler helping the militants bailed on the plan when he saw Turkish soldiers close to the Syrian border crossing near Kobane

Kurdish forces defending a besieged Syrian town against ISIS fighters received supplies and weapons in an airdrop Sunday, US military officials said.

The airdrops into Kobane, on the border of Turkey, were the first conducted by the US in Syria and followed a series of American and coalition airstrikes supporting the Kurds.

The US stated earlier Sunday that it had launched 11 airstrikes overnight in the area of Kobane.

In a statement Sunday night, US Central Command said  C-130 cargo planes made multiple drops of arms and medical supplies that had been provided by Kurdish authorities in Iraq. 

The airdrops were intended to support continued resistance to ISIS as the Islamist extremist group attempts to gain control of Kobane. 

The news raises yet more questions about Turkey's commitment to the international fight against ISIS, after Ankara drew a great deal of international criticism for refusing to intervene to help Kurdish fighters battling militants just 200 yards over the border in Kobane.

There are also serious questions over why Turkey has allowed thousands of Western jihadists - who enter the country on budget airlines in tourist resorts - to easily pass over the border into Syria to join ISIS fighters there.

Turkey has long argued that ISIS does not have a presence in the country. 

Others claim small cells are able to operate in southern Turkish towns, easily popping over the border to fight in Syria before returning home to Turkey.

There are even claims from those on the ground that wounded ISIS militants are routinely smuggled from the frontline to receive treatment in Turkish hospitals, which are better equipped and less-stretched than those in northern Syria.

Turkey has also been accused of allowing up to 3,000 detained Western jihadists to rejoin the Islamic State in Syria in return for the release 49 diplomats who had been held prisoner by the terrorists.

Experts believe Turkey's reluctance to fully commit to the fight against ISIS is two-fold.

Firstly the brave Kurdish fighters battling ISIS in northern Syria have links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party - a group long-banned in Turkey amid accusations of terrorism.

Secondly, due to Turkey sharing borders with both Syria and Iraq, Ankara is understood to be worried that any move against ISIS could trigger a wave a car and suicide bombings there - something that would be devastating for the country's hugely important tourism industry.

This morning the main Syrian Kurdish armed group defending Kobane against an ISIS offensive said it hopes for more support after the U.S. air-dropped arms to its fighters for the first time. 

The U.S. military said on Sunday C-130 aircraft had delivered small arms, ammunition and medical supplies provided by the Kurdish authorities in Iraq.

'It will have a positive impact on the course of military operations and certainly we are still hoping for more support,' Redur Xelil told Reuters via Skype. 

An American journalist has been killed in a car crash in Turkey just days after claiming she claimed the Turkish intelligence services had threatened her over her reporting of the siege of Kobane.

Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'. 

Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the Syrian border in the back of aid vehicles.

Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'

Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network. 

In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place. 

Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally.

Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene.  

Death: Serena Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying

Only last Friday Shim was interviewed on camera by Press TV about her fears of being arrested by Turkish intelligence agencies.

In the short interview she alleged that she had been approached and accused of spying after a report in which he said she claimed to have received images of Islamic State terrorists being smuggled over the Turkey-Syria in vehicles belonging to the World Food Organization and other aid groups.

Shim described herself as 'surprised' at the accusation, 'because I have nothing to hide and I have never done anything aside my job.'
