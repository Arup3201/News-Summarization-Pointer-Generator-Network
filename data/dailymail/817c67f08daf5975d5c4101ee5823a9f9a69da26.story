Everybody loves a burger but it would seem that some love them more than most.

Two such super-fans are French graphic designers, Quentin and Thomas - the duo behind entertainingly silly website, fatandfuriousburger.com.

From a silver James Bond burger to a caviar encrusted papal feast, there seems to be very little that the pair can't reinterpret as fast food.

The name's Bun, James Bun: The silver Bond burger contains quail's eggs and fruits de mer

Is this the tastiest Beckham of all? The Becks burger includes Speck ham and Victorienne tomatoes

Inspiration: Along with David Beckham and James Bond, the new Pope also has his own meaty feast

Even David Beckham gets a look in, with a special Beckham burger that contains a variety of punning ingredients such as 'Speck-ham' and a 'Victorienne de tomates'.

That, for those who aren't French, translates as Speck, a juniper-flavoured ham from Austria's Tyrol region, and finely sliced tomatoes.

Others on the receiving end of the Fat and Furious treatment include Pope Francis, whose burger contains caramelised onions, lettuce and lashings of red and black caviar, and the last queen of France, Marie Antoinette, whose fast food tribute is made from 'crevettes décapitées' or headless prawns and chopped alfalfa.

For the silver-leaf covered James Bond, there's a suitably sophisticated blend of quails eggs, Blackcurrants, crème fraiche, salad, octopus, unpeeled garlic and fresh fish.

Thank the Lord! Just over a week into his new job, Pope Francis already has his very own burger

Fit for a queen: But perhaps the Queen shouldn't think too much about the fate of the queen that inspired this feast - Queen Marie Antoniette was beheaded on 16th October 1793 at the height of the French Revolution

One burger to feed them all... But would Frodo really have gone to Mordor for this bizarre creation?

Among the more bizarre burgers on the site are the Troy burger, which like the legendary Trojan horse has a surprise in the centre, and the 'Fart and Furious' burger, which is crammed with red Kidney beans.

Most strange of all is the Halloween burger, which say the pair, hopefully tongue-in-cheek, is a mixture of raw human flesh, beef heart, garlic, corn teeth marinated in holy water, Transylvanian capers, damned pickles and satanic Tabasco.

Buns away! The Fart and Furious burger could have a noisome effect on your kitchen
