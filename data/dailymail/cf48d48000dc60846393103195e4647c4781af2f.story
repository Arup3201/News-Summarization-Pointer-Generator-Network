Donna and Troy Harvey watched in horror last months as four cows they had 'raised since they were poddy calves' were killed by a lightning bolt during a severe thunderstorm.

The cows were taking shelter under a large tree as the property - in Milbong in southern Queensland - was lashed with wild winds and severe rainfall during the storm.

When an enourmous bolt of lightning hit the tree Sulky, Freiser, Arthie and Blackie were killed instantly, despite the tree remaining intact.

A farming family in southern Queensland lost four of their beef cattle  when they were struck by lightning last month while taking shelter under a tree during a thunderstorm

The severe storm whipped Donna Harvey's property in December, killing all the animals instantly including Sulky (pictured)

In a short video posted to the Higgins Storm Chasing Facebook page the woman's property can be seen being lashed with wild weather as the camera pans across her backyard.

Focusing on four of her cows taking shelter under a tree, Mrs Harvey holds the shot on her cattle before a huge lightning bolt splits the sky in half illuminating the dark stormy surrounds.

The 36-year-old can be screaming out in horror at the realisation she had just lost four cows she and husband Tony had care for since they were very young.

Freiser, Arthie and Blackie were also killed instantly by the devastating lightning strike

'It was heart breaking, the moment I saw them all hit the ground... I knew they were dead,' Donna told Daily Mail Australia.

'I balled my eyes out... (It's) very hard when you have put in all the hard work, feeding them twice a day rain hail or shine,' she continued.

'Especially when you have raised them up from babies.' 

Despite the severe bolt that killed the four cows - Sulky, Freiser, Arthie and Blackie - the tree 'is fine' and still standing weeks after the storm.

Donna said she and husband Tony fed and cared for the cows 'rain hail or shine'

The storm was so severe it plunged the Milbong property into near total darkness at 1pm in the afternoon

A new addition in the form of a little cow named Boofa has helped the family with the grieving process

The farming family had raised the cattle for almost two years, making it through one of the driest and most difficult spring seasons Donna had seen in 13 years on the property.

'You have to be careful what you wish for, Because I was just saying to my husband days earlier that I wanted to capture a photo of a lightning strike. I certainly did,' she said.

The four beef cows are sorely missed in the Harvey household, but a new addition in the form of a little cow named Boofa has helped them with the grieving process. 

Mrs Harvey said they bought it for their son Ryan to help 'mend a broken heart' and he is smitten with his new friend.
