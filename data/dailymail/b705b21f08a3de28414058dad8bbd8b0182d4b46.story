Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said his government had taken the 'most sensible action' in abandoning plans to restrict women's rights to have an abortion

Spain's government today abandoned plans to restrict women's right to abortion, which had sparked mass protests and international condemnation.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said his government would drop the most contentious parts of the proposed reform, which would have ended women's right to freely opt for abortion up to 14 weeks into a pregnancy.

He said: 'We will continue studying ways to obtain greater acceptance of the reform, but I think I have taken the most sensible decision at this time.

Mr Rajoy added: 'We cannot have a law that will be changed in a minute as soon as another government comes along.'

He said his government would push on with a family-planning reform, but it would focus on only two areas: requiring girls aged under 18 to get their parents' consent to have an abortion and other 'family support' measures.

The most controversial elements proposed by Justice Minister Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, which sparked street demonstrations by both opponents and supporters, will be dropped.

A draft bill approved in December aimed to allow abortion only in cases of rape reported to the police or a medically certified threat to the mother's physical or psychological health. Under the bill women wouldn't be able to abort a pregnancy on the grounds of foetal abnormality.

The previous Socialist government brought Spain into line with much of Europe when it passed the current law in 2010.

Existing regulation allows women to choose to terminate a pregnancy in the first 14 weeks, extended up to 22 weeks if the foetus is seriously deformed or if the birth poses a serious risk to the mother.

International human rights group Amnesty International said Mr Ruiz-Gallardon's planned reform would have endangered the lives of women and girls by driving them into backstreet abortions.

France's Social Affairs Minister Marisol Touraine in January said it would 'take women back to the Stone Age'.

Mr Ruiz-Gallardon said lawmakers had to balance the mother's rights with the unborn child's, but he failed to gain enough support to bring his bill to parliament.

One high-profile dissenting figure in the ruling Popular Party was Extremadura region president Jose Antonio Monago.

He led a bill in the regional parliament calling for a reform that is 'more consensual and in tune with today's society and in line with the countries around us'.

After promising in its 2011 election campaign to 'reinforce protection of the right to life', Mr Rajoy's government repeatedly postponed the reform as it struggled with internal dissent and pressure from the Roman Catholic Church.

In April 2013, the then head of Spain's Catholic Church, Cardinal Antonio Maria Rouco Varela, called for an 'urgent reform' of the 2010 law.

Critics said Mr Rajoy made the decision with one eye on next year's local and regional elections.

A leading anti-abortion group, Right to Life, branded Mr Ruiz-Gallardon a 'coward' for not standing up to political opponents and urged Spaniards not to vote for Mr Rajoy.

The group's spokeswoman, Gador Joya said: 'He has shown that he is capable of betraying his base, the 11 million voters who trusted in him.'

But abortion rights campaign group Decidir welcomed the news, with spokeswoman Isabel Serrano saying: 'We are back to a place we should never have left: the European standard, where a woman's decision is respected and abortions are carried out in conditions of safety and equality for all.'
