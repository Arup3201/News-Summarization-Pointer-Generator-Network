The president of France is to try to turn around his abysmal approval ratings by hiring an expert in gangsta rap music to write his speeches.

Francois Hollande has appointed Pierre-Yves Bocquet to help him spice up his speeches, which are widely considered to be boring.

A graduate of France's top school for civil servants, Mr Bocquet is well qualified for the role. But it has emerged that he also leads a secret life as a rap music critic under the pseudonym Pierre Evil.

Rapper's delight: French president Francois 
Hollande has hired a gangsta rap journalist (and senior government 
technocrat) as his new speech writer. Right, Pierre Evil's 2005 book Gangsta-Rap

Formerly a social security project 
manager in Mr Hollande's administration, Mr Bocquet is known among 
colleagues as a 'meticulous and methodical' technocrat.

But
 his fondness for thick, shiny rings nonetheless confused colleagues at 
the Elysée who knew nothing of his doubl life as a hip hop music critic.

The
 mystery was resolved with the disclosure that he was the author of a 
2005 book called Gangsta Rap and a specialist reviewer for Chronic'art, a
 cultural online magazine.

Even
 his editors at Chronic'art did not realise his true identity and his 
double life has led to comparisons with the counter-cultural street 
artist Banksy.

Mr Bocquet, 
40, studied at Strasbourg's École Nationale d'Administration, an elite 
college that trains France's top civil servants, with alumni including 
past presidents Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac - as well as
 Mr Hollande himself.

He has
 been working with the French government since the Nineties, while at 
the same time developing a cultural theory of rap music as a political 
weapon against America's black underclass

French music journalist Fred Hanak said he regards Pierre Evil as one of the top three rap music reviewers in the country.

But, says Mr Hanak, although Evil is an authority on such figures as Public Enemy and Snoop Dogg, he is totally uninterested in France's own vibrant hip hop music scence.

'He is a little like the Jacques Chirac of rap critics: old school, excellent in foreign politics but terrible in internal affairs,' the journalist told Le Monde.

Mr Bocquet's promotion comes as Hollande shakes up his PR team in an effort to raise his abysmal popularity ratings amid record unemployment and a stagnating economy.

He was appointed the president's chief speechwriter after Paul Bernard resigned citing 'personal reasons'.

Mr Bocquet would not commment on his journalist alter-ego, except to say that his new work 'puts in parentheses his writing activities in private.'

He added: 'The only person who writes speeches for François Hollande is François Hollande, my role is just to help him prepare.'
