Lifelike: One of French artist Laurence Ruet's scarily realistic dolls

With her sparkling blue eyes, long red locks and pretty bow she looks just like a normal little girl.

It's hard to believe that she won't start running around causing mischief or playing with the toy that she clutches.

But the little red-head is actually a scarily realistic doll created by French artist Laurence Ruet.

The doll is one of a collection of intricately crafted unique creations which normally fetch between 450 and 1,350 Euros each.

Hardly a crying, walking living doll and a far cry from the Cabbage Patch Kid dolls of old, the creations are not advertised as toys but as collectors items.

Each child takes Laurence around two weeks to craft and cannot be replicated - they are not made using a mould.

Made from a malleable polymer resin, the dolls are cooked rather like ceramics with limbs and faces fashioned from acrylic.

Laurence painstakingly shapes each child's facial expression - the hardest part to make she says - and seems to have a penchant for freckles.

The eyes are made of glass and the hair either from mohair or real hair.

As well as the dolls themselves, she also pays great attention to crafting unique cloths and shoes - with each child dressed in classical clothing.

Collectable: The dolls more often than not carry their own toy, but the creation on the left is a rare example of one without a doll of its own

She said: 'My aim is to give emotion. I am very sensitive to expressions like delicacy, timidity, surprise and tenderness.'

The dolls range from newborn to nursery school age with 'mini-bebes' starting at eight inches long and the biggest creations standing at an almost lifelike 22 inches tall.

Laurence of Dijon in France, who only makes a handful of the dolls each year, was a portrait painter until she discovered her love for creating the lifelike children 12 years ago.

She now says that it is her favourite art medium.
