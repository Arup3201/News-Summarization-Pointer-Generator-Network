Afghan army mortar rounds killed at least 20 civilians and wounded another 41 including women and children at a wedding in Afghanistan's southern Helmand province, officials said today.

General Mahmoud, deputy Commander of the Afghan military in the province, said artillery was fired from three directions at a village in Sangin district where the wedding was held last night.

The rounds were fired during fierce fighting between army units and Taliban militia, though it is not clear whether the wedding was deliberately targeted.

Army chiefs say they are investigating after mortar rounds fired from three different locations during fighting with Taliban forces landed on a wedding party, killing at least 20 and wounding 41

Among the injured were women and children as a relative of the bride said his house had been hit and nine of his children were missing

General Mahmoud said: 'What we know so far is that our soldiers fired mortar rounds from three outposts but we do not know whether it was intentional.

'We have launched our investigation and will punish those who did this.'

One of the bride's relatives told ABC Australia that an explosive shell hit his house, and that nine of his children were missing.

Gul Pasha Bakhtiar, deputy provincial police chief, said 26 civilians, including women and children, were killed and 41 wounded by mortar shells fired from the army side.

At least 3,188 Afghan civilians were killed in fighting with Taliban insurgents in 2014, making it the deadliest year on record for non-combatants, the United Nations said in a report last week.

The numbers are embarrassing for U.S. and NATO commanders as they end their combat role in the country after 13 years, declaring mission complete and handing control of security back to the Afghan forces.

The wounded were taken to nearby Lashkar Gah hospital to be treated (pictured). The UN reported that 3,188 civilians died in fighting last year, making it the deadliest year on record for non-combatants 

Maluk Khan, the brother of the bride, said there were hundreds of guests, including many women and children, when the mortar shells started landing.

'In minutes, our happy moments turned into a bloodbath,' Khan told Reuters from a hospital in Lashkar Gah where he and other relatives brought the wounded.

For the first time, ground battles between the Taliban and Afghan forces became the main cause of civilian deaths in 2014. In previous years, IEDs, or roadside bombs, killed the most.

Civilian deaths over the year to the end of November were up 19 percent over the same period last year and had already surpassed the previous high set in 2011, when 3,133 civilians were killed.

Sangin witnessed one of the deadliest battles between Afghan security forces and Taliban last year.

The deaths happened in a village in Sangin, a part of Afghanistan's fraught souther province of Helmand
