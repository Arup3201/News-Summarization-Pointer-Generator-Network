After catching Sportsmail's eye during the World Cup, reporter Vanessa Huppenkothen was in Germany to interview compatriot Guillermo Ochoa.

The Mexican journalist posed for pictures in a Schalke 04 shirt, and also interviewed her country's first choice goalkeeper.

She made the trip to Germany especially to interview the keeper before his debut. Huppenkothen's father was a Mexican and German footballer, and even though she was born in Mexico City she has always been an avid fan of the Bundesliga.

Ochoa was one of the stand-out performers for Mexico at the World Cup, and was particularly impressive in his side's 0-0 draw with Brazil.

Compatriots: Huppenkothen interviews Guillermo Ochoa before West Ham take on MalagaÂ 

Sam Allardyce's men will meet Malaga after beating German side Schalke on penalties after a 0-0 draw yesterday.

The Hammers have endured a difficult pre-season - apart from yesterday's result, they have either lost or drawn every match they have played.

Malaga, on the other hand, have only failed to win one of their four pre-season games. They beat Alan Pardew's Newcastle 3-1 in Germany yesterday.
