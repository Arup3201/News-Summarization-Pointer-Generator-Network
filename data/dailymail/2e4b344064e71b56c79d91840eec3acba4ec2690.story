West Ham defender Winston Reid admitted he was relieved West Ham had avoided being another of the weekend's FA Cup victims as they edged past League One high-flyers Bristol City on Sunday.

With both Chelsea and Manchester City crashing out of the competition at the hands of Bradford City and Middlesbrough respectively a day earlier, pressure was on the in-form Hammers to ensure they put on a professional display at Ashton Gate.

Diafra Sakho's header nine minutes from time was enough to send the Hammers through to the fifth round at the expense of Steve Cotterill's side - who were in complete control during the first half but failed to make their dominance count.

After the game Reid told the BBC: 'In the first half we were under pressure from Bristol City. 

'It's always difficult to come to these places though so it was important we got a clean sheet and the win.

'The manager mentioned to us before the game about that (the cup shocks on Saturday).

'With that in mind we didn't want to be another of them, so we just wanted to get the job done.

'Of course we have a chance (of winning the FA Cup) but there's a long way to go yet. 

'Today we played okay but ultimately got the result we needed.'
