The so-called King of Instagram, Dan Bilzerian, is no longer being investigated for allegations he kicked a model in the face at a South Beach nightclub last December.

Miami police recently told People that the millionaire poker player is no longer being investigated for Vanessa Castano's claims he kicked her in the head with his military-style boot.

Bilzerian has also recently sewed up some legal issues he'd faced for allegedly detonated a home-made bomb at an unofficial firing range outside Las Vegas .

Cleared: The so-called King of Instagram, Dan Bilzerian, is no longer being investigated for claims he kicked a model in the face in December 

Civil suit: Miami-based model Vanessa Castano alleges the internet playboy intentionally kicked her in the face at a South Beach club while wearing military-style boots. Her civil suit is still pending

Still pending is Castano's civil suit against the playboy, which reads, in part: 

'Bilzerian was on an elevated dancing platform...and violently and intentionally kicked plaintiff in the face while wearing what resembled military boots.'

Bilzerian told People he did no such thing.

'I don't believe in violence against women...I would never assault a woman. It got blown so far out of proportion,' he said.

Bilzerian said his name was cleared after Miami Beach police did a 'full investgation.' 

'They got the club's [surveillance] video, which is much better and clearer than the handheld video that was posted online. And it shows that I didn't kick anyone.'

Just after news of Castano's allegations broke, grainy phone footage of Bilzerian in the club that night surface and some believed it was damaging to the 34-year-old. 

Likes guns: Bilzerian was also recently in hot water for blowing up homemade explosives in the Nevada desert in November

Pleaded no contest: Police alleged that Bilzerian and a friend fired a rifle from a distance to detonate more than 90 pounds of a powdered explosive mix packed into a beverage cooler to destroy a tractor-trailer cab they'd brought to the site. They left behind a small wildfire 

Also in December, Bilzerian and a friend were arrested in Los Angeles for the detonation of a homemade explosive beneath a tractor-trailer cab.

The November 4 explosion sparked a small wildfire and Bilzerian in February entered a no-contest plea to misdemeanor failing to extinguish a fire. He and the friend coughed up $20,000 in restitution.

Bilzerian's lawyer, David Chesnoff, told a judge his client would also record a public service announcement for the federal Bureau of Land Management to resolve the criminal case.

Police alleged that the men fired a rifle from a distance to detonate more than 90 pounds of a powdered explosive mix packed into a beverage cooler to destroy the tractor-trailer cab, which they brought to the site. Truck parts scattered some 300 yards, investigators said. The fire was quickly contained. 

An online boast about shooting a 20-mm rifle put Bilzerian at the scene, according to a police report, and a Bureau of Land Management ranger reported stopping Guymon driving Bilzerian's truck shortly after the blast a short distance away

Bilzerian entertains millions of Instagram followers with accounts of his exploits and photos featuring parties, private jets, scantily clad women, piles of cash and weapons. Some show him shooting guns in the desert.

He made a splash in April throwing a naked porn actress from a roof into a pool during an adult magazine photo shoot. The woman broke her foot and threatened to sue, drawing a mocking response from a Bilzerian lawyer who said that if she went to court she'd lose everything.
