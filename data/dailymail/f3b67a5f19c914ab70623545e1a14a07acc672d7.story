Ruling: A Muslim woman has been allowed to enter a plea without removing her full-face veil (library image)

A Muslim woman has been allowed to appear in court as a defendant and enter a plea without removing her full-face veil.

The woman, who denied a charge of witness intimidation, had previously been told by Judge Peter Murphy that she would have to show her face to enter a plea so she could be conclusively identified.

The same judge today backed down and allowed her to enter the dock to plead not guilty while wearing a niqab at Blackfriars Crown Court.

Judge Murphy will give directions on Monday as to whether the woman can stand trial while wearing a veil that shows only her eyes.

The woman, from east London, who cannot be identified for legal reason, had argued that she was unable to remove the face covering in the presence of men for religious reasons.

But compromise was met today when a female police officer, who saw 
her face when she was photographed after her arrest, had a private 
viewing with her in a room at the court.

The officer then swore on oath that it was the same woman.

Judge Murphy said: 'I would be satisfied for the officer giving evidence, having seen the defendant backstage so to speak in a private setting, saying she could identify her.'

The defendant's barrister, Susan Meek, argued that she had a right to wear the veil during today's proceedings and her trial in November under Article 9 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which safeguards religious beliefs.

She also highlighted the 'tolerant' approach taken to Islamic dress in the UK.

Ms Meek said: 'She is entitled to wear it in private and in public.

'That right to wear the niqab also extends to the courtroom.

'There is no legislation in the UK in respect of the wearing of the niqab.

'There is no law in this country banning it.'

She added that the same rules would apply to witnesses or victims of crime who appeared in court.

She
 also pointed out that the defendant's only active participation in her 
trial would be giving evidence, if she does so, and suggested the jury 
would be able to make a judgment based on her answers and body language 
despite the veil.

Ms Meek added: 'Ultimately it's the choice of the defendant if she wishes to wear it.

'If
 she chooses to remain with her face veil on when giving evidence that 
is something she will no doubt be spoken to about by the judge in front 
of the jury.

Hearing: The woman, who appeared before Blackfriars Crown Court, pictured, was charged with witness intimidation

'To ask her to remove it, if that is the court's opinion at the end of it, what consequences follow? A court order and proceedings of contempt? Is that right and fair?'

The defendant today pleaded not guilty to charges of intimidating a witness in Finsbury Park, north London, in June.

She will appear back at Blackfriars Crown Court on Monday at 11am, ahead of her trial due to take place on November 4.

After the woman had entered her not guilty plea, Miss Meek and Judge Murphy continued to debate the wearing of the veil for the trial.

Judge Murphy pondered whether the wearing of a veil could affect the jury 'to a significant degree by them being unable to see her reaction to questions being put'.

Miss Meek said: 'Whether the jury would find it more difficult is really where the question begins.

'Jurors could look at her body language and eyes to evaluate her character.'

'There is always going to be a photo of her.

'The jury could be shown that.'

On Tuesday, Muslim students were banned from wearing religious veils into a college because of fears regarding security.

Teenagers at Birmingham Metropolitan College were told to remove any items of clothing covering their faces so they are 'easily identifiable at all times'.

The French caused controversy back in 2011 around the world when they moved to ban women from wearing the burkha in public.

Politicians moved to ban the veil because they argued it was a security risk and said it was a social hindrance.

The
 law - which sparked protests in Pakistan - was brought into effect in 
2011 under the leadership of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy.

British politicians are also no stranger to controversy surrounding the burkha.

In
 2006, former Labour Foreign Secretary Jack Straw sparked outrage when 
he said he had ask Muslim women to remove their veils when talking to 
them in his constituency surgery.

Three
 years ago Conservative MP Philip Hollobone tabled a private members' 
bill which would have made it illegal for anyone to cover their face in 
public.

However, the bill 
fell by the parliamentary wayside following claims that bringing in such
 a law could be in breach of the Equality Act.
