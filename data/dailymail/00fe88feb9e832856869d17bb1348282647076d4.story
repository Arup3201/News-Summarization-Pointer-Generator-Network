At first sight the female bus passenger appears to be suffering from a bad stomach ache.

But soon the incredible CCTV footage shows the 39-year-old, named as Wang Liyang, reaching into her clothes and delivering her own baby as a fascinated child - thought to be her three-year-old son - watches beside her.

The incredible video shows other passengers eventually coming to the woman's aid as the bus is driven at high speed towards hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan province, China.

Scroll down for video:

Shocking: CCTV footage from the bus shows a stream of amniotic fluid on the floor as the pregnant woman, named as 39-year-old Wang Liyang, sits doubled over in pain

Pains: Ms Liyang can be seen reaching into her clothes as the baby boy begins to be born. A boy, thought to be her son watches from beside her as the drama unfolds

Birth: The newborn baby can be seen on his mother's lap as a fellow passenger (left) carries on with her journey apparently unaware of the drama behind her

Ms Liying reportedly boarded the number 666 bus with her three-year-old son after feeling pains and was heading to Chengdu Medical College so she could be checked over, according to LiveLeak.com.

The CCTV footage clearly shows amniotic fluid flowing along the floor in front of her after her waters broke. Fellow passengers asked her if she was alright, but she was unable to speak due to the intense pain.

After being alerted to what was happening, the bus driver put his foot down and headed directly towards the 
hospital in Chengdu. Passengers can then be seen giving Ms Liying blankets to keep the baby warm.

Helping hand: She holds the baby upside down and gently pats his bottom in an apparent attempt to clear his airway

Warmth: She wraps her child in a blanket given to her by a fellow passenger. The incredible birth was over in a matter of minutes

Safe: The newborn is covered in an extra blanket as the bus rushes towards hospital

After
giving birth, Ms Liyang can be seen holding her wet baby upside down 
and patting his bottom in an apparent attempt to help clear his airways.

Other passengers desperately waved down a passing 
ambulance which reportedly took her the rest of the way to hospital.

The baby, a boy weighing seven pounds three ounces, and his mother are believed to be in 'good shape' following the drama.
