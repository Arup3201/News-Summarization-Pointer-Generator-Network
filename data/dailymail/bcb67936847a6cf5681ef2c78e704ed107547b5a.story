Two brothers have taken inspiration from their childhoods in South Africa by turning oil cans into electric guitars.

Adam and Shaun Lee, from Georgia, USA, grew up in Johannesburg and saw how musicians in the country's townships would create musical instruments out of discarded items.

Now their company Bohemian Guitars is making six-strings out of tin cans, creating a 'clean bluesy twang', and plunging the profits into music education for children.

Adam Lee, 27, said: 'The guitars are interesting and produce really unique bluesy sound. Our instruments also encourage people to want to learn how to play guitar.

'The first Bohemian Guitar was built with parts from deconstructed instruments and an old rusty gas can to build an oil can guitar.

'Since then we have come a long way, and significant improvements have been made to our design resulting in some artists opting to play our guitar over some of the bigger known brands.'

The Lee brothers roped in friends Mark Friedman, 28, and Josh Kirsca, 24, to launch the business from their parents' basement last year.

They make the guitars in three styles - Bohemian Honey, Bohemian Motor Oil and Bohemian Moonshine - with maple necks and rosewood fingerboards.

The necks have 24 frets and a scale length of roughly 26 inches.

Now the musical quartet have embarked on raising money through the Kickstarter website.

They have raised $32,000 in donations in only a week - and $270 gets you the first go on their upcoming one gallon oil can guitar as soon as May this year.

For each guitar bought, Bohemian Guitars gives one instrument away.

Adam Lee said: 'To us, this Kickstarter campaign has not only help us create one-of-a-kind, quality instruments, but has also supported our mission to sustain the future of music education for kids - a key component of why we do what we do.'
