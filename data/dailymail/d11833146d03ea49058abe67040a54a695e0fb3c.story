Noma restaurant in Copenhagen, Denmark, has real straw, live ants and fish scales on its menu

It has been voted the world’s best restaurant for four out of the past five years – but Michelin starred Noma’s co-founder will today reveal that his own father is not a fan.

In an interview on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, the Danish chef Rene Redzepi reveals that his Macedonian father, who grew up in poverty, remains unimpressed by both his success and the menu at his Copenhagen restaurant, which includes real straw, live ants and fish scales.

Redzepi, 36, says: ‘My mother is so proud but my father, it’s not for him.

‘He grew up after the Second World War in the former Yugoslavia eating the same pot of beans every day.

When presenter Kirsty Young asks the chef if the food is too rarefied for his father he replies: ‘It’s just not for him’. 

'When we got our second Michelin star he said, “That’s good son, now you can support your family.”

To him the measure of success is that you can support your family.

That’s what worried him most of his life.’ 

Luckily, not everyone shares his father’s taste.

A pop-up Noma at Claridge’s in London quickly sold out in 2012, despite a nine-course Nordic lunch costing £195.

Noma prides itself on the fact that 80 per cent of the ingredients on the menu are vegetables.

The restaurant has its own team of foragers who collect ingredients from all over Scandinavia and Redzepi will today admit that his team can spend months working on ‘a carrot dish’.

But the chef also said that building up the business had a terrible impact on his health and almost caused him to have a breakdown.

He revealed that the pressures became so great that he found himself becoming a tyrant in his own kitchen. 

He said: ‘I was terrible. I had always told myself I wasn’t going to be like that. In some kitchens I had been in I had even seen people getting beat up.

'I wasn’t going to be like that. But suddenly you are there and the pressure it grows and it grows and grows. And there is no money. I started becoming very angry and very miserable.’

Redzepi whose song choices include Under Pressure by David Bowie and Queen recalled the moment he realised he couldn’t go on.

He said: ‘It’s not that many years ago.  It was Spring and we were busy as usual and under staffed as usual. I was walking to work and out of the blue  I had this overwhelming feeling of not being able to walk any more. I remember telling myself I feel like laying down and crying.

'I stood there and I felt so weak. Like I have never felt before. I probably stood there for five or six minutes. And I already sort of surrendered to the thought that this was going to happen. And I was thinking who is going to take care of me? 

'Who can carry me back to my apartment?  I was really, really, really having one of those crazy moments. I haven’t had it since luckily.’

The chef said it was the thought of an apprentice struggling to cope in his absence which brought him back to his senses.
