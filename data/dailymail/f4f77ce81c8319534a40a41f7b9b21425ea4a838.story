Ed Balls faced calls to 'come clean' about Labour's failure to tackle tax evasion while he was City Minister in the wake of revelations HSBC helped 7,000 wealthy Britons avoid millions of pounds in tax.

Britain's biggest bank is alleged to have used its Swiss private banking arm to help their super-rich clients, including celebrities and royalty, to evade tax and also advised them how to stay one step ahead of UK tax law. 

The Tories and Lib Dems seized on the revelation to question the role of Mr Balls, who was City Minister from May 2006 to June 2007.

But Labour responded with questions about why former HSBC boss Stephen Green was appointed a Tory peer and trade minister by David Cameron. 

The Tories and Lib Dems said the revelations raised questions about the role of Labour's Ed Balls, who was City Minister from May 2006 to June 2007. The man in charge of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green, was made a Conservative Peer and appointed to the government

The banking documents which form the expose have now become the biggest banking leak in history, The Guardian reported.

Among them are the revelations HSBC's Swiss bank allowed its clients to withdraw bricks of cash, allowed clients to conceal undeclared 'black accounts' and gave accounts to criminals and corrupt businessmen. 

HMRC says that £135million in tax, interest and penalties has now been paid by those who hid their assets in Switzerland.

HSBC claims that since the documents were leaked, it has radically overhauled its private banking business and reduced the number of Swiss accounts by almost 70 per cent since 2007. 

It was revealed after a whistleblower leaked details of 30,000 accounts holding £78billion between 2005 and 2007, with a quarter said to be held by Britons.

Hollywood stars, royalty, Europe's richest families as well as relatives of dictators and people implicated in cases of African corruption are also said to held an account to help them evade tax.

In one example, HSBC's Swiss bankers were prepared to help Emmanuel Shallop - a man later convicted of dealing in blood diamonds. 

Coalition ministers sought to pin the blame for the failure to act on the last Labour government, pointing the finger at Mr Balls.

And former Labour minister Margaret Hodge appeared to admit there had been less enthusiasm for clamping down on tax avoidance under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown because there was no shortage of money. 

Speaking during a visit to Chester, David Cameron said: 'Stephen Green was an excellent trade minister, he did a good job. But I'd also add no Government has done more than this one to crackdown on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance.

'I put it absolutely at the head of my G8 agenda, to make sure there's more tax transparency, the big companies pay their taxes properly and that we raise money from people previously evading and avoiding tax and will go on doing that as a Government.'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'I think it would be great if Ed Balls for once or Ed Miliband would get up and admit that they let the banks run riot on their watch.

‘Ed Balls went on a prawn cocktail charm offensive to suck up to the banks and they now have the brass neck to somehow constantly accuse this government of not doing enough.’ 

The Lib Dem leader claimed his party had warned Mr Brown and Mr Balls that the lack of proper bank regulation was 'going to end in a car crash'.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Ed Balls went on a prawn cocktail charm offensive to suck up to the banks, yet they now have the brass neck to somehow constantly accuse this government of not doing enough when we've done considerably more to try and straighten out the banks than Labour ever did.

Labour MP Margaret Hodge said there was less pressure to tackle tax avoidance when the public finances 'were not under such tension'

'So, actually, I think it would be very helpful if he actually for once came clean and was honest about the fact that the banks went awry on all sorts of fronts during Labour's term in office.' 

Conservative Treasury minister David Gauke said Panorama 'throws a spotlight on the opportunities for tax evasion on the eve of the financial crash in 2007'. 

‘Clearly HSBC have got questions to answer,’ he said. ‘In terms of Stephen Green, I don’t think there is any suggestion or any evidence that he was involved or engaged in some of the behaviour that occurred in the subsidiary in Switzerland.’ 

He added: 'It is for HSBC to explain what they did to ensure their clients complied with the tax law. But it is for the City Minister in years up to 2007, Ed Balls, to make an urgent statement about what he knew about all this and why the then government allowed tax avoidance and evasion to take place on such a scale. 

'Since 2010 we have closed many of the loopholes exposed in this report and specifically taken action to get back money lost in Swiss Bank Accounts.' 

Mrs Hodge, the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said HMRC had not been sufficiently determined in tackling dodgy practices.

She told BBC Radio 4': 'If it had been a benefit cheat it would have been up for court years ago. Now we have had only one tax cheat taken before the British courts.' 

But she admitted that many of the activities took place while Labour was in power.

'I think that times have changed and we have to move on. You have to remember in times past public finances were not under such tension, there weren't so many demands on them, you didn't have the deficit.'

The man in charge of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green, was made a Conservative Peer and appointed to the government.

Lord Green was made a Minister eight months after HMRC had been given the leaked documents from his bank. He served as a Minister of Trade and Investment until 2013.

Lord Green told Panorama: 'As a matter of principle I will not comment on the business of HSBC past or present.'

Mr Balls said: 'There are very serious questions for George Osborne and David Cameron to answer today.

'Why, in the five years since this government was first given information about how HSBC helped people evade tax, has there only been one prosecution out of 1100 individuals identified?

'And why did they appoint the Chairman of HSBC as a Tory Minister eight months after the government was told about the bank's activities?

'Nobody will fall for yet more desperate distraction tactics from George Osborne and the Tories when it is clear that this information was first given to the government in 2010.

'That is why the Chancellor should come to the House of Commons and answer questions about this today.'

In an urgent question in the Commons, shadow treasury minister Shabana Mahmood asked what information the Government had sought from him about the claims of tax avoidance made in 2010 before he was made a minister.

Any failure to do so would be an 'inexplicable and inexcusable abdication of responsibility', she told MPs.

She said: 'We need much more detail ... as to what the Government has been up to since they were made aware of this information.'

Who had seen it in 2010, she asked, and what was done with it? Were ministers informed, she continued, and if not why?

'Any failure by this Government to question him [Lord Green] before his appointment would be an inexplicable and inexcusable abdication of responsibility,' she went on.

Labour leader Ed Miliband told Sky News: 'I think this is a very serious situation and the Government has some serious questions to answer.' 

Mrs Hodge claimed Lord Green faced 'serious questions'. 'Either he didn't know and he was asleep at the wheel, or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices,' Mrs Hodge said.

'Either way he was the man in charge and I think he has got really important questions to answer.'

However, Labour frontbencher Rachel Reeves insisted revelations about HSBC did not emerge until 2010, so it was not something that Mr Balls could have taken action on. 

HSBC is alleged to have helped wealthy customes hide their cash and assets from the government to avoid paying their full tax bills

Shadow financial secretary to the treasury Cathy Jamieson said: 'HMRC were made fully aware of these practices back in 2010. There are serious questions for the Chancellor to answer about why just one person out of over a thousand have been prosecuted in five years.

'And why the Government's Swiss tax deal has been such an embarrassing flop, raising a fraction of the amounts initially boasted of by ministers.'

'Tax avoidance and evasion harms every taxpayer in Britain, and undermines public services like the NHS.' 

Offshore accounts are not illegal but they are often used as a way of hiding earnings from HM Revenue and Customs. However, deliberately hiding money to evade tax is illegal.

But even though 1,100 people who had not paid what they should have done were identified,  five years later only one person has been prosecuted.

HSBC has today admitted wrongdoing in Switzerland but said that it has now 'fundamentally changed' since then.

Claims the bank routinely used its Swiss operations to help clients shield their true value from the taxman were revealed by a BBC Panorama investigation. 

It found HSBC helped clients to hide money from domestic tax authorities in secret 'black' accounts.

Accounts were held by the rich and powerful, as well as criminals and corrupt businessmen.

Bank's staff allowed clients to withdraws large bundles of cash and emails reveal they were aware the account holders did so because they were 'under pressure from the  tax authorities'.

Panorama will air on BBC1 tonight and has seen thousands of leaked accounts showing how bankers helped clients – nearly 7,000 of them British – to avoid taxes.

Some account details were stolen by a computer hacker in 2007 and were presented to HMRC in 2010. 

Panorama spoke to a whistleblower who said HSBC had still failed to implement changes when she worked there in 2013.

Sue Shelley, who was the private bank's head of compliance in Luxembourg, said: 'The verbal messages were great but they weren't put into practice.'

She was sacked after raising concerns and an unfair dismissal tribunal ruled in her favour.
