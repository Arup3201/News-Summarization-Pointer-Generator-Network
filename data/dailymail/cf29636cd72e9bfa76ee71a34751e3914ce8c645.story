President Barack Obama has stepped up his battle to close Guantanamo Bay, summoning top officials to the White House to push for the notorious detention centre to close.

But the President, who made a pledge to close the prison on the day he took office in 2008, is likely to face tough opposition from Congress which has ruled out transferring any prisoners to the U.S.

This means Obama may have to send inmates abroad if he wishes to close the jail, but the administration does not want to release all prisoners - including five suspected 9/11 plotters.

The President, who made a pledge to close the prison on the day he took office in 2008, is likely to face tough opposition from Congress in his bid to shut down Guantanamo

At the meeting, last month, Obama lectured officials on his own administration's failure to close down Guantanamo, where more than a hundred prisoners remain interred. 

Since that meeting, a dozen prisoners have been transferred overseas, with another five expected to leave the U.S. naval base in Cuba before the end of the year.

The prison population is at its lowest point since shortly after it opened in 2002, with just 136 left, of which half are cleared to leave the detention centre. At its peak, Guantanamo held 700 suspects.

But actually closing Guantanamo would either require approval from Congress, which has prohibited transferring any prisoners to the U.S., or the transfer of potentially dangerous individuals to other countries - which Obama's opponents are warning him against but administration officials say hasn't been ruled out.

'We're working on it,' Obama said at a bookstore over the Thanksgiving weekend when a shopper expressed hope Guantanamo will close.

The President wants to close the detention centre because he believes it is unnecessary, expensive at more than $440million a year, and to be a propaganda tool for the country's enemies.

But members of Congress argue that it should remain open to hold and question terrorism suspects, and that dangerous inmates should not be moved to America.

Most prisoners cleared for transfers are from Yemen, where a violent al-Qaeda-linked group makes it too unstable to send them home. 

But the day after Obama's meeting, Georgia and Slovakia accepted the first Yemenis to leave since 2010, proving that resettlement elsewhere is an option.

Administration officials say more prisoners who previously were classified as too dangerous to be let out are expected to be cleared for transfer in an ongoing review.

But the administration doesn't want to release some detainees, including the prisoners facing trial by military commission for war crimes — a group that includes five men charged with planning and aiding the 9/11 attacks. 

Administration officials said the president's message in the November 19 White House meeting was primarily directed at Hagel, who was reluctant to sign off on guarantees that those transferred would not pose a security threat.

Five days after that meeting, Hagel resigned under pressure, with administration officials saying Guantanamo was one of the issues behind his departure.

His replacement, Ashton Carter, would not have been chose for the job if he did not understand closure of the prison was a priority, an anonymous official told the Associated Press.
