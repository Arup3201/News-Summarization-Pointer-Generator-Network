Fillip: In a pre-election boost for Chancellor George Osborne, an influential think tank increased its forecast for GDP growth this year to 2.9 per cent

The slump in oil prices is fuelling the fastest growth in the UK economy since before the financial crisis, according to a leading think-tank.

In a pre-election boost for Chancellor George Osborne, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research increased its forecast for GDP growth this year to 2.9 per cent – the highest since 2006, when it reached 3 per cent.

In November it predicted the economy would grow 2.4 per cent this year, but the think-tank said its ‘significant’ revision is ‘almost entirely due to the sharp fall in oil price’, which has halved in value from $115 a barrel in June to just under $60 now.

The benefits are already filtering through to households, with lower petrol prices and energy bills helping to push inflation down to 0.5 per cent.

In a speech on Thursday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney is expected to say that Britain faces its first period of deflation – or falling prices – in more than half a century. 

This will fuel speculation the Bank will leave interest rates on hold at a record low of 0.5 per cent, providing more breathing space for homeowners.

Falling prices and rising wages have presented a dilemma for Labour, which has centred its General Election campaign on the ‘cost of living crisis’ in the UK.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls recently dismissed figures that the UK had the fastest growing economy among the G7 nations – the world’s seven leading economies – in 2014, arguing that working people are ‘still not feeling the recovery’.

But Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at analysts Capital Economics, said: ‘This is coming at just the right time for Mr Osborne. The falling oil price is providing a considerable boost for households.’

In another boost for Mr Osborne, NIESR also predicted unemployment would fall faster than previously expected, dropping from its current rate of 5.9 per cent to 5.2 per cent by the end of the year. This equates to more than 200,000 extra people finding work.

But it issued a cautionary note, warning that ‘the weakness of the global economy – and in particular the euro area, by far the UK’s biggest trading partner – remains a hindrance to a significant improvement’.

John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce said: ‘I have detected a much higher degree of confidence about the future among businesses.’

 

Labour's plans to slow the pace of spending cuts will generate more economic growth in the next Parliament, according to the NIESR.

The think-tank predicts that plans for higher public borrowing by a Labour or Liberal Democrat government would provide a 1 per cent boost to GDP by the final year of the next Parliament. This compared with a 0.4-0.6 per cent boost by 2019 in plans outlined by Chancellor George Osborne in his Autumn Statement in December. It also believes that unemployment would be reduced faster under Labour’s plans.

But NIESR also stressed there would be no longer-term boost to the economy from whittling down the £91billion budget deficit more slowly. It added that less focus on reducing the deficit would also lead to higher interest rates and spending cuts further down the line.

The Chancellor wants to balance the country’s books faster than Labour. He has asked forecasting watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility to assume a budget surplus of £23billion in 2019-20. This implies plans to make larger spending cuts than those laid out by the other parties.
