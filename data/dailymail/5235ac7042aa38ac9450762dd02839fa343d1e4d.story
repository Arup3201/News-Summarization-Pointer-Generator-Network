Handoko Njotokusuma’s pet dogs are a pair of real ruff riders.

His beloved golden retrievers – Ace and Armani – cruise through Surabaya, Indonesia, while perched on the handlebars or the pillion of his motorised scooter.

Wearing helmets and red- or green-framed sunglasses, the dogs and their owner have become local celebrities – drawing curious stares and stunned looks from passers-by.

Handoko’s four-legged companions sandwich him on the bike as they cruise through the streets of Indonesia’s second-largest city.

They attract plenty of attention and often stop to pose for photos with onlookers.

Ace and Armani – two of Handoko’s four dogs – have been riding since they were just a few months old and now at the age of three they jump onto the scooter whenever they think their owner is heading out. The 59-year-old businessman takes the two pooches for 30-minute journeys around the city.

He said: ‘When they were four months old I taught them to sit on the front of my motorbike. And then at eight months they started to learn to sit on the back seat.

‘Since then, they are always interested to get onto the bike. When I start the engine they jump straight onto the chair. They seem ready to go.’

He added: ‘Lots of people are entertained with how they act. So many people take pictures of them.

‘Some of them stop me just to have a picture with them. Those moments make me happy every day.’

But it took some time to train the dogs to ride the bike with him at the same time.

Due to their talents Handoko has turned down a number of expensive offers for his pet dogs

Handoko said: ‘Armani is the one who can only sit on the back but Ace can sit on both the front and the back.

‘I think it is because I was late to teach Armani how to sit on the motorbike. When I taught them, I taught them one by one.

‘After they learned how to sit I took them both at the same time.’

Due to their talents Handoko has received a number of expensive offers for his pet dogs, but he insists he will never sell them.

He said: ‘For me, they are my children. I love them so much, just as much as I love my wife and my biological children.

‘There are some people that come to me to ask whether I can sell the dogs. They gave me a high price. But I can’t ever let them go. I love them. Till their last breath.’
