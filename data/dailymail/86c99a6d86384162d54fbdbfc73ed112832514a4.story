Danny Welbeck will be facing Manchester United on Saturday at the Emirates for the first time, but will he follow in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo and Mark Hughes by scoring in his opening match against his former club?

Looking back at Premier League history, the England striker may not hold the highest hope of hitting the back of the net. The likes of Ronaldo and Hughes have a good record against United, but they are one of very few.

The Portuguese superstar has scored two in two games for Real Madrid having moved to Spain in 2009, while Hughes scored in his first game against United in October 1995 after leaving in the summer.

But Welbeck will want to avoid joining the likes of Teddy Sheringham, Dwight Yorke, Louis Saha and Dimitar Berbatov in being unable to net after leaving Old Trafford.

Here, Sportsmail looks at the hits and misses of former Red Devils strikers.

Cristiano Ronaldo - 2 goals in 2 games against United since leaving

Ronaldo left for Real Madrid for £80million in 2009, and came back to haunt them in the Champions League last 16 first and second leg in 2013. He scored the equaliser in the 1-1 draw at the Bernabeu, then the winning goal in the 2-1 win at Old Trafford in the return leg.
