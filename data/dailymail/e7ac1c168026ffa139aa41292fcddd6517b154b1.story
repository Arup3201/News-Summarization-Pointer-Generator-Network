China is set to remove more than five million ageing cars from its roads this year in a bid to combat pollution, it was revealed today.

Vehicles will be 'eliminated' throughout the country to improve air quality, with 330,000 to be decommissioned in Beijing alone, according to a Government policy document.

The move will affect cars that are 'yellow label' - meaning they fail to meet Chinese fuel standards.

The plans, unveiled in the document by China's cabinet, the State Council, aim to reverse the damage done by decades of breakneck growth.

They also aspire to head off public anger about the state of the nation's air, water and soil.

In the document, officials - for whom, pollution has emerged as an urgent priority - said the country had already fallen behind in its air quality targets from 2011 to 2013.

So, as part of a plan to cut emissions over the next two years, up to 5.33million vehicles that fail to meet Chinese fuel standards will be decommissioned, they said.

Beijing alone plans to
 'eliminate' 330,000 'cars this year - taking the total number of 
vehicles on its roads to 5.6 million, allowed to rise to
 six million by 2017.

And a further 660,000 vehicles will be withdrawn from the surrounding province of Hebei, which was home to seven of China's smoggiest cities last year.

According to Beijing's environmental watchdog, vehicle emissions in the capital were responsible for about 31 per cent of the hazardous airborne smog particles, known as PM 2.5.

Over 22 per cent of these particles had originated from coal burning.

Officials have now set new targets for the closure of coal-fired heating systems, as well as the installation of equipment to reduce sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions at power stations, steel mills and cement plants.

The document said China is aiming to cut carbon emissions per unit of economic growth by more than 4 percent this year - and more than 3.5 percent in 2015.

It is hoped that this will enable the country to meet its binding 17-per-cent target set in its 2011-2015 five-year plan.

The document added that China hopes to reduce energy consumption per unit of growth by 3.9 per cent this year, and the next, in order to meet a 16 per cent target for the 2011-2015 period.

And the country aims to meet its 2011-2015 targets to cut outdated capacity in sectors like steel, glassmaking and cement by the end of this year - one year ahead of schedule.

On top of the original targets, China will also close an additional 15 million tonnes of steel smelting capacity and 100 million tonnes of cement making capacity next year, the document said.

And the country will step up efforts to create market mechanisms to reduce pollution, with the aim of establishing nationwide platforms that would allow enterprises to trade energy consumption and emission permits.

Officials also promised to provide more policy support for China's clean-up programme, implement a new differential power pricing system aimed at encouraging efficiency, and punish wasteful enterprises, as well as improve financial support for projects designed to reduce emissions.
