California police are searching for two men after a masked gunman held up a bank, getting away with cash from the vault.

The terrifying raid at the Santa Ana branch of a US Bank was caught on security cameras, as the masked man forced customers and employees to lie face-down on the floor on Tuesday morning.

A woman who works at the bank was then taken, at gun point, to the vault where the robber stole what has been described by police as a substantial amount of money.

'This situation is pretty bold,' Sergeant Jose Gonzalez, of Santa Ana Police Department, said.

'This
is something that you see clearly in movies where an individual comes 
in and completely takes over a business,' he told KTLA.

Wearing a mask and dark clothing to hide his identity, the gunman forced everyone inside the bank to the ground at about 9.40am.

He then used a trash bag to collect the money from the vault and drawers of the Grand Avenue branch.

The gunman, and a second man suspected of being his lookout, escaped into the bank's car park through a side entrance, and jumped over a wall and into apartment complex, leaving a trail of thousands of dollars as they fled.

'I just found a bunch of $50 bills just floating around in two yards here,' Don Webb, who lives in the Fairhaven neighborhood of Santa Ana, said.

Mr Webb, who is president of the Fairview Home Owner's Association, says when he realized the money he had found was probably stolen he dropped it to the ground and called police.

The Orange County’s Bank Robbery Task Force collected thousands of dollars in the neighborhood after the raid, according to CBS Los Angeles.

A potential witness also handed in footage he took of his mobile phone, which shows a man acting suspiciously and appearing to throw something away.

'It’s struck a nerve… I kind of saw 
him walking and within a couple of minutes officers just started 
storming the scene,' the witness, who did not want to be identified, told KTLA5.

Santa Ana police have not yet confirmed if the man is connected to the raid.

No one was injured in the raid but the US 
Bank is offering a $10,000 reward for anyone who can help catch the men.

The robbers are described as African-Americans, who are about 5ft 8in to 6ft.
