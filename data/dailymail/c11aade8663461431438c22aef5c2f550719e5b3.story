The full circumstances of the shooting - the latest in a very long line across the city (although most have occurred in the west and southwest, not the inner-west) - remain unclear.

It's being investigated by Strike Force Talon - the operation set up to combat street gun crime.

Inspector Michael Dykes was due to make a plea for help and witnesses late on Tuesday night.
