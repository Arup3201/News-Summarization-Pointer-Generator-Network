Patrick Vieira's Manchester City Elite Development Squad saw their Barclays Under 21 Premier League title hopes take a hit as an own goal gifted West Ham a deserved victory over them at Upton Park.

A Dan Potts header and Adam Drury's own goal gave West Ham a two-goal lead before Olivier Ntcham pulled back a goal for City, but it was not enough.

Patrick Vieira's side were missing a number of players who were busy preparing for Monday night's FA Youth Cup final second leg against Chelsea, when they will be looking to overturn a 3-1 deficit at Stamford Bridge.

Dan Potts scored the opener to set West Ham on their way before an own goal doubled their lead

Patrick Vieira witnessed his Manchester City Under 21s side lose to West Ham  at Upton Park on Friday

West Ham United: Spiegel, Knoyle, Page (c), Nasha (Mavila 80), Pask, Potts, Ward (Pike 72), Makasi, Brown, Diangana, Parfitt-Williams.

Unused subs: Bogard, Westley, Hector-Ingram.

Manchester City: Gunn, Drury, Oliver, Smith-Brown, Horsfield, Holland, Intima, Ntcham, Pozo, Glendon (c), Dilrosum (Nuttall 60).

Unused subs: Tattum, O'Brien, Bullock, Fernandes.

Under the Upton Park lights, the hosts took the lead inside just 11 minutes. A Djair Parfitt-Williams cross came in from the right and full back  Potts was the surprise recipient, popping up to head past Angus Gunn at the far post.

City rallied and Potts proved his worth at the other end, clearing Jorge Intima's strike off the line following a corner.

The visitors were in the ascendency going into half-time but within nine minutes of the restart West Ham had doubled their lead and this time it was a gift.

Jordan Brown fired in a teasing cross and Drury could only stab into his own net in an attempt to clear.

Olivier Ntcham, pictured playing against Roma earlier this season, pulled one back but it was in vain

City finally pulled one back with 14 minutes to go when Ntcham rounded goalkeeper Raphael Spiegel to half the deficit.

Tom Holland and Jose Pozo both went close to levelling matters and substitute Fernandes shot wide when he maybe should have scored.

But the Hammers held on for three points as City's title hopes at Under 21 level took a hit.Â
