A handful of history buffs and curious onlookers watched today as a 
bulldozer tore through the walls of a dilapidated apartment building 
where Lee Harvey Oswald lived a few months before the assassination of 
President John F. Kennedy.

The uninhabited 10-unit, two-story apartment complex built in 1925 
was one of several remaining places tied to Kennedy's Nov. 22, 1963, 
assassination, which remains perhaps the most infamous moment in Dallas 
history. Oswald lived at the building at 600 Elsbeth St. with his wife, 
Marina, and young daughter from November 1962 to March 1963.

The residence is mentioned in the Warren Commission report that investigated Kennedy's death and concluded Oswald acted alone.

It's history: The Dallas apartment building where Lee Harvey Oswald lived shortly before President Kennedy was assassinated is demolished today.

The bulldozer ramming through the walls started with the side where 
Oswald lived.

Police blocked off Elsbeth Street and the sidewalk in 
front, but let onlookers grab bricks from the side of the building.

Tom Sclar, a local resident and musician, put five bricks in a 
backpack as souvenirs and possibly sale items later. Sclar said the 
building was included on tours he once gave to groups interested in the 
many alternate theories about Kennedy's death.

"People sell this crap for money," Sclar said. "I'm doing it out of a weird, kitschy interest."

Jose Sorola said he was fascinated by the history of two presidential
 assassins — Oswald and John Wilkes Booth, who killed Abraham Lincoln.

Sorola had heard about the upcoming demolition on the news and 
eventually purchased an apartment window for $125 online. His goal, he 
said, was to build a "traveling wall" around the window so it could be 
displayed to others.

"He still lived here, and in my opinion, he's a part of Dallas 
history," Sorola said. "Maybe for the wrong reason, but he's still a 
part of history."

Kennedy's assassination still generates plenty of controversy, 
particularly as theories still circulate about whether Oswald acted 
alone.

President Kennedy's nephew, Robert Kennedy Jr., said over the weekend that he believes a second gunman was involved and that his father, Robert Kennedy, who was Attorney General at the time, was privately dismissive of the Warren Commission.

That report says Oswald shot Kennedy from the 
sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building — now a museum 
dedicated to Kennedy and the assassination. The Warren Commission also 
concluded that Oswald killed Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit 45 
minutes after Kennedy was shot.

Oswald was arrested in the hours after the assassination, but was killed two days later by nightclub owner Jack Ruby.

Gary Mack, curator of the Sixth Floor Museum, said Oswald ordered the
 revolver that killed Tippit in January 1963, when Oswald was living at 
the Elsbeth Street apartment. But, he added, "The most important parts 
of the Oswald story are what he did, not where he did them."

Jane Bryant bought the apartment building in 2007 but was never able 
to realize plans to renovate it. The city got a court order last May to 
have it razed and took over demolition when Bryant failed to act quickly
 enough.

The city estimated demolition and asbestos abatement would run about 
$52,000 and said it may put a lien on the property to recover its costs.

Bryant was emotional about seeing the building being demolished. She previously told the LA Times that she hadn't known that the process had begun until she was informed by a reporter.

'The city of Dallas told me if I was 
making progress on the building, they would stop it,' Bryant said. 
'They agreed to give me more time.' 

The owner had been trying to salvage the valuable and historic parts of the building that was built in 1925. She believed she had around two weeks left.

Bryant has already sold the toilet and bathtub from Oswald's old apartment but wanted to remove the old pine and white oak from the property.

Crumbling: The disheveled apartment was uninhabited and had a number of building code violations.

She told the LA 
Times that she was trying to contact her lawyer to file a restraining 
order to stop the demolition, and that police on Monday had refused to 
let her into the building.

'We're not just losing a piece
 of fundamental history to Dallas related to the assassination, we're 
also losing a piece of fundamental architecture to this area,' said 
Bryant.

Abandoned: No one has lived in the run-down home for several years

David
 Preziosi, executive director of Preservation Dallas, noted that there 
are more important buildings associated with Oswald than the Elsbeth 
Street apartment, including the boarding house where he was staying the 
day of the assassination and the Texas Theatre, where Oswald was 
arrested.

After leaving the Elsbeth Street 
apartment, Oswald moved a few blocks away, to Neely Street - where the 
famous pictures were taken of him posing in the backyard holding the 
rifle used in the assassination. He was living at a boarding house in 
the same area but on Beckley Avenue when Kennedy was assassinated.

Gone: The owner said that by demolishing the apartment, they are losing a piece of history

Bryant didn't know 
of the site's link to history until the year after she bought it. After a
 local television station did a piece the building she had dreams of 
renovating, people got in contact to let her know of the Oswald 
connection.

She notes that the building has 
been a point of interest, adding that she'd had tourists from overseas 
come by the complex on Thanksgiving.
