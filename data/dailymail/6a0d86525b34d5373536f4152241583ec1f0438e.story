Touts are asking up to £575 a ticket to this year’s Chelsea Flower Show amid huge demand to see Alan Titchmarsh’s first garden there since 1985.

All 161,000 tickets to the world-famous event starting in West London on May 20 have already gone, the  second-fastest sell-out in its history.

The ‘Titchmarsh effect’ has left  gardening fans facing online prices of up to 25 times the face value of the cheapest £23 tickets.

Main attraction: This is the plan for Alan Titchmarsh's Chelsea Flower Show 2014 garden charting his journey from his native Yorkshire to the Isle of Wight, where he has a holiday home

Organisers from the Royal Horticultural Society say that the ‘Titchmarsh effect’ has given the show a big boost.

Only last year’s centenary show, when Prince Harry was involved in a show garden, sold out slightly quicker.

RHS spokeswoman Hayley Monckton said: ‘Alan Titchmarsh is this year’s Prince Harry for us.

‘Alan is one of Britain’s best loved gardeners and everyone is very excited about seeing his garden.’

After over 30 years fronting the BBC’s Chelsea coverage, Titchmarsh chose to step aside this summer when he was demoted to a limited presenting role.

Winning man: Alan Titchmarsh will return to Chelsea Flower Show for the first time since 1985

His Chelsea garden ‘From the Moors to the Sea’ charting his journey from his native Yorkshire to the Isle of Wight, where he has a holiday home, is his first since winning a gold medal in 1985.

Titchmarsh’s ‘joyous celebration of our flowers’ will mark his 50 years as a professional gardener and the 50th anniversary of Britain in Bloom, the annual contest run by the RHS for the country’s most well-tended town.

RHS director general Sue Biggs said: ‘Alan is one of the most powerful forces in horticulture, reaching out to and promoting gardening to millions of people.

‘He has also been one of the biggest supporters of the RHS and, as this garden demonstrates, continues to generously support and promote horticultural campaigns that transform lives and reinforce our great position as a nation of gardeners.’

The face value of the cheapest Chelsea show tickets is £23 for evening entry, rising to £68 for all-day passes.

But amid unprecedented demand, they are being offered on secondary ticketing website seatwave.com for up to £575 each. That price includes a £90 ‘booking fee’.

Similarly, tickets on rival site viagogo.com cost up to £550 each, including a £65 booking fee.

The RHS is urging gardeners not to buy tickets from touts and warning anyone with tickets that turn out to be fakes will be denied entry.

It is trying to deter people from turning to touts by offering special £400 charity tickets to support horticultural apprenticeships.

Ms Monckton said: ‘Once again the cream of the gardening world, from leading designers to specialist nurseries, are creating content, which is so fantastically exciting and spectacular that RHS Chelsea is a sell-out show.

‘As one of Britain’s best loved gardeners, there’s no doubt that Alan Titchmarsh’s return to create a garden with Kate Gould, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Britain in Bloom and his own 50 years in horticulture, has been an additional draw.

‘Please can I urge people not be tempted to buy tickets from touts as you can’t be guaranteed that the tickets they are selling are authentic and you may be refused entry to the show.

‘Instead of lining the pockets of ticket touts, 100 per cent of the funds raised from our £400 tickets will help to make a real difference to the future of horticulture and give people an amazing opportunity to start their career in one of the best industries in the world.

‘With a skills shortage in horticulture, not only will people be supporting a vital initiative but they’ll get exclusive access to RHS Chelsea and be able to enjoy the show after it has closed its gates to the public.’

Titchmarsh’s 1,600 sq ft display will feature a drystone wall, moorland complete with heather, birch and pine trees and a stream in its Yorkshire section.

And there will be a beach hut and plants like sea kale that are native to the British seaside in the garden’s coastal element.

Titchmarsh has described actually creating a garden rather than presenting as the ‘ultimate challenge’.

But he has been helped by award-winning professional garden designer Kate Gould and does not face any potential embarrassment by being judged.

Since his is a special display commissioned by the RHS, of which Titchmarsh is vice president, his garden will not be formally judged.

He said: ‘I’m rather relieved in a way that I’m not having to compete for gold if I’m absolutely honest.

‘But it’s the people who judge it really.

‘So I’m determined to build a garden that makes people say ‘oh my goodness, look at that’. That’s the important thing.

‘I’ve got to show I can do it now as well as present it.’

Designer Cleve West, 54, is favourite to make it a hattrick of ‘Best in Show’ awards with his Persian paradise-themed garden for investment house M & G after triumphing two years running.

His 2013 winning design included stone sentinels holding up intricate iron gates that led onto an enormous 300-year-old mill head mounted on a wall.

Other show highlights will include two military charities parading World War I-themed gardens to mark the centenary of the war’s outbreak.

ABF The Soldiers’ Charity has a garden called ‘No Man’s Land’ created by award-winning designer Charlotte Rowe.

Help for Heroes, meanwhile, has a ‘Hope on the Horizon’ garden in the shape of the Military Cross - the decoration for extreme bravery awarded since 1914 - by designer Matthew Keightley.

At just 23, David Rich, is Chelsea’s youngest ever professional designer of a show garden.

He and brother Harry Rich, 26, are creating ‘Vital Earth The Night Sky garden’ for Irish utility firm Bord na Mona.

The Welsh brothers’ garden will boast features resembling stars, fallen meteors and black holes and a spiral staircase will lead to a rooftop for viewing of the night sky.

Gucci is relying on designer Sarah Eberle to fashion a gem of a garden.

It features a mini catwalk and hanging bouquets suspended by chains made to look like Gucci jewellery.

Former RHS Young Garden Designer of the Year Hugo Bugg, 26, is designing for the Royal Bank of Canada.

Other competing designers include Matthew Childs (for Brewin Dolphin), Luciano Giubbilei (Laurent Perrier), Adam Frost (Homebase) and Andrew Wilson (Cloudy Bay).

Last year, Prince Harry made his first visit to Chelsea to see the garden that his Sentebale charity, which supports vulnerable African children in Lesotho, created for the show.

The garden, boasting native Lesotho flowers and a pavilion based on a traditional Basotho roundhouse, was designed for him by Jinny Blom and won a silver medal.

The Queen is expected to make her 50th visit to the show this year.
