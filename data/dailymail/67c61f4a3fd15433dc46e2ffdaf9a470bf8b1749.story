Doing time: Former Mount St. Mary Academy teacher Kelly O'Rourke, 42, has been jailed for 10 years for contacting her female sexual assault victim

A former teacher has been jailed for 10 years for ignoring a court order not to contact a teenager she had a yearlong affair with.

Kelly O'Rourke, 42, was told to have no contact with her victim after pleading guilty in January to a charge of sexual assault.

She was given a 15-year sentence but told she would only serve 120 days.

One of the conditions of her plea deal was that the volleyball coach did not have any further contact with her teenage victim, according to Arkansas Matters.

But while in prison O'Rourke repeatedly telephoned the girl more than 50 times.

All the calls recorded by prison staff and were played for Pulaski County Circuit Judge Barry Sims who had presided over her original trial earlier in the year.

He told O'Rourke that he had to come down 'pretty hard' on her because she had called the girl repeatedly since her initial sentencing.

'You had no intention of following these orders,' Sims told O'Rourke.

Sims said he listened to recordings of calls O'Rourke made to the girl from jail and said she was being disrespectful toward the court.

O'Rourke admitted making the calls when she appeared before Judge Pulaski at a court in Little Rock, Arkansas.

In one she told the victim she wanted her 'in her life' as her girlfriend.

This is Mount St. Mary Academy in Little Rock where Kelly O'Rourke met her victim

Room mate: The school's athletic director Kathy Griffin was also suspended as she failed to tell staff about the affair. She also lived with O'Rourke

'I
am remorseful, ashamed and regret my behavior in disrespecting the 
court's orders,' she said before being sentenced to 10 years.

O'Rourke began the affair with a 16 year old student in 2010 while teaching at Mount St. Mary Academy in Little Rock.

After school officials were tipped off about the affair O'Rourke was suspended. The affair ended in 2011 when the girl graduated from school.

The school's athletic director Kathy Griffin was also suspended as she failed to tell staff about the affair.

O'Rourke and Griffin lived together.

Griffin was sentenced to a year of probation after being convicted last month of failing to report the relationship.

The victim was 16 when the abuse began in 2010 and graduated from high school the next year at age 17.

She is now an adult and Sims lifted the no-contact order.

As part of the original sentence O'Rourke has had to register as a sex offender, provide a sample of her DNA and pay $5,000 in court costs.

She was also obligated to testify against Griffin.
