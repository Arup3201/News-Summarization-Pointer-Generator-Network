The madness that is London Fashion Week has just left the Capital. We've not even hit Summer and yet we're already being told what to wear come Autumn.

But at astylealbum.com we love a fashion fix and London Fashion Week gave us exactly that. We can't help but get excited for what the best of British Fashion has to offer.

Erdem, Christopher Kane and Antonio Berardi were high lights for us. All playing with colour and texture, using rich colours - deep purple, burnt orange and vibrant reds.

Preen combined a multitude of colours for their collection resulting in a bright, boho vibe. 

Temperley also stayed true to their bohemian roots, creating a nomad-themed collection. 

Of course the catwalk looks are not easy to recreate head to toe. 

Take from the shows snippets of what you love, use the catwalk for inspiration and ideas to carry over into your own wardrobe. 

Louise loved the bright, bold colours being showcased by Christopher Kane on the catwalk

We loved Temperley London's grey and yellow colour palette; Erdems textured opulent skirts teamed with soft knits and Preens cool mix of folklore prints layered with lumberjack coats. 

Thanks to high demand these looks tend to filter through from catwalk to high street in as little as three weeks, so those of us who don't have a bottomless budget can achieve a designer finish. 

A Style Album get just as excited for the street style images as the catwalk. 

Antonio Berardi's show was another picked out by A Style Album for its vibrancy and textures

Street Style is a massive part of Fashion month with Street Style photographers heading to the four Fashion Capitals to cover outside the shows. 

Favourite looks from London for us were Laura & Petro of wardrobe icons.com. We love Petro's bright yellow oversized coat from new label Raey, available at matchesfashion.com. 

And Laura, matching her lipstick with her Valentino clutch a great combination set of by her cream Alice & Olivia coat.

And top marks for the stylish lady in the Isabel Marant patchwork coat worn over a neutral colour palette.

We got the Style Album team together to take in the atmosphere during London Fashion Week. We stayed at the luxurious Rosewood Hotel, which was great for it's close proximity to Somerset house, the hub of London Fashion Week.

It was a real treat to take in some shows and also check out the upcoming designers showcasing their collections at Somerset house.

We popped by the Aspinal x Etre Cecile collaboration showcasing at the Saville Club and fell in love with the stunning collection of cool bags and accessories. 

It was a hectic but enjoyable few days, if a little stressful deciding on outfits! Trying to look smart, stay comfy and practical all while it's pouring down with rain isn't as easy as Tommy Ton's street style stars make it look.

We chose a mix of British high street and designer pieces for our London Fashion week looks, head to astylealbum.com to shop the looks.
