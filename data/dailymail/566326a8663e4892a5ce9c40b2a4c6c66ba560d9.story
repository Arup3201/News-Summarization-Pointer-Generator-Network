Stewart Marshall was jailed for eight years at Bradford Crown Court after targeting elderly, disabled and blind victims

A heartless conman scoured neighbourhoods for the most elderly and vulnerable people so that he could fleece them of their savings and valuables, a court heard.

Stewart Marshall kept notes of the names and addresses of targets alongside descriptions such as ‘nutty old bat’, ‘Mrs disabled’ and ‘Mr has Alzheimer’s’.

Posing as a builder, he offered them home improvement work that was either not done at all or carried out to a poor standard.

The victims, who had an average age of around 90, handed over thousands of pounds while one woman was persuaded to give up her wedding, engagement and eternity rings.

Marshall was jailed for eight years at Bradford Crown Court after being branded ‘mean, selfish and greedy’ by the judge.

He was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to burgle over a two-year period and converting criminal property. The court heard Marshall, of Wyke, Bradford, went cold-calling with his ‘conman’s kit’ of bogus identification cards and badges.

He scouted residential areas for the easiest prey and tricked his way into the homes of very elderly people with dementia, mobility problems and blindness.

Marshall, 44, pretended to be a builder, but in reality was a cruel conman and heroin addict who used much of the cash to buy drugs.

Judge John Potter said Marshall primarily ‘extorted’ money from victims.

The first victim was Maurice Lobley, 81, who suffered from dementia and was targeted weeks before his death in September 2011.

He paid £15,000 for building work on a driveway and £7,000 for a single window.

Widow Joan Cottam, 90, issued eight cheques worth more than £11,000 to replace windows that did not need any work.

Mrs Cottam said that a man involved in the work persuaded her to hand over her wedding, engagement and eternity rings.

Marshall stole the jewellery of another victim, Amy Roper, 94, who is partially blind and disabled, while he pretended to check a water leak.

Judge John Potter told Marshall: 'This was mean, selfish offending inspired by greed,' as he sentenced him to a stint behind bars at Bradford Crown Court, pictured

Frank Perkins, 66, who is wheelchair-bound, had a wallet containing £115 stolen.

In
 June this year Marshall was put under surveillance by police. He 
visited an 89-year-old partially-sighted woman who gave him £30 to tidy 
her garden, only for officers to film him rolling tin foil ‘consistent 
with a drug addict getting a fix’.

Passing
 sentence, Judge Potter said Marshall had not shown a ‘shred of remorse’
 and added: ‘The premises were targeted on the basis of their occupants 
being vulnerable or elderly and all were in their homes when you stole 
from them.

'This was mean, selfish offending inspired by greed.’

After
 the case Mr Lobley’s son David said: ‘I hope his sentence acts as a 
deterrent to others who might be thinking of attempting the same thing. 
There is no place in society for people like that and I am glad he has 
been taken out of it.’

Detective
 Constable Sean Donoghue urged people to only allow doorstep callers 
into their property if they are sure of their identity.
