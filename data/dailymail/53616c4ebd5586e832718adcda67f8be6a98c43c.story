A woman has endured painful laser surgery to be rid of a giant tattoo she had emblazoned across her stomach.

Cher, 31, from Glasgow, had a skull and angel wings etched onto her skin in her twenties when she was struggling to fit in with the gay community.

'Growing up I was really girly, I would buy dresses and skirts. I knew I was gay and I thought I had to change to fit in,' she explains on Channel 4 show Bodyshockers. 'I felt like a lost girl in a gay bar with long hair, heels and a dress. Everyone else had short hair, piercings and tattoos.'

The 31-year-old admits the tattoo looks like something a biker mad Hell's Angels fan would have 

The financial adviser chose the 'manly' skull surrounded by wings in her bid to look more butch.

But ten years later, she says the gay community has moved on and she no longer feels she has to conform to a stereotypical image.

She said: 'When I came out I tried to fit in to the gay community by getting my hair cut short and getting piercings and tattoos.

'Now I'm more girly again, it doesn't suit me. I'm back to being comfortable in myself. The tattoo is embarrassing, it's massive. Every time I see it gets me down. As soon as it's gone I'll feel like me again.'

Cher said the laser removal surgery was agony and 'worse than getting a tattoo'

Her girlfriend agrees that the tattoo doesn't suit her, comparing it to something a biker mad Hell's Angel fan might have. 

Cher said: 'I can't stand it, I hate it, I wish I never got it.'

She was given the chance to turn back the clock by having laser removal surgery as the Bodyshockers cameras rolled.

Cher is seen struggling to deal with the pain and admits: 'This is worse than getting a tattoo, it's agony. It feels like someone has a frying pan on my stomach and is frying sausages.' 

It will take six sessions for the tattoo to be completely removed but Cher's chance of success are enhanced by the fact her only has black lines. Tattoos with colours are more difficult to remove with laser surgery. 

Cher said she definitely won't be getting any more tattoos in the future and she hopes other young people will take heed from her story and think before they ink.  

Bodyshockers is on Channel 4 Wednesdays at 10pm
