Barack Obama last night told elated supporters that the inauguration was a time to celebrate 'our incredible nation' as he kissed wife Michelle after being sworn in for his second term.

The first couple attended a glitzy reception in Washington D.C. on Sunday night with Vice-President Joe Biden and wife Jill, just hours ahead of Obama's second inauguration on Monday morning.

Crowds are already swelling outside the Capitol building, yet officials said they expect only 500,000 to 700,000 people to attend - around one million fewer than at Obama's first inauguration in 2009.

Glittering event: President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle arrive to speak to supporters and donors at a reception for the 57th Presidential Inauguration at The National Building Museum in Washington tonight

On Sunday night, the Obamas attended 
the event at the National Building Museum to celebrate those who 
supported the campaign and benefactors of the Presidential Inaugural 
Committee.

Michelle looked glamorous in a sequined,
black cocktail dress and statement earrings while Dr Biden wore a navy 
blue dress with a bold necklace.

Obama thanked his many donors for their support at the event and said his second inauguration is a celebration of the country and its citizens, not the election results.

He reminded the crowd that 'what we're doing is celebrating each other and celebrating this incredible nation that we call home'.

He encouraged the crowd to enjoy the inauguration and said he needs them to work as hard as they can on issues important to them.

Obama said the inauguration is a reminder that 'there is something bigger than ourselves'.

He kept his comments brief and quipped
that he has to save some of his lines for his speech on Monday. He also
gave his opinion on a much-debated matter his week - his wife's new 
haircut.

He said: 'I love her bangs. She looks good. She always looks good.'

First lady Michelle Obama unveiled her new haircut in a White House photo released last Thursday for her 49th birthday.

Obama was sworn in for four 
more years earlier on Sunday in a simple ceremony at the White House, 
embarking on a second-term quest to restore a still-shaky economy and 
combat terrorists overseas while swearing an age-old oath to 'preserve, 
protect and defend' the Constitution.

'I did it,' a smiling president said to his daughter Sasha seconds after following Chief Justice John Roberts in reciting the oath of office. First Lady Michelle and the couple's other daughter, Malia, were among relatives who bore witness.

The quiet moments were prelude to today's public inaugural events when Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will be sworn in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol before a television audience counted in the millions.

The trappings are in place - the flag-draped stands ready outside the Capitol and the tables set inside for a traditional lunch with lawmakers. Across town, a specially made reviewing stand rested outside the White House gates for the president and guests to watch the traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue.

The
weather forecast is encouraging as high temperatures are predicted for the lower 40s during the day, with scattered snow showers 
during the evening, when two inaugural balls will conclude the official 
proceedings.

The 44th chief
executive is only the 17th to win re-election, and his second-term 
goals are ambitious for a country where sharp political differences have
produced gridlocked government in recent years.

Restoration of the economy to full strength and pressing the worldwide campaign against terrorists sit atop the agenda. He also wants to reduce federal deficits and win immigration and gun control legislation from Congress, where Republicans control the House.

If he needed a reminder of the challenges he faces, he got one from half-way around the globe. An Algerian security official disclosed the discovery of 25 additional bodies at a gas plant where radical Islamists last week took dozens of foreign workers hostage.

In Washington on Sunday, tourists strolled leisurely on an unseasonably warm day.

'I'm very proud of him and what he's 
trying to do for immigration, women's rights, what they call Obamacare 
and concerns for the middle class,' said Patricia Merritt, a retired 
educator from San Antonio, in town with her daughter and granddaughter 
to see the inauguration and parade.

'I think he's more disrespected than any other president,' she added, referring to his critics.

Sean
Payton, an operations analyst from Highland Ranch, Colorado, said he 
hoped to hear 'a nice eloquent speech that makes people feel good about 
being an American'.

Republicans lent a touch of bipartisanship to the weekend.

'We always want any president to succeed, to do well, that means America does well and Americans do well,' Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming said on CNN's State of the Union.

Obama took the oath in the White House Blue Room where portraits of Presidents John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and John Tyler grace the walls. He placed a hand on a Bible held by his wife. His daughters stood nearby.

The nation's political divisions 
seemed scarcely to intrude as Obama, a Democrat, shook hands with 
Roberts, a Republican appointee, in a rite that renews American 
democracy every four years. Unlike four years ago, when Roberts stumbled
verbally, the chief justice recited the oath without error.

Before
the swearing-in, the president listened from a second-row pew at the 
175-year-old Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church as the Rev.
Jonathan V. Newman asked God's blessing for the him and his family. 
'But also prepare him for battle ... because sometimes enemies insist on
doing it the hard way,' he said.

Close bond: Mr Obama got a happy hug from older daughter Malia and Sasha (right) told him 'Good job, Daddy!' after he completed the oath. 'You didn't mess up!'

All smiles: Though they looked serious during the actual ceremony, everyone appeared happy after it was done

Few fans: Only a handful of relatives were invited to attend the private ceremony

Like Obama, Biden began his day early on Sunday. He attended Catholic Mass at his official residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory a few miles from the White House.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic justice and an Obama appointee, administered the oath of office.

Biden joined Obama at the cemetery, where the two men placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns and observed a moment of silence as a bugler sounded Taps.
