The BBC has suspended a Panorama employee and dropped an episode of the programme after a producer was accused of trying to bribe a security consultant for information.

The episode of the flagship documentary was due to air on Monday and was described by The Radio Times as ‘an investigation into financial scandals that could wipe out people’s life savings, including a £250 million Caribbean rental-home development scheme’.

The programme looked into the activities of Harlequin Property, a developer of Caribbean luxury homes, but BBC bosses decided to pull it last Thursday after the firm complained of the ‘shocking’ approach, The Times reported.

It is alleged Panorama producer Matthew Chapman suggested the property company Mr Ghent was contracted to work for couldn’t pay its bills and offered him the ‘cheeky’ possibility of work with the BBC in exchange for inside information, it is claimed.

Mr Chapman allegedly wrote in the email he ‘may be able to put things your way’ for information, and signed off: 'It’s always good to keep one eye on the future!’

But the property company said the approach was ‘tantamount to a bribe’.

Mr Ghent told The Times that he received an email two weeks ago from Matthew Chapman, who described himself as an award-winning Panorama producer doing a programme partly on Harlequin.

The email said: ‘I was wondering if I could be a bit cheeky here.

‘It’s unlikely that Ames [Harlequin’s chairman David Ames] and maybe Harlequin will be around for much longer, nor will he have money to pay people for much longer.

‘There are [sic] a long list of creditors already I understand. 

‘Panorama and the BBC is [sic] always using security and protection officers and although I cannot guarantee anything we may be able to put things your way.

A letter from Harlequin to the BBC said: 'In short, it appears to be tantamount to an attempted bribe'

‘Or we could work together on stories. It’s always good to keep one eye on the future! How would you feel helping me out in a totally confidential way.’

Mr Ghent said that he was shocked by the producer’s approach to him via the LinkedIn website on March 13.

He said:‘He was suggesting my job might disappear. It seemed to me he was trying to offer me an enticement.’

Harlequin complained to the BBC last Wednesday and the next day the programme was removed from the schedule.

In a letter to the BBC’s litigation department Harlequin described Mr Chapman’s approach as ‘simply staggering’ and ‘tantamount to an attempted bribe.’

‘Panorama and the BBC is [sic] always using security and protection officers and although I cannot guarantee anything we may be able to put things your way.

‘Or we could work together on stories. It’s always good to keep one eye on the future! How would you feel helping me out in a totally confidential way.’

The letter said: ‘On any sensible interpretation, the message to Mr Ghent is simply staggering.

‘It appears to constitute a flagrant and in our view highly improper attempt by [the journalist] to induce Mr Ghent into disclosing information about Harlequin in return for the potential reward of future work from the BBC.

‘In short, it appears to be tantamount to an attempted bribe.’

The BBC said yesterday that it had suspended a member of the Panorama team and started disciplinary proceedings.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘In light of information received late in the production process of this film the BBC decided to postpone broadcast.

‘We are currently reviewing the facts. As a result a member of the team has been suspended and a disciplinary procedure is under way.’

The Corporation’s anti-bribery policy states: ‘The BBC takes a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption and is committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all its business dealings and relationships wherever it operates.’

The Serious Fraud Office and Essex Police are looking into complaints in relation to Harlequin and have appealed for information from anyone who has invested in the company.

Thousands of people invested up to £300 million into Harlequin schemes and hundreds have been left without payments due from the company.

Some claimed that they were misadvised by external advisers about the risks of transferring pension funds into schemes which they now fear may never materialise.

There is no suggestion Harlequin is unable to meet its obligations.
