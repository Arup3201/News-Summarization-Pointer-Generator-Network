Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, the former army chief, won last week's Egyptian elections with a landslide 96.9 per cent of the vote, officials announced today.

Firework celebrations broke out among his supporters as figures released by Egypt's Election Commission confirmed Sisi would become Egypt's next president, despite a disappointingly low turnout of just 47.5 per cent.

Anwar el-Assi, the Election Commission's president, said the former field marshal received 23.78million votes. His sole rival, leftist politician Hamdeen Sabahi, got 3 per cent of the vote.

After the announcement, several thousand people who were gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square set off fireworks, cheered and sang pro-military songs.

Sisi's victory was never in doubt, but the career infantry officer had pushed for a massive turnout to give legitimacy to the coup he led last July to overthrow former president Mohammed Morsi.

The ensuing crackdown on Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood effectively outlawed Egypt's main opposition party.

Some of Sisi's critics have argued that the turnout figure had been inflated after many polling stations appeared to remain largely empty throughout last week's election.

The lack of participation was despite authorities threats that non-voters could face large fines, the introduction of a last-minute public holiday and the extension of polling to a third day.

Morsi was elected in 2012 in an internationally supervised election that drew 52 per cent of Egypt's voters to the polls, but lasted less than a year in office until demonstrations prompted the military to remove him from power.

The Muslim Brotherhood, which now 
operates in exile, denounced Sisi's election as a 'sham' and claimed 90 
per cent of Egyptians boycotted the poll.

'The
 Egyptian people have dealt a serious and humiliating blow to the 
illegitimate coup and its so-called roadmap,' the group said in a 
statement. 'This is the beginning of the end of the military coup. We 
hail the Egyptian People's resilience and steadfastness.

'The
 Egyptian people have turned their back to the sham presidential 
elections. All the military coup's begging, pleas and threats have 
failed. The Egyptian people have thus told the whole world that they 
will not abandon democratic legitimacy, freedom or dignity.'

Army man Sisi now faces a challenge 
taking control of a country where street demonstrations have helped to 
topple two leaders on only three years.

The
 lower-than-expected turnout raises questions about Sisi's legitimacy as
 he attempts to fix a battered economy, ease poverty and head off 
further political crises.

For
 now, Sisi's supporters seemed content to celebrate the moment, 
gathering by the thousands in Cairo's Tahrir Square, the symbolic heart 
of the uprising that ousted army-backed autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011.

Fireworks
 could be heard downtown and in other parts of the capital, which has 
witnessed frequent street violence since security forces began a 
relentless crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood after Morsi's fall.

Hundreds
 of Morsi supporters have been killed and thousands arrested. The 
movement's top leader has been sentenced to death and other prominent 
figures could face a similar fate.

Although
 Egyptians had high hopes of genuine democracy when Mubarak was toppled 
after 30 years in power, what some seem to crave now more than anything 
is calm.

Shopkeeper Refat 
Ahmed, 30, told Reuters: 'For now, I think it is OK to compromise on 
freedoms for the sake of stability and security. What good will freedom 
without security bring us?'

Critics view Sisi as another dictator who, like Mubarak, will protect the interests of the military and crush dissent.

Human
 rights groups say abuses have spread since Morsi's downfall, with 
opponents of Sisi's military regime thrown in jail and tortured. 
Authorities deny that abuses occur.

Last week, Amnesty International said 
Egypt was likely to continue to face a 'downward spiral of human rights 
abuses' after the presidential poll.

'This
 election will not wipe the slate clean after 10 months of gross human 
rights violations,' said Hassiba Hadj- Sahraoui, Deputy Director for the
 Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.

'The country’s partners, such as the USA and the European Union, should not use the elections as a cover to return to ‘business as usual’ with Egypt.

'Instead, there must be an acknowledgement of the scale and seriousness of the human rights violations committed in the last 10 months.'

Shortly after the election result was announced, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah announced a donor conference for a country that the world's top oil exporter sees as a frontline ally.

Saudi has been a main supporter of Sisi and the military government. King Abdullah said any country that did not contribute to Egypt's future despite having the ability to do so would 'have no future place among us'.
