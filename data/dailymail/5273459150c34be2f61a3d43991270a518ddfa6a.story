Cardiff's South Korean midfielder Kim Bo-kyung and agents Carly Barnes and Phil Smith were all allegedly discussed in the text message exchange between Malky Mackay and Iain Moody.

Sportsmail’s investigation into allegations of racist, sexist and homophobic texts ended on Thursday night with a public apology from Malky Mackay and the resignation of Crystal Palace sporting director Iain Moody.

The text exchanges outlined in Sportsmail’s exclusive report date back to when Mackay and Moody worked as manager and head of recruitment at Cardiff City, before both were sacked by club owner Vincent Tan amid claims of over-spending in the transfer market.

Tan launched a £750,000 investigation, conducted by law firm Mishcon de Reya. The series of deeply offensive text messages were discovered during a raid on Moody’s London home in March.

After a meeting his employers at Selhurst Park, Moody resigned on Thursday.

Mackay issued a poorly worded statement through the League Managers’ Association. ‘In the course of a search by the club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one-line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures,’ said the statement.

WHAT WAS SAID: ‘I hope she’s looking after your needs. I bet you’d love a bounce on her falsies.’ 

THE RESPONSE: Carly Barnes was unavailable for comment on Thursday.

Victim: Agent Carly Barnes was discussed in text messages allegedly sent on Iain Moody's phone

PHIL SMITH - AGENT

WHAT WAS SAID: ‘Go on, fat Phil. Nothing like a Jew that sees money slipping through his fingers!!!’

THE RESPONSE: ‘It was unnecessary. Agents can be fair game. I understand that. But it’s offensive. In today’s society racism is wholly unacceptable and sport should be no different. It’s part of our society and it should set an example.

‘I don’t know if there was any malice but people have to be more aware and more responsible. As a Jewish person - and with what is going on in Europe at the moment the Jewish community is feeling pretty vulnerable - this kind of thing doesn’t help. We all support anti-racism in sport and now that I have been asked to say something I’m going to take the opportunity.

‘If you want to call me fat, I don’t care. But to say it’s good to see a Jew suffer, that’s not good.

‘I don’t want to be judgmental because I think they have enough problems but this isn’t just football - it’s real life - and there is no place for language like that.’

KIM BO-KYUNG - CARDIFF CITY MIDFIELDER 

WHAT WAS SAID: ‘Fkn chinkys.’

‘Fk it. There’s enough dogs in Cardiff for us all to go around.’

THE RESPONSE: Kim's agent Lee Yeung-Joong responded via email.

'Surely, we have checked all reports from the UK regarding the manager Mackay and his right hand man Iain Moody related with our player Kim Bo-Kyung.

'Regardless Mackay had mentioned that kind of Racist words by text, we never received any unfair treatments from him and Cardiff City football club at all.

'When Kim firstly joined Cardiff in 2012 summer, just after London Olympic, Mackay had given a lot of considerations for the player and our staffs.

'Kim couldn’t understand English well at that time, and our staff could be always with the player and support him very well, at all home, away games, locker room and all of team meetings, even it was not allowed to anyone. Also, Mackay had spent a lot of times with Kim for his adaptation and match performances always.

'Mackay has very strong character, as everyone knows, and he could say worst words on the pitch, but it was just a WORD, and he always has shown warmest hearts and faith to the player and all of our agency staffs as well.

'This is all what I can tell you about this rumor.'

The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC.

In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete.

The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise.

Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC.

Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter.

Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others.

Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.
