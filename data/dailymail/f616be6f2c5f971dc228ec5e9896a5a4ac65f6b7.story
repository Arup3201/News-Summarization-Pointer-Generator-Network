MPs were facing a new backlash over expenses last night after it emerged they have been making claims for designer spectacles worth hundreds of pounds.

Former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, along with Government and Shadow Ministers, are among those who have made claims for glasses at the taxpayers’ expense.

One MP even submitted a receipt for a pair worth £354. More than two dozen MPs have made claims for spectacles over the past four years, totalling more than £5,400.

The politicians made the claims on behalf of their staff, in line with Revenue & Customs guidance, which states that employers should make a contribution towards the cost of spectacles where their employees use computer screens.

But one Tory MP, Glyn Davies, submitted receipts for his own glasses. The Welsh MP made five claims, totalling £370. Last night he said: ‘Two are mine and the other three are for staff. I think it’s fair.’

The claims, logged with the Independent Parliament Standards Authority (IPSA), show MPs are regularly reimbursed for staff spectacles worth more than £100. Specsavers’ cheapest pair, including frames and lenses, cost just £25.

The Mail on Sunday revealed last week that politicians were claiming for cycling mileage.

Last night, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, Jonathan Isaby, said: ‘It’s totally unacceptable that anyone is demanding the unwitting taxpayer pay for designer frames.’

Mr Lansley, who was sacked as Health Secretary in 2012 and is now Leader of the House of Commons, claimed £229 for ‘prescription glasses and eye test costs’ for an employee last year.

Communities and Local Government Minister Stephen Williams, who sits on the expenses committee, claimed £319.50 and Shadow Health Minister Jamie Reed made one claim worth £165.

Conservative MP Fiona Bruce claimed the most, submitting receipts for £629. She said: ‘My overall expense claims are very  low, but I take staff welfare issues very seriously.’

But Tory MP James Duddridge, who claimed £354, said: ‘This isn’t an employee buying an expensive frame, it’s a complex prescription which costs a lot of money.’

Labour MP Alan Whitehead, who made claims of £224 and £207,  said: ‘There is nothing wrong whatsoever with those claims.

‘I personally take my staff’s welfare reasonably seriously.’

Tory MP Nick de Bois, who made claims for £200 and £119, said: ‘Two of my staff suffered eye problems as a result of jobs which involve a lot of computer use. I didn’t think it fair to make them pay for the right lenses and frames for this. I won’t ever cut corners with the wellbeing of my employees.’

When asked if staff should have chosen cheaper models, Labour MP Roger Godsiff, who claimed £138.70 and £129, said: ‘IPSA run a very tight regime and they lay down the guidelines.

‘I suppose you could still go and get an original pair of NHS spectacles with the wire issued in 1948.  I suppose that’s possible.’
