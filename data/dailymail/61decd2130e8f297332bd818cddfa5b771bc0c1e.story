When teachers try to be 'down' with the kids, the results are, more often than not, disastrous.

But staff at Indian Hill Elementary in Round Lake Heights, Illinois, have somehow managed to buck the trend by recording an hilarious version of the hit tune 'I'm So Sexy'.

The school’s assistant principal, Sandy Kennedy, had asked them to come up with creative ways to get students excited about taking-tests.

Routine: Teacher Corey Hendricks leads staff at Indian Hill Elementary in Round Lake Heights, Illinois, in a merry dance to his version of the song sexy and I know it

So one of the teachers, Corey Hendricks, decided the best way to improve grades would be if they   dispensed with any dignity, dressed up in a crazy wigs and 80s clothes and were filmed dancing through the halls to a specially recorded version of the LMFAO hit.

Hendricks first downloaded an instrumental track of the song and rewrote the lyrics for his version entitled: 'I'm a smarty and I know it.'

The video was shown to pupils on a big screen during a surprise assembly and proved a massive hit.

Hendricks said: 'The kids just went nuts.'

'Kids get stressed about taking tests. The students see teachers having a good time and showing a positive message.

'It’s a fun parody with the intent to 
have the kids excited about taking the ISAT’s,' said Henry Campos, who 
has two children at the school.

Popular choice: The song has already been covered by Jimmy Fallon, Bruce Springsteen, Nicholas Cage and the cast of Glee

It's not the first time the song has been chosen as a comedy cover.

Earlier this week comedian Jimmy Fallon dressed as Neil Young and was joined by Bruce Springsteen dressed in his 80s gear to perform it on his chat show.

The cast of Glee performed a memorable version and even actor Nicholas Cage had a go at singing it on Britain's Capital FM radio.
