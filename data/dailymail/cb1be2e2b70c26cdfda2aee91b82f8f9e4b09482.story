Most
 of the debate leading up to England's showdown with Uruguay has been 
about Wayne Rooney and where he should play or if at all.

That
 big debate has disguised the fact that England skipper Steven Gerrard 
was far from a commanding figure against Italy and he certainly didn't 
pull any strings in his new quarter back role in comparison to Andrea 
Pirlo for Italy.

But in Gerrard's defence he did hold his position and thus helped England keep their shape for most of the game.

Against
 Uruguay though Gerrard must impose himself more. If not then Roy 
Hodgson must not be afraid to sub his captain and put on Frank Lampard. 
Otherwise what was the point in picking the former Chelsea man in the 
first place?

One aspect of England's opening game defeat to Italy was the sporting spirit which it was played in with the sole yellow card falling to Raheem Sterling late on for a blatant 'technical foul'.

Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers deserves much credit for how he allowed the game to flow but it could be another story in the Three Lions' clash against Uruguay on Thursday.

Spanish referee Carlos Carballo has a reputation of being an over-fussy official who at one stage of his career averaged six yellow cards a game.

He is now a bit less trigger happy but in the Euro 2012 opener between Poland and Greece heÂ  issued two red cards.

It's interesting to note that while Sterling was the stand out player against Italy, covering 6.52 miles, two England players travelled further in the match.

Wayne Rooney clocked up 6.97 miles while Gerrard covered 6.58 - which just goes to show why that kind of stat is often meaningless.

While Roy Hodgson looks set to tinker with his system against Uruguay, if not personnel, Holland boss Louis van Gaal is revealing to Manchester United fans one his great strengths as a coach ahead of next season.

The 62-year-old has a well thought-out plan and team in his mind and he sticks to it.

Holland named the same starting line-up for their first two World Cup Group B wins, against Spain and Australia, with the starting eleven numbered 1-11 - making them the only the nation to have done that so far. Talk about having a plan.

It also suggests Van Gaal won't succumb to Wayne Rooney deciding where he wants to play at Old Trafford.

The have been some truly stunning goals at the his World Cup but precious few long range scorchers.

Holland's late winner struck by Memphis Depay, whose name sounds like a Blues singer, was a rarity.

Thus far only 13 per cent of goals have been stuck from more than 20 yards.

Look Out For

If you can manage to carry on after the England match then Japan's Keisuke Honda is a player to keep an eye out for.

The AC Milan midfielder scored a super goal and oozed class in Japan's 2-1 defeat to the Ivory Coast but they should bounce back against Greece if Honda produces similar form.

World Cup Bet

The bookies make Daniel Sturridge a slight favourite to draw first blood in the SAS showdown at 5-1 to score the opening goal while Luis Suarez is 6-1.

This might sound a bit left field but I just fancy Leighton Baines, who got unfair stick after the Italy game, at 22-1.

If England get an early free kick in his 'zone' then it could happen.

Brazil remain 7-2 favourites to win the tournament but Holland have been cut to 11-1. Could this at long last but an Oranje summer?

Worth a punt? Daniel Sturridge is the bookies favourites to score first in England's clash against Uruguay

World Cup Memory

It became one of the most tragic episodes in football history. Much fancied Columbia flopped at the 1994 World Cup finals not least because of the influence drug cartels and betting syndicates around the squad.

They were knocked out when defender Andres Escobar scored an own goal in defeat to the USA.

A few days later having returned home to Medellin, Escobar was shot dead outside a bar after a row with some gangsters.

If Gerrard fails to deliver Roy Hodgson should sub him for Frank Lampard
