Speaking out: Whitey Bulger has revealed he will not be testifying in his trial as he believes it's a sham

James 'Whitey' Bulger today revealed that he will not be testifying in his own defense as his racketeering trial was a 'sham', and told the court: 'Do what yous want with me.'

It came as he dramatically agreed to give more than $800,000 that was found stashed in his 
Santa Monica apartment to the families of some of his alleged victims.

Defense attorney J.W. Carney Jr. met with Bulger on Friday morning and returned to the courtroom to tell Judge Denise Casper that he had finished presenting witnesses.

Bulger then told the judge, without the jury present, that he had decided not to testify 'involuntarily'.

'I feel that I've been choked off 
from having an opportunity to give an adequate defense,' he said. 'As 
far as I'm concerned, I didn't get a fair trial. This is a sham.'

He railed about the judge's decision prohibiting his lawyers from using an immunity defense.

Bulger
has claimed he received immunity from a now-deceased federal 
prosecutor. Casper ruled before trial that that was not a legal defense 
to crimes including murder.

Bulger,
83, is on trial in a broad racketeering indictment that accuses him of 
participating in 19 murders in the 1970s and '80s as leader of the 
Winter Hill Gang. He has pleaded not guilty.

Payout: Bulger said he wants $800,000 seized from his apartment to go to the families of his victims, including Patricia Donahue (left), widow of Michael Donahue, and their son Tommy (right)

He
fled Boston in 1994 and was one of the nation's most wanted fugitives 
until he was captured in Santa Monica, California, in 2011.

His long-term girlfriend, Catherine Greig, was also arrested and is serving an eight-year jail term for helping him escape authorities.

Before the jury entered the 
courtroom on Friday, Carney said the mobster would be willing to surrender the 
$822,198 to the families of alleged victims Brian Halloran and Michael 
Donahue.

Prosecutor Brian Kelly said it has 
always been the intention of the government to give the case to victims'
families, but added that he wasn't sure if Bulger could choose who 
received the money.

The
Halloran and Donahue families had been awarded a combined $8.5 million 
in 2007 after a judge ruled the FBI was responsible for the deaths of 
the men, My Fox Boston reported.

But
the judgment was throw out in 2011 by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court after it 
found the lawsuits were filed after the statute of limitations had run 
out.

Old life: Earlier this week, Bulger's attorneys released photographs of him before his capture. Here, he poses with long-term girlfriend, Catherine Greig, during a vacation

Tommy Donahue, 
Michael Donahue's son, who has attended the trial since it began in 
June, became emotional as the announcement was made.

Halloran was a Bulger associate. Bulger 
is accused of fatally shooting him and Donahue, an innocent bystander 
who had offered Halloran a ride home that night in May 1982.

Other victims' families have had their lawsuits tossed before trial and some have won judgments against the government, but Carney specifically cited those whose judgments were thrown out by the 1st Circuit.

If he's convicted, Bulger would have to give up his assets anyway. It is routine for the government to seek forfeiture of assets acquired through illegal activities.
