Almost half of new mothers are now over 30 as record numbers of older women choose to start families.

And most of these women are married, in comparison with new mums in their 20s who are far more likely to be single or living with a partner.

Nearly 360,000 women in their 30s gave birth last year – 49 per cent of the total – and just under seven in ten were married, the Office for National Statistics said.

Changing times: The proportion of women having children aged under 25 has fallen sharply while over-35s has risen

Meanwhile 369,000 women under 30 gave 
birth but their family situations were less stable than their older 
counterparts on the whole, with almost two-thirds either cohabiting or 
single.

The average age of 
new mothers also hit a historic high of 29.8 years, up from 29.7 in 
2011. The figure has been rising since 1975, when a woman typically gave
 birth at 26.4 years.

Now 
the average age of motherhood is higher than it was during the 1930s and
 1940s, when it reached a peak of 29.3 years in 1944.

The
 Office for National Statistics said: ‘The overall rise since 1975 
reflects the increasing numbers of women who have been delaying 
childbearing to later ages.

‘Possible
 influences include increased participation in higher education, 
increased female participation in the labour force, the increasing 
importance of a career, the rising costs of childbearing, labour market 
uncertainty, housing factors and instability of partnerships.’ Overall, 
just over half – 53 per cent – of babies were born to married mothers.

Among
 mothers in their 30s, 69 per cent were married, while only 37 per cent 
of under-20s were married. This dropped to one in five among those aged 
between 20 and 25.

The ONS report suggests young mothers are 
increasingly likely to be less well-off and in relationships that are 
more likely to break down, while older mothers tend to be in stable 
relationships and have reliable incomes.

Previous
 studies have found cohabiting relationships typically break up within 
three years, often creating single-parent families. By contrast, 
families of married couples are more likely to stay together, and are on
 average wealthier, healthier, and the children benefit from a better 
education.

Author on the 
family Jill Kirby said: ‘There is a big divide opening up between 
better-off, better-educated women who wait until they are older and 
marry before having children, and younger and often poorer mothers who 
do not see marriage as a first step. They have children in more casual 
relationships.

‘We should be
 worried by this because it is clear from all the data that children 
whose parents are not married have a much higher risk of seeing their 
family break up.

‘We need reforms to encourage women to marry before they have children to give their children a better chance.’
