A jeering crowd in China urged a hostage-taker to kill himself after he let his victim go and held knives up to his own throat instead.

Gong Tseng, 30, had been holding his cousin Cui Meng, 29, hostage at knifepoint after a family dispute broke out in the city Chongqing, in southern China.

Police managed to persuade Tseng to release Meng after a two-hour standoff, but when he turned the knives on himself the crowd lost patience.

Gong Tseng, 30, got into a two-hour standoff with police while holding a knife to his cousin Cui Meng's throat

According to police the pair got into a family dispute before Tseng pulled a knife and took his cousin hostage

One spectator shouted: 'Come on, we're fed up with waiting,' while another added: 'Get on with it, we don't have all day.'

Tseng eventually dropped the knife and was arrested for taking a hostage and causing GBH.

Earlier Meng, who was dressed in white, could be seen making a frantic call from his mobile phone while he was being held.

'The man who seized me is my cousin and I was calling our grandfather to make him let me go,' he explained later. 

Police manged to persuade Tsen to let his cousin go, but he then held the knives up to his own throat

As officers convinced Tseng to give up the crowd began shouting 'get on with it' and 'we haven't got all day'

Suicide attempts in large Chinese cities are often seen as a nuisance because they are viewed as a display rather than a genuine attempt

Suicide rates in China were once among the highest in the world, but have been falling in recent years as wealth and access to education have increased.

However suicides in heavily populated urban areas are becoming increasingly common and are viewed as a frustration by many as they often lead to busy transport networks being closed.

The fact that many of are performed publicly and in dramatic fashion has also lead people to believe that many of them are stunts, rather than genuine attempts.

Officers eventually persuaded Tseng to give up and he was arrested for taking a hostage and GBH
