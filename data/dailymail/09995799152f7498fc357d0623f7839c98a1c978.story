A man has admitted killing two young girls in a random street shooting in 2008, as well as murdering his fiance three years later.

Kevin Sweat, 28, killed 13-year-old Taylor Paschal-Placker and 11-year-old Skyla Whitaker near the town of Weleetka in rural Oklahoma - but investigators had no idea he was involved at the time.

It wasn't until police questioned him years over the brutal 2011 murder of his 23-year-old fiance Ashley Taylor, that officers were able to link the crimes.

Yesterday Sweat entered guilty to all three first-degree murders after prosecutors dropped plans to seek the death penalty in return for the killer agreeing to waive his right to a jury trial.

Guilty: Kevin Sweat, 28, has admitted shooting dead 13-year-old Taylor Paschal-Placker and 11-year-old Skyla Whitaker in rural Oklahoma road in 2008, and also slitting his fiance Ashley Taylor's her throat three years later

Prosecutors said Sweat told an investigator during a videotaped interview that he shot the two girls because he thought they were 'monsters' coming at him.

Sweat was barely audible at yesterday's hearing as he responded to questions from the judge, who read a statement he signed acknowledging that the statements he made during the taped interview were accurate.

'We're finally going to get this off of our shoulders,' said his late fiance's mother, Faye Taylor.

Ashley's father, Michael Taylor, added that the acknowledgement of guilt was 'a big part of the healing process,' adding: 'It's a big relief knowing this is happening. You doubt it's ever going to happen.'

Peter Placker, the grandfather of Taylor Paschal-Placker, said he 'finally knows for sure' that Sweat was responsible for the deaths. But he noted: 'It's not over until he's sentenced.'

A sentencing hearing has not been set, but Sweat faces life without prison, either with or without parole.

Sweat's attorneys had argued that Sweat was not mentally competent when he waived his Miranda rights before participating in the videotaped interview.

But a judge agreed this year to allow prosecutors to use the video as evidence. The video had been played at previous hearings.

In the video, Sweat first tells Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation agent Kurt Titsworth he had nothing to do with the girls' deaths, saying "there would be no point to shooting kids."

But Sweat eventually said he shot what he said were "the demons" who approached him along a rural road where the girls' bullet-riddled bodies were found.

"I see demons, vampires ... monsters, demons, whatever. I do have some problems," Sweat said. "I was scared. ... They were still coming at me, so I shot them."

Taylor, his fiance√©, went missing in July 2011 after telling her parents she was eloping with Sweat. Investigators have said that Sweat claimed he and Taylor argued and she got out of the car after the pair left Okmulgee to be married.

The cases were ultimately connected after officers investigating her death found shell casings on Sweat's father's property that had markings that matched those found at the scene of the girls' 2008 slayings.
