Fast food giant McDonald's has been slammed by medical professionals for trialling a home delivery service in a Queensland town where one in four children are overweight.

Population growth in the Hervey Bay region was the main reason for McDonald’s choosing the location, but the community's growing waistlines was a strong argument not to deliver burgers and fries to resident’s front doorsteps, according to Australian Medical Association (AMA) Queensland president Dr Shaun Rudd.

This comes as AMA Queensland launched a campaign last week to highlight the obesity crisis facing regional and rural Queenslanders which revealed two out of three adults, and one in four children, are overweight or obese in Hervey Bay.

Hervey Bay’s population is also expanding with a growth in the area  - which located about three hours north of Brisbane - of 14, 556 people within a decade from 2001 to 2011.

Dr Rudd said it was sad that the fast food chain had chosen an already overweight population to have easier access to junk food.

‘These large corporations have a look where they're going to get the most bang for their buck and they choose places like that,’ Dr Rudd told the ABC.

‘I think unfortunately they'll sell more food and that means there's going to be more burgers and more fries eaten by the population there, and they are already extremely overweight.’

McDonald's Australia corporate communications manager Chris Grant said the company would look at extending the service, which will operate seven days a week adn has a minimum $25 order and a $4.95 delivery fee, once the trial ended.

Fraser Coast Mayor Gerard O'Connell said the trial would bring investment and employment opportunities to the area but urged residents to use their common sense.

‘If you don't do things in balance, if you rely on takeaway food being delivered to the door, don't exercise and don't keep a check on your health, that's a recipe for disaster,’ he said.

There are already two home delivery trials being tested in Sydney, one is starting in Melboune later this month and home delivery is also earmarked for Karratha in Western Australia.

Population growth in the Hervey Bay region was the main reason for the fast food chain to decide to run the trial seven days a week
