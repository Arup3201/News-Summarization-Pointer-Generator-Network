We’re used to seeing Rube Goldberg machines on a manageable scale, using small objects like balls and cups to over-engineer a simple task via a series of chain reactions.

But National Geographic UK have taken the classic device to a ridiculous scale in their latest promotional video.

A human loop-the-loop, giant dominoes, a sail-powered car and explosions are all used in the impressive contraption.

National Geographic UK has created a large Rube Goldberg Machine. The contraption begins with a simple Newton's Cradle (shown), but it quickly escalates to bigger and bigger designs

The video was created by National Geographic UK to promote their upcoming lineup of shows.

It used 9 globes, 3 tyres, a Volkswagen beetle, bowling balls and much more to make everything work together.

The finished article is a four-ton scientific contraption with 38 triggers and 71 moving pieces.

In the video Tim Shaw, host of the show Street Genius, sets everything in motion with a simple Newton’s Cradle.

This sets off larger and larger systems, with a particular highlight coming with a surprisingly giant set of dominoes.

Later a person is sent diving around a loop-the-loop into a target, before balls set off a series of mini-explosions and a bowling ball goes for a strike.

It culminates in a blast of fire around a hovering globe with the slogan: ‘Entertain your brain.’

This is promoting the science-based shows on the network, which include Street Genius, Science of Stupid and Brain Games.

Such machines are inspired by the famous American cartoonist Rube Goldberg (4 July 1883 to 7 December 1970).

He was best known for his popular cartoons depicting complicated gadgets performing simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways. 

Street Genius premieres at 6pm on Sunday 18 January 6pm on National Geographic Channel.

Rube Goldberg's cartoons became known for depicting over-elaborate devices that performed simple tasks in convoluted ways.

One example is 'Professor Butts and the Self-Operating Napkin' (above), which was later reprinted in the postcard book Rube Goldberg's Inventions.

The 'self-operating napkin' is activated when soup spoon (A) is raised to mouth, pulling string (B) and thereby jerking ladle (C), which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E). Parrot jumps after cracker and perch (F) tilts, upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H). Extra weight in pail pulls cord (I), which opens and lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K) which causes sickle (L) to cut string (M) and allow pendulum with attached napkin to swing back and forth, thereby wiping chin.

In 1931, the Merriam-Webster dictionary defined 'Rube Goldberg' as accomplishing something simple through complex means.
