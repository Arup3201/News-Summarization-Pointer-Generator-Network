A large New Jersey shore family that suffered losses during Superstorm Sandy will share a $20 million lottery jackpot that one of the 17 siblings said would be 'a great pick-me-up.'

Members of the Endreson family packed the Beachwood Community Center Thursday afternoon for a news conference. A lottery spokeswoman said the siblings range in age from 53 to 76.

The New Jersey Pick-6 prize will also be shared with three children of a brother who died a few years ago.

Family: There are 18 siblings in the Enderson family, and they will all share their sister's $20 million lottery winnings

Tradition: The Endersons' mother started playing the lottery years ago, and the family has kept the tradition alive

Sixty-nine-year-old John Endreson became emotional when he described rebuilding his home after Sandy ripped through the shore area in late October 2012.

'The hardest part was seeing other people that were devastated,' he said. 'I was able to redo my house and help my family and my brothers. I was quite fortunate. I just feel so lucky. And this is just the icing on the cake.'

Another sibling described how their late mother started playing the lottery regularly years ago and would always say that all her children would get a piece of the winnings.

Faith Schiabor told how she got the news from one of her sisters who had bought the winning ticket.  

Taxes: After taxes, the family will share about $10 million between the 18 of them and the children of a brother who died several years ago

Sister of the year: Sigrid Endreson is the family member who picked the winning ticket and then decided to share it with her family

'I got this frantic phone call,' she said. 'She said, 'Are you sitting down?' I thought someone was hurt.'

Her sister Sigrid told reporters Thursday that she bought the tickets and then forgot about them for about two weeks before going down to a supermarket to check them.

When one came back with the message, 'see cashier,' she ran it through again before taking it up to the window and getting the good news.

'I started to cry,' she said. 'I called my sister to come get me. I didn't think I was going to make it. I said, ''I think I won the lottery.'"

Milk run: Enderson bought the winning ticket at this 7-Eleven when she stopped in to buy milk

The family has decided to take a lump sum payment of $14 million, which is worth about $10 million after taxes.

'It's going to help the family, it's going to help Ocean County,' Schiabor said. 'It's just a great pick-me-up for all of us.'
