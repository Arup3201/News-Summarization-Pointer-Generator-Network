A swan was left to die after being shot at point blank range through his beak by a 'sick' marksman with an inch-long metal ball bearing.

Animal rescue centre owner Kevin Drew managed to rescue the distressed swan after fishing him out of the River Avon at Salisbury in Wiltshire, and took him  to a vet to undergo life saving surgery.

In a delicate piece of surgery the vet removed the inch-long ball bearing from Jack the swan's beak, leaving a gaping wound

Mr Drew then took Jack to an animal hospital where he received around the clock treatment for several days.

Mr Drew had been called to the River Avon by a sharp eyed member of the public who had noticed the severely injured swan

Now Wiltshire Police have confirmed they have launched an investigation into the shooting.

A police spokesman said: 'We urgently need witnesses to come forward.'

The incident took place while Jack was with a flock of swans in the water at the Maltings, where they have congregated for many years.

Today a furious Mr Drew, who runs Creatures in Crisis animal rescue centre, stressed Jack was close to death when he found him.

He said: 'If the ball bearing had hit a child or adult they would have been killed - the person who did this is just sick.

'I am outraged at what has happened to this swan.

'The swan has been left with a huge hole in his beak. The ball bearing must have been fired at point blank range

'If we had not rescued it the swan would have died very quickly from the infection.' 

Later this week Jack will be returned to the River Avon - but at a quiet location so he will not be shot at again.
