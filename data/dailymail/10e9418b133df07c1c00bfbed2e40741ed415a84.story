A Brazilian man known locally as the ‘Ninja of Serpents’ came face-to-face with a pair of snakes in his latest date with danger.

Captured on camera, Arteval Duarte holds what appear to be two BCC Boa Constrictors – native to South America – in his hands as he addresses the camera.

He releases the snakes – also known as Red-tailed boas – and starts to blow up a balloon, dodging one of the snakes that lunges at him.

The snakes watch him intently as the balloon he is inflating gets bigger and closer to them before violently lunging at him without warning.

Bursting the balloon instantly, the snake comes incredibly close to puncturing the man's face. 

The viper then retreats back to its original position and Duarte begins to blow up another balloon.

Arteval Duarte is known locally as the ‘Ninja of Serpents’ because of his many filmed encounters with snakes

He repeats the dangerous feat three more times – the two snakes taking it in turns to pop the balloons as he compliments their intelligence.

The video concludes with the snake ninja approaching the constrictors on the table and after dodging another lunge, grabbing and holding onto them.

According to Duarte, the two snakes have been trained to obey his commands and bursting balloons from his mouth like this appears to be something they are used to doing.

The motive for the stunt is in apparent protest against the deforestation of the Amazon.

The mouth of the snake that bursts the balloon is only inches away from puncturing Duarte's face

Duarte blows up a total of four balloons and the two snakes appear to take it in turns bursting them

Arteval has specialised in performing bizarre stunts with snakes for 15 years to protest the deforestation of the Amazon

Arteval says that he dedicates his life to protecting the habitats of animals and that his videos bring attention to the problems.

Specialising in bizarre stunts for over 15 years, Arteval has also been recorded putting tarantulas and scorpions in his mouth.

He has been bitten by many snakes in his time, which may give an explanation for the bandage on his arm.
