TUNNEL CUDDLES

Good job Roy Keane wasn’t around when the two teams were lining up in the tunnel before the game. Gone are the days when the two teams are eyeballing each other in the moments before kick off because now it is all cuddles. Former Villa defender Richard Dunne and Ron Vlaar were having a proper love in before they walked out. Where’s Keano when you need him?

TOUGH WEEK 

It has been a week of setbacks for QPR chairman Tony Fernandes. His Caterham F1 team went into administration and he has also had some bad news on his plans to press ahead with a stadium development at Old Oak Common. Cargiant, the current owners of the land where Fernandes hopes to build a super stadium, have announced they are pressing ahead with their own regeneration plans in the area... and it doesn’t involve QPR.

RIO ROTTING ON THE BENCH 

Harry Redknapp made a big decision to leave Rio Ferdinand out of the QPR team to face Liverpool, but sitting on the bench at Loftus Road is no way to end one of the great players’ careers. Ferdinand is no longer at the peak of his powers and it will be agony to watch him go out like this.

SIX PACK? 

A week tafter Adel Taarabt posed with his shirt off to prove he wasn’t three stone overweight, QPR owner Tony Fernandes got in on the act too by putting his own topless selfie on social media. The airline boss has not quite such an impressive six pack, though - more of a Watney’s Party Barrel.

RUSTY BENTEKE

When Christian Benteke returned from a muscle injury at the start of last season it took him three months to get up to Premier League pace - his next goal after getting hurt at Norwich in September didn’t come until January. He looked rusty on Monday night - bad news for boss Paul Lambert who needs his main striker to come good quickly.
