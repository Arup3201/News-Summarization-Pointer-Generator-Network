She's at it again! Now Katie Hopkins has launched an attack on ginger babies by saying that they are 'so much harder to love'

Just last week she enraged This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby after claiming it was acceptable to judge children based on their names.

And now Katie Hopkins has launched another attack, this time on ginger-haired people, by revealing she did not want any of her children to be born with the fiery hair colour.

The former Apprentice star had ignited controversy on Twitter last week when she wrote: 'Ginger babies. Like a baby. Just so much harder to love.'

Now Katie, 38, has gone further with her thoughts on ginger-haired people in an interview with OK! magazine.

Asked
if her two daughters India, nine, and Poppy, seven, were ginger, she 
said: 'Oh no, they're definitely brown. We don't have a ginger in the 
family.

'That was the first question I asked when I gave birth to Max (her son aged four): "Is he ginger?"

'There's nothing worse than a ginger boy especially in the young years.'

She also repeated her comments on The Wright Stuff on Channel 5 this morning, which sparked a fresh flurry of outrage on Twitter.

Nicola Dougan @nicolalalalala tweeted: 'Katie Hopkins is very wrong...ginger babies are just as easy to love.'

No redheads here: Asked if her two daughters India, nine, and Poppy, seven, were ginger, she said: 'Oh no, they're definitely brown. We don't have a ginger in the family' and said there's nothing worse than a ginger boy in his young years

Jennifer Halliday @captain-jen said: 'That vile bully Katie Hopkins has tweeted horrendous things about ginger babies and dissed the name Ethan, yet thinks Cosmo is a great name.'

Amanda Egan @Mummy-Misfit posted: 'After Katie Hopkins' tweet about ginger babies, I am now convinced she is being paid vast sums of money to be vile. Next it will be a book.'

Tom Pilcher @tompilch tweeted: 'Ooh Katie Hopkins has slagged off ginger babies. One step too far.'

Angry tweets: She also repeated her comments on The Wright Stuff on Channel 5 this morning, which sparked a fresh flurry of outrage on Twitter with people calling her a 'disgrace' and 'offensive'

Enraged: Asked about popular baby names on ITV's This Morning show, Miss Hopkins criticised 'lower class' children with names like Chantelle, Charmaine, Chardonnay and Tyler, infuriating presenter Holly Willoughby  

Katie sent out her angry tweet about ginger children while she was 
already at the centre of a storm over her comments on ITV1's This 
Morning programme that she wouldn't want her children playing with 
children with names like Tyler and Charmaine as they were likely to be 
from a certain class.

Asked about popular baby names on ITV’s 
This Morning show on Wednesday, Miss Hopkins began to criticise ‘lower 
class’ children with names like Chantelle, Charmaine, Chardonnay and 
Tyler.

‘I think you can tell a great deal 
from a name,’ said mother-of-three Miss Hopkins, 38. ‘For me, there’s 
certain names that I hear and I think “urgh”. 

‘For me, a name is a shortcut of 
finding out what class a child comes from and makes me ask: “Do I want 
my children to play with them?”

Shock: Miss Willoughby was flabbergasted at Katie's comments, responding: 'Listen to what you are saying. You judge children on names. That¿s extraordinary' but Katie didn't seem to care

Not a fan: Katie isn't a fan of people with the same hair colour as Prince Harry and Ed Sheeran, saying: 'There's nothing worse than a ginger boy especially in the young years'

‘When I hear screeched across the 
playground: “Tyler! Come back ‘ere.” It’s the Tylers, the Charmains the 
Chantelles, the Chardonnays.’

Miss Willoughby, 32, was 
flabbergasted, responding: ‘Listen to what you are saying. You judge 
children on names. That’s extraordinary.’

Co-host Phillip Schofield was then 
forced to intervene, asking the women to speak one at a time as the 
argument threatened to boil over.

And the nine-minute debate has now 
become an internet sensation, with 3.5million people viewing the clip on
YouTube in only two days.

Katie rose to fame following her 2007 appearance on the third UK series of TV reality programme The Apprentice.

Hopkins resigned from the programme during the eleventh week, but not before she had becoming one of the show's most infamous contestants thanks to her controversial comments and attitude towards other 
contestants.

Big break: Katie first became known as a contestant on The Apprentice and was notorious for her critical comments of other contestants
