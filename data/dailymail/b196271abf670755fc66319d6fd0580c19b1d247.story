Quarter finals have been a sticking point for Andy Murray this season and last night's US Open draw did not spare him a difficult potential last eight match - against none other than Novak Djokovic.

Seven times in 2014 Murray has bowed out of events at this stage, and now a showdown with the world number one awaits, providing the Serb can rediscover the form that has gone missing since winning Wimbledon.

Djokovic has won just two matches in two months, seemingly distracted by his marriage and the impending birth of his first child. Yet he has the chance to play himself in next week, with the 27 year-old Scot having plenty to think about prior to that. Andy Murray is training at 100 percent after back problems

Big ask: Murray could have to face the likes of Verdasco and Tsonga if he is to reach the quarter-finals

Tricky: The Scott is up against it as he attempts to repeat his 2012 success in New York

Andy Murray has a tough task to reach the final. To do so, he'll probably have to beat the following:

First Round: R. Haase (Hol) 

Second Round: R. Stepanek (CZ) 

Third Round: F. Verdasco (SP) 

Fourth Round: JW Tsonga (FRA) 

Quarter Final: N. Djokovic (SER) 

Semi Final: S. Wawrinka (SWI) 

Final: R. Federer (SWI). 

His first round opponent is Robin Haase, the Dutchman ranked number 70 who almost knocked him out at Flushing Meadows three years ago in five sets. His third round could be against hard hitting Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, with Jo Wilfried Tsonga in the fourth.

The Frenchman had a dreadful start to the year, but roared back to form this month by winning the Canadian Open - beating Murray en route in the quarter finals.

This is a rough looking draw for Murray, now seeded eighth, as he tries to put behind him the last eight exit to Grigor Dimitrov at SW19, but then he looked to have a bad one at Wimbledon 2013 and everyone knows what happened after that. 

Formidable: Frenchman Tsonga is a difficult opponent to face as early as the fourth round at a Grand Slam

In form: Tsonga won the Rogers Cup in Toronto this month, where he beat Murray in the quarter-final

It seems ridiculous to look beyond Djokovic, but Murray's theoretical semi-final opponent is Stan Wawrinka. The man most favoured to reach the final from the opposite half is Roger Federer, who has amassed a 19-2 record since the French Open. The now 33 year-old looks to have a relatively benign draw.

Overall both the men's and women's events look relatively unpredictable. British number one Heather Watson has a winnable first round against Sorana Cirstea of Romania, who has won just one match since Wimbledon.

After that it could be Eugenie Bouchard, whose form has plummeted since the All England Club final. Britain's other guaranteed entrant, Jo Konta, faces Shahar Peer of Israel.

Top seed: World No 1 Djokovic will be the man to beat, and could meet Murray in the last eight

No defence: Rafa Nadal will not be defending his title after withdrawing because of an injured wrist
