Elegant in a powder pink coat and matching hat, the Queen was every inch the style icon as she was welcomed to Paris by France's President Hollande in front of the Arc de Triomphe.

After arriving by Eurostar from London, the monarch had changed into a pale pink tweed jacket and matching skirt for a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe alongside the French premier.

The British head of state and her French counterpart arrived together in a maroon Bentley, which was driven over from London earlier in the week, and were greeted by a sea of Union flags which lined the Champs-Élysées, as well as a military guard of honour.

During the two-hour journey to Paris, the Queen, perhaps with the French capital's formidably stylish residents in mind, changed into her second outfit of the day: a cream lace dress worn with a cream sequin trimmed jacket and a matching hat.

After arriving in Paris, the Queen was met by a guard of honour before being driven to the Élysée Palace, where she and the Duke of Edinburgh will stay during her two-day visit.

and William Hague at the garden party.

Afterwards, she is set to return to the Élysée Palace to recover ahead of tomorrow's D-Day commemorations in Normandy.

There, the royal couple will join Prince Charles and the 
Duchess of Cornwall, as well as 70 heads of state from around the world,
 including Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin, for a series of ceremonies to mark the 70th anniversary of the largest maritime operation the world has ever seen.

After a remembrance service at Bayeux Cemetery, the Queen will meet veterans from the Commonwealth, before travelling to Sword Beach, where British forces attacked on 6th June 1944, for another ceremony.

Following a ceremonial leave-taking at Villacoublay Airport, the monarch will travel home for her final engagement of the week, a trip to the Epsom Downs racecourse for the Derby.

The most prestigious of the five British Classics, the Derby remains the only one that the Queen hasn't yet won.

Despite first place having so far eluded her, the monarch did manage a second place finish with Aureole in 1953 and came third in 2011 with Carlton House.

First run in 1780, the Derby is also boasts the largest prize money - £1,325,000 - of any British race, and as a result, attracts some of the world's top equine talent.

Hotly tipped runners in this year's event include the favourite, a chestnut three-year-old named Australia, and his stablemates Orchestra and Geoffrey Chaucer.
