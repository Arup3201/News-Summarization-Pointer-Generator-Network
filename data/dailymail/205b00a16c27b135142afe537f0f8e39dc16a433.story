However, Campbell issued a video  dismissing reports he was seeking a move away, having just retuned to the Emirates Stadium following a productive loan spell at Olympiacos.

'What they have been saying is not true, I'm very calm. I have not been furious,' the 22-year-old said on www.sports.bycampbell.com on Sunday.

'Obviously, yes, I would like to be playing, but that's something that has to be earned day by day. I have to keep training and waiting for the opportunity, I know it's a very competitive team.

'Arsenal is one of the best teams in the world where there are many important players. I have to be patient, keep training and I know my chance will arrive and I'll have to take advantage of it when it comes.

'[I've learned] a lot (from Arsene Wenger). He is a coach who has many years in football and with Arsenal. I am learning from him and from my peers every day in training. I'm doing my best to be a better player every day.'
