Donald Sterling, the National Basketball Association team owner who was hit last week by charges of racism, used his charitable foundation to steer at least $135,000 to charities that focus on African-American issues – including the Museum of Tolerance.

A voice purported to be that of Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers franchise, was recorded in a racist rant chastising his reported mistress for associating publicly with black people.

But through the Donald T. Sterling Foundation, which he set up in 2007, he donated $30,000 to the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, and $50,000 each to the United Negro College Fund and the Black Business Association of Los Angeles.

Sterling's donations could be a form of public-relations inoculation against future criticism. None of those groups has publicly rebuked him since the tape surfaced on Friday.

The United Negro College Fund told MailOnline on Monday that it won't give back the money.

SCROLL DOWN TO HEAR THE RACIST RANT AND READ THE TAX RETURNS

Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling spent $135,000 on charities that work on issues surrounding African Americans and other minority groups -- standing inn sharp contrast with his alleged blatant racism

The Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles got $30,000 from Sterling, a gift that the organization hasn't said whether it will keep

'UNCF has not had any conversation regarding returning money back to Donald Sterling,' the group's national communications director Anthony Owens said.

'All funds raised by UNCF are used to provide scholarships to help get minority students to and through school and we would never ask the student to return the money.'

None of the other organizations responded to questions about whether they will send Sterling's money back.

A separate $5,000 grant went to the Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP in 2010. That organization has rescinded its offer to present Sterling with its 2014 Lifetime Achievement Award.

Sterling has already won the honor once before, in 2009.

The grants came between 2009 and 2012. The foundation's 'Form 990' tax return for 2013 is not yet due to the Internal Revenue Service. 

The NAACP,
 America's most visible African-American advocacy organization, received
 a grant from Sterling's foundation in 2013, according to the NBA, but the amount has not yet been disclosed.

A
 voice that sounds like Sterling's is heard on the tape telling a woman 
that 'it bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you’re 
associating with black people. Do you have to?'

'You
 can sleep with them. You can bring them in, you can do whatever you 
want,' the man says. 'The little I ask you is not to promote it on that 
... and not to bring them to my games ... in your lousy f****ing 
Instagrams, you don’t have to have yourself with, walking with black 
people.'

The New York Times reported
 Monday that Sterling's current racial black eye isn't his first: In 
2009 he paid a $2.725 million lawsuit settlement to dispense with the 
U.S. Justice Department's charge that he systematically shoved Hispanic 
and black  Americans, and families with children, out of his apartment 
buildings.

Rochelle Sterling, Donald's wife, is suing his alleged lover for the return of $1.8 million in cash, cars and other items he allegedly gave her -- reportedly leading to the mistress' leak of the tape

He hasn't 
spoken publicly about whether the voice on the recording is his, but 
sports columnists and broadcasters and NBA insiders are convinced.

TMZ reported
 Monday that his former mistress, the 38-year-old V. Stiviano, 
reportedly has more than 100 hours of secretly made recordings, 
including other conversations that could prove embarrassing to the 
Clippers owner.

She is also shopping a book to several publishers, the gossip website claimed.

Stiviano now claims she was merely Sterling's 'archivist,' not his lover.

Stiviano lawyer Mac Nehoray said in an e-mail Sunday to the Los Angeles Times that the male voice heard on the 15-minute recording, berating her for being seen in public with NBS legend Magic Johnson and her other black friends, is definitely Sterling's.

NAACP Interim President Lorraine Miller told NBC's 'Meet the Press' on Sunday that Donald Sterling will not receive his group's lifetime achievement award, which this pre-printed program announces

Sterling, 81, has responded by claiming that the release of the tape to TMZ is Stiviano's attempt to exact revenge on his wife Rochelle for suing her over her husband's affair.

That legal action seeks $1.8 in cash, property, cars and other items Sterling reportedly gave her – including a Ferrari, two Bentleys and an apartment worth more than $1 million.

The Clippers  protested their owner Sunday night by stripping off their jerseys during a pre-game warmup, turning them inside-out so the logo couldn't be seen, and throwing them in the center of the basketball court.
