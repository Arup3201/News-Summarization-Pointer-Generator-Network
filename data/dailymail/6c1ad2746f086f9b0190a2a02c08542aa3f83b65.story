For the 10 per cent of the world's population who are left-handed, writing left to right on paper is a chore; as their hand moves across the page, it often smudges the ink.

But a left-handed woman fed up with smudging letters whenever she writes in ink has invented a special glove that will stop 'lefties' from blotting their copy books.

The garment covers half of the hand and just the little finger and creates a barrier from the paper to stop any smudging. 

An entrepreneurial mum inspired by her son has invented a glove to stop left-handed people covering their fingers in ink or pencil while writing.

Called SmudgeGuard, the glove is made from spandex and nylon and stops any perspiration from the skin touching the page, which is the usual cause for stains.

The glove will protect a hand from a variety of substances such as ink, paints, crayons and chalk.

It has been invented by Jeannie Lit from New Jersey, who struggles whenever she writes as her hand drags along the page and becomes covered in ink.

When she realised her son was also left handed, she decided to invent something that could help him.

She made a prototype by cutting up a sock and has now developed the product, which retails at £9.65 ($14.99).

Jeannie, 43, from New Jersey in the US, said: 'I'm left handed and when I was writing in school the little finger and underside of my left hand would get graphite or ink on it.

'When I found out my son was left handed too that's when I realised he would have the same exact problem as me.

'I searched high and low online for a solution and I couldn't find any product that could help solve it.

'I made a prototype with a sock which I cut up and made a covering for the little finger, and tested it by writing with pencils, pens, markers and crayons.

'The glove got dirty, but not my hand or the page and that was my ultimate goal. I named the product the SmudgeGuard.'

The glove will protect a hand from a variety of implements such as pen, pencil, paints, crayon (shown) and chalk. The gadget is made from spandex and nylon and stops any perspiration from the skin touching the page, which is the usual cause for stains

Frustrating: Using an ink pen when left-handed can make writing neat messages almost impossible

When a person writes their hand can perspire, which makes ink or graphite adhere to the moist skin and causes smudges to appear.

Perspiration from a person's hand will then re-smudge the paper.

But according to Ms Lit, wearing the SmudgeGuard 'keeps the sweaty hand away from ink or graphite and it will allow your hand to glide over the paper more easily.'

The outer fabric also remains dry, making it less likely to re-smudge the paper.  

The SmudgeGuard comes in two varieties; one style covers just the little finger and the second type covers two fingers. 

The glove can also be used by tablet users (shown) to prevent their hand sticking to their device. It was invented by Jeannie Lit, who is left handed and struggled when she was writing at school because her hand would drag along the page and become covered in ink

Designers have come up with an eco-friendly alternative to the traditional hairdryer - a pair of revolutionary gloves made from hi-tech microfibres (shown above).

The 'Hair Drying Gloves' look just like ordinary gloves and their makers claim they dry wet hair twice as fast as the traditional bathroom towel.

The microfibres in the gloves are apparently specifically designed to absorb the water and leave hair completely dry; they even work without removing styling products such as hair gel and hairspray.

Online retailer Hammacher Schlemmer, which is selling the gloves for around £13 ($20), say they are the best way to dry hair.

Those who get caught in heavy showers can also dry their hair quickly by putting on the handy gloves and rubbing their wet tresses, say the makers.
