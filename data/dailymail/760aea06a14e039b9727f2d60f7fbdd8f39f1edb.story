A great grandfather has been asked for ID in a supermarket to prove he's old enough to buy alcohol.

War veteran Tony Ball, who is 92, didn't have anything to prove he is over 18 - so he was told he couldn't buy the two bottles of vodka he wanted.

Mr Ball - who has 16 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren - was buying the bottles for Christmas presents and at first thought the checkout girl at Tesco in Feltham, West London, was joking.

Tony Ball, 92, was asked for ID when he went to buy two bottles of Vodka for a family Christmas party from Tesco in Feltham

'I laughed but she then said, "We're not allowed to serve you if you're under age",' he said.

'By the look on her face she wasn't joking. I said, "Do you mean it?" and she said, "Yes". So I said, "You can tell Tesco what to do with their stuff," and walked out.'

Mr Ball, who fought in North Africa and Italy in the Second World War, added: 'I went to another shop across the road and it was cheaper.'

The checkout girl's manager later admitted she had done it before 'as a joke'.

Old enough: Tony with his driving licence showing his date of birth, which is September 19, 1921

But Mr Ball told The Sun: 'I can take a joke but that wasn't a joke. I was embarrassed as well because there were other people in the queue.'

A spokesman for Tesco said: 'Our colleague was trying to be lighthearted, but we appreciate the joke wasn't shared.

'We have apologised and we're keeping Mr Ball's bottles for him if he chooses to drop by, with our compliments.'
