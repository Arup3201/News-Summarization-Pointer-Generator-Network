Ukraine is accusing Russian-backed rebels of destroying their ceasefire agreement by seizing the town Vladimir Putin wanted them to capture.

Pro-Moscow separatists claim to have captured 80 per cent of Debaltseve and to have taken at least 300 government soldiers prisoner as fierce fighting raged in the eastern Ukrainian town yesterday.

Eyewitnesses said artillery rounds were hitting the town every five seconds and smoke rose skywards as unguided Grad rockets landed.

‘Eighty per cent of Debaltseve is already ours,’ said Eduard Basurin, a rebel leader.

‘A clean-up of the town is under way.’ He said negotiations were under way for 5,000 Ukrainian troops trapped in its bombed-out streets to surrender. 

‘Hundreds’ had been captured and would eventually be released to their families, he added.

Ukraine’s president Petro Poroshenko urged the world to stop the attacks.

‘I call on the permanent members of the UN Security Council to prevent further violation of fundamental principles and rules of the UN and the unleashing of a full-scale war in the very centre of Europe,’ he said in a statement.

The Obama administration distanced itself from arming Ukraine. 

A State Department spokesman said: ‘Our belief here in the administration, and I would be surprised if others disagree, is that getting into a proxy war with Russia is not in the interest of Ukraine or the international community.’

Independent observers attempting to monitor the so-called ceasefire have been unable to enter the town due to the intensity of the fighting, although Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said Ukraine would withdraw heavy weapons as soon as their forces stopped coming under attack.

Fighting is raging near Debaltseve because both the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatists are demanding the strategically important town falls on their side of the armistice line before they will lay down their weapons.

Ukrainian government troops and Russia-backed rebels face a deadline  to start pulling back heavy weapons from the front line in eastern Ukraine, although there is no sign of that happening so far.

The ministry said street fighting continued in Debaltseve, which has been the epicenter of fighting in the past two weeks. It did not say how many soldiers had been seized in the ambush.

The Ukrainian presidential office earlier  called on the European Union and NATO to condemn the Russia-backed rebels for violating the cease-fire brokered by European leaders last week.

Russian news agencies quoted Valery Chaly, chief of the Ukrainian presidential administration, as saying that Kiev wants the EU and NATO to 'resolutely condemn' the separatists for violating the deals.

Earlier Lysenko said the separatists continued to attack government positions overnight around Debaltseve and that the pullout hinged on the cease-fire being fully observed.

He added that at least five troops were killed and nine injured in the past 24 hours in the war zone.

The cease-fire deal, brokered by European leaders last week, specifies the pullout begin on the second day after the parties stop fighting. This condition has not been met, Lysenko said.

'As soon as the fire ceases ... we will be ready to begin the withdrawal,' he said.

The war in eastern Ukraine has already killed more than 5,600 people and displaced more than a million, according to U.N. figures issued yesterday. 

It has also left the country's industrial heartland in ruins.

Grief: A funeral is seen being held for a victim of the shelling in eastern Ukraine

Fighting has stopped or subsided in some parts of war-torn eastern Ukraine, however. 

Rebel mouthpiece the Donetsk News Agency quoted rebel officials this morning saying  they had not seen any violations of the cease-fire in their area since 8pm last night.

Journalists today saw artillery rounds fired by Ukrainian troops at rebel bases around Debaltseve. Sustained shelling was also heard in the area, some coming from Grad rocket launchers.

Debaltseve is a government-held town surrounded by rebel forces, and both sides claim it should be on their side of the cease-fire line. The issue was not resolved under a cease-fire agreement negotiated last week by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France.

Elsewhere, at least one rebel leader claimed his troops had begun to withdraw heavy weapons.

'I was at the front line last night, and our tanks, our artillery were pulling back,' Igor Plotnitsky, the leader of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, northeast of Debaltseve, was quoted as saying by the Russian news agency Tass.

He added that he 'expects the same from Ukraine.'

Due to security issues, his claims could not be immediately verified. Lysenko said the Ukrainian troops 'have not noticed any such actions' on the ground.

The separatists were expected to discuss the withdrawal of the weaponry later Tuesday with representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the group charged with monitoring the cease-fire, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

In a phone call late on Monday German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to use his influence on the separatists to ensure that they stop the fighting.

Merkel's office reported that the three leaders agreed on 'concrete steps to enable an observation' of the situation in Debaltseve by the OSCE. It did not elaborate on what these steps would be.

OSCE representatives could not get to Debaltseve on Monday because of the heavy fighting there.
