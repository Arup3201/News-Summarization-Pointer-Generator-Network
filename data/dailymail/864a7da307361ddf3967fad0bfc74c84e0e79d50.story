Last year saw her staff occupying an empty front row, but this season, Somerset House was packed to the rafters for Holly Fulton's  S/S14 offering. 

Best known for her graphic designs and signature printed motifs, Fulton drew inspiration from the seventies but added a modern twist courtesy of structured shapes and a shot of denim.

With soft focus siren Noosha Fox as her muse, Holly's collection was a celebration of woozy summer days, glittering nights and morning lounging.

Sights of the 70s: Holly Fulton unveiled a thoroughly pretty version of the 1970s during her LFW show

Modern: Fulton's 1970s inspired pieces were given a modern makeover courtesy of geometric print

The Holly Fulton woman is one with nonchalant, head-turning confidence, and she translated it into something you can wear via luxurious geometric prints on soft silk trousers and pleated separates. 

Models took to the catwalk in delicate jackets, violet lattice print dresses and some seriously bling crystal chokers which glistened against the light.

Accessories came in the form of sugary lilac and powder pink clutch bags with chunky block wooden heels. 

Denim was key, providing the designer with a matte fabric to contrast with lustrous silks, while dresses and trousers were embellished with digital prints featuring ribbons and flowers. 

It was bold, modern and crisp and light, with romantic florals used to give a nod to the lost 1970s world of Laura Ashley and flower power.

Nonchalant: Chunky knits were paired with buttoned mum skirts

Contrast: Low key denim was paired with lavish printed silk

Ladylike: Print was given a chic edge with pleated skirts

Success: Fulton's show was packed with appreciative onlookers including Jameela Jamil who sat front row

This season saw Fulton attempt a few (not always successful) experiments with cork, which she explained, were inspired by the geometric concrete freezes of William Mitchell. 

The front row was occupied by the ever-present Jameela Jamil and fashion stalwart Hilary Alexander, who had mixed feelings about the show.

Speaking to MailOnline, Alexander said: 'Some of it I liked but it was the styling... I wasn't quite sure about the styling.

I liked the way it was ladylike but done in a much more frumpy way. It was flowing and long where previously, she was much more structured.'

Alexander added: 'I'm a big Holly Fulton fan. No one can make a show as sexy as she can.'
