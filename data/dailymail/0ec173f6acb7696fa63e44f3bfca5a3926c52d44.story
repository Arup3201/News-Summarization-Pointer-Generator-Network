Two officials at San Jose State University officials have been forced to resign after a storm over alleged derogatory comments made about Latino women during a meeting of university employees earlier this year.

Wanda Ginner, a donor and board member of the university's philanthropic Tower Foundation since 2007, resigned on Friday over the long-running incident.

Ginner is alleged to have said that Latina students ‘do not have the DNA to be successful’ during a February meeting. She has denied the allegation.

Within hours of Ginner’s stepping down, Vice President for University Advancement Rebecca Dukes also resigned. She had been criticized for failing to challenge the remarks during the original meeting.

An informal complaint had been made by a Latina administrator present at the meeting. She then filed a formal complaint in August after she wasn't informed of any resolution.

Students have staged protests to voice disapproval with the way the school has handled the accusations.  

The group Students for Racial Equality publicized one of Ginner's purported quotes in a news release: 'I contribute to this university because these little Latinas do not have the DNA to be successful.'

Ginner denies having ever made the statements and says she is dedicated to supporting organizations that help Latinas, the San Jose Mercury News reported.

‘Although many efforts are already underway, a great deal of work lies ahead as we seek to be the welcoming, inclusive community all Spartans aspire to,’ said University President Mo Qayoumi following the resignations. 

Students are now demanding that he issue an apology letter to the original complainant and implement mandatory anti-racism trainings. 

Tower Foundation board chair Amir Mashkoori said Ginner's resigned to stop diverting attention from the university.

‘The fact that Wanda agreed to step down reflects genuine concern for the university and her desire to avoid being a distraction,’ Mashkoori said.

The resignations come a year after four San Jose State University students were charged with misdemeanor hate crimes for abusing a black roommate.

A report on that incident found the university was slow to respond to the students' cruel taunts and abuse, which included writing racial slurs on a whiteboard, hanging a Confederate flag in their suite, and barricading him in his room.
