It was billed as a historic portrait of David Cameron in the House of Commons surrounded by a loyal ‘family’ of virtually all Tory MPs.

The photo, taken shortly before this summer’s recess and unveiled ahead of last week’s Conservative Party Conference, was thought to be the first such picture of the parliamentary party in the Chamber.

But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that several of the MPs apparently proudly posing with the Prime Minister were not actually present when the photograph was taken.

False unity: The circled MPs were added to this photograph after it was taken as they were unable to attend

In what has been described as  an ‘entirely inappropriate’ move, images of the missing Tories were added to the picture later.

Embarrassingly, that included Simon Burns, who only last week resigned as Rail Minister to stand as Commons Deputy Speaker.

He said he was unable to attend the photo call ‘due to a constituency commitment’ and was asked by party bosses to have his picture taken separately. He is shown, circled, in the left-hand foreground.

Directly behind him is colleague Steve Baker, MP for Wycombe. To the left of Mr Baker is Richard Drax, MP for South Dorset.

Both confirmed they had posed later 
before being slotted into the shot, which shows a smiling Mr Cameron 
flanked by Foreign Secretary William Hague and Leader of the Commons 
Andrew Lansley.

Behind
Mr Baker and Mr Drax is the Health Minister, Anna Soubry, also circled,
who admitted she ‘couldn’t be there on the day’ as she was in Liverpool
promoting the use of life-saving defibrillators.

Photoshopped: From left to right, Health Minister Anna Soubry, Richard Drax, Steve Baker (behind) and former Rail Minister Simon Burns (in front) were inserted into the left side of the photograph. Michael Ellis, right, was added in at the other side of the picture

Missing: Simon Burns, the former Rail Minister who is hoping to become Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, didn't make the photo

Busy: Health Minister Anna Soubry was in Liverpool promoting defibrillators at the time of the photograph

Posed later: Richard Drax, MP for South Dorset, was subsequently added to the image

Absentee: Steve Baker, MP for Wycombe, also missed out on the shoot

At home: Michael Ellis, MP for Northampton, was in his constituency at the time

Meanwhile, superimposed in the right-hand foreground is Northampton MP Michael Ellis, circled, who said he was in his constituency as a minister was visiting that day.

Last night, Labour MPs condemned the ‘trickery’, while even some Tory MPs privately said it was wrong.

Thomas Docherty, Labour vice-chairman of the Commons’ administration committee, said: ‘This was supposed to be a snapshot in history – not some elaborate fake they can keep adding to.’

Last night, Ms Soubry dismissed suggestions that the picture in any way deceived voters. She said: ‘Some of us couldn’t be there because we were doing things like trying to save children’s lives.’
