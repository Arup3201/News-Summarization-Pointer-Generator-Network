An 11-year-old Texas girl is facing possible blindness as a consequence of a brain disorder that appeared soon after another child threw a football at her face.

Gwendolyn Quarles, whose parents say they had repeatedly complained to the school about their daughter being picked on, was sent to see the nurse after the incident at The Founder's Classic Academy in Austin last October.

Later that same day her parents took her to a nearyby emergency room where she was diagnosed with intracranial hypertension. It is a neurological disorder where pressure inside the skull chokes off the optic nerve from the brain.

Gwendolyn was diagnosed with intracranial hypertension - a neurological disorder where pressure inside the skull chokes off the optic nerve from the brain

Symptoms include headaches, nausea and vomiting, as well as tinnitus and double vision. In extreme cases the patient can go blind.

Doctors cannot definitively confirm that Gwendolyn's disorder is a result of her school injury, but the condition is commonly brought on by severe head injuries.

The girl's parents believe the bullying incident was to blame for their daughter's condition.

'On the day of the injury, Gwendolyn was in gym class and the coaches left the children alone,' her father Patrick Quarles told ABC News.

'There seems to have been an argument and then she remembers a ball flying at her.'

It's unclear whether Quarles will completely recover from the injury and her parents fear she may go blind even if she undergoes risky and expensive surgery.

The family has already amassed substantial medical bills as the condition isn't completely covered by their insurance.

A GoFundMe.com campaign has raised over $5,000 to help cover the costs, which Quarles said are piling up quickly.

The family said they sent at least 23 emails to Gwendolyn's school, in which they expressed their concerns that their daughter was being bullied a group of other girls. 

The school, which Quarles' said did make attempts to remedy the situation, would neither confirm nor deny the incident occurred. Quarles said he doesn't intend to sue to the school.
