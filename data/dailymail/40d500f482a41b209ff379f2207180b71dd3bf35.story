Workers digging an underground garage for a new hotel  recently struck something big about 30 feet below the surface.

This week they uncovered it - a boulder that's thousands of years old and bigger than an SUV, weighing an estimated 150 tons or 300,000lbs. 

A geotechnical engineer who was called out to examine the giant rock in Everett, Washington. 

The rock, which weighs 150 tons and is bigger than an SUV was discovered in Everett, Washington. It is believed that a glacier left the 'erratic rock' there around 18,000 years ago

The  rock is bigger than an SUV and close to 19 feet long and 10 feet wide, The Daily Herald reported. Several drill bits were broken due to the rock.  

Geotechnical expert Kurt Merriman, told The Daily Herald  it's a glacial erratic - a giant rock left behind by a glacier. maybe 18,000 years ago.

It is likely that the boulder traveled from northern Canada or Alaska, the engineer said. 

The site superintendent for the Halvorson Construction Group, Ben Hansen, said it may give the boulder to the city to try to find it a home. 

Work on the new Courtyard by Marriot hotel was suspended following the fascinating find.  

A glacial erratic is a piece of rock that is totally different from the size and type of rock in the area where it has been found. 

'Erratics' are normally carried by glacial ice, often over distances of hundreds of kilometers.

Glacial erratics can range from pebbles to one of the largest ever found in Alberta, Canada. Big Rock as it is known weighs 16,500 tons.
