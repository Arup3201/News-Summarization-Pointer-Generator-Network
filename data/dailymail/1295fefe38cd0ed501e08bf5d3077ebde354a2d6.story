A nurse is facing a mastectomy after refusing to challenge her doctor's opinion when her concerns over breast cancer were dismissed.

Rika Turner did not want to 'overstep the boundaries' by questioning her GP, despite suspecting something was wrong.

The 38-year-old went to see a doctor last year, after feeling tenderness in her breast.

The mother-of-one from Gloucester was reassured there was nothing sinister to blame, but despite suspecting that was not the case, Ms Turner accepted her doctor's opinion.

Nurse Rika Turner is facing a mastectomy after a doctor dismissed her breast cancer fears, only to find she had a cancerous lump months later. The mother-of-one said she didn't want to 'be a nuisance' by 'challenging' her GP's opinion

She said she 'didn't want to be a nuisance', and so did not raise doubts.

But months later when she raised the problem with her GP she was referred for a scan, which revealed a cancerous lump in her breast.

She now faces a mastectomy to remove all the breast tissue, to try and stop the disease spreading.

She said: 'My doctor couldn’t feel anything and, although I did, I didn’t want to be a nuisance.

'I
 thought the doctor knows best. As a nurse, I didn’t want to overstep 
any boundaries by making a self diagnosis or assumptions and I therefore
 put my trust in someone of a higher level of education than myself.

'Nobody
 wants to think they’ll ever be diagnosed with cancer. I put it to the 
back of my mind because I felt reassured by my GP initially.'

Ms Turner, who is mother to five-year-old Erica, first noticed her breast was tender last February.

She suspected it was hormone-related but went to see her doctor when she felt a lump a few weeks later.

After initially being told there was nothing wrong, she raised the issue again several months later when she visited her GP about another matter.

It was then she was referred for a scan.

'I already knew it was positive from the look on the radiographer’s face,' she said.

The South African native was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent surgery to remove the cancer, which was orginally 2cm but had spread 5cm.

She is due to undergo a mastectomy later in the year and recently took part in Cancer Research’s Race for Life in Cheltenham.

'It was the first time I had taken part in Race for Life. It made me feel good to be part of something positive,' she said.

'I would not be where I am today without the research Race for Life helps to pay for.'
