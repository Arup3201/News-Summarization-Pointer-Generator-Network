The pound shops, pawnbrokers and empty premises suggest a high street struggling to attract shoppers.

But one sector at least is thriving – the street has 12 charity shops which have become a magnet for bargain hunters from far and wide.

Orpington High Street contains branches for disability charity Scope, Marie Curie Cancer Care, the British Heart Foundation, The Children’s Trust, Age UK, Save the Children, Oxfam, pet charity PDSA and two local hospices. An 11th charity, Cancer Research UK, has two shops almost facing each other.

Influx: Charity shops now dominate Orpington High Street as businesses have gone bust

Thriving: Business is doing well for charity shops in Orington, Kent, but at the expense of small independent businesses

In one stretch of the high street in Orpington, charity streets dominate the landscape

The charity shops have filled the spaces left by local business that have gone bust and vacated

Mandy Wines, manageress of both 
stores, said the street in South-East London had become a well-known 
destination for charity shop devotees from miles around who come in 
their hundreds every day.

In other ways, however, it stands as a
 symbol of the sad decline of Britain’s local shopping districts.

There 
are few independent grocery stores or well-known clothing shops to draw 
real money into the town.

Some local traders say the Tesco superstore which opened at one end of the road several years ago caused several shops to close.

Others say the departure of Marks 
& Spencer to the nearby Nugent shopping centre contributed to the 
street falling on hard times.

Thrifty shoppers come fore far and wide to hunt for bargains among the mountains of goods in the charity shops

Lack of choice: Local residents complain that there is a lack of choice for them now on the high street which is now dominated by second-hand shops and pound-stores

Jacob Christodoulou, 30, owner of a 
nearby barber shop, said: ‘When Marks & Spencer was here there was a
 reason for shoppers to come. But now there are just charity shops and 
coffee shops.’

Many of the charities have opened in 
premises once occupied by the businesses that were the street’s 
lifeblood.

The PDSA shop used to be a Doulton China store, while Scope 
occupies a former wool shop.

His views were shared by Agnieszka Parker, manager of Ola’s Place sandwich shop.

She said: 'The amount of charity shops
 shows how bad things have got around here. There is no variety of shops
 down this street anymore.'

At one point in the street two shops for one charity, Cancer Research UK, are virtually on opposite each other

The council says is has introduced measures to try to encourage shoppers back into the town centre

Local businessman Warren Tull said: 'It’s all charity shops and pound shops now.'

The Scope store’s manager, Jason Cuffe said the street had recently lost, among others, a pet shop and two computer stores. 'It’s been a steady decline,' he said.

Plans for a new cinema complex have 
raised hopes of a change in fortune, while the local council says it has
 introduced other measures to encourage shoppers back, including a new 
library.

Councillor Peter Morgan, Executive Councillor for Renewal and Recreation at Bromley Council said the authority has carried out a number of initiatives 'focused on raising the town’s profile'. 

Plans for a new cinema in the area have raised hopes that fortunes for the Orpington could be about to change

'These have included the successful 
£2.2million High Street improvements, opened by the Mayor of London, 
which welcomed new retail investors to the town and enhanced the public 
realm and the relocation of the library to a brand new building in the 
heart of the town centre, which has significantly increased footfall 
figures,' he said.

The council hopes a new Business 
Improvement District (BID), will give businesses 'real power over the 
management of their town'. 

He added: 'With a new seven screen 
Odeon cinema and retail development coming soon the future looks bright 
for the town. Orpington has a very low (retail) vacancy rate, much below
 the national average and we are looking to keep it that way.'
