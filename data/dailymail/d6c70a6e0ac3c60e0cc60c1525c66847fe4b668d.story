Dozens of stolen bikes have been found crammed into the back yard of a house.

Stunned officers found the 146 pedal bikes stacked behind the home in Rochdale, Lancashire.

Power tools and golf clubs were also seized during the surprising raid.

But despite the scale of the haul, police have no idea who most of the bikes belong to, or where they were taken from.

Bumper find: Police discovered 146 stolen bikes in the back garden of a house in Rochdale, Lancashire

Sergeant Andy Fern from the Rochdale South Neighbourhood Policing Team said they would try and return the bikes to their owners.

And he said that two of the bikes have already found their rightful home.

He said: 'The recovery of these bikes is a
great result for the team and our job now is to find a way of returning
the stolen items to their rightful owners.

Mystery: The bikes were found during a raid at the address and police are working to find their rightful owners

'So far we have had two of the bikes returned after they were stolen during a burglary and this is thanks to the good work of our officers.'

And Sergeant Fern offered advice to cyclists to stop them from being the victim of a similar crime.

He said: 'We are now searching through our databases to be able to return items back to their owners.

'Cyclists can reduce their chances of becoming a victim of crime by locking bikes to something fixed or bulky and using a good standard bicycle lock, even when in a shed or garage.'
