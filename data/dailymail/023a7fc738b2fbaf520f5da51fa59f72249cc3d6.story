Italian superyacht designer Federico Fiorentino has revealed a new concept that could one day be a floating playground for a billionaire and his or her celebrity friends.

The luxury vessel, called The Belafonte, is a superyacht on steroids with a massive bow and striking bronze exterior that catches the sun’s reflection off the sea.

At 164ft in length, the aluminium yacht takes full advantage of its outdoor space, boasting three decks with plenty of room for lounging or partying.

Comfort: The Belafonte has room for up to ten overnight guests who will retire to five luxurious cabins

With room for up to ten overnight guests, the mini-cruise ship has five luxurious cabins, including a large VIP suite, two twin cabins and a double cabin.

The owner will retire to the largest room of all. At nearly 900 square feet, it has a separate studio, balcony, walk-in closets and two bathrooms.

Guests will be pampered by the ship’s crew as they relax in a saloon, outdoor dining area, pool or a shaded sky lounge.

Stunning: The superyacht's top deck has a hot tub, shaded bar and a private area for sunlounging

Renderings of the impressive superyacht show a hot tub surrounded by sunloungers on the top deck, while the spacious middle deck boasts a small pool just steps from a large, circular table for alfresco dining.

The front of the upper deck features a private lounge for sunbathing.

According to the Superyacht Times, the vessel has a top speed between 18 and 24 knots (20 to 27mph), and the Milan-based designer has already garnered interest from a potential buyer.
