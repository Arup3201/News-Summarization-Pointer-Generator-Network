Three dozen college presidents at private colleges and universities made more than $1 million in 2012, with the highest earner bringing home $7.1 million in compensation, according to a survey of the 500 private schools with the largest endowments.

The highest earner was Shirley Ann Jackson at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute based in Troy, New York.

Her compensation included a payout of nearly $5.9 million that had been set aside over a decade as a retention incentive, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education's report released Sunday.

The highest earning private college president is Shirley Ann Jackson at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute based in Troy, New York, who took home total compensation of $7,143,412

The Chronicle finds the median compensation for private college presidents was a little less than $400,000.

1. Shirley Ann Jackson, The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY - $7,143,312 

2. John L. Lahey, Quinnipiac University, Hamden, Conn. - $3,759,076

3. Lee C. Bollinger, Columbia University, New York, NY - $3,389,917

4. Amy Gutmann, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Penn. -$2,473,952

5. Charles R. Middleton, Roosevelt University, Chicago, Ill., $1,762,956 

That's an increase of 2.5 per cent from a year earlier.

A high salary for presidents can be prestigious, but it also opens them up to criticism as tuition prices continue to rise.

Presidents of some of the nation's most prestigious universities didn't hit the million mark but were close.

The presidents of Princeton, Stanford and Harvard had compensation in the $900,000s.

Many presidents who are members of religious orders earned no compensation at Roman Catholic institutions.

The Chronicle's analysis was conducted using tax forms and Education Department filings.

It calculated the annual compensation using base salary, bonuses, other reportable compensation and nontaxable benefits.

It didn't include compensation such as retirement pay set aside for future years but not paid out in 2012, the Chronicle said.

John L. Lahey, of Quinnipiac University, Hamden, Conn., came in second place with $3,759,076

Other college presidents in the top earners were Quinnipiac University's John L. Lahey with total compensation of $3.7 million, Columbia University's Lee C. Bollinger with $3.3 million, and Amy Gutmann at the University of Pennsylvania with $2.4 million.  

Jackson was named president of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1999, the first African American woman appointed to the position.

She is married to Morris A. Washington, a physics professor at the school, and her son Alan is a Dartmouth alumn.  

According to her profile page on the school's site, she also serves on the U.S. Secretary of State’s International Security Advisory Board, the U.S. Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, and the U.S. Comptroller-General’s Advisory Committee for the Government Accountability Office.

He research specialty is in condensed matter physics. 

She has been awarded 52 honorary doctoral degrees and has been praised by Time magazine as 'perhaps the ultimate role model for women in science.'

John L. Lahey, who follows in second place at Connecticut's Quinnipiac University with $3,759,076, took his position in 1987 and is credited with drastically expanding both the school's campus and enrollment numbers, having directed development for two additional campuses.

Third runner up Lee Bollinger at Columbia with $3.38 million began his tenure in 2002 and is identified by the school's site at the longest serving Ivy League president.
