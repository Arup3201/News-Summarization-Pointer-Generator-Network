Barcelona have dismissed Liverpool's claims that they paid £75m for Luis Suarez, insisting they only shelled out £65m for the striker. 

Suarez, who is unavailable to play until late October due to a FIFA ban, was finally unveiled at the Nou Camp on Tuesday.

But while the Premier League side have insisted to Sportsmail that they received the full release clause for the Uruguayan, Barca have been boasting about their bargaining skills.

'Suarez's clause was £75m and in the end we paid £65m thanks to the skill of those negotiating,' executive vice-president Jordi Mestre said.

His new release clause has been set at a whopping £160m, and the 27-year-old admitted he has always had the Catalan giants in his heart.

'For years I've been dreaming of playing for Barca,' Suarez confessed. 'Every little boy knows, this is something that they want, and my family was here as well.

'To come here and watch Barca play and that one day I would be able to play here, I didn't think it was going to happen.

'When the opportunity arose I didn't think twice. It's something I've been dreaming of since I was a little boy.'

Liverpool steadfastly maintain that the fee for Luis Suarez was £75million. 

Suarez is unavailable to play in competitive matches until late October after biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, but made his unofficial debut in a friendly against Club Leon on Monday.
