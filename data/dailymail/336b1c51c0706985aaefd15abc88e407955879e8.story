Julian Bell has been criticised by Tory politicians for owning a £1million home while staying on as a housing association tenant

The leader of one of Ed Miliband’s flagship Labour councils was last night embroiled in a row over claims his family is still living in ‘social housing’ – even though he owns a £1 million house nearby.

Julian Bell, head of Labour-run Ealing Council in West London, has been branded a ‘hypocrite’ after buying a five-bedroom property while staying on as a housing association tenant.

Mr Bell, who is a fierce critic of Coalition cuts and has protested at housing shortages, is now facing demands to explain why part of his family is still in social housing seven years after he bought his home a few hundred yards away.

Tory critics yesterday called on him to surrender the housing association home to ‘people who really need it’.

However, the council leader has insisted his housing arrangements are ‘completely appropriate and transparent’.

Mr Bell, 55, who has claimed his council faces ‘doom’ from Government-imposed cutbacks, has regularly highlighted the need for more ‘affordable’ homes.

But a dossier sent to all Ealing councillors last week accused him of continuing to use a rented home in Acton even though he has a substantial house in the same area.

Records show that Mr Bell and his wife Hermia bought the property in September, 2007 for £585,000. It is now worth about £1 million.

However, instead of giving up their housing association property, the couple, who have four daughters, including television presenter Angellica Bell, have been accused of using both homes.

Friends said that while Mr Bell lives in the home he bought, his wife and mother-in-law are based at the housing association house.

Last night, Tory politicians called on him to give up the home. Greg Stafford, Tory leader in Ealing, said: ‘At the very least, this looks like hypocrisy.

‘The council leader has a moral duty to ensure that social housing goes to people who desperately and genuinely need it.’ Mr Bell last night condemned what he described as ‘unfounded and untrue allegations’ made against his family.

The councillor's family stay at a second property nearby. Mr Bell said he has had to take 'a number of decisions' to enable him to care for other relatives 

But he added: ‘I am keen to make absolutely clear all the arrangements relating to my social housing tenancy with A2Dominion Housing Group are completely appropriate and transparent.

‘Over a number of years, I have had to make a number of decisions regarding my family’s housing situation to enable my wife and I to care for frail and elderly relatives with complex care needs, a situation exacerbated by a number of extremely challenging issues relating to our house move.

‘I have always been completely open with council colleagues throughout what has been a difficult time for my family and I.’

Friends claimed that Mr Bell had been working on adapting his own house to make it ready for a disabled relative to move in.
