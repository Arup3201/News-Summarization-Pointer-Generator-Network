A schoolboy has tragically died after being hit on the head by a bottle thrown across the playground.

Oisin McGrath, 13, was struck while playing football on his lunch break at St Michael's College in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, on Monday afternoon. 

A 17-year-old boy was arrested and later bailed pending further police inquiries into what happened.

'I'll be praying for his family and all those devastated by this sad news tonight.'

Sources at the school said Oisin was playing football with friends when he was hurt. It is believed a water bottle was thrown across the playground and struck the schoolboy on the head.

Local priest Father Seamus Quinn had been at Oisin's bedside along with his devastated family.

He said: 'They are stunned, numb and utterly shocked, with their hearts broken.

'People were shocked when they heard that there were no signs of life and the support would be gradually removed.'

Oisin, a keen sportsman from the village of Belcoo in Fermanagh, was being treated in the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) in Belfast.

Fr Quinn described Oisin as a very well-grounded and well-rounded young teenager, and added: 'He was happy and helpful, genuinely helpful, intelligent young fellow.

'They are a well-loved and well-respected family, they are solid, salt of the earth people, faith-based people, Christian people.'

He said the community in Belcoo had been united in prayer for Oisin, with 500 people attending Catholic Mass on Wednesday night at St Patrick's Church in nearby Holywell, a small village outside Belcoo.

Fr Quinn added: 'There is a silence in the village, there was a silence after Mass last night, naturally people were just dumbfounded and in shock.

'For anybody who has children it is their worst nightmare.'

Closed: St Michael's College in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, where the incident happened, will be closed on Friday 'in the light of the tragic events this week and the impact on the school community'

The teenager played Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) football in Belcoo. His mother Sharon is secretary in the local club.

Paul McGrath, coach of the Belcoo under-14 side, described Oisin as a 'good, quiet lad'.

Fr Quinn had earlier told how Oisin's mother Sharon had spoken of her sympathy for the other youth's parents.

He said: 'I heard his mother saying there was some other poor family suffering at the moment. She said that yesterday. She was very concerned about Oisin's friends too.

'I would echo that myself. Our hearts go out to anybody else involved in this if there was some sort of accident. Nobody sets out to do this; it was obviously an accident of some description.'  

St Michael's is a Catholic boys' grammar school with 700 pupils, and a statement from the school said: 'A group of students were playing at lunchtime when one student became unwell and we sought medical assistance.'

A notice on St Michael's College website said it would be closed on Friday  'in the light of the tragic events this week and the impact on the school community'.
