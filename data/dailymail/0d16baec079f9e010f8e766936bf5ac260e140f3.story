In the quest to make us slimmer without lifting a finger, an injection has been invented letting us literally pee out our fat.

A water solution is injected into stubborn areas around the body, breaking down excess fat cells, allowing us to absorb them into our bloodstream - and then wee them out.

The new treatment, dubbed Aqualyx, claims to be an effective alternative to liposuction.

It contains plant polymers, which binds with the cell walls of the fat tissue before rupturing and releasing the fat to be dissolved.

The formula liquefies the fat cell which is then eliminated when you urinate over a three-week period.

Makers say the solution completely destroys the fat cells so they can’t grow back.

It can be used on your thighs, stomach, knees, chin, buttocks, stomach, back and even your neck.

Describing its new treatment, Mills Medical Service say it 'gives you the body you’ve always dreamed of without fearing the fat will return'.

The treatment, which claims to be the only registered fat removal injection on the market, says it has no downtime (other than slight bruising and swelling for 48 hours).

'Aqualyx isn’t an injection for weight loss; it is used for contouring the body and slimming down those stubborn fat areas. Combined with a healthy diet and exercise, the fat won’t grow back either.' say the brand.

One session costs £250, which Mills Medical say is all that's needed for the chin area, while the tummy may need a few more treatments.

But is it all too good to be true - can it really be effective and safe?

Dr Arun Ghosh, from the private Spire Hospital in Liverpool says the injections could pose a health risk.

He told the Daily Star: 'It's dangerous to re-absorb fatty acids into your bloodstream because if it's dissolved down into salt it would send cholesterol levels sky high.'

Dr Yannis Alexandrides, MD of 111 
Harley Street, said: 'I don’t use fat removal injectable in my clinic 
and certainly have no plans to until there is further research and 
trials published.

'It’s 
always important that prospective patients thoroughly research 
treatments before they book, and these injectables are very new to the 
market with little evidence of their efficacy other than that produced 
by the manufacturer.

'While
 the cost is certainly affordable and attractive, those thinking of 
having the procedure must look at alternatives available that have 
proven results and existing patient testimonials.

'Also, prospective patients must undergo a full consultation to determine the right procedure for their concern.'
