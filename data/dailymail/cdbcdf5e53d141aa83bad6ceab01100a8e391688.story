Everton manager Roberto Martinez has followed the lead of his Merseyside rival Brendan Rodgers and told England manager Roy Hodgson to handle his star youngster Ross Barkley with care.

Despite saying 20-year-old Barkley was ‘born to play football’ after his triumphant comeback against Aston Villa at Goodison Park on Saturday, Martinez is already laying down a marker ahead of next month when England face Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier and a hostile friendly in Scotland.

Just as Rodgers has regularly warned against Raheem Sterling ‘burn-out’ and didn’t want him to play 180 minutes against San Marino and Estonia, Martinez is also advising caution with Barkley, who returned on Saturday for the first time since damaging knee ligaments in pre-season.

The Spaniard knows that England coach Ray Lewington, who was at Goodison to watch, will have reported back to Hodgson with enthusiasm after Barkley played a part in Everton’s first two goals. 

‘We need to be careful with Ross and Sterling,’ said Martinez. ‘Yes, England will want him in the next squad, but Ross still can’t play 90 minutes and we will have to see how long it takes for him to do that.

‘He’s been out for 14 weeks so we need to be careful. We have six games in three weeks (at Everton) so we need to give what the players needs.

‘With young players and England there needs to be a process to learn what is expected. Look at Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka, they took it to a different level when they got the knowledge.

‘It is understandable that the young players go through those experiences before they can win games for England.’

The problem for Martinez is he can’t avoid talking up the midfielder himself, hailing him as a rare talent who can combine technical and physical excellence.

It was Barkley’s stinging shot which forced the corner from which Jagielka scored Everton’s opener against Aston Villa after 18 minutes.

Barkley then fed Romelu Lukaku for the second goal after 48 minutes, though Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan will feel he should have done better.

Seamus Coleman wrapped up the points after 76 minutes after Barkley had already left the field to a standing ovation from the Goodison Park crowd.

‘It’s hard to explain how Ross could come back with a performance like that. It should have been impossible for him to start against Villa, but he trains so hard, he’s just a natural,’ said Martinez.

‘He just loves playing football, and you see that and in a way he had to play.’

Manchester City, who are short of top-class homegrown players, would be prepared to pay big money to take him to The Etihad so perhaps it wasn’t particularly wise for Martinez to add: ‘The bigger the game, the more you get from him.’

But the comparison with another Merseyside street footballer, Wayne Rooney, was apt. ‘There are similarities 100 per cent. Sometimes we have to drag Ross away from training because at the end he’s in the two v two with the young kids, and he loves it.

Belgium international Romelu Lukaku was also among the scorers in Everton's 3-0 win against Aston Villa

‘We take him away because he doesn’t see the energy it takes out of his body. He approaches the game in that manner and that’s his biggest strength.’

Everton started the weekend just outside the bottom three without a win in five games. But their performance on Saturday suggests they will start climbing rapidly from now onwards although their next challenge is a Europa League trip to Lille on Thursday.

Martinez will also have been pleased to see £28million record signing Lukaku notch his third goal of the season after an awkward start to the season for the giant Belgian.

Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert is in the unusual position of hankering after Philippe Senderos after their capitulation at Goodison.

Senderos, much-maligned during his career at Arsenal and Fulham, picked up a thigh injury on international duty with Switzerland and Villa flopped without him.

‘We missed Senderos because he has been excellent,’ admitted Lambert. ‘Hopefully he will be back for our next game against QPR.

Skipper Ron Vlaar did return after a calf problem though the Villa boss thinks it will take a couple of weeks before he finds his top form again.
