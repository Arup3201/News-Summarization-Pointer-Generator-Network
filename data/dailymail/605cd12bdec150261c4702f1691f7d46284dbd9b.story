Arrested: Angel Garcia, 55, pictured, has been arrested after he allegedly abducted Brooklyn Gittins, 13, last week

A 55-year-old Utah man has been arrested after he allegedly abducted a 13-year-old girl who vanished from her home last week without shoes or a coat and emerged two days later unharmed.

Salt Lake County Sheriff James Winder described Angel Garcia, from Draper, as a predator in the 'complicated' case of Brooklyn Gittins, who disappeared overnight on January 8 wearing just her pajamas.

After an extensive search stretching two days and involving more than 1,000 volunteers, the young Herriman girl called her grandmother from a Wal-Mart store and police picked her up.

Garcia was taken into custody on 
Wednesday night and is being held at Salt Lake County Jail on suspicion 
of child kidnapping, harboring a runaway, obstructing justice and child 
endangerment.

Winder 
wouldn't give details about how Garcia knew Brooklyn, but told the Salt 
Lake City Tribune there was 'an association between common friends.'

He said police were not looking for any other suspects, and cautioned against speculation about the victim.

'I
don't want to characterize young Brooklyn's actions here, and I don't 
think anybody else should either,' Winder told the newspaper.

'What
we have to look at here is the suspect, who has in no uncertain terms 
behaved in a predatory fashion relative to a young member of our 
community.'

Found: Brooklyn Gittins, 13, who went missing 
Tuesday night after going to bed in her house, was found unharmed, police said Friday

Scene: Police say there is no sign of forced entry at her home in Herriman, Utah

The sheriff reiterated that the 13-year-old was not physically harmed during the alleged abduction.

He
said that Garcia was aware of the wide-spread hunt for Brooklyn while 
she was missing and that there was a 'significant' amount of 
premeditation involved in the plan. It's still unclear where Garcia 
allegedly took Brooklyn.

'The locations are still being tracked down, but we believe there were several,' Winder told the Tribune.

Police revealed last Friday that Brooklyn Gittins had been found unharmed.

More to the story: Police suspect that Brooklyn, pictured, was harbored by Angel Garcia and are trying to find out where she was kept

Brooklyn
telephoned her grandmother late on Thursday night from a Wal-Mart store
in South Jordan, Unified Police spokesman Lieutenant Justin Hoyal said.

The grandmother then contacted police and officers located the child.

'Brooklyn was not injured and is 
fine,' Hoyal said last week. 'She was still wearing the grey T-shirt and
black pajama pants. She did not have on shoes, a coat.'

Authorities were quick to suspect that the teen was harbored by someone and immediately focused on identifying that person.

She disappeared on Tuesday evening wearing only pajamas and a t-shirt. It was not be the first time that Brooklyn ran away so her parents feared that she had done so again.

A
major snowstorm on Thursday prompted some 1,000 volunteers to join 
police in searching 17 square miles in the area near the girl's home in 
Herriman, a Salt Lake City suburb about 18 miles southwest of downtown.

A
key concern had been the frigid winter weather. 'Investigators believed
she could have been a victim of the elements; it's been extremely 
cold,' he said.

The storm was expected to dump as much as 7 inches of snow and bring freezing temperatures.

Police, who used canine units, a 
helicopter, and on-the-ground volunteers to canvas the nearby areas to find Brooklyn, interviewed the child after she was found, trying to determine where she was.

There were no signs of forced entry at the Herriman home where Brooklyn was last seen at bedtime on Tuesday.

'We believe she left her home through her bedroom window and was picked up and harbored by a person or persons,' Hoyal told The Associated Press in an interview.

Winder said on Thursday before she was found that the circumstances surrounding the case concerned authorities, especially because it appeared her departure was unplanned.

Brooklyn's grandfather Craig Hiller made a plea at the news conference for her to come back.

He said she's a typical teenage girl who is very outgoing in some cases and very subdued in others.

The first time she ran away, she came back a short while later, Hiller said.

He said at the time that he could not think of any clear 
reason why she would have run away. There were no arguments in their 
family of late and her friends did not know of any plans that she had to
disappear, he said.

To many locals, the search for Brooklyn had echoes of 
Elizabeth Smart's horrific 2002 kidnapping, which took place nearly 30 
miles away. However, that abduction had a clear suspect.

Fortunately for her and her family, Brooklyn did not endure the same fate.

'This was a successful investigation and we appreciate all the efforts by the community, public safety personnel, and the media in response to Brooklyn's disappearance,' Hoyal said.
