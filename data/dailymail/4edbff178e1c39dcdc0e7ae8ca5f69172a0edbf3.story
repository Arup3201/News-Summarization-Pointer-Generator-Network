A Democratic candidate for Arizona governor has ignited controversy after releasing a photo of himself with darkened skin and a beard to make himself look like the character in Dos Equis beer commercials. 

Critics say the photo is an attempt by the candidate, Fred DuVal to 'look more Hispanic,' the Arizona Daily Independent reported.

But DuVal says it was a joke response to the Arizona Republican Party's attempts to label him as the 'the most uninteresting man in the world.'

Fred DuVal, a Democratic candidate for Arizona governor, has ignited controversy after releasing this photo of himself with darkened skin and a beard to make himself look like the character in Dos Equis beer commercials

DuVal says the photo was a joke response to the Arizona Republican Party's attempts to label him as the 'the most uninteresting man in the world'

The GOP applied that label in an ad that criticizes the state's Democratic Party for being unable to 'find candidates that people can relate to.'

DuVal responded by delivering a case of Dos Equis beer to two Republican leaders with what he called a 'tongue-in-cheek thank-you card' that put a twist on Dos Equis' ad campaign featuring 'the most interesting man in the world.'

The card featured the message: 'Stay desperate, my friends,' over a picture of a darker-skinned DuVal attempting to imitate Jonathan Goldsmith's Latino DosEquis character.

'Honestly, I was flattered the Republican Party decided to target me a full year before the election,' DuVal said.

'But instead of responding to their insult negatively I wanted to show them that I am a good sport and will bring a new spirit of cooperation to the state capital when I am elected governor,' he added.

In response, the Arizona GOP said: 'DuVal digitally morphed himself to resemble the person pictured here, put the doctored image out on Twitter and hand-delivered a printed copy to the AZGOP. Painful attempts at humor, especially with racial overtones, usually backfire on candidates.'

The Arizona GOP's remarks were reported by the Arizona Daily Independent.

DuVal says the controversy has helped him raise $11,000 for his campaign.
