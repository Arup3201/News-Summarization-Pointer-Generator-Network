Darren Fletcher may have to consider a move away from Manchester United this January after falling down the pecking order for club and country.

The United midfielder has made only three Barclays Premier League starts for his club this season and has made only two substitute appearances totalling 26 minutes since the end of August.

Meanwhile the popular Scot has slipped out of his national team, too.

Fletcher, who will be 31 in the New Year, has a chance of playing in Tuesday night’s friendly against England at Celtic Park but, crucially, was not in the starting line-up when Gordon Strachan’s team beat the Republic of Ireland in their Euro 2016 qualifier in Glasgow last Friday.

Having recovered from the bowel condition that threatened his career three years ago, Fletcher has been fit all season after United manager Louis van Gaal made him vice-captain in the summer. Indeed Fletcher’s team-mates have praised his efforts in training and his general fitness.

'He doesn't miss a training session,' said United skipper Wayne Rooney on Monday.

Fletcher has also fallen down the Scotland pecking order under Gordon Strachan 

'He trains really hard, so I'm really pleased he's managed to come through.

'He's back fit and ready to play.'

Fletcher is known as a great professional and character to have round the dressing room at Old Trafford. Indeed he was in good spirits at the Scotland camp at Mar Hall outside Glasgow.

Nevertheless he has not been offered the opportunity to impact on United’s season by Van Gaal since the end of summer.

Fletcher started United’s first three Premier League games – against Swansea, Sunderland and Burnley – after impressing Van Gaal on the club’s pre-season tour of America.

However, he has only made two substitute appearances in the league since new players arrived in the transfer window and has not been able to force himself into the team even in light of United’s injury problems.

Fletcher is out of contract at the end of the season and may wish to see what his options are as a free agent rather than leave the club in the January window.

The United star may also be granted a rare start in Van Gaal’s team at Arsenal this weekend as fellow midfielders Daley Blind and Michael Carrick have both picked up injuries on international duty.
