The makers of a documentary about Edward Snowden have been sued in the US by a retired naval officer who is demanding that they give up the £1.4m box office earnings.

Horace Edwards says that those behind 'Citizenfour' should hand over the cash to the American government because the movie profited from stolen information.

Mr Edwards says that Mr Snowden breached his duty of confidentiality on matters of national security and his lawsuit seeks restitution on behalf of the American people.

The papers, filed at the US District Court in Kansas, seek to address what they call the 'unjust enrichment' of filmmaker Laura Poitras, who produced 'Citizenfour'.

The documentary tells the story of how Mr Snowden leaked vast amounts of data about the National Security Agency whilst working as a government IT contractor in the biggest intelligence security breach in US history.

Miss Poitras followed him in Hong Kong and Russia as he met with reporters from The Guardian newspaper to tell them his story.

The Guardian is not named in the lawsuit but Mr Snowden is along with the Weinstein Company, the film company owned by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.

It says Mr Snowden's behaviour was 'morally wrongful' and 'dishonourable and indefensible and not the acts of a legitimate whistleblower'.

Miss Poitras is criticised for 'hiding (Snowden) in her hotel room while he changes into light disguise, accepting all of the purloined information to use for her personal benefit financially and professionally'.

The lawsuit lambasts all concerned for 'aiding and abetting the theft and misuse of stolen government documents'.

In addition to the £1.4 million earned at the cinema since its release in October, Citizenfour has also been sold to HBO in the US and Channel 4 in the UK.

Mr Snowden is currently in Russia where he has been granted extended asylum.
