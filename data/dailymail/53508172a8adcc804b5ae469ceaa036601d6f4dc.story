Amid labour disputes and onboard fights among flight attendants American Airlines can add a new troubling highlight to their list: more delays and cancellations than any of the five biggest U.S. airlines.

With only 44.5 per cent of their flights arriving on time between Sunday and Wednesday this week according to FlightStats.com, four per cent or 293 of American Airlines' flights were also cancelled.

That's a sharp contrast when compared to the other four biggest airlines in the U.S., with the second worst for delays going to United - which has just 20.2 per cent of their flights delayed.

Complaints: Over 200 American Airline pilots marched on a picket line at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Thursday, one day after a grim report revealing they've had more delays and cancellations than any other

Delta, Southwest and U.S. Airways all saw an average of 85 per cent of their flights arriving on time or approximately 15 per cent delayed.

With a declining job performance the airline, whose parent company has filed for bankruptcy protection, has captured the Federal Aviation Administration's attention, expanding ramp checks and fly-alongs with their pilots.

American, coming to their own defence, in a statement to ABC claims their pilots are to blame.

'The recent disruptions are primarily due to the significant increase in maintenance write-ups by our pilots, many right at the time of departure,' American said.

But according to the Allied Pilots Association which represents American Airline's 10,000 pilots, there is no significant increase.

'We have verified that pilot sick rates have not deviated from normal historical rates,' the union told ABC. 'We have likewise verified that crew cancellations remain at normal rates.'

On Thursday, however, about 200 members of the union picketed outside Chicago's O'Hare International Airport protesting recent pay and benefit cuts.

The airline now expects to cancel up to 2 per cent of its total flights through the end of October because of the disputes.

Even if passengers find other flights, it's a setback for American, which is struggling to reverse years of heavy losses.

American Airlines has faced a barrage of criticism from the media and consumer advocates alike lately, notably after a scuffle between two stewardesses that caused a four-hour flight delay on Wednesday.

Included in FlightStats delay report this week, the flight out of New York City's JFK Airport to Washington, D.C. had to return to the gate after the women fought over a cell phone in a fight that was broadcast to passengers over the intercom.

A day earlier The Wall Street Journal's veteran travel reporter, Scott McCartney, urged travellers to avoid the financially troubled carrier stating: 'American's operation is in shambles.'
