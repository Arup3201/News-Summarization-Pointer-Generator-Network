It is a glass-walled palace that is so open you can see what is going on in the bedrooms.

But now Calvin Klein appears to be having second thoughts about privacy at his $75m Hamptons mansion - and is taking steps to keep the public away.

The designer has put up signs warning about poison ivy and ticks around the property, which has taken three years to build and is finally nearly completion.

People in glass mansions: Calvin Klein has nearly finished his $75M glass-walled Hamptons mansion but may be second-guessing his revealing choices

Southern exposure: The 'minimalist' Hamptons beachfront home has elicited gawkin geven from billionaire neighbors and Klein has put up a modest screen in front of his shower that was once exposed to the street

He has also employed security guards to patrol the area and installed cameras to keep watch on the throngs who have been coming to gawk at the home.

The reason is supposedly that Klein appears to be having a rethink about how much of his private life he wants to show off.

He built the stunning minimalist mansion with floor to ceiling glass so that even the shower was visible to the public until he put up a modesty screen.

According to a recent piece in the New York Times, even from the road the ‘figure of a wiry man with spiky hair and a white T-shirt’ - Klein - could easily be seen going about his business inside.

See-through: Klein has posted Do Not Enter signs that warn of poison ivy and ticks as well as guards to shoo away nosy billionaire neighbors eager to peak at the transparent spectacle

The original idea was that the mansion would be ‘naturalistic’ and blend in with the surroundings which, in this case, is the beach and the dunes on an exclusive part of Southampton, New York.

Now, however, the New York Post reported that signs around the property have been put up which read: ‘Caution, Poison Ivy and Ticks present: Do Not Enter.’

The security guards have been fitted with white shirts and black trousers and patrol all over the property.

Decadent: Calvin Klein has a history of real estate indulgence. He once bought an unfinished Manhattan penthouse then flew a helicopter to where his windows would be to assess his future view

Some also stand at the end of the driveway to stop curious passers-by from peeking in.

Part of the reason for the increased security measures is that Klein’s house is finally nearing completion and has become the talk of The Hamptons, no mean feat when other residents include Paul McCartney and Alec Baldwin.

On the same stretch of sand the neighbors include David and Julia Koch and hotelier Ian Schrager.

This summer Bill and Hillary Clinton also moved into a $200,000 a week rental home in Sagaponack, a short drive further East.

Klein spends six days a week in the property and has supposedly personally vetted every single object inside.

Every room has sliding doors so that the space can be reorganized at his whim.

There are white sofas in every room, Danish-made chairs by Poul Kjaerholm, vintage furniture by Le Corbusier, an infinity pool and a neighboring building he plans to use as a screening room - it is joined to the main house by an underground passageway.

During the construction process Klein
built a life-size mock up of the property made of plywood which needed 
its own building permits and cost some $350,000 all on its own.

The
castle that once stood on the property has an extremely colorful 
history - it used to be owned by the tycoon Henry du Pont but after his 
death it was bought by Leonard Holzer and his wife Jane, who became 
famous for partying with Andy Warhol in the 1970s.

In
the 1980s the house was owned by financier Barry Trupin who enraged the
locals when he taped a 24-karat gold mezuzah to the front door.

Once upon a time: A castle once stood on the property, but Klein tore it down to build his glass house. The extravagant mansion featured an indoor shark tank and waterfall

Residents branded it ‘a Disney castle on LSD’, not least because of the indoor shark tank and the 20ft waterfall out the back.

Klein bought it in 2003 for $30m and later had it all knocked down.

According to the New York Times, his obsession with perfection fits with a pattern of taking real estate extremely seriously.

When Klein bought a triplex penthouse in the South Tower of the Richard Meier building in Manhattan in 2000, one of the first things he did was fly in a helicopter to where his windows were going to be to get a look at what his view would be like.

A spokesman for Klein said he ‘always has had security at his houses over the years.’

The spokesman said: ‘Yes, there are signs warning of ticks because the deer are rampant out here and people are warning of late of the grave danger Lyme disease presents to anyone exposed’.
