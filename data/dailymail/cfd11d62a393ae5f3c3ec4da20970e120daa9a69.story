An idyllic abbey which was once the home of a number of scandalous orgies involving politicians and aristocrats has been put up for sale for £10million.

Medmenham Abbey, in Buckinghamshire, is a beautiful riverside mansion with stunning gardens and luxury accommodation, which was once the meeting place for a secret society.

In the early 18th Century Francis Dashwood, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, founded the ‘Brotherhood of the Knights of St Francis of Wycombe’ club.

Also known as The Hellfire Club, it was a secret society of 24 members - known as the monks of Medmenham - who dressed in gowns and turbans before engaging in acts of debauchery.

In the early 18th Century Francis Dashwood, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, founded the ‘Brotherhood of the Knights of St Francis of Wycombe’ club at the abbey which he owned, and the 24 members of the club would dress in gowns  before engaging in acts of debauchery

Despite its scandalous history, which included women prostitutes dressing as nuns before pleasuring the members of the society, the property is now up for sale for a staggering £10milllion and has been described as a 'fantastic family home'. Pictured: The bar area in a living room

The property has been transformed over the years and now boasts nine bedrooms, cinema (pictured), library, spa, gym, music room and a bar

The abbey, which comes complete with a spa including a Jacuzzi and steam room (pictured), is on the market for a whopping £10million

Legend has it that the members would dress prostitutes and open-minded ladies of societies as nuns and demand they pleasure the 'monks'.

Members of the society included the likes of the Marquis of Granby, the Earl of Bute, John Wilkes, Thomas Potter, who was the Archbishop of Canterbury's son, and the Earl of Sandwich.

The sordid days of Medmenham Abbey are now long gone and the property has been transformed into a 'historic and fantastic family home'.

With 42 acres of land and gardens which have been beautifully cared for, the abbey is nestled in the heart of the English countryside and looks out onto the River Thames.

The property was originally built on the site of a 13th century Cistercian abbey but was redeveloped by Italian designers in the 18th century at the request of Mr Dashwood.

Today, the main house boasts nine bedroom suites, a cinema, library, music room and drawing room along with a spa, gymnasium and bar.

With 42 acres of land and gardens which have been beautifully cared for, the abbey is just a stones throw from a long stretch of the Thames

With an asking price of £10million, the property is by far and away the most expensive home currently on the market in Buckinghamshire

James Crawford, from Knight Frank Country estate agents, said: 'I would say it was one of the finest most important homes in the area'

The estate also features a cottage for a housekeeper, long, extensive offices and a three-bay garage. In total, there is around 12,000sq/ft of living space.

The stunning home has been put onto the market as an entire estate for the first time in decades.

With an asking price of £10million, it makes it by far and away the most expensive home currently for sale in Buckinghamshire.

James Crawford, from Knight Frank Country estate agents, said: 'It is very unusual to have this extent of river frontage, particularly as there are no other properties on the other side. It is very private.

'It is halfway between Henley and Marlow which are both lovely towns so you can buzz up and down to visit shops and restaurants.

'The abbey is historic. There was once a group of men who called themselves, tongue in cheek, the 'Brotherhood of the Knights of St Francis of Wycombe'.

The property is nestled in 42 acres of the Buckinghamshire countryside but is still situated between just 45 minutes and an hour from London

The property overlooks a large stretch of the River Thames and comes with 42 acres of land as well as beautifully-manicured gardens

In total, the entire estate - which has gone on the market for the first time in decades - boasts around 12,000sq/ft of luxurious living space

John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich (left), was reportedly a member of The Hellfire Club, which would meet regularly at the abbey (right) and hold scandalous parties. Also up for sale is a small cottage in the grounds of the estate which once accommodated the housekeeper

'They would dress up and have parties. I'm not sure what exactly they got up to back then but there was a plaque over the building saying 'fay ce que voudras', which means 'do what you will'.

'But it is now a fantastic modern home. There is a new kitchen, new bathrooms and a cinema.

'It is rare to find a home like this that has 42 acres and is very peaceful but is 45 minutes to an hour from London.

'I would say it was one of the finest most important homes in the area. It is a one-off and I expect there will be a lot of interest.'

Sir Francis Dashwood depicted in a portrait by William Hogarth in the late 1750s

Sir Francis Dashwood was a British politician who served as the Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1762 until 1763.

He was born in Great Marlborough Street, in London, in 1708 to Sir Francis Dashwood, 1st Baronet, and his second wife Mary, the eldest daughter of Vere Fane, 4th Earl of Westmorland.

He attended the prestigious Eton College and when his father died in 1724, Sir Dashwood inherited the family estate and Baronetcy of Dashwood of West Wycombe title. He was just 15-years-old.

As he grew up, he reportedly became friends with John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich.

In the mid-1700s, Sir Dashwood founded The Hellfire Club and the first meeting of the group – which was also known as the Brotherhood of the Knights of St Francis of Wycombe - was held at his family home in West Wycombe.

The initial meeting was deemed something of a failure and the club subsequently moved their meetings to Medmenham Abbey, where they called themselves the 'Monks of Medmenham'.

The 24 members of the secret society retreated to the idyllic abbey every summer and carried out acts of debauchery including scandalous orgies with female prostitutes dressed as nuns.

Following his time with The Hellfire Club, Sir Dashwood was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in June 1762.

Just a year earlier, he had found a new seat in Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis.

He resigned from his position as Chancellor after just a year, following a disappointing Budget speech which was said to be ‘confused and incapable’.

He later retreated from the limelight and passed away at his West Wycombe residency after a long illness in December 1781. He was buried, alongside his wife who died in 1769, at a mausoleum which he had built on the estate.
