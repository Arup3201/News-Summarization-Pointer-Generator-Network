Councils are being forced to slash millions from school maintenance budgets to pay for Nick Clegg’s controversial plan to provide free school meals to all infant children, a report warns today.

The Local Government Association (LGA) says that councils will be left more than £25million out of pocket as a result of the policy championed by the Liberal Democrat leader.

The LGA report also warns that the plan, which comes into force next month, could have an impact on learning in some schools because lunch times may have to be extended to cope with demand, leaving less time for lessons.

David Simmonds, the chairman of the LGA’s children and young people board, said that while free school meals could have benefits for children, councils were being forced to raid other parts of the schools budget to pay for them.

Mr Simmonds said: ‘Councils and schools have been working really hard to make this happen within this ambitious timescale. But it cannot be right that for some councils, money set aside for maintenance has instead had to be spent plugging the shortfall in money which government should have provided for meals.

‘This research makes it clear central government has not provided schools with enough money to do the essential work necessary to give 1.5 million children a free meal at lunchtime. It is councils and schools who are picking up the bill for this work, at a time when budgets are already squeezed and tough decisions are being taken.’

A survey of 150 major local authorities found that half of those responding had been forced to subsidise the free school meal programme. The average bill was just under £500,000.

Councils responding to the survey reported spending £25.8million of their own cash to prepare for the introduction of the policy at the start of the new school year. But the true figure is likely to be far higher as only half of those contacted responded to the survey.

Church schools, which have to fund 10 per cent of all capital projects from their own funds, are said to have been hit particularly hard. The findings will fuel criticism of Mr Clegg for pressing ahead with the eye-catching announcement at last year’s Lib Dem conference before detailed work had been done on the practicalities and likely costs.

The decision led to a furious row with the then Education Secretary Michael Gove who was charged with trying to make the policy work. Aides to Mr Gove said Mr Clegg pressed ahead with the plan despite warnings it was unaffordable.

Labour’s education spokesman Tristram Hunt said: ‘Hard-pressed schools and councils are being forced to bail out the Government because of its own incompetence. Nick Clegg announced the policy without doing the maths first.’

A total of £150million was set aside to pay for improvements such as new kitchens and extended dining areas. But councils have warned the money underestimated the true cost.

Today’s report warns that despite the extra spending some schools will only be able to provide packed lunches and others will be forced to deploy portable kitchens.

A Lib Dem spokesman said last night it was right to make free school meals a priority.

He said: ‘Free school meals are good for children’s attainment, make sure they eat more healthy food, and will save parents money. That’s why the Liberal Democrats are proud to be delivering them in government and we believe councils should prioritise them too.’
