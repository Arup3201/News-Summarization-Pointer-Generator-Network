A Texas weatherman said the man who fired 13 bullets at him outside the TV station where he works never said a word to him.

Patrick Crawford, the morning meteorologist at Waco's KCEN-TV, was struck twice in the abdomen and arm when the unidentified man opened fire on Wednesday.

'There was no interaction,' Crawford said at a press conference Monday while in a wheelchair. 'He just started shooting at me as I was leaving the parking lot.'

Good condition: Patrick Crawford, a Texas meteorologist, spoke Monday and said the man who fired 13 shots at him outside his TV station did not have an interaction with him before the shooting

Initial reports from police stated that the man exchanged words with Crawford before he shot him in the parking lot.

Crawford said his main focus is to 'get better, get healthy and get home' from Baylor Scott and White Memorial Hospital and hopes details he gave to police will lead to the suspect.

'Hopefully, that description is going to help bring this person to justice for what he did,' Crawford said.

A composite sketch of the shooter was released by police on Thursday, leading to more than 100 calls to Texas Rangers and other law enforcement officials, Fox News reports. 

There has been no motive uncovered for the shooting and police are offering $10,000 for information leading to the arrest of the suspect. 

Falls County Crime Stoppers originally offered a reward of $5,000 for information, but KCEN-TV reports an anonymous donor contributed an additional $5,000 and the station added $10,000.

Shooting: Police said 13 rounds were fired 

After the shooting, Crawford drove away from the shooter and to a highway construction crew that assisted him by calling 911.

The meteorologist underwent surgery, and trauma surgeon Dr Travis Isbell stated he was 'doing very well' and was an 'ideal patient.'
