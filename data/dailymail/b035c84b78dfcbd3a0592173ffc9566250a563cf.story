Japan and North Korea are to meet tomorrow to continue talks over 17 people abducted by secretive communist state in the late 1970s .

North Korea admitted snatching the Japanese citizens from the street before smuggling them to special espionage camps in the dictatorship.

Pyongyang wanted to train the victims as spies and return them to Japan as agents.

Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said he hoped to be able to resolve the issue after North Korea agreed to re-open talks.

He said: 'The Japanese government believes it is important that their special investigation committee is vested with authority to conduct a probe into all institutions, and that the investigation will actually get started.

'From this standpoint, we plan to carefully assess North Korea's explanation during this upcoming meeting.'

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe admitted that he might even visit North Korea in a bid to help the situation. 

The meeting will take place in Beijing.

Five of the victims have already been returned to their families in Japan.

North Korea claimed that eight of the victims had died although Japan suspects there were additional victims who have not yet been acknowledged. 

North Korea has appointed a 'special investigations committee' to probe the abductions. 

Family members of the missing people met over the weekend to discuss their reaction to the course.

Victims' spokesman Shigeo Lizuka told The Japan Times: 'This time, I think, North Korea will not cheat us.'

The talks come as North Korea inspected test launches of missiles and rockets. The tests were watched by Kim Jong-un.
