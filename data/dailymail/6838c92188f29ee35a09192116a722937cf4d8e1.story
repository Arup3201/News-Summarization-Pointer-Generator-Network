Initiative: David Cameron today visited the Mini factory in Oxford to launch new plans to boost the skills of British young people

Eastern Europeans find it so easy to get jobs in Britain because many of our young people are not ‘fully capable’ of holding down work, David Cameron has said.

The Prime Minister said the UK needs to ‘say no’ to the current situation, which sees half of workers in many factories coming from abroad.

Poor training and school standards mean young Britons do not have the skills and qualifications to compete, he said.

He told apprentices at a Mini factory  in Oxfordshire he did not blame ‘hard-working’ Eastern Europeans for travelling here, nor employers for hiring them.

But because our education system has failed many school-leavers and the welfare  system has not incentivised work, Britons are often a cut below other workers, he said. ‘Immigration, welfare and education are totally linked,’ said Mr Cameron.

‘You go round factories in our country and half the people have come from Poland or Lithuania or Latvia. You can’t blame them. They work hard.

‘They see the jobs, they come over and they do them. But as a country what we ought to be saying is “no”.’

He said: ‘Let’s get our education system right so we are producing young people out of our schools and colleges who are fully capable of doing the jobs. Second, let’s reform the welfare system so that it doesn’t pay to be out of work. And third, let’s have sensible controls on immigration.

‘Crack those three problems together and we’ll create an economy that really generates wealth for all our people.’

The comments come weeks after London Mayor Boris Johnson backed chef Jamie Oliver, who suggested many young Britons were ‘lazy’ and ‘wet behind the ears’.

Speech: The Prime Minister said he did not blame foreign workers for coming to the UK to look for jobs

And this summer, civil society minister Nick Hurd said some young people lacked the ‘grit’ and social skills to get a job.

Yesterday,
skills minister Matt Hancock said: ‘We have a record number of jobs in 
this country and we’ve got to make sure that as people leave school, 
they are in a position to take those jobs.

‘And likewise employers should look at
local young people. I don’t blame the employers at all – my job is to 
make sure that young people have got what it takes.’

He
said a recent study showed Britain was ‘the only country in the world 
where 65-year-olds have better skills than those who have left school in
the last few years’.

Scheme: Mr Cameron is seeking to promote apprenticeships to help British workers' prospects

Mr 
Cameron defended the Government’s controversial work experience scheme, 
in which people do internships in return for benefits.

He
said: ‘Getting people into the workplace, giving them experience of 
work, of timekeeping and all the things it means to have a job is a 
really good way to help get people started.’ He added: ‘The danger for a
country like Britain is yes, you see the economy recover, yes you see 
jobs coming, but you leave behind people who have not got the right 
qualifications from school.

‘I don’t want that to happen in our country.’

The
Prime Minister spoke as more than 60 leading firms – including Mini’s 
owners BMW, BAE Systems, Microsoft and Barclays Bank – signed up to 
deliver new, tougher apprenticeship schemes, which will last at least a 
year and include maths and English tests.

Downing
Street said all new apprenticeships should meet the standards by 
2017/18, while intensive vocational training will be offered to those 
for whom apprenticeships are not the best option.

Accenture, BAE Systems, Barclays, BT, Centrica, Diageo, G

SK, HSBC, Kingfisher, M&S, National Grid, Tesco, Unilever and WPP will start new vocational schemes.
