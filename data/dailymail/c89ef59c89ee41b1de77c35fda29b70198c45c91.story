A fire in the window of a charity shop on Christmas morning was started by sunlight refracting through a snow globe.

The rays ignited fake reindeer food and fake snow that were on display in the British Heart Foundation shop on Wimborne Road, Bournemouth, Dorset.

The incident prompted the fire services to warn members of the public to 'be vigilant' if they have snow globes on display in their homes.

Warning: Fire services warned Britons to be 'vigilant' if they had snow globes in their homes

Occupants of neighbouring properties on the busy shopping road were advised to evacuate as firefighters from Dorset Fire Service fought the flames. 

A fire service spokesman said that the incident sounded like a 'Christmas tale'. 

He said: 'At the risk of sounding like a Christmas tale, the cause of the fire was believed to be sun refracting through a snow globe in the shop window which then ignited "reindeer food" and fake snow material in their window display.

'There was severe fire damage to the shop window display, heat damage to the window and severe smoke damage to the entire shop.'

The fire service also warned members of the public to be vigilant if they have snow globes in their own homes.

'Fire investigators say these types of incidents are rare, but are possible, especially with the sun lower in the sky,' the spokesman added.

'Consideration should be given to the possibility that this could happen in your homes, particularly with shaving type mirrors which can focus the suns rays and cause fires.'

The window of the shop was boarded up to keep the premises secure. 

A spokesman from the British Heart Foundation said that the shop remained closed and it is not yet known when it would reopen.
