As Barcelona eased a step closer to the next round of the Champions League, not all their players left the Etihad pitch with a smile on their face.

Defender Dani Alves stropped off the pitch while throwing a tantrum after being substituted shortly after he was sent flying by former Arsenal defender Gael Clichy, who was subsequently handed a second yellow for his troubles.

Both ended up walking down the tunnel early but it was the Brazilian who took the decision the hardest as he booted a water bottle upon leaving the pitch and caught his foot on some metal railings.

It is not known whether Alves was replaced because he was injured or for tactical reasons but his decision to dedicate his powerful right foot to the metal frame is unlikely to help if it’s the former.

Clichy will miss the return leg in Spain through suspension but Alves will probably have calmed down enough to take to the field in the last 16 second leg tie.
