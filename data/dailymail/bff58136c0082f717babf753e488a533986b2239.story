Hot property: Pippa Middleton is at the heart of a U.S. TV bidding war to get her first chat show interview

Pippa Middleton is the prize in a £300,000 bidding war between two U.S. talk show queens for her first television interview.

Oprah Winfrey and Barbara Walters, America's arch-rival chat heavyweights, are 'pulling out all the stops' to snare her as a guest in an hour-long special.

The slender brunette became a sensation across the Atlantic after her scene-stealing turn as bridesmaid at her sister Kate's sumptuous wedding to Prince William last year.

Chat show bosses see the 28-year-old - who is about to start promoting a new book on throwing the perfect party - as the biggest prize among their dream guests for 2012.

U.S. TV executives are fighting to seal a deal with Penguin, Pippa's publishers, for her first proper television interview later on this year.

It is not the first time that Pippa has been at the heart of a bidding battle.

Penguin handed the Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister a reported £400,000 after slugging it out in a war of the wallets with some of the country's biggest publishing houses.

HarperCollins and Random House’s subsidiary, Cornerstone, were also said to be keen to buy the book - about being the perfect hostess - but Penguin pipped them to the post.

A friend told the Daily Mail last November: 'It will be about entertaining and how to throw the perfect party. It’s not just about being the perfect hostess – it will also include recipes and information about how to host different types of events.

‘Pippa has been sketching out the chapters and has decided to start each one with an amusing anecdote.’

As a professional party planner for London-based events company Table Talk, Pippa is in the perfect position to write about hosting parties.

She is also a talented writer and edits The Party Times, an online newsletter on her parents’ Party Pieces website.

The younger Middleton sister is said 
to be keen not to be seen as cashing in on her royal connections to 
promote the book, but she is fast becoming a celebrity in her own right.

Already, Pippa has been pictured on the cover of dozens of U.S. magazines, and insiders at OWN, Oprah's network, told the Sunday Mirror that the boss, 57, has told them to 'pull out all the stops to secure her first TV interview.

ABC TV chat legend Walters, meanwhile, is pushing executives at her network to offer six-figures for a chat and rival network NBC has lined up a slot on Ellen De Generes's chat show.

A U.S. TV source told the Sunday Mirror: 'The big guns see Pippa as the big-name interview of 2012. Oprah and Barbara Walters are hot on the case.'

Pippa is expected to donate any fee to charity.
