Police have launched a hunt for poachers who beheaded 100 deer and left the remains scattered across woodland in Spain.

Horrified ramblers in the Castile and Leon region of central Spain stumbled upon the macabre sight during an afternoon stroll.

Sickened walker Narela Hinojosa, 37, said: 'It was like something out of a horror film.

'We came to a clearing in the forest and just saw all these heads and bodies littered all over the place.

'I nearly vomited, it was so gross and the smell was unbearable.

'Most of the heads had antlers missing and some of the carcasses had no legs.

'It looked like a massacre had taken place.'

Now animal rights groups have vowed to have the people responsible brought to justice.

A spokesman for the Nature Protection Service, a public organisation responsible for nature and the environment, said: 'Preliminary investigations suggest the animals were trapped in snow and weakened by lack of food.

'Hunters took advantage of this and killed them before chopping them up.

'We also have reports from locals saying they had seen people driving cars full of deer heads.

'It is not the first time in these mountains that poachers have taken advantage of the snow and killed animals that are tired and hungry.

'But we have never seen it on this scale before. This type of hunting is illegal and forbidden as the animals have no chance of escape.'

A police spokesman said they were now trying to trace the poachers.

A local huntsman Melito Muro Manzanares, 49, said: 'They call themselves hunters but this isn't hunting.

'It is poaching at its most barbaric and it brings the sport a bad name. Keeping down the numbers of deer is important for the environment, but it needs to be done at the right time of year, and in the right way.'
