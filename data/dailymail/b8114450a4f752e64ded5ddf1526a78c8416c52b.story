A collection of touching photographs taken by children whose lives have been affected by cancer gives a candid glimpse at how youngsters battling the disease see the world around them.

The project is ran by childrens' charity. the Pablove Foundation, and is called 'Shutterbugs'.

The idea is to help children who have been effected by cancer to express themselves creatively by handing them a camera and teaching them how to use it.

The charity set up a summer camp, staging workshops and one to one mentoring which allowed over 300 pediatric patients in New York and Los Angeles the chance to get involved.

In motion: Bai Hao, aged 13, is one of 300 children living with cancer who have been helped by the Pablove Foundation, she chose to shoot this action frame of a young girl running

High definition: The project is aimed at getting young people whose lives have been affected by the disease to express their creativity, just as Bianca, 18, has done in this snap

Cityscape: The Pablove Shutterbugs project places a camera in the hands of the young person and encourages them to explore, Briany, 6, chose to shoot out of a window to get this frame

On track: The foundation aims to give children who have been effected by the illness a positive outlook by encouraging them to look at the world in a more creative way, as Brianna, age 14, has done with this picture of a runner

Looking up: This image by Antonella, age 7, will be one of those hung at the Manhattan exhibition being staged by the Pablove Shutterbugs - she created this child's perspective by shooting from a low angle

Strike a pose: Oleg, 13, took a picture of a friend who is obscured by a curtain. The children learned about visual effects as part of their photography workshops, which were held by the Pablove Foundation

Traffic: Ashley C, 13, from New York may not be old enough to drive, but she chose to make the notorious road congestion of her home state the subject of her picture

Creative: Shessid, age 12, shot still items through a lens that she altered herself using objects that she found

On reflection: This shot of an uninspiring New York road, by Juan, 13, is given beauty by the blue sky reflection

Heavy weather: Sarah, age 13, also used a puddle to show an alternative view of New York's buildings

Dearly beloved: Rogan, age 7, decided that his stuffed bunny would make a good model for his photography

The results are these stunning images which will now be shown in a moving exhibition in Manhattan with proceeds going towards the continuation of the camera project.

Among some of the striking images, which are taken from a child's point of view, are frames some of the Big Apple's most iconic scenes.

One pint-sized snapper turned their camera toward the Brooklyn bridge, while another chose to shoot a child's height profile of the famous yellow taxi.

Time to shine: Nicolas, age 11, used this polished surface to capture the sun's reflection for his frame

Big wheel: Michael, age 13 from New York, made use of a motorbike toy to create this optical illusion

Cool pooch: Lauren, age 8, shot this stuffed toy wearing a cool pair of shades next to a pet store sign

Catch the light: Keila, age 11, made good use of light and dark for this interesting snap

Hanging out: Kahron, age 12, shot this image of a carefree youngster is perfect for the Pablove exhibition

Faithful representation: Young Jason, 10, chose to shoot a religious figurine, while Iris, 11 focussed on her doll

Can you tell what it is?: Jasmita, Age 14, pointed the lens of her camera down a tube to create this hole effect

Guardian: Jacob, age 10, shot his favourite toy which appears to be guarding the city

Downtown train: Giancarlos, 8, took a picture of a passing train with the reflection of a sign in the middle

Local wildlife: Elena, age 7, took a picture of a flock of pigeons which had gathered on a lamp post

In other shots, New York's eccentric inhabitants are the stars with one shot showing a man dressed as a superhero crossing the street.

In another, a beloved toy bunny is given a close-up portrait while many of the children simply look up and snap the city around them.

The Pablove Foundation is named after Pablo Thrailkill Castelaz, who was six years old when he lost his yearlong battle with bilateral Wilms Tumor, a rare form of childhood cancer.

The mission of The Pablove Foundation is to fund pediatric cancer research and advances in treatment, educate and empower cancer families, and improve the quality of life for children living with cancer through hospital play, music and arts programs.

The Manhattan exhibition takes place on October 19 from 4pm to 8pm at Lu Magnus Gallery in Hester St, New York.

On the run: Chasity, age 7, took her camera along to a local fun run and captured this 'superhero'

Tree view: Brianna, age 12, was curious about the birds perched in a tree near her New York home

Asleep at the wheel: Brandon, 8, took a picture of a young rider taking a break on his tricycle

Looking up: Bennett, 10, pointed his lens upwards at a chandelier, giving the impression that it is falling down

What's in there?: Ashley, 10, was curious when he saw this big red barn with its doors slightly ajar

Splash: Hopefully Quinton, aged 8, didn't get took close to this fountain with the camera he was given by the Pablove Foundation
