Suresh Raina hit an unbeaten 110 as India defeated Zimbabwe by six-wickets to ensure they finished the group stages unbeaten.

Earlier, Brendan Taylor had hit an impressive 138 in his final match for Zimbabwe before moving to England to play for county side Nottinghamshire as a Kolpak player.

However, the 29-year-old was denied a fairytale ending by Raina and MS Dohni as the reigning champions were pushed hard to ensure they kept up their winning momentum.

Despite being an emotional day for Taylor, who had spoken about his sadness at leaving the international stage, he became the first Zimbabwean player ever to hit back-to-back World Cup centuries.

And, on a record-breaking day Taylor passed his mentor Alistair Campbell for the most one-day international hundreds scored with his eighth ton.

For India, they passed their first real test as they stretched their World Cup winning streak to 10 – behind only Australia on 25.

On a green wicket, batting first always seemed like the ideal option but having won the toss Dhoni said he wanted his side to be tested and face a chase, so chose to bowl.

It seemed unlikely that Dhoni was going to be granted his wish as his consistently impressive trio of fast bowlers, Mohammad Shami, Umesh Yadav and Mohit Sharma, each took an early wicket to reduce Zimbabwe to 33-3.

Plenty of supporters were still finding their way into Eden Park when a fuller Yadav delivery caught the outside edge of Hamilton Masakadza’s bat (2) and Dohni took a low catch behind the stumps.

Six balls later Chamu Chibhabha (7) followed his fellow opener back into the hut as he sent a thick edge into the hand of Shihkar Dhawan in the slips off the bowling of Shami.

And when Solomon Mire was caught behind off Mohit for a turgid nine from 22-balls, Zimbabwe looked to be buckling against the world champions.

However, it arguably brought Zimbabwe’s two best batsmen, Taylor and Sean Williams, to the crease and together they rebuilt their side’s innings.

The pair shared a 93-run fourth wicket partnership as both batsman battled against each other to reach their half-centuries first, with the chase won by captain Taylor.

Williams (50) followed suit the very next ball but then fell tamely has he attempted to whack the ball hard past bowler Ravichandran Ashwin only to be caught sharply by the spinner.

Taylor though wasn’t willing to leave the international stage without a personal milestone and he found a willing partner in Craig Ervine to help him to his ton.

As the wicketkeeper-batsman passed 73 he became the highest Zimbabwean run-maker in a World Cup, surpassing Neil Johnson’s 367 in 1999, finally finishing with 405 runs for the campaign.

And, after reaching the all-important three figures Taylor exploded, smashing one Ravindra Jadeja over for 24 runs.

However, he departed in the next over as he lofted the ball to Dhawan at mid-off off Mohit for an impressive 138 off 110 balls.

Congratulated by many of the Indian players, Taylor walked off to a standing ovation by the 30,000 strong crowd.

Zimbabwe’s progress could easily have been stunted by their loss of regular wickets but their deep batting line-up continued to impress as they regularly cleared the ropes.

India’s spinners, Ashwin and Jadeja, who were seen pre-World Cup as their main bowling threat, disappeared for a collective 1-146 from their 20 overs.

A quick-fire 28 from Sikandar Raza helped propel Zimbabwe to 287 all out but India’s supposedly weak bowling line-up bowled out their sixth side in six matches.

Buoyed by Taylor’s exceptional innings Zimbabwe strode confidently out on to the field after the innings break.

Despite Tinashe Panyangara’s first over going for nine runs India struggled to get the ball away early on.

The pressure of tight bowling and a build-up of dot balls saw the dangerous Rohit Sharma (16) attempt to drive a length ball from the right-arm bowler only to be caught by a back-pedaling Raza at cover.

Dhawan departed just four balls later as Panyangara’s shattered his stumps to silence the shocked crowd, to give the bowler a double-wicket maiden.

Zimbabwe have conceded on average just 3.25 runs in the first powerplay, the lowest of all 14 teams, and India struggled to 35-2 at the end of 10 overs.

With their side struggling Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane shared a 50-run partnership before the latter was run-out as he attempted to test fielder at cover and failed.

Zimbabwe were all over India and reduced them 92-4 as Kohli attempted to sweep Raza round the corner and was bowled for 38.

With the run-rate creeping up Raina and Dohni continued to find it hard to get the ball away but the turning point in match came when Raina was dropped by Hamilton Masakadza on 47.

It was a hugely costly error as the-28-year-old went on to score his hundred off just 94 balls, having hit seven fours and four sixes.

And, for the ninth one-day international match of his career Dhoni (77 not out) ended the match by sending the ball clear past the ropes for six with eight balls remaining.

Admittedly it was a disappointing end for Zimbabwe, who’s future once again looks unclear with the lost of one of their greatest players, whilst India’s march towards a second consecutive World Cup title continues at pace.
