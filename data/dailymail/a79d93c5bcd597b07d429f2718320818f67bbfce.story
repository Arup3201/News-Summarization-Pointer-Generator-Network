A second night of protests in Berkeley and Oakland, California turned unruly as demonstrators vandalized businesses, walked onto a freeway and threw explosives at police officers. 

Berkeley police Officer Jennifer Coats says Sunday evening's protest began peacefully until two demonstrators smashed the window of a RadioShack.

She said a doctor who tried to stop the vandalism was injured when he tried to stop the looting and was struck with a hammer.

At least one business owner reported that his building had been vandalized with spray paint, Coats added.
