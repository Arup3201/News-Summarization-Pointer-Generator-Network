Have you ever wondered if Louis van Gaal is actually bothered?

I’m not for one second suggesting he doesn’t care about his work, or that he isn’t trying. He is a professional, anyone with even the slightest knowledge of his career will know that.

But throw forward to summer 2015. Imagine that Manchester United finished outside the top four and didn’t achieve the target of making it into the Champions League next season. He might be sacked, but there is a chance Van Gaal might still be  at United. Either way, he will be the subject of fierce, and understandable, criticism for his failure to lift United into the top four.

My own view is that if he makes it in to the top four, fine. If he doesn’t then he has failed in his first season at United, even if they lift the FA Cup.

But I can’t believe Van Gaal will lose sleep, because his reputation is totally intact whatever happens under him at Old Trafford. His place among the greats is already assured.

He has won titles in three different countries with four different clubs.

His Champions League-winning Ajax team in 1995 was stunning. They knew their jobs, they were organised to the point of boring efficiency, but with the sparkling creativity of Marc Overmars on one wing, Finidi George on the other and the sublime Jari Litmanen at his peak in the fantasy role. 

That team was the perfect mix of function and flair; it’s a team that will go down in football history as one of the very best. Critics might say they underachieved, but that wasn’t a failing of Van Gaal. It was thanks mainly to the emergence and effects of the Bosman ruling, which saw Ajax unable to keep those players together.

One of his spells with the Dutch national side was a disaster, the other saw them finish third in the world. In Brazil, he even managed to win a penalty shootout (the Dutch are as fearful of these things as the English) with an innovative substitution (throwing on Tim Krul at the death) boosting his reputation hugely. He then lost one in the semi-final.

So he’s not the greatest, but Van Gaal is certainly one of the greats. If you’re still not convinced, then I refer to you the work of the man named coach of the century by FIFA in 1999. In his brilliant book Teambuilding: The Road To Success, Rinus Michels names several 'top-notch coaches' to whom the 'evolution of the game of football can be attributed to. These coaches developed team tactical innovations which improved the performance level of their teams.' Michels added: 'Due to the success of these coaches other coaches plunged into these new styles of play.'

Michels then lists these coaches: the Brazilian legend Mario Zagallo; Argentine pragmatist Helenio Herrera – the catenaccio king, successful at three European giants but notably at Inter Milan; Sir Alf Ramsey and his wingless wonders developing the 4-4-2 system with England’s World Cup winners in 1966; Michels himself (he wasn’t modest, understandably so given his record) for bringing Total Football to the table; Franz Beckenbauer’s World Cup-winning 3-5-2 with marauding full backs; Johan Cruyff who created history at Barcelona with his 3-4-3 designed to control midfield and therefore control the game; and then last on the chronological list, Van Gaal, who further developed Cruyff’s ideas.

The book was published in 2001, Michels died in 2005, so we can only guess who might be added to the list: possibly Jose Mourinho, surely Pep Guardiola.

Even so, for Van Gaal to be included on the original list is surely evidence of how much he is respected within global coaching circles. He’s been at that level for a long time.

Of course some players hated him, Rivaldo was particularly scathing when he left Barcelona. But then you only have to look at the number of quality players who have followed him to a new club to realise as many, probably more, loved working under him.

Journalists have fallen out with him in the past – the brilliant Dutch football journalist Hugo Borst was close to Van Gaal but they fell out. Borst’s book on the United boss, O, Louis, is one of the best I’ve read in the past few months.

I don’t know Van Gaal personally but professionally I’ve always found him charming and engaging. However, I am under no illusions, this situation could change at any moment.

So with United still trying to recover from losing a brilliant manager and an efficient chief executive in the summer of 2013, Van Gaal knows he may succeed or he may fail. He obviously wants to get it right, but if he doesn’t, he may choose to retire in his mid-60s, safe in the knowledge that his reputation as one of the great coaches in the history of football is intact.

Meanwhile, some bang average ex-footballers on English television will still be trying to tell us all that Van Gaal doesn’t know what he’s doing.

One wonders if these former 'Premier League greats' have even heard of Rinus Michels.
