A company of elite archers who drowned aboard the warship Mary Rose have been identified by researchers who found repetitive strain injuries on their shoulders and backs.

The archers were among 92 skeletons of those who died aboard Henry VIII's flagship, which sank in 1545 and was raised from the Solent in 1982.

'It was a requirement by law for every male to practice archery regularly from an early age, and many of the skeletons recovered show evidence of repetitive stress injuries of the shoulder and lower spine,' explained Alexzandra Hildred, curator of ordnance at the Mary Rose Trust.

The remains of the Mary Rose lying in its specialist dry-dock at Portsmouth dockyard: Researchers have identified archers from a company of longbowmen who went down with the ship from their RSI

'This could be as a result of the shooting heavy longbows regularly. Being able to quantify the stresses and their effect on the skeleton may enable us at last to isolate an elite group of professional archers from the ship.'

For the past 18 months the Mary Rose Trust has been working with sports scientists from the College of Engineering at Swansea University to discover more about the lives of the medieval archers on board the ship.

Contamination by cockles, molluscs and algae had made DNA identification difficult, but new techniques have now made it possible to identify the skeletons' origins and even personal features like eye and hair colour, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Nick Owen, Sport and Exercise 
Biomechanist from the College of Engineering at Swansea University, led 
research into how the effect of a lifetime of archery affected bowmen, 
who were the special forces of their day.

By
making a biomechanical analysis of the skeletons of the medieval 
archers he and his team examined the effect of constantly using and 
practicing with the very powerful longbows on the musculoskeletal 
system.

'This sample of human remains offers a unique opportunity to study activity related changes in human skeletons,' he said.

'It is documented that there was a company of archers aboard when the ship sank, at a time when many archers came from Wales and the South West of England.

'These archers had specialist techniques for making and using very powerful longbows. Some bows required a lifetime of training and immense strength as the archers had to pull weights up to 200lbs (about 90kg).'

A longbow is a kind of bow that is roughly equal in height to the person using it.

Although they have been used by may different cultures for thousands of years, in the Middle Ages the English and Welsh were famous for their very powerful Welsh longbows made from yew.

These were used to great effect in the civil wars of the period and against the French in the Hundred Years' War, notably at the battles of Crécy in 1346, Poitiers in 1356, and, perhaps most famously, at Agincourt in 1415.

The first book in English about longbow archery was Toxophilus by Roger Ascham, first published in London in 1545 and dedicated to King Henry VIII.

The average length of arrowshafts recovered from the the Mary Rose is 30in (75cm).

One skull discovered on board the ship even had an arrow injury on its crown, that researchers believed the owner would have survived.

Mr Owen told the Telegraph how the breakthrough in DNA extraction had given his team the opportunity to profile the archers more precisely than before.

A Swedish expert is working on reconstructing the faces of the archers for the new Mary Rose Trust museum, which will open next year.

'They were 6ft 2in or 6ft 3in, and strapping individuals,' he said. 'A longbow was 6ft 6in and made from a particular part of a yew tree to generate incredibly efficient "spring".

'It was mega hi-tech, and it gave England and Wales military superiority. These archers were the elite athletes of their day.'

Once completed, the new study will help the Mary Rose Trust tell the story of the crew in much greater detail than before, when they open a brand new museum at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard next spring.

Part of the process of analysing the skeletons involves creating 3D virtual images so that measurements can be taken from the remains without causing any damage to the valuable heritage artefacts.
