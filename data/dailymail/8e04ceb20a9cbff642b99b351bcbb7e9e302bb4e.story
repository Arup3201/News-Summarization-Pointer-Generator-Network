Patrick Kennedy and his wife Amy left hospital on Thursday with their newborn baby girl, the latest addition to America's most famous clan.

Nora Kara Kennedy was introduced to the world as the Kennedys were once again in the spotlight, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination.

The baby girl is the second child for the former Rhode Island congressman and his school teacher wife. The couple, who have been married since 2011, also have an 18-month-old son called Owen. Amy Kennedy also has a 5-year-old daughter, Harper, from a previous marriage.

Patrick, who is son of late Senator Ted Kennedy and nephew of JFK, made reference to his uncle's assassination outside of the New Jersey hospital, saying that although it was a bittersweet week for the clan, Nora's arrival 'made it a whole lot sweeter'.

Mr Kennedy, 47, told NBC10: 'I
think this is so symbolic of the circle of life and how life keeps 
moving foward.

'We can look back in time and think about what would have 
been had my uncles lived but we have to live for today and we have to 
live for the future and they would want us to do that and that's why 
this marks such a special occasion.'

Baby Nora was born on Tuesday at 3.11pm weighing 6lbs and 11 ounces and measured 18 1/4 inches long, AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center spokeswoman Jennifer Tornetta said.

Patrick and Amy Kennedy, a school teacher, were married in July 2011 and live in Absecon, just southeast of Pomona.Â 

Patrick Kennedy represented Rhode Island in the U.S. House of Representatives for 16 years.

He decided not to seek re-election amid his public struggles with substance abuse, depression and bipolar disorder, Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

The scion of the Kennedy clan left 
Congress in 2011 and since then has worked on several initiatives to 
improve mental health care.

One of his projects is One Mind for Research, an effort to improve funding for brain science and better coordinate research.

In
October, he launched The Kennedy Forum to bring mental health workers 
and advocates together to improve treatments for mental illnesses, 
addictions and intellectual disabilities.
