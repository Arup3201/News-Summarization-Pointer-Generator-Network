Fad diets are so last year as more and more Brits turn their backs on quick-fix solutions. 

The Atkins, the Paleo and the Cabbage Soup diets look set to be kicked to the curb in 2015.

But while 91 per cent of Britons vow to eat healthier this year, half will quit in just three months, a YouGov survey revealed. 

Healthy eating plans: 91% of Britons vow to eat healthier this year but half will give up in just three months 

While we all want to maintain our figures and lead a healthy lifestyle, boredom and not being able to eat favourite meals are reasons why we give up on diets 

Paleolithic diets mimic the types and quantities of foods our hunter-gatherer ancestors ate. 

Pastured and wild meat, seafood, nuts, seeds, eggs, plenty of fresh vegetables and small seasonal amounts of fruit feature heavily. 

The basic premise of the Paleo diet is that this way of eating suits our genetics, which have hardly changed in the last 10,000 years. 

It is said to be much better than the grains, dairy, and processed foods that have arisen since the agricultural revolution. 

The main reason for giving up on the diets is boredom and not being able to go without their favourite meals, 71 per cent of survey respondents said. 

Despite 50 per cent of the population quitting their New Year diets after just 90 days, 91 per cent said they will try their hardest to make healthier food choices part of a routine which can be maintained for more than just the month of January.

Although eating less is no longer the trend, one place consumers are cutting back is on their meat intake.

More than one third of the consumers who took part in the poll have deliberately cut the amount of meat they eat and 48 per cent of these cite improving their health as the main reason.

Dietician Alison Clarke said: 'Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the health benefits of eating a diet rich in protein and low in saturated fat, which meat alternatives can provide.

'People are wise to alternative protein sources and the long term benefits that these offer when it comes to overall health and weight control as part of a balanced diet.'

Women do not seem as bothered about their meat intake as just 27 per cent have said they will cut down, although 60 per cent of men are trying to eat less.

Eating meat alternatives is seen as a healthier option, with 50 per cent of consumers questioned focused on reducing either their calorie intake or saturated fat from their diet to become healthier this year.

The poll was commissioned by meat-alternative brand, Quorn.   

Fad diets like Paleo (left) and the cabbage soup will soon be a thing of the past, the survey indicated 

Ms Clarke added: 'It's clear that fad diets just aren't sustainable and people who attempt them may see short term benefits, but suffer long term disappointment at the results as well as potential health issues.

'A sustainable diet should allow you to eat your favourite meals, but in as healthy a way as possible. That way you're less likely to fail at the first hurdle.

'Eating healthily in 2015 should not be difficult or boring.'
