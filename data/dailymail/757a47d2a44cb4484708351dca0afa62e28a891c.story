He was the man who saved the world by single-handedly averting World War Three five decades ago, yet he died humiliated, outcast and an unknown. Only now has his story has come to light.

A documentary shown tonight told how for 13 days during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, the world held its breath as the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. stood on the brink of nuclear war.

At the height of the Cold War, when paranoia on both sides meant the slightest provocation could spark nuclear war, four submarines secretly set sail from Russia to communist Cuba.

Averted war: Vasili Arkhipoy (pictured left, and right aboard a submarine), saved the world by single-handedly averting World War Three with one decision 50 years ago, yet he died humiliated, outcast and an unknown

Only a handful of the submariners on 
board knew that their ships carried nuclear weapons, each with the 
strength of the bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945.

Vasili Arkhipov, aboard the sub B59, 
was one of them. As his craft neared Cuba, U.S. helicopters, aeroplanes 
and battleships were scouring the ocean for Russian subs.

'At that period of time it was called 
"special weapon", not "nuclear torpedo",’ said Viktor Mikhailov, junior 
navigator on Sub B-59. ‘At that time we couldn't even imagine a nuclear 
torpedo.’

In a game of high stakes cat and mouse
 it wasn't long before the Russians were spotted. Arkhipov's sub was 
forced to make an emergency dive.

Remembered: Arkhipov is pictured left with his wife Olga in 1957, and right with his daughter Yelena, three years before he died in 1998

Tense:  For 13 days during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, the world held its breath as the USSR and the U.S. stood on the brink of nuclear war

As the submariners tried to stay 
hidden from their US hunters, conditions in the sub deteriorated. For a 
week they stayed underwater, in sweltering 60C heat, rationed to just 
one glass of water a day.

'Basically what we were trying to do was apply passive torture. Frankly I don't think we felt any sympathy for them at all. They were the enemy'

Gary Slaughter, USS Cony signalman

Above them, the U.S. navy were 
'hunting by exhaustion' - trying to force the Soviet sub to come to the 
surface to recharge its batteries.

They had no idea that on board the submarines were weapons capable of destroying the entire American fleet.

Gary Slaughter, a signalman on board 
the USS Cony battleship, said: 'We knew they were probably having 
trouble breathing. It was hot as hell in there, they were miserable.

Mr President: John F. Kennedy was in office in the U.S. between 1961 and 1963, at the height of the crisis

Tense: The documentary recreated the dramatic moment when Soviet sailors decided not to fire the weapon

'They were cramped together and they 
had been under great stress for a long time. Basically what we were 
trying to do was apply passive torture.

'They said that the person who prevented a nuclear war was the Russian submariner Vasili Arkhipov. I was proud and I am proud of my husband always'

Olga Arkipov, widow of Vasili Arkhipov

'Frankly I don't think we felt 
any sympathy for them at all. They were the enemy.'

The Americans decided to ratchet up 
the pressure, and dropped warning grenades into the sea. Inside the sub,
 the Soviet submariners thought they were under attack.

Valentin Savitsky, the captain of B59,
 was convinced the nuclear war had already started.

He demanded that the
 submariners launch their torpedo to save some of Russia's pride.

The programme on Channel 5 revealed how in
 any normal circumstances Savitsky's orders would have been followed, 
and World War Three would have been unleashed.

'Close friend': Ryurik Ketov, commander of Sub B-4, said Arkhipov was 'cool-headed' and 'in control'

Memories: Viktor Mikhailov, junior navigator on Sub B-59, said they had a 'special weapon' on board, which was not even referred to as a 'nuclear weapon'

Ryurik Ketov, commander of another sub, Sub B-4, 
said: ‘Vasili Arkhipov was a submariner and a close friend of mine. He 
was a family friend. He stood out for being cool-headed. He was in 
control.’

'One of the Russian admirals told the submariners: "It would have been better if you'd gone down with your ship". Extraordinary'

Thomas Blanton, historian

Savitsky hadn't counted on 
Arkhipov. As commander of the fleet, Arkhipov had the last veto. And 
although his men were against him, he insisted that they must not fire -
 and instead surrender.

It was a humiliating move - but one 
that saved the world. The Soviet submariners were forced to return to 
their native Russia, where they were given the opposite of a hero's 
welcome.

Historian Thomas Blanton told the Sun:
 'What heroism, what duty, they fulfilled to go halfway across the world
 and come back, and survive.

Covert mission: In a game of high stakes cat and mouse it wasn't long before the Russian's were spotted

Proud: Arkopov's widow Olga said: 'I was proud and I am proud of my husband, always'

'But in fact, one of the Russian 
admirals told the submariners; "It would have been better if you'd gone 
down with your ship." Extraordinary.'

'Vasili Arkhipov was a submariner and a close friend of mine. He was a family friend. He stood out for being cool-headed. He was in control'

Ryurik Ketov, commander of Sub B-4

Four decades passed before the story of what
 really happened on the B59 sub was discovered. It was after Arkipov 
had died in 1998 from radiation poisoning.

But to his widow Olga, he was
 always a hero.

She said: 'He knew that it was 
madness to fire the nuclear torpedo. In Cuba, in honour of the 40th 
anniversary of the crisis, people gathered.

‘They said that the person who 
prevented a nuclear war was the Russian submariner Vasili Arkhipov. I 
was proud and I am proud of my husband always.’
