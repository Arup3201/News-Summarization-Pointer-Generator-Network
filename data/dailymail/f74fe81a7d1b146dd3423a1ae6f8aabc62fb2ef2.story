A Florida man who was caught on tape having sex with his family's chihuahua has been jailed.

Marc Ramon Gonzalez, 61, from Palm Beach County, was found out by his wife after she looked at security camera footage of her husband abusing the pet near the patio door. 

He pleaded guilty to animal cruelty and sexual activity with an animal and received 100 days in jail along with 12 months' probation, the county clerk's office told Daily Mail Online.

Gonzalez shared his Wellington home with his wife and three young children and would often go out into their backyard .

A police report about the incident, in November 2013, included testimony from a dog expert who said that the dog was constantly in an uncomfortably submissive posture, with his head and ears down while Gonzalez abused him and touched himself.

Gonzalez's wife then rushed outside and confronted her husband.

The animal, which bore marks of physical trauma afterwards, tried to escape multiple times unsuccessfully and 'did not like what was happening'.

Though Florida did not have a law against bestiality for many years, sexual activity with an animal and animal cruelty are both first degree misdemeanors (dog similar to the one abused)

The man originally pleaded not guilty before striking a deal with prosecutors.

Sexual activity with an animal is a first degree misdemeanor in Florida, punishable by up to a year in prison or a $1,000 fine.

Animal cruelty is also a first degree misdemeanor and punishable by a year in prison or up to a $5,000 fine.

Cruelty that 'results in the cruel death, or excessive or repeated infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering' is a third degree felony and punishable by up to five years in prison. 

'We wish there was stronger laws. We wish people would immediately go to jail and stay there,' Capt. Dave Walesky, Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control, told WPEC. 

'It just doesn't make sense why people do things like that. There's no reason to justify something like that,' he said.  

Florida is the number one state for animal abuse crimes, according to Pet-Abuse.com.

The state officially passed a law banning bestiality in 2011, after many years without one.

As of early last year 12 states and the District of Columbia did not have specific laws against bestiality, according to AL.com.

However, many cases of bestiality are prosecuted under animal cruelty charges.
