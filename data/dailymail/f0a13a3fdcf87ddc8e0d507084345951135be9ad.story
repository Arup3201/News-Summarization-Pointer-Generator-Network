The nurse who gunned down a new mother and snatched her three-day-old baby outside a doctor's clinic so she could raise him as her own has appeared before a judge.

Verna McClain, 38, appeared before a Montgomery County judge wearing a pink and white striped jumpsuit and, when asked if she 
understood the capital murder charge against her, replied: 'Yes, 
sir.'

McClain, who recently suffered a miscarriage, is accused of fatally shooting Kala Golden Schuchardt, 28, on Tuesday afternoon in Spring, Texas before fleeing with her son Keegan Schuchardt.

'Killer': Verna McClain, 38, appeared in a Montgomery County court on Thursday to say she understood the capital murder charges against her after she allegedly shot a new mother and stole her baby

It has now emerged that McClain, a 
registered nurse and mother of two, had suffered a miscarriage but did 
not tell her fiance, who she planned to marry in May, the Houston 
Chronicle reported.

Instead, she told the man that she had given birth to their baby. Investigators claim she was looking for a baby to present as theirs, and had picked Kala at random after seeing her outside the clinic.

Her sister also told authorities that McClain had told her she was planning to adopt. She added that once McClain had snatched Keegan, she said she had the baby and needed 'to do the adoption'.

Ms Golden was walking to her pick-up truck after a check-up with Keegan around 2 p.m., when a woman in a 2007 Lexus parked in the adjacent spot starting fighting with her, police said.

After shooting the 28-year-old mother at close range, McClain allegedly placed the baby in her car and sped off, hitting Kala as she shrieked 'my baby!' from the ground. She died shortly after.

Deputies stormed an apartment block less than a mile away after the getaway car was seen parked outside. McClain approached officers and admitted to the killing and kidnapping, police said.

McClain told detectives she had taken the boy to a home in northwest Harris County. He was found there unharmed six hours after his mother had died.

There had previously been reports of a man helping McClain snatch the baby but these claims appear to be unfounded, detectives said. The incident remains under investigation.

Baby Keegan is 
now with family members, who have been left distraught by the brutal killing.

Montgomery County Sheriff's Detective 
John Schmitt said McClain does 'appear remorseful for what happened', 
the Chronicle reported.

In court, Judge Fred Edwards appointed E. Tay Bond as McClain's attorney and agreed to delay the case until Monday so he would have time to review the case.

Bond said he expects McClain will plead not guilty in the case, the Chronicle reported.

Caught: Investigators were led to the baby after the getaway car was seen outside an apartment where McClain's sister Corina, left, lived. McClain, right, had told her sister she was adopting the baby

Happy: Keith, pictured with Kala on their wedding day, said he was did not know how to deal with her death

After the incident, McClain's 
estranged husband said he was shocked by the events. 
Together the couple has two children and she helped raise a third from 
his previous relationship.

'She's not a violent person, so for her 
to shoot someone, it was shocking,' said Theo McClain, 34, from San 
Diego, California. 'This is all crazy to me.'

He added that his estranged wife had 
not mentioned she was going to adopt a child, and said there had never 
been any signs of mental illness in the woman.

County
District 
Attorney Brett Ligon said authorities 'believe this was an intentional 
act on her part, not that Ms Golden was targeted specifically, but that 
this was part of a plan to kidnap a child'.

The baby's father Keith Schuchardt added to KHOU on Tuesday: 'She was sweet, lovable. I loved her, and she loved me. Everything was going fine until today.'

When asked by reporters what he would tell his wife now, Schuchardt, who had been married to Golden for three years, said: I wish you were here with me to get me through this.'

Verna McClain's mother was distraught when she heard of the killing. 'I'm sorry for the family,' she said on KHOU.
