Lurking off the coast of Scotland are swarms of stunning jellyfish - from the common moon to the rare purple striped stinger and the tiny Neoturris pileata. 

And divers Matt Doggett and Richard Shucksmith have captured these floating beauties in exquisite detail. 

The images include a number of bright and colourful jellyfish that are rarely spotted so close to the UK, as well as so-called sea squirts which have been seen in abundance in recent years.   

The colourful mauve stingers (pictured) have tentacles that can grow around 13ft-long (four metre) and these eight tentacles are dangerous for unprotected divers.The species is also known as Pelagia noctiluca which means 'open ocean night light' in Latin

The images are from a collection called Earth In Focus and were captured off the coast of Scotland around the outlying islands of North Rona and Sula Sgeir, some 85 miles (136km) west of Stromness, as well as in Loch Duich.

The divers said the further they headed offshore, the more bizarre and rare these lifeforms became and Mr Doggett, 36 from Southampton, said a particular highlight was the mauve stinger. 

Also known as the purple striped stinger, this species is native to warmer waters around the Mediterranean, Bermuda and deeper waters of the Atlantic Ocean.

They can vary in colour depending on their size - larger jellies are typically bright red to dark purple while smaller ones are lighter yellows and oranges, like a lion's mane, which gives the species its name. They are typically found in the waters of the Arctic, Northern Atlantic and Northern Pacific

It is native to warmer waters around Bermuda and is a rare visitor to the UK

The images are from a collection called Earth In Focus. The divers captured various species of jellyfish including so-called mild stingers that grow around 4 inches (10cm) in diameter. These stingers have multiple radial canals that connect the centre to the edge of the flat bell

Also known as the purple striped stinger, this species is native to warmer waters around the Mediterranean, Bermuda and deeper waters of the Atlantic Ocean. 

It is a rare visitor to the UK but has been known to travel to the western coast of the British Isles and many experts believe the movement is linked to global warming.

The jellies have tentacles that can grow around 13ft-long (four metre) and are dangerous for unprotected divers.

Mr Doggett said: 'Despite all the dive gear, you still have to be careful not to get a stinging tentacle in the face so you do approach them with care.

'Some tentacles can be several metres long and could sting you before you see the jellyfish. 

'So we always took care to look around carefully and point them out to each other.

'It was interesting to see young fish taking shelter in the tentacles of the lion's mane and mauve stinger jellies which they use to stay safe from predators.'

Another shot captures the lion's mane jellyfish in green, shallower water.

They can vary in colour depending on their size - larger jellies are typically bright red to dark purple while smaller ones are lighter yellows and oranges, like a lion's mane, which gives the species its name. 

Like other jellies, the lion's mane jellyfish reproduces asexually until it reaches full maturity at which point it reproduces sexually.

The largest of these jellies have been recorded up to 120ft long (36.5 metres) and with more than 800 tentacles divided into eight groups. 

While the smallest of the species measure just half an inch (1.3 cm) in diameter and are 8 ft long (2.4 metres).

While diving in Loch Duich Mr Doggett spotted a swarm of harmless moon jellyfish (shown). Moon jellyfish are also known as Aurelia aurita and grow up to 40cm (15.7 inches) in diameter. They are recognisable by their patterns of spots and streaks and swim horizontally, keeping the bell near the surface at all times. This allows the tentacles to be spread over the largest possible area, in order to better catch food

The left-hand image shows a close-up of a species known as Neoturris pileata. They grow around 1.5 inches long (4cm) and can have up to 90 tentacles. There are more than 350 different types of jellyfish and some 2,000 variations within these species. Despite their reputation, many are harmless. The right-hand image was captured around 85 miles (136km) west of Stromness

This image shows Mr Doggett capturing the previous close-up image of Neoturris pileata. The tiny swimmers typically first appear in the Northern North Sea, off the Norwegian coast and around Kattegat and Skagerrak in May. They can still be spotted as late as September

They are typically found in the waters of the Arctic, Northern Atlantic and Northern Pacific. 

While diving in Loch Duich, Mr Doggett spotted a swarm of harmless moon jellyfish. 

Moon jellyfish are also known as Aurelia aurita or saucer jellies and grow up to 40cm (15.7 inches) in diameter. 

They are recognisable by their patterns of spots and streaks and swim horizontally, keeping the bell near the surface at all times. This allows the tentacles to spread over the largest possible area and increase the chances of catching prey.

This image shows a mauve stinger in the foreground as a seal swims in the background. Mr Doggett said that distance of the outlying islands from the mainland 'and their exposure to Atlantic storms and swell makes their wildlife both spectacular but also hard to reach. If the weather gods are on your side and the opportunity exists, these sites will have any diver in awe of the beauty within our seas'

Mr Doggett said: 'The million moon jellies in Loch Duich were incredible and we returned the following day to photograph them and swim amongst them. As they do not sting it was a very relaxing, calming and enjoyable dive.

'Jellyfish are beautiful creatures both in colour and form and it was wonderful to have the opportunity to take time to show them looking at their finest.'

The photographers also captured images of sea squirts, a type of filter feeder that lives on the ocean floor. 

There are more than 3,000 known species worldwide but many are found in warmer, tropical waters. They are protected by a thin membrane and are typically cylindrical. 

In addition to the common bell-shaped jellies, smaller species include what's known as comb jellies  or ctenophores (pictured). They get their name from tiny hairs called cilia that line their bodies and resemble combs. There are eight rows of combs that act like oars to help them swim
