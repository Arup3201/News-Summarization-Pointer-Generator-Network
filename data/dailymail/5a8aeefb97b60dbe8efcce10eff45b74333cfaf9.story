More than 90 people are in quarantine in Mali after a cleric from Guinea who was carrying the Ebola virus infected a nurse and a doctor before dying.

A nurse has already died after treating the imam at a private clinic in Bamako after he sought treatment for what doctors initially thought was kidney failure.

Yesterday a doctor at the same clinic was also revealed to be infected. A woman who was being treated at Bamako's Gabriel Toure Hospital - the city's second largest - tested positive as well.

The world's worst epidemic of the haemorrhagic fever on record has killed at least 5,160 people since it erupted in March in West Africa, a region dogged by poverty and poor healthcare.

It has ravaged Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea and spurred a global watch for its spread. 

Now Mali, which shares an 500-mile border with Guinea, is rushing to impose tougher measures to contain the spread of Ebola.

'The president of the republic has asked the prime minister to look urgently at the entire system put in place to fight Ebola and to strengthen health controls at the different frontier posts,' a government statement said.

More than 90 people have been quarantined in Bamako since the nurse's death, and health workers are now seeking to trace an unknown number of contact cases.

'We tested two cases today. One was negative but the other preliminary test was positive. We're waiting for the definitive results,' health ministry spokesman Daou Markatié said.

'She had participated in the washing of the imam's body.'

The death of the nurse in Mali forced a lockdown in the clinic where she had worked. 

The Pasteur Clinic, one of Bamako's leading medical facilities and the default health centre for expatriates, was being guarded by U.N. peacekeepers with armoured personnel carriers and by Malian security forces, witnesses said.

Mali's first case of Ebola was a 2-year-old girl who had been infected in Guinea and died last month.

Just as the people who had been in contact with her finished their 21 days of quarantine, Mali must now trace those who had contact with the nurse and those infected with her.

Medecins Sans Frontiers 'wasted time' by waiting too long to call for vaccines to fight an unprecedented outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, a veteran of the medical charity told Reuters.

The group's response to the epidemic which has so far killed more than 5,000 people has been widely praised by governments and the World Health Organization. While Western donors dithered and other aid groups pulled out, MSF deployed hundreds to the Ebola 'hot zones' and treated more than 3,000 patients.

But the emergency group relied too much on strategies it developed during smaller previous eruptions of the virus, leading it to make mistakes as this year's rampant multi-country epidemic pushed it to its limits, said Jean-Herve Bradol, a member of MSF's internal think-tank.

'Our response was too orientated toward the management of previous outbreaks,' Bradol, of the Paris-based Centre For Reflection on Humanitarian Action (CRASH), told Reuters, adding that MSF's public appeal for vaccine development in September came months too late.

'We wasted time before speaking about a vaccine and treatments...It's very hard to imagine controlling this epidemic now without a vaccine.'

President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita urged the World Health Organisation (WHO) and health services in Mali and neighbouring states to set up a permanent information exchange to improve awareness about public health and hygiene. 

Fueling hope of progress in containing the disease, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said she would not seek to extend a state of emergency imposed in August.

On Wednesday, the WHO said the Ebola death toll in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone had reached 5,147 out of 14,068 cases as of November 9, with 13 more deaths and 30 cases recorded in Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, Spain and the United States.

It said there was some evidence that case incidence was no longer increasing nationally in Guinea and Liberia, but steep increases persist in Sierra Leone.

Some 421 new infections were reported in Sierra Leone in the week to November 9, especially in the west and north, and the virus is still spreading intensely in Freetown, the capital, as well as in Guinea's southwest near the Liberian border, the WHO said.

The Liberian emergency, which allowed authorities to curb movement in the areas worst affected, officially expired earlier this month. Sirleaf said a night curfew would remain in effect.

Last September, the International Monetary Fund provided $130million to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in September to help them cope with the economic impact of Ebola. On Thursday, it said it would discuss debt relief for the three countries with Group of 20 leaders meeting in Australia this week.

In Washington, the Obama administration tried to assure a sceptical Senate that its efforts to combat Ebola were bearing fruit and urged lawmakers to approve $6.2 billion in new emergency funds for that purpose.

Tens of thousands of nurses across the U.S. staged protest rallies and strikes on Wednesday over what they say is insufficient protection for health workers dealing with patients possibly stricken with Ebola.

The global medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres said on Thursday that clinical trials of three potential Ebola treatments would begin in December at MSF medical centres in Guinea and Liberia.
