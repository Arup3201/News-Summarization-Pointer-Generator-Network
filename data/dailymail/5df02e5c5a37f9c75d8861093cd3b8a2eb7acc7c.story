Prince Harry today missed being awarded an operational medal for his service in Afghanistan by his father as he flew to the US to begin a week-long royal tour.

As the 28-year-old prince was en route to Washington DC, Prince Charles was visiting his son’s airbase at Wattisham in Suffolk to honour Harry’s unit, 662 Squadron.

The prince, who undertook a four-month frontline stint as an Army Air Corps Apache attack helicopter pilot in September last year, will collect his when he returns from his tour.

Charles, who was handing out medals in his role as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps, joked: 'It's a particular pleasure to see so many of 662 Squadron, which my youngest son serves in, on parade even though he is not here - he shoved off, probably because he knew his ancient parents were coming'

Charles, who was handing out medals in his role as Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps, joked self-deprecatingly: ‘It’s a particular pleasure to see so many of 662 Squadron, which my youngest son serves in, on parade even though he is not here – he shoved off, probably because he knew his ancient parents were coming.’

The prince added: ‘Having heard from him about your remarkable exploits in Afghanistan, I have some better understanding of just what you’re all up to, the challenges you face and constant demands you are under.

‘If it is any consolation, I understand very well just how many demands are faced by service families when you find yourselves required to go here, there and everywhere at short notice.

‘I think we owe the families here an enormous debt of gratitude.’

His son’s tour of the US, which begins 
in Washington this afternoon before moving onto Colorado Springs, New 
Jersey and New York before culminating in a charity polo match in 
Greenwich, Connecticut, is attracting enormous interest stateside – not 
least because his last trip, back in August, attracted a great many 
headlines of a different kind.

On a pre-deployment ‘lads’ holiday’ to Las Vegas, the third in line to the throne was photographed playing a game of ’strip billiards’ with a group of women in his £5,000-a-night hotel suite.

Harry has always refused to publicly apologise for his antics, which caused huge embarrassment to the Royal Family, but admits he ‘let his family down’.

Today he will be hoping to put the incident behind him as he focuses on some of the other great passions in his life – his charitable initiatives.

His trip begins on the world-famous Capitol Hill this afternoon where he will view an exhibition staged by the HALO Trust, an anti-landmine charity once championed by his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.

Diana sparked an international outcry
16 years ago when she walked through a live minefield in Angola to 
highlight the shocking legacy of anti-personnel landmines in January 
1997, just months before her tragic death.

But her subsequent calls for a worldwide ban on landmines sparked a global row over the impartiality of the Royal Family.

The senior royal presented Major Simon Beattie with a trophy as the Air Corps' Best Aircraft Commander of the Year

Government ministers reacted with fury, with the then Junior Defence Minister, Earl Howe, describing the princess as ‘ill informed’ and a ‘loose cannon’.

The shocked royal rejected their criticism, insisting she was not a political figure but simply wanted to highlight the scale of the humanitarian disaster.

‘I’m only trying to help,’ she said as she cuddled landmine victim Sandra Txijica. The image went round the world, forever linked to the princess and a powerful symbol of the horrors of war.

Harry has long been keen to take up his mother’s mantle and in 2010 visited Mozambique to learn more about HALO’s work.

During that trip, he meet dozens of people who had lost limbs to landmines and was given the chance to detonate several mines himself, wearing the same protective visor and body armour as his mother.

According to aides, he has been looking for a way to support the charity – which is based in Scotland and has cleared more than 1.4 million landmines since 1988 - more formally ever since. Earlier this year, he became patron of their 25th anniversary appeal.

During his speech, Charles said: 'If it is any consolation, I understand very well just how many demands are faced by service families when you find yourselves required to go here, there and everywhere at short notice'

This evening, the prince will be the guest of honour at a glitzy reception in the gardens of the UK Ambassador’s residence, where he will be introduced to the cream of British society in Washington as well as charity representatives.

The ambassador, Sir Peter Westmacott, will be a familiar face as he served as Prince Charles’s deputy Private Secretary between 1990 and 1993.

Harry will take time to address the 170 guests, his first speech of the tour, before attending a dinner also thrown by the Ambassador for just 30 guests.

Tomorrow, the prince will visit the Arlington National Cemetery, where he will lay a wreath on the graves of those who have recently lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

He will also lay a bouquet of flowers at the grave of legendary murdered former President, JFK.

The main focus of his trip, however, will be the 2013 warrior Games in Colorado Springs this weekend which will see more than 200 wounded servicemen – including a 35-strong British team – compete in seven sports including archery, cycling and shooting.

The prince will formally open the games and may even take part in them himself.

The final leg of his trip will take him to New Jersey, where he will visit an area affected by last year’s Hurricane Sandy, and undertake several engagements in New York including an event on behalf of the British Government.

He will be seen boarding an iconic double decker bus to publicise the GREAT campaign, which is promoting Britain as one of the best places in the world in which to visit, study and invest in.

Harry will also take part in a baseball game  before moving on to Connecticut where he will take part in a celebrity-studded polo match on behalf of his own charity, Sentebale, which he set up to help AIDS orphans in the impoverished African kingdom of Lesotho.

Unlike other members of the Royal Family, the prince will be taking commercial flights to and from the US as well as within it, and has a minimal five-strong entourage plus his security detail.

The cost of his trip will be met largely by his charities but in part by taxpayers as he will be conducting some official business.

Fortunately for his security team, there will be little chance for time off – and certainly no return visit to Vegas – as he will return to the UK as soon as the trip finishes to resume his military duties.
