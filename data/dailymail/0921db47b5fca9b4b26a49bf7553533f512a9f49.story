Authorities in northern California have evacuated homes lying in the path of a fast-growing wild fire northeast of San Francisco.

The blaze on the east side of Mount Diablo, which is being referred to as the Morgan fire, was first reported on Sunday afternoon and has now started spreading into surrounding areas.

Around 400 acres of dry brush and grass have already been devoured in the area southeast of the town of Clayton.

About 175 firefighters, water-dropping 
helicopters and tanker planes carrying flame retardant managed to contain around 10 percent of the blaze.

Julie Hutchinson, a spokesman
for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said 
residents of up to 75 homes were threatened by the blaze and were 
ordered to vacate their property.
