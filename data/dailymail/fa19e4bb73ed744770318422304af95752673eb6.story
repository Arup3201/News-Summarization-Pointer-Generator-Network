Yards from the crashing surf of his ocean home, a humpback whale lies dead in the waters of a public pool.

The sea monster's body washed up on this seaside swimming basin by Newport Beach, in Sydney, Australia, after dying on its journey north to warmer climes.

Whether he was abandoned by his pod or simply couldn't keep up because of age or injury is unclear.

But where waves once splashed and sprayed against his powerful frame, ripples now lap with poignant tranquility.

Watery grave: Metres from the crashing surf of his ocean home, a humpback whale lies dead in the stillest of waters of a public pool

And at 32-feet from tail to snout, he is the exact same length as a London double-decker bus.

But it is now a nervous wait to see if the next high tide will rise enough to reclaim him back into his Pacific heartland.

If not, the New South Wales wildlife authorities must find a way to remove the rotting carcass, which is already beginning to emit a putrid smell.

Whale beachings are common in Australia, but rough seas and a high tide washed the 20 to 30 tonne humpback whale over a chain safety fence late on Tuesday and into a public salt water swimming pool at Sydney's Newport beach.

National Parks authorities said they hope the whale carcass might float out of the pool area on the next high tide. Otherwise, workers might have to bring in a crane to remove the whale and then carve up the carcass.

Northern route: Humpbacks are a regular sight along Australia's east coast as they head north to warmer breeding waters in June and July, often coming close to shore when feeding

Humpbacks are a regular sight along Australia's east coast as they head north to warmer breeding waters in June and July, often coming close to shore when feeding.

Whales usually return to feeding waters in Antarctica between September and November.

One swimmer told Australian radio he saw the whale when he turned up for his regular morning dip.

'I swim every day and I'm not sharing my lane with that,' he said.
