Lindsay Lohan just can't seem to catch a break.

Fresh out of a 90-day stint at the Cliffside Malibu Rehab Center and reportedly 'doing amazing'  as she spends a few days in a sober living facility as she adjusts to life back in the spotlight, she has been dealt another blow.

Ahead of the August 2 release of her new movie, The Canyons, the film's screenwriter, Bret Easton Ellis, has labelled the star 'mixed up', 'scattered' and 'bossy'.

Back in the spotlight: She may be freshly out of rehab, but Lindsay Lohan's woes are far from over - with Bret Easton Ellis, the screenwriter of her new film, The Canyons, labelling her 'mixed up', 'scattered' and 'bossy'

In a candid interview with New York website Gawker, Bret revealed that his time on set with the 27-year-old was fraught with lateness and nervousness on the actress's part.

A former drug user himself, he puts a lot of Lindsay's behaviour down to her Adderall dependency.

'She’s a very mixed up 20-something,' he says, adding of their first encounter on set, 'She was late, she was a little scattered, we had nervous small talk, and then she turned it on immediately.'

Hostile co-stars: James Deen has said that working with Lindsay on The Canyons was like working with 'a child' - a sentiment echoed by the film's director, Paul Schrader

'She was sometimes bossy - I don’t know if that’s the Adderall.'

It wasn't all bad, though, with the American Psycho author admitting that he 'genuinely liked her' and she has real talent.

'[Lindsay's] very knowledgeable about film and composition and lighting and hitting your mark. When she did our first table read, she blew me away,' he raved.

Not all bad: Bret Easton Ellis - pictured here in 2010 - also said the actress 'blew me away', at her initial table read, and that he 'genuinely liked her'

'I don’t see her as lost. I know a lot of
20-somethings and they’re all messed up. But when you’re out in the 
public, you’re magnified 100 per cent, and I can understand how you’d go
a little bit further. But she was ultimately very nice.'

However, the film's director, Paul Schrader, told a very different story of his experience working with the troubled star earlier this month.

According to RadarOnline, he was quoted as saying that 'tardiness, tantrums, absences, neediness, psychodrama' plagued the shoot.

Not over yet: She looked happy to leave Cliffside Malibu Rehab Center on Tuesday, but on their advice to the judge in her probation case, Lindsay must attend three 50-minute therapy sessions a week for 16 months

A sentiment echoed by Lindsay's co-star, James Deen - Farrah Abraham's sex-tape partner and porn star - who reportedly said working with the actress was akin to working with 'a child'.

The bad rap from her colleagues comes just days after Variety gave the actress a rave review on July 28, saying she has a 'fascinating presence' and is 'affecting' in her role, to which she tweeted the response, 'Wow...humbled and feeling so much gratitude'.

Meanwhile, Lindsay may have left rehab on Tuesday beaming from ear to ear, but it has since been revealed that staff at the rehab facility are fearful that she will return to her old ways.

In a letter obtained by TMZ, Cliffside Malibu Rehab Center CEO and founder Richard Taite recommended to the judge in Lilo's probation case that she be issued with court-ordered therapy.

On the home stretch: Lilo's lawyer, Shawn Holley, says it was the star's decision to have a sober companion and she is 'doing well', adding, 'She is so positive and [wants to get] her life on the right track'

'Our entire clinical team is in 
unanimous agreement that if these sessions are not required by the court
and attendance verified once a month to ensure accountability, it is a 
set up for almost certain failure,' was the ominous warning given to 
Judge James R Dabney.

In
open court this morning, the judge agreed to the recommendation terms, 
which state that Lindsay must participate in three 50-minute therapy 
sessions per week for the next 16 months.

'This
should be done face-to-face while she is in town and via Skype or phone
session if she is out of town,' the document specifies.

Leading lady: The 27-year-old tweeted, 'Wow...humbled and feeling so much gratitude,' on July 28 after Variety referred to her as having a 'fascinating presence' and being 'affecting' in The Canyons

Speaking to E! News, her lawyer, Shawn Holley, says the star is determined to stay out of trouble this time around, adding, 'It was [Lindsay's] idea to have a sober coach with her. She is doing well. She is so positive and [wants to get] her life on the right track.'

Lindsay's father, Michael Lohan, has also publicly praised his daughter, revealing he is 'very, very proud of what she's accomplished, how far she's come and how seriously she's taking her sobriety and her future'.

Lindsay's three-month treatment sentence for substance abuse issues stems from a June 2012 car accident, in which she plead no contest to charges of lying to police about being behind the wheel.
