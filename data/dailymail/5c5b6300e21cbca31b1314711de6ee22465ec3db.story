Some parents intent on being different have thrown out the most common baby names this year in favor of some very peculiar monikers.

At least three newborns were named Cheese this year, for example. And that’s just the boys.

On the girls side came such out-of-left field choices as Kukua and Kiwi.

Odd man out:  While searching for the most popular baby names of 2013, the website BabyCenter stumbled upon some of the weirdest

The parenting website BabyCenter put together their list of the most common baby names of the year after surveying half a million parents.

While the decidedly unscientific method of simply asking around yielded some expected results—Sophia, Emma, Olivia, Jackson, and Aiden top among them—it also uncovered some oddities.

The survey found that at least three parents out of the half a million had named their new baby things like Cheese, Thirdy, Enno, and Rocket.

And those are just a few of the stranger boys names.

My son the car: At least three parents named their sons after the Chevrolet motor company in 2013

The weird girl names include Archita, Blip, Nyx, and Ezgi.

While some seem random, others among the bizarre names have a familiar ring to them.

Wrigley, for instance, conjures images of the glory days of baseball in Chicago. Though it should be noted, it’s on the girl list.

Ajax isn’t just a bath and tile scrub but also a classical soldier’s name. It’s on the boy list.

Two for one: For girls, Wrigley was named as one of the oddest baby names of the year. And Cub was one of the boy names

In addition to Cheese, other food related names include Danish, Kiwi and Chow.

Bears were also a popular inspiration. Included on the weird name list were Cub, Kodiak, and Panda (all boys).

Like the top names in BabyCenter’s survey, the bottom names are just a guess at the oddest names of 2013. The official list won’t be released until May.

However, the top names will likely be the names we see popping up everywhere like Ava, Zoe, Lily, Aiden, and Mason.

The list of weirdest names, on the other hand, is likely to get both longer and stranger.
