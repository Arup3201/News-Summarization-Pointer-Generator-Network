A wealthy academic was today cleared of assaulting her children’s nanny and smashing her mobile phone after they clashed in the street.

Rebecca Forsyth, 29, claimed Chinese-born Dr Ping Zhu, 58, twisted her arm behind her back and broke her mobile phone after she tried to film her on her BlackBerry.

Miss Forsyth claimed she had been ‘bullied and harassed' by Dr Zhu and wanted to capture her screaming and shouting on film.

But Westminster Magistrates' Court 
heard she was 'seeking to provoke a situation' during the incident at Dr
 Zhu's home in Bayswater, west London.

It
 also emerged there was no evidence that Miss Forsyth's wrist had been 
hurt during the tussle which resulted in police being called on November
 12 last year.

Miss 
Forsyth, who was employed by Dr Zhu’s ex-husband to care for the 
couple’s two sons, arrived at the defendant's flat and began to film her
 when she answered the door.

The London-born nanny claimed that Dr Zhu became angry and called her a 'dirty s***'.

But the mobile phone footage, which was shown in court, revealed Miss Forsyth shouting 'Come on, come on' at the academic.

Tim
 Moloney, defending, said today: 'There is absolutely no doubt that this
 incident was instigated by Miss Forsyth, walking towards Miss Zhu, 
holding the mobile phone as she advanced to stop the filming.'

'She said: 'Come on, come on'. Hardly clean hands.'

District judge Vanessa Lloyd threw the case out after finding that Miss Forsyth's evidence was 'unreliable'.

She added: 'There is no case to answer.'

Dr Zhu had denied the charges of assault and criminal damage.

On the footage, Miss Forsyth could be heard saying 'Get off my phone now, give me my phone. I'm going to call the police'.

Dr Zhu is heard responding: 'Do call the police. Why you do this to me? Are you cruel?'

Miss Forsyth, wearing blue skinny jeans and a black blazer, told the court: 'The reason I picked up my phone was I was pretty sure (Dr Zhu) was going to start shouting at me, like she had every time in the past for the last year - screaming malicious abuse at me in front of people.

'As far as I was concerned, I was being bullied out of my job. I was seeking legal advice at the time because no one was there to support me.

'I was being harassed at work.'

But Mr Moloney, defending, said: 'You wanted to provoke her so that you could either sue her or get her arrested didn't you?'

He added: 'She hadn't said anything to you before you took the phone out, had she?'

Dr Zhu, wearing a black skirt and cream and pink scarf, smiled as she walked free from the dock.

Miss Forsyth told the Mail outside court: 'My life has been ruined by this. I cannot get any other work.'
