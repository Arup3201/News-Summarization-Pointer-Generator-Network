A Marriot hotel in San Diego has been labelled ‘tacky’ and ‘insensitive’ after it choose to ‘honor’ the memory of those who died in the 9/11 terror attacks by offering patrons free mini muffins and coffee for thirty minutes on Wednesday morning.

Staff at the San Diego Marriott Mission Valley hotel decided mini muffins would be an appropriate way for the hotel to commemorate the loss of nearly 3,000 people on this day in 2001.

A poster was printed up and placed in the hotel which read: 'In remembrance of those we lost on 9/11 the hotel will provide complimentary coffee and mini muffins from 8.45 - 9.15am.’

Twitter user @eclectrica posted this photograph of a sign offering patrons free mini muffins and coffee 'in remembrance' of the people who lost their lives on 9/11

On an emotional day for so many around the country, the San Diego Marriott Mission Valley hotel decided mini muffins would be an appropriate way for the hotel to commemorate the loss of nearly 3,000 people in 2001

The timing of the free offer coincided almost exactly with 8:46 a.m., the time when the first plane hit the twin towers 12 years ago, and the same time as a moment of silence was being observed at ground zero by relatives of the victims of the terrorist atrocity and by the President and first lady at the White House.

One guest at the hotel, stunned at the what they’d seen took a photo of the sign and posted it online using their twitter handle @eclectrica.

The photo has attracted a barrage of negative reactions from Twitter users, and the idea of offering free anything in response to one of the darkest moments in America’s recent history has been described as a ‘marketing gaffe,’ ‘crass,’ ‘insensitive’ and ‘embarrassing.’

Other people have poked fun tweeting that it wasn’t even full-size muffins and they were free only for one half an hour.

When MailOnline contacted the hotel, the general manager’s assistant said she didn’t see what was wrong with commemorating 9/11 in such a way. The hotel's general manager Erikk Hilgert has yet to respond to a request for comment.

The chain’s corporate office was quicker to respond and issued a statement in which it apologized, but also quick to point out that the decision had been taken independently by the hotel.

‘We are aware of the picture that was tweeted. It shows an offer that was made independently by the hotel and not the Marriott Hotels brand.

‘As far as we know, it was limited to one property. While the hotel was making a sympathetic gesture to its guests in remembrance of 9/11, we apologize and understand why some people may have misunderstood the intent of the offer. We are reminding our hotels to use discretion and be sensitive when remembering major events such as 9/11.’

Marketing gaffe: Not long after AT&T tweeted this image of a cellphone featuring a photo of the 'Tribute in Light' it deleted the post and quickly attempted to apologize

Companies including AT&T and Marriott have made ill-advised attempts to use the 12th anniversary of 9/11 for their own commercial gains or as a tacky marketing exercise

Marriott isn’t the only company to 
have misjudged the general public’s react to 9/11-related offers, no 
matter how well intended they claim to be.

AT&T
tweeted an image of the Tribute in Light, the art installation which 
creates two vertical columns of light next to the site of the World 
Trade Center, which was almost an advert for its smartphone which was 
very prominent in the image.

Not long after AT&T tweeted the image it deleting it and quickly attempted to apologize.

‘We
apologize to anyone who felt our post was in poor taste. The image was 
solely meant to pay respect to those affected by the 9/11 tragedy.’

A golf course in Verona, Wisconsin, was another company to make an ill-advised reference to 9/11 in its marketing materials.
