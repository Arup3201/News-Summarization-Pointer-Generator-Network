A Canadian-born author has given a frank description of her foreign exchange to Germany as a teenager - and her host family's penchant for 'jiggling, dangling' naked basketball.

Lydia Millet says the West Berlin-based teacher and engineer she was sent to stay with for three months in 1984, and their teenage son and daughter, seemed normal at first.

Until she discovered they were all very active members of a group called 'Free Body Culture' - a nearby nudist club - and her joining them on their weekend jaunts was non-negotiable.

'The nudist outings were going to be pretty much mandatory, my hosts explained to me—much like speaking the language or eating the food,' Millet wrote in an article in The Wall Street Journal. 'The family felt strongly that, to properly explore their native ways, I needed to join in the nudist activities.'

After a few hours of convincing, she says 'I shrugged my shoulders, suppressed my panic and acquiesced.'

The nudist camp consisted of a lake, grassy fields covered in goose and duck droppings and a few trees. And hundreds of naked Germans, who more than anything were there to top up their tans, she recalled.

Once she got the hang of the rules - don't ogle people below the neck mid-conversation (though sneaking a peak after is fine) - she relaxed. And then they started playing basketball.

'We wore nothing but sneakers,' she wrote in the article.
'No brassieres, no jockstraps. There was flopping, and there was pain. 
There was the sight of nude people, bouncing and swinging above bulky 
white athletic shoes.

'Could this be the wonder my German family had talked about, the beauty of the unclad human form? Was this jiggling, dangling dance with a large, orange ball indeed our highest, purest identity?'

But despite the bare ball games, Millet says she looks back on her forced Free Body Culture experience fondly.

'In the end, the Germans were absolutely right,' she wrote in the newspaper.

'The Free Body Culture gave me a gift I might never have received had I refused to play along. It left me with an acute sense of the absurd—one I still cherish—to be there among my fellow apes, awkward and less than half-willing, aiming and missing, leaping, landing and wincing.'
