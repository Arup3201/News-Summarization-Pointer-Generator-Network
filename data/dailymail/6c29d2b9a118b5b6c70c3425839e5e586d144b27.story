Photographers could enter single images or themed portfolios of six.

There are over £13,000 worth of cash prizes and medals from the Royal Photographic Society.

International Garden Photographer of the Year judge Clive Nichols said of the overall winner: 'This stunning image of Hydrangea petiolaris is a worthy winner.

'What I particularly like about the shot is the way the photographer has melted the rich purples and oranges of the hydrangea into the out of focus background, creating a delicious melange of colours.

'The focus on the single delicate hydrangea flower is spot on, creating a striking and unusual winter portrait'.

Organised in conjunction with the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, the photographers will have their work taken on tour and published in a book.

Garden Photographer of the Year was set up by five members of the Garden Photographers' Association in 2007.

As a response to entries and enquiries from outside Great Britain, it added 'International' to the title in 2008.

Its first exhibition took place at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in May 2008 and quickly established itself as the world's premier garden and plant photography event specialising in garden, plant, flower and botanical photography.

The competition is open to everyone anywhere in the world.

Images do not have to be taken in a specified year and there is no distinction drawn between professional and amateur photographers.

This year's exhibition will be launched on Saturday at Kew Gardens and runs until April 6.

It will then go on tour, stopping at Cyprus, Sydney, Portugal, Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh, Sheringham Park Norfolk, Ness Botanic Garden, Wirral and Tintinhull Garden, Somerset.

There is also a book available of the exhibition.
