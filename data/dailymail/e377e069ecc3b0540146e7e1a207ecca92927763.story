The inspiration for Chanel's Metiers d'Art traveling fashion show this year will come from Dallas, the Texas city where Coco Chanel was once given a warm welcome that included being picked up at the airport in a white Rolls-Royce and being feted at a Western-themed party complete with a catwalk featuring cows.

For more than a decade, designer Karl Lagerfeld has picked a city linked to the house for the theme of the show staged each December to highlight the work of its artisans.

On Tuesday evening, it will be the turn for the city that fashion house founder Gabrielle 'Coco' Chanel visited in 1957 at the invitation of Stanley Marcus, who led Neiman Marcus, the Dallas-based luxury retailer founded by his family.

'It's
 going to be over the top and it's going to be spectacular,' said Neiman
 Marcus fashion director Ken Downing. 'It's going to be a big fashion 
moment here in Dallas.

'I'm
 anticipating that we're going to see a lot of Dallas and certainly a 
lot of Texas and the American West translated into the collection.'

The
 show that will be held at Dallas' Art Deco exhibition venue Fair Park 
will begin with the premiere of a film written and directed by Lagerfeld
 titled, 'The Return,' that retraces the steps of Coco Chanel as she 
reopened her Paris couture house in 1954 after shuttering it as Europe 
entered World War II. Her return wasn't well-received by the French 
press, but was embraced by the Americans.

Neiman Marcus was among
 those that lauded her return, with a special appreciation for the suits
 that her name is now synonymous with.

'They thought it was 
wonderful and perfect for the modern American customer,' said Myra 
Walker, director of the Texas Fashion Collection, an assemblage of 
thousands of clothing items housed at the University of North Texas that
 had its genesis with the Marcus family.

'Women look good in it. You can
 wear it to lunch or you can dress it up for the evening.'

'It was very much Mr Stanley's way of introducing the world to Dallas and Dallas to the world'

During
 Coco Chanel's September 1957 trip to Dallas - only three years after 
the return of her fashion house - she was given the Neiman Marcus Award 
for Distinguished Service in the Field of Fashion.

The next month, 
Neiman Marcus, celebrating its 50th anniversary that year, launched the 
Fortnight celebrations, which became famous for bringing festivities and
 offerings inspired by a certain country to the city. With the title 
'France Comes to Texas,' the celebration included turning the downtown 
store's facade into a re-creation of shops along a Paris street.

'It was very much Mr. Stanley's way of introducing the world to Dallas and Dallas to the world,' Downing said.

Marcus,
 who died in 2002 at 96, would have been thrilled that Lagerfeld was 
bringing his international show to Dallas, Walker said. 'This is the 
kind of thing he worked toward.'

Photos from Coco Chanel's visit 
include her posing for a picture with a Western-attired Marcus and his 
wife at the party at a ranch where she took in the cow fashion show in 
addition to watching square dancers. She was also snapped inspecting a 
hat on her tour of the store.

'She was very mesmerized by the 
idea of Texas, so they threw a barbecue for her,' Downing said.

'The 
story goes she actually didn't like the taste of the barbecue, and she 
tossed her plate under the table, which, as the story goes, it went all 
over Elizabeth Arden's red satin shoes.'

In Marcus' speech as he 
bestowed Coco Chanel with the award, he called her 'the great innovator 
who emancipated the feminine silhouette' and noted she was the first to 
recognize 'that the casualness of the 20th century must be reflected in 
the clothes women wear.'

In another tie to the Lone Star State, 
when Coco Chanel came to Dallas, she was accompanied by her famous model
 and muse Suzy Parker, a San Antonio native.

The film will be 
shown at the same time on Chanel's website at its premiere here. It 
follows the Lagerfeld's film 'Once Upon a Time ...' that explores Coco 
Chanel's early days in fashion in Deauville on the French Riviera. That 
film debuted last May in Singapore.

Other cities that have served
 as inspiration for the Metiers d'Art show include Tokyo, New York, 
London, Shanghai and Edinburgh, Scotland. The collection, which will be 
in boutiques in May, highlights the work of the artisans who are part of
 a Chanel subsidiary company, including a costume jewelry and button 
maker, a feather and flower maker, a milliner, shoemaker, glovemaker and
 embroiderers.
