Targeting the 'hunger' nerve may help obese people lose weight, according to scientists.

Researchers from the University of Minneapolis have created a new device which uses electrodes to block the vagus nerve from communicating the feelings of hunger to the brain.

Their aim was to develop a new treatment for obesity, as effective as bariatric surgery, but less invasive and without the  risks.

Researchers found that blocking the vagus nerve- which communicates feelings of hunger- did lead to weight loss in a study of obese people, but wasn't as effective as hoped

The vagus nerve runs the length of a person's torso, from the brain to the abdomen and tells the body when it is full.

But in obese people, studies have shown that the vagus nerve becomes desensitised, causing them to overeat.

The U.S. researchers took 239 severely obese participants whose body mass index’s (BMI) were between 35 and 45, and who had one or more obesity-related condition. 

They implanted the device, blocking the vagus nerve in 162 of the participants.

The other 77 participants had a ‘sham’ device implanted, which was inactive and did not block the vagus nerve. They were used as the control group.

Both groups underwent a course on weight management.

The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that the device blocking the vagus nerve was mildly effective in reducing weight over the short term. 

After 12 months, those with the device fitted lost an average of 24 per cent of their excess weight, while those in the control group without the device fitted lost only 16 per cent.

Looking specifically at the group with the device fitted, researchers found 52 per cent of these participants lost a fifth of their excess weight, while 38 per cent lost at least a quarter of their excess weight.

Therefore though there was certainly weight loss, the procedure fell short of being as effective as the researchers had hoped.

The study concluded: ‘Additional studies are needed to compare effectiveness of vagal nerve block with other obesity treatments and to assess long­ term durability of weight loss and safety.'
