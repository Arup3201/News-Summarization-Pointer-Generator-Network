A woman who asked Joe Biden a question on gun control during an online debate said yesterday that she found the vice president's reply 'poor advice' and 'sexist.'

During the town hall on Tuesday Kate Ernest put to Biden: 'Do you believe that banning certain weapons and high capacity 
magazines will mean that law-abiding citizens will then become more of a
target to criminals as we will have no way to sufficiently protect 
ourselves?'

Biden told Ernest to 'buy a shotgun', advice she felt was dismissive.

When Ernest asked the question, Biden
laughed and said that he has told his wife, Jill Biden: 'Jill, if 
there’s ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony, put that 
double-barrel shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house.'

The vice president claimed that this would deter possible intruders and that homeowners don't need weapons like the AR-15 rifle.

'It’s harder to aim, it’s harder to use, and in fact you don’t need 30 rounds to protect yourself. Buy a shotgun,' Biden advised.

Ernest
appeared on Fox News yesterday saying that this was 'poorest advice he 
could give anyone' as shotguns only hold two rounds.

Advice: The vice president said that he has told his wife, Jill Biden: 'Jill, if there¿s ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony, put that double-barrel shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house.'

Ernest says that, hypothetically, once Biden's wife gone out into plain sight and fired these two shots, she would then be a 'sitting duck.'

The woman then added that the vice president's suggestion 'comes off a little sexist.'

'Like, "let me tell you what you need" versus, you know, "arm yourself or protect yourself in a way that you feel necessary,"' Ernest said.

As it happens, the vice president's advice could also land his wife behind bars. As reported by US News, in Delaware, where the Bidens live, it is illegal to fire a gun unless the situation is genuinely dangerous.

A Delaware Police sergeant told US News that residents are not allowed to shoot trespassers. 'On your property you can't just shoot someone,' he said. 'You have to really feel that your life is being threatened.'
