Stuart Lancaster and Andy Farrell will be in Salford to watch the first head-to-head in what promises to be an intriguing early-season tussle for England fly-half places.

The two national coaches will be fascinated spectators at the AJ Bell Stadium as Danny Cipriani and George Ford lock horns when Sale take on Bath. The pair will be aiming to guide their sides to an opening win in the Aviva Premiership, but also score personal points ahead of next month’s belated naming of the senior EPS squad for the autumn international campaign. 

Cipriani will be out to continue the positive momentum which propelled him back into the Red Rose ranks at the end of last season.

Fly-half: Sale Sharks man Danny Cipriani is hoping to seal his place as England's fly-half 

Having done enough to convince Lancaster and his assistants that he had the requisite attitude to go with his considerable talent, he was picked for the tour of New Zealand and fared well with encouraging cameos in the first and third Tests, and a fine game against the Crusaders.

In contrast, Ford is playing catch-up as he seeks to re-establish his own burgeoning credentials. The 21-year-old had climbed to the status of first reserve during the Six Nations – ending the tournament with a glittering contribution off the bench against Italy in Rome. 

Yet, just as the Bath tyro seemed destined to go to New Zealand as first-choice for the series opener, in the temporary absence of Owen Farrell, he aggravated a shoulder injury and was told he needed surgery.

Forced to watch the tour from afar, he saw Freddie Burns and Cipriani push their selection case. It left him driven to respond at the start of this season, in the knowledge Stephen Myler of Northampton is also in the England mix.

Competition: George Ford is playing catch-up as he seeks to re-establish himself after his injury

Statement: Has Cipriani done enough to convince Lancaster  he has the attitude to go with his  talent?

Burns will make his competitive debut for Leicester against Newcastle at Welford Road today, with his own agendas to address. He will be desperate to show more of the composed form he produced against the All Blacks in Auckland, to move on from an altogether more chastening experience in Hamilton two weeks later. And he will be striving to fend off the challenge for the Tigers playmaker role posed by Welshman Owen Williams, who is available again after serving a ban.

Williams was sufficiently convincing in his work in the shadow of Toby Flood last season that the rookie ultimately ousted the far more experienced England stand-off from the Leicester XV. He was on course to go to South Africa with Wales in June, until being suspended for gouging Luther Burrell in the Tigers’ Premiership semi-final defeat at Franklin’s Gardens.

Options: As well as Cipriani and Ford, Freddie Burns and Stephen Myler are other options for Lancaster

England forwards coach Graham Rowntree will be at Welford Road but, rather than focusing on the scrap for the hosts’ fly half berth, his eye will be drawn to more earthy matters up front. He will monitor Tom Youngs’ return to action after the Leicester hooker missed the New Zealand trip on compassionate grounds. Newcastle replacement props Kieran Brookes and Scott Wilson will also come under scrutiny.

James Haskell admits he will be inspired by Lawrence Dallaglio when he leads Wasps for the 2014-15 season. Haskell’s first taste of captaincy will be today’s opening match of the traditional Aviva Premiership London double-header against Saracens at Twickenham.

Haskell played alongside Dallaglio for six years. He said: ‘To me Lawrence was everything you want in a leader. I’m not trying to be Lawrence won’t copy him. You can’t help but be inspired by a guy who was a natural leader and had respect from people.’
