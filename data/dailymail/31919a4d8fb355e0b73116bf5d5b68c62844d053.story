Some footballers find it difficult to acclimatise to life at a new club in a new country, but Chelsea's Juan Cuadrado can at least rely on some old friends to keep him company.

The Colombian winger has a weekend off with Chelsea already knocked out of the FA Cup and that gave him the opportunity to catch up with international team-mates in the form of Arsenal's David Ospina and Real Madrid's James Rodriguez.

The trio all impressed enough at last summer's World Cup to earn big-money moves but despite all the uprooting in their lives it seems they are still able to make time for each other.

Cuadrado started for his new club for the first time in Chelsea's 1-0 win over Everton on Wednesday ahead of Tuesday's Champions League trip to Paris-Saint Germain.

And while Rodriguez is currently out injured, Ospina has had an increased role at Arsenal in place ofÂ Wojciech Szczesny - although he will be rested for the FA Cup visit of Middlesbrough.
