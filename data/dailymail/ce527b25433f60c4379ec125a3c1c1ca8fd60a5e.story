Kate Middleton might touring New Zealand, but Princess Eugenie charmed New York yesterday as she attended the launch of a new parenting app.

Joined by pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Trachtenberg at the Manhattan event, 24-year-old Princess Eugenie smiled and posed happily for pictures.

The Baby Bundle App - free for iPhones and iPads - tracks babies eating, sleeping and nappy changes.

It can also record and remind you of doctorâ€™s appointments, vaccinations and your babyâ€™s growth and has a breast-feeding timer.

Princess Eugenie wrapped up against 
the New York chill, wearing a stylish long grey coat, accessorised with a
 brightly coloured scarf.

Also attending the launch were mother and former Gossip Girl actress Kelly Rutherford, Nick von Christierson, Prince Philippos of Greece and Anthony von Christierson.

Accidents: Expert Answers to the Questions Parents Ask Most.

Before
 flying out to the States Princess Eugenie visited the High Dependency 
Unit at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital last week.

It was the hospital where she had undergone spinal surgery when she was 12.
