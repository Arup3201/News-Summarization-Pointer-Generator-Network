Two elderly patients die every week after falling over in hospital, a report shows.

Nearly 209,000 falls were recorded in hospitals in England last year, with 900 patients suffering severe harm such as hip fractures and head injuries, and 90 patients dying.

Many elderly patients worry about pressing the call button for help in going to the bathroom because they do not want to be any trouble.

New guidelines from NICE – the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence – say medics must encourage vulnerable patients to use the bedside calling system.

Damien Longson, a consultant psychiatrist who led the NICE panel, said: ‘Many patients who need extra support in carrying out simple tasks, such as reaching to get a drink or going to the bathroom, do not wish to make a fuss or to be seen as a burden to staff.

‘This can lead to them attempting to carry out these activities independently, which puts them at a greater risk of falling.

In doing so, they can cause themselves significant harm and end up staying longer in hospital than they otherwise would have needed to.

‘The NICE guideline advises doctors and nurses to reassure their patients that it is OK for them to press the call button, and that they are there to help them if needed.’

Vulnerable: Doctors are advised to consider all patients aged over 65 to be at high risk of falling over

Nurses and doctors are advised to consider all patients aged 65 years and older to be at high risk of  falling over.

The same warning goes for those of 50 and above with dementia, stroke, vision or hearing problems and other underlying conditions.

Doctors and nurses should create a plan to cut each patient’s chances of falling while in their care – for example by adjusting their medication, offering alternative footwear and helping them go to the lavatory.

Research shows the psychological impact of falling can have a devastating effect on the confidence and independence of older people, often increasing feelings of isolation and depression.

Half of those with a hip fracture never regain their former level of function and one in five die within three months.

Mark Baker, of the centre for clinical practice at NICE, said: ‘Falling over is a serious problem in hospitals, and unfortunately their likelihood increases with age as people become frailer.

'They can cause distress, pain, injury, a loss of confidence and independence, and in some cases, death.

‘While it would be virtually impossible to prevent all hospital falls from happening, our guideline calls for doctors and nurses to address the issues that will reduce the risk of their patients suffering avoidable harm. No two patients are the same and so a “one size fits all” approach will not work.’

Hospital staff will be asked to consider factors that make a fall more likely, such as previous mishaps, types of medication and eyesight or balance problems.

Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘Falls can make an already distressing time even more difficult for vulnerable patients, and any advice and support which helps reduce these incidents is good news for staff and patients.’

Michelle Mitchell, of Age UK, said the consequences of a fall in later life can be devastating for patients. She added: ‘In addition to the pain caused to the individual, falls cost around £6million a day in hospital and social care costs.

‘Implementing these new guidelines to reduce falls in hospitals must be a priority for our Health Service, not only to improve patient safety, but to help save precious NHS resources.’
