Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale was controversially banned from receiving the biggest prize in county cricket yesterday and could be facing further punishment over the unsavoury clash with Ashwell Prince that ended his season.

Yorkshire’s first title success for 13 years was tainted when their captain was stopped by the ECB from taking any part in the presentation ceremony after their thumping victory against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge.

The move, which followed Gale’s ban last week for verbally abusing Lancashire’s Prince, angered Yorkshire and their captain, who was said to be in tears in the dressing room while his stand-in Joe Root received the trophy. Yet the ECB, who came under fire for being too harsh on Gale, last night released a statement which made it clear that the player could be in further trouble over the exact nature of what he said to South African Prince.

It read: ‘After an incident in the match between Lancashire and Yorkshire the ECB made a complaint to the cricket discipline commission about the conduct of Andrew Gale. In these circumstances it was not felt appropriate for Mr Gale to be involved in the presentation.’

Gale, highly regarded for his leadership of Yorkshire, risked upsetting the ECB further by going on to the Trent Bridge outfield and lifting the trophy after the official presentation when he was urged to do so by his county’s support. He also looked emotional while carrying his daughter around the outfield. ‘We only found out he couldn’t lift the trophy last night,’ said Martyn Moxon, the Yorkshire director of cricket. ‘We can’t say anything else because there’s a legal process going on. It’s been hard for Andrew because he’s cherished the win and was looking forward to this moment.’

Gale, no stranger to disciplinary problems for dissent, was banned until September 27 after clashing with Prince. Sportsmail understands he made reference to the South African’s Kolpak status, which allows him to play for Lancashire as a non-overseas player.

It is the precise nature of what else Gale, a former England Lions captain, said that has led to the risk of him being in serious trouble and subsequently air-brushed out of the celebrations.

In Gale’s absence Yorkshire needed just over an hour of the final day to take the remaining five Notts wickets, four of them falling to the evergreen Ryan Sidebottom, and clinch the title with a match to go.

It is a notable triumph for a county in serious financial trouble until being rescued by chairman Colin Graves, who is also the deputy chairman of the ECB. Graves said yesterday Jason Gillespie, who was made coach when Yorkshire were relegated three years ago, was the catalyst for success.
