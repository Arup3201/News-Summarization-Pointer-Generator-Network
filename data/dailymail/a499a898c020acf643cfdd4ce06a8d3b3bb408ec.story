Delays in restarting four key nuclear power stations after a safety shutdown could bring an electricity crisis this winter.

The shutdowns have dangerously narrowed the gap between demand and the amount which National Grid can supply to homes and businesses.

The squeeze is now likely to step up the regime where major energy users, such as factories, are paid millions to shut down in peak evening periods.

Showdown: Fears over winter supplies were prompted by the temporary shutdown of four nuclear reactors at Heysham (pictured) and Hartlepool, which are owned by EDF Energy. A crack was found in a boiler

This strict measure is vital to protect homes and families by ensuring there is enough electricity on the grid to keep the lights and heating on.

Separately, National Grid has asked power firms to boost supplies this winter to cover the threatened shortfall.

The problems will be seen as further evidence that Britain’s dilapidated energy supply system cannot meet the nation’s needs. Critics will also point to the decision to spend billions on green energy.

Fears over winter supplies were prompted by the temporary shutdown of four nuclear reactors at Heysham and Hartlepool owned by EDF Energy.

A crack was found in a boiler at one of them in August and the closure was initially expected to be short term.

But now the French power giant is warning there will be only be a ‘phased return’ between the end of October and the end of December.

Analyst Peter Atherton, of Liberum Capital, said: ‘These are old reactors and when you go to solve one problem, you often find another you didn’t know about.

‘That could put them out of action for months. Losing these power stations also means we have lost the very small amount of fat in the system.

Supply lines: There were also doubts after a fire at the Ferrybridge coal-fired power station in West Yorkshire

‘If the weather’s unusually bad or there isn’t enough wind or something else goes wrong, then we will be cutting it to the bone.’

Regulator Ofgem and National Grid, which runs the power distribution network, will pay major energy users £75million in the next two years to turn off lights and machines on weekday winter afternoons. The cost will go on to the bills of homes and businesses.

Jeremy Nicholson, director of the Energy Intensive Users Group, said this sort of drastic action might be expected in a Third World nation.

‘This can’t be a sustainable way of managing the energy system,’ he added. ‘Industry has to have access to secure power supplies.’

Dr Adam Marshall, of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘For too long, the UK has failed to plan adequately to guarantee the energy supplies required for our economy, businesses and consumers.’

On Tuesday, National Grid said it was tendering for extra electricity supplies for winter ‘owing to uncertainty over plant availability’.

Ministers are relying on nuclear power to provide low carbon energy, alongside wind farms, as a replacement for coal-fired plants that are closing to meet EU targets on cutting greenhouse gases.

On top of the loss of the four EDF plants, other supplies have been put in doubt by fires at power stations in Ferrybridge, West Yorkshire, and Ironbridge, Shropshire.
