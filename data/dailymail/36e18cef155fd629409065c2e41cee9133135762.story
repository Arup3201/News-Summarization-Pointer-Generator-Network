Marilyn Manson has denied any involvement in the controversial film that emerged yesterday, thought to directed by Eli Roth, which sees Lana Del Rey in a violent rape scene, cut with footage of the Goth rocker.

Mr Roth appeared to refer to the newly-released film back in 2013 when he told Larry King in an interview: 'I shot a video with Marilyn Manson and Lana Del Rey,' and added, 'the footage is so sick, it's been locked in a vault for over a year.' 

'Manson did not direct this, shoot it, nor was it for a Marilyn Manson video or outtake footage made by him or to be used by him with his music,' Manson's representative Kathryn Frazier told Billboard.

Disturbing: Marilyn Manson has denied any involvement in the controversial film that emerged yesterday, previously thought to have been a collaboration directed by Eli Roth, which sees Lana Del Rey in a violent rape scene (pictured)

Mystery: Mr Roth (right) appeared to refer to the newly-released film back in 2013, when he told Larry King in an interview: 'I shot a video with Marilyn Manson and Lana Del Rey,' and added, 'the footage is so sick, it's been locked in a vault for over a year'

Ms Frazier added: 'It must be a fan video splicing up old Manson video footage with someone else's Lana Del Rey footage.'

No comment has yet been issued from Miss Del Rey's camp or Mr Roth's.

The controversial film was posted to YouTube yesterday by Sturmgruppe - a production house which has produced content for Mr Manson, 45, in the past - but it has since been removed, along with Sturmgruppe's website.  

The film sees a struggling, weeping Miss Del Rey,  29, clad in a Texas Chainsaw Massacre T-Shirt and boy-shorts, forced onto a bed and sexually assaulted by an aggressive man.

It contains several separate scenes starring Mr Manson, which also appear in one of his former music videos, No Reflection, directed by Lukas Ettlin.

It therefore remains unclear who shot the footage of Miss Del Rey, despite Mr Roth appearing to take credit previously.

Violent: The attacker slams Miss Del Rey's face into the pillow

Struggle: The two minute film has no music, only haunting sound effects

During Mr Roth's aforementioned 2013 interview, Larry King reads out a question from a fan, asking whether Mr Roth would ever consider working with Mr Manson, since the pair are known to be acquainted.

'Yes actually,' grins Mr Roth. 'I shot a video with Marilyn Manson and Lana Del Rey. Marilyn Manson is the best, he's one of my favorite people. He's a friend, he actually came to my Passover Sader.'

Mr Roth added: 'The footage is so sick, it's been locked in a vault for over a year.'

Unrelated? Mr Manson's rep suggested, 'It must be a fan video splicing up old Manson video footage with someone else's Lana Del Rey footage.' 

Spell it out: Although the audience can be left in little doubt as to the nature of the attack on Miss Del Rey, subsequent scenes show characters staring grimly into the camera surrounded by balloons scrawled with the word 'Rape'

The film released by Sturmgruppe is a montage of disturbing scenes involving a dark dinner party populated with masked guests - Mr Manson, 45, among them - a man with a sniper slung over his shoulder, and a woman appearing to drown with blood pouring out from her mouth.

Miss Del Rey's attacker emerges half way through the footage, throwing her to the bed and slamming her face into the pillows.

As Miss Del Rey struggles to shake off him off, the man twists her arm round behind her back causing her to cry out, before pinning her down with his hand clamped over her open mouth, then forcing himself upon her.

As he stalks away, Miss Del Rey can be seen crumpled on the floor, her eyes streaming with tears.

Morbid: Other scenes show a dark figure wielding a sniper from the roof of a building

Although the audience can be left in little doubt as to exactly what has just happened, subsequent scenes show characters staring grimly into the camera surrounded by balloons scrawled with the word 'Rape.'  

Miss Del Rey's appearance in the short film may be shocking, but the New York-born crooner is no stranger to the macabre.

Speaking ahead of the release of her latest album, Ultraviolence, she stirred controversy when she claimed that dying young was 'glamorous' and stated: 'I wish I was dead already.' 

Incidentally, there were rumors of a fling between Miss Del Rey and Mr Manson, real name Brian Warner, in 2012, after they were allegedly spotted spending time together in a hotel in Berlin, Germany.

And speaking to Complex Magazine earlier this year, the two-time Grammy nominee let her fans in on the sort of relationships she was drawn to.

'I like a physical love. I like a hands-on love,' she said. 'How can I say this without getting into too much trouble? I like a tangible, passionate love.

'For me, if it isn’t physical, I’m not interested.'

Miss Del Rey - who co-incidentally made a cameo in the lyrics of an Eminem song last week in which the rapper threatens to 'punch her in the face' - is currently rumored to be engaged to musician Barrie-James O'Neill.

Mr Manson has been in and on-off relationship with photographer Lindsay Usich since 2010 and is set to release his next album next year.

And Mr Roth, a former flame of Peaches Geldof, who died of a heroin overdose in April at the age of 25, just tied the knot with model and actress Lorenza Izzo, 22.

The pair met on the set of the horror director's upcoming film, Knock Knock.
