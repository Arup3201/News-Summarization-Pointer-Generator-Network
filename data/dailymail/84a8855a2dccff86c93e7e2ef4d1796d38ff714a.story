A huge yellow diamond snatched in a £13million jewellery raid in London has resurfaced in a Hong Kong pawn shop.

Armed robbers took the 16-carat stone, valued at £1million, in an audacious heist on the Graff jewellers in Sloane Street in 2007.

Arriving in a £118,000 chauffeur-driven Bentley Continental, the two robbers – one wearing a panama hat and the other a beige suit – were allowed into the store by security staff.

Some of the diamonds stolen during the hold-up in London in 2007. It has now emerged that a 16-carat yellow diamond taken during the raid has appeared in a Hong Kong pawn shop

The raid was carried out by a pair of sharply dressed thieves who arrived in a $250,000 Bentley Continental Flying Spur

London store: 'Graff is and was the true owner of the diamond and entitled to immediate possession of the diamond,' but the pawn shop won't let the institute return the gem, the lawsuit says

They chatted briefly to the 
assistants before pulling out a pair of silver handguns and grabbing 
handfuls of rings, necklaces, earrings and diamonds.

The stockily-built men, aged between 40 and 55, then fled in the waiting Bentley.

The case has never been solved and the yellow diamond is understood to be the first item in the haul ever to be located.

The Hong Kong pawn shop claims it paid around £250,000 in 2010 for the stone, which had been recut after it was stolen.

They then sent it to the Gemological Institute of America in New York for appraisal.

However, institute staff had 
certified it before and recognised the diamond as one of the stolen 
Graff gems. The London jewellers are now suing for the diamond’s 
immediate return at Manhattan’s state supreme court in New York.

Graff says it is the diamond’s  ‘only rightful owner’, but claims the pawn shop will not let the institute return it to them.

Sam Hung, a director at the Yau On pawn shop in Hong Kong, said he was not aware the diamond was stolen when the shop bought it.

‘When I received the diamond, I had 
documentation about where I bought it but I had no method of knowing the
 source (of the diamond),’ he said.

‘But we did pay for it – we’re a pawn shop. We are now negotiating.’
Graff has suffered a string of high profile robberies in recent years.

In May 2003, a Serbian gang known as 
the Pink Panthers stole jewellery worth £23million from its flagship 
store in New Bond Street.

The branch was targeted again in 2009 when gems worth £40million were stolen in one of Britain’s biggest jewellery robberies.

Four men, who robbed the shop wearing suits and heavily disguised with make-up, were later jailed for up to 23 years.
