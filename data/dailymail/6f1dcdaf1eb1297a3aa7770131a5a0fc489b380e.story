Crawley striker Matt Harrold played in goal for the entire second half and won his first man-of-the-match award for the club as only a 96th-minute equaliser denied them the win over MK Dons.

The 30-year-old replaced goalkeeper Brian Jensen after he dislocated his finger in the 39th minute and, with no replacement on the substitutes' bench, Harrold was told to go between the sticks.

Harrold had never played in goal during a match or in training before, and admitted feeling a little awkward that his first man of the match came from stopping goals rather than scoring them.

Harrold earned his first man-of-the-match award by playing in goal for Crawley during the 2-2 draw

'I've never played in goal before. Not even in training,' Harrold told BBC Surrey after the 2-2 draw. 'I got pressured into it because everyone just looked at me and said "you're big". 

'It's a bit embarrassing because it's my first man of the match for the club. It was such a late goal to concede and we're all devastated but we would have taken a point when I went in goal.

'It was a bit like playing with 10 men because we dropped deep and they hung high balls up at me but I did enjoy it. I felt comfortable in there in the second half after having a bit of a shocker when I first came on.'

The draw means Crawley remain in the League One relegation zone but Crawley Town interim boss Dean Saunders was proud of Harrold's performance in goal.

'The fourth official put the board up with five minutes extra and played 96,' he said. 'Eventually there're so many people in the box that one of the balls has dropped to them and it feels like we've lost two points.

'We've got one goalkeeper at the club which I find unbelievable really but we have one keeper at the club and I was hoping we could get through this game and next week I can address it.

'Matt Harrold has gone in goal - hero. All the players have done well today and I can't pick any of them out.'
