They were voted the biggest fashion faux pas of last year, but three young designers want 'meggings' - that's male leggings - to become a wardrobe staple this season.

Luke Shipley, Joe Hollingworth and Tom Hunt have unveiled a range of meggings, called sTitch Leggings, which they hope will enable men to 'both look great and feel comfortable in leggings.'

So convinced are the trio by their brainchild, which came about after they were forced to wear 'ill-fitting female leggings' to a themed party, that they pitched it on Dragon's Den on Sunday.

Stylish? Meggings are the natural evolution from the skinny jean and the once widespread baggy jean, claim sTitch founders, (left to right) Joe Hollingworth, Tom Hunt and Luke Shiple, who are hoping to make the trousers into the next big fashion trend 

Priced at £25, sTitch leggings are inspired by celebrities like Russell Brand and Justin Bieber, who both favour meggings for casual daytime wear.

They come in an array of bright designs including rainbow-coloured diamonds and hot pink - and even come complete with back pockets for your valuables.

The founders claim that they are the natural evolution from the skinny jean and the once widespread baggy jean.

Writing on their website, the team say: 'We envision a day where men can wear what they want as opposed to what they should. 

'To achieve this, we will strive to design and produce garments that liberate the modern man from conventional male fashion.'

However, judging by their appearance before Duncan Bannatyne, Kelly Hoppen, Deborah Meaden, Piers Linney and Peter Jones, the world isn't quite ready for meggings.

The idea for meggings came about after the trio were forced to wear 'ill-fitting female leggings' to a party

Priced at £25, sTitch leggings are available in an array of fun designs and even come complete with a back pocket to store your valuables

Deborah Meaden retorted: ‘Seriously, it’s a bet, isn’t it?', while Peter Jones forced the men to swear the pitch wasn’t actually a joke.

Kelly Hoppen tweeted during the show saying: 'Is this a joke?' and 'I couldn't be more out if I tried'.

All of the Dragons decided against investing the £20,000 requested and Peter Jones concluded by saying meggings were 'one of the most ridiculous ideas in the Den we’ve ever seen’.

Speaking to MailOnline following their humiliating appearance on the show, the trio said: 'Six months, three auditions, weeks worth of preparation and rehearsing and we're finally stood in front of big Duncan staring us down, wearing leggings looking redder than the red carpet on Oscars night.'

Duncan Bannatyne, Kelly Hoppen, Deborah Meaden, Piers Linney and Peter Jones weren't impressed with the meggings, which one man tests out whilst practicing yoga 

'Duncan said that men don't wear leggings in his gym. You've obviously not graced the gym floor in the past two years big man,' retorted the founders of sTitch leggings, who shared this snap of a man wearing their brand whilst working out

Not ones to take the criticism lying down, they added: 'Debra was the worst. She was the most insulting.

'These guys are so out of touch with the real world that they didn't get the product. 

'Big Duncan's telling us that men don't wear leggings in his gym? You've obviously not graced the gym floor in the past two years, big man.'

Despite getting turned away by the Dragons, the team have seen a large rise in traffic and social media interaction, including receiving a tweet from the National Lottery.

Speaking about the future, they said: 'We will be expanding our range from nine designs by adding a further 12 and there is even talk of a completely new product before the year is out. 

'Taking this into account, we  are on track to double our 2014 sales figures. 

'With every new sale we add to our growing community of men in leggings around the world, this shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.'

The Twittersphere didn't seem to be convinced by the fashion brand
