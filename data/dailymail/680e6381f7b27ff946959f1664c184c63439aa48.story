Van driver Dale Barker trapped a dying heart attack victim in an ambulance

A furious van driver trapped a dying heart attack patient inside an ambulance after it clipped his wing mirror because he'd refused to move to let it through.

Dale Barker, 46, had pursued the emergency vehicle for more than a mile to Bradford Royal Infirmary and pulled up so close to the rear doors that paramedics could not open them to get the patient out.

He was also recorded on CCTV arguing with the crew.

Bradford Crown Court heard that the patient, a 42-year-old man, later died. Electrician Barker, of Bradford, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving last September.

Prosecutor Alisha Kaye told the court that the patient, who was not named in court, had suffered a heart attack and the ambulance crew had been taking him to BRI through heavy traffic.

The court heard that while Gemma Richardson was driving the vehicle her colleague was in the back performing CPR on the patient.

In the Great Horton area of the city the driver was confronted with queuing traffic, which included Barker's van.

'The sirens and flashing lights were activated and Gemma Richardson was carefully manoeuvring around the queuing traffic,' said Miss Kaye.

'All of the traffic moved apart from the defendant in his van. As the ambulance passed the defendant's van it clipped the wing mirror.'

Miss Kaye said minor damage was caused to the mirror, but as the ambulance continued the driver heard a horn blowing.

The ambulance driver realised Barker was following and described him being very close to the back of her vehicle.

Miss Kaye said the ambulance driver felt she had to keep a careful watch on Barker's van, which impeded her progress to the hospital.

The driver said she could see Barker's face and described him as being angry and making gestures towards her.

During the pursuit, which went on for 1.6 miles, Barker was also said to have followed the ambulance through a red light.

Miss Kaye said the patient was eventually taken out of the ambulance at the hospital but he subsequently died.

Barker had told police that the ambulance had taken his wing mirror off and he panicked and chased it. He described the incident as a silly mistake.

Miss Kaye said Barker told police he was very sorry and admitted having a problem with his temper. Barrister Yunus Valli, for Barker, said his client was a hard-working man who contributed positively to society and he acknowledged, with the benefit of hindsight, that he should not have done what he did.

Mr Valli submitted that it was a spur-of-the-moment offence which did not involve excessive speed and there had been no damage to other vehicles. He said his client had apologised for what he did to the officers who arrested and interviewed him.

The Honorary Recorder of Bradford, Judge James Stewart QC, told Barker that he had made a stupid mistake.

'I accept that what you did was a momentary lapse,' the judge told him. 'You reacted angrily to the ambulance having struck your wing mirror.'

Barker was made the subject of a 12-month community order, including a requirement to do 150 hours' unpaid work. He was also banned from driving for a year.
