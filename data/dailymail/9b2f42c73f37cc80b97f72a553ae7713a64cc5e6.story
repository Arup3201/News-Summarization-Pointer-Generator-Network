The horrifying moment a drunk driver slammed head-on into a car was caught on video. 

Sam Salas left a bar in DeKlab, Illinois and was so intoxicated that patrons of the bar tried to stop him, something he allegedly ignored.

And so one of those patrons, Ryan Taylor, decided to shoot cell phone video should anything happen as Salas, 43, and the woman he was with drove away. 

About 100 feet after he turned out of the parking lot, Salas slammed into another car.

When the person who filmed the incident ran down the street to help the victim, Salas told him; 'I'm drunk bro'

Taylor then leapt into action and was able to get the woman Salas hit, who was luckily fine, and the woman he was driving with out of their motor vehicles.

He also confronted Salas as he ran over, who told him; 'I'm drunk bro.' 

Salas also tried to apologize to his victim, asking if she was 'good.'

Salas failed a field sobriety test and has been charged with drunk driving

When asked by Inside Edition what his reaction was to the incident, Taylor said; 'I was blown away to be honest. As soon as he exited the parking lot, he looked very impaired. You could almost hear the tires squealing.'

Taylor then waited for police to arrive on the scene, who booked Salas and charged him with drunk driving after he failed a field sobriety test.
