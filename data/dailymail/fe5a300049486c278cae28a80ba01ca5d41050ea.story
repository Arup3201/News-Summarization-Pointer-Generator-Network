Stare down any of it’s quiet, sun-dappled avenues and you would have no idea you were in the richest town in America.

Apart from its location, Atherton, which only has 2,500 homes, is an unlikely spot for the super-rich. 

But now its secret is out and values have shot up by a further 40 per cent in the last six months alone

The area, nestled between San Francisco and San Jose, has always been affluent ever since it was the favoured location for the summerhouses of local industrialists and businessmen

The rise of Silicon Valley and the international super-rich, especially in China and India, have seen prices skyrocket in the last few years

Being named the most expensive Zip Code – 94027 – has sparked a frenzy among the Chinese and Indian buyers who want the cache of living in the town

In the first quarter of 2014 there were seven sales above $10m in the area

Ken DeLeon, of DeLeon Realty, has already sold $300m worth of property this year including a mansion for $14 million to a Chinese buyer in less than three days

Ken DeLeon's sales are so buoyant he has bought an aircraft to show perspective buyers an aerial view of the area and a Mercedes Limousine to whisk them around its oak-lined streets

It is flat and heavily wooded with oak, palm and redwood trees and its mansions are all hidden behind gates, hedges and walls.

There are no businesses allowed in the area but it has its own police force, town hall and library. 

There are two private schools and a private university within its limits.

But now its secret is out and values have shot up by a further 40 per cent in the last six months alone.

'To say it's on fire is an understatement,' said Eugene Korsunsky, a local realtor.

'It’s supernova hot. There are billionaire buyers from all over the world falling over themselves for a piece of Atherton.

'Mansions over the price of $10m are being paid for in cash in just a matter of days - often without being seen.'

'There is no doubt it is the best market in America even better than Manhattan,' he said. 'Being named the most expensive area in the U.S. has become self-fulfilling.

'Chinese buyers are so prestige driven and want to be able to say they live in the richest town in all America. 

Once they have bought a house they often knock it down to build a bigger one.'He said that he felt that the boom was based on solid foundations and not a bubble.

'I think it is built on real wealth,' he said. 'Not just speculation. I think we have several more years of growth left. It’s a real property boom and not just a bubble.'

He said that 40 percent of $5m houses were bought for cash, and 80 percent of $10m homes.

His company has just bought a $500,000 Cirrus GTS aircraft to show them the beauty of Atherton from above. 

DeLeon says that the market is getting competitive and he can spend as much $250,000 of his own money giving homes a facelift to beat off rivals and can spend as much as $10,000 on promotional videos for the properties that are being bought without a viewing.

DeLeon said that two years ago there was a frenzy of homes being bought at the $5m mark, but now it is more like $10m. He said that 80 percent of the buyers pay in cash.

Korsunsky, of Intempus Realty, said: 'We have high demand, low supply and lots of rich people who want to live here.' 

A previous resident Olive Holbrook-Palmer left her 22-acre estate to the town in 1958 which is now used as a park.

Its weather is good even by California standards. The neighbouring Redwood City boasts the slogan: 'Climate Best By Government Test'.

It is named after Faxon Atherton, a businessman and property speculator, who purchased a lot of the area in 1860 at a cost of $10 an acre.
