A couple who survived a Christmas Day aircraft crash in Burma that killed three people today recalled their dramatic escape as the carrier apologised for its worst accident since it started flying.

Air Bagan officials found the plane's two black boxes and are investigating what went wrong, but have so far blamed heavy fog for the crash into a rice paddy field where the plane burst into flames.

A British family survived the crash, but one of them was injured when the 21-year-old Fokker 100 jet, carrying 65 Christmas holidaymakers, smashed into the ground two miles short of its destination.

Three Burmese were killed in the 
tragedy - a tour guide and an 11-year-old child on board the plane, as 
well as a man riding a motorcycle on the road where it came down. Eleven
people were injured.

The plane crashed as it approached Heho airport in the east of Burma

The jet passed inspections at annual 
renewals of its air certificate. It was carrying 71 people from Yangon 
via Mandalay to Heho, which is the gateway to the popular tourist 
destination Inle Lake.

‘We felt the first bump, then a few 
big bumps and then (started) sliding very fast,’ said Australian 
advertising executive Anna Bartsch, 31. Her boyfriend Stuart Benson 
described it as a ‘rollercoaster’.

‘In my window I saw the flames, and it
was hot and we knew straight away we didn't have much time to get out,’
she said at a Yangon hotel where the airline put passengers after 
evacuating them.

Passengers rushed up the aisle to the 
front door, which was initially stuck shut, she said. ‘We didn't know 
then that the wings had come off,’ Ms Bartsch added.

The door was quickly forced open and 
passengers raced from the plane, some in shock and some suffering smoke 
inhalation, she said.

Once on safe ground, Ms Bartsch said she saw the pilot and co-pilot with bloodied faces and other people with serious burns.

‘It's amazing that the injuries were 
not more serious,’ she said. ‘It could have been much worse.’ The crew 
realised something was wrong only when the plane hit the ground.

‘We shouted, “This is an emergency”,’ 
said flight attendant Khaing Su Naing, adding that despite one of two 
doors initially getting stuck the crew evacuated the plane 90 seconds 
after it stopped moving.

The accident raised concerns about the
safety standards of Myanmar's overburdened airlines as foreign visitors
flock to the Southeast Asian country, emerging from a half-century of 
military rule.

Air Bagan, which started flying in 2004, is one of a half dozen private airlines that fly domestic routes in Myanmar.

After one plane was destroyed in 
Tuesday's crash its fleet now consists of five planes, including four 
ATR turboprops and another Fokker 100, which is no longer made.

‘We deeply apologise to all our 
passengers and to their family members,’ the airline's managing director
Htoo Thet Htwe told a news conference. All passengers were paid $2,300 
(£1,420), he said.

‘This is the most serious accident Air
Bagan has ever had,’ he said.

In 2008, one of its planes overshot a 
provincial airport's runway, spun out of control and crashed, causing 
the wings and tail to snap off. Many passengers were injured but none died.

Air Bagan has said ‘the plane hit electrical cables about a mile from Heho airport as it descended and landed in rice fields.’

The Information Ministry said the 
pilot mistook a road near the airport for a runway before stopping in a 
nearby rice paddy. It was unclear if the plane made its crash landing on
the road or the rice field.
