Murderer: Heather Emmonds, pictured, was found guilty of murdering her daughter-in-law Tina Casey

A grandmother who stabbed her daughter-in-law to death in a frenzied attack because she feared never seeing her grandson again has been found guilty of murder.

Heather Emmonds, 58, killed 42-year-old Tina Casey after being told she was moving to the Isle of Man and would never see her grandson again.

Newcastle Crown Court heard how in Frebruary this year she approached Miss Casey from behind as she lay on a sofa, then stabbed her 15 times in the neck and stomach with a filleting knife.

She then tried to burn her clothes and dispose of the weapon, but was found by police the next day with letters of confession after she crashed her car.

The jury heard how Emmonds, of Seaton Deleval, Northumberland, had tried to poison Miss Casey twice before by adding powdered sleeping pills to a chili and a sweet-and-sour meal she had made for her.

Miss Casey had been in an 'on/off' relationship with Emmonds's son Keith, and the jury heard how the two had clashed over access to the young boy, with Emmonds accused of being a 'bad grandmother'.

Emmonds could now face a minimum of 25 years in jail for her crime. She admitted killing Miss Casey in letters to police, but had denied murder on the grounds of loss of control and diminished responsibility.

In one of the letters found in Emmonds's crashed car, she wrote to her grandson in an attempt to justify killing his mother.

She said: 'Please don’t hate me for what I have done. I
really thought it was the best for you.

'I know it won’t look like it 
but dad is a great dad for you so be good for him and gramps. I will always love you.'

Victim: Miss Casey was stabbed 15 times in the neck and stomach as she lay on a sofa

The jury, of five women and seven men, deliberated for just two hours before finding her guilty of murder and having an offensive weapon.

She put her hand over her mouth and wept silently when the guilty verdict was returned at Newcastle Crown Court.

Judge Milford QC, sitting at Newcastle Crown Court, adjourned the sentence until tomorrow.

He told Emmonds: 'You have been 
convicted or murder and the only sentence I can impose is a sentence of 
life imprisonment, but I must decide what that minimum sentence will 
be.'

The trial heard how
Emmonds told detectives she had gone to Miss Casey’s home on February 3
and an argument erupted after she was told she couldn't take her 
grandson out for lunch.

Emmonds
said during a police interview: 'She said I am taking [him] back to the
Isle of Man, you are never going to see him again and I don’t care. 
He’s going back to my family, you won’t see him again.'

She how she saw a knife on a nearby table. She went on to describe the murder, saying 'I grabbed it and I stabbed her and I fought with her and I stabbed her several times.'

Emmonds, who called Miss Casey an 'evil and scheming woman', said she felt 'numb' after the killing.

Scene: Miss Casey's body was discovered with multiple stab wounds on her sofa in Holywell in Whitley Bay, North Tyneside

She considered setting Miss Casey's home on fire, with her body inside, to mask her actions, but said she had been put off by watching crime dramas, saying she had 'seen too many CSIs to know it doesn’t really work'.

The court heard how Emmonds had taken a change of clothing with her to Tina’s house and had attempted to burn her blood-stained clothes and the murder weapon with lighter fuel at a nearby stables.

Prosecutors said Emmonds carried out the killing so her young grandson would not be moved to the Isle of Man, while her defence lawyers said the killing was not premeditated, that she had lost her self control and suffered from a depressive illness.

In the days before the killing Miss Casey had told police she feared she was being poisoned by her mother-in-law.

Trial: Defendant Heather Emmonds had denied murder on grounds of diminished responsibility, but was found guilty of the crime by a jury

The judge said: 'On Saturday 2nd February Tina rang NHS direct and claimed that she had been poisoned - and so she had. The defendant had taken her a meal laced with sleeping tablets.

'The defendant does not dispute what she did. She said she didn’t want to kill Tina just to make her ill so Tina wouldn’t shout at her.”

During the trial Emmonds told Newcastle Crown Court: 'I don’t know what the trigger was to pick up the knife. I won’t know until I die, I have no idea.'

While in a letter addressed to police, she said: 'I didn’t intend to kill Tina Casey, it was a moment of madness and impulse.

'The knife and my clothes are in the boot of my car. The knife was mine but I lent it to Tina Casey. There was no preconceived plan. It just happened. I went onto auto-pilot, not eating or sleeping, I have never harmed anyone in my life.

'I am ashamed of my actions.'

After the case the victim’s family said in a statement: 'We’re really going to continue to miss Tina, especially her children and the rest of the family, both now and in the future.

'No one has won in this case, both sides of the family have lost a mother, one has died and another is in jail, through tragic circumstances.

'Both sides in this case have shown great dignity and have conducted themselves impeccably throughout this trial.

'We’d like to thank the police for their support and Victim Support who have both helped the family through this very difficult time.

'We hope everyone now can start to get on with their lives and put this behind us.”

Outside court, Detective Superintendent Steve Wade said: 'This crime has had a devastating effect on the family of Tina Casey and I’d like to thank them for their support and courage throughout this investigation.

'This was a horrific attack which resulted in the death of a mother and has left her family bereft.

'We welcome the decision of the jury and hope that it brings some closure for the family to know Heather Emmonds will spend a substantial period behind bars.

'My thoughts are with them at this difficult time.'
