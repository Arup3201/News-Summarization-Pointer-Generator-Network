The girlfriend who has stood by Ched Evans yesterday insisted he was innocent of rape – and pledged to support his bid to resume his football career when he is released from prison.

Natasha Massey spoke out after Judy Finnigan sparked a storm of outrage by saying his attack on a 19-year-old woman was ‘not violent’ and pointing out the victim had ‘had far too much to drink’.

Millionaire’s daughter Miss Massey insisted the only thing Evans had done wrong was to cheat on her, saying she had never doubted that he was innocent of rape despite the victim telling police she had no memory of having sex with him.

Just days before the former Sheffield United striker is due to be released, his sister Kylie and Miss Massey appeared on This Morning.

Ched Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey has insisted she will stand by her footballer boyfriend once he is released from prison this week

Miss Massey’s father Karl, who owns several companies including a jewellers in Wilmslow, Cheshire, has bankrolled a high-profile campaign proclaiming Evans’ innocence including a website and newspaper adverts.

He has also hired former detective Russ Whitfield, who runs a private investigations firm, and a legal team including specialist appeals barrister David Emanuel who have handed new evidence to the Criminal Cases Review Commission hoping it will re-examine Evans’ conviction.

Interviewed on the ITV programme by Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden – accompanied by the caption ‘I’m standing by my rapist boyfriend’ – Miss Massey, 25, said she had visited him every week since he was jailed in 2012.

The beauty therapist – who had been going out with the £20,000-a-week star for two years before the attack – said it had been ‘heartbreaking’ to learn he had cheated on her but that she had never doubted he was innocent of rape.

‘As soon as I found out that he’d been questioned over rape, my instinct was kind of protective of Ched, and I thought I have to stand by him,’ she said.

‘So my thoughts and feelings over the cheating were put to one side and I just stepped in to help him through this terrible time.

‘I know Ched and I knew he wouldn’t be capable of committing a crime like that.’

Miss Massey admitted the only day of his trial that she had attended was when the jury returned their verdicts, but insisted that ‘I knew the facts way before the jury, way before the public’.

After the shock of seeing him jailed, she told the programme she had no doubts about standing by him. ‘It was difficult at first. I never dreamed that Ched would be sent to prison,’ she said. ‘But straight away I got a message to him to say that I was standing by him and that everything will be OK … at first it was difficult, but then you adapt.’

Earlier this year she gave a newspaper interview telling of her intention to marry Evans after his release, and yesterday she said that while she did not know what the future held, she knows he hopes to play professional football again.

‘It’s out of our hands,’ she said. ‘We don’t know about Ched’s football – I’m just his partner, I don’t get involved in the football side – but I do know that Ched would love to return to football and continue doing what he knows best and what he loves.’

The case has become headline news once again after presenter Judy Finnigan sparked fury by suggesting Evans should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was ‘drunk’ and the rape was ‘unpleasant’ but ‘not violent’

She also claimed that many people who had signed the petition calling for him to be barred from football had subsequently contacted her saying they had changed their minds after reading about the case on the campaign website.

Also on the show, Evans’ sister recalled the ‘shocking’ moment the jury found him guilty, saying: ‘I was in court every day and I have no idea how they came to that conclusion.’ She added that ‘just because 12 people found him guilty, people should not necessarily listen to them’.

Later Miss Massey declined to comment to the Daily Mail about Miss Finnigan’s remarks, saying: ‘I don’t see what purpose it would serve.’
