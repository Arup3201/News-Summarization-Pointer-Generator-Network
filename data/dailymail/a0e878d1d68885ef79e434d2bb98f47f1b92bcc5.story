Doctors in France will be allowed to keep terminally ill patients sedated until death comes under new plans (file picture)

Terminally ill patients could be sedated until they die under plans in France to end suffering in the last stages of their life.

The laws would give people the 'right to deep, continuous sedation until death' at patients' request - and only when their condition is life-threatening in the short term.

The French parliament will debate a draft law on the highly sensitive issue from January, President Francois Hollande has revealed. 

Although euthanasia is not permitted in France, laws were passed in 2005 that allows for 'passive euthanasia', where a person causes death by withdrawing or withholding treatment. 

Outlining how the new laws would go a step further, Hollande said current legislation was too focused on the doctor's analysis and did not consider the patient's wishes.

But he stopped short of recommending lethal injections and avoided the terms euthanasia and assisted suicide.

'These proposals are centred on the patients whose suffering should be avoided. It respects their choice and wishes,' Hollande said. 

Apart from Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, few countries in the world explicitly permit euthanasia or assisted suicide. 

The issue is contentious in France where debate has raged over whether terminally ill patients suffering in the last stages of their life should be allowed to die. 

Hollande promised before his 2012 election to introduce new
right-to-die legislation in France, which left grey areas in a
2005 law on patient rights and care for the terminally ill.

The  Leonetti law currently limits 'therapeutic
obstinacy', or treatments that only prolong the life of a
terminally ill patient without providing a cure.

Hollande said the new proposals would mean that if a patient's life was immediately in danger and the treatment was not working or causing more suffering then they could be sedated. 

If a patient was unable to decide alone, then the doctor - with consultation - would have an obligation to end
treatment because it would only be keeping the patient
artificially alive, Hollande said.

He added that if a person had indicated either before
falling seriously ill or during their sickness how they wished
to die then doctors should take account of those instructions.

'Advance directives in which everyone can stipulate refusal
of aggressive treatment for serious illness would be "binding" under these proposals,' Hollande said.

Opinion polls show broad support for legalised euthanasia in
late terminal cases. Hospital staff convicted of helping
patients die in recent years have often been given suspended
sentences in view of this approach.

The issue gained prominence after an elderly couple took their own lives in a luxury Paris hotel in 2013 leaving a note
explaining that they had wanted to die with dignity.

'These proposals are balanced and realistic. They aim to
stop the suffering of those close to the end of their lives,
respect their wishes and allows the right to die in dignity,'
Hollande said.
