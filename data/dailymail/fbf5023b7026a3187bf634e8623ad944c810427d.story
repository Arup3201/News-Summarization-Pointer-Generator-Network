A middle-aged man collapsed and died outside a Cleveland courtroom minutes after a judge sentenced him to jail time for trying to restrain and kiss a 14-year-old girl.

The coroner's office was expected to determine why 51-year-old Miguel Aybar suddenly passed away Wednesday morning.

Aybar was in handcuffs when he slumped to the floor in the hallway outside the courtroom in the Cleveland Municipal Court.

Final moments: Courtroom video shows Miguel Aybar, 51, pictured at the stand, being sentenced to 60 days in jail for kissing a 14-year-old girl on the mouth

Justice: Aybar said through an interpreter that his underage love interest had feelings for him, but Judge Michelle Early would hear none of it

Judge Michelle Earley sentenced Aybar to 60 days in jail after he was found guilty of a third-degree misdemeanor charge of unlawful restraint.

Cleveland Municipal Judge Michelle Early was outraged to hear the suspect's claim that the 14-year-old he kissed had feelings for him

He was accused of restraining the 14-year-old girl and trying to kiss her on the mouth 'with his tongue.'

In courtroom video of Aybar's sentencing obtained by 19 Action News, the man takes the stand and tells the judge through a interpreter that he thought the girl had feelings for him.

'She’s 14 years old!' Judge Early cries out in response. 

The footage then shows Aybar being led out of the courtroom toward the Cleveland City Jail flanked by two court officers. Minutes later, the man was dead.

The victim's mother has since spoken out about the incident, saying the situation is very awkward for the family since Aybar was her neighbor and also the stepfather of her boyfriend.

The woman, who has not been named, 
said she was conflicted: on the one hand, justice has been served for 
her daughter, but on the other she feel sorry for the Aybar's family.

According
 to the mom, her 14-tyear-old never intended for anything like this to 
happen to Aybar, adding that the man had been suffering from high blood 
pressure.
