Craig Shirley, 42, was the first person in the UK to receive an abdominal wall transplant, and has told how the operation transformed his life

Two patients who received the first abdominal wall transplants in the UK are enjoying the simple things in life, after the groundbreaking operation transformed their lives.

Craig Shirley, 42, was the first person in the UK to receive the transplant while Amy Grime, 28, was the first woman to undergo the procedure.

Before their operations, both had to be fed intravenously for several years and found themselves mostly housebound.

But now their lives have been turned around and they can eat and drink normally as well as take up much-loved hobbies.

Mr Shirley, from Royal Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire, received a combined abdominal wall and bowel wall transplant at the Churchill Hospital as part of the intestinal transplant programme at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust.

He fell ill in January 2011 while at the gym, suffering numbness down his left side and blurred vision.

Fearing he may have had a stroke, he visited his GP but hospital tests were inconclusive.

The day after being discharged, Mr Shirley began to suffer terrible abdominal pain and phoned 999.

He was admitted to hospital, where doctors removed the vast majority of his small intestine after discovering a clot.

Mr Shirley was in intensive care for two weeks and then spent a further six weeks in a high dependency unit.

He was then transferred to the specialised intestinal unit at Salford Royal Hospital.

The fitness fanatic was put on a transplant waiting list, receiving his operation in June last year.

He said: 'Before my transplant, I could not eat or drink and needed to be fed intravenously for 14 hours a day.

'Although I could have tastes of food and drink, I did not benefit nutritionally from them at all.

'Now I have a completely normal diet. After 18 months of not being allowed to eat, I confess I ate a lot of chocolate, sweets and cakes. Now, I'm cutting down those treats and achieving a more balanced diet.

'I'm also working on building up my energy. I used to do a lot of fitness activities and go to the gym and I'm working my way up to being able to do more.

'Having the transplant has been amazing, it's changed my life completely.

'I was originally told I would never eat again, never get up to go to the gym again. What happened to me was so out of the blue because I was very fit. My family were told to expect the worst but I've managed to come through.'

Ms Grime, 28, suffered severe Crohn's disease from an early age and spent much of her childhood and teenage years in hospital where she underwent bowel resection surgery.

After contracting septicaemia and MRSA, she developed multiple abnormal growths across her abdominal wall and was left with only 60 to 90cm of her small bowel.

Ms Grime was also losing up to four litres of liquid a day through her abdominal wall, which was scarred and damaged following years of surgery.

After being put on the transplant waiting list, Ms Grime had a bowel and abdominal wall transplant at the Churchill Hospital in January this year.

She said: 'I was fed intravenously on and off for about eight or nine years.

'In the last year before my transplant, I was fed this way for 12 hours every night.

'I was permanently dehydrated and pretty housebound.

'The operation has changed my life. Although I do experience some problems, I wouldn't go back. I can now go out for meals, I can eat, drink and socialise. I do normal day-to-day things that I couldn't do before - it was a nightmare.

'This time a year ago, I was struggling to do the most simple of tasks and everyday was spent hooked up to a machine. I have regained my quality of life. I am back on my horse, socialising with my friends and I am really enjoying being able to eat as normal.'

Ms Grime is currently off work from her job as a theatre clerk at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford but is hoping to go back soon.

Since June 2012, a total of 10 patients have undergone abdominal wall transplant surgery at the Churchill Hospital.

Every year, around 25 to 30 people require small bowel transplant operations. Half of these patients may also need an abdominal wall transplant because their own abdominal wall muscle has suffered due to injury or multiple operations.

Consultant surgeon Henk Giele, who is a member of the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (Bapras), led the team who carried out the operations.

He said: 'An intestinal transplant is both life-saving and life-creating.

It helps to solve extremely difficult living conditions for patients, many of whom have spent years unable to eat solid food leaving them completely reliant on intravenous feeding for up to 18 hours a day.

'For these people, being able to eat and taste again is a revelation, so this is truly transformative surgery.

'Whilst our progress over the past year is hugely exciting, we want to raise awareness that this type of surgery is now possible, as we are reliant on the generosity of donors for transplant procedures to go ahead.

'The success of these first operations has been made possible through close collaboration between all transplant surgeons, anaesthetic staff, donor co-ordinators, as well as the NHS Blood and Transplant.'
