Elizabeth Thomas, 17, was murdered by her boyfriend in Oxted, Surrey

A teenage boy admitted stabbing his 17-year-old girlfriend to death at his home when he appeared before a judge today.

Steven Miles pleaded guilty to the murder of Elizabeth Thomas and will be sentenced next month.

Miss Thomas's body was discovered at the Miles's family's flat in Oxted, Surrey, shortly before 5pm on Friday January 24.

A post-mortem examination revealed that she had died from a stab wound. Miles, aged 17, was arrested on suspicion of murder and detained under the Mental Health Act the same day.

At the time of her death, friends claimed that Miss Thomas had wanted to end her relationship with Miles, then 16. She had just recently joined Oxted School sixth form, where Miles also studied, and lived in West Wickham.

At Guildford Crown Court today, Judge Christopher Critchlow lifted reporting restrictions, allowing Miles to be named.

Lewis Power, representing the ginger-haired Miles, described the case as 'very difficult, complex and unique' and said yesterday would have been Miss Thomas's birthday.

He said numerous reports had described Miles as suffering from conditions including mixed personality disorder and Asperger's syndrome.

Members of both Miles and Miss Thomas's families showed no emotion as they sat in the public gallery of the court as Miles admitted murder.

Miles's parents, Emma and David, who moved to Oxted from Edenbridge in Kent five years ago, are thought to run a gardening business.

Judge Critchlow said a total of seven experts including psychologists at Feltham YOI where Miles is in custody, had provided reports to him.

He ordered a report by Youth Services to be compiled on Miles and submitted to the court before sentencing.

Addressing Miles, Judge Critchlow said: ' You have pleaded guilty to the gravest crime and you are only 17 years of age.

'In due course here, you will be given credit for the fact you have owned up to what you did. In the meantime and before sentencing, there will be further reports put before this court from the Youth Service and you will have an opportunity to talk to them.

'You are remanded in custody until October 2.'
