It is a world away from economy class. Sales of private planes are soaring in Britain, even as millions of families have had to tighten their belts.

Demand has gone up by almost 50 per cent in the years following the credit crunch, with the UK taking delivery of 232 new aircraft between 2007 and 2011, the most for any European country.

The boom is fuelled by executives who want to minimise journey times and  Russian oligarchs with cash to burn.

Britain now has Europe’s second largest fleet of business planes, at 503, with 369 jets and 134 turboprops.

Only Germany has more, with 621 
according to research by Beechcraft Corporation, maker of the King Air 
turboprop plane, based on data from NetJets, a  Warren Buffett-backed 
aviation firm.

Sports stars have contributed to the 
effect, with Andy Murray recently hiring a plane from NetJets to fly 
between Madrid and Rome.

From 2007 to 2011, deliveries of new 
planes to Britain soared by 47 per cent compared to the so-called ‘boom 
years’ of 2002 to 2006.

Shawn Vick, president of Beechcraft 
International Services Company, said demand was driven by London’s 
position as a financial hub and the country’s ‘culture of savvy 
entrepreneurial people’, adding: ‘These aircraft give them rapid access 
to new markets.’

He said that Europe ‘remains a big market for business aviation and it continues to grow’.

The use of private planes by board 
members at publicly listed companies has riled small investors, but Mr 
Vick said it was wrong to see them as a perk.

Growth fluctuations: Beechcraft said that 232 aircraft were delivered to customers in Britain between 2007 and 2011 - up 47 per cent on the so-called boom years of 2002 to 2006

He said: ‘Shareholders should not be complaining as you can be far more productive.

‘I’ve tried visiting four countries in Europe over two days on scheduled
aircraft. One delay and it becomes impossible. With a business 
aircraft, I can do it in one day.’

NetJets, which offers rental or part-ownership, said demand for shares in its planes is growing.

Top models include the Gulfstream 
G550, Dassault Falcon, Hawker 400 and Cessna Citation XLS – the world’s 
best-selling  business jet.

Marine Eugene, European sales 
director of NetJets, said: ‘A lot of these aircraft will be 
replacements, with deliveries the result of orders from 2005, 2006 and 
2007.

‘Also, a lot of the aircraft 
delivered to the UK and registered there won’t be flying in the UK, 
they’ll be flying in Russia – a market that has taken off in recent 
years with the increasing number of billionaires.’

Britain’s busiest airport for private
planes last year was Luton, famously linked to cockney actress Lorraine
Chase. It handled 12,371 flights, about half as many as leader 
Paris-Le-Bourget, with 24,412.

Geneva was second with 17,824 flights and Nice third at 14,091.

Chartering a private plane such as a 
Cessna Citation for an overnight return for five people between  London 
City Airport and Frankfurt in Germany would cost approximately £10,000.

Return flights from London to Paris could cost from £4,700 to £27,000 depending on the plane.

A less conspicuous way to fly privately is ‘jet cards’, where clients buy a 25-hour block of flight time.
