Close encounter: Prince Andrew with 17-year-old Virginia Roberts in 2001

Soon the murky affair of Prince Andrew and Virginia Roberts will face scrutiny via a series of sensational cases due to come before the U.S. courts. But as the scandal escalates, here are ten questions the Royal Household must address…

1 You have denied that Prince Andrew had ‘any kind of sexual relationship or contact with Virginia Roberts’. He certainly did meet her, however: a photograph was taken late one night in early 2001 of the pair together at a London apartment owned by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the shamed late newspaper boss Robert Maxwell.

The picture shows the Duke of York’s left hand cradling Ms Roberts’s bare midriff. At the time, she was 17; he, on the other hand, was a 40-year-old father of two. So how did this image come to be taken?

2 Ms Roberts claims to have first met Prince Andrew at Ms Maxwell’s property the previous afternoon. During this initial encounter (over tea and biscuits), Roberts says the Prince was asked to guess her age. Andrew correctly estimated that she was 17, prompting Ms Maxwell to reportedly joke that Jeffrey Epstein ‘would soon have to trade her in’. Did the Prince indeed meet her that day?

3 According to Ms Roberts — in a legal claim filed in Florida last month — she and Prince Andrew had sexual contact in the hours after they returned from the Mayfair nightclub Tramp.

This, you have vehemently denied. Ms Roberts claims, however, that this alleged tryst was far from being a one-off: she says that she met the Prince on a second occasion at Epstein’s apartment in New York at Easter 2001.

When she arrived that day, she alleges that the Duke of York was seated in a leather armchair in the library, with a girl called Johanna Sjoberg on his knee.

So did Prince Andrew meet Ms Roberts at Epstein’s apartment at Easter 2001? And, furthermore, has he ever met Miss Sjoberg?

4 The lawsuit, filed last month at Florida District Court in West Palm Beach, alleges that a third sexual encounter took place shortly afterwards in 2001, on Epstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Ms Roberts claims that she and ‘seven Russian girls’ were ‘told to assemble in a big cabana’ on the island, where Prince Andrew and Epstein were sitting in armchairs.

You have described her claims as ‘false and without foundation’. But did the Prince ever visit Epstein’s private island? If so, why? And did he ever meet Ms Roberts there?

5 Jeffrey Epstein’s former handyman Juan Alessi alleges that Prince Andrew attended naked swimming pool parties at the billionaire’s Florida mansion in the early 2000s and was treated to regular massages by a harem of adolescent girls there.

In sworn legal papers filed in 2011, Alessi described the house as being full of pictures of naked young women, and said that the Prince stayed in a blue guest room which contained soap in the shape of male and female genitalia.

He also claimed to have set up massage tables on which the royal guest was treated on a daily basis.

You have, of course, robustly denied wrongdoing. But did the Prince indeed ever stay at Epstein’s Florida home? If so, why? Did he share its swimming pool with naked young women? Did he ever receive massages from young women there?

6 Prince Andrew appears to have regarded Epstein as a close friend. The American was invited to visit Sandringham, Balmoral and Windsor Castle as a guest of the Queen. In turn, the Prince was invited, and agreed to go, on holiday to Thailand with him, where he was photographed on Epstein’s yacht surrounded by topless women.

Despite the scrutiny it attracted, the Palace has never explained the exact nature of Prince Andrew’s relationship with Epstein.

Were they purely social acquaintances? Or did they ever have wider business or financial links? Did the Prince have any idea of Epstein’s criminal behaviour?

Ms Ferguson admitted that accepting money from Epstein had been ‘a gigantic error of judgment’

7 In 2005, police began investigating Epstein’s abuse of young girls. The following year, they filed an affidavit saying that he should be charged with four counts of unlawful sex with a minor and one of molestation. In the meantime, dozens of alleged victims came forward. The case was settled in 2008, when Epstein struck a deal with prosecutors: he agreed to plead guilty to a single charge of soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he would be jailed for 18 months.

In return, all other inquiries were dropped and immunity granted to a number of Epstein’s alleged associates, including Ms Maxwell.

That deal remains highly controversial, with many feeling that Epstein got off excessively lightly.

A lawsuit filed in Florida last month now claims that Prince Andrew was among those who made ‘efforts’ on behalf of Epstein ‘to persuade the [U.S.] government to give him a more favourable plea arrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement’.

In response, you have said that ‘the Duke would never interfere in an active legal case and did not do so in this case’.

But while he may not have ‘interfered’, did he discuss Epstein, formally or informally, with any person connected with the U.S. government, or U.S. authorities, during the period from 2005-2008 when his friend was under investigation?

8 Prince Andrew visited New York and Washington in September 2006, and Florida in February 2008. Did he discuss Epstein’s case with anyone at all during any of those visits? And did he meet Epstein, or anyone connected with him, during those trips?

Official records show that Andrew also met with Sir David Manning, the then UK ambassador to Washington, in September 2006, and also with the then Foreign Office minister Kim Howells in July 2005.

Was Jeffrey Epstein’s case discussed at any of those meetings? And did the Prince raise his case, formally or informally, with any person connected to the British government?

9 In 2010, after Epstein had been imprisoned for soliciting girls for underage prostitution, the Duke of York’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, agreed to accept a gift of £15,000 from him, in order to help clear her debts.

After this was revealed by the Press in 2011, Ms Ferguson admitted that accepting the money had been ‘a gigantic error of judgment’.

Was Prince Andrew aware of this gift? Did he help solicit it? And has the tainted money since been returned to Epstein?

10 Finally, in 2011, after Jeffrey Epstein had been freed from prison, the News of the World published a photograph of him strolling with Prince Andrew in New York’s Central Park.

The image caused widespread outrage, and led to the Prince’s resignation as Britain’s roving Trade Ambassador.

Why did the Prince choose to continue his personal relationship with Epstein — by then a convicted paedophile — at this time? How many meetings did he have with Epstein following his conviction? And when did he last speak to or meet him?
