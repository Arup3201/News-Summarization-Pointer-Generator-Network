These are the thrill seekers risking their lives on Britain’s coasts to capture 'weather bomb selfies'.

Among them was Stuart Kinnear, who posed at Portstewart in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, as the country was hit by swells of up to 60ft and winds of 80mph.

And a woman was pictured photographing herself in front of huge waves on the Lancashire coast at Blackpool yesterday - before looking rather sheepish when she became soaked.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has issued guidance urging people to stay away from huge waves which ‘could be carrying rocks or other debris that has been churned up along the way’.

Weather warnings were in place for much of the UK today but the mainland has so far survived relatively unscathed by the Atlantic ‘weather bomb’ - formally known as an ‘explosive cyclogenesis’.

The Met Office has severe weather warnings out for wind in the North and Scotland today, and in the South tomorrow. Tomorrow, there is an ice and snow warning for the North and Scotland.

An MCA spokesman told MailOnline today: 'In some parts of the country, conditions on the sea and along the coast are extremely treacherous with gale-force winds, large waves and heavy rain.

'Don't take risks': The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has issued guidance urging people to stay away from huge waves which ‘could be carrying rocks or other debris that has been churned up along the way’.

'The Coastguard's advice is simple: don't take risks. The crashing waves may be spectacular to watch but they are also extremely dangerous. 

'They could quite easily sweep you off your feet, and they could be carrying rocks or other debris that has been churned up along the way. If you are taking photos of the sea, take care, a great photo is not worth risking your life for. 

'If you do get into difficulty, or spot someone who might be in trouble, call 999 and ask for the Coastguard.' 

Selfies also came under fire earlier this year when Team Sky rider Geraint Thomas warned British crowds taking the photographs were endangering the safety of riders at the Tour de France.
