At least 18 people were killed yesterday in a car suicide bombing at the United Nations office in the Nigerian capital Abuja.

A car laden with explosives rammed through two gates before slamming into the concrete building as it teemed with hundreds of staff.

No group claimed immediate responsibility, although Africa’s most populous nation faces a growing threat of homegrown terrorism.

The bomb has killed at least 16 people, according to the Nigerian Red Cross

The suspected suicide attack managed to topple one wing of the building

Militants from a radical Muslim sect have previously carried out attacks in the capital, though never on a foreign target.

Unrest in the country’s oil-rich Niger Delta in the south has also spawned a violent militant group.

Witnesses described a saloon car ramming through gates at the UN compound as guards tried to stop it hitting the main building.

The suicide bomber crashed the car into a reception area and detonated the explosives, inflictingthe most damage possible, a spokesman for the Nigerian National Emergency Management Agency said.

'I saw scattered bodies,' said Michael Ofilaje, a UNICEF worker at the building. 'Many people are dead.'

He said it felt like 'the blast came from the basement and shook the building'.

The building houses about 400 employees of the UN in Nigeria, including the majority of its offices. A local UN spokesman declined to comment.

Alessandra Vellucci, a spokeswoman for the UN office in Geneva, said the global body's offices in Abuja had been bombed.

UN officials said the the attack was a suspected bombing

The building, in the same neighbourhood as the U.S. embassy and other diplomatic posts in Abuja, had a huge hole punched in it.

Local police spokesman Jimoh Moshood confirmed the blast, but said police were still investigating the cause.

Reuben Abati, a spokesman for President Goodluck Jonathan, said the presidency would later issue a statement on the attack.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, but oil-rich Nigeria faces terrorism threats on multiple fronts.

Last year, a militant group from the country's crude-producing Niger Delta blew up car bombs in the capital during Nigeria's 50th independence anniversary ceremony, killing at least 12.

Nigeria, a nation of 150 million, is split between a largely Christian south and Muslim north. In recent months, the country has faced an increasing threat from a radical Muslim sect called Boko Haram, which wants to implement a strict version of Shariah law in the nation.

The sect has carried out assassinations and bombings, including the June car bombing of the national headquarters of Nigeria's federal police that killed at least two people.

Earlier this month, the commander for U.S. military operations in Africa said Boko Haram may be trying to link with two al Qaeda-linked groups in other African countries to mount joint attacks in Nigeria.

During a visit to Nigeria earlier this month General Carter Ham said that 'multiple sources' indicate Boko Haram made contacts with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which operates in northwest Africa, and with al-Shabab in Somalia.

'I think it would be the most dangerous thing to happen not only to the Africans, but to us as well,' Mr Carter said.

Boko Haram - which in the Hausa language 
spoken in northern Nigeria means 'Western education is sinful' - is 
loosely modelled on the Taliban movement in Afghanistan. 

Boko Haram became active in around 2003 and is concentrated mainly in the northern Nigerian states of Yobe, Kano, Bauchi, Borno and Kaduna. 

The group considers all who do not follow its strict ideology as infidels, whether they are Christian or Muslim.

It demands the adoption of Islamic law, sharia, in all of Nigeria.  

Boko Haram followers have prayed in separate mosques in cities including Maiduguri, Kano and Sokoto, and wear long beards and red or black headscarves.    

In early July 2010, Abubakar Shekau, a 
former deputy leader of the sect who was thought to have been killed by 
police in 2009, appeared in a video and claimed leadership of the group.

He said he was ready to launch attacks on western influences in 
Nigeria.

Rights groups say more than 250 people have been killed by Boko Haram since July 2010. 

In July 2009, Boko Haram staged attacks in the northeastern city of Bauchi after the arrest of some of its members, and clashed with police and the army in the northern city of Maiduguri.

Some 800 people were killed in five days of fighting in the two cities.   

In December 2010 the group said it was behind bombings in central Nigeria and attacks on churches in the northeast that led to the deaths of at least 86 people.          

In June 2011, Boko Haram claimed responsibility when a suicide bomber detonated a bomb that tore through a car park outside Nigeria's police headquarters in Abuja. It was Nigeria's first suicide bomb, said police.

On June 26 around 25 people were killed when several bombs exploded in the Dala ward of Maiduguri after suspected Boko Haram members threw bombs at a drinking spot.                   

On August 25 Boko Haram members attacked Gombi police station in the northeast, killing four policemen and one soldier before driving to the First Bank and Union Bank where they killed seven staff and carried off an unspecified amount of money.
