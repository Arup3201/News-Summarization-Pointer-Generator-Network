A Canadian parliament member had the chamber in tears after he admitted to leaving his seat during a vote because of a pair of ill-fitting underpants he had recently bought on sale.

Pat Martin, a representative for Winnipeg, told the House of Commons he had trouble sitting for a long period of time because he 'bought a bunch that was clearly too small for me'.

'I realize I did inadvertently leave my seat briefly in the middle of the debate, but I can blame it on a sale that they had down at the Hudson's Bay,' Martin said. 'They had men's underwear that was on for half-price.' 

Canadian parliament member Pat Martin, from Winnipeg, admitted to leaving his seat during a vote on Friday because a pair of ill-fitting pants he had bought on sale were too small and made it uncomfortable to sit

Martin violated formal procedure by stepping away from his chair and then returning to cast his vote on whether to adjourn debate on an anti-terrorism bill, according to the National Post. 

His absence was brought to Deputy Speaker Joe Comartin's attention by member Royal Galipeau, who asked if Martin's vote was still valid because he had breached protocol. 

Caught in the act, Martin confessed to his too-tight underwear. 

'I apologize if it was necessary for me to leave my seat briefly, but I did not mean to forfeit my right to vote,' he said.  

After the chamber erupted into laughter, even Comartin had to get it on the fun.

Martin bought the half-price briefs from department store Hudson's Bay, which capitalized on the publicity to make sure people knew the 50 per cent off sale was still going strong 

Political columnist John Ivison offers Martin some advice. Martin had left his seat in the Chamber before returning to cast his vote on whether to adjourn a debate about an anti-government bill

 

Although it is technically against parliamentary rules to leave one's seat during a vote, House of Commons speaker Joe Comartin validated Martin's vote because he had been present when the motion was read 

'I had no briefing on this type of motion,' he said, before validating Martin's vote because he was present when the motion was read. 

Hudson's Bay, a Canadian department store, capitalized on the free press and tweeted out that their 'manties' 50 per cent off sale was still going strong. 

'Pants are overrated,' the tweet claimed. 

One Twitter user also tried to give Martin some advice. 

'Sympathize with Pat Martin and his underwear dilemma,' political columnist John Ivison wrote. 'As he's of solid Scottish stock, and a regular kilt wearer, the solution is obvious.'

Another user felt he had received a lesson in government.

'I think we all learned a little something about democracy today. And Pat Martin's shopping habits.'

One user even got artistic, photoshopping Martin's head to another famous Canadian's body. 

'I have a feeling I may have been a little generous with this photochop', the user said as he shared a picture of Martin's head on Justin Bieber's recent Calvin Klein briefs ad.  

Some Twitter users even got artistic, photoshopping Martin's face to the body of Justin Bieber, another famous Canadian, in his Calvin Klein brief ads.
