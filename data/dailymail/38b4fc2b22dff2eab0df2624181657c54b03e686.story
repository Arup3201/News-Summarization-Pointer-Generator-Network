Luis Pantoja, 25, was charged with the brutal rape of a 15-year-old girl

A man arrested last summer for sexual assault has been charged with the savage rape of a 15-year-old girl as she was on her way to school in Belmont Cragin, Chicago.

Luis Pantoja, 25, who goes by the name 'silent' was arrested Friday for the brutal attack on December 17 at the 2400 block of North Long Avenue. Police were able to match Pantoja's DNA to a condom wrapper found near where the girl was attacked at around 5:25 am.

Pantoja was arrested at his home at the 5500 block of West Wrightwood Avenue and is being charged with attempted first degree murder, aggravated criminal assault, aggravated battery, and unlawful use of a weapon by a felon. He was held without bail, reported the Chicago Tribune.

Pantoja aka 'Silent' is hearing impaired and therefore needed a sign language interpreter for the hearing.

Police seized an Arminius blue-steel,seven-shot handgun from Pantoja's home. However whether or not he had the gun during the attack is unclear, said Sally Daly, a spokesperson for the Cook's County state attorney's office.

The 15-year-old victim was discovered in a residents backyard at around 8 a.m. laying in a puddle of blood. She was shoeless and her pants had been forcibly removed.

The Chicago Sun Times reports that they initially thought the attack occurred at 6 a.m. but they later found out she was attacked 35 minutes earlier, leading officers to Pantoja as the perpetrator.

Pantoja has a criminal record dating back to 2005. He has charges for drugs, theft, and disorderly conduct . In August he was charged with criminal assault exactly three months to the day of the attack on December. 17. He was held on $200,000 bail but his case was later dismissed due to lack of probable cause.

The Chicago Sun Times reports that it was Pantoja's conviction in 2008 for failure to report an accident that may have been the key to his most recent arrest.

The 2008 crime in addition to his previous crimes led to a six year stay in prison that required him to hand over DNA to the federal database. The police were able to match his DNA from the scene of the crime to the DNA in their system.

The victim of Pantoja's brutal attack remains at Mount Sinai Hospital in critical condition. Last week she improved enough to be able to communicate with police officers.

'Everybody knows she was in really bad shape. She’s doing better. Her and her family are taking it day-by-day, but we can only keep her in our thoughts and hope she improves,' Area North Cmdr. Gary Yamashiroya told reporters Sunday afternoon, adding: 'But she is doing better.'

Pantoja lives just blocks from where the attack occurred.
