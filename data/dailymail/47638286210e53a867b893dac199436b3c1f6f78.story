A man who 'preyed' on women online and broke dozens of hearts across state lines is today facing charges of stealing from his conquests to fund his casanova lifestyle.

Ray Holycross, 29, who is also said to go by the names Ray Parris, Ray Cross and Ray Tompson, is accused of defrauding some of the 38 women he seduced after meeting them over the internet.

Police say he is suspected of plotting a journey across the US from the Midwest to Portland, Florida and Texas using dating websites to meet women he could move in with and steal from in.

He is accused of various offenses including withdrawing $1,000 from the bank of one ex and stealing electronic goods from iphones to laptops.

He is due to be arraigned today on one charge of theft, accused of stealing the camera of former partner Theresa Bridgegroom, of Mishawaka, Indiana.

Holycross is also wanted in Oregon on two counts stemming from an identity theft charge.

Police say many more women have come forward claiming he preyed on them through online dating sites and fooled them into believing he was in love before taking their belongings.

According to ABC there are 38 allegations in total.

'I think he relies on girls that he meets on the Internet to provide him with what he needs to get through life,' Lt. Michael Budreau of the Medford Police Department in Oregon said in August.

Bridegroom, 35, claims Holycross pawned her camera. She met him on dating site PlentyofFish.com and he moved into her home.

'I think he should pay for what he did,' she told the broadcaster.

She discovered his alleged 'secret life' through his mobile phone records.

'He had been texting over 25 to 30 different women. Meeting up with 7 to 8 women a day when he was supposedly at work,' she said.

Other victims have spoken of their heartbreak at the hands of the good-looking dater from Plymouth whose looks have been likened to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.

'He made me feel like he was going to take care of me and, instead, I was left with absolutely nothing,' Jennifer Clark told ABC.

'He was extremely charming and convincing and, looking back at myself, I feel foolish.'

She also claims Holycross stole from her. After going out for cigarettes one night he never came back

Another alleged victim Tahsha Hollister also met Holycross on PlentyofFish.

'The minute that he told me he needed a place to stay, I just had this instinct like he was looking for me to say to him, â€˜You can stay with me,' she told the broadcaster.

Indiana police said they couldn't comment on other cases but said investigations were 'active'

Mishawaka police Lt. Tim Williams told ABC: 'There are active cases that are being investigated right now. What they are we can't 
comment on since they are active ongoing.'
