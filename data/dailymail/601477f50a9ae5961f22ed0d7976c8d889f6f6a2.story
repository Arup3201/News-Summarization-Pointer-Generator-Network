A Cincinnati woman is suing her ex-boyfriend and staff at a hospital where she was being treated for a sexually transmitted disease after copies of her medical records were put online.

Details of the unidentified woman's records were allegedly posted on to the Facebook page 'Team No Hoes' in September last year.

The mother says she was bullied online, and that she received harassing phone calls at her home after being exposed on the social networking site.

Claims: UC Medical Center in Cincinnati is accused of failing to protect private medical records after a patient claimed details of her STI treatment were posted online

A nurse and staff member at UC Medical Center, and the woman's ex-boyfriend Raphael Bradley, are named in the suit which is seeking $25,000 in damages.

Her suit also accuses UC Medical Center of failing to supervise its employees properly, over claims that Bradley convinced Ryan Rawls and a third unidentified staff member to leak the private records.

The alleged victim says she was called a 'hoe' and 'slut' after details of her treatment for a sexually transmitted disease were put on a members-only Facebook page.

'She was absolutely devastated. That is 
the most private of private medical information that was posted on 
Facebook and went out to a group on Facebook that had a huge 
dissemination,' Mike Allen, her attorney, told WLWT.

Mr Allen wants the case to also be heard by a jury, and said the alleged incident has been damaging for his client.

'She
 doesn't want to go out. She doesn't want to talk to people. People who 
were formerly her friends have made fun of her for it,' Mr Allen said.

'She's
 chastised in the community and all of this could've been avoided if UC 
Med Center had proper protections in place.'

According to Cincinnati.com, staff were sent an email from its chief executive, Lee Ann Liska, on Wednesday, reminding them that sharing private medical records was against the law and employees could be fired for sharing information.Â 

UC Medical Center has not yet responded to a Mail Online request for comment.
