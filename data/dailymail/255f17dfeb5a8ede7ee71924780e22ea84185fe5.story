When it comes to the Superbowl there can only ever be one winner, but that also means the 'winning' t-shirts from the losing side are destined for the trash.

After the Seattle Seahawks' 43-8 victory over the Denver Broncos in February in New Jersey, thousands of Denver's 'Super Bowl champions' souvenir t-shirts are about to be put to good use and sent off to Africa.

After sitting in storage for much of the year, a youth pastor from Kansas City has shared pictures of the unusual shipment which contains tonnes of Denver Broncos’ Super Bowl XLVIII champions t-shirts that never were never released to the public at home.

Superbowl losers: The NFL is sending all of the unsold printed clothing from this years Superbowl at which the Denver Broncos lost to the Seattle Seahawks, to needy people in Africa

Unwanted: A youth pastor from Kansas City on Monday shared pictures of the Denver Broncos Super Bowl XLVIII champions T-shirts that are apparently now headed for Africa

A Chiefs fan himself, Adam Paul Cooper posted the pictures to Instagram and Twitter, adding his thoughts: 'Hahahaha.'

It's not just T-shirts but hats and other paraphernalia that will be winging its way overseas.

The NFL and manufacturers hedge their bets before the game, creating championship merchandise for both teams so they can sell it immediately after the game is over.

In the past, the NFL used to destroy all the loser merchandise, but thanks to a partnership with a charity called World Vision, it now goes to needy people all over the world.

Unworn: The apparel is usually shipped the day after the Super Bowl to a warehouse in Pittsburgh, where the charity World Vision sorts through it and ultimately sends it off to those who need it

'That’s
 really brand new, high-quality, never worn clothing that could be used 
somewhere to serve somebody who otherwise wouldn’t have access to those 
things,' World Vision’s Jim Fischerkeller told MyNorthwest.com.

'It
 was really cool for me personally to see kids on a soccer field in 
Zambia wearing Super Bowl shirts,' Fischerkeller said.

'What it does is 
fill an essential need and enables us to concentrate on our other work, 
which is clean water and food resources and those type of things.'

Although undisclosed, the order for the Broncos was a significant one given the devoted fan base.

Unused: Perfectly good clothing printed with the losers of this years Superbowl will be making its way towards those who need it most in Africa

Victory was out of reach: The NFL and manufacturers hedge their bets before the game, creating championship merchandise for both teams so they can sell it immediately after the game is over

In 2007, Sports Authority ordered more than 15,000 shirts commemorating a Chicago Bears Super Bowl victory that never happened.

The gear has gone all over the world in recent years including Haiti, Nicaragua, Romania, Bosnia and Uganda.

Items like sweatshirts and knitted hats going to cold-weather countries while T-shirts and baseball caps will go to tropical nations.

As part of World Vision's agreements, it can't distribute the merchandise in the United States to keep it off the market.

'It's just part of our holistic strategy for development in the under-served world and this part of it is really cool, especially this time of year. It's a small part of what we do, but it really helps us do all of our other work.'
