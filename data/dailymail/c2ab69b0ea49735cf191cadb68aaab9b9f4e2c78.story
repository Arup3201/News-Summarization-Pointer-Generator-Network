From the exasperatingly dull to the garishly kitsch, lunchboxes are not usually seen as a bastion of style.

This may all be about to change, however, because today sees the launch of some seriously fashionable food receptacles.

Introducing The Hemsley Slice, which claims to combine the everyday necessity of a lunchbox with the luxury of a designer bag.

The Hemsley Slice looks every part the normal designer bag but folds out into a lunch box

Making its debut at London Fashion Week the stylish sandwich bags have been created in a bid  to encourage women to love their lunch.

The Hemsley Slice appears to be nothing more than a fashionable accessory but once unfolded it reveals itself as the perfect container for a packed lunch, including a square sandwich wallet.

Commissioned by the Federation of Bakers and designed by up and coming handbag designer Jayne Hemsley of Hemsley London, the limited edition bag provides fashion conscious women everywhere the chance to bring their lunch to work in a brand new design.

A spokesman for the Federation of Bakers laments the laments the absence of sandwiches in the modern fashion fan's lunchbox and blames extreme food trends for the loss of interest in sandwiches: 'Due to fad diets, women have forgotten about the benefits of eating bread. We want to remind women that sandwiches are a healthy, nutritious lunch option, and that they are back in fashion.' 

This isn't the first time gluten has invaded the catwalks of London Fashion Week. Last year saw the launch of Eau de Toast, where models were given the chance to hit the catwalk smelling of freshly made toast.

Both 'The Hemsley Slice' and 'Eau de Toast' were created as part of the Federation's Slice of Life Campaign, which promotes bread in daily life.

For Jayne Hemsley the design is a must have and she created the bag with herself in mind.

'I love making sandwiches at home, because I know exactly what I'm putting in them, so I know I'm eating a healthy lunch. The idea to do this in style really inspired me.'

The Hemsley Slice is available in five unique colours, including pertunia (pink), anemone (dark blue), mertyl (aqua green), seedem (yellow) and sky (light blue).

Dietitian Lucy Jones is also supporting the campaign and says that bread is not something to be frightened of.

'Bread is an important part of a healthy balanced diet; it's high in fibre and calcium, and low in fat and calories - an average slice contains only 80 calories.

'Sliced bread is a great option if you're looking after your figure, as it can really help with portion control by keeping track of exactly how many calories you are consuming per slice. If you're trying to lose weight, it's important to try and choose healthy fillings for your sandwich at lunch such as egg and cress, or chicken and salad.' 

The bags will be exhibited at London Fashion Week on the Hemsley London's stand at Somerset House.

A limited run of The Hemsley Slice is available to order from today for fashionistas and lunch fans alike. To put in an order, simply fill in the request a sample form at bakersfederation.org.uk/the-hemsley-slice
