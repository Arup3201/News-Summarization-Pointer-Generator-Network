This friendly chap clearly thought he was 'one of the lads' when he photobombed a group of fishermen in southern Africa.

The curious meerkat was a constant companion of photographer Dave Lewis during his surf-fishing trips for silver kob and other fish along the wild Namibia coast.

Mr Lewis said while he and his friends stopped to fish, the meerkat would spend its days digging holes in the sand and foraging.

He said: 'This little chap's name was pronounced "curry" but spelled some other way.

'At the time, I was regularly hosting surf-fishing trips to the Skeleton Coast in Namibia, when we stopped to fish, he would spend the day digging holes in the sand and generally foraging around.

'Whenever a bird flew over, he would run to the nearest angler and sit as tight as he could to their legs for protection.

'As you can see, he loved having his photo taken.' 

Meerkats are mostly indigenous to desert areas of Africa, and are famous for their upright posture, which they use to gaze on the plains where they live and stay alert for predators

Meerkats are squirrel-sized group animals, which are part of the mongoose family.

They are mostly indigenous to desert areas of Africa, and are famous for their upright posture, which they use to gaze on the plains where they live and stay alert for predators.

The tunnel-dwellers have a varied diet of lizards, birds, insects and fruit, and can be trained as rodent-catchers due to their skills at hunting.
