A school has banned energy drinks such as Red Bull after children as young as 11 were found to be drinking up to three cans a day.

Peter Slough, headteacher at Small Heath School, Birmingham, has banned the highly caffeinated drinks after pupils were struggling to concentrate in the classroom.

Mr Slough said some pupils were consuming the drinks -  which can contain more than 13 teaspoons of sugar - instead of a proper breakfast.

Pupils now face detention if they are caught with an energy drink.

Mr Slough’s campaign has come two months after Government adviser John Vincent called for them to be banned from schools - saying energy drinks were 'effectively another form of drugs.'

Speaking today, Mr Slough said: 'These caffeine drinks, combined with a poor diet, are responsible for the children who find it difficult to sit and concentrate in class.

'We thought we would raise our battle flags. I started to research the issue, initially in the sixth form and then extended it to our Year 11 and Year 10 students.

'It became obvious that a lot of our children were drinking several cans a day - drinking them on the way to school and leaving home without breakfast.

'They were then having another at lunchtime and drinking them at home. We know that even the little ones, in Year 7, drink them.They become used to it - it becomes a habit and a worry.'

The head said after consuming energy drinks such as Red Bull and Monster, pictured, the pupils struggled to concentrate and were difficult to control in class

The school, which caters for 1,300 pupils aged between 11 and 18, was rated 'Outstanding' in all areas by an Ofsted inspection in May last year.

Mr Slough began his campaign after noticing increasing numbers of discarded energy drink cans in and around the school.

As the school is split campus, many pupils buy the drinks when moving between sites.

Government adviser and restaurateur John Vincent recently called for the drinks to be banned in schools - saying the beverages were as harmful as drugs.

He
 said drinks such as Monster, Red Bull and Relentless - many of which 
combine up to 13 teaspoons of sugar and 160mg of caffeine  (about four 
times the amount as a can of coke) - make children difficult to control.

Mr
 Vincent said: 'Energy drinks are effectively another form of drugs. The
 amount of sugar and caffeine in these drinks is in our view effectively
 allowing drugs into schools.‘We
 don’t do that and neither do we think that should be part of school 
life. It has a hugely damaging effect on their ability to concentrate, 
how they feel and it is having health effects

Currently, manufacturers
 and retailers have a voluntary ban on the sale of the drinks to 
under-16s, but there is no law to stop children buying them.

The
 Food Standards Agency advises that children limit their intake of 
drinks that are high in caffeine - saying the drinks ‘could potentially 
lead to short-term effects such as increased excitability, irritability,
 nervousness or anxiety’.

Brands including Red Bull, Monster Energy and Relentless can be bought within 300 metres of the school,, the head said.

Mr
 Slough added: 'They are energy drinks, they give you a boost. But if 
you combine them with the sweets children eat, we have a recipe for 
disaster.'

The head said any
 pupil seen with an energy drink will have it confiscated and children 
found flouting the ban twice faced an after-school detention.

Mr
 Slough’s campaign echoes the views of restaurateur and government 
adviser John Vincent, who has compiled a school food plan for education 
secretary Michael Gove.

Speaking in January, he said children could become unteachable after drinking several cans of energy drinks.

He warned: ‘Energy drinks are effectively another form of drugs.’

Mr Vincent, who co-founded the Leon restaurant group, added: ‘The amount of sugar and caffeine in these drinks is in our view effectively allowing drugs into schools.

'We don’t do that and neither do we think that should be part of school life.

'It has a hugely damaging effect on their ability to concentrate, how they feel and it is having health effects.’

The British Soft Drinks Association, which counts Red Bull and other energy drink companies as members, has spoken in favour of Mr Slough’s campaign.

The BSDA’s director general Gavin Partington said: 'We are clear that energy drinks are not recommended for children and we want to get that message across to young people and their parents.

'Our code of practice says that high caffeine content soft drinks are not recommended for children and specifies that this information should be clearly stated on the label of such drinks.

'It also states that high caffeine soft drinks should not be promoted or marketed to those under 16.'

The British Soft Drinks Association code of conduct states that energy drinks should not be sold in schools.

However,
 a Freedom of Information request last year found some academies – which
 have the right to opt out of national standards on school food and 
nutrition – were selling the drinks.

The Food Standards Agency advises that children limit their intake of drinks that are high in caffeine.

A spokesman added that consuming the drinks ‘could potentially lead to short-term effects such as increased excitability, irritability, nervousness or anxiety’.

Red Bull has been contacted by MailOnline for comment.

For comparison, a 150ml can of Coca-Cola contains 8mg caffeine and 15.0g of sugar.

According to NewHealthGuide.org, a teaspoon is roughly 4 grams of white granulated sugar.
