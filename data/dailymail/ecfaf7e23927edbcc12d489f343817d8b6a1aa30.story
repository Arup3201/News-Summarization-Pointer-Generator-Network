Hospital wards will have to earn ‘kitemarks’ to prove they properly care for the elderly.

Senior doctors are drawing up a new system which will see wards judged on their treatment of older patients.

It follows widespread concern that the elderly are frequently neglected by staff in hospital with food and drink left out of reach.

Doctors are also concerned that the elderly are routinely shipped between wards like parcels and initially put whenever there is a bed, only to be hurriedly made to move in the middle of the night because someone else needs the slot.

Starting next Spring, the Royal College of Physicians will judge hospital wards on the quality of care for elderly patients and the best will be given ‘elder friendly’ badges.

Hospitals will be urged to nominate wards and the College will consider whether staff put patients first and treat them with dignity and respect.

It will look at both surveys of patients and their relatives and representatives from the College may also visit wards to monitor how nursing staff and doctors behave.

Dr Patrick Cardigan Registrar of the Royal College of Physicians said achieving gold standard care for the elderly must be a priority

The new system was prompted by the Mid Staffordshire scandal where hundreds of patients – mainly elderly - are feared to have died through neglect between 2005 and 2009.

Earlier this year a major public inquiry called on senior doctors and nurses to make crucial changes to their working practices to prevent the disaster ever being repeated elsewhere in other hospitals.

Dr Patrick Cadigan, registrar at the College said: ‘Many of the instances of substandard care at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation trust took place in medical wards caring for our most vulnerable patients – frail older patients with complex comorbidities (a range of conditions).

‘Achieving gold standard care for this group must be the priority.

‘It will make substantial contribution to ensuring that the events at Mid Staffordshire are never repeated.’

But the College has also warned that due to a shortage of hospital beds, the elderly are frequently shunted around wards ‘like parcels’ to wherever there is room.

A patient brought in following a fall for example fracture might be placed on a stroke ward or one that specialises in kidney failure as there is no other room.

But when someone else is admitted later on for a stroke or kidney disease they are hurriedly moved – often in the middle of the night – to wherever else in the hospital there is a bed.

Starting next Spring, the Royal College of Physicians will judge hospital wards on the quality of care for elderly patients and the best will be given ¿elder friendly¿ badges

This may happen three or four times during their stay in hospital which could last two weeks.

It is highly distressing for the patient – particularly if they suffer dementia – and means the doctors and nursing staff to not get to know them or learn their needs.

The College has calculated that the moves are such a setback for the patients’ recovery that each one adds another two days onto their stay in hospital.
