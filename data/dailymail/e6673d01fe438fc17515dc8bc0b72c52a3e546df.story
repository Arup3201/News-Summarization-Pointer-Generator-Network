If you value comfort and space, these are probably not the homes for you.

A team of students from the US and UK have designed tiny houses for ‘affordable’ living.

The 3D printed homes are intended to provide an alternative for young adults struggling to get on the property ladder.

Young adults may soon be living in shell-like 3D printed homes if a project to build mini houses is realised. These 3D printed abodes would be intended to provide an alternative for the many young adults struggling to get their foot on the property ladder

The students from 3M future Lab, led by Professor and architect Peter Ebner, studied at the University of California and the University of Huddersfield.

University students in Atlanta announced the other day they have designed mini-houses for urban living.

'SCADpads' are 8 feet wide, 16 feet long and can fit in US parking spaces.

Each $40,000 abode can be individually tailored and decorated.

The team says half of America's 105 million parking spaces are empty.

And the 'housing crisis' could be solved by filling them with these homes.

Their mini-homes are about 50 square foot (4.6 square metres) and were designed as a part of a project on ‘Small Transportable Living.’

The houses are entirely 3D-printed, providing a cheaper living solution than modern homes.

The houses are dome or mussel shaped and could be placed in various locations around the world.

Their portability and small size means that, in theory, they could be taken to places where regular houses could not be placed.

When closed, the top level of the home serves as a bed with the ‘spring mattress’, which is also 3D printed.

The closed structure is entered and exited via a small door located on the wall.

A projector is also included inside, allowing multimedia such as movies to be viewed inside the mini-home.

At the top a small eye-like window provides light inside the claustrophobic environment.

On the ‘ground floor’ is a movable kitchen countertop.

This also has a sink that covers a ‘bathtub’ of sorts.

A small kitchen can be extended that, apparently, is comfortable enough for two people.

There’s even a fridge for you to store food and drink.

And Ebner tells MailOnline that the illustrations you can see here are accurate representations of how much space would be inside each of the prototype houses.

He stresses, however, that he will not be bringing the products to market - they are merely intended as an example to show what is possible.

All the parts for the homes are 3D printed and then put together, including the bed and the sewage system

Here the 'bedroom' area is shown with a 'spring mattress' to sleep on. The team of students, headed by Professor and architect Peter Ebner, developed the 3D printed houses to offer comfortable accommodation on a smaller but much more affordable scale

Last year, the graduate students of 3M futureLAB teamed up with other students from Germany and England to explore the topic of Small Transportable Living. The students from 3M future LAB studied at the University of California and University of Huddersfield

A projector inside the home allows you to watch TV shows and movies while you are 'relaxing'

The ‘bathroom,’ also found on the ground floor, has a folding toilet that is hidden in the wall when not in use. The house even has a shower as well.

The entire home is designed to be 3D printed, including the electricity, heating, water, sewage systems and thermal insulation.

‘Returning to the 3D printing topic, it is necessary to underline that the apartment was printed on a highly detailed level,’ the company said in a release.

On top of the world: The designers suggest their 3D printed homes could be placed in less accessible locations around the world such as, supposedly, on top of mountains and hills

‘So for example you can see the mattress springs, heating, water, electricity sewage systems and thermal insulation.'

However, according 
to the company, heater and water treatment devices are not able to be 
printed yet so non-3D printed replacements are used for now.

The hope is that the finished fully-3D printed homes could provide a solution for housing young adults around the world.

It is rumoured that a Chinese company is interested in manufacturing the product on a large scale to the order of hundreds.

Ebner says he is not involved in talks with them at the moment, but he would be involved 'for sure' if they got in touch.

All of the components of the houses are 3D printed save for the heating and water treatment devices
