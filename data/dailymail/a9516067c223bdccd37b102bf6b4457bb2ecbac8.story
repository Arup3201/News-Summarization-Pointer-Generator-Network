Jobless: Veteran anchor Vince DeMentri, 50, was fired from WICS-TV in Illinois - his third job in less than seven years - after he got into a brawl with a reporter

Trouble seems to follow news anchor Vince DeMentri wherever he goes.

The veteran TV presenter was fired from his third job in less than seven years after he got into a fight with a colleague from the station WICS in Springfield, Illinois.

The incident took place at around 12.30am last Wednesday in the parking lot of a Hooters restaurant on Horizon Drive.

Police officers were called to the scene after getting reports of an altercation between two people, later identified as DeMentri and WICS reporter Garrett Brngr.

One of the pugilists was reportedly observed bleeding from the nose, according to Illinois Times. 

By the time police arrived, the brawlers had left in their respective vehicles, a black BMW and a black Jeep.

Police later pulled over one of the pugnacious newsmen, who claimed that he had fallen from a stool.

This is only the latest in a series of unfortunate events involving the 50-year-old DeMentri.

The award-winning journalist was fired from NBC10 in Philadelphia in 2008 for allegedly keying a co-anchor's Lexus, stalking her and hiding items from her desk after two-year their extramarital affair ended.

Details of the ugly breakup were revealed after DeMentri claimed in court papers that he was unfairly fired over the tryst while his former paramour, then-28-year-old Lori Delgado, was allowed to keep her job.

DeMentri then moved on to WPIX in New York, which also let him go in 2010 after he was accused of slapping the driver of the Bahamian ambassador to the United Nations in a spat over a parking spot.

The quick-tempered reporter was slapped with an assault charge but was later acquitted.

DeMentri, a Temple University graduate, got his start in TV journalism working as a sports producer for WPVI-TV. Over the course of his 20-year career, he’s picked up seven Emmys and a pair of Edward R. Murrow awards.

Two days after the September 11 attacks, DeMentri was arrested for impersonating a federal agent in a bid to access Ground Zero, reported the New York Daily News.

A charge of trespassing against the intrepid news gatherer was later thrown out.

Speaking to the Daily News after his 2010 arrest, DeMentri said that he was being unfairly portrayed in the media as 'one of the bad boys,' even though he's never been convicted of any crime.

The station manager of WICS-TV in Illinois told the State Journal Register in 2012 that they had looked into the incidents involving DeMentri, which turned out to be a 'non-issue' for them.

‘I don’t think you can judge anybody’s character by an incident or two in life,’ DeMentri said at the time.

Both DeMentri and Brgnr's biographies have been removed from WICS-TV's website since the fisticuffs in the Hooters parking lot last week. 

‘Vince DeMentri and Garrett Brnger are no longer with the station,’ WICS General Manager Rick Lipps said in a Facebook post.
