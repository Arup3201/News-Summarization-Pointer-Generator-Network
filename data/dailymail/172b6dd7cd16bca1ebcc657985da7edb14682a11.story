Tottenham are closing in on a £35million double swoop for Morgan Schneiderlin and Jay Rodriguez as Southampton’s exodus continues.

The White Hart Lane club are in advanced talks over moves for the duo and are hopeful of completing a deal by the end of the week.

Should Spurs’ attempt to sign the pair prove successful, Rodriguez and Schneiderlin would take the total of high-profile exits from St Mary’s to seven.

Out the door: Rodriguez is also on the verge of a move to Tottenham as the Saints exodus continues

Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert have joined Liverpool, Luke Shaw has moved to Manchester United and Calum Chambers completed his switch to Arsenal on Monday.

So far, new Saints boss Ronald Koeman has signed just two players Dusan Tadic from FC Twente and Feyenood’s Graziano Pelle.

However, Saints executive director Les Reed moved reassure fans, saying: 'It is important in the transfer window to remain calm, resilient and above all patient. We have targets and we are working hard to get them across the line.

‘Our position remains unchanged in that we are determined to keep our best young players at the club.

'We have an abundance of talent in the
 academy coming through, and everybody at the club is continuing to work
 hard on bringing in quality new players as we build a team capable of 
taking us further forward in the coming seasons.'

International honours: The Southampton midfielder was in the France squad for the World Cup

Schneiderlin, 24, represented France at this summer's World Cup and has attracted interest from Arsenal, although he is understood to favour a move to Spurs so he can work with Mauricio Pochettino again.

The former Argentina international is also in for Rodriguez, despite the England forward currently being sidelined by an anterior cruciate ligament injury.

The 24-year-old has been at St Mary's since joining from hometown club Burnley two years ago and made his Three Lions debut in November's friendly against Chile.

Their exits would be another hammer blow to recently-appointed manager Ronald Koeman, who is also expected to sell disruptive club-record signing Dani Osvaldo in the coming weeks.
