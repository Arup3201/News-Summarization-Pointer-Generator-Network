The last of the 29 Navajos whose tribal language was used to develop a code that stumped the Japanese during the Second World War has died aged 93.

Chester Nez, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, died Wednesday morning of kidney failure, Judy Avila, who helped Nez write his memoirs, said.

He was one of seven veterans honored for their bravery in November last year, when he was presented with the Audie Murphy Award for distinguished service.

Before hundreds of men from the Navajo 
Nation became Code Talkers, 29 Navajos were recruited to develop the 
code based on their then-unwritten language.Â 

Nez was in 10th grade when he enlisted, 
keeping his decision a secret from his family and lying about his age, 
as did many others.

The U.S. Marines used codetalkers in every Pacific assault from 1942 to 1945.

The Native Americans used a code based on their language, which was never cracked by the Japanese.

It was estimated that outside of tribes, fewer than 30 people understood the Najavo lanaguage during the Second World War.

Native American language had also been used for code purposes in the First World War.

The
 code was made up of unrelated Najavo words that would be translated 
into English. The first letter of the translated word would then be used
 to build up the message.

When
 the Marines developed the code they had to create new words in the 
language to incorporate military terms, including 'besh-lo' meaning iron
 fish for submarine, and 'dah-he-tih-hi', which translates as humming 
bird, for fighter planes.

The
 Windtalkers, as the Native American Marines became known, were 
essential to the war effort, with Major Howard Connor, a 5th Marine 
Division signal officer, saying: 'Were it not for the Navajos, the 
Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.'

'It's one of the greatest parts of history that we used our own native language during World War II,' Nez told The Associated Press in 2010. 'We're very proud of it.'

Of the 250 Navajos who showed up at Fort Defiance, Arizona, - then a U.S. Army base - 29 were selected to join the first all-Native American unit of Marines.

They were inducted in May 1942. Nez became part of the 382nd Platoon.

Using Navajo words for red soil, war chief, clan, braided hair, beads, ant and hummingbird, for example, they came up with a glossary of more than 200 terms that later was expanded, and an alphabet.

Nez has said he was concerned the code wouldn't work. At the time, few non-Navajos spoke the language. Even Navajos who did couldn't understand the code. It proved impenetrable.

'I was very proud to say that the Japanese did everything in their power to break that code but they never did,' he told Stars and Stripes last year.

Having his language used as a code was a big step for Nez, who recalled how he and other Native American boys would have their mouths washed out with soap for speaking it at government boarding schools.

When he was a child, the Navajo language was all Nez spoke, as he helped his family tend sheep on a reservation.

He was eventually sent to a government-run boarding school that had been set up to assimilate Native Americans with mainstream culture, according to the Washington Times.

The Navajos trained in radio 
communications for the war effort were walking copies of the code. Each message read aloud 
by a Code Talker was immediately destroyed.

'The Japanese did everything in their power to break the code but they never did,' Nez said in 2010.

After the war Nez volunteered to serve two more years during the Korean War. He retired in 1974 after a 25-year career as a painter at the Veterans hospital in Albuquerque.

Nez was eager to tell his family about his role as a Code Talker, Avila said, but he couldn't. Their mission wasn't declassified until 1968.

The accolades came much later. The Code Talkers are now widely celebrated. The original group received Congressional Gold Medals in 2001, and a movie - WIndtalkers - which was based on the unit was released the following year.

They have appeared on television and in parades, and routinely are asked to speak to veterans groups and students.

Nez
 threw the opening pitch at a 2004 Major League Baseball game and 
offered a blessing for the presidential campaign of John Kerry.

In
 2012, he received a bachelor's degree from the University of Kansas, 
where he abandoned his studies in fine arts after money from his GI Bill
 ran out.

Despite having both legs partially amputated, confining him to a wheelchair, Avila said Nez loved to travel and tell his story.

'He always wanted to go, he loved meeting people,' she said. 'And with something like kidney failure, it comes really gradually. At the end, he was really tired.'

Funeral arrangements are pending.
