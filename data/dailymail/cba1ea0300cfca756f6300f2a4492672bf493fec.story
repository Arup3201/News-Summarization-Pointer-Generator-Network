Richard Cockerill sounded a defiant note after Leicester’s third successive Aviva Premiership defeat – 33-16 away to Gloucester at Kingsholm. 

The Tigers’ director of rugby bristled at criticism of his injury-decimated team’s recent results, saying: ‘We’ve got a great system with really good people and chucking mud at that whole environment is wrong.’

Conor O’Shea also slammed critics after his Harlequins side thrashed London Welsh 52-0, saying: ‘If anybody thinks we are going away, you can think again. For people to write us off after four games was pretty insulting.’

Argentina claimed their inaugural Rugby Championship victory on Saturday night in Mendoza. 

The Pumas rallied from a 14-0 deficit to claim a 21-17 win over Australia – built on tries by Leonardo Senatore and Juan Imhoff.

It was the Wallabies’ first loss against the South American nation since 1997, but the visitors were aggrieved as a laser shone from the crowd appeared to distract Bernard Foley as he missed a late penalty from close range. 

Earlier in the day, a late penalty from 55 metres by Patrick Lambie clinched a 27-25 triumph for South Africa over the All Blacks in Cape Town. It was only New Zealand’s second defeat since the last World Cup.

Player of the week: Ben Morgan. 

The England No 8 was at the vanguard of a dominant display by the Gloucester pack against Leicester. 

Richard Hibbard and Sione Kalamafoni were similarly impressive but Morgan deservedly earned the Man of the Match award for his rampaging exhibition of forceful ball-carrying.

Coach of the week: Anthony Foley 

Foley had endured a tough start to his tenure as Munster’s new head coach, with two home Pro12 defeats. 

This represented a crisis of sorts, but it was alleviated on Saturday as Munster beat Leinster 34-23 at the Aviva Stadium – a first away win over their major Irish rivals since 2008.
