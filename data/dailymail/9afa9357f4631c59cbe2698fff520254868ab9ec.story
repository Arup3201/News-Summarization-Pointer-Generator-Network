There have been countless schemes designed to stop people texting at the wheel but the latest takes it to the next level by publicly shaming the offenders.

Large adverts will appear across the Bay area of San Francisco throughout April featuring photos of residents who have been snapped using their phones while driving. 

The photos will also be uploaded to the Texting While In Traffic (TWIT) website to ‘put an end to distracted driving.’

The shaming billboards will be set up across the Bay area of San Francisco throughout April. People can also submit photos of drivers texting at the wheel to the Texting While In Traffic (TWIT) website. The scheme was set up by graphic designer Brian Singer

According to the National Occupant 
Protection Use Survey (NOPUS) in the U.S., approximately 660,000 drivers 
use their phones or other electronic devices while driving - a number 
that has held steady since 2010. 

Researchers
 from the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute additionally found 
sending or receiving a text takes a driver's eyes from the road for an 
average of 4.6 seconds - the equivalent of driving 55mph (88km/h)
across the length of an American football field, blind.

Meanwhile, 80 per cent of vehicle crashes involve some sort of driver distraction,
 and using hands-free devices can still significantly distract drivers. 

The TWIT scheme was created by graphic designer Brian Singer who told Gizmodo he set up the website when he noticed how many people were using their phones in their cars during his commute in San Francisco.

Texting while driving is illegal in California.

Many of the photos on the TWIT project site were taken and contributed by other concerned residents. 

Singer said: ‘Though documentation and public sharing, we hope to both raise awareness, and affect a behavioural change in society.’

Although the site is called Texting While In Traffic, Singer also encourages people to submit photos of any activity that could be deemed as distracting including applying make-up, reading or eating. In a number of the photos, Singer has circled the phone to make it clearer, pictured

The photos have to be taken by passers-by, as opposed to people in the car, and every photo must show the person’s face as well as the phone, or distraction.
