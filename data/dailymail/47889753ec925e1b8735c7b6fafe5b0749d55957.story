Wigan chairman Dave Whelan has claimed Leicester have had a bid accepted for midfielder James McArthur.

But Sportsmail understands there is still work to be done on the deal and Esteban Cambiasso has expressed a desire to join Nigel Pearson’s team.

Whether both central midfield signings are concluded remains to be seen. Former Argentina international Cambiasso would arrive on a free transfer while McArthur could cost up to £6.5million.

Whelan told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Leicester came back in this morning and wanted a quick answer, it was all sorted out pretty quickly.

‘We are disappointed to lose James but he can play in the Premier League again which is what he deserves. Leicester have been an absolute credit throughout the negotiations.

‘The money will go towards bringing new signings and Uwe [Rosler, the manager] is already working on targets.
