Relatives have spoken of their shock after a U.S. police officer shot dead his British wife, mother-in-law and two young children before turning the gun on himself.

Days after returning from a Christmas break in Disneyworld, Florida, Joshua Boren killed Kelly Boren 32, her mother Marie King, 55, his seven-year-old son Jaden and daughter Haley, five, at their home in Utah.

All five bodies were discovered in bedrooms after Lieutenant Boren, 34, failed to turn up for a night shift.

Hours earlier, Mrs Boren, a school administrator from Northampton, had posted happy family photographs on Facebook.

Those close to Joshua and Kelly Boren 
said they knew the couple had been having marital problems but never 
thought he was capable of such a violent act.

'Nobody
 knew that this was coming. Nobody was expecting this to happen from 
him,' said Joshua Boren's 17-year-old niece Ashley Ohran.

They
 spoke at a vigil Saturday night in Spanish Fork, a city of about 36,000
 people located 9 miles south of Provo, home of Brigham Young 
University. They were unsure of the events leading up to the shooting.

'Everybody says how horrible my uncle was,' Ashley Ohran, 17, Joshua Boren's niece told the Deseret News. 'That's the thing, my uncle was the best person ever. He was a great guy.'

Kelly was remembered as a loving wife, mother, and fitness enthusiast

Spanish Fork police say the 
34-year-old officer of the Lindon Police Department shot his wife, 32; 
his mother-in-law, Marie King, 55; and his two children, Joshua 'Jaden' 
Boren, 7, and Haley Boren, 5, before killing himself.

They were found dead in their home late Thursday night, and police are 
still investigating a motive. The Lindon department counts about 15 
uniformed officers and patrols a city of about 10,000.

More
 than 100 people packed a Gold's Gym to remember and share stories of 
the family, the newspaper reported. Kelly Boren was a fitness fanatic 
who worked out there.

She and her husband often socialized and went hiking with a group of 10 close friends.

RiRi Whiting, Kelly Boren's close friend and a vigil organiser, said she never saw a temper in Joshua Boren and thought he was a good father. Now, she says she's overwhelmed with anger.

Friends and family say that Joshua Boren was 'a great guy' and say they never would have expected him to shoot his family and then himself

'It's a super selfish act,' Whiting said. 'I don't know what state of mind a person can be in to do that, especially to children. When children are involved, it just makes me sick.'

Friend James Bjerregaard also remembered Joshua Boren as a good father.

'Josh wasn't a bad guy. He was a gentle, personable guy,' he said. 'I think it's kind of too fresh to really know what my opinions and thoughts will be of him down the road.'

Kelly Boren, who was finance director for the city of Bluffdale, was remembered as a sweet, funny woman dedicated to her family.

'She just had that smile that was contagious that I personally wanted to be around," friend Travis Young said. "You just don't forget somebody like that, that spirit, that aura, whatever you want to call it. That goodness about them."

Investigators did not find a suicide note or other message to explain the shooting.

A funeral for the family will begin at 11 a.m. Wednesday at Lindquist Mortuary in Layton.

Joshua also shot Kelly's 55-year-old mother Marie King

Haley and Jaden were discovered dead in their home along with the bodies of their mother, father, and grandmother
