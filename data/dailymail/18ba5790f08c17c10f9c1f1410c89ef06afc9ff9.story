It's the hilarious prank that turned a walk in the park into a wild bunga bunga party.

Pranksters Roman Atwood and Dennis Roadys pitched a tent in various outdoor spaces like parks and sidewalks and viciously shook it from the inside as an audio recording of a woman in the throes of passion plays loudly.

The not-so-subtle YouTube clip has gone viral with nearly 400,000 views.

But it's the hilarious reactions of unsuspecting passersby that really makes the footage so watchable.

A group of three young men laugh hysterically, holding their sides, as the tent shakes behind them.

One pedestrian stops talking on his phone and holds it up next to the shaking tent so the person he is talking to can hear the screams of the woman.

Another man starts taking photos of the vibrating tent, while security guards poke around at the entrance of the structure to see what's going on.

But the prank doesn't go down well with law enforcers, who received numerous reports from concerned locals that a woman was being assaulted in the tent.

One of the officers opened the tent and demanded the pranksters hand over their identification.

'Do you have ID because this has been called in as a rape?' the irate officer demands, as another two cops stand nearby.

'You know who I am...Is there any crime committed,' the prankster, who can't be seen on camera, said, acknowledging he is already known to local police.

The officer responds that a crime may have been committed. 

'Yeah there might be [a crime committed] once we talk to the prosecutor's office,' he said. 'We're going to send it up because that's, that's just what's going to happen.'

Atwood and Roadys are prolific pranksters, with close to 1.5 million followers on YouTube and across other social media platforms.

According to Columbus Underground, Atwood has been filming and producing videos since high school, including a series of DVDs called 'The Nerd Herd' which he sold at Warp Tour 2006.

Roadys started performing standup comedy when he was 17 in Cincinnati, and served in the U.S. Army from 2001 to 2010.

The comedy duo met each other through a Craigslist advertisement several years ago.

'We film for fun. Comedy is what we all enjoy. Our videos just recently became 'wildly popular' and definitely surpassed our expectations,' Roadys told Columbus Underground.

'Before, we were just another YouTube channel. Now, we have been dubbed a 'viral video production team' by whatsgoodmusic.com and 'the new internet standard' by a TBS Television Producer.'
