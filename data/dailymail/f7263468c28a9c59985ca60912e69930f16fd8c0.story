Manchester United are maintaining interest in Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels but his father has rejected the possibility of a move this window.

Throughout the past few weeks, speculation has heightened that Hummels would depart to United for £35million but the player has insisted he will see the season through.

Speaking to Sky News in Germany, Hermann Hummels, the World Cup winner's father and agent, said that the centre back will not leave.

'There is nothing to it,' he said when asked about a potential January transfer.

United have maintained they will move for major targets in January should they become available and Hummels is on their list.

The 26-year-old has failed to replicate the form he exhibited last year though, and Dortmund are enduring a disastrous campaign which has seen them plummet to second bottom of the Bundesliga.

Hummels missed large parts of the opening stages of the season through injury, and has struggled for form. He and his sought-after team-mate Marco Reus resumed training at Dortmund on Wednesday following the winter break.
