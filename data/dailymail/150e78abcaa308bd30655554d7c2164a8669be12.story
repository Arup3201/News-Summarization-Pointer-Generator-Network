Alexander Wang's diffusion collection for  H&M is being touted as one of the hottest high street collaborations ever.

And although the range doesn't hit stores until November the hype has been building since the fashionable partnership was announced at Coachella festival back in April.

Fashion industry darling Rihanna, 26, was the first celebrity to be seen wearing the coveted collection, stepping out in a crop top and leggings in New York on Sunday.

And now three model images of the sporty fashion line have been released by the brand. 

The first pictures of the Alexander Wang X H&M collection have been released, including this womenswear outfit featuring logo'd leggings and a crop top combo paired with black sliders and a voluminous grey coat

Pictures of two menswear outfits and one womenswear outfit were released via the H&M Instagram account on Thursday.

The androgynous range reflects the designer's signature sports luxe  vibe, coming in a sombre colour palette of black, grey and white.

Voluminous coats are paired with sporty leggings and beanies for both boys and girls, giving an urban, minimalist look.

Alexander, 30, announced the collaboration on Instagram in April before attending a star-studded party in its honor at Coachella Festival in California.

Famous for his love of street style and sportswear, he joins fashion giants Versace, Karl Lagerfeld, Stella McCartney and Marni in the H&M hall of fashion fame.

In July the American designer took to Instagram to offer a first glimpse of some pieces from the line - including a key fob featuring two boxing gloves.

Other sneak peeks have included a close-up of a rubber and nylon flip-flop and a logo-heavy yoga mat, indicating that the collection will boast a decidedly athletic feel.

The designer has many famous fans including Cheryl Cole and Kendall Jenner, 18, who wore one of his pieces for a magazine cover launch party earlier this week.

The model paired a sheer top by the designer with relaxed, hitched-up joggers and sharp pointed-toe heels. She styled the look with simple straight hair and minimal make-up.  

Additional details regarding the collection, including prices and the full range of designs, are yet to be released.
