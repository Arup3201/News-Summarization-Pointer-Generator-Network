All new mothers need the odd break from the demands of their new baby and for Zara Phillips, that meant a day out with husband Mike Tindall at the races.

The royal, 32, looked happy and full of smiles as she watched the action on the first day of Cheltenham Festival with friends.

Resplendent in a feathered hat and ladylike cream coat, she looked thoroughly glamorous, with oversized sunglasses and a pair of diamond studs completing a very fashionable picture.

Since becoming a mother, equestrienne Zara has become a regular fixture at the races, including a recent outing to the point-to-point at Barbury in Wiltshire with baby Mia in tow.

This time round, she was later joined by husband Mike 
Tindall who, like his wife, appeared ready to enjoy a right royal laugh during a break from babysitting duties.

And the famous pair weren't the only A-list names to descend on the course. Also spotted enjoying the event was Katie Price, her third husband, Kieran Hayler in tow, and Dame Kelly Holmes.

Ms Price appeared particularly excited about events on the track and, at one point, was photographed jumping for joy as a horse she'd had a flutter on romped home to victory.

Looking equally thrilled was former Barclay's boss, the aptly named Rich Ricci, who was spotted whooping with delight and throwing up his arms after watching his horse Vautour triumph in the Sky Bet Supreme Novices Hurdle.

Low key: Other guests may not have had a horse in the race but still got to indulge in a winter picnic complete with lashings of Champagne

Furry fashion: Racegoers combined cosy fur hats with elegant wool coats and chic designer bags as they arrived at Cheltenham

While not everyone got to see their own horse in action, there was plenty of fun to be had with other guests spotted indulging in winter picnics that came complete with lashings of Champagne.

As with the picnics, festival fashion also had a hint of practical luxury with cosy wool coats combined with designer sunglasses, glamorous jewelled necklaces and twinkling diamond studs.

But while Zara plumped for a strikingly fur-free look, others chose to take the Pippa Middleton approach to winter dressing and like the Duchess of Cambridge's sister, photographed at last year's event in a realistic looking fur hat, sported ostentatiously furry headgear.
