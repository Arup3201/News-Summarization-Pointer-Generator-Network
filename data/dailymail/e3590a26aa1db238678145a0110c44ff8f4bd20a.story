Apple, Samsung and Amazon are each trying to lure new customers with futuristic technologies such as fingerprint scanners, 3D graphics and eyeball-tracking technology.

However, a recent poll has revealed the majority of smartphone owners simply want a phone that’s easy to use and has a long battery life.

In fact, almost three quarters said they refuse to be swayed by gimmicks and novelty features.

The poll was conducted by London-based uSwitch.com. Long battery life (stock image pictured) was listed as the top reason for buying a phone among 89% of respondents, with a waterproof case being the second most popular feature among 67% of people who took part in the study

The poll was carried out by London-based uSwitch.com using an online survey of more than 1,605 mobile customers on pay-monthly contracts.

Long battery life would make 89 per cent of respondents more likely to buy a smartphone, while a waterproof body (67 per cent) and a zoom camera lens (66 per cent) were in second and third place.

Three quarters (75 per cent) said eyeball-tracking technology - as seen on the Samsung Galaxy S5 - would make no difference to their purchasing decision, while 69 per cent said they wouldn’t be lured by a phone with a voice control function, like Apple’s Siri or Samsung’s S Voice.

More than six in 10 said 3D graphics, as shown off at the US launch of Amazon’s Fire Phone, wouldn’t make them any more or less likely to buy a handset, either.

More than six in 10 said 3D graphics, as shown off by Amazon chief executive Jeff Besos (pictured) at the US launch of Amazon’s Fire Phone, wouldn’t make them any more or less likely to buy a handset, either

Of those who already have these features, almost two thirds (66 per cent) admitted to never using eyeball tracking, and more than half (55 per cent) never use voice control.

Interestingly, almost a third (32 per cent) who have fingerprint-scanning security have never used it.

Almost one in eight of the respondents said they don’t own a smartphone, but have a feature phone instead.

Of these people, nearly half said they simply don’t feel they need a smartphone, while 28 per cent are put off by the cost. 

Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, said: ‘It’s becoming increasingly hard for smartphone makers to differentiate their handsets from those of their rivals. 

'They hope that flash features like Fingerprint ID on the iPhone 5S, or Amazon’s Fire Phone and its ‘Dynamic Perspective’ display, will give their phones the edge.

‘However, our research shows that many can spot a gimmick from a mile away.

It’s actually the basics that affect the everyday user experience - like long battery life and a robust design - that people really care about.’

‘That being said, it doesn’t take long for science fiction to become science fact in the mobile world, and features that we considered to be gimmicks just a couple of years ago like touchscreens and front-facing cameras are now integral to our daily smartphone experience.

‘So whilst great handsets are available that do the job, sometimes a bit of futuristic phone tech is just what’s needed to move the industry forward.’
