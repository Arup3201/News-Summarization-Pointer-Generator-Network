Cosby, best known for his role as Dr Heathcliff Huxtable in the The Cosby Show, has however never been  charged with rape in a court of law.

Last month, stand-up comedian and former Saturday Night Live writer Hannibal Buress unleashed a violent tirade about Cosby, calling him a 'rapist' and a sanctimonious hypocrite during a live performance.

'Bill Cosby has the f***ing smuggest old black man public persona that I hate,' Buress declared from the stage at the Trocadero Theater in Cosby's hometown of Philadelphia.

Buress said: '''Pull your pants up, black people. I was on TV in the '80s. I can talk down to you because I had a successful sitcom." Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby. So, brings you down a couple notches.' 

In fact, one woman, Barbara Bowman, came forward and shared her story with MailOnline in the wake of Burress' outburst.

'I was drugged and raped by that man,' she revealed. 

'He is a monster. He came at me like a monster. My hope is that others who have experienced sexual abuse will not be intimidated into silence by the famous, rich and powerful. If I can help one victim, then I've done my job.'

Bowman was just a teenager at the time she met Cosby, and soon the actor was flying her to meet him around the country and putting her up in the nicest hotels.

Things changed however when one night she passed out after a glass of wine and woke up vomiting in the toilet wearing Cosby's white t-shirt. Bowman is certain that she had been drugged by Cosby. And she believes raped by him too.

Telling her story: Barbara Bowman told MailOnline how Cosby raped and drugged her' while she was just a teenager

After that her relationship with Cosby changed, and by 19 he had sent her on her way after a final night in Atlantic City where she claims he tried to rape her. 

In 2006, Cosby settled a civil lawsuit with Andrea Constand, 32, a former Temple University employee who claimed Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia mansion in 2004.

It was at that trial that 13 women came forward to allege they too were drugged and sexually abused by Cosby.  

Cosby has not commented on any of the allegations since they have resurfaced.
