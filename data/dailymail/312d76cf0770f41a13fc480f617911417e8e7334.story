In Quincy, California, it is against the law to drive without ice cream - at least according to a hilarious new ad featuring local cops with a sense of humor and a sweet tooth.

In the commercial advertising Wall's Ice Cream, a group of officers from Quincy pulled over a half-dozen unsuspecting motorists - only to surprise them with Cornetto ice cream cones.

The video, which has gone viral over the past week, begins with a stern-looking, real-life Plumas County Sheriff Greg Hagwood talking about how serious being a cop is.
