It proved to be a defining moment during her time as Prime Minister and in death, the Falklands War will again play a key role.

Further details of Baroness Thatcher’s funeral arrangements emerged yesterday and her military triumph in the South Atlantic will take centre stage.

Outside St Paul’s, the gun carriage carrying her coffin will be greeted by a guard of honour formed of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, the regiment which lost 32 men in the bombing of the troop ship Sir Galahad during the 1982 conflict.

Military honours from parliament to st pauls

The ten-strong bearer party has been deliberately chosen from ships, units and stations ‘notable for their service during the Falklands Campaign’.

In all, more than 700 members of the Armed Forces will take part in the funeral next Wednesday, lining the streets as the cortege travels the two miles from Westminster to the cathedral.

David Cameron said: ‘In a week from now, as people gather in London to lay Margaret Thatcher to rest, the sun will be rising over the Falklands. And because of her courage, and the skill, bravery and sacrifice of our Armed Forces – it will rise again for freedom.’

Details of the service and the official guest list will be released in the coming days as a Whitehall committee draws up plans to execute Operation True Blue, the codename for the funeral.

The Bishop of London, the Right Rev Richard Chartres, will preach the sermon at the funeral. A friend of the Prince of Wales who knows the Thatcher family, he was, ironically, at the centre of a fierce row at the Falklands thanksgiving service between Lady Thatcher and then Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Robert Runcie.

She furiously accused Dr Runcie of being unpatriotic when, preaching a message of reconciliation rather than triumphalism, he asked the congregation to pray for relatives of the Argentine dead. The sermon was written by the Archbishop’s chaplain at the time – Richard Chartres.

There is expected to be music from Elgar and a selection of hymns and readings agreed by Lady Thatcher and her aides, including William Wordsworth’s ‘Ode: Intimations of Immortality’.

The final bill for the funeral may approach £10million. Lady Thatcher’s family is meeting an unspecified amount of the expense, thought to cover transport, flowers and the cremation, with the Government funding the rest, including security.

Foreign Secretary William Hague said: ‘When it comes to money, the rebate she negotiated for this country from the EU has brought us so far £75billion…I think that puts money in perspective.’

The widow of Falklands war hero Lieutenant Colonel Herbert ‘H’ Jones has been invited to Lady Thatcher’s funeral.

The 42-year-old officer was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross when he was shot charging an Argentine trench while commanding 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, during the Battle of Goose Green.

His wife Sara, who has received a CBE for her services to forces charities, will attend the service at St Paul’s.

Freda McKay, the mother of Sergeant Ian McKay, who also won a posthumous VC, is expected to be invited.

The 29-year-old who served with 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment laid down his life to save his comrades when he fell taking on an Argentine gun post.

Others military personnel tipped to be invited include Major General Julian Thompson, who commanded 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines in the conflict, General Sir Michael Rose, who commanded the SAS during the conflict, and General Sir Peter de la Billiere, British commander during the first Gulf War.

The bearer party will include representatives of the Scots Guards, who fought one of the bloodiest battles of the conflict with Argentina – the night assault on Mount Tumbledown – and the Parachute Regiment, who turned the tide of the war by re-capturing Goose Green.

Once the coffin is transferred from a hearse to a gun carriage, this is the route it will take to the doors of St Paul's

Did Baroness Thatcher face a tougher job as prime minister than David Cameron does today?

FAMILY: Her twin children Sir Mark and Carol Thatcher will lead the family mourners.

Both Mark’s present and ex-wife are expected to be at the service.

Sir Mark, 59, who has spent 25 years living and working abroad will be accompanied by his second wife Sarah, whom he married in 2008.

His first wife, Diane, who lives in Dallas, Texas, is expected to travel to London next week accompanied by the couple’s two children, Michael, 24, and 19-year-old Amanda – Lady Thatcher’s only grandchildren.

Carol Thatcher is expected to be accompanied by Swiss ski–instructor Marco Grass, her on-off partner who has shared an apartment with her in the upmarket Swiss ski resort of Klosters for the past 20 years.

ROYAL FAMILY: The Queen and Prince Philip broke with tradition by agreeing to attend the funeral.

The only other time a reigning monarch had attended the final farewell of a Prime Minister was in 1965, when the Queen joined the congregation for the funeral of Winston Churchill. The extraordinary gesture delighted Lady Thatcher’s friends and allies disappointed that she would not be honoured with a full state funeral.

No other members of the Royal Family will be present.

WORLD LEADERS: President Obama and wife, Michelle, are expected to be invited along with the first President George Bush, who was in the White House while Lady Thatcher was in Downing Street, and his wife, Barbara, but it has not yet been made clear who will make the trip.

Former First Lady Nancy Reagan, 91, will not travel to London and had asked the chairman of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation to represent her.

‘Mrs Reagan is heartbroken over Baroness Thatcher’s death and would really like to be there in person to pay her respects,’ said her spokeswoman. ‘Unfortunately, she is no longer able to make that kind of a trip, so will not be attending the funeral.’

The last president of apartheid South Africa, FW de Klerk, will attend.

De Klerk, who ordered the release of Nelson Mandela from jail and then agreed to the negotiations that ended apartheid, will be with his wife, Elita.

Others likely to be invited include Mikhail Gorbachev, the former president of the Soviet Union.

POLITICIANS: David Cameron will be joined by former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie, and his successor Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah.

Sir John Major will be among senior politicians from the Thatcher years much in evidence but there may be a couple of notable exceptions.

Her political opponent Lord Kinnock and his wife Glenys are likely to snub her funeral. When Lord Heseltine, the former Conservative Cabinet Minister who launched the leadership contest that ended  Baroness Thatcher’s rule, was asked if he would attend her funeral, he did not respond.

THE RITZ: Ten members of staff from the Ritz, where Baroness Thatcher died on Monday, have been invited to her funeral as thanks for the care she received.

HER CARERS: Constant companions, New Zealanders Kate and Janice, and her ever-faithful police protection officers are expected to be inside St Paul’s.

GRANTHAM: Councillor Kelham Cooke of the Grantham and Stamford Conservative Association said that around 20 of their members were expected to make the journey to London and planned to line the route of the funeral procession in order to pay their respects.
