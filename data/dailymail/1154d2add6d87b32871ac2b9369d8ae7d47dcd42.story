Seven of 15 men detained during Sydney's terror raids were members of a Muslim street preaching group,  led by wanted terrorist Mohammad Al Baryalei, it has been claimed.

The men were volunteers for the Parramatta Street Dawah group, which 'reverts' random members of the public to Islam in spontaneous ceremonies on the street, according to Fairfax reports.

The local council, assisted by police, had recently banned the group from operating on the streets of Parramatta in Sydney's west, after the council received complaints that the group was preaching and handing out pamphlets.

The manager of Parramatta Mosque, Neil El-Kadomi confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the seven young men who were detained prayed at Parramatta mosque, and were often seen professing their faith on the streets. 

Mr El-Kadomi is shocked at their arrest, telling Daily Mail that the young men were 'very nice men, just normal kids.'

'You saw them in the street and in the mosque and they were very nice young men,' said Mr El-Kadomi. 

It is alleged that five members from the western-Sydney based movement have been killed whilst fighting in Syria and Iraq, with 'many more' still overseas as soldiers for the Islamic State.

Police allege Baryalei was the catalyst behind last Thursday's counter-terrorism raids that saw more than 800 police raid multiple homes in Sydney and Brisbane

A friend of the detained men claim they were only targeted by police because of their association with the Dawah group. 

'They're all good friends and a close-knit group,' a friend of the group told Sun Herald.

'But none of the guys are extreme or violent. They were raided because of their association with Baryalei and the Dawah group.'  

It's claimed that one of the group's former leaders is wanted terrorist Mohammad Ali Baryalei.

Baryalei was allegedly the ringleader behind a plot to execute a random Australian, which sparked counter-terrorism raids last Thursday.

The raids were insitgated when police allegedly intercepted a phone call from Baryalei to Sydney 22-year-old Omarjan Azari, which detailed the plot to execute a random Australian on camera.

Omarjan's brothers Samim and Waris were also detained during the raids but released without charge.  

Baryalei is captured in YouTube videos, undertaking his responsibilities with Parramatta Street Dawah group.  

There are reports almost half of the men detained during Sydney's terror raids were members of a Muslim street preaching group, led by wanted terrorist Mohammad Al Baryalei (pictured) 

He left Australia in April last year to the Turkey-Syria border, where he has been responsible for recruiting and moving around half of the 60 Australians fighting with terrorists groups in Syria and Iraq. 

Three other Parramatta Street Dawah preachers are amongst those who have died in the past two years in Syria in the war zone, as part of the fanatical ISIL militant movement.

The deceased Australians include Ahmad Moussalli, Sheik Mustapha al Majzoub, Yusuf Ali and Ali's wife Amira Karroum, 

When Sheik Mustapha al Majzoub died in Syria in August of 2012, the Street Dawah Australia Facebook page posted a tribute to the man they called 'Our Beloved Brother/Teacher.'

Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is now Australia's most senior Islamic State leader, worked as a spruiker outside a Kings Cross strip club before he turned to radical Islam

The Street Dawah movement has been coined 'a key breeding ground for radical young Sydneysiders'.

Since June 2012, the group has operated out of Parramatta as part of the international Street Dawah movement, 'spreading the blessing of Allah.'  

Police claim Baryalei is still a major influence on the Dawah members in Sydney. They are believed to have around 12 thousand supporters.

Mr El-Kadomi says the adherents at Parramatta Mosque respect what the police are doing, and will be happy to cooperate with authorities if they communicate more efficiently.

'The government and the police is not doing enough to come and talk to the community and explain what's going on,' said Mr El-Kadomi.

'We love to help the government.'     

Mr El-Kadomi of the Parramatta Mosque insists adherents at the Mosque are proud Australians, helping to build the country and respectful of the police operation.  

'Here, we are Muslim Australians. We are Australians as much as any other Australian,' said Mr El-Kadomi

'We love our country. We help in building Australia.

'We are a normal good citizen in Australia so we need everybody to respect us as much as we respect others.' 

Neighbours of Baryalei's mum told The Australian she had no idea her son was involved with militant groups until police raided their family home at Quakers Hill last December.

'She thought her son was over there studying,' the neighbour said. 

'After her house was raided, she said they must be mistaken, her son would never do anything wrong.'

Baryalei is believed to be currently in the Syrian city of Raqqa in a protected location, according to the newspaper. 

The Australian Federal Police have an arrest warrant out for Baryalei.

Baryalei, pictured with US-Australian citizen Tyler Casey (back) who was killed in Syria in January, is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians believed to be fighting for the Islamic State in the Middle East

Mohammad Ali Baryalei was featured in a number of YouTube videos attempting to convert random Australians to Islam. The picture on the right shows Baryalei playing a part in the TV series Underbelly
