A 57-year-old woman who owned 20 cats was mauled to death by two vicious neighborhood dogs outside her Ohio home on Friday morning.

Klonda Richey's lacerated body was found naked on snow-covered Bruce Avenue, Dayton about 8.15am, thrashed by her next door neighbors' male mixed breed Bullmastiffs.

Records have revealed Richey complained at least six times about the 60-pound canines before her horrific death, but authorities said they were never able to find the dogs.

Richey's next-door neighbors, 28-year-old Andrew 
Nason and 23-year-old Julie Custer, were taken into custody after the attack.

They are being 
held on a charge of reckless homicide, pending the filing of formal 
charges.

WDTN reported Custer, a Wright State University nursing graduate and mother, was the registered owner of the dogs.

The animals, which ripped off Richey's coat during the attack, were put down after they charged responding police officers on Friday.

The Montgomery County Coroner's Office said an autopsy was completed yesterday but the results will be released on Monday.

Richey's body is being held for further testing, according to Dayton Daily News.

'My right hand man!' Julie Custer, who was arrested over the death of her neighbor, posted a picture of this dog to her Facebook page in 2012

News of the shocking incident has devastated Richey's family and friends, who they described as a caring person who doted on her 20 cats.

She had worked at Montgomery County Job & Family Services Administration Services Division for 25 years.

'It's so ironic that this devout animal lover would be killed by animals in such a brutal aggressive way,' colleague Ann Stevens said.

'Every conversation I had with Klonda included cats - she was very passionate about animals and their well being and because of that she always had a special place in my heart.'

Richey was also an active Republican party volunteer, according to Dayton Daily News, and campaigned for Mitt Romney.

Rob Scott, former chairman of the Montgomery County Republican party, met Richey when he became chairman of the party in April 2012.

'She was always smiling and upbeat and positive, I never heard her say one negative thing about anyone,' he said.

'She always looked on the positive side of life.'

It is understood Richey lived alone in her clapboard home with her beloved cats.

In the wake of Friday's attack, Montgomery County Animal Control Resource Center officers removed her cats, which were well cared for.

They are reportedly being adopted by her friends.

In a troubling twist, it has been revealed that Richey complained to law enforcers about the dangerous dogs before she was fatally mauled.

A WTDN investigation showed in July of last year, Richey called 911 and told the dispatcher that two Bullmastiffs living at 35 East Bruce Avenue charged her. 

Police turned over the issue to Montgomery County’s Animal Resource Center.

ARC director Mark Kumpf said he was aware of nine complaints about the
 dogs responsible for the woman’s death.

'We have had previous complaints on the animals but we’ve never located them or seen them,' he said.

The six calls made by Richey mainly related to concerns about the dogs' barking: 'Dog is straining to get to water and food that are empty, advised is ongoing issue'.

'We are aware of additional complaints, unfortunately, the owners have never responded to any of our calls to the best of our knowledge. We are looking into this matter,' Kumpf said.
