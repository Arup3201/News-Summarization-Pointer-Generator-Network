Forget the fluffy handcuffs and the leather whips – it seems crocodile skin has taken on  a more raunchy role in the bedroom.

From paddles, human dog leashes to  ankle restraints and novelty back scratchers, the Soft Croc collection by Craig West is the latest fetish that’s got everyone talking from all walks of life.

The Darwin crocodile wrangler  has unleashed a range of handmade bondage gear made from saltwater crocodile, timber and metal that’s attracting buyers from across the globe.

The Soft Croc range includes handcuffs, paddles, 'spankers', whips, ankle and hand restraints and many more

Craig West is also a performer who runs his own shows for the who family - bringing out reptiles for everyone

‘I’m fully permitted and all my strictly-licensed products have come from a crocodile farm called Crocodylus Park – nothing has been taken from the wild,’ West told Daily Mail Australia.

'I'm a real conservationist and I've spent most of my years rescuing wildlife and saving injured or orphaned animals - you name it. 

‘I’ve been making crocodile-skin products for the past eight years but recently, I started to get sick of making the same stuff over and over.'

The idea came to light when a customer approached the 43-year-old and requested a ‘bondage whip’ to be made from the reptile's skin.

‘Someone asked me about making bondage products so I started designing and it pretty much took off from there,’ West said.

‘I started mucking around and showed people some of my creations that I was making and the word of mouth kicked off through friends and it just went crazy.

'It's surprising because I'm getting corporate people and people making the big decisions in life who are buying my stuff but it's all a bit of fun.'

It’s a fantasy world that West didn’t know existed but the full-time reptile performer said he has enjoyed being apart of the industry.

‘It’s all just a bit of amusement and to get a laugh out of it,’ West said. 

‘There have been so many bad things happening in the world these days and all you see is horror after another horror.

'Everyone who knows me knows that these products are not my scene but my range just so happened to work for everyone and I enjoy making them.

'It's the first in the world and its' unique range has hit the big markets all around the world – I’m getting exclusive distribution as far as Europe.

‘It’s definitely opened up to a lot of people’s eyes and I'm going to try and keep the creativity going.'

While West is keeping himself busy making handmade products as orders flow through, the Northern Territory man said he has been running his own shows for all ages the past few years.

'I also do a lot of charity work and entertainment for the children,' West said.

With his collection inspired after a number of visits to the sex stores and the internet, West said his high-quality products have been ‘road tested’ for everyone’s safety.

‘There have been no reports of complaints or serious injuries,’ West said.

‘It’s all just a bit of fun for people who want to spice things up in the bedroom.'

The Soft Croc range is available on Facebook now.
