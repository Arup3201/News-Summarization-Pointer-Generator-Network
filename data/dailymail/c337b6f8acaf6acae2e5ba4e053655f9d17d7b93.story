Labour's former election coordinator has admitted the party are having a ‘judder’ amid dismal poll ratings, and that some in the party ‘predict disaster’ for Ed Miliband.

Tom Watson MP pulled no punches about the mood of some in the party, on the same day as US guru David Axelrod addressed the shadow cabinet about how to sharpen up Labour’s campaign.

Mr Watson, writing on a Labour website, acknowledged the recent ‘struggles and difficulties’ but urged the party to pull together ahead of the local and European elections next week.

Behind
 David Axelrod's self-confessed 'tired and rumpled' appearance lies one of the sharpest political brains of his generation.

He
 won fame in the States after helping to convince Americans to pick 
their first black president in 2008 and then helped Barack Obama's 
re-election four years later.

But
the two Presidential triumphs are only the highest profile in a string of Democrat successes 
that have made the 59-year-old New Yorker a back room political superstar.

It began 30
 years ago when, fresh from quitting his job as the youngest political 
editor in the history of the Chicago Tribune, he helped oust a three-term Republican senator for Illinois.

Three
 years later, he was a key member of the team that helped re-elect Chicago's first black mayor Harold Washington.

But he has not been as successful in Europe as he was in the States.

Former Italian prime minister Mario Monti secured only 10.5% of the vote in Italy last year despite the guru's advice.

In a blog entitled ’10 reasons to be cheerful’ he reassured activists they could win over Ukip supporters, by telling them the party’s policy is a flat rate of tax for everyone from bankers to cleaners, and breaking up the NHS.

He added that Labour could win back seats from the Liberal Democrats, who he said were in ‘long term decline’ and had struggled to get candidates to stand, and that the party had to coax out the under-25 to vote, as 65 per cent of them back Labour.

Two polls today gave the party a small lead, after a disastrous week in which the Tories gained a lead in the polls for the first time in two years, and frontbenchers saying that Labour are bracing themselves for a minority government.

Mr Axelrod, credited with masterminding Barack Obama’s two election victories, and hired by Mr Miliband last month, watched Prime Minister’s Questions this week and is said to be advising him on how to improve his image.

He said when he was hired: 'I think candidates who can win are candidates who articulate a vision that speaks to the lives and concerns of the people they are running to represent.’

The strategist - known as ‘The Axe’ - gave a short speech to the shadow cabinet, telling them the cost of living message is the right one, but it has to resonate with middle class people.

He then held meetings with key frontbenchers including Harriet Harman and Ed Balls, and addressed party staff about campaigning techniques.

The shadow cabinet were told the 
squeeze on wages amid rising costs of food and housing is a ‘challenge 
for all western societies’ and affects people ‘right the way up the 
income scale’.

A Labour 
source said: ‘David Axelrod thinks victory for Ed Miliband would send a 
signal all around the world. He could make money elsewhere – he’s here 
because he thinks it’s an important message.’
