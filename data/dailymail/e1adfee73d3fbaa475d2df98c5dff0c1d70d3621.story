The ‘Big Six’ energy suppliers were accused of abusing their power yesterday and of inventing claims about rising wholesale costs.

MPs on the Commons energy select committee condemned recent price rises of around 10 per cent, which will add around £120 to annual bills.

And they hit out at the big bonuses paid to executives at a time when many customers are struggling with a choice between heating and eating.

Bosses from the Big Six claimed that they
 have been forced to put up their tariffs, at least partly, to reflect a
 rise in the wholesale cost of energy.

However, the head of a smaller energy 
company told MPs yesterday that this was not true and, in fact, 
wholesale prices have fallen in recent years.

Stephen
 Fitzpatrick, of Ovo Energy, said he could not understand the 
justification for the price rises being imposed by the big suppliers 
this winter.

‘I can’t explain any of these rises, other than they are not the prices we see in the liquid wholesale market,’ he said.

The
 Ovo chief said the wholesale price for gas peaked in the summer of 2011
 with a figure of 74p a therm to cover demand through the winter of 
2011-12.

Since then the 
figure for both last winter and this winter was a lower 72p per therm, 
while the forward price of gas to be supplied in 2014/15 is lower still 
at 69p.

The price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100 

The head of a small rival energy firm today accused the Big Six of pushing costs as high as possible, knowing many people will never switch suppliers.

Stephen Fitzpatrick, managing director of Ovo Energy, said he 'can't explain' the price rises being imposed because wholesale gas prices had fallen for his company.

His firm is now buying gas at a cheaper price than it had in 2009.

He said: 'It looks to me like a lot of energy companies, a significant number of the Big Six, are charging the maximum price they feel they can get away with to the customers that they feel will not switch under any circumstances and then maintaining the illusion of competitive pricing with tariffs targeted towards a very small number of relatively well-engaged customers.

He added: 'We buy all of our power and gas on the wholesale market.

'The most expensive price we have paid for wholesale gas in the last four years was in, I think, May 2011, that was 74p a therm.

'"Since then it has been below 72p a therm for this winter, last winter and next winter. We are buying gas for next winter at a current price of 69p a therm.

'So I can't explain any of these price rises, other than they are not the prices we see in the liquid wholesale market.'

He claimed that 
competition in the energy market has collapsed and that it is impossible
 to find out what the power giants are doing with all the money they are
 making.

Referring to the 
other energy company executives in the room, he said: ‘You will never 
find the money. These people are the best filibusterers in the business.

‘It
 looks to me like a lot of energy  companies, a significant number of 
the Big Six, are charging the maximum price they feel they can get away 
with to the customers that they feel will not switch under any 
circumstances.’

He told MPs
 that if all the customers of the Big Six switched supplier to his 
company they would have collectively saved £3.7billion in 2012.

MPs
 criticised the fact that most of the giant energy firms failed to send 
their chief executives to give evidence. The biggest supplier, British 
Gas/Centrica, as well as SSE, EDF, Npower and Scottish Power did not 
send their top man.

Labour 
MP Ian Lavery challenged the executives who did turn up, saying: ‘A 
report suggests over three million elderly people fear they will not be 
able to keep themselves warm over the winter.

‘Another
 says there is a potential for 24,000 people to die because of the hikes
 in the energy prices from your companies. It is an absolute outrage 
that this can happen in one of the richest countries in the world.

‘It is an absolute abuse, in my view, by the Big Six energy companies.’

The
 managing director of British Gas, Ian Peters, came under pressure to 
justify a culture of high pay and bonuses in the industry. MPs 
highlighted the example of Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, 
which owns British Gas.  They said his pay had risen 36 per cent since 
2008 to £2.35million.

Labour
 MP Albert Owen said: ‘How do you justify that? Do you think they have 
earned that  money? Do you think he deserves a 36 per cent increase when
 you  are putting up bills by almost 10 per cent?’

Mr
 Peters said: ‘Sam Laidlaw looks after a global group. A lot of growth 
in the Centrica profits, which post-tax are 5.9 per cent, has come from 
expansion overseas.

‘We are very aware of this issue and it is subject to an independent remuneration committee.’

He
 added: ‘We thought deeply about what to do with prices because of the 
impact on household bills at a time when incomes are stressed.

‘We do more than any other  company to help those in need.’

The
 energy companies told MPs outside forces were to blame for higher 
prices. These included  rising wholesale prices, green taxes, eco levies
 and charges to maintain and rebuild the national grid of wires and 
pipes.

Green: Tony Cocker (left), chief executive of E.ON, said green levies act as a 'regressive stealth tax essentially' and should be paid for from general taxation while Guy Johnson, External Affairs Director of RWE npower, also attacked the cost of the so-called climate obligation on power firms 

Anger: Labour MP Ian Lavery (left) accused the Big Six firms of 'absolute abuse' by pushing up bills while Tory MP Dr Phillip Lee said that with all the firms putting up prices they were effectively acting as a 'monopoly'

They argued for a 
radical shake-up in the way the country pays for the switch to green 
energy and to insulate the homes of the poor and vulnerable.

Currently, levies of around £135 are applied to all bills. However, the industry wants the cost shifted to general taxation.

Tony
 Cocker of Eon, who was the one chief executive who did turn up, 
described these charges as a ‘stealth poll tax’ which should be axed 
from bills.

He called for a full Competition Commission inquiry into the energy sector which, he believes, will clear firms of profiteering.

Mr
 Cocker added: ‘I fundamentally believe that this market is competitive 
but I acknowledge we are not trusted and therefore I believe we need to 
have a very thorough competition commission investigation.’
