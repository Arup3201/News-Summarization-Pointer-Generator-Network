A pizza shop robber was snared by police after they found a threatening note he had given to employees indented on toilet paper inside his home.

Eric Frey, 29, tried to rob Michael Maria's Pizza in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, on Saturday by handing an employee a note written on toilet paper that read: 'I have a gun. Give me $300.'

Police arrived before Frey could leave because an employee hit a panic button.

Eric Frey, 29, from Uniontown, Pennsylvania, was arrested and charged with the attempted robbery of a pizzeria after police found the message 'I have a gun. Give me $300' indented on a newly-opened toilet roll in his home 

The suspect told the employee and police that he was made to rob the store by another man who said he was going to shoot him if he didn't return with money.

But when police searched his apartment they found a newly-opened toilet paper with the message indented on another sheet.

They also found a black pen nearby matching the ink he used. 

According to the criminal complaint against Frey, a large bearded man standing in a nearby alleyway had coerced him into robbing the store.

When police turned up to search his home, he said: 'Let's go. I don't have anything to hide.'

Officers then found the toilet paper linking him to the crime. They then entered his kitchen and found a can of pop he had used to smoke marijuana, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune.  

Frey was charged with attempted robbery and robbery, attempted theft and theft, possession with attempt to deliver marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. 

He has four unrelated drug cases pending and was placed in the Fayette County Prison in lieu of $25,000 bond. 

Online court records don't list an attorney for Frey.

Officers also found a black pen next to the roll with the same ink used to write the threatening note 

Frey initially told employees outside Michael Maria's Pizza in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, that he was being told to rob the store by a man threatening to shoot him. But his story unraveled after police found the toilet roll
