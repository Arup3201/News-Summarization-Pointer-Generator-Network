With his valet pressed-trousers, highly polished brogues and artfully arranged pocket handkerchief, he is not the most obvious proponent of street style.

Still Prince Charles appeared to be  enjoying himself immensely as he hung around the streets of South London yesterday.

The heir to the throne was visiting the world-famous Oval, home of Surrey County Cricket Club, when he encountered a group of young people working with his charity, The Prince’s Trust.

The boisterous group, aged between 16 and 25, excitedly crowded around the future king and asked him to pose for a picture, and a laughing Charles was delighted to oblige.

He drew the line at their requests to throw a cool ‘street-style’ pose, preferring to fall back on that perennial royal favourite, jovially pointing his finger at the camera, instead.

One onlooker said: ‘The kids were boisterous but in great spirits and really excited to meet him, particularly as it was the prince himself who set up the charity they are currently involved in.

‘Prince Charles took it all in his stride and was delighted to join in with the fun. He was a hugely good sport and actually seemed to be really enjoying himself.’

Charles was visiting the Oval Cricket
Club, which is currently undergoing a £2 million redevelopment, as it 
is part of the Duchy of Cornwall’s portfolio of property interests.

Since 1337 the Duchy, which owns 
132,000 acres of land in 23 counties, has been the private domain of the
heir to the throne and last year provided him with an ‘income’ of £18.3
million to fund his public and private activities.

The Prince’s Trust has a centre on the
grounds and runs regular 12-week courses in conjunction with Lambeth 
College to offer young people who are unemployed and not in education 
the chance to develop skills and interests to get them back into either 
further education or the workplace.
