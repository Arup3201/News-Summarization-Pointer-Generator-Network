A California high school wrestling coach has been suspended after video emerged of him using wrestling moves as he subdued a male student in a classroom on Friday.

Mark Black had been teaching his science class when it allegedly came to his attention that the unnamed student had drugs in his possession.

A confrontation ensued and video shows what happened thereafter, but what seems like a case of a teacher going too far has some of Black's colleagues cheering him on.

Shocking? A shocking physical altercation between student and teacher was caught on a cell phone camera Friday

In a letter sent to parents by Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, Superintendent Sandra Lyon makes her stance that the well-regarded wrestling coach and teacher crossed a line.

'We really don't want teachers putting their hands on other students,' she wrote, calling the 'physical restraint' he used 'unaceptable.'

At the heart of the confrontation was the student's alleged marijuana possession.

'The little boy was selling drugs in class,' student Kylan Townsend told KTLA. 'The wrestling coach told him to stop...I guess he didn't listen and tables were thrown. They started fighting.'

There were no punches thrown, no kicking, and no yelling during the altercation.

However, Black was suspended even before an investigation was conducted.

These
 facts, paired with the student's alleged illegal activities have some 
area students, teachers and parents flocking to Black's side.

A
 petition called Reinstate Mark Black at Santa Monica High School has 
quickly appeared on Change.org with an accompanying Facebook page.

'Mark Black, longtime science teacher and wrestling coach at Santa Monica High School, was attacked on the morning of April 4, 2014,' reads the petition.

'Mr. Black, a wrestling coach with over 30 years experience, placed the student in a restraint hold to stop the student from further attacking him.  This was in an effort to get the situation under control,' it goes on to explain.

The Change.org page received nearly 2,000 isgnatures before the weekend was out and the Facebook page 'We support Coach Black of Samohi' had nearly 8,000 likes.

'Mark Black is an incredible man, coach, and mentor who has helped shape my son, and countless students, into incredible loving, responsible young adults,' wrote parent Tanja Elliott on the Change.org petition.

On Friday, Lyon wrote:

'As a parent, I know that we want our children to be safe at school. This is a fundamental expectation that I honor and respect. I am committed to ensure that any disciplinary action taken in this matter is based on facts, the law and all studentsâ€™ right to a safe learning environment.'

No punches were thrown, nor was there any kicking or yelling during the incident which got Black suspended before an investigation could take place
