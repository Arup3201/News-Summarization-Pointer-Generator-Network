Kidulthood actor Adam Deacon missed a court date after being sectioned under the Mental Health Act

Bafta-award winning Kidulthood actor Adam Deacon has missed a court date after being sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

The actor and director was due to appear in court today after he was charged with affray and possession of a long-bladed sword near his home in east London, but was too unwell to attend a hearing.

Police were called on the evening of January 6 to reports of a man armed with a 'machete'-style knife who was said to be threatening members of the public in Bethnal Green.

Deacon, who shot to fame in the gritty film Kidulthood, did not appear at Thames Magistrates Court this morning because he was too unwell after being sectioned under the Mental Health Act, the court heard.

The court clerk said: 'This case was adjourned, I believe, on the 6th March and if you look at the charge sheet, the charges concern allegations from January 6 of affray and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place.

'On the last occasion the defendant wasn't in court and an adjournment period was agreed because the defendant was in hospital for treatment for underlying mental health issues.'

Emek Yagmur, defending Deacon, passed a letter from the hospital the actor is receiving treatment at to the court .

She said: 'He is now back in their care and he has not been released because he is not well enough to attend. He has been sectioned under section two [of the mental health act].

'We are asking for a six-week adjournment. He is clearly not very well.' 

The hearing, which lasted a matter of minutes, was adjourned to April 30.

The panel said it wanted to see medical reports when the troubled actor, 32, next appears.

Deacon, who won a Bafta rising star award for directing urban comedy Anuvahood, is also due to stand trial at Hammersmith Magistrates Court on May 11, accused of harassing fellow actor Noel Clarke on social media.

Deacon was arrested back in January after failing to appear in court to face the harassment charge.
