When Lisa Epsom broke her tooth opening her son's juice bottle, she thought it would just require a quick trip to the dentist.

In fact, it led to her losing half her face after the dentist discovered mouth cancer which was so advanced, she was just weeks from death.

After a 14-hour operation to remove the tumour, she said: 'That Fruit Shoot bottle saved my life. 

'Had I not opened it with my teeth, I would not be here.

'I've lost my looks and feel disfigured. People stare at me in the street but I'm alive and I can watch my kids grow up, so it's a small price to pay.

'Now I want others to be more aware of mouth cancer - because I had never even heard of it.'

Lisa Epsom, 34 (left, before falling ill), was horrified to learn she was just weeks from death with a rare form of mouth cancer. She had only been diagnosed after breaking her tooth opening a bottle of Fruit Shoot and her dentist noticing a growth inside her mouth. She has since undergone surgery to cut the tumour from her face

Upon being diagnosed with cancer, Ms Epsom underwent tests to see how far the cancer had spread. She was devastated to learn she would need immediate surgery to remove a golf ball sized tumour under her nose and cheek

Her problems began in September 2013 while at home with her baby daughter Tiffany and young son Maison.

Ms Lisa, 34, recalls: 'I opened a bottle of juice with my teeth and when I felt one break,  I could have kicked myself for being so silly.

'I was cross with myself because my teeth had been weak since my last pregnancy. I spat the tooth into the sink and made an appointment to see the dentist in three weeks' time.'

But when the dentist examined her teeth, he seemed more concerned about a red patch on the roof of her mouth and gave her a mirror to look at it.

She says: 'Right away, alarm bells began ringing in my head. I'd spotted it about a year before but a GP said it was nothing to worry about. 

'Now I could see it was bigger, about the size of a 5p coin, with veins coming out of it.'

The dentist arranged a test and Ms Epsom feared the worst.

'I had a bad feeling and just knew it was cancer. I had smoked when I was younger,' she said.

The following week she went to hospital for a biopsy and, five days later, she was told the result.

She says: 'The consultant's face said it all - it was cancerous.

During the operation surgeons removed most of Ms Epsom's cheekbone and palate, then used tissue from her thigh (right) to rebuild her face. She said: 'When I woke up I felt like I'd been in the boxing ring'

'He said I could be dead within weeks. The first thing I thought about was my kids and who would look after them if I died. I was only 33 at the time.'

Ms Epsom, of Abbey Wood, South East London, was told she had adenoid cystic carcinoma of the hard palate, a rare form of mouth cancer requiring urgent treatment.

Mouth cancer, also known as oral cancer, is where a tumour develops on the surface of the tongue, mouth, lips or gums.

Tumours can also occur in the salivary glands, tonsils and the pharynx (the part of the throat from your mouth to your windpipe) but these are less common.

Symptoms of mouth cancer include:

* red or white patches on the lining of your mouth or tongue

* ulcers

* a lump

See your GP if these symptoms do not heal within three weeks, especially if you are (or were) a heavy drinker or smoker.

The single mother of four and son from a later relationship who live with her — says: 'After the doctor told me it was cancer, I went home and went through all the motions, giving my two younger children their tea, bathing them and reading their bedtime story.

'But inside I felt like a robot. All I could think about was not being alive to do these things with them.

'My two older kids needed me too, so I knew I had to be strong.

As well as being mother to Maison, six and Tiffany, two, Ms Epsom, a single mother, has two older children, Sarah, 14, and Natasha, 12, who live with their father.

She said: 'Dying just wasn't an option for me. One of the consultants even joked that chipping my tooth wasn't so unlucky after all.'

CT and MRI scans were arranged to see how far the cancer had spread - and there was bad news when a biopsy through her revealed a golf ball sized tumour under her nose and cheek. 

Ms Epsom was horrifed to be told that had she gone another six to eight weeks without treatment, she would have died. 

She said: 'I had no idea I had been so close to death. It was so shocking because I'd felt so well.'

Two weeks later, in December 2013, she underwent major surgery.

She said: 'I had no idea I had been so close to death. It was so shocking because I'd felt so well'

'I kissed the kids goodbye with tears in my eyes. I was petrified that I might not see them again. 

'I looked at their gorgeous faces and made my Mum promise to be there for them if anything happened to me.'

During the operation surgeons removed most of Ms Epsom's cheekbone and palate, then used tissue from her thigh to rebuild her face.

She said: 'When I woke up I felt like I'd been in the boxing ring. My whole face throbbed with pain.

'I asked for a mirror straight away and the nurses hesitated but I needed to know how I looked.

'I'd been warned I would look different but nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. I did't recognise myself.

'I gasped and broke down in tears - I thought I looked like a monster.

'My face was so swollen and disfigured. I just didn't look like me any more.'

As a result, it was three weeks before she allowed her two younger children to visit her in hospital.

She said:  'My mum tried to prepare them by showing them photographs of how I looked, but it was still a huge shock for them.

'Tiffany was terrified and hid from me. That broke my heart — she was scared of her own mummy.

'Maison asked if my face would ever go back to normal and I had to explain that even though I looked different on the outside, I would still be the same mummy on the inside.

'He just shrugged and said "I know" and jumped on to my lap for a cuddle.'

Ms Epsom (pictured before surgery) says she now avoids looking in the mirror. 'My confidence has gone but it's a small price to pay. I'm learning to live again and I'm alive, and that's more important than anything'

Eventually Tiffany got used to her mother's new appearance.

Ms Epsom said: 'I can't pretend it didn't bother me, but if I had to choose between my looks and watching my kids grow up, there really is no contest.'

She left hospital a month after her operation, though she still had to have six weeks of radiotherapy, from January to March 2014.

And because the surgery had made it difficult to eat, she lost 4st, shrinking from a size 12 to a tiny size 4 and ending up being tube-fed. But, finally, in July last year, scans showed she was cancer-free.

Now, eight months on, she has started going out in public again, but says people's stares are hard to cope with. She also avoids looking in the mirror.

Lisa says: 'My confidence has gone but it's a small price to pay. I'm learning to live again and I'm alive, and that's more important than anything.

'I've learned so much about what's important and that I have amazing family and friends who have supported me every step of the way.

'I also know it's vital to visit the dentist regularly. Mine saved my life.'
