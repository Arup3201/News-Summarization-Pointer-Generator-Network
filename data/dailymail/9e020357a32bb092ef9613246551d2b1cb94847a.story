They are the breathtaking photos that reveal the true beauty of Scotland's varied landscapes.

From the Edinburgh skylines to the dramatic Highlands and the rugged beauty of the western islands, photographers have submitted their most captivating images for a competition focusing on the beauty of Scotland.

Autumn colours at Leachachan Larch on the Isle of Skye show the island bathed in a golden glow, while the first snow in Lochinver in Sutherland, shows the Highlands in winter.

The images have been submitted for the annual Lovers of Light photography competition, which has received more than 3,000 entries since it opened a month ago.

And for those who prefer to snap pictures with their phone, a new part of the competition is available, allowing user to submit their best Instagram photo to win a holiday to New York.

Last year's challenge attracted nearly 15,000 breathtaking entries with amateur photographer, Graham Colling, taking top prize. 

The winning entrant from the main category will enjoy a summer of endless daylight in northern Finland, which Colling described as 'an experience never to be forgotten.' 

Images must be submitted by February 20 2015 to be considered.
