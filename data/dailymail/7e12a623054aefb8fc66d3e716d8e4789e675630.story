Global sales for fast food giant McDonald's have slumped to a 10-year record low with Australia singled out as a 'weak' market.

Internationally, Australia is part of the worst performing sector for this year's second quarter, the Asia Pacific Middle East and Africa operation, where sales fell by a massive 7.3 per cent.

McDonald's chief executive Don Thompson defined under performing Australian and Japanese markets as weak and said the Illinois-based company was concentrating on 'stabilising' key priority markets in both Australia and Japan, as well as Germany and the U.S., reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

On the back of the slump, a McDonald's Australia spokesperson said the Australian business was strong and growing despite a 'challenging environment'.

But as consumers look for healthier options in an increasingly competitive market, McDonald's recorded its worst global results in a decade with a 2.5 per cent drop in June and July.

The results are its weakest since 2003 when the chain posted a 3.7 per cent fall over consecutive months.

McDonald's has faced increase scrutiny in Australia in recent months thanks to the rollout of its controversial home delivery service already available in areas across Sydney's west including North Parramatta and Waterloo and Stanmore in the city's inner suburbs.

The move is part of the fast food chain's strategy to 'stablise' the Australian market by increasing sales, but the service has been slammed by health groups concerned about easier access to junk food.

Areas in Melbourne and Hervey Bay in Queensland's south east are trialling the service this month.

The Hervey Bay trial has come under particular attack due to the area's already extremely overweight population where two thirds of adults are overweight or obese and one quarter of children are also overweight or obese, reported the ABC.

Queensland's Australian Medical Association president Dr Shaun Rudd said the service could compound the problem of obesity.

'It's pretty sad. These large corporations have a look where they're going to get the most bang for their buck and they choose places like that,' he said.

'I think unfortunately they'll sell more food and that means there's going to be more burgers and more fries eaten by the population there, and they are already extremely overweight.'

Yet McDonald's has already hailed the service a success and confirmed its plans to continue expanding it throughout the country once trials are finished.

McDonald's and other fast food chains have also faced further criticism after a Cancer Council study found they were advertising higher-calorie adults meals to children by using an advertising code loophole.

The company slump has been intensified in the U.S. due to increases competition from other chains offering limited menus

The study found McDonald’s Chicken 'n' Cheese Burger and KFC's Mint Choc Krusher were some of the adult meals shown to children.

Internationally the company sparked food safety concerns with reports workers at a Shanghai plant were repackaging expired meat.

The fast food chain promptly stopped using supplies from the plant, which meant many Asian stores could not serve Big Mac and Chicken McNuggets.

McDonalds was also ordered to pay $27 million in damages in July due to relaxed security in a Texas store leading to the death of two teenagers in 2012.

Denton Ward, 18, was bashed to death in the store and his 18-year-old partner Lauren Crisp was killed when she crashed her car while trying to get him to hospital.

Despite the slump in McDonald's global sales, Burger King Worldwide has recorded its third consecutive sales growth in Canada and the U.S.

Yet with more than 35,600 restaurants internationally and with 19 per cent owned by McDonald's, the fast food giant plans to franchise 1,500 of its company-owned stores mainly outside the U.S. by 2016.

In the U.S. there has also been move from consumers to chains offering limited menus over McDonald's all in one approach.

The company's shares fell 21 cents to $US93.10 at the close of trade on Wall Street on Friday.
