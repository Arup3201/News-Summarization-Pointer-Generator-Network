One cook has turned his kitchen into his studio, creating artworks with a breakfast serving of pancakes.

What started as simple shapes made from pancake batter to amuse his children has turned into three-dimensional sculptures and replicas of famous artworks.

Michael Goudeau spends hours creating edible art, sharing photographs of his pancake masterpieces on his blog before it is gobbled up for breakfast in what he calls his ‘madness’.

That's pancake batter: Cook Michael Goudeau started making letters out of pancake batter to amuse his children but now spends hours creating amazing replicas like this plate of tacos, steak, chips and salad

On his blog The Pancake Project, the 53-year-old calls himself a 'pancake artist' and that 'the time has come to reveal my madness'.

Breakfast never looked so artistic, with pancake batter whipped into replicas of other foods such as tacos, steak and chips, Christmas trees or a mouse caught in a trap complete with red syrup to show his sticky end.

Artist Edvard Munch would surely be licking his lips had he seen Mr Goudeau’s attempt to recreate his famous painting The Scream.

Intricate eating: Mr Goudeau uses a bottle with nozzle to create intricate designs such as this mouse caught in a mousetrap complete with red syrup to show his sticky end

Mr Goudeau, a professional juggler from Las Vegas, Nevada said: ‘I make pancakes for breakfast for my children Emily, 10, and Joey, 12.

‘This started when they were very young. I wanted to make something that would get them excited about eating so I made the first letter of each of their names.

‘They loved them and their excitement led me to up my game.’

Three dimensional breakfast: The 'next step into crazy' was three dimensional animals, Mr Goudeau said. He used a breakfast sausage to thread several pancakes together to create a pig (right)

The pancake artist uses a bottle with a nozzle to pipe intricate sections and adjusts the cooking heat to control the colour and texture of the batter.

He said: ‘I put the batter into a squeeze bottle, and I found I could do letters and easy shapes and designs.

‘For the first couple of years I only worked with getting different tones of brown by timing the placement of different parts of the batter.

Syrup for slime: This pancake snail left a trail of slime (syrup) on the breakfast plate

Amusing breakfast: Mr Goudeau started with letters to get his children Joey, 12, and Emily (pictured), 10, excited about eating

‘The next step into crazy was the idea that I could make a three dimensional pancake.

‘I made a pig's face, several regular pancakes and a pig's butt and threaded them all onto a breakfast sausage and put the whole thing into a pool of syrup.

‘That lead to the 3D snail with a syrup trail all the way across the table and then into a new technique of stacking different pancake pieces to build something complex.

Favourite food: Once he discovered that pancake batter takes on food colouring really well to make vibrant colours, Mr Goudeau extended his creations to trees. His favourite is the Christmas tree (right)

Mr Goudeau then experimented with food colouring, using it to recreate almost real looking replicas.

He said: ‘My next discovery was how well pancake batter accepts food colouring, if you put in a lot of it you get very vibrant colours.

‘I made a colour wheel to demonstrate this but my favourite version of these is the Christmas tree.

‘It combines the simple stacking with the bright colours and makes what I think is a beautiful and very simple pancake.’
