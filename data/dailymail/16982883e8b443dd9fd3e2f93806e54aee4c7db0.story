Bernie Madoff is said to be in an ‘alternate reality’ where he does not feel he is to blame for losing more than $50billion of other people's money.

A reporter claimed the former Wall St titan believes he is as much a victim as the thousands of people who lost their life savings in his Ponzi scheme.

The fraudster, serving a 150 year prison sentence, is also considering his first TV interview from behind bars, said Fox reporter Charlie Gasparino.

Convicted: Fraudster Bernie Madoff is said to be in an 'alternate reality' where he does not feel he is to blame for losing over $50billion of other people's money

The Today show is said to have filmed at the Butner, North Carolina, prison where Madoff is serving his sentence.

Madoff admitted to reporter Charlie Gasparino that he is considering his first sit down TV interview to give his side of the story.

He said he had made one commitment to a network and an interview could be ‘weeks away.’

Mr Gasparino revealed the prospect of the interview following a series of telephone and email conversations with the fraudster.

He said Madoff sounded on the phone like a kindly uncle rather than a master criminal.

‘His voice is the most amazing, soothing voice,’ Mr Gasparino told ‘Good Morning America’

‘You really feel like you're talking to your uncle, your nice, rich uncle who's a nice guy and, you know, you don't feel like you're talking to an arch-criminal.’

Mr Gasparino, a reporter for the Fox Business Network, said Madoff tried to claim he was as much victim as those he swindled out of an estimated $50billion.

‘His side of the story was pretty simple,’ Mr Gasparino said.

‘It's: “Listen, I was kind of victimised too. You know, I was part of a racket, which is Wall Street. And by the way, my clients all knew I was ripping people off.

‘“They were forcing me to do this because they had such high expectations. So I'm kind of a victim too.”’

Mr Gasparino said Madoff, 73, was delusional and creating an ‘alternate reality’ where he was not to blame.

He said Madoff told him he was ‘trapped into the greed of others,’ such as his large clients who demanded high returns and looked away from obvious red flags about year-after-year high returns.

‘I made a terrible mistake with the help 
of others but the fact that these other complicit parties were complicit
 does not excuse me for allowing myself to be trapped into the greed of 
others,’ he wrote in one his emails.

'He's a pathological liar. There is no doubt about that. His
 aim right now is to sort of create an alternative reality for himself 
and for the general public to think: “He wasn't such a bad guy”'

‘The only reason my LARGE investors continued to give me money was they all believed that I was front running (illegally trading ahead of customers) like everyone else and they felt this explained my consistent performance.’

Mr Gasparino added: ‘He's a pathological liar. There is no doubt about that. His aim right now is not to help regulators find out exactly where (Wall) Street is wrong.

‘His aim right now is to sort of create an alternative reality for himself and for the general public to think: “He wasn't such a bad guy”.’

Madoff has been ostracised by his family with his wife Ruth refusing to visit him in an attempt to re-establish her relationship with her son Andrew following the suicide of her other son Mark.
