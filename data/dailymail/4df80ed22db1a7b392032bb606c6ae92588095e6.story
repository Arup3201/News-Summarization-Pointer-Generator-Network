The man accused of murdering April Jones today claimed he could not remember what he did with the five-year-old’s body because he is a ‘registered alcoholic’.

Mark Bridger, 47, told police he drank up to 20 pints and half a bottle of vodka every day - and claims he was drunk at the wheel of his Land Rover when he ran over April while she played on her bike.

Bridger sobbed in the dock at Mold Crown Court as his interview with police was played to the jury.

Evidence: A general view of Mark Bridger's blue Land Rover Discovery, in Mold, north Wales, as the jury today viewed the car belonging to him and the bike that was being ridden by schoolgirl April Jones

Cycle: A bike belonging to April Jones' friend - who cannot be named due to legal reasons - in Mold, north Wales

The jury also today viewed a car 
belonging to Bridger and the bike ridden by April, who had cerebral 
palsy, on the night she went missing near her home in Machynlleth, 
mid-Wales, last October.

Bridger
denies abducting and murdering the schoolgirl in a ‘sexually motivated’
attack. But the prosecution say Bridger, a former slaughterhouse 
worker, snatched and murdered the schoolgirl.

He
said he accidentally killed her when he ran her over and accepts that 
he must have got rid of her body but cannot remember how it did it 
because he was drunk.

Today 
the jury was taken to view both Bridger’s left-hand drive blue Land 
Rover Discovery and April’s pink bicycle. The media were later granted 
access to the vehicles to take photographs.

Stickers
were left across the car identifying points of examination and the 
driver’s seat was covered by plastic. Signs saying Chemical Substance 
Warning were on the windscreen and back window.

Earlier
this week the jury heard from a forensic scientist who said he could 
find no evidence of a collision either on the Land Rover or on the 
child’s bike.

April’s body was never found despite the biggest search operation in British policing history.

The court also heard that Bridger used
to work for Randall Parker Foods in Llanidloes, which is about 17 miles
from Machynlleth, between October 2009 and January 2010.

A
statement read from his former colleague Gage Talbot said: ‘Mark 
Bridger’s employment in the abattoir would have allowed him access to an
array of knives and he was skilled at boning and skinning knives.’

The
court also heard that Bridger started working as a firefighter for the 
London Fire Brigade in May 1984 but resigned in November the same year. 
He was living in south Croydon, Surrey, at the time.

A
statement was also read from Staff Sgt Luke Jones who had checked armed
forces records for any evidence that Bridger had served, as he claimed 
to have done in his police interviews.

Nobody going by the name Mark Leonard Bridger has ever served in the UK regular or reserve forces, the court heard.

The jury was shown footage of the moment Bridger was booked in at Aberystwyth police station. The film shows him being searched and having his shoes and jacket removed.

The arresting officer tells him he has been arrested on suspicion of abduction. Paul Hobson, for the prosecution, read out Bridger’s first interviews with the police.

In a statement, Pc Jules Evans said she asked the defendant if he had served in the armed forces. He told the officer that he had ‘worked as a mercenary in Angola and he had been to Belize’.

He said he had been ‘trained by an SAS unit in Burma’. He said he had been ‘seconded’ to the British Army but that he was not registered to it and that he had been doing this for the past nine years.

The jury heard previously that April and her best friend had been cycling near their homes on Machynlleth’s Bryn-Y-Gog estate when she disappeared.

The pair had swapped bikes and April had been riding her friend’s bicycle shortly before she was last seen.

Mr Hobson then read the interviews with Det Con Louise Thomas who read her part of the first ‘urgent interview’ which was carried out shortly after his arrest while Mr Hobson read Bridger’s replies to the court.

During the interview, which took place at 6:18pm on October 2, Bridger said: ‘I don’t know where she is.’

He said he had split up with his girlfriend and then been to his daughter’s parents’ evening at Machynlleth Junior School when he began drinking.

He said: ‘I am a registered alcoholic. I drink 15 to 20 pints a day and a bottle of vodka a day and through the night.’

During a long statement Bridger went on to say how he drove over April, put her in his car, tried to giver her mouth to mouth, and then panicked and starting driving around getting increasingly drunk.

He told the officer: ‘I had obviously crushed her little body.’

During the statement Bridger, wearing a short-sleeved light blue shirt and tie, broke down and wept in the dock.

He told Det Con Thomas that ‘adrenaline was pumping and the alcohol inside me was pumping’.

He said at some point he stopped the car and that ‘he knew there was no life in her’. Bridger said that he ‘slapped her’ and did ‘all the things that go through your head.’

‘All this time I am thinking, ‘what have I done’’ and then took some more mouthfuls of vodka’.

He then described being back at his home and not knowing how he had got there. Bridger then told the officer he began frantically searching his property for the child.

He said: ‘I would not have dumped her. I just don’t know where I have put her. I am sorry, I don’t know.’

Later he told the officer: ‘Due to this incident I have difficulty looking female police officers in the eye. A dad is a dad but a mother gives birth. I am surprised you spoke to me so politely.’

In his second interview on the morning of October 3, Bridger told police that he had spent the previous night in custody without sleep because he was ‘going over events in his head to jog a memory’.

But he said he still had no recollection of where he put April’s body.

'I would not have buried her, but obviously it was raining and I would have covered her out of respect'

He added: ‘I don’t believe in myself that I would have dumped her. I would have put her where she would be found.

‘I would not have buried her, but obviously it was raining and I would have covered her out of respect.’

He said he remembered driving around Machynlleth with April’s body and seeing men in fluorescent jackets who he believed to be railway workers.

‘I knew the seriousness of things, but I hadn’t realised people had been called out for a missing girl,’ he added.

As the evidence was read out to the jury, Bridger, wearing a blue short sleeved shirt and blue tie, used a handkerchief to wipe tears from his eyes.

Asked why he went to the Bryn-y-Gog estate that night, he said he wanted to see his ex-partner who lived there.

He said he was ‘reminiscing about the relationship’ and added: ‘I just wanted to see my ex and I sat there and drank an amount of cider. I was quite emotional.’

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
