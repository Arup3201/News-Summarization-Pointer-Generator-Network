Models in wheelchairs and the world's first male amputee to hit the catwalk were among those taking to the runway at New York Fashion Week.

The FTL Moda's AW15 show, which featured international designers with a 'Made in Italy' theme, showcased models from all over the world alongside some of the industry's most esteemed clothes horses.

Named FTL Moda Loving You, the show was held in collaboration with Fondazione Vertical - an Italian foundation supporting research to find a cure for spinal cord injuries.

London-based Models of Diversity, an agency that campaigns for greater diversity of modelling talent in the media and on the catwalk, was also involved. 

It comes after American Horror Story actress Jamie Brewer became the first woman with Down syndrome to walk the runway last Thursday, as she strutted the catwalk in Carrie Hammer’s show. 

British personal trainer Jack Eyers became the first male amputee model to strut his stuff on the catwalk in the show.

Jack, from Bournemouth, Dorset, was handpicked by celeb fashion designer, Antonio Urzi, whose creations have been worn by the likes of Beyoncé and Lady Gaga.

He became an amputee at the age of 16, after having his right leg, which had been left withered by a condition called Proximal Femoral Focal Deficiency, amputated.

Speaking ahead of his runway appearance, he said: 'It all feels so surreal. I can’t believe this is actually happening. To be the first male amputee model on a New York Fashion Week runway feels amazing - it feels like such a big deal.

The show's producer said they wanted to show that disability is very often just a mental state by inviting disabled models onto the runway next to some of the best models on the scene

'I have no idea what to expect, so it’s pretty overwhelming,' he continued. 'I just want to show that having a disability doesn’t need to hold you back.' 

Antonio Urzi is best known for creating some of the quirky costumes worn by Lady Gaga - including the silver sequined creation she wore on her 28th birthday last year. 

The designer to the stars has also had his pieces worn by the likes of Beyoncé and Britney Spears.

Jack said: ‘It's amazing to think I'll be wearing clothes designed by such a prestigious man - I'm in good company.

‘I always said if I was going to do something like this, I want to do it big.

‘I want people to see me, and to realise that there needs to be more disabled models walking the runway.’

Speaking about the show, producer Ilaria Niccolini told Ticker Report: 'It is a very significant moment in my fashion career, this opportunity to finally open the most recognised runways in the world [Mercedes Benz Fashion Week New York now, and in Milan Fashion Week in two weeks] to these beautiful talents, ready to show that disability is very often just a mental state by performing on the runway next to some of the best models on the scene.

'Working with Fabrizio Bartoccioni at Vertical Foundation has been a thoughtful and extremely motivating experience, that opened my mind completely and showed me that the wheelchairs or prosthetics are not more than "accessories", extensions of the dress, as Fabrizio often says.'
