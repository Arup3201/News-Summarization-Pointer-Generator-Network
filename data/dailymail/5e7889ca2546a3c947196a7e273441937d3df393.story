Bethany Cammack took home the crown of Miss Teen Galaxy England in March this year

A beauty queen who suffered years of torment for being too good looking has had the last laugh by taking home a national title.

Bethany Cammack, 18, saw her first victory at the young age of 14 when she won her first prize at a local competition.

But rather than receiving congratulations from her peers Bethany, from St Helens, Merseyside was subjected to vicious name-calling and trolling on social media sites from other jealous pupils.

The college student became so down-trodden by the constant abuse that she came close to giving up on competing completely.

Bethany says that the bullying started early and as she was met with more success the abuse only worsened.

She explains: 'I was only 14-years-old when I did my first event and I won. But when I started doing more and more modelling and events the bullying got worse.

'It started off with sly name calling in school but over time it turned much worse - things were being posted about me on social media.'

Bethany says her bullies tried to justify their behaviour by claiming that she thought herself superior to everyone. 

'People would say that I thought I was better than them just because I was competing as a beauty queen.

'Even people that were my best friends would call me names and things like that. The bigger the event I did, the worse the bullying got.

'I was called a sl** a b**** and all sorts of other things - it was the most upsetting things you could imagine.'

Bethany says that the torment became endless with her abusers able to attack her both at home and in school.

'There's nothing worse than seeing people saying such horrible things about you online and then giving you abuse the next day in school - it was horrific.

'I considered giving it up because it was leaving me in tears - people who I thought were my friends turned their backs on me all because I was doing something I loved.

'But I did more and more events and started growing in confidence - I realised that I shouldn't let bullies have their own way.

'It started spurring me on to do better and I know that I'm better off than they are now - I'm so glad I stuck with it.'

The determined student this year was able to overcome her demons and hit-back at her bullies after she was crowned Miss Teen Galaxy England in March. 

Bethany had almost given up on her pageanting dream after she faced years of torment for being too good looking

Bethany, who studies hair and media make-up at St Helens college, was first scouted while shopping in London and romped to victory in her maiden event, Miss Teen Queen 2010.

She started commercial modelling a year later and has travelled to the US to do a range of photo-shoots on several occasions. 

Although Bethany had enjoyed much success up to this point her win at Miss Teen Galaxy England meant the most to the 18-year-old as it not only helped her get over years of torment but also saw the launch of international opportunities.

The win earned her a place at the Miss Teen Galaxy International event in Orlando in the summer where she competed over four days for the prestigious title.

She missed out on the top-spot but said she has been offered the chance to return to the US for more modelling shoots in the future.

Bethany says that she would face her bullies in school and then come home only for the abuse to continue online via social networking sites

Bethany's dreams came true when she took home first prize at The Miss Teen Galaxy England awards (pictured) earning her a place in The Miss Teen Galaxy International event in Orlando in the summer 

Bethany says that although she didn't win the crown she really enjoyed competing and gained a lot of experience.

'The standard was incredibly high over there and unfortunately I didn't win but it was a phenomenal experience.

'We did photo shoots and all sorts of things - I've even been offered to go back and do some more modelling which is something I'm seriously considering.

'I'm in my final year at college and I'm still deciding whether or not to go to university so we'll see what happens.'

Bethany, who is now an ambassador for charity Bullies Out, is determined to share her experiences with other victims of online bullying. 

Although Bethany did not take home the crown at the Orlando awards, she says she was thrilled to have taken part

'It's great to be able to have all of these things on my CV after everything that happened - all I want to do now is help other people.

'As an ambassador for the Bullies Out charity, I travel to schools in St Helens and give talks to people about bullying.

'It's great to share my experiences and hopefully help others who are suffering the same thing.'

Bethany hopes that her story can prove that it is possible to do what you love no matter what others think. 

'I want to show people that you don't have to put up with bullies - you should always stick to your guns and do what you want to do.

'It's very hard at times but you'll always have the last laugh.'
