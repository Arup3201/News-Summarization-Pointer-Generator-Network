A 13-year-old Northeast Texas boy has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for killing his 12-year-old biological brother and their adoptive father.

The boy, from Cass County, whose name has not been released because of his age, shot both family members.

He pleaded guilty at a January 9 hearing to two counts of capital murder according to Cass County District Attorney Randal Lee.

The case dates back to last summer, and is described by Lee as: 'pretty cold-blooded', and 'right up there with some of the adult murders I've seen', The Longview News-Journal reported. 

The teen will remain in juvenile custody until he's 19, when he'll be transferred to an adult prison.

Cass County Sheriff Larry Rowe said he was satisfied with the guilty plea.

However, he added that local law enforcement struggle to understand laws that could allow the boy out of prison much earlier than an adult who committed the same crime.

A plea bargain lowered the sentencing to 25 years from a maximum of 40 years.

Members of the teen's family are reportedly on board with the deal and gave victim impact statements at the January 9 hearing.

Many in the small town are questioning what an appropriate punishment is for such a horrific crime.

'We don't understand in law enforcement why someone 13 years old can do that and possibly be out of jail by the time they're 30,' Rowe told the Longview News-Journal.

The plea bargain was worked out before District Attorney Lee took office on January 1, 2015.

Police were first called to the victims' home near Hughes Springs at 10:42 p.m. on June 27, 2014, after a 911 call by the 13-year-old.

They found two bodies – 32-year-old Damon Robison, and his adopted 12-year-old son – who were found with gunshot wounds near the kitchen of the property.

Police found a semiautomatic pistol at the scene.

There were no signs of a break-in and nothing appeared to be missing. The 13-year-old boy was reported to be uninjured.

The adoptive mother of the two boys, Donna Robison, their biological grandmother, was away at work at the time of the shooting. 

Her husband was a mechanic at Pittsburg Tractor. The boys' birth mother is named as Sarah Curto of Naples, Texas.

At the time officials were unclear as to what the circumstances were that had led to the shooting.

The surviving boy was detained for questioning, but released.

He was rearrested on October 1 after police located witnesses who told them that he had admitted to the killings.

Immediately after the two murders the teen reportedly tried to manipulate the crime scene by cutting his own arm with a knife and then placing the knife in his adoptive father's hand, said Lee.

The teen then told police that Robison attacked him and his brother, and that he shot Robison while defending himself. 

Prosecutors say the teen had planned to only kill his father, but his brother walked in, and he killed him too.

Given the boy's age, Lee found the two murders as disturbing in their calculation and premeditation as anything he had seen in his legal career.

'It’s just horrendous,' he said.
