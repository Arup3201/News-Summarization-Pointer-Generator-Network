Ghana’s Kevin-Prince Boateng says he and team-mate Sulley Muntari were sent home from the World Cup squad after coach Kwesi Appiah hurled insults and told him to 'f*** off'.

Boateng claims Appiah sent the pair to the dressing room after the manager caught them laughing during a one-on-one exercise, and shouted at the Schalke midfielder behind closed doors.

It goes against the Ghanaian FA's statement which said the decision to send Boateng home was because of 'vulgar insults targeted at coach Kwesi Appiah during the team's training session'.

'There was an incident at practice yesterday,' Boateng told SportBild.

'Sulley Muntari and I were joking around after a one-on-one. We both started laughing. The coach immediately stopped practice and asked why we were laughing.

'We said that everything was okay and he sent us to the locker room. I went to the coach after practice and asked whether I could talk to him for a minute.

'I asked him what he had against me, then he started shouting at me. He also insulted me. He said things like “f*** off”.

'I heard about the suspension (on Thursday morning and) I accept it.'

But the Ghanaian FA claimed the decision to suspend Boateng was due to 'vulgar insults targeted at coach Kewsi Appiah'.

‘The decision takes immediate 
effect. The decision was taken following Boateng’s vulgar verbal insults 
targeted at coach Kwesi Appiah during the team’s training session in 
Maceio this week,' read the statement.

‘Boateng 
has since showed no remorse for his actions which has resulted in the 
decision.

'Boateng’s accreditation for the 2014 World Cup has been 
withdrawn with immediate effect.’

The
 Ghanaian FA went on to claim Muntari's banishment came after a meeting descended into chaos on 
Tuesday.

The decision (on Muntari) was taken in the wake of 
his unprovoked physical attack on an Executive Committee member of the 
GFA and a management member of the Black Stars, Mr. Moses Armah on 
Tuesday 24th June, 2014 during a meeting,' it read.

‘Muntari’s accreditation for the 2014 World Cup has been withdrawn with immediate effect.’
