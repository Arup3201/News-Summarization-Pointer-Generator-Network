Police evidence about the links between murdered Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko and British intelligence will be heard in secret, a court was told yesterday.

Mr Litvinenko, 43, was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 allegedly while having tea with former KGB agents Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovturn at a central London hotel in 2006.

It has been claimed that both MI5 and MI6 had regular contact with the former security officer about his work in Russia. But parts of a Scotland Yard investigation into these links will not be made public during the inquest into his death, at the Government’s request.

A pre-inquest hearing yesterday was 
told the police evidence might reveal whether his death was a ‘targeted 
assassination’ carried out by agents of the Russian state.

The Daily Mail has led criticism of 
Government plans to allow ‘closed material procedures’, in which cases 
can be conducted behind closed doors in any civil or inquest hearing.

While lying stricken in a London 
hospital bed, Mr Litvinenko said Moscow ordered his death because of his
opposition to government officials, including President Vladimir Putin.

Hugh Davies, counsel for the inquest, 
told yesterday’s hearing in central London that the contents of the 
police report are known to his team and to the coroner, Sir Robert Owen.

But they will not be disclosed to the 
other interested parties represented at the inquest, at the request of 
the Government. This evidence will be redacted, or blacked out.

Mr Davies said: ‘Claims have been made
that Mr Litvinenko had contact with British intelligence prior to his 
death. The Metropolitan Police Service made an inquiry into these 
claims.

‘Pending the outcome of the disclosure
exercise currently under way, the product of these inquiries, which are
known to you sir and counsel and solicitors to the inquest, has been 
redacted from the report at the request of Her Majesty’s Government.

‘This redaction should not be taken as indicating one way or the other whether Mr Litvinenko did indeed have any such contact.’

Statement: Mrs Litvinenko speaks to members of the media as she leaves the hearing into the death of her husband, who died from polonium poisoning in London in 2006

Mr Litvinenko, who had been granted 
political asylum in the UK, was allegedly poisoned at the Millennium 
Hotel in Grosvenor Square on November 1, 2006. He died in hospital three
weeks later. The full inquest is due finally to begin early next year.

Sir Robert, a High Court judge, said 
he endorsed the comments of the original coroner who opened the case 
that it was in the ‘public, national and international’ interests to 
examine allegations the Russian authorities ordered Mr Litvinenko’s 
death.

Ben Emmerson QC, representing Mr 
Litvinenko’s widow Marina and son Anatoli, said that if such claims were
true it would mean Russia was behind ‘state-sponsored nuclear terrorism
on the streets of London’.

Scotland Yard and the Crown 
Prosecution Service have both named Lugovoy and Kovtun as their prime 
suspects, but Russia has refused to extradite them. Both deny 
involvement.

Outside court, Mrs Litvinenko said: ‘I
believe we will get justice in Britain – we need the truth. Any truth 
is very important for all of us, my friends, my family and the public. 
It was a British citizen killed here, a British soul, a killing that had
never happened before.’
