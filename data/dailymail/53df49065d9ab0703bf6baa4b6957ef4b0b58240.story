A 19-year-old is paralysed from the waist down after a stray bullet struck her spine as she watched TV in her family home.

Dominique Romero, of Richmond, California, was sitting on her sofa when an unknown gunman fired up to nine shots in the street outside her home.

One of the rounds went through the wall, punched through her arm and hit her spine. Her family have now confirmed she has been paralysed from the gunshot.

Her mother, Lori Romero, says her daughter is being impressively stoic about the challenge she faces.

'My heart is broken. I can't imagine what my baby is going through,' she told ktvu.com. 'She didn't even cry. She's like, "I'd rather be paralyzed mom, than gone".'

Her brother Chris Solis described how he heard the gunshots and then his sister screaming. He called emergency services as his stepfather applied pressure to the wound.

He said: 'It hurts because I'm used to her being full of life and running around.'

Richmond police said they have yet to track down the person who fired the barrage of shots, but do not suspect the family's home was being targeted.

'This was kind of a freak thing where it went into the house and hit her,' Sgt. Nicole Abetkov told the Contra Costa Times.

Police in Richmond are offering a $15,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the peopleÂ  involved in the shooting.

Miss Romero reportedly used her savings to buy Christmas presents for her nieces and nephews before she was shot, according to the newspaper. The gifts are still sitting undisturbed in her closet.

The family says the community has rallied round the stricken teen and are helping to raise funds.

'I've lived in Richmond 27 years, and it's a violent city, there's no denying that,' Mr Solis said. 'But to see all of these people reaching out is overwhelming.

'It's keeping my sister in good spirits, knowing the whole community has her back.'
