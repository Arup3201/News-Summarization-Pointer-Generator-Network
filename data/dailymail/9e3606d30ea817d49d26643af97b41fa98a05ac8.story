THE big freeze will tighten its grip on the country today and last well into the New Year, according to forecasters.

After swathes of Britain woke up to inches of snow yesterday, the Met Office said the cold spell will continue for the next four weeks at least, unleashing sub-zero temperatures, snow, freezing fog and icy 30mph winds.

Forecasters said temperatures would remain colder than average for the ‘foreseeable future’.

The Met Office refused to be drawn on the chances of a white Christmas but bookies last night slashed the odds to 5/1 in the capital.

In other cities across the country the odds were drawn in to 6/1.

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams said the arctic blast would begin tonight and last into the New Year, and perhaps beyond it.

‘Temperatures by both day and night are most likely to be below average during the next few weeks,’ he said. ‘There’s going to be a greater incidence of overnight frost and, at times, fog or freezing fog.

‘The signal for rain and snowfall amounts during this period shows a high degree of uncertainty.

‘On balance, slightly drier conditions compared to average are favoured for most of the UK.

‘Even though there is a drier-than-average signal for much of the UK, where rain does occur, there is a greater chance that it will fall as snow compared to normal.’

Up to two inches (5cm) of snow fell across Cumbria yesterday morning, with one and a half (4cm) in Teesside and County Durham and an inch in Albemarle, Northumberland.

Insurance
payouts following severe flooding in Britain that damaged 1,800 
households could total £100million, it was reported last night.

Areas
in Somerset and County Durham have been hit hard by the flooding, and 
rural insurer NFU Mutual expects to pay out £20million.

The
Association of British Insurers said its firms are preparing for a 
£100million payout to cover damaged homes and replace possessions.

An
ABI spokesman told the Daily Mirror: 'Those left with homes that are 
uninhabitable or really badly damaged are being given top priority.'

In December 2010 – the coldest December since records began in 1910 – schools were shut, the transport network ground to a halt and temperatures regularly dropped to between -10C (14F) and -20C (-4F) overnight.

The cold weather that year continued into the New Year.

While it might not be that fun for 
humans to find themselves outside in the cold at the moment, at least 
it’s an attractive option to another type of species.

A record number of swans are flocking 
to Britain from Iceland to enjoy the recent cold snap - with more due to
fly over in the next few weeks.

These amazing images taken at the 
Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust Martin Mere Wetland Centre show thousands 
of Whooper Swans gathered on a wetland.

A full count of Whooper Swans 
yesterday by staff at the wetland centre in Burscough, Lancashire, 
produced a record number of 2,480 birds.

The highest previous count of the thin-necked large white swans was 2,100 two years ago, which also coincided with a cold snap.

Centre boss Andy Wooldridge said: ‘We usually get peak numbers of Whooper Swans in mid to late December so I still think numbers will continue to rise.‘The recent cold weather has certainly encouraged birds which roost elsewhere to visit, allowing us to offer a fantastic spectacle during the swan feeds.’

Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cambridge meanwhile visited the Welsh village of St Asaph which was hit by floods last week.

More than 400 homes were flooded when the River Elwy broke its banks.

The Prince and Duchess spoke to the family of 91-year-old Margaret Hughes who died during the floods.

Rescue teams worked from the early hours of last Tuesday to evacuate residents after the River Elwy reached a record high of 14ft 3in (4.35m).

Charles has asked one of his charities, Business in the Community (BITC), to form a Business Emergency Recovery Group (BERG) to assist the recovery operation in St Asaph.

- THOUSANDS of motorists were trapped on a Russian motorway for three days after 3ft of snow fell over the weekend.

Field kitchens were set up along the M10 between Moscow and St Petersburg to feed people in the queue that stretched 124 miles.

Traffic had started moving slowly yesterday for the first time since Friday.

The Met Office last night re-issued 
snow warnings for parts of northern England and Scotland amid the 
possibility of more snowfall in the coming hours.

The snow is then expected to make its way south towards Wales and the Midlands.

‘We have a band of rain moving 
southwards on Wednesday,’ added Mr Williams. ‘As it makes contact with 
the cold air over the UK it could turn into snow.’

Temperatures yesterday dropped to 
-4.8C (23F) in Santon Downham, in Norfolk, and are expected to fall as 
low as -7C (19F) by tomorrow.

The big freeze will almost certainly 
increase the strain on the transport networks and heighten fears that 
Britain is now heading towards a record-breaking cold winter.
