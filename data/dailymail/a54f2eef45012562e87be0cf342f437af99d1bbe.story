F1 heiress Petra Ecclestone is reeling after £500,000 worth of jewellery was apparently stolen from her £32million mansion - after it was viewed by a fake 'Kazakh millionaire', MailOnline can reveal today.

The 24-year-old blonde, who is the daughter of Formula 1 billionaire Bernie Ecclestone, has put her home in London's Belgravia on the market - but was stunned to discover the disappearance of diamond earrings and a diamond Rolex watch following a viewing.

Petra, a married mother-of-one, has been staying in London for the summer with her baby daughter Lavinia and her husband James Stunt.

Her main home is in Los Angeles, where she lives in a £55million ($85million) estate previously owned by Candy Spelling, and a friend told MailOnline: 'Petra was out with her sister Tamara a few weeks ago when the viewing took place. As soon as this man left, it was discovered that the jewellery, which was on a bedroom nightstand, was missing.'

Furious: Petra Ecclestone has been left reeling after £500,000worth of jewellery was stolen during a viewing of her $32million London home. She joined her sister Tamara for a shopping trip at Harrods on Thursday

Do you have £32 million? Petra Ecclestone's Belgravia mansion is up for sale

Both Ecclestone sisters have their homes up for sale.

Tamara, 29, has also listed her house in Chelsea, West London, for £19.75 million after moving into a new home with her husband Jay Rutland that she bought for £45million in Kensington Palace Gardens in 2011, and the property has not been lived in for some time.

Estate agents have reported in the past few months that a man calling himself Oleg who wears sunglasses - has viewed several other multi-million dollar properties in the area. It is now understood Oleg is not his real name.

Police were NOT called as Petra was worried about a media leak- and she is not claiming for the theft on insurance. Meanwhile, all household staff were immediately checked by security, but found to be clean.

In an interview in Grazia magazine in January 2011, where she posed sprawling in her London home, Petra showed off a picture of Raquel Welch on a cross taken by Terry O'Neill and it was reported that she had a collection of Rolex watches.

She was said to own seven, at an average cost of £20,000 each, at the time.

The house also features artwork by Damien Hirst.

Another broker who sells some of London's most expensive homes in Belgravia told MailOnline a colleague had met a man claiming to be called 'Oleg'. 

Sources say they believe this to be the man responsible for the theft from Petra's home.

The property agent said 'Oleg' had turned up in a chauffer-driven Bentley, but he never removed his sunglasses.

'He wanted to see a very expensive house through me and the owner was in town, so they weren't doing viewings.'

Discussing the Ecclestone theft, the broker added: 'Subsequently, I heard he had been shown around a house in Belgravia and swiped jewellery.

American dream: Petra Ecclestone bought Aaron and Candy Spelling's Holmby Hills mansion for $85 million in July 2011. The estate had been on the market for $150 million and was the most expensive listing in America

'Now, no-one can find him and he's 
not responding to the numbers they have for him. I know the family who 
own the property are extremely unhappy.

But of course, he can only play this trick once.

'This theft has now been relayed 
among the people who work in this property market.'

Although 'Oleg' had looked a 'super prime' real estate through a number of agents in London over the past two months, this is believed to be his first theft.

Petra is believed to have flown back to Los Angeles this week and is said to be shaken by the incident.

In July 2011, she became the owner of Candy Spelling's 57,000 square foot mansion in Holmby Hills.

Candy Spelling is the widow of Aaron 
Spelling who produced TV shows Charlie's Angels, Dynasty, Starsky and 
Hutch, Beverly Hills, 90210, and Melrose Place.

The deed of trust showed that Petra borrowed almost the entire asking price for the sprawling mansion, apart from £1.67million ($2,565,940) from her mother Slavica Ecclestone.

Originally on the market for £97.6million ($150million) it was the most expensive listing in America - and Petra said she needed the room for her dogs.

There are said to be special rooms dedicated to activities like wrapping presents and storing silverware, in addition to the usual luxurious amenities such as a wine cellar, beauty salon, bowling alley, screening room, library, and gym. It also has parking spaces for 100 cars.

Last August, her father Bernie, 81 - who is said to be worth £3billion - secretly married Brazilian marketing director Fabiana Flosi, 35, at Le Lion, his £23million chalet in the exclusive resort of Gstaad. His two daughters did not attend the wedding.

Despite a 46-year age gap, Mr Ecclestone and Miss Flosi began dating in 2009 following the end of his 23-year marriage to Slavica, the mother of his two daughters They met through their work on the Brazilian Grand Prix where Miss Flosi is F1’s vice-president of marketing.

A spokeswoman for Petra told MailOnline today: 'The theft occurred at the London house during a property viewing. the family were not home at the time. no further comment will be made.'

A spokesman for the broker who is believed to have shown Oleg Petra's house has not yet responded to calls.
