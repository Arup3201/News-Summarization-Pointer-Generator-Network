Trainers have been the 
footwear staple this season; they were on countless catwalks at fashion week and every celebrity owns a pair of designer kicks. Sick of the trend? Sorry folks, it's here to stay for another season so grab yourself some sneakers.

And no, we don't mean a subtle pair of black on black New Balance, this season the humble trainer has undergone a total re-brand and for AW14 it's souped up, wedged and, as Vogue says, practically on steroids.

Once
 the reserve of the super fit, the traditional
 running shoe has been given some serious style credentials in its new funky form.

Step to it: This season, the trainer trend takes a psychedelic twist and the louder and brighter, the better. This Giuseppe Zanotti design, left, will, however, set you back £1,025 and Chanel's offering, right, costs a cool £700

It all started at Chanel, where Karl Lagerfeld sent Cara Delevingne and co down the catwalk in colourful tweed trainers and the fash pack followed suit.

Since then Katie
 Grand, editor of LOVE magazine, has collaborated with trainer makers 
Hogan to create wild looking designs combining neon colours and animal 
print, while Stella McCartney’s designs for trainer giant Adidas have 
been a huge hit.

Long-time fan: Model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne is rarely 
seen off duty without a pair of pimped up trainers on, like the

Delhi-born designer Ashish designed stand-out LED Buffalo Boots for Topshop.The light-up wedge trainers have already been spotted on Lily Allen, 
Lady Gaga, Ellie Goulding and Rita Ora - however, at £350, they don't 
come cheap.

So high into the stratosphere of the
 fashion gods has the blinged up, custom trainer risen, that Selfridges has devoted its entire shoe department (the largest in the 
world) to sneakers.

A massive central display is devoted to a single designer, alternating regularly to show all the seasons trainer trends.

Helen
 Attwood, shoe buying manager for Selfridges, says: 'It's a revolution. 
Out of all our footwear categories we are repeating orders mostly on 
flats and trainers. They are selling out across every price point.'

‘From high street and sports labels to high fashion, it really is the most fun and democratic show trend we’ve seen in ages.’

Famous fans: Justin Bieber and Rita Ora love their souped up trainer styles and it seems they both have a pair for every day of the week

First look: The wacky shoes were unveiled at Ashish's AW14 runway show and they're coming to a store near you next week

Of course she's got some! Savvy dresser Lily Allen has already got her hands on the coveted trainers

And it seems the designers themselves also agree.

Rebecca
 Farrar-Hockley, creative director at Kurt Geiger, said: 'There's 
definitely a radical shift towards lower heels. Sneakers are really on 
trend.

'Girls are getting used to being able to run about and I don't think they are going back to the big high heels.'

Celebrities
 can't get enough of running shoes off duty, and the latest versions loved by  
include creations designs in rare animal skins, bespoke pairs and 
serious designer label bling.

But how do you pull them off this season? Vogue's Jessica Bumpus mused: 'Wear them with your skate gear, wear them with your ballgown, this is footwear with cross-occasion appeal.

'Step out in glitter-bright or colour-blocked versions, or those with jewelled flower details - there's something out there to satisfy even the most reluctant of trainer-wearers.'

Pricy: Isabel Marant is currently the queen of 
sneakers, with one extremely long waiting list for her wedged trainer, 
which comes in a variety of funky designs and costs several hundred pounds

DIY: The Nike Blazer (£85) can be customised on nike.com with a choice of colours , patterns and material for every part of the sneaker

Get creative: The classic Nike Air max 1 is as popular now as 
it ever has been, but now comes in a kaleidoscopic range of designs and 
colours (£150, nike.com)

Trainers are also known as as kicks, trabs daps, sandshoes, gym boots or joggers, gutties, or canvers, according to Wikipedia.

The
 first athletic shoes, with a canvas upper and rubber sole, were 
developed as beachwear in the 1830s by the Liverpool Rubber Company. 
They were  known then as plimsolls or pumps.

By
 the early 1900s, sneakers were being produced by small rubber companies
 who specialized in the production of bicycle tyres. U.S. Rubber, 
introduced Keds in 1916, about the same time that Converse was marketing
 its All Star.

At first, the
 market for sneakers was small and practically invisible, but after the 
First World War, the US turned to sports and athletes as a way to 
demonstrate moral fibre and patriotism.

A
 huge breakthrough came in when the Olympics were revived after the 
Second World War, attracting more fans not only to sports, but to 
sneakers as well.

The 
1950s gave American families more leisure time, and as the baby boom 
started, more families chose to dress their youth in sneakers as school 
dress codes relaxed.

In 
the early 1960s, sneakers were imported to the US from Japan, but 
accounted for only a small portion of the market until Nike founders 
Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman began importing Onitsuka Tiger shoes 
(1950s) under the name Blue Ribbon Sports.

By
 the 1970s and 80s there were shoes for football, jogging, basketball, 
running - every sport had its own shoe and trainers had graduated to the
 movies.

Dustin Hoffman wore them while playing reporter Carl Bernstein in the 
movie All the President's Men while Cybill Shepherd even wore a pair of 
comfortable orange sneakers with her elegant black gown at the 1985 Emmy
 Awards.

Woody Allen wore them to the ballet and Led Zeppelin had them on in their 1976 documentary.

Companies
 like Nike and Adidas cashed in on the craze with major endorsements to 
players - the largest  to Chicago basketball player Michael Jordan, who 
was given  a contract with Nike to make his own signature line of shoes 
and apparel.
