Colourful Christmas jumpers have become all the rage during the festive period - but now it seems even animals have joined the fashion herd.

Adorable fashion-conscious cow Gloria has got into the festive spirit by modelling her own Christmas jumper to help fight poverty in Africa.

This year, the charity Send a Cow is aiming to send 20,000  gifts, sold through its Christmas catalogue, to stricken families living in seven African countries.

And, to kick-start the cause, the Jersey purebred - who is the charity's ambassador - has posed in her own custom-fitted knitted jumper.

Arts and crafts specialist Elise Hurcombe, from Bristol, visited Gloria at her farm in Devon to measure her up for the patterned red and blue festive jersey. 

Gloria - who even added a Santa's hat as the finishing touch - did not bat an eyelid as Ms Hurcombe attached Velcro straps to her existing coat.

Unlike more conventional Christmas jumper, Gloria's garment features chickens, cows and vegetables - the gifts the charity hopes people will buy to help the families. 

The countries the charity helps are Uganda, Lesotho, Zambia, Burundi, Rwanda, Kenya and Ethiopia.

Grandmother Christine, a 68-year-old farmer living in Uganda, told how the charity helped change her family's life.

She said: 'Since I started working for Send a Cow I have learnt how to make my land thrive.

'We eat vegetables every day. I've really noticed the difference in my grandchildrens' health and they really don't get sick often anymore.'

The charity wants to provide livestock for families and teach them how to farm.

In their new gift catalogue, one present is a 'Local Cow' which, for £205, provides a family with milk and manure for farming, the charity says. 

Simon Barnes, CEO of Send a Cow, said: 'This year we've taken the idea of the quirky Christmas jumper one step further, to encourage people to think differently about the gifts they buy this Christmas. 

'We really hope that you will support us this year by buying a gift, to help us change even more lives this Christmas and beyond.'
