Getting married is cherished as the biggest and best day of your life - so would you let strangers decide how it will unfold?

That's exactly what Cara Day, 29, and David Giles, 32, from Dorset, are doing after winning a competition run by Pearl Drops.

The couple have passed the entire decision-making for their white wedding over to the public who will choose everything from where the reception will take place to what the bride will wear.

Dress A: Bride-to-be Cara in the Essense of Australia gown which has layers of beautiful tulle and a detachable decorated sash

Dress B: A Martina Liana design with a sweetheart neckline and embroidered Alencon lace with a long train

Dress C: Enzoani's 'Dakota' gown in ivory with a sweetheart neckline, fitted bodice, and a flared mermaid skirt

A public vote has already decided that their venue will be the picturesque Larmer Tree Gardens in Salisbury, Wiltshire.

And voting is now underway to decide which dress mother-of-three Cara will walk down the aisle in. Lucky for the bride-to-be, she looks stunning in each of the three choices - which are all strapless with a sweetheart neckline.

Dress A, by Essense of Australia, has layers of beautiful tulle, a figure-flattering bodice and a detachable decorated sash.

Dress B is a Martina Liana design with a sweetheart neckline and embroidered Alencon lace with a train with scalloped lace edging.

The final choice, dress C, is Enzoani's 'Dakota' gown in ivory with a sweetheart neckline, fitted bodice, and a flared mermaid skirt. 

Soon to be Mr and Mrs: David and Cara will have been together for five years when they tie the knot in October

Despite giving up all control over her white wedding, Cara said she and David are 'extremely excited about the whole process'. The up side of them sacrificing decision-making is that their £25,000 nuptials will all be paid for.

The couple won the prize after entering Pearl Drops competition when it opened in May. They won the judges over with their 30 second video which showed them larking around and revealed how much their three children - Maya, aged nine, Giana, three, and Arabella, 14 months, wanted their parents to tie the knot. They held up signs stating they would love to be bridesmaids and share the same surname.

Now their dream has come true as their mother and father will become Mr and Mrs at a ceremony in October.

When they tie the knot, Cara and David will have been together for five years, although they have known each other since they were teenagers.

Cara explains: 'We first dated when we were around 17 years old, but it only lasted a month or so and we went our seperate ways and bizarrely never saw each other again, even though we have lived in a five mile radius of each other.

'It wasn't until eight years later, I had a random dream about David one night, which resulted in me thinking about him and wondering how he was and what he was up to. I ended up searching for him on Facebook.

Dream come true: The couple have three daughters who can't wait to be bridesmaids after their parents won the prize of a £25,000 wedding

'I contacted him and found that he was severely ill in hospital and was in the process of being diagnosed with Crohns disease, the same thing I was diagnosed with shortly after we had split up when I was 18 years old.

'I offered to come into hospital to see him and talk to him about my experience with having Crohns disease and maybe offer some advice. When we met again even though we hadn't seen each other in years there was no awkwardness at all and we didn't stop talking until I was kicked out at the end of visiting hours!'

She added: 'When I left the hospital all I could think about was seeing him again and thankfully the feeling was mutual as we constantly talked for the next week until he was discharged.'

Their relationship went from strength to strength and David soon moved in with Cara and her daughter, Maya, from a previous relationship, who was four at the time.

However, plans for a big white wedding were far from their minds due to David's ill-health. He had to return to hospital for an operation and the couple experienced some financial difficulties.

Cara said: 'The start of our relationship wasn't all "hearts and flowers" but we never seemed to struggle, we just got on with fixing all the things that went wrong and putting the pieces back together. One of the reasons I think we're so strong as a couple is because we are constantly laughing together, until this day David is still the funniest person I have ever met!'

The couple then decided to try for a baby and Giana was born on 3rd May 2011. Cara then sadly had a miscarriage in 2012 but she was delighted when they then welcomed Arabella who was born on 10th May 2013.

David proposed on Christmas Day 2013 and now Cara said she can't wait till the day they officially become man and wife.

She said: 'We have three beautiful girls and David and I are still inseparable, I don't know who is more excited when Dave comes home from work, our daughters or me! 

'I cannot wait for the day that I can finally call him my husband.'
