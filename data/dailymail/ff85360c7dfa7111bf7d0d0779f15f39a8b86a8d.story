Adorable footage of a puppy Husky talking back to its owner has appeared online and it’s making quite a stir.

The clip features  baby Ramsey whining while attempting to speak, much to the delight of Texan owner Kayla Cagnola, who holds the puppy in her arms.

Trying to perfect what appears to be either a howl or her skills in conversation, the dog looks down on the room and begins yapping while struggling to break free. 

Ramsey appears to be attempting to perfect her skills in conversation by howling  in a frenetic manner

Reacting to a howl, the puppy continues communicating frenetically before coming face to face with another dog – seemingly as baffled as anyone else as to what Ramsey is trying to say.

According to the Huffington Post, the dog was reacting to being told off after eating her roommate’s dog food.

There are several theories as to how dog-human communication has evolved over the years.

Looking around the room, the puppy begins its high-pitched yapping while struggling to break free

Some believe that communicative skills of dogs arose from the social behaviours of ancestral, group-living wolves.

While others believe that domesticated dogs have either evolved to mimic the behaviours of humans or that they have been selectively bred to be tame and collaborative.

As for howling, dogs do this for a range of reasons including: locating other pack members, keeping strangers away, or calling the pack for hunting.

Dog's may also howl when they are suffering from separation anxiety as a way of communicating with owners and other dogs from a distance.

Whether these apply to Ramsey – who appears to just like making high-pitched noise – however remains to be seen.

So far the original video has been viewed over three million times on YouTube.
