 A hotel in a small Oregon town has failed in its attempt to sue over a scathing TripAdvisor write-up after a judge protected the anonymity of the review.

The Ashley Inn, in Lincoln City, Oregon, demanded $74,500 from user Kelly12, who wrote that the hotel was 'nasty' and even claimed the staff were high on drugs.

Hoteliers asked a court in Multnomah County to compel TripAdvisor to reveal the identity of Kelly12 so they could sue for defamation.

Failed attempt: The Ashley Inn, in Lincoln City, Oregon, tried to sue a TripAdvisor user for $74,500 - but a judge refused to compel the site to reveal their identity

But Judge Christopher Marshall denied the request under laws designed to protect media organizations, the Oregonian reported.

A piece of state legislation from 1973 says that nobody contributing to any kind of media can be forced to provide evidence - unless they are doing something criminal.

The law applies to 'any medium of communication to the public', a definition which TripAdvisor's attorneys said applied to them.

Lawyers for the Ashley Inn said the review was obviously false. It referred to a March 2014 stay by a guest from Prescott, Arizona - which the lawyers said did not match any hotel records.

Protected: According to a Multnomah County judge, TripAdvisor is subject to protection under media laws

The piece itself, published in April, included observations such as: 'laundry and housekeeping are either high or drunk', and 'breakfast is nasty, the rooms are nasty'.

It also claimed: 'the owner smokes weed' and that a receptionist 'had phone sex with someone.'

The review has since been taken down - but the hotel owners are still unsatisfied.

Jeffrey Frasier, an attorney for the business, said the ruling is 'disappointing because it leaves our client without a remedy.'

'You can’t sue a ghost.'
