The interior walls of training complexes are invariably decorated with motivational slogans. Simple truisms to feed the mind on days when the body is weak.

For Craig Gordon, the old wisdom – fail to prepare, then prepare to fail – is more a way of life than a fleeting thought.

To the uninitiated, tomorrow’s final will be settled over 90, maybe 120 minutes, with the lingering possibility of penalty kicks.

Celtic keeper Craig Gordon is fully focused  ahead of the Scottish League Cup Final with Dundee Utd.

But, long before the first ball is kicked in earnest, the Celtic goalkeeper fully expects to be ahead in the battle of wits.

While much of what will transpire between Celtic and Dundee United will be random and instinctive, Gordon believes his slavish devotion to studying what’s liable to be thrown at him can significantly shorten the odds on his side coming out on top.

‘Every game,’ he replied when asked how frequently he’d dip into video analysis. ‘Free kicks, penalties, the way strikers like to finish the ball, how they strike the ball.

‘I just look at those things and keep mental notes on how they like to do things and what’s their favourite side. Notes are taken on different players so I know. All of that stuff.

‘It’s about taking that research out on the training pitch, too, and practicing for who you’re going to be playing against - a team that likes to put a lot of low, early crosses into the box, for example.

‘For the Rangers game, it was deep early crosses hung up to the back post so we focused our training around that. That played out during the game too as I was able to come and take the deep crosses that were taking the pressure off. Between all of us we come up with a plan for the game.’

And when that plan comes together in the form of a victory and a clean sheet?

‘Absolutely, it’s satisfying,’ Gordon added. ‘It becomes a team effort with Woodsy (Stevie Woods, the goalkeeping coach) and the video analysis guys to ensure we’re as well prepared as possible. And that’s not just me - John Collins does it with midfielders and defenders, so it’s preparation.

‘What we’re trying to do is make the game as easy as possible for us so we know what we’re coming up against.’

Celtic have not reinvented the wheel with their forensic approach. Nine years ago, Gordon played in the Scottish Cup Final for Hearts against Gretna – his last major final as it would transpire.

Few neutral observers fancied the Borderers to go the distance that day but they did just that. Gordon’s intervention in the final chapter was key, however. As Hearts hit four perfect kicks, he saved from Derek Townsley before watching Gavin Skelton sky the eighth and final kick over the top.

‘I had a fair idea of most of the Gretna penalty takers,’ he recalled. ‘I had seen penalties from them. Most were from memory. With penalties, nowadays everyone does their homework.’

That stop from 12 yards not only allowed Gordon to lift the only major honour of his career to date - it cemented his reputation as one of the finest goalkeepers Scotland has produced.

When a £9million move to Sunderland was completed a year later, it seemed he’d spend half his life on the winner’s podium.

Little did he realise at the time, how unique those scenes of celebration would prove. A year ago, with the road back from injury seemingly never ending, the chance of another fix of the winning feeling seemed fanciful.

‘I probably didn’t appreciate at the time like I should have done - playing in a cup final, winning a cup,’ he reflected.

‘Albeit it’s a different competition this Sunday but it’s still to win a cup, I probably did think it would come around again, that I’d get another chance.

‘I haven’t been close until now so I’m going to enjoy this one a little bit more, but then I’ll only really enjoy it if we win the match.

‘It’s not something I’ll look back on fondly if we don’t. Certainly I want to take it in a little more this time.’

Hearts’ 2006 Hampden triumph was obviously memorable. Yet lurking just beneath the surface lay a sense of regret.

George Burley’s side had started the campaign like a train but being unbeaten and top of the league in October wasn’t enough to shield him from Vladimir Romanov’s axe.

John McGlynn took temporary charge before Graham Rix arrived. In time, he was bulleted to make way for Valdas Ivanauskas.

Despite the endless turmoil, Hearts still split the Old Firm, with Rangers nudged into third place. There are those in Gorgie who will go to their graves believing they could have gone one better had it not been for in the insanity of the man at the top.

‘We’ll never know,’ Gordon shrugged. ‘Would more have been achieved? It may have but it may not. You can speculate but no-one at the time could have told if there was more to come from that group of players. It was still a successful time and one I’ll remember fondly for the rest of my years.’

They were, to put it mildly, colourful days. Romanov’s liking for self-harm culminated in Gordon, Steven Pressley and Paul Hartley taking the unusual step of holding a press conference to air their frustrations. The Riccarton Three, as they were dubbed, all lived to tell the tale.

‘It was great days playing in a great team and enjoying playing football,’ Gordon reflected. ‘They’re the things people remember when you finish.

‘It was a really good team and when that team gets back together it’s a special time for the Hearts fans because they were packing out the ground every week and winning most matches at home and scoring lots of goals.

‘There was always a downside but on the other side of that we were quite successful on the pitch. It was a good team.

‘Whatever went on elsewhere was something which didn’t really affect us. That was because of the strength of the characters we had.

‘There are players from that team and some really good characters. Quite a few of that team have gone into management and will probably continue to do so.’

While Hartley, Pressley and Robbie Nielson have done just that, Gordon still has many races to run as a player.

Still in contention for three trophies as Celtic’s No1, a nine-year wait to feel a winner’s medal around his neck again could be emphatically bookended in the coming weeks.

‘It’s hard, we have played a lot of games already,’ Gordon added. ‘But that’s something you have to deal with when you’re fighting on so many fronts. Trying to win three trophies is going to take its toll but these are the games you have to get through and recover well between times.

‘Up until now we’ve managed it pretty well. Even when we’ve not been playing well we’ve still managed to get through and get the results.

‘I don’t think that’s a problem. It’s part and parcel of having a successful season. It’s something you have to deal with and we will.’

So far, he’s dealt with just about everything that been cast his way. From the cynics that felt signing a long-term crock to replace Fraser Forster would only end one way, to the strikers in Scotland and across Europe who have found him back to his imperious best.

It’s not taken long for the smoke signals to be seen down south either. Chelsea have been linked with a move for the 32-year-old as back-up for Thibaut Courtois this summer. But surely Gordon, who effectively still has a two-year tie to Parkhead, has spent enough time watching football these past three years to not voluntarily do so again?

‘Who says I couldn’t be No1, like?’ he laughed. ‘It’s flattering but I’ll just concentrate on doing what I’m doing and we’ll see what happens after that.’
