A holiday cottage for Santa in Las Vegas has burned to the ground after a Christmas tree caught fire at an open-air mall.

The 45ft artificial tree caught fire at about 2am on Christmas morning, several hours after the Town Square mall had closed.

The blaze spread to a Norman Rockwell-inspired cottage where Santa had posed for pictures with children and pets over the holiday period.

When fire crews arrived flames were reaching 100ft in the air. The blaze was so prominent that a guest staying at a resort half a mile from the mall called 911 after spotting it.

Faulty wiring is believed to have caused the fire, which left only the metal skeleton of the tree and badly damaged the Rockwell-inspired grotto.

'Obviously you never want to experience 
something like this. We're just very grateful nobody was harmed during the fire,' Town Square marketing director Jaimesen 
Mapes said.

The cottage and tree had been the centerpiece of the mall's decorations, and it was due to remain open until the New Year.Â

'The timing is never good for an event 
like this. But we have a strong community here in Vegas, 
and we're confident that the traditions we have at Town Square will 
continue,' Mr Mapes said.

It is not known if the lights on the tree had been on at the time of the fire, but deputy fire chief Jon Klassen said ''something that tall and that shape, it's going to be a big gigantic matchstick'.

An investigation has been started. Deputy Klassen said: 'It was such a total, catastrophic 
event, there wasn't much left for them to investigate. Santa's little house took a lot of heat.'
