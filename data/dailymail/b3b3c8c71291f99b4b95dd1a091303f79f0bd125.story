A new face is joining the Sesame Street gang, this time with a sombre message.

Lily, a pink-faced seven-year-old muppet with red hair, will be introduced to children across the globe as a part of a special hour-long episode on Sunday that deals with the issue of hunger.

The show's producers felt that the topic should be covered as the number of children in the U.S. who are 'food insecure', meaning that access to food is uncertain, is now more than 17 million.

Of those children, 9.6 million are under the age of six.Â

Lily won't be the only guest in the special episode, as country singer Brad Paisley and his actress wife Kimberly Williams-Paisley will be hosting the show.

'Food insecurity is a growing and difficult issue for adults to discuss, much less children,' the Paisleys said in a statement.

The non-profit organisation Sesame Workshop produces the children's show, and it decided to give the topic airtime.

In the special episode, titled Growing Hope Against Hunger, Lily will visit a community garden with characters like Elmo, Bert and Grover.

Additionally, Sesame Workshop launched the 'Food for Thought: Eating Well on a Budget' initiative to coincide with the episode.

Sunday's show is sponsored by food giant Walmart, which is one of the top two largest employers in the world.

The episode will highlight things that communities can do - like build gardens or organise food drives - to help those in need.

Given the delicate nature of 'food insecurity', producers gave a great deal of thought to Lily's backstory.

Jeanette Betancourt, a senior vice president at Sesame Workshop, said: 'We thought long and hard about how do we really represent this from a child's point of view?'

As a result, viewers will see that even minor mannerisms were addressed, including the way that Lily looks down at her feet rather than looking in the eyes of other characters.

'She wants to talk about this topic 
because she knows it will help many other families and children, but it 
isn't an easy topic to talk about in the first place,' Ms Betancourt told The New York Times.

Sesame Street, now in its 42nd season, is well-known for dedicating episodes to talk about sensitive subjects.

Previous topics include children with parents in the military and economic insecurity.

In keeping with the nutrition theme, First Lady Michelle Obama has appeared on the show in 2009 and helped the Muppets plant a vegetable garden.
