Kirsty Cox and Anna Jones gave birth days apart after their gay friend donated sperm to the couple but after breaking the agreement to continue to donate the trio have fallen out.

Nick Lacey, 24, is the biological father to both Alfie and Scarlett-Marie, eight months, but despite promising to stay in the children’s lives and continue to donate sperm so Kirsty and Anna could conceive again, he is no longer on in contact with the pair.

The hairdresser was not present at 
the ‘twins’ christening last week and Anna, 27, said: ‘We’re heartbroken
because we wanted more kids with him. But there’s nothing we can do. At
the moment we’re not even on speaking terms with Nick.’

Anna and Kirsty, 23, who married in a
civil ceremony in 2010 has previously spoken about their baby joy after
they thought they would never be able to have children together.

The NHS would only fund IVF for one 
of them and conceiving naturally was out of the question for both, so 
when Anna’s sister Lorraine told her hairdresser Nick about the couple’s
desire for children.
After a series of meetings, they all agreed that Nick would be the one to donate.

'When we found Nick everything fell into place,' Anna said when the family appeared on Daybreak earlier this year.

'If we hadn’t have found him I don’t think any of this would have happened to be honest.’

Three weeks after they started the 
process of artificial insemination Kirsty became pregnant and a couple 
of weeks later Anna became pregnant too.

On November 5 last year, Kirsty gave 
birth to Scarlett-Marie, who was two weeks overdue. Five days later, 
Anna gave birth to Alfie.

In February Nick said: 'Although I 
don’t see myself as their dad, I adore the babies and I intend to be 
part of their lives forever.

' I never imagined I’d have a child, and I never knew I’d have so much love for them.'

Last week the christening of Alfie 
and Scarlett-Marie were christened at St Peter’s Church, Gloucester in 
front of 100 friends and family members – but not Nick.

However Nick refutes the couple’s claims saying they were the ones who cut him out of their children’s lives.

‘I only heard about the christening on Facebook,’ he told The Sunday Mirror.

According to Nick the trio fell out 
after Anna and Kirsty wanted more sperm only six months after the babies
were born and when he said it was too soon, they stopped all contact.

He said: ‘The babies are my flesh and blood and I want a relationship with them.’
