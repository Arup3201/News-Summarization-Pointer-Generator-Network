A landmark documentary capturing the drama of a murder trial from inside a British court room is to be broadcast on television for the first time.

In an unprecedented move, a film crew was allowed access to an entire case - including the moment a businessman was convicted of murdering his wife.

Cameras have been banned within the precincts of court since 1925.

But Channel 4 was granted permission to follow the six-week retrial of Nat Fraser at the High Court in Edinburgh in 2012.

The documentary has reignited the debate about how much access television cameras should be given to British courts.

Bafta-winning filmmaker director 
Nick Holt, who directed the documentary, said it was right that the public were given 
greater access to the court system.

He told the Independent: 'We
have a right to see this process which costs us an enormous amount of 
money and which we are very good at and very thorough at.

'There is 
nothing to hide, nothing shameful going on. The process of filming 
demystifies the legal process.'

Historic: In a first in British legal history, cameras recorded legal proceedings from inside the court room

Warning: Some legal experts have warned opening up the court room to cameras could harm justice

The previous decade has seen a gradual opening up of access for cameras in British courts.

The Government wants the end of a court case to be shown on television so 'justice is seen to be done'.

Scottish courts, last year, allowed the filming of sentencing remarks from Lord Bracadale – who presided over the Fraser retrial.

The two-hour documentary, The Murder Trial, which will be broadcast on Tuesday July 9 at 9pm on Channel 4, used six remotely controlled cameras to capture all the unfolding drama within the court room.

After three years of negotiation the Scottish High Court gave documentary team permission to film the judge, lawyers, defendant and witnesses during the high-profile retrial of Fraser who was accused of killing his wife Arlene.

Her 
body has never been found, there is no weapon, no crime scene and her 
husband appears to have a cast iron alibi for the day she disappeared.

Reservations: Lord Judge says that allowing cameras into crown court sentencing hearings could lead to disruption, including boos and cheers from the gallery

With
over 70 witnesses and 104 pieces of evidence the complex case is 
dissected firstly by the prosecution QC Alex Prentice and then the defence QC John Scott.

Nat
Fraser was first brought to trial in 2003 for the murder of his wife – 
he was found guilty.

But Fraser argued that the trial was a miscarriage 
of justice and challenged the verdict in the highest courts in the land.
The case became a cause celebre.

Eventually, after years of protesting 
his innocence, the conviction was quashed in 2011.

In April 2012, Fraser was sent back to the High Court in Edinburgh for a fresh trial, 
14 years after his wife’s disappearance.

A new jury was sworn in to hear
all the evidence against him.

Broadcasters will be allowed into the Court of Appeal from October and this is likely to be extended to crown court prosecutions.

But opening up of courts to cameras has sparked a heated debate within the legal profession.

The highest judge in the country, Lord Chief Justice Judge, has said filming a sentencing could spark chaos in a courtroom.

He warned that lifting the 90-year-old filming ban could encourage hecklers to yell abuse or even cheer knowing it will be broadcast across the country.

Lord Judge also raised concern that allowing cameras into sensitive cases could prevent witnesses coming forward.
