A child sex offender has claimed Britain's justice system is too lenient on sexual predators as they are 'just chucked out' of prison without undergoing any treatment, leaving them free to attack again.

The 28-year-old child abuser, who gives his name only as Frank, was freed after serving just half of his 30-month prison sentence for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl.

He said that because his behaviour was not addressed while he was in HMP Moorland, after he left prison he 'thought about reoffending a few times' and added: 'I do pose a risk'.

Speaking days after it was revealed that sexual predators are being released back into the community without treatment to prevent them reoffending, because of a shortage of places on sex offender treatment programmes, Frank criticised the lack of treatment available.

And he gave an astonishing insight into the thoughts of a convicted paedophile, telling BBC Radio 5 Live how he blamed his young victim for what he did to her.  And he said that while he hoped never to reoffend, 'you can never say never'.

And he blamed the judge for not giving him a tougher sentence to prevent him reoffending, saying: 'He recommended that I did a course but he didn't attach that to the sentence.'

Frank said he was sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment, of which he spent 15 months in prison before being released on temporary licence.

He said: 'I was literally just chucked out - that's the end of you, go out into the community and be good.

'And I don't think I had the tools to do that.  In fact, I did think about reoffending a few times. 

'Obviously I never [did], but the thoughts were there and that's the problem.  Unless you can control the thought process... there's no help for people that are not as strong-willed as others.'

Prison: The paedophile was imprisoned at HMP Moorland near Doncaster in Yorkshire, where a third of the inmates are sex offenders

Frank has been assessed by the NSPCC, whose experts concluded that he may present a risk to children and say that he should not have unsupervised access to children.

He admitted: 'When I first committed the offence, I completely put the blame totally on my victim.'

He said that the judge didn't make his attending a behaviour treatment course part of the sentence, but merely 'recommended' that he do a course.

He said: 'He obviously gave me my sentence of 30 months and recommended that I attend some kind of treatment programme.'

But the convicted paedophile, who has since worked with the NSPCC and his probation team and now realises he was to blame for his crime, says places on such courses were in short supply in his Yorkshire prison where around a third of the inmates are sex offenders.

He said he was on a wing of about 150 sex offenders, and estimated that while he was there, there were only two courses for 25 people each.

'I spoke to my probation officer in prison on a number of occasions, asking if there's any help that I can get for me.  And basically the answer I got was, well, no, there's just not enough time, there's not enough places'.

Frank said there was a hierarchy in prison where those who'd committed the worst offences were most respected

'They said maybe you could get it when you're released but unfortunately that was the same situation.'

He said that in the wing there was a perverse hierarchy where the worse the sex crime committed, the higher the offender was in the 'bragging network'.

Frank said: 'People used to boast about what they'd done and kind of create a hierarchy...

'For the major reported crimes it was kind of, they was like the king of the wing, and they'd earned the most respect points which is absolutely ridiculous, but that's how it works.'

He said sex offenders 'don't realise the actual hurt they cause to the victims', and added: 'How is one person supposed to better themselves if the opportunity is not being given?'

Frank said: 'I would say in my honest opinion I do pose a risk and I will do until I get the full help that I need.

 

'Obviously I think I'm strong enough in myself not to reoffend, but you can never say never'

'Obviously I think I'm strong enough in myself to not reoffend, but you can never say never.'

Earlier this week it emerged that a report by the National Audit Office said the number of inmates on sex offender treatment programmes was down.

Prisons including HMP Moorland, near Doncaster, HMP Wakefield and HMP Shrewsbury were criticised for having no formal treatment programmes at all, and others, including HMP Parc, HMP Whatton and HMP Maidstone, were criticised for not having enough places on such courses for the number of sex offenders.

Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said: 'We make no apology for holding more sex offenders in prison than ever before.

'It is untrue to say that funding for sex offender treatment programmes has been cut - in fact we are increasing the availability of programmes.

'We provide a range of programmes for this highly complex group of offenders. These are tailored to address an individual's risk and need, and can also include substance misuse, anger management and violence reduction.

'Sex offender treatment programmes are not suitable for every prisoner, in each case a thorough assessment will be carried out.'
