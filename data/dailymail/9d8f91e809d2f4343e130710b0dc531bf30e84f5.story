Is it really magic? The latest device promising to give you sparkling, snowy-white teeth is The £45 Whitening Wand

A dazzling white smile is a prerequisite for any celebrity hoping to make it to the red 
carpet.

After all, they don't call it a Hollywood smile for nothing.

But not everyone can afford the mega-watt A-list look - so they are settling for a rush hour grin instead.

The latest device promising to give you sparkling, snowy-white teeth on the go is The Whitening Wand -- a £45 treatment that has already been snapped up by thousands of commuters.

Dubbed 'the magic wand', the creation claims to be ideal for those looking to whiten their teeth on their morning commute.

Developed by Dr Joe Oliver of London's Welbeck Clinic, the Whitening Wand is applied after the morning brush after which it needs to be left for at least 30 minutes to take effect.

After two weeks of treatment, the wand - which contains hydrogen peroxide to cut through tooth stains - claims to make teeth four shades lighter than their original colour.

And it may cost £45 for just two treatments but that hasn't deterred 2,000 Brits from snapping it up on the first day of sale.

Since then more stocks have been added both online and in stores like beauty chain Space NK.

Speaking about his brainchild, Dr Oliver said: 'Whitening teeth is now part of our beauty and grooming regime.

'However there wasn’t anything on the market which could be used in the customer’s time that was convenient.

'Most treatments involve using light-activating devices which means not only an unpleasant experience but 
you’d have to allow an hour a day to use the treatment.

'In this current climate we 
understand that people are time poor. We wanted to launch a product 
which would show the same results but be used in the comfort of everyday
lives and while on the move.'

Dr Mervyn Druian, Co-Founder of The London Centre for Cosmetic Dentistry, said: 'It appears that the magic wand should be safe, but I’m not sure how effective it is.

'The jury is out for now- look back in 6 months and see if it is still as popular; that’s a good indicator of how effective it actually is.

'The in-surgery tooth whitening treatment along with the home whitening  trays have been proven over and over again to be consistently effective.

'I would highly recommend this type of whitening treatment.'

Food and drink as well as poor 
cleaning, smoking and other factors can affect natural tooth colour and 
stains built up over time.

And clearly the colour of our pearly whites is a major concern for image conscious Brits - and it's big business too.

By 2009, UK sales of 
whitening toothpastes had increased by 15 per cent, rising from 
£55 million in 2006 to £63 million in 2008.
