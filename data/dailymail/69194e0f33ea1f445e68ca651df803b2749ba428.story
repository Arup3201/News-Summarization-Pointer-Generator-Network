He may have missed his chance at moving into the White House but wealthy former presidential candidate Mitt Romney is certainly making sure there is some old school intrigue to his latest property venture.

An overview of the floor plans to the Romney family's new vacation house in Holladay, Salt Lake City, has found a small 11-foot-by-5-foot room hidden behind a bookshelf in the study.

With Romney planning to tear down the home that currently sits on the land, blueprints for the soon-to-be-constructed house show the secret passageway is twice as long as it is wide, with the entry ominously marked in the documents as 'hidden door'.

A fake bookcase would swing open into the study to get into the secret room.

The special alcove runs along the back of the 'coat room' and 'powder room' and is not far from the main entryway.

The plans show the room is lined with cabinets.

The enormous property is set to start building any day now. Romney's study features a book case that swivels open and leads into secret room, The Salt Lake Tribune reports, based on records it obtained

Storage or safe haven? Floorplans uncovered for the new house Mitt Romney is building in Utah show a hidden room will be built behind the study. Fake bookshelves, perhaps like the one pictured here, will mark the doorway to the room, which will be twice as long as it is wide. The plans mark it as being used for 'office storage'

So what's the plan, guys? Mitt Romney and wife Ann have declined to comment about the blueprints of their new house in Holladay, Salt Lake City, which have revealed a hidden room

Front of house: Despite being of decent size already, Romney and his wife Ann will tear down this home they bought in Holladay - their second Utah property - and build something that will better fit their huge family. 'That¿s a good-size house, but he has a lot of grandkids so he needs a place to host everybody,' said Taylor Oldroyd, chief executive of the Utah County Association of Realtor.

The Salt
Lake Tribune, which discovered the room by getting access to the floor 
plans through an open records request, said it has been marked for 
'office storage'.

However the Atlantic Wire has suggested the obvious explanation is that the space would be used as a 'panic room'.

'If we learned anything from the first decade of the 21st century, it's that fancy houses have special rooms in which residents can hide in the event of a home invasion,' The Wire reported.

'Since the Romney's had to give up their Secret Service protection last November, it only makes sense that the family would go out of its way to ensure its safety.'

A spokeswoman for Romney declined to comment on the room.

Panic rooms were made famous by a 2002 thriller starring Jodie Foster, about a mother and daughter who buy a New York brownstone only to be attacked by burglars the night they move in.

The movie, simply called Panic Room, was inspired by a news story at the time about the rise in popularity of fortified rooms being built in grand residences as a safe shelter or hiding place for the owners, according to director David Fincher.

The 5,900-square-foot Holladay house will be the fifth home for the former Republican candidate and his wife Ann, who have five sons and 23 grandchildren.

Sold: The Romney's only recently bought the property from Bere Regis Realty

Romney recently bought an expansive log cabin in the Utah mountain resort of Park City that was on the market for $8.9 million, reports Forbes.

In 2009 Romney sold a similar mansion he had owned in the same area for 14 years.

The new Utah abode was built in 1991 and features six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and over 8,700 square feet of space.

The listing described it as: 'As featured in Architectural Digest, this ‘Utah Rustic’ home gave renowned local architect Fred Babcock the opportunity to stretch beyond what one assumed could normally be achieved in log construction. Comprised of whole logs and many local materials, interior designer David Krajeski created an interior that invites both grand entertaining and cozy relaxation. The architectural design is centered on the two-story great room with massive stone fireplace and magnificent views to the Uinta Mountains and beyond.'

Following much controversy, the California Coastal Commission decided earlier this month to allow the Romney's to move forward with plans to raze their La Jolla beachfront home and replace it with an 11,000-square-foot mansion. A neighbour had complained the house would be too big and block the beach views of other residents

This current house will be torn down for the new uber-home to be built

Romney's third house, in the coastal California town of La Jolla, north of San Diego, has been a recent source of contention.

The politico had planned to tear down the existing 3,000-square-foot home he bought in 2008 for $12 million and build a whopping 11,000-square-foot dream home.

However the plans were stalled on the complaint of a neighbor, who believed the home would be too big.

On Oct. 11 Romney was given the go-ahead after it was concluded the 'vast majority of the square footage will be contained in the basement and first floor' and that the house would not impede on public views along the beach it overlooks.

Rounding out his property portfolio, Romney also has a cabin in New Hampshire and a condo in Belmont, Massachusetts.

Romney's bid to be president came up short when he lost to Barack Obama in the 2012 election.

He has spoken previously about how, when first starting out, he lived in an apartment too small for a dining room table and that he ate dinner off an ironing board.

Ann Romney recently released a new cookbook, 'The Romney Family Table', in which 
she writes about recipes and the food shared by the family through the ups and 
downs of their lives.

'It's really about love and sharing the table and what you learn at the 
table, how you enjoy each other, how you establish traditions,' Ann told The 
Republican.
