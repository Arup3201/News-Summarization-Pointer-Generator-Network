A respected Washington think tank has apologised after sending a tweet to human rights group Amnesty International telling them to 'suck it'. 

The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) blamed an intern for the high-profile mishap - which was broadcast to its more than 81,000 followers.

The tweet was in reply to one posted by the official Amnesty International profile criticising the United States' human rights record - in reference to the current situation in Ferguson, Missouri.

The apology: CSIS blamed an intern for the tweet, saying he meant to send it from a personal account

Amnesty tweeted: 'US can’t tell other countries to improve their records on policing and peaceful assembly if it won’t clean up its own human rights record,' to which CSIS' account replied: 'Your work has saved far few lives than American interventions. So, suck it.'

Andrew Schwartz, senior vice president for external relations at CSIS told BuzzFeed that he was 'embarrassed about this unfortunate situation and the tweet doesn’t reflect anyone’s views at CSIS or the institution as a whole. My colleagues are equally distressed about this.'

He has called and emailed Amnesty to apologise directly. CSIS deleted the tweet shortly after it was sent, saying it was posted 'in error', though it was up long enough for many Twitter users to screenshot it.

Explaining the incident, Mr Schwartz said: 'Here’s what happened, early this morning, an unconscionable tweet was directed to Amnesty from CSIS’s Twitter account. The tweet in no way reflects CSIS’s views.

'It was sent by a CSIS intern who had access to our account for monitoring purposes. Apparently he meant to send something reflecting his personal views from his personal Twitter account. 

'I find his views and the way he expressed them to be abhorrent and will take appropriate action at CSIS to address the matter internally.'

He would not comment on whether the intern has been fired.

The violent clashes between police and protesters in Ferguson prompted Amnesty International to send a human rights team to work in America for the first time ever.

They have criticised the use of tear gas and rubber bullets by officers in the town, where there has been 11 days of unrest after police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

Missouri governor Jay Nixon has pulled the police out of the incident, and replaced them with the National Guard.

Police killed a second black man, a 23-year-old who has not yet been named, on Tuesday night in a nearby St Louis neighbourhood, further aggravating the tension. 

Members of the press have been threatened and arrested as leaders from across the world have come out to criticise the USA's human rights policy.
