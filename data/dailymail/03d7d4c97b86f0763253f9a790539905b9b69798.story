Max Verstappen, the 17-year-old Formula One rookie, has equalled his father Jos’ best-ever grid position in only his second race.

Verstappen Snr, who competed in over 100 grands prix, most notably as team-mate to Michael Schumacher at Benetton in the mid-nineties, qualified sixth for the 1994 Belgian Grand Prix.

And on Saturday his son turned in a performance that goes way beyond his tender years to match his dad’s result during qualifying for tomorrow’s race in Malaysia.

The 17-year-old has equalled his father Jos Verstappen's best-ever qualifying result in only his second race 

The Dutchman, who is still not old enough to drive on his own in his native Holland appeared unfazed by the tricky wet conditions to post a best time of 1:40.793, which was only marginally slower than the Red Bull pair of Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat.

‘I am very proud of that but he has to do a lot better than I did in my career,’ his father Jos said.

Verstappen's sixth position on the grid in Sepang is also the highest by a teenager in more than half-a-century after Ricardo Rodriguez, 19 at the time, started second for Ferrari at the 1961 Italian Grand Prix. 

The Dutchman displayed signs of maturity way beyond his tender years to qualify on the third row 

'I studied the lines from last year so that helped me already a bit,’ said Verstappen. 'I think the most important thing is to just stay cool and do your lap.

'It was a good start for me as I always enjoy driving in the rain. All in all, I can be really happy about getting P6.'

Verstappen was set to finish in the points on his grand prix bow in Australia only for mechanical gremlins to strike his Toro Rosso on lap 34.
