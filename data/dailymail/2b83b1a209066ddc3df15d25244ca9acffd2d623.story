Nato have blamed bad maps for last month's drone strike that killed 24 Pakistani troops at a post close to the Afghan border.

An investigation into the attack concluded that reliance on incorrect mapping information shared with the Pakistani liaison officer resulted in a misunderstanding about the true location of Pakistani military units.'

The US Defence Department said the investigation found US forces - given
 what information they had available to them at the time - reacted in 
self-defence and with appropriate force after being fired upon from the 
direction of the Pakistani border.

A Nato spokesman said: 'The report says we recognise we made mistakes, and that mistakes were also made by the Pakistanis.

'We have a lot of work to do to improve co-ordination, and we've already implemented steps to do that.'

'Inadequate co-ordination by US and 
Pakistani military officers operating through the border co-ordination 
centre - including our reliance on incorrect mapping information shared 
with the Pakistani liaison officer - resulted in a misunderstanding 
about the true location of Pakistani military units,' said the 
statement.

Retaliation: Pakistani authorities have closed-off Nato's supply routes in to Afghanistan for the last 26 days

Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has suggested the country's military is plotting a coup d'Ã©tat.

Tension between the civilian government and the army intensified this week after news leaked of a secret memo sent to Washington asking for help in averting a supposed military coup.

The Supreme Court has begun a hearing into the scandal, which has already forced Pakistan's ambassador to the US to resign and also threatens the president.

The crisis comes as Pakistan faces a violent Taliban insurgency, a failing economy and severe tension with its most important ally, the United States, over the drone attack.

Gilana said: 'Conspiracies are being hatched to pack up the elected government.

While he did not specifically blame the military he later made it clear in a speech to parliament that the army must operate under the control of the government.

He said: 'They have to be answerable to this parliament. They cannot be a state within a state.'

'This, coupled with other gaps in 
information about the activities and placement of units from both sides,
 contributed to the tragic result,' it said.

Nato,
 Afghanistan and Pakistan forces use the joint border control centres to
 share information and co-ordinate security operations.

Since
 the attack on the Pakistani military outposts in mountainous east Kunar
 province, a furious Pakistani government has shut down Nato supply 
routes to Afghanistan and thrown the US out of its Shamsi Air base in 
south-western Baluchistan province.

The base was used to maintain drones used in strikes against insurgents hiding in safe havens in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt on the Afghan frontier.

Washington views Pakisatn's co-operation as crucial to helping to stabilize the region before foreign combat troops leave Afghanistan in 2014.

U.S.- Pakistani relations were already frayed after the secret U.S. raid in May that killed Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.

'For the loss of life - and for the lack of proper co-ordination between US and Pakistani forces that contributed to those losses - we express our deepest regret.

'We further express sincere 
condolences to the Pakistani people, to the Pakistani government, and 
most importantly to the families of the Pakistani soldiers who were 
killed or wounded,' the statement said.

'It
 added that the military's focus would now be to learn from the mistakes
 and 'take whatever corrective measures are required to ensure an 
incident like this is not repeated.'

Hostile: The attacks have strained the relationship between Pakistan and the U.S.

'More critically, we must work to improve the level of trust between our two countries.

'We cannot operate effectively on the border - or in other parts of our relationship - without addressing the fundamental trust still lacking between us.

'We earnestly hope the Pakistani military will join us in bridging that gap,' the statement said.
