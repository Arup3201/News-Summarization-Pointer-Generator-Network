One more defining moment. One more glorious performance by a Scottish athlete who surpassed expectations. One more explosion of joyous noise that shook Hampden to its ancient foundations. And one minor miracle.

Lynsey Sharp, already a European Champion at the age of 24, on Friday produced an astonishing performance in almost impossible circumstances to claim silver in the women’s 800 metres.

After spending three hours on a drip in hospital overnight, Sharp finished second only to World Champion Eunice Sum in a race that had another sell-out crowd roaring themselves hoarse until the final dip, when the local favourite just managed to pip 20-year-old Ugandan rising star Winnie Nanyondo.

Yet the home hero admitted, beset by injuries and illness in a year from hell, admitted that she had been close to withdrawing after a horrendous night.

‘Last night I went out for dinner because I just thought it was the food in the village I wasn’t enjoying,’ she said, adding: ‘I order a lovely 20-quid steak – and I couldn’t face it.

‘I got back to the village, threw up for a few hours and (Team Scotland head coach) Stephen Maguire took me across the clinic.

‘I was there til half five this morning on a drop. All I’ve eaten today is porridge and scrambled egg. I just came out here to leave everything on the track. To have one more obstacle thrown at me was just laughable – I had one shot, two minutes to give it everything.

‘At half two last night, I couldn’t bend over to take my socks off because the cramps were so bad. I was wondering how the hell I could run. But somehow, another miracle.

‘I slept from half five until nine, then an hour before lunch. But I don’t know how I managed that. I’m just hoping I can enjoy some rubbish food now. I’ve been looking forward to it for days and weeks.

‘Two things I’ll never forget. One is being on my hands and knees being sick, with the nurse holding my hair back, Stephen Maguire holding my hair back – and four big police officers walking away at the sound of me being sick.

‘The other thing is being doubled over, trying to take my socks off while Steph Twell was sleeping in the room.

‘Written on my hand is: “Go out strong and commit.” The crowd were so intimidating. I don’t mean that to sound bad but yesterday I kind of XXXX myself on the line. So I needed something to take me away from the moment. I embraced it today. I knew they were here for me.

‘It doesn’t feel real. You all know what I’ve been through this year – and even this morning has been a nightmare. This just means so much to me, given the obstacles I’ve overcome.’

Based on what all of the athletes here had done this season, Sharp went into the race knowing that, depending on whether this was a lung-stretching dash or a tactical plod, her very best might – just might – get her a bronze medal. She would certainly have to be somewhere near her peak, though.

Supremely smooth in her first heat, Sharp struggled woefully in Thursday’s semi-final, falling way off the pace on the back straight and needing an all-out sprint over the closing yards just to pinch fourth place – enough to see her into Friday’s final as one of the fastest losers.

Now, loser is not a term that many people would associate with the girl from Edinburgh. Fighter, class act, winner – those are usually the words associated with an athlete who has overcome enormous obstacles just to be here.

Injury and then infection had put qualification in doubt until almost the very last. And Sharp will admit that being almost forgotten during her lengthy absence had acted as a spur.

At this year’s British Championships, she’d railed against the live track commentators who barely gave her a passing mention – and added this slight to others made by pundits paying lavish tributes to certain rivals for overcoming much less traumatic health issues than Sharp herself. Then she went out and beat everyone to claim her second UK title.

There is a school of thought that says Sharp simply likes to have someone or something to kick against. That she isn’t happy without being written off, under-represented or just plain dissed. Whatever makes her run fast, right?

She’d looked decidedly nervous ahead of her semi-final, bouncing on the line and seemingly struggling to maintain her regular focus – she’s not a waver to fans, a gleeful saluter of well-wisher, more a steely-eyed competitor – amid the deafening cheers prompted by her introduction.

On Frday night, Sharp prowled the bend of lane six before the final with a definite intent, pausing only to stretch out those hamstrings one last time. Fine-tuning the instrument that had enable her to reach such heights.

With Jess Judd and Jenny Meadows outside her, Canadian rival Melissa Bishop just one lane inside, she’d at least know exactly what kind of pace was needed right from the off.

The Scot was out quick enough in a race where the world champion clearly decided that pace, pace and more pace was her best hope. This would be all about hanging on the train and then timing the final surge right – while hoping to have the legs to last.

Sixth at the bell, she bided her time. Stayed more restrained than anyone in the crowd. She picked her moment to perfection, charging around the final bend and hitting the home straight flying, overtaking a despairing Nanyondo just on the line.

The daughter of former sprint great Cameron Sharp added: ‘I think I’d have won it if I’d been 100 percent. If someone had said at half two this morning I’d have a silver medal I’d have said: “Yeah, whatever.”

‘Allan Wells came to see me in the village earlier this week and jhe gave me a signed picture of him and my dad.

‘They look like they’re holding hands and he put a really nice message on it, saying to stay focused and determined.

‘I put it up on my wall in the village above my bed. To have people like him here. Seb Coe said I could nick a medal, it means so much to me. These guys are legends.

‘I met my mum and sister on the lap of honour, that’s when I started crying. I was able to pick out people I’d grown up with, peoples parents, my mum’s friends, people I’ grown up with.

‘This is above everything, the year Ive been through I don’t think anything will ever top that.’
