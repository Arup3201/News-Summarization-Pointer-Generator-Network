Three siblings have died after a freight train smashed into their family's SUV just minutes before the beginning of their town's Halloween parade.

The youngsters, aged 18, 13 and 10, were inside the SUV with two other people when a freight train struck them on the tracks on Main Street in Vandalia, Illinois at 6.45pm on Thursday.

Police have said they believe the bars and warning lights at the crossing were functioning properly. 

A witness told XRadio that the SUV apparently backed up to the crossing gate to avoid the train before attempting to move forward again - although it did not get out of the way in time.

Tragic: Three youngsters, aged 18, 13 and 10, were pronounced dead at the scene after a freight train smashed into their SUV which was on the tracks in Vandalia, Illinois on Thursday night

 Injured: Two others, including a 35-year-old driver, were airlifted to hospital following the deadly crash

'We saw the lights were down,' witness Sherrie Small told KMOV. 'It made a terrible noise and then I could see [the train] pick the car up and move it.'

The youngsters have not yet been identified, but authorities have revealed they are an 18-year-old girl, a 13-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl from the same family.

Fayette County Coroner Bruce Bowen pronounced the siblings dead at the scene at 7.16pm.

Two other people inside the car, including the 35-year-old driver, were airlifted to hospital but their conditions are unknown.

Authorities have not released their names or the relation of the children to the other passengers in the car. 

Smash: The freight train apparently struck the passenger's side of the car, killing the three children

Investigation: Authorities said they still need to interview multiple witnesses to determine what happened

Warning signs: Authorities say they believe warning lights and barriers were working at the time

Scene: The crash site - at Sixth Street and Main Street in Vandalia - was just a block from the parade

The crash scene was just a block from the parade, which went ahead as planned.

Police said the event actually helped with their investigation because it kept people away from the scene.

'We still have a lot of witnesses to interview,' Chief Jeff Ray told KTVI. 'We're still trying to gather information to determine what happened.'

An autopsy on the victims is scheduled for Friday and the coroner said the identities of the victims would then be released.
