A three-year-old girl from Hawaii, who suffered brain damage and fell into a coma after having dental work last month, died last night.

Doctors had been unable to revive Finley Boyle, who went into cardiac arrest after allegedly being given the maximum dose of drugs at a dental surgery.

Her mother, Ashley, plans to sue the dentist who was working on her daughter, claiming negligence and dangerous conduct.

Finley Boyle, a 3-year-old Hawaiian 
girl who suffered massive brain damage after undergoing a dental 
procedure last month, died Friday night, her family's lawyer said 
Saturday.

The lawsuit 
against Lilly Geyer and her Island Dentistry for Children practice 
alleges that improper medications with incorrect doses were given to 
Finley on December 3, CNN reported.

Ms
 Boyle was left with the agonizing decision to not resuscitate her 
daughter, saying that although she held out hope that her daughter would
 recover she didn't want her to live in a vegetative state.

'It sounds like she's drowning in my arms,' Ms Boyle had said at a press conference earlier this week.

She had taken Finley to the dentist on December 3 so the three-year-old could have four root canals and 10 cavity fillings.

But when Finley was allegedly given the maximum dosage of drugs, she went into cardiac arrest and couldn't be revived.

In
 the lawsuit, Ms Boyle claimed that Dr Geyer and her associates administered
 too much anesthesia and didn't follow protocol to closely monitor 
Finley's condition.

Ms Boyle is being represented by attorney Richard Fried who called the maximum dosages of five different drugs 'grossly excessive'.

He
 cited the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's standards which 
warned that young children should be monitored every five minutes and that
 an extra person should be there to help in case resuscitation is 
needed.

The procedure on 
December 3 broke both of those rules. Instead of checking Finley's 
oxygen levels every five minutes, records show she wasn't checked for 26 
minutes which explains why the brain damage was so severe.

Innocent: Finley has opened her eyes a few times but has not been responsive, family friends said

When the girl went into cardiac 
arrest, a doctor from another office had to be brought in to perform CPR
 - which Ms Boyle believes is the main reason her daughter fell into a 
coma.

'Had it been initiated at the correct time, she'd be walking out of the hospital right now,' Boyle said.

Finley
 may not have even needed the fillings. Ms Boyle has been contacted by 
others mothers who got second opinions after visiting Dr Geyer and found
 out that her recommendations were 'either totally unnecessary or 
somewhat unnecessary' according to Fried.

Other mothers said their children had trouble walking for a few days after having work done by Dr Geyer

Since Finley went into coma, Dr Geyer has refused to comment to the press. As of Friday, the practice's website says the office is permanently closed.

Finley's case is extremely similar to that of Jahi McMath, the California 13-year-old girl who went brain dead after a tonsillectomy on December 9. Her parents just won the right to keep Jahi alive on a ventilator, after the hospital where she was treated tried to take her off life support.

Ms Boyle decided to go a different route with her daughter, knowing the realities of her daughter's situation from her career as a nurse.

'She is going to be in a bed with pneumonia, getting turned every few hours. Our bodies can live on forever...I'm a quality of life person. She wouldn't want that,' she had said earlier.

'To see her go from a happy health three year old to going through puberty in a diaper, 15 years later is not a choice I was going to make,' she said.

Ms Boyle calls the botched procedure a 'massive tragedy' that she and her family 'will have to deal with for the rest of our lives.'
