This reindeer is clearly not feeling the Christmas spirit.

And as luck would have it, it's even called Rudolph!

Captured on CCTV, the reindeer is caught in the act of destroying Santa's Sleigh at a wildlife park in Nova Scotia Canada.

The naughty reindeer uses its antlers to rip the side off Father's Christmas's sleigh

The footage, shot on a webcam at Shubenacadie Provincial Wildlife Park on Sunday, shows  Rudolph playfully attacking the decorative sleigh put in his paddock.

The webcam 'captured Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer red-handed while demolishing Santa's sleigh. No presents for Rudolph this year!' the filmer later wrote online.

As other reindeer relax nearby, one can't help itself in inspecting Santa's sleigh

Fresh after destroying the sleigh, that appears to have gifts inside, the reindeer scarpers

The animal begins by carefully checking out the sleigh, before fronting up and bending down.

Then with a quick movement, it uses its antlers to rip the side off the gift-giver, before scarpering along with other reindeer in the park. 

Usually it's naughty children who Father Christmas decides will miss out on gifts at Christmas.

But as well as being under threat of being sacked as chief sleigh-puller, this pesky Rudolph will be off Father Christmas's present list this year.
