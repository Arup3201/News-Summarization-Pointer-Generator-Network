A courageous police dog killed in the Tunisian museum hostage siege was given a guard of honour as its body was carried from the scene.

Remarkable footage has emerged showing mass crowds clapping the heroic hound as its bloodied body is wheeled away from the National Bardo museum by special forces. 

The terrorist attack left 17 tourists, a museum security officer, a cleaner, and a police officer dead, as well as the two gunmen.

The German Shepherd, a serving police dog, perished during the gun battle which ended the siege.

The crowd can be heard shouting 'bravo' as the armed officers came away from the scene, who are immediately followed by the dead dog on a trolley.

The gunmen struck at around midday, targeting foreigners as they exited cruise ship buses by the museum in Tunis.

The two terrorists were killed during the siege but a manhunt is underway for any accomplices to today's massacre. 

Thousands of people gathered in the capital on Wednesday night, holding candles or waving the Tunisian flag in a show of solidarity against terrorism.

World leaders pledged their support with Prime Minister David Cameron saying he was 'appalled' by the incident.

Meanwhile, the Foreign Office said it is 'urgently' looking into the attack amid reports Britons may be among the dead.

A spokesman said: We are urgently looking into the serious events in Tunisia and are working with the Tunisian authorities as well as with contacts in the tourist industry to establish if any British nationals have been affected.

'Through our travel advice, we are urging people to exercise caution and follow the instructions of the local authorities.' 

It has not been confirmed who the attackers were, but a video posted online in December attributed to Islamic State, warned the jihadis would target the country.

Twitter accounts associated with the extremist Islamic State group based in Syria and Iraq were described as overjoyed at the attack.

Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid called it a 'cowardly terrorist operation' that targeted tourists.

President Beji Caid Essebsi said in a television statement that 'democracy will win and it will survive,'.

'We will find more ways and equipment for the army to wipe out these barbarous groups for good.'
