Brunette bombshell Georgia Salpa has revealed the curves that catapulted her into FHM's Sexiest Woman In The World 2014 list this week.

The glamour model, who was ranked the sexiest woman in Ireland in the annual list, has been unveiled as the face and body of Alexis Smith lingerie and is pictured lounging around a location house in lace-trimmed styles from the latest collection.

The Greek-born Irish model has replaced TOWIE star Jessica Wright as the face of the brand, which specialises in lingerie designs for petite women with D+ bra size.

Georgia, 28, works hard on her body, often posing selfies at the gym or wearing skimpy sports kit.

Last week, 
Georgia uploaded a snap of herself 
wearing a striped sports bra with a pair of leggings to Instagram.

She wrote: 'Off to body pump class but first lemme take a selfie!! Gym gear is by Sweaty Betty, so comfy...'

Later in the week, she showed off her curves in a teeny 
string bikini by Missoni which retails for around Â£220, writing: 'It's a
 #missonibikini day!!'
