10) Raheem Sterling (Liverpool, £9.8m) - Appears in 22.31% of teams

The England winger is lightning quick and extremely strong for his size, but most importantly he is a threat going forward.

A return of nine goals and five assists last season is likely to be improved again this year, so he is a good choice for your side. 

Young star: Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling costs £9.8m in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game

Popular: Raheem Sterling is 10th on the list - he netted nine goals for Liverpool last season and got five assists

9) Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal, £10.5m) - 22.50%

Many people are labelling Sanchez as the star who can finally turn Arsenal back into serious title contenders, and his record is impressive.

In a wider role for Barcelona last season he scored 19 goals and contributed 10 assists - as the main man at Arsenal, who knows how impressive those figures could become. 

New arrival: Alexis Sanchez signed for Arsenal from Barcelona this summer and can excite the league

Dangerous: Sanchez (left) scored 19 goals and contributed 10 assists in La Liga for Barcelona last year

8) Matty Taylor (Burnley, £3.2m) - 22.95%

Taylor's presence in the top 10 may surprise many but he is a bargain at £3.2m for a player who is likely to play week-in, week-out which itself brings points.

He did not bag any goals or assists as a bit-part player for West Ham United last season, but as a man to put on the bench he is likely to accrue a few points if you are seriously struggling with injuries and suspensions.

Super sub: Burnley's Matty Taylor is cheap and he offers a great option off the bench on Fantasy Football

7) Leighton Baines (Everton, £6.5m) - 24.15%

No surprise at all to see Baines on this list as he is a one of those rare commodities - a defender who scores goal.

The left-back takes penalties and free-kicks, meaning he contributed five goals and four assists last season. Everton keep a lot of clean sheets as well, so there's extra points in the bag. 

Essential: Leighton Baines is a must-have for any good Fantasy side because he scores from defence

6) Diego Costa (Chelsea, £11.0m) - 24.17%

Chelsea's new signing excelled at Atletico Madrid last season, scoring 27 goals as he led the underdogs to the La Liga title.

He is big, powerful and links up well with defenders - he will lead Chelsea's attack and is bound to pick up points as they focal point up front they have been so severely lacking.

Prolific: Chelsea's Diego Costa scored 27 goals in La Liga for champions Atletico Madrid last season

5) Dejan Lovren (Liverpool, £5.2m) - 27.19%

The Croat finally completed his move from Southampton to Liverpool this summer after a protracted transfer, and it is easy to see why they wanted him

Two Man of the Match awards last season, two tackles per games, 2.7 interceptions per game and eight clearances all add up to an impressive defensive rating. Seven yellow cards is a slight blot on the copybook, though he is a centre-back after all. 

Stalwart: Liverpool's Dejan Lovren was extremely solid at the back for Southampton last season

4) Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal, £9.6m) - 28.26%

The 23-year-old had the season of his life last year - before injury cruelly curtailed it - and he netted an amazing 10 goals from midfield in 23 appearances.

Ramsey also added eight assists, three Man of the Match award and was booked just three times - if he stays fit he seems a perfect choice. 

Form: Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey had the season of his life last season before getting injured

Useful: As a midfielder who scores goals - 10 last season - and contributes assists Ramsey is a good buy

3) Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool, £10.4m) - 31.36%

The Liverpool forward is just above Rooney in the price-range for strikers and, after really coming of age last season, he can blossom this campaign as Brendan Rodgers' main man following the departure of Luis Suarez to Barcelona.

He scored an incredible 21 goals - and added seven assists - in just 26 starts last season in the Premier League. If he can stay fit and Liverpool have another good season he will bag you points for fun. 

Main man: Daniel Sturridge is now top dog at Liverpool after Luis Suarez's move to Barcelona this summer

Good return: Sturridge contributed 21 goals and seven assists as Liverpool finished second last season

2) Wayne Rooney (Manchester United, £10.3m) - 32.45%

The new Manchester United captain was always likely to feature on this list, and it is no surprise to see him nestled up in second place.

A price-tag of £10.3m seems good value for a player who scored 17 goals and added 10 assists last season. He is the sixth most expensive striker, yet he has scored 83 Premier League goals in the last four seasons for United.

Yes, his eight bookings last season means he drops a point here and there for his ill-discipline, but he also won seven Man of the Match awards and would be a great option as captain. 

Captain material: New Manchester United skipper Wayne Rooney has made his way on to second on the list

Red Devil: A return of 17 goals and 10 assists last season means Rooney is bound to bring in the points

1) Ross Barkley (Everton, £7.1m) - 32.77%

Everton and England's midfield sensation is a somewhat surprising name to be the most popular pick - although his price makes him a very attractive proposition.

The 20-year-old started 25 league games for Everton last season, and came off the bench on another nine occasions, scoring six goals in the process. He averages an impressive 2.3 shots per game for a midfielder, although with five bookings his disciplinary record is a minor concern.

Barkley is likely to mature further this season and become a key part of Roberto Martinez's side, allowing him to accrue an even greater number of points. At just £7.1m he appears a snippet and that's why a third of all teams have selected him.

Coming of age: Everton's Ross Barkley is a dangerous midfielder who can score goals and contribute assists

Number one: Ross Barkley of Everton is the most-picked player in this season's MailOnline Fantasy Football
