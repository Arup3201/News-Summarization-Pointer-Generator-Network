An Italian supercar owner fled the scene of an accident because he couldn't bear the sight of his crumpled Ferrari after he smashed into a skip.

Gabino Gamez González, 45, told police that he was so dazed by crashing £150,000 his cherry red Ferrari 458 in the capital Madrid that he just walked off.

Mr González told local media: 'I had always wanted one of the cars and it was my pride and joy even though it cost me an arm and a leg.

'But when I saw that it was a wreck after ploughing against a skip filled with builders rubble, I was in shock. I just couldn't take it in, and I remember just walking off saying to myself 'no no, it can't be true'.'

The airbags in the car had been activated and eyewitnesses told police it seemed as if the driver was in a daze when they saw him clutching his head as he staggered off.

Police said that the 562 horse power car had apparently been travelling too fast when it skidded and ploughed into the skip, leaving the car with a write-off.

The 458 model was famous because it was co-designed by Michael Schumacher.

Police admitted that they suspected the man had been drunk because he fled the scene of the accident but when he was discovered a short while later a breath test apparently proved negative.

He still faces charges though of driving too fast, but police are currently waiting for a scene of the accident report from their traffic department.
