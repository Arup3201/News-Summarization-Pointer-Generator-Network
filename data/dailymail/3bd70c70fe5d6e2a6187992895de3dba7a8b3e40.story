He's been taking on a greater Royal role since leaving his full time job with the RAF in September, juggling the early days of fatherhood with stepping up his official duties as second in line to the throne.

And the Duke of Cambridge was at the fore once again yesterday as he helped represent the Queen as the first female president of South Korea began a state visit to the UK.

Prince William accompanied President Park Geun-hye to a ground-breaking ceremony for a new Korean War Memorial to be built in central London to commemorate the 1,000 British service personnel who died during the Korean War in the 1950s.

After the ceremony, Prince William 
met veterans of the conflict, which ran from June 1950 to July 1953 with
 Britain providing more than 90,000 troops in support of the United 
Nations-backed South Korea.

He
 and President park were shown a scale model of the proposed memorial, 
which will stand in the Victoria Embankment Gardens, and observed a 
minute's silence in honour of those killed.

President
 Park, 61, cut the first turf and unveiled a scale model of the 18ft 
Portland stone memorial, which will feature a bronze statue by sculptor 
Philip Jackson of a British soldier.

It is Britain's first memorial to the war which ended 60 years ago.

Prince
 William's presence was only the second time he has been involved in an 
official state visit - he and the Duchess of Cambridge met Barack Obama 
and wife Michelle on their visit to the UK back in 2011.

Friendly: The Duke of Cambridge shares a joke with one of the veterans who was there for today's groundbreaking ceremony

Greeting: Prince William shakes hands with one of the veterans at yesterday's ceremony as others take photographs

It
 is the latest sign that William is taking on a more pronounced role at 
the forefront of the Royal family. Last month he represented the Queen 
when he performed his first investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace.

Park
 Geun-hye had earlier been greeted with warm smiles by the Queen, and 
appeared to share a joke with the Duke of Edinburgh, as she arrived at 
Horse Guards Parade.

President
 Park, who is staying at Buckingham Palace for the duration of her 
three-day visit, was introduced to dignitaries on the royal podium by 
the Queen - who was in a rose-coloured silk and wool dress and coat by 
Karl Ludwig, with a matching Angela Kelly hat.

The
 pair also smiled as they chatted at a state banquet held to herald the 
South Korean president's arrival at Buckingham Palace last night.

Both women beamed as they toasted President Park's visit.

The president, who wore grey trousers and a dark purple coat, shook hands with Prime Minister David Cameron, Foreign Secretary William Hague and Home Secretary Theresa May - who had donned a brightly-coloured coat with a geometric pattern for the occasion.

A 41-gun salute was fired in nearby Green Park by The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery, and also at the Tower of London by The Honourable Artillery Company, to mark the arrival of the president - who was sworn in on February 25 this year.

After the Korean national anthem was played by the Band of the Welsh Guards, President Park inspected the guard of honour provided by 1st Battalion Welsh Guards with the Duke of Edinburgh - who gallantly pointed out a large puddle she ought to avoid as they walked from the dais.

Park Geun-hye was greeted with warm smiles by the Queen, and full pomp and pageantry today as she began a state visit to the UK

The president joined the monarch and the Duke of Edinburgh in a state carriage procession to Buckingham Palace, with the trio taking the Australian state coach

The president then joined the monarch and the Duke of Edinburgh in a state carriage procession to Buckingham Palace, with the trio taking the Australian state coach.

The Duke of York, who had earlier accompanied the president to the ceremony, followed in the Scottish state coach. Crowds lined The Mall to cheer the procession as it made its way to the palace.

Concern over North Korea’s growing nuclear capability has increased in the past year after it carried out its third nuclear test in February, prompting the UN to approve fresh sanctions against Pyongyang.

The president shook hands with Prime Minister David Cameron, Foreign Secretary William Hague and Mrs May, as crowds looked on

Ms Park took office just days after North Korea’s third test and has promised to revamp the Korean economy and enact a 'trust-building' process with the North.

The 61-year-old president is the daughter of former president Park Chung-hee, who ruled South Korea for almost two decades after seizing power in a military coup in 1961.

At the age of just 22, Ms Park became South Korea’s first lady when her mother was shot dead in 1974 - murdered by a North Korean gunman.

The Queen and Philip paid a state visit to South Korea in 1999, while the last leader from the country to make a state visit to the UK was Roh Moo-hyun in 2004.

One of the artifacts on display had clearly caught the eye of the Duke of Edinburgh as the party made their way through the gallery

The Picture Gallery has always served as one of the Palace's principal rooms for official entertaining. During the State Visit Ms Park will also attend a state banquet and visit Downing Street

Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh looked interested to see the items on display

In a typically good humoured gesture Prince Philip appears to tweak the nose of a mask in the Picture Gallery - which he visited alongside the president, following lunch at Buckingham Palace
