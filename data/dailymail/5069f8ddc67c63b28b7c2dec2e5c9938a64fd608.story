If you’ve ever visited New York City then it’s likely you had to put up with a noisy TV in the back of a cab as you made your way somewhere.

But that could all change soon as a private company has proposed removing the current screens and replacing them with Apple iPad tablets.

The screens were installed in 2007 and play local news and adverts, but the proposal from Square in San Francisco, California, could change that.

‘It’s all the same garbage over and over,’ taxi driver Orlando Morales told the New York Post. ‘It drives me nuts listening to this s**t.’

The bid and proposal for a pilot of 50 tablet computers in city cabs is being heard by the Taxi and Limousine Commission next Thursday.

A survey last February revealed 31 per cent of passengers think current screens, which also feature local maps, are the worst part of a cab ride.

Taxi drivers would not only benefit from
less noise, but also pay less commission when passengers use their 
credit cards to cover a journey.

The cabbies currently pay five per cent but this would drop to 2.75 per cent if the deal with Square goes through, reported the New York Post.

Taxi driver Amrit Singh said this is ‘one of the best things they can do for us right now’ and would save him a whopping $2,000 a year.

‘Now I can give that money to my kids,’ Mr Singh, 51, told the New York Post. ‘And we really need that. It would be a great help.’

Square is considering which apps and games to make available to passengers, some of whom say the whole thing is a huge waste of money.

But a spokesman for the company told the New York Post its system is ‘simple’, ‘cost-effective’ and ‘meets the specific needs of NYC taxi drivers’.
