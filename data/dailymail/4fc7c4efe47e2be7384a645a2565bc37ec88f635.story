Creative subjects are being squeezed out of schools due to the government's new league table measure.

Headteachers are pushing pupils to take more GCSEs in English Baccalaureate subjects, according to experts.

From next year, the government's Progress 8 league table measure will replace the five A* to C benchmark. Failure to meet the target could leave schools at risk of takeover or even closure.

Students' performance will be tracked in eight subjects split into three groups: English and maths, which will be given double weighting; three EBac subjects (sciences, computer science, geography, history and languages) and three optional subjects.

But the Design and Technology Association (DATA) has warned that schools are urging students to take further EBac subjects as 'optional subjects', leaving them less time to pursue creative interests.

DATA chief executive, Richard Green, told the Times Educational Supplement: 'If a student is doing history then (schools) are advising them to take geography as well, and the same with sciences and languages.

'That then uses up the option categories, so you have all the other subjects competing for just one slot.'

The National Society for Education in Art and Design said it was also aware of creative subjects being affected.
