MPs have been banned from mentioning the name of David Cameron’s former director of communications Andy Coulson in the run-up to his trial for phone-hacking.

The unusual action was taken by the Solicitor General after a series of heated exchanges in the Commons during which Labour MPs made disparaging remarks about the former News of The World editor.

The move was made to avoid MPs’ comments prejudicing the outcome of the case.

Mr Coulson, who quit his Downing Street job in January 2011, will appear in the dock of the Old Bailey in just over a week.

He will face trial alongside former newspaper editor Rebekah Brooks.

Brooks, 44, ex-editor of The Sun and the now defunct News of the World, and Coulson, another former News of the World editor, heard at the Old Bailey last year that they would face trial.

Appearing alongside them were The Sun’s former chief reporter John Kay, 69, ex News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman, 55, and Ministry of Defence official Bettina Jordan Barber, 39, also facing charges linked to Scotland Yard’s Operation Elveden investigation.

Coulson, who was NotW editor from 2003 to 2007, and Brooks, who edited the paper from 2000 to 2003 before moving to edit The Sun and then becoming chief executive officer of the two papers’ parent group News International, are accused along with the other journalists of conspiracy to unlawfully intercept communications.

The charges relate to an alleged attempt to hide evidence from police investigating phone hacking claims and illegal payments to public officials by the News of the World and The Sun.

In a separate case Brooks, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, along with her 
husband, Charlie, plus five others are accused of perverting the course 
of justice.
