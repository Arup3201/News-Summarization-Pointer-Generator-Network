The first stealth drone developed in Europe has made its first flight from a test base in France.

The 'Neuron' drone has been built by researchers in France, Spain, Italy, Greece, Sweden and Switzerland, and has been in development for five years.

Today, the first flight was able to take off from Dassault Aviation company's base in Istres, France.

The craft, Europe's first unmanned stealth drone, could eventually carry precision weapons

Further tests of the craft will be carried out in Sweden and Italy, where its weapons and stealth capabilities will be tested

The craft is 10 meters long, has a wingspan of about 12.5 meters and weighs five tons without weapons.

It is powered by a Rolls-Royce 
Turbomeca 'Adour' engine, and will carry precision missiles controlled 
remotely by a human operator.

The craft will act as a testbed for new technologies, and is unlikely to be produced in its current form, acting instead as a prototype.

The large craft is 10 meters long, has a wingspan of about 12.5 meters and weighs five tons without weapons.

It is powered by a Rolls-Royce Turbomeca 'Adour' engine, and will carry precision missiles controlled remotely by a human operator.

'Today, the nEUROn, Europe’s unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) stealth technology demonstrator, successfully completed its maiden flight from the Dassault Aviation company’s flight test base in Istres, in collaboration with the flight test personnel of the French defense procurement agency (DGA),' said Dassault Aviation.

'The nEUROn will continue to undergo testing in France until 2014, at which time it will be sent to Vidsel in Sweden for a series of operational trials.

'It will then go to the Perdadesfogu range (Italy) for further tests, in particular firing and stealth measurements.'
