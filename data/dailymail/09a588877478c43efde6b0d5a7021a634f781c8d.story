English MPs could be given the power to veto laws affecting only England, it emerged last night.

Under plans to be unveiled in the autumn, English MPs would be able to reject legislation on NHS, education or local government reforms even if it had been passed by a majority of all MPs in the Commons.

The move is designed to end the situation under which Scottish MPs can be used to force through laws that only concern England, against the wishes of English MPs.

The changes are likely to be fiercely resisted by Labour. Many of its MPs represent Scottish and Welsh constituencies and even if the party wins the general election it might not command a majority of MPs in England.

At present, 67 of Labour’s 257 MPs represent Welsh or Scottish constituencies. The Tories have a notional majority of 68 over other parties with English MPs.

The plans are being drawn up by Oliver Letwin, the Tory Cabinet Office Minister, and Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

The proposal favoured by ministers from 
both parties would see legislation taking its usual course through the 
Commons and the Lords.

However, once a Bill has had its third reading in both houses, English MPs would be given a vote to ratify the legislation on policy areas that only affect England.

If they rejected part or all of a piece of legislation, it would return to the House of Commons for further consultation or amendment.

The reforms will form part of a package of constitutional changes that will also include plans to devolve further tax and borrowing powers to the Welsh Assembly.

A senior minister told the Mail: ‘The idea is to give English MPs the right to ratify legislation that concerns England. It would effectively create a “fourth reading” of a bill on English-only matters.

‘Scotland has had devolution and is now voting on independence. Wales is going to get more powers. It would be wrong not to address the issue of England, too.’

The plans are a bid to solve the so-called ‘West Lothian Question’, named after the former Labour MP for West Lothian Tam Dalyell, who raised the issue of English MPs being overruled by Scots in a speech on devolution in 1977.
