Cristiano Ronaldo continues to reel in the honours due to his prolific goalscoring form.

His latest accolade comes from the International Federation of Football History and Statistics after he fired 69 goals in all competitions for Real Madrid and Portugal to be the highest goalscorer of 2013.

The 29-year-old received his latest award on Thursday, and swiftly shared his delight with his Instagram followers.

The attacker is currently spearheading Real's record breaking winning streak. 

They reset a club record of 15 straight wins with a 2-1 victory over Malaga last weekend and could extend their run to 18 with a home victory over Celta Vigo on Saturday.
