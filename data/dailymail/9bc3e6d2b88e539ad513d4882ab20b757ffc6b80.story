Paul Swann has been jailed for 12 weeks for fraud after pretending he had cancer and was raising money for a local hospice

A conman who pocketed thousands of pounds worth of donations for a hospice after pretending he was dying of cancer has been jailed.

Paul Swann even told his family and friends he was terminally ill in a bid to swindle them out of money.

He organised a 'charity event' which he said was for St Catherine's Hospice in his home city of Preston, Lancashire to get more cash.

The 46-year-old was jailed for 12 weeks this week after magistrates heard he 'abused the generosity of unsuspecting strangers for his own selfish gain'.

The fraudster made £500 from those he invited to his 'hospice charity night' and a further £2,000 from the Professional Footballers' Association after they heard about his supposed plight, Preston Magistrates Court heard.

Prosecutor Elliott Taylforth said: 'Paul Swann cruelly deceived his family and friends by fabricating a fake terminal illness.

'Once he had gained their sympathy, his deceit escalated as he organised a fundraising event at a local social club, pulling on the heart strings of members of the public to donate their hard-earned money to the cause.

'He pocketed the money plus took a large donation from a charity for his own selfish gain. The offences Swann committed are far from victimless crimes.'

Stephen Greenhalgh, chief executive of the hospice whose name was used by Swann, said: 'St Catherine's Hospice has been left shocked and saddened by the actions of Paul Swann, who has defrauded local people of important funds which were so generously given.

'As a charity and organisation supporting people who are facing the true reality of life with serious illness, we find the manner of his deception particularly heartless.

'In the current economic climate, the charity is finding it very difficult to raise money to fund our specialised care and support for patients and their loved ones at the time they need it most.

'Unfortunately, situations like this affect public confidence and can make fundraising even harder.

'We do all that we can to prevent fraudulent activity, which is why we brought this matter to the attention of the police. Fortunately situations like this are few and far between.'

Swann admitted two offences of fraud by false representation, which took place between January and June this year and March and June this year.

Preston Magistrates court heard Swann 'abused the generosity of unsuspecting strangers for his own  gain'
