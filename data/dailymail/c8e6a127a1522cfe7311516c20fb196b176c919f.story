Primary school exams are to be simplified to accommodate pupils who do not speak English as their first language, the exam regulator Ofqual has ruled. 

Tests sat by 11-year-olds should be constructed with larger fonts and shorter sentences with fewer verbs.

The changes are to be made because some pupils ‘may not understand some of the words or phrases used in an exam or assessment’.

'Dumbed down': Exams in English primary school pupils are to be 
simplified to accommodate children who speak English as a 
second language

In order to accommodate students who speak English as their second laguage, are colourblind or have learning disabilities, Ofqual is instructing exam writers to ‘dumb down’ exams, the Daily Telegraph reports.

The regulating body provides a list of the 1,000 most commonly used English words, instructing test providers to use them.

It advised that using complex language could pose a problem for ‘inexperienced readers’ sitting Sats tests in primary schools in England.

This has led to accusations that the watchdog is insulting bilingual children and that the guide will lead to a drop in exam standards.

‘There should always be provision for children who speak English as a second language but there is no need to dumb down the exam terminology,’ Chris McGovern, a former head teacher and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, told The Daily Telegraph. ‘It is an insult to these children.’

Problem: The guide states that complex words and sentence structures could make exams unnecessarily difficult for 'inexperienced readers'

‘A lot of them are very bright, motivated and better at English than native speakers – and they won’t want to be sitting an exam that’s been skewed for their sake. It represents an erosion of exam standards.’

Ofqual defended the guide, saying it was not specifically for pupils who spoke a foreign language, but that the changes would give all pupils an equal chance to show their level of knowledge and understanding of a subject.

Easier: The guide instructs test writers to use a limited number of verbs per sentence

‘The guidance, which was developed in partnership with subject and assessment experts, aims to help achieve this, as well as making sure that questions properly assess the skills and abilities they are designed to test,’ a spokesperson said.

The 30-page guide suggests that test designers should ‘present information in short sentences’ and ‘use simple sentence structures with a logical conceptual flow (subject, verb, object)’.

It instructs examiners to ‘avoid subordinate clauses’ and discourages them from using complicated sentences such as: ‘The man who was driving the car was in a hurry’ as it contains a lot of condensed information, and should be written as: ‘The man was driving the car. He was in a hurry.’

It encourages ‘simple, active sentences such as subject-verb-object (SVO)’ in favour of passive sentences and also advices test designers to avoid using more than 65 characters in one line.

Ofqual also recommends an appropriate font size to be 'between 10pt and 15pt’ and to use ‘underlining, bold, italics, boxes, indentation and shading consistently,’ to make exams easier to read.

The watchdog concluded: that ‘test developers and designers need to understand the principles explored in this document if they are to produce “fair access by design” for all pupils.’
