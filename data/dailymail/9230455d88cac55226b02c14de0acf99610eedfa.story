Gloating: Ask.fm has proudly revealed a surge in numbers since the suicide of Hannah Smith, who blamed bullies on the site

The shameless website blamed for allowing trolls to drive teenager Hannah Smith to suicide has bragged about how it has had a record number of users.

The 14-year-old's father David Smith today called Ask.fm 'heartless b*******' after the Latvian-based social network exclaimed millions more had signed up since his daughter's death ten days ago.

Mr Smith said it was like they were 'dancing on Hannah's grave'.

The site, which David Cameron called 'vile' and demanded people boycott, tweeted yesterday: 'Ask.hits 70million registered users'.

Hannah hanged herself on Friday, August 2, after anonymous bullies on the site told her to 'go die', 'drink bleach' and 'get cancer'.

Her father told the Daily Mirror: ''It just proves what a heartless bunch of b******* the people that run the site are.

'It should be shut down, but instead they're boasting about the numbers of hits and members they've had - and all the while, the Government is doing nothing.'

Ask.fm claimed yesterday it has 70million users, but six weeks ago it tweeted it had 60million users.

Based on those figures it makes £6million a year on advertising, although last week some of Britain's biggest businesses started pulling out because of its image as a place for anonymous bullying.

It came just 48 hours after the website's bosses claimed the teenager sent most of the vile abuse to herself.

It was reported the social networking site insists that she set up most of the anonymous identities used to bombard her own page.

A source at the firm based in Riga, Latvia, said: ‘With the Hannah case, the company have looked at every identity – the [computer] IP addresses are trackable. She posted the anonymous things herself.’Scroll down for video

Boast: The Ask.fm Twitter account rarely tweets but yesterday it revealed a huge rise in users - 10m more in six weeks

Upsetting: Hannah Smith and her father Dave when she was a baby and and as a teenager, and he said today Ask.fm were 'dancing on her grave'

Ask.fm allows users to ask questions or invite them from other members but they can remain anonymous, allowing trolls to pick out victims.

Mr Smith, a lorry driver from Lutterworth, Leicestershire, added that the issue was not if Hannah had sent any of the messages.

‘She was bullied online,’ he said. ‘If Hannah did do some of it herself, then it just shows how desperate she was.’ 

Mr Smith said Ask.fm should be working to stop the abuse instead of deflecting blame for Hannah’s death.

‘Ask.fm has information to say that Hannah was being bullied but they have not passed on that  information,’ he said. ‘They are  trying to discredit a 14-year-old girl who has committed suicide.

‘They have not once been in touch with me. Hannah has touched a lot of hearts. But they are trying to  discredit her because this company was making millions.’

Tragic Hannah, 14, from Lutterworth, 
Leicestershire, was found hanged in her bedroom after 
suffering months of abuse by bullies on the social network Ask.fm

internal investigation is said to have revealed that 98 per cent of the 
messages were sent from a computer with the same IP address as Hannah's

Row: Ask.fm has said previously it does not take responsibility for what is on its site and does not monitor posts

A 16-year-old boy from Belgium has been identified as the troll who sent taunts to Hannah the day before she died. Mr Smith told the Daily Mail he had seen evidence the teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was targeting his daughter.

He wrote: 'This is so srs (serious) i think i might go to jail.

'you
no that girl that's all over the news and s**t... hannah!? The day 
before she died i was sending her a load of abuse get cancer kill 
yourself e.t.c i didn't think it would go this far.'

But he maintained that identifying him would not protect other children as only regulating the internet would be effective.

‘Catching this boy won’t make any difference, it won’t make the internet safer,’ he said. ‘The only way is to bring in controls.’

Leicestershire Police are analysing Hannah’s computer and said they would consider charges if any offence was uncovered.

A spokesman said: ‘Hannah’s death is not being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for the coroner.’
