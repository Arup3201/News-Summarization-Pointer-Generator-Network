A seaside resort is expecting to be hit by swarms of treasure hunters after an artist buried 30 pieces of gold bullion on a beach - worth £10,000.

German artist Michael Sailstorfer has hidden the 24-carat gold bars on the Outer Harbour beach in Folkestone, on the Kent coast, as part of the town's arts festival.

Although the celebrations don't start until Saturday, Mr Sailstorfer told people to start looking for the gold bricks from 4pm today - because they can keep what they find.

Dozens of people descended upon the beach as soon as the tide withdrew at 4pm this afternoon 

The 10g and 20g gold bars, pictured, have been buried in the Outer Harbour beach in Folkestone 

The bricks, of different sizes, have been hidden underneath the sands on the beach by the artist, who is expecting thousands of would-be treasure hunters to show up with their bucket and spade and start searching.

The installation, entitled 'Folkestone Digs', is funded by Bristol-based designers Situations.

Director Claire Doherty said: 'So often public art funding is spent on a static sculpture or a bauble on a roundabout and part of what we do is to say, actually sometimes a temporary project can have as much impact in the collective memory as something that has been there a long time.'

Among those looking to recover part of the £10,000 fortune were families visiting the area

Festival organiser Lewis Biggs added: 'I think we might well have a lot of people.

German artist Michael Sailstorfer buried the gold nuggets on the beach in advance of the festival 

'It's a participatory artwork, about people coming to the beach and digging and possibly finding hidden treasure.

'Some people will get lucky, some people will not get lucky. That's life.' 

The beach where the gold is buried is only accessible at low tide, meaning treasure-hunters only have a small window each day in which to find their fortune.

Within half an hour of the sands being exposed by the dropping tide, around 150 eager diggers had crammed onto the small beach, hoping to get lucky. 

The promise of gold, split into 10g and 20g bars, is expected to bring thousands of people to the beach over the coming days.

The shifting tides means that searching was only possible until 9pm this evening.

At this time of year, the tide is out on the beach from 6am to 11:30am and from 4pm to 9pm.

Berlin-based Michael Sailstorfer, 35, has made a reputation for himself for staging elaborate productions, including gluing every leaf back onto a tree in the depths of winter, and slowly burning a log cabin on a stove until only the metal was left.

Treasure hunters took different approaches in seeking their fortune with some more determined than others

More than 150 people tried their luck today searching for the secretly buried 10g and 20g gold bars
