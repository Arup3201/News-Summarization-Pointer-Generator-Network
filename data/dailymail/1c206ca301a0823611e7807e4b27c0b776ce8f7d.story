A homeless woman has come forward to add more confusion to the Robert Allenby saga, claiming she discovered the Australian golfer just one block away from the bar he says he was abducted from in Hawaii - not 10km away as he said immediately after the ordeal.

Allenby said he was thrown in the boot of a car and woke up in a park on Sunday morning some 10km away from the Amuse Wine Bar in Honolulu where he had been drinking with friends before he was attacked.

But the unnamed woman, who has spoken with police, told Channel Nine News that she stumbled across a 'bloodied and confused' Allenby in a park just a block away  where he was arguing with two homeless men.

She alleged Allenby asked her to use his one remaining credit card to withdraw $500 so he could pay the two men to give him back his wallet.

The woman told Nine News the men started to become 'quite aggressive' before a man, described as a former soldier, intervened and helped Allenby into a cab back to his hotel.

It comes as Honolulu police reviewed CCTV footage from the wine bar showing Allenby leaving with two men and a woman before he was attacked. 

Police also have footage of a suspect using Allenby's credit card in Waikiki to purchase two bottles of alcohol, according to Channel Nine.

Allenby had been having dinner and drinks with friends, including his caddie Mick Middlemo, who says there's 'no doubt' the golfer's drink had been spiked, the Daily Telegraph reports.

Middlemo said he left the bar at 10.30pm and Allenby wasn't 'hammered'. The golfer paid a drink bill at 10.48pm and then went to the toilet. 

'Later (on CCTV) you can see him come out of the bathroom looking like he's had 400 drinks. He didn't get that drunk in 20 minutes,' Middlemo said. 

The pair had been dining with friend Anthony Puntoriero and another person. 

Punteriero called Middlemo after noticing the golfer was missing about 11pm - the pair thought he had just gone back to the hotel room. 

CCTV footage showed Allenby leaving with two men and a woman before he says he was bashed and knocked unconscious. 

Allenby only remembers paying the bill and coming out of the bathroom where he was notified Puntoriero had already gone downstairs.  

He said he had no recollection of his time spent in the boot as he had been knocked unconscious.

Australian golfer Robert Allenby was kidnapped from a bar, robbed and beaten up in Hawaii

LIam Neeson: In the movie Taken, Neeson stars as a former spy desperate to save his daughter who had been sold off into sex slavery

The Australian golfer has compared his experience with the action film Taken.

'I've watched Taken quite a few times. It kind of felt pretty much the same as that. Just very surreal, yeah,' he said. 

The thriller flick features Liam Neeson playing a former spy who is trying to track down his biological daughter, who has been sold into sex slavery.

In an interview with the Seven Network on Monday morning, a battered and bruised Robert Allenby said the FBI are investigating the alleged incident. 

But the FBI denies that. 

'The FBI is not investigating this matter whatsoever,' FBI Special Agent Tom Simon told Daily Mail Australia on Monday morning.

'A little bit of an American civics lesson - the FBI could only investigate a kidnapping if the victim was transferred interstate.' 

But Mr Simon said he did not believe Allenby was lying about FBI involvement.

'I don't believe the golfer was lying. Here's what the confusion arose from. 

'The head of security for the PGA in Hawaii who I believe spoke to the alleged victim is a retired FBI special agent. 

'So I believe it was from that conversation that the golfer came to the erroneous but not illogical conclusion the FBI was looking into this field.  

Allenby, 43, was in the country playing the Sony Open but missed the cut on Friday

The four-time PGA Tour winner paid special tribute to the homeless woman who helped him as he was starting to be harassed by other homeless people after being dumped out of the car.

Born: 12 July, 1971

Turned pro: 1992

Joined PGA Tour: 1999

Best major results: Equal seventh, U.S. Open (2004), The Open Championship (2008)

Best Australian PGA result:2005 'triple crown', winning the Australian Masters, Open and PGA

Earnings: Allenby is 27th on the all-time list for the PGA Tour with $27,329,892 

The homeless woman got the bruised and beaten golfer away from the others, before a retired military officer also came to his aid.

'I was very fortunate, a homeless lady pretty much saved my life,' Allenby said.

Scans have cleared Allenby of any serious facial or head injuries and he is hopeful of being cleared to fly in the next day or two.

He doesn't yet know when he'll next hit the golf course.

'The chances of me playing next week are very slim, but I'm just taking it one day at a time.' 

'Medically, I thankfully didn't suffer anything major beyond some bumps and bruises that will take a bit of time to heal,' Allenby said in a statement released by the PGA Tour on Sunday.

The Australian failed to make the cut after the first two days of play and was relaxing on Friday night

'My plan currently is to fly back to the mainland and at that point, evaluate my ability to play next week at the Humana Challenge.

'Whatever the outcome regarding my ability to play next week, I anticipate a successful rest of the 2014-15 PGA Tour season.'

Allenby has noticeable damage and lacerations to his nose and forehead. He has told reporters the FBI and local police have some leads.  

Middlemo had been with Allenby earlier in the night

'We have some names and numbers and they have some leads to follow up, so I am confident they will get the guys,' Allenby said.

'With the FBI guys involved, they're the best, the guys on the tour are awesome, and they'll get to the bottom of it.' 

Allenby was most concerned about potentially not being able to call 13-year-old daughter Lily for her birthday, but scans have cleared him of any serious facial or head injuries and he is hopeful of being cleared to fly in the next day or two.

'She's really upset about it but at the end of the day it could have been a lot worse,' the Victorian said.

'I don't care about the money or my cards or anything like that. I am just glad I have survived this one.' 

After the incident, the Australian golfer was then returned to the Kahala Hotel where he had spent the week while playing at the Sony Open held at the nearby Waialae Country Club - where Allenby failed to make the cut after the first two days of play.

His friend Anthony Puntoriero - who was with Allenby earlier on the night - confirmed he was kidnapped. 

'He's all right now but we are still talking to detectives,' Puntoriero told AAP.

Allenby was set to head back to the US on Saturday morning, but has stayed on to assist police with their investigations.

The 43-year-old has been a professional golfer since 1992, and while a consistent performer on the PGA Tour for 15 years he has never won a major tournament.

Allenby's best result at a major was to finish equal seventh - which he achieved twice - at the 2004 U.S. Open and the 2008 Open Championship.

He won Australia's 'triple crown' in 2005 - winning the Masters, Australian PGA and Australian Open.

He's also been a regular in the Presidents Cup, representing the International team five times between 1993 and 2009. 

The Melbourne-born golfer now lives in the U.S. full time, in Jupiter, Florida.
