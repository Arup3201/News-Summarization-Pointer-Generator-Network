An award-winning reporter has revealed how he fantasized about killing a former neighbour who had brutally raped him when he was seven.

David Holthouse, 41, meticulously planned the murder and how he would get away with it - until his mother came across his childhood diary and revealed she finally knew about the abuse.

Holthouse said at that point he was forced to give up on the killing as his motive for murder was revealed - so he enacted a different type of revenge: Publishing a story about the violent attack.

He first shared the story about his desire for revenge in a 2004 article for theÂ Denver Westword, and it was featured on This American Life. The story is now being turned into a play in New York.

Struggle: David Holthouse has revealed how he was 'obsessed' with murdering his rapist 10 years ago

Speaking to ABC News, Holthouse said that murdering the man had just 'felt like the right thing to do'.

'I arrived at a point in my mind where it seemed to me that murder was entirely 
rational, justifiable and even a morally responsible course of action,' he said.

Innocent: He was just seven (pictured) when he was raped by the family friend, who was 17

He recalled how he was abused when his family lived in Anchorage, Alaska and were having dinner with their best friends, who had a son - a high school football player - ten years older than Holthouse.

One night in 1978, the parents were chatting and drinking wine, when the 17-year-old took David to his room in the basement, saying he would teach him some karate moves.

But the older boy soon backed him into a corner, where Holthouse fell to his knees.

At that point, the teenager forced him to give him oral sex before pushing the young boy to his bed.

Holthouse sobbed through the pain, not knowing what had happened. The older boy told him never to tell anyone about the attack.

'Part of it was I didn't really have a 
firm concept of what had happened,' he told ABC. 'Nobody ever 
talked to me about sex or rape... I didn't have the words 
to apply to it... It was easier to keep quiet.'

In the following years, the older boy taunted him, grabbing his crotch when Holthouse was around as if he would attack him again.

As he researched rape as a teenager, 
he learned about the cycle of abuse and feared he would become a 
pedophile. He decided to kill himself if he ever felt those feelings 
emerge.

Attacker: He said he looked up to the football star, who he has never named, but was left in fear of him

'I felt like a werewolf had bitten me and it was only a matter of time before the full moon rose,' he wrote in his article.

Following
 college, Holthouse became a reporter and the job sent him across the 
country before he eventually reached Denver, Colorado.

His
 mother revealed that the man - who she did not know had raped her son -
 was living there too with his wife and children. Holthouse feared he 
could be victimising them and knew he had to stop it.

He
 began stalking the man and learning his habits and routes. He bought an
 untraceable gun and planned to shoot him in the crotch and then the 
head during one of the man's late-night walks.

Confused: Holthouse, with his mother, said he did not understand what had happened and told no one

Suffering in silence: It meant he believed he could get away with killing the man without becoming a suspect. Holthouse, pictured as a child, decided to murder the man when he learned he had moved nearby

Holthouse reasoned that because never told anyone about the abuse 'there was nothing in recent history to connect me to him,' and he would not be caught.

But just ten days after buying the gun, he received a call from his mother. She had found his childhood diary and read about his horrific rape, which he had written about when he was 11.

'I know now that what he did to me is rape,' the entry wrote. 'I wonder what will happen when I grow up and see him when I am grown up. Will I smile and shake his hand and pretend nothing happened? Or will I punch him in the face?

His mother immediately wrote to the family telling them that their son was a monster, and Holthouse said he was forced to call off the murder because he now had a motive.

Sadness: But his mother called him after she found a childhood diary where he had written about the rape

But the following year, he wrote to his attacker and said they should meet. 'I don't want your blood or your money,' he wrote. 'Just one uncomfortable conversation.'

The rapist agreed to meet him and Holthouse went armed with a gun and a tape recorder. The man told Holthouse that he had been his only victim.

'I've thought 100 times about contacting 
you in the last 20 years to tell you that, and I just never had the 
courage to pick up the phone,' he said as they met. 'I'm sorry for the pain I've caused you and
 my parents and your parents.'

Holthouse, who had been writing a story about his ordeal, decided that there was a chance the man was telling the truth, so he decided not to print his name.

When the story was printed and aired 
on This American Life, rape victims from across the country contacted 
him to thank him. It was also heard by the artistic director of 
NewYorkRep, Markus Potter.

Exposed: He wrote the story for his paper and it is now becoming an off Broadway play in New York

'I
 just happened to be listening to a This American Life podcast and I 
stopped in my tracks, kind of paralyzed,' he told ABC. 'Immediately, I thought this story needs to be told.'

Holthouse, who is now married with a son, said he would encourage any other rape victims to enact their revenge.

'Not only do you have the right,' he said, but arguably, you have the obligation to exact some form of 
revenge on the person who sexually assaulted you when you were a kid.

'You have that same special, critical knowledge that I had. You 
know, beyond any doubt, the identity of a kiddie rapist.'
