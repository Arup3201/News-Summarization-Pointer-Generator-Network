Yahoo is shutting down its research and development centre in Beijing - the firm's only physical presence in the country.

The company confirmed the plans on Wednesday and the move is expected to affect between 200 and 300 employees.  

Yahoo said in a statement that it is 'consolidating certain functions into fewer offices' and is 'constantly making changes to realign resources.'  

Yahoo is pulling the plug on its research and development centre in Haidan, Beijing - the firm's only physical presence in the country. The California-based company confirmed the plans on Wednesday and the move is expected to affect between 200 and 300 employees

Employees were informed of the closures yesterday. 

According to reports in Bloomberg, this is said to be around two per cent of its global workforce and follows editorial job cuts in Canada earlier this month. 

It has also recently closed offices in Amman and Jordan. 

Yahoo was once the leading search engine but has lost ground to Google and more recently Microsoft's Bing. 

Mozilla announced in December it was ending its partnership with Google as the default option for Firefox web searches. 

At the start of the year it began switching people using the browser in the US  to Yahoo.

The decision to switch to Yahoo came as a decade-long agreement with Google neared its end, and Mozilla 'evaluated its options', according to the firm.

The partnership with Yahoo is set to last five years.

A total of more than 100 billion online searches are done each year by people around the world using Firefox browsers and this is expected to increase Yahoo's market share.  

As of last month Yahoo accounted for 12.8 per cent of search volume in the US. Google took 64.5 per cent and Bing had 19.8 per cent. 

This is complicated slightly by the fact Yahoo is powered by Bing.  

The firm is also said to have struggled as people moved from laptops and desktops to smartphones and tablets - although Yahoo Mail is still one of the leading providers in many regions.

Yahoo's profit for the quarter ending in December fell 52 per cent from a year earlier while revenue dipped 1 per cent. 

However, Mozilla announced in December it was ending its partnership with Google as the default option for Firefox web searches. 

People using the browser in the US are being switched to Yahoo.

A total of more than 100 billion online searches are carried out each year  using Firefox browsers and this is expected to increase Yahoo's market share considerably.

The research centre in the Haidian district was set up in 2009 to 'provide products and technologies in making the world’s daily habits inspiring and entertaining.' 

It was used as an extension of the Sunnyvale-based company and engineers focused on studying search and advertising tools.

It is not clear when the offices will close and its website hasn't been updated yet    

Yahoo sold its Chinese operations to Alibaba Group Holding in 2005 and stopped offering services in the region in 2013. 

In January, Yahoo boss Marissa Meyer announced plans to spinoff off its Alibaba holdings, which are valued at more than $32 billion.

The closure is not said to be linked with government concerns or controls.
