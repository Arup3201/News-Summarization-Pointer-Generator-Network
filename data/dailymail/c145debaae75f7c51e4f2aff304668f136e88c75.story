Teen pop idol sped through Miami at dangerously high speeds in a rented Lamborghini hours before he was arrested on January 23

Justin Bieber was driving at speeds of up to 136mph on the same night he was arrested for drag racing, it has been alleged.

The teen pop sensation sped through Miami Beach, Florida at dangerously high speeds in a rented Lamborghini hours before he was pulled over by police on January 23.

Newly-released GPS speed readings, obtained by TMZ, claim to be Bieber's speed log for the entire night - and not just the minutes around his arrest.

According to newly-released GPS readings, reportedly from Justin Bieber's rented Lamborghini on January 23, the singer was traveling at triple-digit speeds on a Miami causeway

At 1.23am, Bieber reportedly hit 108mph on the Julia Tuttle causeway in Miami Beach on his way to a nightclub - then, in under a minute, he revved the car to a speed of 136mph. 

The readout is highlighted in red on the log to signify that the RPMs reach the extreme end of the scale.

When he arrived at Set nightclub at 2.27am, Bieber stayed for an hour and then drove away in the flashy car.

The 19-year-old was later stopped shortly after 4am for allegedly doing 60mph in a residential 30mph zone. He was arrested for DUI, drag-racing and driving with an invalid licence.

An earlier report by TMZ showed that after Bieber left Set, he was traveling at 44mph before he dropped to a speed of 27mph two minutes later. 

The website claim that the significance 
behind the figures is that the 27mph reading came on the 3700 block of 
Pine Tree Drive - where the speed limit is 30mph - and that if Bieber 
had been drag racing at that point, the reading would have been 
significantly higher.

Police had originally claimed they 
caught sight of the drag race on the 2600 block of the road, before 
Bieber was pulled over and arrested in the 4100 block.

TMZ
 claim that if the GPS records are correct, the figures will cause 
issues for prosecutors in the case, as it will mean that Bieber's car 
was pulled over for a reason that doesn't actually exist.

Regardless
 of the GPS records, official toxicology reports from Bieber's arrest 
show that the singer had marijuana and the active ingredient of Xanax in
 his system when he was arrested on January 23.

The star has pleaded not 
guilty to DUI after the arrest. He is due to be arraigned on Valentine's Day.

The
 charges are part of a string of recent run-ins with the law. The singer and five of his entourage are also accused of assaulting a limousine 
driver on December 30 after they were picked up from a nightclub.

Toronto
 police released a statement saying the limo driver and an unnamed 
passenger had an altercation during which he was hit on the back of the 
head 'several times'.

The FAA is also looking into whether Bieber and his entourage were taking marijuana and interfered with the crew of a charter jet as it came from Canada to Teterboro Airport shortly before the Superbowl. 

The Los Angeles County Sheriff has launched an investigation to find out if Bieber egged a neighbor’s house last month, leaving $20,000 in damages.

In the days following his arrest in Florida for allegedly drag-racing, a petition was started to have the Baby singer - who is a citizen of Canada - deported. Within days, the petition garnered more than 100,000 signatures.
