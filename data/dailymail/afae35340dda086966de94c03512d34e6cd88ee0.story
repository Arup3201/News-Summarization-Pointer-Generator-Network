A pampering few hours spent at the hair salon can you make you feel like a million dollars.

Unfortunately, the bill at the end for a cut, colour and blow dry can feel like it is making a million dollar dent in your bank account.

Now, a hair salon is offering clients the option of investing in a hair 'savings account' with weekly direct debit payments that can be used to pay for their hair appointments.

'Lay-by for hair': Clients withdraw from their fund to pay for hair appointments, avoiding being hit with one large bill

TONI&GUY are launching the Future Hair Fund, encouraging their clients to treat the service as they would a gym membership.

Starting from $20 per week, clients contribute regular payments to their fund, which they make a withdrawal from to pay for their salon service.

Rather than saving up for months to afford their hair appointment, clients opt in to invest as much as they want over the $20 minimum per week, depending on how 'high maintenance' their hairstyle is.

A platinum blonde requiring regular touch ups would contribute more per week than someone with a low-maintenance colour.

Promotion: The Future Hair Fund is currently available in 36 salons across Australia

Editor of cult beauty website Gritty Pretty Eleanor Pendleton is the face of the new promotion, and likens the service to 'lay-by for your hair'.

She says: 'The TONI&GUY Future Hair Fund will make large service bills a thing of the past by providing the opportunity for flexible payment options. 

'Australian women (and men) continue to seek financial efficiency within their lifestyle choices without wanting to compromise on service quality.'

New or existing clients activate the service with an initial consultation to determine the type of services they require, and book in for regular appointments in advance.  

If the client wants additional services (for example, stopping in for a blow dry, or extra highlights) and they don't have enough in their fund to cover the service, they can simply top it up with a one-off payment.

The promotion launched on March 6 in 36 TONI&GUY salons across Australia, with 90 clients already signed up.

Louise White, owner of White Social on Sydney's Northern Beaches, is a client at the TONI&GUY group's Manly salon and has activated her Future Hair Fund.

'It means I don't get hit with a $200 plus bill in one hit,' she tells Daily Mail Australia. 'With budgeting $20 a week it makes my splurge at TONI&GUY a little easier with budgeting for a family of four.'

Katy Reeve, TONI&GUY National Creative Director and Manly salon owner, adds: 'Via the Future Hair Fund TONI&GUY are providing the opportunity for more Australian women (and men) to have access to premium hair fashion.'

The Future Hair Fund is expected to be expanded to all Australian salons, with a view to roll out the service worldwide.
