Abou Diaby will be offered a new contract at Arsenal if he returns to fitness, Arsene Wenger has confirmed.

The injury-hit midfielder has made just two appearances in as many seasons and he has seven months to run on his current deal. 

It was expected Arsenal would not renew the 28-year-old's contract, but speaking ahead of his side's trip to Stoke, Wenger revealed the France star does have a future at the Emirates Stadium.

2005/06 16 appearances, 1 goal 

2006/07 19 appearances, 1 goal

2007/08 28 appearances, 4 goals

2008/09 36 appearances, 4 goals

'Diaby is on the fringe of coming back into full training but he is not there yet - he has a calf problem,' said Wenger.

'His injuries are never severe but little grade one tears. He is not available yet. 'If Diaby is fully fit, he will have a new deal at Arsenal.' 

Wenger faces a defensive crisis ahead of his side's clash against Stoke with Nacho Monreal ruled out, while Laurent Koscielny and Kieran Gibbs face late fitness tests. 

'We have to assess a few players today because we had some bad surprises with Nacho Monreal being out for tomorrow’s game,' revealed Wenger.

'Hopefully Kieran Gibbs will be available and back in the team and we have to assess some other players like Laurent Koscielny and a few bumps and bruises that we got after the game on Wednesday. I’ll make that decision after training today.

'I would like to play Koscielny because he is a very important player in our squad, and ideally I hope he will be available tomorrow. That decision will only be made tomorrow morning. Koscielny is an inflammation of his achilles, the problem is that when he plays, the inflammation comes back.'

Arsene Wenger could be without a host of key players for Arsenal's Premier League trip to the Britannia
