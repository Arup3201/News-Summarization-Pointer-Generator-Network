An immigrant who killed a disabled jeweller during a burglary was on the run from a Polish prison, it emerged yesterday.

Ireneusz Melaniuk, 28, beat Peter Avis, 66, around the face with an ashtray before stabbing him 13 times after breaking into his home.

Mr Avis, who used a walking stick after suffering a brain aneurism, had no chance of defending himself and died of his injuries. Melaniuk had been serving time in his home country for robbery, but fled to Britain after being granted day release three years ago.

It is understood Melaniuk could not be
 found on a European watch-list, so British authorities would not have 
known he was a wanted man. He evaded capture by using a variety of 
aliases, and carried a fake passport to enter the UK.

However, he had several distinguishing
 features which would have made him stand out. The two middle fingers of
 his right hand above the knuckles are missing, as is the thumb from the
 same hand. He also has tattoos on his hands.

After the murder in Bury St Edmunds, 
Suffolk, the killer returned to Poland, where he was later arrested. 
Last night the UK Border Agency faced questions as to why it had no idea
 that Melaniuk was a wanted man.

Tragedy: Mr Avis was described as an 'old-fashioned jeweller' who relied on a walking stick and frame to get around after suffering a brain aneurysm more than 20 years ago

David Ruffley, MP for Bury St Edmunds,
 said: ‘The first question we should ask is how did an escaped criminal 
on the run from Poland not get picked up at the UK border?

‘This reminds us of the need to tighten our borders so that heinous crimes like this don’t happen on our doorsteps.’

Vicky Ford, MEP for the East of 
England, added: ‘If you have relatively open borders, then you need to 
have the ability to protect yourself from very dangerous people, which 
means sharing information.’ Earlier this year Ipswich Crown Court heard 
how Melaniuk and friend Aleksandra Karpiuk, 27, raided Mr Avis’s shop in
 January.

They broke into the flat above the 
store and attacked him when he tried to confront them. He had lived on 
his own since the death of his mother in 1989.

Melaniuk was driven to Stansted 
Airport by his accomplice and boarded a flight to Poland. The following 
month Polish police tracked him down. He was extradited and in August he
 admitted murder.

EU citizens can freely live and work 
in Britain, but can face deportation if they are still claiming state 
hand-outs after three months. Melaniuk was thought to have been living a
 nomadic lifestyle in Britain and did not have a regular job.

The UK Border Agency said its officers
 had no contact with Melaniuk once he passed through immigration 
control. A spokesman said it was Poland’s responsibility to ensure 
Britain is told when criminals could be entering the UK.

Melaniuk also admitted burglary. 
Karpiuk, of Bury St Edmunds, was convicted of assisting an offender and 
conspiracy to commit burglary. They will be sentenced later.

Weapon: This knife was found on Melaniuk's person following his arrest in Poland
