Chinese security officials carried out anal probes on more than 10,000 pigeons released during National Day celebrations, amid fears they may have been carrying bombs.

The birds were released during this morning's dawn ceremony in Beijing's symbolic heart, Tiananmen Square - but only after each bird passed a rigorous and highly unusual examination for explosives.

Beijing police were concerned that would-be terrorists targetting one of China's biggest public events this year may have  used the birds as mobile bombs - rigging them with incendiary devices that could be detonated either at close proximity to a government official, or as the birds flew over the crowd.

The symbols of peace were released at sunrise in  Tiananmen Square in a ceremony for the October 1 holiday to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Beijing domestic security police officer Guo Chunwei was quoted in the Jinghua Times as saying workers checked the wings, legs and anus of each pigeon ahead of time to ensure they were "not carrying suspicious material." 

The entire process was videotaped, and the birds were then loaded into sealed vehicles for the trip to Tiananmen Square, the newspaper said.

A similar report appeared in the Beijing News, and the People's Daily tweeted about it in English: '10,000 pigeons go through anal security check for suspicious objects Tue, ready to be released on National Day on Wed.'

The reports — which did not say what the suspicious materials might be — drew amused and derisive responses from some Chinese readers, and many news sites - including the Beijing News website - later deleted the reports.

Tens of thousands of pro-democracy protesters have taken to the streets of Hong Kong this morning as demonstrations spread to new areas of the territory on Chinese National Day. 

There was little sign of momentum flagging on the fifth day of the mass campaign, whose aim has been to occupy sections of the city in order to express fury at a Chinese decision to limit voters' choices in Hong Kong's 2017 leadership election.

Some protesters  could this morning be heard jeering Chinese National Day celebrations despite earlier fears that police would use force to move the massive crowds on before events marking the 65th anniversary of the Communist Party's foundation of the People's Republic of China began.

The crowds have brought large sections of the Asian
financial hub to a standstill over the past five days, disrupting businesses from banks
to jewellers. Overnight thunderstorms failed to dampen spirits
and the protesters woke to blue skies on Wednesday.

Riot police had used tear gas, pepper spray and baton
charges at the weekend to try to quell the unrest but tensions
have eased since then with both sides prepared to wait it
out - at least for now.

Members of the Chinese public responded with sarcasm because they see in the pigeon body searches their own plight in what they consider an oppressive society with tight surveillance, censorship and judicial injustice, according to independent commentator Zhang Ping.

'The liberty and dignity of citizens are increasingly vulnerable, and can be expropriated at any time, like with the pigeons,' Zhang wrote in an editorial that was circulated on social media under his pen name, Changping.

'They have to go through the pains and insults of the rude anal check and yet they must appear peaceful and happy on the screen of the state broadcaster.'

The security measures reflect heightened concern about violence following a string of attacks blamed on separatist militants from the country's ethnic Uighur Muslim minority, as well as bus explosions and random slashing attacks attributed to disgruntled individuals.

Last October, three Uighurs in a vehicle rammed through crowds in front of Tiananmen Gate in central Beijing and set off explosives in an attack that killed themselves and three bystanders.

Beijing authorities also are sending police helicopters to monitor highway checkpoints, ring roads within the city, major intersections and areas with heavy traffic, including popular tourist spots such as the Great Wall and the Summer Palace, the Beijing News said. 

Additionally, the capital has mobilized 850,000 citizen volunteers to help keep a lookout in the city of about 20 million people, the newspaper said.
