Porto right back Danilo is set to join Real Madrid.

Reports in Spain had claimed the 23-year-old was at the centre of a tug-of-war between the La Liga giants and Manchester United.

However, Sportsmail understands there was no serious interest from the English club and that Danilo is currently in advanced talks with the Champions League winners.

Danilo, in action last month for Porto against Vitoria, is close to completing a £27million move to Real Madrid

His representatives met with Madrid officials last week and held further talks with Porto to underline the player's wish to leave and an announcement is thought to be imminent.

Danilo's contract has 16 months left to run and Porto have made attempts to get him to agree a new deal.

He played in the Dragons' 3-0 win over Sporting on Sunday night before picking up a yellow card and being substituted with six minutes to play.

United have been linked with Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne and Barcelona's Dani Alves, with out-of-favour Brazilian Rafael expected to depart Old Trafford.
