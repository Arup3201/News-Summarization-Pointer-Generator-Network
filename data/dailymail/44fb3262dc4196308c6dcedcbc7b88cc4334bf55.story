More than a million coffee-makers have been recalled after users suffered serious burns from being spattered with scalding liquid.

The Tassimo single-cup brewers and espresso T-discs have caused problems, with 140 reports of consumers being sprayed with coffee grounds - including 37 incidences of second-degree burns.

In one case, a ten-year-old girl in Minnesota suffered second-degree burns to her face and neck and was taken to hospital.

Hazard: Almost two million Tassimo single-cup brewers have been recalled after some containers used in the machine to make tea and coffee exploded and left consumers with second-degree burns

The Consumer Product Safety Commission said the machine's T-disc, the plastic container holding the coffee or tea, can explode while brewing.

In the U.S, some 835,000 models have been recalled and 900,000 in Canada.

The machines, made by BSH Home Appliances Corporation based in Irvine, California, have been sold at department and home improvement stores across the country and are widely used in hotels and restaurants. They were also available to buy online from June 2008.

The product is also available in the UK from major department stores, electrical goods outlets and supermarkets. However the recall is limited to the U.S. and Canada.

Danger: Around four million Tassimo espresso T-discs made by Gevalia, Maxwell House and Nabob have been recalled as there have been reports they can clog and cause hot liquid to spray from the machines

The consumer agency also announced the recall of four million packages of Tassimo espresso T-discs after 21 complaints.

There were four reports of second-degree
burns. One injury involved a two-year-old girl in Canada who 
received second-degree burns to her face.

The containers, which are inserted into the Tassimo coffee-maker to make single cups of espresso, can become clogged and spray hot liquid on to bystanders.

The recall involves Gevalia, Maxwell House and Nabob brand espresso T Discs, sold in packages of eight and 16.

The problem may affect around 2.1 million packages in the U.S. and another 1.9 million in Canada.
