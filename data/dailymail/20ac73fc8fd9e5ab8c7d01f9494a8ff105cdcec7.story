Liverpool have stepped up their efforts to sign Adam Lallana by tabling an improved £25million offer for the Southampton midfielder.

Brendan Rodgers is keen to bring the England international to Anfield and Liverpool showed their ambition shortly after the end of the Barclays Premier League season with a £20million opening bid.

Lallana, who is wanted by a number of other Premier League clubs, has his heart set on a move to Liverpool but negotiations have proven difficult as Southampton owe 25 per cent of any fee they receive for the 26-year-old to Bournemouth.

Liverpool have all but wrapped up a £4million deal for Lallana's team-mate Rickie Lambert - he is due on Merseyside on Satuday to complete a medical and finalise a two-year contract before rejoining England's World Cup squad - but they are now determined to reach a conclusion with their main target.

The £25million Liverpool have tabled is a 'take it or leave it' and the decision now lies with Southampton over whether they accept and grant Lallana his wish or they bring an end to negotiations.

Should the move collapse Liverpool, who remain on the trail of Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno, would turn their attentions to Bayern Munich's Xherdan Shaqiri, who they have lined-up as an alternative to Lallana.
