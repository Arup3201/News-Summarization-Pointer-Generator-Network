Lindsay Lohan has been sentenced to serve 30 days in jail after admitting she violated her probation.

The troubled actress waived her rights at her probation violation hearing at the Los Angeles Superior Cour Airport Branch and admitted the violation.

Judge Stephanie Sautner ordered the actress so surrender to the jail by November 9.

She was not immediately put behind bars because the judge decided to allow her time to complete her nude photo shoot for Playboy, according to TMZ.

The star's lawyer, Shawn Holley, is 
understood to have told the judge in chambers that her client had a $1 
million contract with Hugh Hefner's publication.

Lindsay's jail sentence wasn't the only talking point today. The mark on the actress' left arm also caught the eye of some observers. While at first glance it appears to be a mere grimy smudge or bruise, it is in fact, an unfinished tattoo.She had outline of a young angelic girl (illustrated in full below) inked on last year. It was chosen because 'she liked the innocence of the girl', according to reports at the time, but it has never been completed.

She must completed the shoot this 
week or face being in breach of her contract and Sautner decided to 
allow her one week to surrender, the website reports.

In court, the judge imposed an otherwise strict probation regime, telling the actress: 'I'm giving you the keys to the jail.'

Judge Sautner said: 'Miss 
Lohan you are going to waive your right to the hearing and admit the 
violation, do you understand?'

Lohan replied: 'Yes, your honour'

Sautner then sentenced the actress to
30 days in jail with 270 days to be stayed as long as Lohan complies 
with her probation conditions.

The jail time can be reduced due to 
overcrowding in Los Angeles jails - but Saunter was firm there was to be
no house arrest or electronic monitoring.

TMZ reports that she may serve just minutes behind bars.

A source within the Sheriff's Deptartment told the website that if someone receives a misdemeanor sentence of 90 days or less, they are routinely processed in and then released. 

'She'll be out without even having to change her clothes,' the insider says.

Judge Sautner told Lohan: 'You are to surrender by November 9 and begin serving 30 days.

'You will not be eligible for house arrest or electronic monitoring.

'When you get out you will report to the
probation department and Ms Mansfield. Good luck to you with Ms 
Mansfield - she is no nonsense.'

As well as serving the jail time the actress must continue her community service at the Los Angeles county morgue.

In order to comply with the judge's strict order Lohan will spend virtually every day she is not in jail at the morgue.

Judge Sautner said: 'The sentence I am going to impose is known as putting the keys to jail in the defendant's hands.'

If she fails to abide by the schedule she could be sent locked up for another 270 days.

Judge Stephanie Sautner may have sentenced Lindsay Lohan to 30 days in jail.

But in all likeliness, the actress may not even spend a single night there - due to jail overcrowding.

Lohan has to surrender to jail by November 9.

Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the LA County Sheriff's Department, told TMZ said how long she stays in jail depends on when she decides to check herself in.

Officials told the website that misdemeanour inmates only tend to serve 20 per cent of their sentence - although inmates sentenced to 90 days or less are processed and released immediately.

Only a backlog of people to process or delays in paperwork might mean Lindsay would have to stay the night.

Even though Judge Sautner was strict about the terms of Lohan's sentence, prison officials told TMZ that a federal court order on overcrowding 'trumps everything'.

In another twist, Lindsay could be in jail on the same day as her father Michael, who is currently in solitary confinement in the infirmary of the Orient Road jail in Florida.

While Lindsay has to surrender to jail on November 9, her father will appear in court on the same day to face a judge on charges stemming from the breach of a restraining order against his former fiance Kate Major.

It follows allegations he assaulted her - and he could face jail time for allegedly breaching the restraining order and contacting her.

At the beginning of the hearing the 
Los Angeles prosecutor told Judge Sautner Lohan had failed to keep 
appointments at court mandated psychologist therapy sessions and failed 
to attend mandated service at a downtown women's shelter in Los Angeles'
rough skid row area.

Judge Sautner said she had 
made enquiries for Lohan to work at the Good Shepherd shelter for abused
families in Los Angeles but they did not want her.

She said: 'They were 
unwilling to take you because they do not think you are a good example 
for women trying to put their lives back together.'

However, the Los Angeles morgue where
Lohan has already been serving community service was happy to keep the 
actress on, Sautner said.

'I am converting all your community service to the morgue,' Sautner said.

When Lohan is released from jail she 
will have to report back to the court December 14th having already 
completed 12 days at the morgue.

She will then have to complete 12 
days community service before a hearing on January 17 to have the 270 
day jail sentence stayed. She will have to complete an additional 12 
days by February 17 to have the sentence stayed again.

And finally she 
must complete another 17 days by March 29, which if she completes 
successfully will result in her sentences being commuted to summary 
probation without her having to appear in court or see Judge Sautner 
again.

'You need a structure, and this is a structure,' the judge told Lohan before the actress accepted the terms of her new probation.

Judge Sautner also told Lohan she must attend every court ordered psychological therapy session without fail.

Sautner said Lohan should be under no
illusion that if she fails to stick to the letter of her orders she 
will serve the additional 270 days.

'If probation officer Ms Mansfield notifies me I will put a warrant out for your arrest,' she said.
