An innocent man who spent years on death row after being tricked into confessing to a double murder says he finds it hard to forgive the people who put him in prison.

Alstory Simon, 64, admitted to the killings in 1999 as a result of an investigation by an anti-death penalty group which has since been accused of using threats and false promises to force the drug addict into his confession.

The investigation by the Medill Innocence Project helped free death row inmate Anthony Porter just days before his execution, a case that was cited when the state announced a moratorium on capital punishment in 2003 and its abolition in 2011.

That also spared Simon the death penalty, but he went on to serve 15 years in the Jacksonville Correction Center before being released after the Cook County Attorney's Office re-examined his conviction.

Free: Alstory Simon confessed to a double murder in 1999, mainly because of an investigation from a team of students at Northwestern University. He was released from Jacksonville Correctional Facility last week

As he adjusts to life as a free man, Simon has spoken of his anger at the tactics used by the Medill Innocence Project.

Speaking to Fox News, he said: 'It was very hard to get along with knowing that fact - that I was locked up in prison for something I knew I didn’t do.

'It can make you kind of mean, but as time went by I overcame it.' 

The Medill Innocence Project, led by former Northwestern University Journalism Professor David Protess, confronted Simon at his home claiming that the mother of one of the two victims of the 1982 shooting had placed him at the scene.

Days later, private investigator Paul Ciclino and another man returned with flashing guns and police badges and urged him to confess if he wanted to avoid the death penalty.

He denied any involved but the group persisted, promising him a light sentence and royalties from a book they were writing on the crime.

They also showed him video of his ex-wife and another man who later turned out to be actor claiming they witnessed Simon commit the murder.

'They did everything that’s forbidden by the law enforcement community,' Simon said.

'These people went to great lengths to do what they did to me, and I never did anything to anyone.' 

Simon's attorney Terry Ekl claims the team, led by Professor David Protess (pictured) framed his client so death row inmate Anthony Porter could become a 'poster boy' for the bid to end executions in Illinois

Earlier this month, it was reported by the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that Simon's attorney Terry Ekl claimed the team of journalists and their professor at the Innocence Project framed his client so Porter could become a 'poster boy' in the bid to end executions in the state.  

Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez added that the 'tactics and antics' of the investigator, Paul Ciclino in conjunction with Protess could have added up to criminal charges or obstruction of justice and intimidation of a witness at the time.

However it would be impossible to file charges because the statute of limitations has run out.

Simon, wearing a grey hoodie and jeans when he was released from prison, told reporters outside Jacksonville Correctional Center that he was angry.

'I'm not angry at the system. I'm angry at the people who did what they did to me,' he said, crying as he told reporters that his mother had died while he was behind bars. 

Simon was convicted and sentenced to 37 years in prison - he served 15.

But the Cook County State's Attorney's Office began re-examining his conviction last year after his attorney presented evidence that he had been threatened with the death penalty and coerced into confessing with promises that he would get an early release and share in the profits from book and movie deals. 

Alvarez said he was tricked by a private investigator who stormed into his home and showed him a videotape of a man who said he had seen Simon pull the trigger.

The man turned out to be an actor.

'In the best interest of justice, we could reach no other conclusion but that the investigation of this case has been so deeply corroded and corrupted that we can no longer maintain the legitimacy of this conviction,' Alvarez said.

The Porter case helped lead former Gov. George Ryan to declare a moratorium on executions in 2003, and he cleared death row by commuting the death sentences of more than 150 inmates to life in prison. Gov. Pat Quinn abolished the death penalty in 2011. 

Alvarez did not say whether she believed Simon is, in fact, innocent, but she said there were so many problems with the case.

Frustration: Simon, wearing a grey hoodie and jeans when he was released from prison, told reporters outside Jacksonville Correctional Center that he was angry at 'the people who did this to me'

One of them was what she called a coerced confession and the deaths of a number of key figures, making it impossible to determine exactly what happened on the morning of Aug. 15, 1982, when two people were shot to death as they sat in a park on Chicago's South Side. 

She also said there remains powerful evidence that Porter was the gunman, including several witnesses who still maintain their original statements.

'As I stand here today, I can't definitely tell you it was Porter who did this or Simon who did this,' she said. 

Protess, who retired from Northwestern in 2011 amid questions about his investigative methods, has not responded to phone calls for comment, but has previously defended his methods and results. 

Ciolino, who like Protess has denied acting improperly, released a statement that emphasized that Simon confessed multiple times, including to a TV reporter and his own lawyer.

'You explain that,' Ciolino said. Nonetheless, he added, no one should be in prison if the state did not meet its burden of proof.

Advancing claims: Porter spent 16 years on death row prior to his release. Illinois put a moratorium in place on executions in 2003 and the death penalty was abolished in 2011
