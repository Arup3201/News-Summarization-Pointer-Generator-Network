Cameron Diaz has found herself at the centre of a plagiarism row after an Italian author sued the producers of her  film The Other Woman claiming they  ripped off one of his novels.

Writer Paolo Limiti claims 20th Century Fox stole the plot of his 1999 novel Bugiardo e incosciente (Liar and Fool) for their film which came out earlier this year.

The film, like the book, is about a woman who discovers her boyfriend is married and cheating on both his wife and herself with a third much younger woman.

All three women then join forces to get revenge on the man and bring about his economic ruin

Lawyer Daria Pesce representing My Limiti said the only difference was that the book is set in Italy, while the film takes place in the United States.

Limiti wrote a script based on his novel in English in 2007 and had shown it to a series of American, Mexican and Spanish producers, his lawyer said.

It 'is highly likely that one of the people involved had shown the book or the script to an employee of 20th Century Fox', the writ lodged at the Court of Milan says, according to investigative magazine Panorama.

There was no immediate comment from 20th Century Fox.

The Other Woman which was made on an estimated budget of $40,000,000 was released in April this year and proved a minor hit at the box office taking in $24,763,752 on its opening weekend.

It has since gone on to gross almost $83million in the USA alone.

However it was panned by many critics with The Daily Mail's Brian Viner slamming it for a lack of laughs and awarding it just two out of five stars.

Even the normally generous Empire Magazine awarded it just two out of five stars, describing it as 'shrill and flabby'.
