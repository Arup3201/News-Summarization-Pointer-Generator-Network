A 13-year-old girl who was declared brain dead after undergoing a routine operation to have her tonsils removed is to be taken off life support - against the wishes of her family.

Jahi McMath suffered complications and went into cardiac arrest at Children's Hospital Oakland in Northern California following the procedure to cure her sleep apnea on December 9.

Now the head of the pediatrics department has told the family that Jahi will be taken off life support because she has been declared dead under California law, KTVU reported.

'We didn't want her to be removed from life support but the decision is out of our hands because it's been declared a legal death,' Omari Sealey, McMath's uncle, said.

Loss: Jahi McMath, 13, suffered cardiac arrest after having her tonsils out and has been declared brain dead. The hospital will now switch off her life support, even though her family does not want to

Under California law, to declare someone legally brain dead, two doctors must declare it at least three hours apart.

Before the doctors gave their decision to the family, Jahi's heartbroken mother Nailah Winkfield said she had felt that the hospital was pressuring her into switching off her daughter's life support so that they could re-use the bed.

'They
 just have a social worker follow me around all day long asking me "Do 
you have any other family that needs to see her?" like trying to put a 
rush on it,' Winkfield told ABC 7, breaking down.

Chatman had added to the Oakland Tribune that 
as long as her daughter's heart was beating, they wanted to keep her in the hospital, 
even if it means spending Christmas in there.Â 

'As long as she has a pulse, we want her on life support,' Sealey said. 'We want her to come home for Christmas. We want to give her presents. We want a chance for a Christmas miracle.'

Apprehensive: Jahi was nervous about undergoing surgery but her mother assured her she'd be fine. As she was recovering, she was bleeding from the mouth and nose and suffered cardiac arrest

Beloved: Jahi's mother Nailah Winkfield has said that she believes God will 'spark her brain awake'

The tragedy unfolded after Jahi went to the hospital for the routine surgery, even though she did not want to. Her uncle said she had told her mother 'something bad is going to happen to me'.

The child's mother Nailah Winkfield and 
grandmother Sandra Chatman say hospital staff failed to provide adequate
 care and attention to the clearly ailing patient.

She underwent the surgery but as she was recovering she started to bleed from her nose and mouth.

'My daughter had actual clots sliding out of her mouth and they gave me a cup and said, "Here, catch them with the cup so we can measure them,"' Winkfield told ABC 7.

Chatman, herself a surgical nurse, said nursing staff did not react until she began screaming for help.

'I was the last one to see Jahi,' said 
Chatman. 'I said, "Somebody help my baby please!" And they came in and 
starting working on her. The next thing I know, the doctor said, "Oh no,
 she doesn't have a heart rate anymore."'

Investigation: Oakland Children's Hospital has said it will investigate what happened after the surgery

'There was a lack of urgency,' Jahi McMath's uncle Omari Sealey said. 'It's shock, it's disbelief. You never think something like this will happen to you.'

Jahi went into cardiac arrest and was resuscitated.

She spent the following day, Tuesday, on a ventilator, but by 2am on Wednesday doctors said she had swelling in her brain, and on Thursday, she was declared legally brain-dead, according to the Oakland Tribune.

Spokesperson for Oakland Children's 
Hospital said in a statement: 'We're very sad about this outcome, about 
what's happened to her, but at this point I have no information on the 
details of the surgery.

'We
 will certainly investigate what happened. In any surgery there are 
risks and there can be unexpected, unanticipated complications.'
