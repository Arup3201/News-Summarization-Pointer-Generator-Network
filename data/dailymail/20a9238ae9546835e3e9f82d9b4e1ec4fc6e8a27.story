A bus company has axed a busy route after it fell victim to ‘crash for cash’ fraudsters 15 times in two years.

Central Buses said the final straw came when it received 15 insurance claims from people saying they were passengers hurt in a collision that actually involved just four people – none of whom was injured.

A motorist travelling alone braked sharply in front of a single-decker bus carrying two passengers.

Geoff Cross, managing director of Central Buses, said the company had been forced to axe the 98 route from Small Heath to Ward End in Birmingham because of the so-called cash for crash scam

Despite repairs to the bus and car costing only £500 each, the firm ended up paying out £25,000 to avoid the costs of fighting each case in court.

Yesterday the company said it had to withdraw the 98 service from Small Heath to Ward End, in Birmingham, to avoid any more fraudulent claims.

The city has become a crash for cash hotspot, with six of its postcodes among the ten UK districts where the crime is most likely.

The scam involves criminals staging crashes between vehicles in order to make claims against motorists for injuries such as whiplash and for damage to vehicles.

Geoff Cross, managing director of Central Buses, said anyone wanting to claim should be forced to pay a £50 bond before any legal action, to make fraudsters think twice about lodging bogus claims.

‘We’ve known for a long time about this phenomenon – to our bitter cost,’ he said.

Charity Crimestoppers named Birmingham as a crash for cash capital, along with Bradford, based on insurance data

‘The most serious incident happened in Alum Rock when our driver noticed a car being driven erratically.

'It cut him up and braked sharply. Our driver braked too, but was unable to avoid a collision.

'There was only the driver in the car and two passengers on our bus but we ended up with 15 claimants all claiming they had been injured.’

It is thought associates of the fraudsters were encouraged to lodge claims for compensation over the ‘accident’ – taking the total to 15.

Mr Cross said: ‘Insurance companies are often reluctant to fight the claims, even if they do think they are bogus.

'If we were to go to court the costs would be astronomical … At present [claimants] have nothing to lose by going with a no-win-no-fee lawyer.’

The firm now runs 17 services, all fitted with CCTV cameras to deter fraudsters.

Mr Cross added: ‘If we hadn’t installed CCTV we probably wouldn’t be in business now because of the fraudulent claims.’

In December, the charity Crimestoppers named Birmingham and Bradford as crash for cash capitals, based on insurance data.

The cities host nine of the ten districts where the crime is most likely. The final area is in Bolton.

The Insurance Fraud Bureau estimates the annual cost of crash for cash scams is £392million.
