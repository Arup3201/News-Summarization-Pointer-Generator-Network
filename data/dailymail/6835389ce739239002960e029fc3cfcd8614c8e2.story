Arrest: Darriean Hess faces two charges of negligent manslaughter

A 19-year-old woman has been charged today after plowing into a group of cyclists, and killing two of them, as she drove without a license.

Darriean Hess was charged with two counts of negligent homicide and two counts of assault after hitting four cyclists taking part in a charity ride on Saturday morning.

Two Massachusetts friends, Pamela Wells,
 of South Hamilton, and Elise Bouchard, of Danvers, were killed and two 
of their friends were injured after being hit on a bridge at 8.30am.

As Hess, from Seabrook, New Hampshire, was charged over the deaths, it emerged that police had stopped her the previous day for driving without a license.

She has been accused of driving too fast for the road conditions and number of cyclists, when she crossed over a center line and hit the riders on a bridge, district attorney Jim Reams said.

Her victims had been taking part in the 40th annual Granite State Wheelmen Tri-State Seacoast Century ride.

The 19-year-old had been stopped on the same road eight hours before the crash and ticketed for driving without a license.

Hampton Police Chief James Sullivan said the officer in that stop followed policy when he issued her an appearance ticket then allowed a friend to pick her up and drive the car away.

'It's unfortunate that the incident happened the next day but the officer had no way of knowing that,' Mr Sullivan said.

Mr
 Reams would not say if the young woman's license had been suspended and
 said only that she did not currently have a New Hampshire driver's 
license.

Police believe the
 car belonged to a friend. Mr Reams said there isn't any evidence yet to
 suggest charges could be brought against the friend.

The car came to a stop after it 'decimated the Welcome to Seabrook Beach sign' deputy police chief RIch Sawyer said.

One of the women who died, 60-year-old Mrs Wells, was described as a devoted mother to her two children aged 16 and 17, the Boston Herald reported.

In a Facebook statement Tom Rogers, her husband of 19 years, called her the love of his life and said: 'Pam was the best thing that ever happened to me.

She had been taking part in annual two-day cycling event, that takes in roads in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

On Saturday, about 1,500 bicyclists were taking part in the event, but it was the first time Mrs Wells had joined in.

She was planning to ride 100 miles for the first time and had been working up toward it all summer with Ms Bouchard, Mr Rogers said.

Andy Wallenstein, chairman of 
publicity for the Granite State Wheelmen, which organizes the annual 
event, said the crash was the first major accident for the 40-year-old 
event.

'A few skinned knees or something like that, but I don’t believe there’s ever been anything like this,' he told the Boston Globe.

'Anybody that gets injured bicycling, I think, affects the whole group, because it just makes us aware of how vulnerable we are out on the road.'

All four charges are felonies that bring a maximum of up to seven years in prison upon conviction.

Bail was to be set Tuesday night and Hess is expected to be arraigned tomorrow morning.
