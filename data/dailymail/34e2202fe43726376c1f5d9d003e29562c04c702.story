The next mayor of New York City will be chosen at the polls today and it is Bill de Blasio's race to lose as the Democratic candidate is beating his Republican rival by more than 40 points in the latest polls.

Even though experts predict that turnout will not be particularly high, de Blasio's lead is so great that there is little to stop him from becoming Michael Bloomberg's successor.

De Blasio got another boost of moral support from his daughter Chiara who surprised him Tuesday morning by flying to New York from her college in California in order to go to the polls with him.

A Marist poll released on Monday had de Blasio leading Joe Lhota 65 per cent to 24 per cent among likely voters.

‘There's only one poll that counts and it's the one that closes at 9pm,’ Lhota said at a Monday campaign appearance.

The campaign has been as much about the policies of Bloomberg, who leaves office at the end of the year after three terms, as the candidates' vision for the future.

De Blasio frequently talks about the ‘two New Yorks’ - one rich, one poor - and how the city has left less fortunate New Yorkers behind as the contrast between the have's and have-not's has grown increasingly stark.

De Blasio, who as the city's elected public advocate acts as an official watchdog, has positioned himself as a clean break with the Bloomberg years, promoting a sweeping liberal agenda that includes a tax increase on the wealthy to pay for universal pre-kindergarten and improved police-community relations.

He has especially criticized the controversial police tactic of stop-and-frisk, which critics say unfairly targets poor blacks and Latinos.

Bloomberg has called the approach 
central to the city's anti-crime fight, while de Blasio has blasted it 
as destructive to police and community relations.

Those
 campaign tactics, and a pledge to reach out to New Yorkers who feel 
left behind by what they believed were Bloomberg's Manhattan-centric 
policies, have been rewarded in the polls.

Lhota, who has struggled to shake de Blasio's formidable lead, has launched an assault of negative ads. But that strategy has mostly backfired with an increasing number of voters saying they have a negative view of the Republican, Marist has found.

Though registered Democrats outnumber their Republican counterparts 6 to 1 across the city, the last Democrat to become mayor was David Dinkins in 1989.

However, the GOP victories were tied to some extraordinary events that scrambled the political landscape.

Mayor
 Rudy Giuliani defeated Dinkins in 1993 amid fears about the city's 
soaring crime rates, and Bloomberg won in 2001 largely thanks to his 
fortune and the fallout from the September 11 attacks.

Opponents have been counting down the days until Bloomberg's third term comes to a close, but for many months of the ensuing campaign, De Blasio did not seem like his likely successor.

He was a distant fourth for much of the summer in the crowded Democratic primary, only to surge past former front-runners including City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner, and is now on the verge of ending an improbable Republican winning streak in the mayor's office.
