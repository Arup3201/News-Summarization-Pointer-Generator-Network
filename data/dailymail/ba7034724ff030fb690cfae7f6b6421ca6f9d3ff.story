Officials have announced improved public safety measures for the final two miles of the Boston Marathon April 21, a year after two explosions near the finish line killed three people and wounded more than 260 others.

Mayor Martin Walsh and Police Commissioner William Evans Saturday said more uniform and undercover officers will be deployed along the marathon's Boston route.

Authorities also have installed more than 100 cameras along the Boston portion, together with 50 observation points that will help monitor the crowd.

Boston's finest: There will be a large police presence through the week leading up to race, starting with a memorial service Tuesday, the one-year anniversary of the attack

Thirteen ambulances will be deployed, together with 140 emergency medical service workers on foot patrol, bicycles, utility vehicles and in medical tents.

Officials urge spectators to leave backpacks, strollers and other large items at home.

There will be a large police presence through the week leading up to race, starting with a memorial service attended by Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday, the one-year anniversary of the attack.

‘It will be the Boston Marathon as it has always been,’ Mayor Martin Walsh said during a press conference in front of city hall. ‘Our goal is for everyone to enjoy the race.’

Walsh said the city has prepared extensive security measures for preventing as well as responding to emergencies.

The two ethnic Chechen brothers suspected of planting the bombs at the finish line were identified using footage taken from security camera.

One of the brothers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died after a gun battle with police several days after the attack while the other, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is awaiting trial.

Officials also emphasized that increased security will be found not just at the finish line, but along the entire course.

Though all major marathons are a challenge to secure, given the 26.2 mile spread, the Boston Marathon's route through eight municipalities makes it all the harder for security officials to coordinate protocols.

Preparations are also under way to help those affected by the bombings last year cope with feelings that might be triggered by the anniversary, officials said.

‘The first anniversary of a disaster is always difficult,’ said Barbara Ferrer, director of the Boston public health commission.
