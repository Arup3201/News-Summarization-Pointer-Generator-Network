A teenager who was robbed at gunpoint turned detective and used her mobile phone to track down her stolen car and catch the thief who allegedly targeted her.

Monica Terrones, 19, had a gun held to her head at an apartment block in Houston, Texas, on Sunday morning, as thieves demanded she hand over her car keys, phone and purse.

But Miss Terrones wasn't going to let the carjacker get away with her belongings and decided to use her stolen phone to trace him.

Victim turned detective: Monica Terrones didn't take it lying down when a thief held her at gunpoint and stole her car - she used her phone to trace him

Trace: Miss Terrones logged onto on her computer and checked who the thief had dialled from her stolen phone

Clever:She then called every number that the thief had dialled until someone told her where she could find her car

She checked her phone records online and called everyone that the alleged thief had dialled since the robbery.

One of the people she called back told her that she could find her car at a nearby gas station.

So Ms Terrones called the police and went with them to find the car. She even rode along in a police car during the short car chase that ensued.

Her car was recovered when it crashed into a pole.

She told ABC News: 'I might be tiny - I don't think I'm any taller than 5ft 2ins - but you still don't mess with me and my stuff, I will hunt you down.

'I let him have my phone for a day and he made calls. I was like, okay, went online and called everyone, everyone on it, even if they hung up on me.'

Quintin Devone brown, 19, and an unidentified juvenile have since been arrested.

Mr Brown was charged with aggravated robbery while the juvenile was charged with evading arrest.

Miss Terrones now says that she will testify against the pair.
