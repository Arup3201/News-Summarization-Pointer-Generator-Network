BT customer Harvey Nott, who discovered he had been secretly signed up by the firm to make monthly donations to Children in Need 

Bungling BT workers secretly signed up a broadband customer to make monthly donations to Children in Need despite never having asked for his permission.

Harvey Nott, from Walton-in-Thames in Surrey was shocked to see that when he checked his internet bill, he was signed up to make monthly direct debits to the firm's 'supporters group'.

The 45-year-old married sales manager says the bill showed he had already paid three donations to the supporters fund without even realising.

Only when he did an online search for the BT supporters fund did he realise the cash was going to the BBC's appeal Children in Need. 

He then challenged the company, who could have taken donations worth £36 a year from his bank account without permission.  

Mr Knott said: 'I was never asked whether I wanted to make charity donations through my BT account.

'Their nominated charity is the BBC’s Children in Need. I have nothing against the money-raisers at the BBC but it was shocking not to have even been asked if I wanted to donate.

'I challenged the bill and was told by BT that it would take a week for them to listen to a recording of my phone call at the time I signed off for the broadband package.' 

When contacted, a spokesman for BT said today that they wished to apologise to Mr Nott and added that they had repaid the charity donation money wrongly taken out of his account.

But Mr Nott added: 'I got the impression BT did not really care about their mistake while I was trying to get them to correct the error. However, once the media took up my case, there was instant success.

The BBC's appeal which was presented by Sir Terry Wogan and Tess Daly, pictured, was broadcast last week. Mr Nott was unaware he was signed up to donate to the charity  

'It makes you wonder how many other customers are inadvertently paying charity donations without even realising it.

When a direct debit arrangement is in place, customers should receive advance notice confirming when payments will be taken and how much they will be – it is advisable to check this to confirm the details are correct.

If a direct debit payment has been taken which is not what was agreed – for example, too much has been taken or the payment has been taken on the wrong date - you are entitled to an immediate refund of the amount debited from your bank under the direct debit guarantee.

If you cannot get the company - which in this case was BT - to sort out the problem, contact your bank. The guarantee is offered by all banks and building societies that accept instructions to pay direct debits.

He now says he will be keeping a close eye on his statements after the mix-up which he claims happened when he renewed his contract.

He said: 'As you can imagine, I was most perturbed. I had renegotiated my contract with BT about a month earlier and nothing whatsoever was mentioned about a direct debit.

'Something was very clearly wrong. It was theft from my bank account because they were taking money I haven’t agreed to. 

'If I hadn’t noticed that, it would have been £36 a year, which may not seem a lot, but in these times that’s a lot of money for some people.

'I am sure there are many others who are blindly giving away cash because they haven’t noticed. I probably wouldn’t have noticed if I hadn’t been looking at my bill so closely.

'BT was supporting Children in Need at the time but it could be another charity, I don’t know how regularly it rotates, and customers could be giving money to charities they don’t especially wish to support.

Mr Nott says BT often rotate the charity they support and at the time he was donating, the cash was going to Children in Need, whose mascot is Pudsey bear, pictured with Sir Terry Wogan  

'People are being left out of pocket by this and it’s not on. BT has a responsibility to make people aware of what they are signing up to. It’s ludicrous.'

A spokesman for BT explained: 'BT customer services have removed the donation charge and put a £12 credit on to Mr Nott’s account as an apology.

'Customer services have not been able to speak to Mr Nott but have left a voicemail and emailed him.'
