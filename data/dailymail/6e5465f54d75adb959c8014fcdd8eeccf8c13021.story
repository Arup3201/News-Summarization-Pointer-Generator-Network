A World War One soldier's life was saved when prized photographs of his loved ones he kept in a wallet in his breast pocket blocked the path of a piece of shrapnel as it hurtled towards his body.

Private William Taylor kept the eight pictures of his family in his pocket during the entire four years of the conflict.

And in a remarkable quirk of fate he survived a 
battle which left three quarters of his regiment dead or injured thanks 
to the stack of photos which took the impact of a shell blast.

The projectile pierced the outer layer
 of his leather wallet and perforated seven of the eight photos, 
stopping as it reached the last picture of his younger sister Lilly.

Pte Taylor escaped the near-death experience with just a broken rib.

He had spent the entire war on the 
frontline and survived the hell of the Somme, Passchendaele and Ypres 
before bringing the photographs, now bearing holes from the shrapnel, home with him.

The first seven postcards clearly show
 the path the shrapnel took as it went through Pte Taylor's breast 
pocket, with the size of the hole getting fractionally smaller the 
further it travelled.

Pte 
Taylor twice won the Military Medal for bravery, the first time for 
risking his own life by dashing into No Man’s Land to rescue a wounded 
comrade stranded in a shell hole.

Pte
 Charles Winch, who came from a neighbouring village to Pte Taylor’s 
home in Hertfordshire, was so grateful he sent him a birthday card every
 year - thanking the soldier for saving his life on the Somme in 1916.

Now,
 nearly a century on from the battle, Pte Taylor's own story of survival
 and his gallantry has emerged after his grandson dug out the 
war-damaged photographs and medals for an exhibition to mark the 100th 
anniversary of the start of the First World War.

'Like
 many others, my grandfather didn’t say very much about the war but he 
did tell us about how these old family photos saved his life,' said grandson Dave Taylor, 55.

'When
 he left for France in 1914 he took these pictures with him as 
keepsakes. In quiet moments he got them out and looked at them and 
remembered his family back at home.

'He tucked them away in his wallet which he always kept in his breast pocket. Luckily that trivial act saved his life.

'There are impact marks about a 
centimetre big on every photograph bar one from the shrapnel. The one at
 the very end was of my great auntie Lilly, his sister.

'He was incredibly lucky.

'My
 grandfather was there from the start of the war until the end. How he 
and others like him survived is down to little quirks of fate like this 
one. It is an amazing story.'

Pte Taylor, from Hertford, volunteered for he Hertfordshire Regiment, which was part of the Territorial Army, at the age of 23 and went to France in November 1914.

He acted as a stretcher bearer at the Battle of the Somme in 1916, when he saved Pte Winch, who had been badly wounded by a shell blast.

Mr Taylor, an accountant, said: 'This poor chap was badly wounded but couldn’t get out without assistance

'After the war Mr Winch lived in Watton at Stone, a few miles from my grandfather’s home, and ran a sweet shop close by.

'My father remembers seeing him riding his bike and bearing the facial injuries he sustained in the war.

'He remained in contact with my grandfather and we still have a birthday card he sent in 1975 which reads "Many thanks for helping to save my life on the Somme Nov 13 1916.

'“Also I know you did the same for many others".'

In July 1917 during the Third Battle of Ypres, otherwise known as Passchendaele, Pte Taylor had his own brush with death.

His battalion was fighting at were at St Julien at Flanders and came under heavy shell and machine gun fire - when Pte Taylor was struck by the shrapnel.

Following his recovery from his broken rib he was awarded a Bar to his Military Medal for his overall gallantry and devotion to duty.

He was promoted to Lance Corporal and after the war he went to work as a gardener.

He married wife Gladys in 1928 but tragically she died two years later as she gave birth to their twin children, William and Lilla, who are now aged 84.

Pte Taylor bought up the twins with the help of family members, and married his second wife Joyce in 1943.

History: Pte Taylor's grandson dug out the war-damaged photographs and medals for an exhibition to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War

He served as an air raid warden during the Second World War and died in 1979 aged 88.

Dan Hill is leading the Herts at War project which is holding an exhibition of untold First World War stories from August.

'Corporal Taylor’s wartime experiences are a poignant mix of extreme bravery in battle and incredible fortune that saw him saved by the wallet of family photos that he carried,' he said.

Grateful: Soldier Charles Winch always sent Pte Taylor a birthday card thanking him for saving his life, and after his death in 1979 sent this letter to wife Joyce

'It is testament to his character that Private Winch, who he saved whilst winning his first military medal, wrote to him well into the 1970’s thanking him for saving his life on the Somme some 60 years earlier.

'We are incredibly proud to tell his story, one of so many that deserve preserving and remembering for generations to come.

'By including his personal effects in the Herts at War exhibition we hope to encourage others to search their own family past and remember those that served so honourably in The Great War.'
