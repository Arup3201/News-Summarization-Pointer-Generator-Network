Steven Gerrard won't be the first Premier League star to join LA Galaxy.

David Beckham, Landon Donovan, Juan Pablo Angel and Abel Xavier featured both in England and America for LA Galaxy.

Skrtel and co appeared in high spirits following Monday night's 2-1 victory over Wimbledon in the FA Cup third round.

Summer signings Lazar Markovic, Alberto Moreno and Rickie Lambert were also in attendance along with defenders Glen Johnson, Luis Enrique, Javier Manquillo. 

Skrtel's wife Barbara Lovasova was right in the thick of it in a picture of the WAGs published on Jose Enrique's instagram page. 

Rodgers arrived with girlfriend Charlotte Hinds, with Enrique and partner Amy Jaine posing for snaps outside. 

Spanish pair Alberto Moreno and Javi Manquillo were all smiles with their respective other halves as the atmosphere around the camp looked jovial ahead of the weekend's game away at Sunderland.

Most of the group were together in the city centre, including young goalkeeper Danny Ward, whilea cluster of wives, girlfriends and players all mixed for a meal.

Meanwhile, Los Angeles Galaxy coach Bruce Arena has confirmed Steven Gerrard will join the club in July.

In an interview with the LA Times, Arena revealed what is expected to be officially announced later on Wednesday.

'Steven Gerrard arrives in July and by then we will certainly have a plan available,' Arena said. 'He's a player of quality. I'm not concerned about how he's going to fit in with our team.

'We have a club now with a proven history of success. All those things go hand in hand in making LA Galaxy a very attractive team for players such as Steven Gerrard.'  

The 34-year-old Liverpool captain has agreed an 18-month contract, worth £3.9million a year, to move to California and will start playing in the MLS when their mid-season transfer window opens in July. 

Gerrard reiterated his respect for manager Rodgers and said nobody was to blame for his exit

Gerrard revealed he had turned down offers from clubs in the Barclays Premier League, Europe and the Middle East.

Most significantly, though, he revealed he would have committed his future to Liverpool had they offered to extend his terms when he retired from England.

When he ended his England career after the World Cup, it was with the intention of committing to Liverpool for the next ‘two or three years’ but an offer did not arrive until last November.

‘If a contract had been put in front of me in pre-season I would have signed it,’ Gerrard told the Liverpool Echo. ‘I’d just retired from England to concentrate on Liverpool.

‘I didn’t want my club games to be tailored. My injury record had been fantastic for the past two-and-a-half years and I had a great season from a personal point of view last season.

‘It is all ifs, buts and hindsight now. That period between the summer and the end of November gave me thinking time. There’s no blame and I’m not angry about it.

‘There are other people in the squad and the club had other things to worry about. Liverpool FC have been unbelievable for me since I was eight. This club has helped me fulfil my dreams.’ 

Rodgers had wanted to keep Gerrard at Anfield and the iconic midfielder insisted again that the decision to part was amicable; he made his decision after Rodgers revealed he would be tailoring his game time next season.

Such is Gerrard’s quality, though, his availability alerted a number of clubs, with Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini, for one, expressing his admiration.

But Gerrard said: ‘I had a lot of offers — domestically, from Europe, Asia and America.

‘When I decided the time was right to leave Liverpool, I knew straight away I wouldn’t ever sign for another domestic club or anyone in Europe.

‘I never wanted to find myself in the situation where I was coming back to play against Liverpool. Even if I went somewhere else in Europe I’d be running that risk in terms of the European competitions.

‘Also, I said to myself that if you want to play for a big team in Europe with a great coach then I may as well stay put as I had all that here already.

‘That wouldn’t have been the change I was looking for. The attraction of America was a different lifestyle, a different culture for myself and my family.’
