Tens of thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes as the River Elbe burst through a dam and flooded parts of eastern Germany.

Today the Elbe breached another levee on its relentless march towards the North Sea, forcing Germany to evacuate ten villages and close one of the country's main railway routes.

Upstream there was some relief as the river slipped back from record levels in Magdeburg, the capital of Saxony-Anhalt state.

At least 21 flood-related deaths have been in reported in central Europe following a week of heavy rain, leading to rivers swelling and extensive damage.

The latest confirmed death was an 
80-year-old man in Austria who died of a heart attack yesterday during 
the clean-up operation in the wake of floods.

Magdeburg had water levels more than 16ft above normal over the weekend, although the Elbe has now retreated by about a foot.

More than 23,000 people had to leave their homes in the city when the electricity was cut off and streets flooded.

But further downstream, a levee at Fischbeck, west of Berlin, was breached overnight, prompting officials to evacuate ten villages in the area.

Germany's national railway had to close a bridge near Fischbeck on the line from Berlin to Cologne, Frankfurt and Amsterdam.

Residents in the Rothensee neighbourhood of Magdeburg were evacuated with tanks, trucks and buses.

'Rothensee is filling up like a bathtub,' army spokesman Andre Sabzog told news agency dpa.

Around 700 soldiers were trying to build a dam of sandbags around a power substation to protect it from the Elbe.

If the substation floods, thousands 
of households would be left without water and it would lead to a 
breakdown of the neighborhood's dewatering pumps.

Another 8,000 people were evacuated 
from the town of Aken and its neighbouring villages after a dam on the 
Elbe river broke Saturday, police spokesman Uwe Holz said.

Further north on the Elbe river, 
residents were trying to protect themselves from flooding by building 
levees along the banks of the rising waterway.

Officials in Saxony-Anhalt state also were investigating what appeared to be a threat to destroy dams.

Several
 media outlets said they had received a letter threatening to blow up 
dams on the Elbe river, Holger Stahlknecht, the state's interior 
minister, said Sunday.

'We
 are taking the letter seriously,' he told dpa. He said authorities have
 stepped up their surveillance of dams and urged residents to remain 
calm.

Stahlknecht said: 'We should accept 
that we humans should be humble, that even in the 21st century we don't 
completely control nature - that is one lesson from this situation.'

He said it was too early to analyze what, if anything, might have been done to prepare better for flooding.

In Budapest the River Danube 
threatened to burst its banks as parts of the city's north and south 
were already underwater, but began to ease back overnight.

The city escaped significant damage, 
and Prime Minister Viktor Orban said soldiers and rescue workers would 
shift their focus further south.

The river peaked at record highs of nearly 30ft last night as 
desperate homeowners, hotel staff and military reservists piled sandbags
 in front of their buildings to protect the Hungarian capital.

No roads were left visible in the partially submerged village of Nagymaros, 37 miles west of Budapest

In Budapest the government is reportedly planning a crisis meeting with the other countries affected to see how the cost of the disaster can be shared

More
 than 7,000 soldiers and volunteers laid out a million sandbags to 
strengthen flood defences on the river bank, where some flood walls 
stand at 30.5ft.

Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Poland 
and the Czech Republic have all been affected by the worst floods in 
central Europe in a decade.

The Danube – Europe’s second longest 
river which flows through four capital cities and ten countries – 
started rising rapidly in Hungary last Friday.

Military reservists were joined by locals who filled sandbags and packed them on top of walls along the river

The Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban said dykes had been strengthened at critical points in Budapest.

However, authorities have said that river defences designed to withstand floods would be high enough to protect the city.

'The flood is now approaching Budapest, the heart of the country,' Orban told reporters in Esztergom, which is 30 miles north of Budapest.

The deluge reached Hungary on Friday but Prime Minister Viktor Orban  said 'the next two days will be decisive'

Twenty people reportedly have died in the floods across central Europe after several days of heavy rains

'Two decisive days are ahead of us because the danger will be where most people live and where most things of value are at risk. It is now when we have to gather all our strength.

'In Budapest ... it is not simply the flood which is the problem ... but
 the complicated public works system through which all kinds of problems
 can arise.'

At least 1,400 people have been evacuated from towns and villages along the Danube and 44 roads have been closed. More than 200 people in Budapest had already left their homes.
