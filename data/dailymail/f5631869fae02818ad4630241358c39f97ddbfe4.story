A mother-of-one believes she’s a better mother thanks to her 32G breast implants.

Tamsin Wade, 19, from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, hated her deflated and uneven 32AA bust.

As her confidence plummeted, she refused to leave the house, meaning her son, Finley, 2, couldn’t attend play dates and after school clubs.

Tamsin took a loan of £5000 to pay for surgery to increase her breasts from 32AA (left) to 32G (right)

Tamsin, pictured with boyfriend Joe and son Finley, first became anxious about her flat chest when she gave birth in April 2012

The beautiful blonde wasn’t able to do anything with her son without feeling shy and embarrassed about her appearance.

But realising the affect her low self esteem was having on little Finley, Tamsin took out a bank loan to pay for the £5,000 surgery, and now believes she’s a better mother thanks to her new assets.

Tamsin said: 'Since having my boob job I have been so happy.

'I was unable to go swimming with Finley as I felt so self-conscious.

'I was forced to wear baggy clothes to hide my figure and getting into a bikini made me feel so uncomfortable that me and Finley had never been swimming.

'I started to shy away from going out at all as I just felt so bad about myself.'

Tamsin, pictured after surgery, says before her breast implants her mood and confidence were low, affecting both her life and her sons

But since having the surgery Tamsin has got her confidence back, allowing her to hit the pool and join new toddler groups with her son.

She said: 'After the surgery I felt so much better and immediately started joining mum and baby groups for me and Finley.

'He loves them and I love spending quality time with him.

Since her surgery, Tamsin, here with boyfriend Joe and Finley, says she has regained her confidence and now has signed up to numerous mother and son playgroups

'My loan repayments are around £140 a month and it hasn’t stopped me from doing anything with my boys, if anything we do more now than ever.

'I feel comfortable to take him abroad now too as I won’t mind wearing skimpy clothes and bikinis - it’ll be great to go on holiday with him.

'We will probably go on a last minute holiday.

'Finley has always been my number one priority, but now I don’t let anything hold me back from being the best mum I can be.'

Tamsin first became anxious about her flat chest when she gave birth to Finley in April 2012.

Tamsin said: 'Before I had Finley my boobs were a 32D but the aftermath of being pregnant left me with double A’s.

Tamsin is convinced that her new bigger cleavage (left with her old white bra and new pink one) has made her a better mother to Finley (right, playing with her)

'So I lived in baggy clothes despite only being petite because I didn’t want anyone to notice my boobs.

'It just really knocked my confidence as my body had changed so much, I wasn’t used to it.

Tamsin’s confidence was so low that she was unable to take Finley to the beach, swimming classes, even taking him down to the shops had become a struggle.

She said: 'My general mood was low, I had no confidence and felt myself hiding away.

'I knew I couldn’t carry on feeling like this as it was affecting my entire life.

'I wanted to do more with my son, he is my world and I felt as though I was restricting him too.'

Tamsin started looking into getting a breast enlargement online.

She said: 'I started researching the best cosmetic surgery groups.

'After meeting up with numerous surgeons I finally went to a consultation with MYA.

'They were amazing, they made me feel really relaxed, I couldn’t wait to book my surgery in with them.'

Tamsin says that despite monthly loan repayments of £140 she now does more with Joe and Finley than ever before

Since Tamsin’s transformation she and her boyfriend, Joe Johnson, 26, have started looking forward to the future.

She said: 'We can now look forward to a family holiday’s together.

'It has drastically improved my relationship with Joe as I’m no longer shy about getting changed in front of him.

'He is thrilled with the results too.'

Tamsin hasn’t said no to having more surgery in the future, although she loved the experience with MYA Cosmetic Surgery Clinic.

She added: 'I would think about getting a nose job but it doesn’t bother me that much.'

MYA said: 'We are delighted that Tamsin chose MYA for her procedure and we think she looks phenomenal.
