The first motorbikes to be made by the legendary Brough Superior marque in over 70 years are set to be rolled out onto British roads.

A limited production run of 300 Brough Superior SS100 machines that were made between 1925 and 1940 is nearing completion after a British businessman bought the rights to the company name. 

Mark Upham, of Taunton, Somerset has already secured dozens of orders for the modern-day version of the vintage SS100 bikes that were described as the 'Rolls Royce' of motorcycles and were the fastest machines in the world.

Playwright George Bernard Shaw owned one the motorbikes as did TE Lawrence - Lawrence of Arabia - who was killed after crashing one near his home in Dorset in 1935. 

Only 3,000 SS100s were made before the outbreak of war ground production to a halt.

Back then they were such a luxury item that only the very wealthy could afford one. 

Today, a fully-restored period SS100 can sell for upwards of £300,000.

Mr Upham's new gleaming models will be sold for £50,000 each from next year to mark the 90th anniversary of the launch of the SS100.

While they look almost identical to the classic Brough bikes and have the same 'saddle' petrol tank and speedo, they are made using high-tech components such as aluminium-magnesium and titanium.

Other modern-day advantages the new bikes have are a four-disc ceramic brake system and a 1,000cc V-twin engine which can deliver 140bhp.

Mr Upham, 57, said he wanted to carry on manufacturing the SS100s as he believes it is what the late George Brough would have wanted.

Bough Superior SS100 motorbikes were made by George Brough in his 'Brough Superior' works on Haydn Road in Nottingham, from 1925 to 1940.

Dubbed the 'Rolls-Royce of Motorcycles', around 3,050 were made before the outbreak of war ground production to a halt. 

Back then, they were such a luxury item that only the very wealthy could afford one. It is understood that around a third of those made still exist today.

Brough Superior motorcycles were produced using British-made parts and were coveted by the rich and famous, including playright George Bernard Shaw.

TE Lawrence, known as Lawrence of Arabia, owned seven of the motorcycles and died after crashing one in Dorset in 1935. 

George Brough named his company Brough Superior to out-do his father who was also a motorcycle manufacturer.

Each motorcycle was assembled twice. It was put together first to ensure all the components fitted properly before it was taken apart, repainted and individually styled.

Only then would it be reassembled before being test driven and then personally certified by George Brough.

The SS100 model would be tested at 100mph or more before being driven and if it did not meet specifications, would be returned to the workshop.

At the time, they were the most expensive road-going motorbikes in the world with 1920s and 30s prices ranging from £130 to £180.

Today, a fully-restored period SS100 can sell for upwards of £300,000.

He said: 'George Brough made 3,000 SS100s over 20 years until 1940 and had to stop because of the war. Brough Superior did made the crankshaft for the engine in the Spitfire during the war.

'After the war he wanted to get back into manufacturing but he was becoming an older man and there was also a lot more competition around from bikes like Vincent.

'Next year will mark the 90th anniversary of the launch of the SS100 and our idea is to emulate the past.

'George Brough's dream was to create an SS100 with its own bespoke engine which is what we have achieved.

Other modern-day advantages the new bikes have are a four-disc ceramic brake system and a 1,000cc V-twin engine which can deliver a whopping 140bhp

Mr Upham, 57, said he wanted to carry on manufacturing the SS100s as he believes it is what the late George Brough would have wanted

'It is designed as a tribute to the most famous Brough Superior model in the company's illustrious history, replete with technical innovations and high-tech components.

'We have respected Brough's heritage by making an all-new motorcycle without any compromises in terms of technical components or design.'

George Brough named his company Brough Superior to out-do his father who was also a motorcycle manufacturer. He produced his custom-made machines out of a factory in Nottingham using British-made parts.

Mr Upham is manufacturing the new bikes out of a factory in Toulouse in France and has sourced parts from all over Europe and China.

He said: 'We have used high quality materials in the creation of a true bespoke motorcycle, just as George Brough made in the past.

'We launched a prototype bike at the Milan Motorshow last year and got a really good response. We have taken 35 orders already just for the UK and many more from customers across Europe.

'I think people would love to see these bikes back on British roads again.'

At £50,000, a new SS100 is slightly cheaper than some top-of-the-range Japanese superbikes.

Mr Upham, a former dealer of Triumph and Ducati motorbikes, said manufacuring the new SS100s was a long-term profit and it wouldn't be until at least three years before Brough Superior Motorcycles will turn a profit on them.
