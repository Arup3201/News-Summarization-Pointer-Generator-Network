TV viewers feel that the elderly get less air-time than other age groups, and older women in particular are ‘invisible’, a BBC report reveals.

The research showed viewers felt there was a perceived habit of treating the elderly as ‘peripheral’ or ‘token figures’ in drama, comedy and entertainment shows.

They said the elderly were treated as ‘props’ for other stories, and regularly portrayed in a ‘humorous’, ‘mocking’ or ‘insulting’ manner.

Pensioners were often said to be portrayed as stubborn with a ‘tendency to moan about things’ or in some cases as an ‘adorable idiot’.

The criticism comes after ex-Countryfile
presenter Miriam O'Reilly, 54, won a substantial payout from the 
Corporation after they axed her because of her age.

In last year’s landmark ruling the 
BBC was accused of being obsessed with attracting younger viewers and of
‘social engineering’ for sacking her because she was seen as too old.

The report also said shows such as Question Time, QI and Mock The Week were accused of using ‘token women’ on their panels.

It said: 'Some panel shows were... criticised for rarely having women represented or only having 
‘token women’ on their programmes.

'Comedy shows, such as QI or Mock the 
Week, as well as current affairs programmes such as Question Time were 
implicated in this.'

Both male and female viewers raised 
concerns about the vanishing of older women from screens, with more than
a third of women over 55 saying there were too few of their 
contemporaries on TV.

While the BBC
put 'expert' older men such as Sir Bruce Forsyth and Sir David 
Attenborough on screen, they are placed with glamorous young women, the 
report authors said.

Discrimination: Gina Yashere is the only female panellist in this Mock The Week panel which also features (back row (l to R) Frankie Boyle, Hugh Dennis, Russell Howard, Frank Skinner and front host Dara O'Briain and Andy Parsons.

They said they thought it was 
generally the case that ‘a person develops “a face for radio” at a 
certain point in their middle years’ and were ‘replaced with what people
felt were less qualified but younger, more  attractive women’.

Among
the positive role models for older generations were Dame Maggie Smith’s
character in Downton Abbey, the experts on Antiques Roadshow and Joanna
Lumley.

Strictly Come 
Dancing was praised for the broad range of ages among competitors, but 
concerns were raised that older contestants, such as Ann Widdecombe, 
were being exploited as ‘figures of fun’.

All male panel: Question Time, chaired by David Dimbleby, was singled out for putting only a 'token' woman on their panel. He is pictured with Chris Huhne, left, and Alex Salmond

Viewers said the retired politician had been put on Strictly 'for a laugh' although she could 'hardly dance'.

One 72-year-old man questioned for the study said the way older people were treated on the show was 'embarrassing'.

'We didn’t like older people making a fool of themselves on telly, 
producers and directors …are taking advantage and are using it for 
entertainment,' he said.

'An example of this would be (Strictly) Come Dancing…its 
just embarrassing…I don’t like seeing older folk being exploited.'

The Serving All Ages survey of 180 viewers aged 13 to 92, carried out for the BBC by independent social research institute NatCen, warned these ‘dated and inaccurate stereotypes’ could result in older people feeling ‘marginalised’.

But it found that the elderly were much less ‘sensitive’ about the way they were portrayed than young people, 40 per cent of whom felt they were shown as ‘disrespectful’ and ‘dysfunctional’ with ‘vacuous and unproductive lives’.

Mark Thompson, BBC Director General 
and Chair of the Cultural Diversity Network, said: 'There are lessons 
here for the BBC and the rest of Britain’s broadcasters.

'It is young people who are most concerned with the way they are portrayed and we need to look at this.

'But
we should also note the concern, expressed by older people generally, 
about the need for greater visibility for older women. While of course 
there are many older women presenters and actors across our airwaves, 
this is something that needs to be addressed.'

■ Radio 5 Live has been told to tone down its reputation for being ‘Radio Bloke’ and start appealing to more women.

A report by the BBC’s governing body found that men make up 72 per cent of the station’s audience of 6.7million listeners each week. The BBC Trust told bosses it wanted to see a ‘more even balance’ of listeners.
