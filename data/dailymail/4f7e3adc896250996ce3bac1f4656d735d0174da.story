Another drop in attendance has Broadway singing the blues.

Despite big budget performances and desirable stars currently lighting up the Great White Way, ticket sales have slumped for the second-straight year.

The decline was blamed mainly on a feeble fall season and Superstorm Sandy, whichforced all 40 Broadway theaters to shutter for three days.

When they reopened, all shows reported massive losses. One of the hardest hurt was the Matthew Broderick musical Nice Work If You Can Get It, which lost $538,853. Wicked lost $490,996.

Crain's New York reported that attendance at Broadway shows plummeted 6 per cent (11.3 million) from this time in 2012. Last year, a 2 per cent dip in showgoers was reported.

The May-to-May Broadway year began with shows that were widely seen as flops - like Chaplin and David Mamet's The Anarchist - which shuttered before the year was over.

But audiences have seen a boost with star power from Tom Hanks (in Nora 
Ephron's final play Lucky Guy) and Bette Midler (starring in a one-woman
show I'll Eat You Last: A Chat With Sue Mengers).

Theatergoers are also packing into 
critically-acclaimed shows like Kinky Boots and Motown: The Musical - as
well as family-friendly hits like Matilda and Annie - which opened 
later in the season.

Seth Gelblum, a lawyer who boasts 
many Broadway clients, told the site: 'This has been a very strange 
season because all the successful shows opened at the end.

He added: 'The results 
are a fluke of timing.'

The sun will come out tomorrow: Many are banking on family-friendly shows like Annie - and shows that opened late in the season - to boost ticket sales in 2013

But one aspect of Broadway that saw an increase was ticket prices, which increased a whopping 9 per cent this year to an average of $101 each.

Powerhouses like The Book of Mormon and Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark - which go for as much as $150-$300 a ticket - continue to draw big crowds despite the prices.

Ken Davenport, a producer of Macbeth and Kinky Boots believes that now is not the time to worry, but next year may be.

He told Crain's: 'I will be more concerned if we see three straight years of attendance declines.'
