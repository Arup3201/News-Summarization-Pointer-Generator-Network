Police in Oregon have seized almost 14 pounds of heroin that was hidden inside a car's frame rails worth $650,000.

Jesus Alejandro Vega-Cazarez, 19, and Jose Luis Mariscal Gonzalez, 42, were arrested last week following a three-month investigation into suspected drug trafficking.

A surveillance team spotted the pair meeting up at a garage in Vancouver, Washington, for an alleged drug swap.

When they were caught, officers searched their vehicles and recovered 13.8lb of the drug - enough to provide around 1,251,914 individual doses - and $90,000 in cash.

Stashed: Jesus Alejandro Vega-Cazarez, 19, and Jose Luis Mariscal Gonzalez, 42, were arrested after officers from Portland, Oregon, police found 13.8lb of heroin worth $650,000 inside the frame of a car 

The substance was stashed in black tubes and was attached to green string.  

On March 19, officers from the Portland Police Bureau Drugs and Vice Division saw two vehicles arriving at the location in Vancouver. 

They watched as the men carried unknown items into a garage, closed the door and then left in different directions a few minutes later.

Following the alleged drug drop, police tracked down the two vehicles a short time later and searched them.  

A statement from Portland Police read: 'Investigators were conducting surveillance and observed the occupants of two vehicles meet up in Vancouver Washington. Investigators observed the occupants carry items into a garage and close the door. A short time later the parties exited the garage and went in different directions.

'Investigators, with the assistance of officers with the Vancouver (WA) Police Department, eventually contacted both vehicles and detained the occupants at Southeast Mill Plain Boulevard and 160th Avenue.

Seized: Officers also seized $90,000 in cash from inside one of the vehicles. They were stopped following an alleged drugs swap in Vancouver, Washington 

'Approximately $90,000 was seized from one vehicle and 13.8 pounds of heroin was seized from the frame rails of the other vehicle. Four individuals were detained and two were eventually lodged in the Clark County (WA) Jail on drug-related charges.

'Investigators later served search warrants on two residences in Oregon associated to the suspects.

'The 13.8 pounds of heroin is estimated to be worth $650,000 (wholesale) and translates to approximately 1,251,914 individual doses.
