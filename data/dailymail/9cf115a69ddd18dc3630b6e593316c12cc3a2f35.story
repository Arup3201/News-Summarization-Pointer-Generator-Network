It is the most damning statistic of all: no goals in eight appearances. It is Wayne Rooney's record in World Cup finals, and his record in major tournaments in general has hardly been inspiring. Rooney has scored five goals in six appearances in European Championships but four of those came at Euro 2004, his breakthrough tournament when the then 18-year-old was widely acknowledged as one of the stars.

Since then there has been the broken metatarsal and red card of Germany 2006, non-qualification for Euro 2008, the brooding, angry young man berating supporters at South Africa 2010, and the player suspended for the first two games of Euro 2012 and who looked short of match fitness for the two in which he subsequently played.

It is no 
record for a player who aspires to be among the world's greats. Prior to
 recent tournaments there has been an attempt to build up expectation 
and construct a sustainable argument to suggest that this time it will 
be different.

But perhaps the climate of major tournaments does not suit Rooney's 
physiology? Maybe he is simply more susceptible to the end-of-season 
fatigue that affects most Premier League players? Maybe he just is not 
as good as some think he is, although that theory would not account for 
the manner in which he can impose himself on Champions League games.

Certainly England manager Roy Hodgson accepts that Rooney is box office
 and, as such, the demands from the public will always be high.

'He knows 
the expectations,' said Hodgson. 'He knows how much everyone who writes 
about, watches or discusses English football demands of him. All I can 
say is I'm confident he'll give us the best he's got. You can only hope 
your attempts to prepare him mean that when he gets on the field he'll 
think, "I feel good and I'm going to do the things that made people 
build me up so high". 

'It must be the same for Hollywood film stars. When you make your first
 film and nobody knows much about you, you might get some good reviews. 
But one day you're going to be [a superstar like] Al Pacino or Jack 
Nicholson and suddenly every film you make has to be very good.'

Despite Manchester United's slump, Rooney has at least had a good season, in which he has seemed leaner and sharper. There are no obvious debilitating injuries to fear, the club insisting that he has been rested in the past few weeks to ensure he would be fresh for Brazil and not because his groin problem was serious.

Previous: Wayne Rooney has failed to score in eight matches at World Cup finals

Rooney is so determined to be fit for this World Cup that he headed out to the Algarve last week, taking not only his family but two physiotherapists to help him prepare for England's pre-tournament training camp in Vale de Lobo, also in Portugal. The first competitive sight anyone will have of him will be against Peru on Friday week in England's friendly match at Wembley.

The pre-tournament arrangements will be better suited to his temperament, too. In 2010 it included two weeks' seclusion in the Austrian mountains, followed by a remote training ground in rural South Africa. Fabio Capello's intention was to insulate his players but for the likes of Rooney it proved to be too restrictive.

Under Hodgson and a back-room team of English staff, the needs of English players will be catered for better this time. Miami, the venue for two England friendlies in the first week of June, and Rio de Janeiro, should provide ample stimulation.

Disappointment: Rooney's appearances at World Cup finals have been blighted by injury

But the key factor in enabling Rooney to demonstrate his worth may be the players around him. The relative abundance of attacking options in Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck, Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Raheem Sterling as well as the potential fluidity of the team suggests Rooney ought to feel more at home. It may well be the first time in his career in which an England team has actually been better than the United team for which he plays.

'I don't think we're going into this tournament with anything to fear, in terms of his commitment, fitness or desire,' said Hodgson. 'So from that starting point, if you compare it to 2012, when he couldn't play the first two games and he was disappointed and frustrated, then it's looking better for us.

'I'd like to think the squad we've picked
 is a very good one, with lots of exciting players. He won't have to 
shoulder the total burden of goal-scoring and goal-making, which he has 
at previous tournaments. There are plenty of players out there for us 
who can score or make a goal. So if I was Wayne, I'd be thinking: 
"Right, this is looking good, I've got good players around me, this is a
 great opportunity".'

Roy Keane, a former team-mate of Rooney's and an ITV pundit for the World Cup, agrees that the intensity for Rooney ought to be reduced this year. 'I think there is less pressure on Wayne,' said Keane. 'He still puts himself under the same pressure, but it's not coming from the media as much as before when he has gone in injured or with off-the-field stuff going on.

'There was stuff with Fabio Capello and an unhappy camp in 2010. This time I think Wayne has gone away to get a bit of sun and the fact that he has missed a bit of  football over the last month or two is no bad thing.

'People shouldn't be panicking. I have heard that he has taken medical staff away with him on his holiday - I am sure his wife is delighted with that! But sometimes you need down-time, the discipline to relax and rest the tendons, the muscles, your fibres, the mind which is probably the most important thing.

'I'm guessing but I think Wayne will be going into the World Cup in a good mindset and again I think he is surrounded by better players in attacking positions who can see more of a pass than previous squads have going into big tournaments. He has gone in on the  back of injuries before, I think there has always been that pressure on Wayne. But I think he is surrounded by better players now, who are on good form.'

Certainly you would hope that the image of an exasperated Rooney waving his arms in frustration, stranded up front alone as the defence and midfield retreat deeper and deeper, would be consigned to the past.

Clearly there will be periods when England concede possession and as the deeper-lying striker, Rooney will be expected to track back. Equally though, with Sterling, Lallana and Sturridge likely to be in the team, England will at least attempt to play at speed and with some style.

Hodgson hopes so at least. 'It gets suggested, "He was a disaster in such and such a tournament" and, therefore, every time I talk about a tournament now I'm expected to refer back to that tournament and say what a disaster he was,' he said.

'But I refuse to go along with that baggage. It's not me who's said, "2004 was great and since then it's been bad." I'm not saying that. 

'The only thing I would dare talk about Wayne with regard to tournaments is 2012. And there he tried very hard. He wanted it very badly. You could argue he wanted it too badly.

'This time I'm going to see a totally different person - hopefully, the person you're describing who burst onto the scene in 2004. Because he's only 28 years of age, he's in the best age of his football career. I suppose I could say that if he was terrific in 2004, he should be even better now.'

In reality, any player who fails to deliver for his nation in major tournaments will be damned by many football judges as having failed to make it into the higher echelons of the game. Quizzed as to whether this was fair. Hodgson reached for a lesson from the team's resident psychiatrist, Steve Peters.

'I'll give you Steve's answer to that one,' said Hodgson. 'He hasn't got far with me because I'm still making the old mistakes I always make. But every now and again there's a moment of epiphany and one has just come to me: "Life is not fair".'
