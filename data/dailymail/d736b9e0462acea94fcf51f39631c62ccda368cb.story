A mother has described her trauma at discovering her 15-year-old son had been sexually abused by a female security chief twice his age in a juvenile correctional center.

The woman, a nurse, said the night her child was admitted to Idaho's state correctional center in Nampa in 2012, she was upset but relieved.

'[The] night he went in, I felt bad, but I could sleep because he was safe,' she told the Wall Street Journal.

Horror: A mother has told how her 15-year-old son had sex three times with the head of security at Nampa

But just months later it emerged Julie McCormick, the 29-year-old head of security, had groomed the teenager into a relationship.

McCormick told a court in 2013 that she had sex with the minor three times, adding that she was 'in love with him'. She was jailed for up to 20 years in 2014.

'You hear about the Boy Scouts, you hear about the Catholic Church - those kids can walk away from it,' said the boy's mother, who has remained anonymous to protect his anonymity.

'My son couldn't.'

In a victim impact statement at the time, she raged at McCormick: 'I thought I was making the right decision to help my son, but I was wrong.

'You brainwashed my son into thinking he would have a life with you. 

'You gave us trust, and then you demoralized him.'

Since the conviction, eight other teenage boys and girls have filed allegations of sexual victimization. 

The mother's words come as a survey reveals 10 per cent of juveniles in US correctional facilities claimed they were abused in 2013, Press TV reported.

More than 80 per cent of incidents involved members of staff, the nationa survey of juvenile inmates states.

And around 90 per cent of the respondents were males alleging abuse by female staff.
