The National Health Service is rehiring more than 50 staff a month who have been given redundancy pay-outs, it can be revealed.

In just eight months the number of managers  who have returned after being paid off leapt by 10 per cent to 4,300.

The revelation will reignite the row over the revolving door of highly-paid administrators handed golden goodbyes worth thousands of pounds before walking straight into another role.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt argues the NHS reforms have saved £1.5billion a year, despite thousands of people given payouts returning to work in the health service

Under NHS rules staff must only wait four weeks after taking redundancy before they can move to a new job.

Last month the Treasury announced it would claw back payments under future redundancy programmes, but staff will be able to keep the cash if they wait for a year before taking up a new post.

It has previously been claimed that more than one in six managers and administrators given payouts worth as much as £650,000 are now back working in the health service.

More than 21,000 staff were made redundant under the coalition's controversial health reforms, which saw Primary Care Trusts axed and replaced with GP-led commission groups.

Each time an update has been published about the numbers returning to the NHS, the government has insisted it is getting a grip on the programme.

However, ministers have admitted the numbers have risen again, including 2,502 in permanent roles and 1,870 on fixed-term contracts. 

Labour frontbencher Lucy Powell, who obtained the figures, said: 'This revolving door is further evidence of the chaos and waste David Cameron's NHS reorganisation has created. 

'The health service is on its knees under the Tories. Only Labour will save our NHS.'

The taxpayer has paid more than £2million buying smartphones and iPads for bureaucrats in new NHS quangos.

Thousands of iPhones and tablet computers have been bought for staff at NHS England and Public Health England, set up under the coalition's reforms to save money for the health service.

Data released by health minister Dan Poulter shows that NHS England and Public Health England, both formed last year, were the biggest spenders on iPads and iPhones.

NHS England bought 115 iPads and 400 iPhones in the year before it was officially launched in April 2013, and since then has bought another 150 iPads and 1,900 ipads. The quango's total bill comes to £1.2million.

Public Health England, also formed last year, has spent a total of £530,000 on 2,036 iPhones and £113,743 on 65 iPads.

In response to a parliamentary question, health minister Dan Poulter said: 'The number of National Health Service staff estimated to have been made redundant since May 2010 and subsequently, up until July 2014, re-employed by an NHS organisation on a permanent basis is 2,502 and a fixed term contract basis is 1,870.'

Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: 'This scandalous waste of money cannot be justified when cancer patients are waiting longer for treatment. 

'Nurses denied a modest pay rise will find it galling to see David Cameron's been handing out cheques like confetti to people who have now been rehired. 

'On his watch, we have seen pay-offs for managers and pay cuts for nurses. 

'Cameron's top-down re-organisation has wasted £3 billion and left the NHS in a weak financial position. Nurses are paying the price for his mismanagement of the NHS.' 

The figure has risen by 422 to 4,372 since an update for November 2013.

The total cost to the NHS of 'revolving door' payments has not been revealed but with the average redundancy payment being £48,000, it could mean more than £200million has been squandered on pay-offs for returning staff since 2010.

The Department of Health says its 'bureaucracy-busting reforms'  are saving £1.5billion a year, with 13,500 more frontline staff and 7,000 fewer managers in the NHS since May 2010.

A Tory source said the 'big redundancy bills are down to Labour rules and Labour contracts - negotiated with Labour's union friends'. 

Under new rules announced by the Treasury last month, the law will be changed so that anyone earning more than £100,000 who returns to the same part of public sector within 12 months of taking redundancy will have to return all or part of their pay-off.

It is expected the measure - which is included in the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill currently going through Parliament - will mainly affect NHS and local government administrators.

The Treasury said that of the 19,000 NHS administrators made redundant between 2010 and 2013, almost 20 per cent rejoined the NHS while 16 per cent of local government chief executives who left by mutual agreement between 2007 and 2009 had been employed by another council within a year.  

Almost all of the public sector will be covered by the measures, including the Civil Service, local government and the NHS.

Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'It's only fair that highly-paid executives who receive a redundancy pay-out from the public purse and then quickly return to the same part of the public sector repay the taxpayer.

'Reforming the public sector so it works for Britain has been a key part of this government's drive to create a stronger economy and fairer society.'

Family affair: Karen Straughair and husband Chris Reed received six-figure pay-offs from NHS trusts but both got jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust

Among the staff paid off on huge sums before returning  were a husband-and-wife team of NHS managers who walked away with £1million in combined redundancies straight into six-figure salary posts.

Karen Straughair, 50, pocketed more than £605,000 when NHS South of Tyne and Wear, where she was chief executive, was wound up at the end of March 2013.

Her husband Chris Reed, chief executive of NHS North of Tyne, was paid more than £345,000 when his organisation was abolished.

By June last year both had board-level jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust – Mr Reed as interim chief executive, Miss Straughair as recovery director. 

Today it emerged the couple earned a total of £120,000 while in the temporary management posts at hospitals in Leeds, West Yorks.

Dia Chakravarty, political director at the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'This is yet another outrageous example of the 'revolving door' culture in the NHS, which hits taxpayers twice - once in the form of pay-offs and then again in the form of new salaries.

'This is exactly the sort of bad management and lack of foresight we simply cannot afford in the public sector, particularly at a time when hard-pressed families are having to budget to make ends meet.'
