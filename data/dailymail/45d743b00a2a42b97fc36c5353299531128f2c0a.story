Two diaries written by a soldier during the First World War have been unearthed by a museum with curators puzzling about what they could contain because they are written in shorthand.

York Castle Museum came across the books in boxes of World War One archive material before Christmas, after they were donated by the East Riding Yeomanry Old Comrades Association.

Curators at the museum are excited about finding the 100 year-old diaries, but are equally frustrated that they cannot understand what they say, as it seems closer to Pitman shorthand than written English.

One of the diaries that was donated to the museum. The museum continues to make a public appeal to find people who might be able to decipher them

Experts will be consulted in order to try and decode the diaries which seem to be written in a from of written code that closely resembles shorthand that is used by journalists and secretaries. 

Using a card that was found with the diaries the museum have deduced that the diaries might contain details of the Palestine campaign fought between the British Empire, Ottoman and German empires between 1915 and 1918.

The dates in the diary appear cover the period in which battles were fought in Gaza, Nazareth and Jerusalem.

Curator at the museum, Katie Brown, said: 'It was a surprise to find them.

'We found a card with the diaries that say they are the shorthand diaries of the Palestine Campaign in 1917-1918, written by Wass Reader of the 1st East Riding Yeomanry C Squadron.'

The museum is looking for people that might be able to decipher some of the text, which might show a bit about the soldiers life in the campaign he fought in.

Katie said: 'We don’t know what kind of shorthand it uses - it could be a military style - so we would love to hear from people with expertise in military shorthand.

The diaries have to be handled very delicately like most older objects, but the difference with these books is that repeated handling runs the risk of smudging the print, leaving them truly undecipherable

'It would be fantastic if volunteers from the pubic could give us any insight as to the content of the diaries and tell us more about the shorthand itself.

'The name Wass Reader is very unusual, so if anyone recognises that name we would like to hear from them as well.'

'It’s frustrating because we don’t even really know when we acquired the diaries. We want to know whether this is a record of someone’s personal opinions on the war, or the mundane details of his day-to-day life. 

'We also want to know more about York’s links in the war as well, and these come from a local regiment.

The diaries are even more intriguing because they come from the Palestine campaign, a part of the war that is not as well known as the European campaigns.'

The Sinai and Palestine conflict of WWI is often overlooked, but it was one of the major theaters of war at the time. 

It began as an offensive by the Ottoman Empire on the Suez Canal in 1915, and ended in 1918 with an armistice.

After an unsuccessful attack by the Ottoman Empire in 1916, Britain went on the offensive, attacking into Palestine.

Late in 1917, the British captured Gaza and Jerusalem.

Hostilities officially ended on October 30, 1918 with the signing of the Armistice of Mudros.

During the campaign, the British also worked to start an Arab revolt in present-day Saudi Arabia.

The revolt against the Ottoman forces began in 1916 and was planned and directed by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Edward Lawrence of the British army, also known as Lawrence of Arabia.

The British death toll reached 550,000, but more than 90% of these were not battle losses but instead because of disease, heat and other causes.

Total Ottoman losses are unknown but were probably larger. A whole army was lost in the fighting and huge numbers of troops were led into combat.

The British conquest of Palestine led to the creation of the states of Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.
