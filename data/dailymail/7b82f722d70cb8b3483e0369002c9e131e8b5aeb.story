This little girl certainly knows what happiness is to her: Candy.

Danny Brooks from Spring, Texas, filmed his three-year-old daughter Ashlynn putting her own spin on Pharrell's hit track Happy. 

The toddler is seen enthusiastically singing completely different lyrics in a duet with her father while riding in the car. 

Most of her words center around unhappiness.

'Can't be happy,' she says, with her father responding,' why don't we know how to be happy?'

Ashlynn says that no one can crack a smile because they're 'still mad'. 

She later adds that she wants to cry.

'Why do you want to cry?' her concerned father sings back. 'What if I give you candy, does that make you happy?' he then suggests.

Ashlynn responds with a big 'yeah'. She then pulls a big smile, concluding 'I love candy.'

As an FYI to her father, she adds that her favorite candy is a 'triangle'.
