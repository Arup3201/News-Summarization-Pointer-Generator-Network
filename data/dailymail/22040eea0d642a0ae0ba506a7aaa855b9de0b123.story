MPs should be given their promised 11 per cent pay rise, the deputy Commons speaker has declared.

Labour’s Lindsay Hoyle warned party leaders against trying to block the £7,600 pay hike drawn up by the expenses watchdog.

He warned David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg that they must not dictate ‘what is good for backbenchers’ by trying to block the increase from the current level of £65,000.

Defence: Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle said it was wrong for political leaders to 'dictate' what backbenchers earn

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority brushed aside public anger in July to announce salaries for MPs should rise to £74,000 from 2015.

The dramatic rise will leave MPs earning roughly three times the national average salary and comes at a time when most other public sector workers have had pay rises capped at just one per cent.

All the main party leaders rounded on Ipsa for ignoring the public mood when recommending the rise.

But Mr Hoyle said it was not ‘fair’ for those who earn more money to try to ‘dictate’ what rank and file backbenchers should earn.

‘I can see that leaders need to represent. It's about them being the next prime minister or continuing as prime minister,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Westminster Hour.

‘But in the end backbenchers need a voice and the voice was taken away by giving it to IPSA.

‘IPSA have come forward with a recommendation. It isn't in my opinion the right of leaders to say what is good for backbenchers.’

IPSA was set up in the wake of the 2009 expenses scandal to end the practice of MPs setting their own pay and perks.

IPSA chairman Sir Ian Kennedy argued that MPs’ pay has fallen behind in recent years – and warn that failure to reward MPs more generously risks a repeat of the 2009 expenses scandal.

Mr Hoyle added: ‘If IPSA had come back and said no pay increase, which it's done for the last few years, nobody minds and everybody accepts it.

‘But don't change the rules if you don't quite like the result.

‘It's not up to leaders to start dictating, like it's not up to me to dictate to other MPs.

‘We're on slightly more money than other backbenchers and therefore we shouldn't be saying that you shouldn't have a pay rise. I don't think that's fair.

‘Let the MPs decide or leave it as it is -
 with what we agreed with the press and the public that it's independent
 of Parliament and that's where I think it should remain.’

Prime Minister David Cameron said a pay rise for MPs would be 'unthinkable' while Deputy PM Nick Clegg said it was 'about the worst time' to increase MPs' pay

MPs’ expenses are back in the headlines after it emerged hundreds of politicians– including Labour leader Mr Miliband – have together claimed a total of £200,000 on expenses to pay their energy bills.

Politicians have claimed up to £6,000 each for gas and electricity in their second homes, leaving hard-pressed taxpayers to pick up the bill.

Some 340 MPs, some of them multi-millionaires, have taken advantage of the perk at a time when many people are struggling to pay rising utility bills.

When the pay rise was first announced, Mr Miliband said he would not take it  but predicted that Ipsa would change its mind after feeling the wrath of voters in the consultation.

Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg said it was 'about the worst time' to increase MPs' pay and urged the public to bombard IPSA's consultation with angry opposition.

Mr Cameron branded the rise ‘unthinkable, while Education Secretary Michael Gove told the 'silly' expenses watchdog which recommended the £7,600 increase they could 'stick it'.
