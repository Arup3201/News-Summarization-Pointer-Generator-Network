Residents in Quincy, Massachusetts are growing increasingly concerned about who or what has been flying about their city from dusk til dawn for the past 10 days.

Almost every night for the past two weeks, residents have spotted - and heard - a low-flying aircraft doing loops over the city.

At least person has captured an image of the plane which has at least helped to confirm that, despite suspicions, it isn’t a drone. The photograph revealed a Cessna single-engine airplane, which is a maned vehicle.

Locals are in the dark as to what the plane is doing and who's doing it. The Federal Aviation Administration know, but will only confirm that it is a sanctioned flight,

'It’s frustrating, it really is,' City Councillor Brian Palmucci told WBZ.

'I specifically asked, "Is it a law enforcement flight? Can we tell people that?" He said, "No, we can’t tell you that."

'Then I asked that when folks call me can I at least tell them that it is something that they shouldn’t worry about, it’s something they shouldn’t be concerned with? He said, "I can’t tell you that.'"

‘It’s frightening, not just weird, but frightening,’ another resident told WBZ.

The only nights in the past two weeks when the aircraft hasn't flown have been when it has been cloudy or raining.

For many residents, the purpose of the flights is less important than finding out when the noisy exploits are going to end.

'We’re very reasonable people,' Jennifer Azevedo-Andre, told Boston.com.

'There may be a valid reason for them to be covert, to explain it might undermine its purpose, but I can tolerate for so long and no one can give us a timetable of when it will stop.'
