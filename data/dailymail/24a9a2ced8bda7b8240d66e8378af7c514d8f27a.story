Review: Manslaughter charges against firework display organiser Geoffrey Counsell, who was accused after seven people died in a pile-up on the M5, have been dropped

Manslaughter charges against a firework display organiser accused after seven people died in a horrific pile-up on the M5 have been dropped.

Geoffrey Counsell, 50, from Somerset, was operating a firework display close to the motorway at Taunton Rugby Club at the time of the crash in November 2011.

The pile-up, which involved 34 vehicles, was described as one of the worst British motorway crashes in memory.

Witnesses afterwards spoke of thick smoke causing visibility problems for motorists.

Anthony and Pamela Adams, Maggie and Michael Barton, Malcolm Beacham, Terry Brice and Kye Thomas all died.

Counsell was charged with seven counts of manslaughter on October 19 last year.

But when he appeared at Bristol Crown Court today he was told the manslaughter charges were being dropped and he would instead face a charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act of failing to ensure the safety of others.

Peter Blair, prosecuting, said they had reviewed the decision following meetings with a range of experts in different disciplines.

'The outcome of the review that took place and developments, including the additional charge of failing to ensure the safety of others under the Health and Safety Act, was the decision that the prosecution will not be pursuing the manslaughter charges,' he said.

'It is the prosecution’s intention that Mr Counsell will be proceeded against under the Health and Safety Act.'

Adrian Derbyshire, defending, told the court his client should 'never have been charged with manslaughter'.

But he added the prosecution told him it was the right decision at the time and new evidence had come forward that prompted the decision to review the case.

Judge Neil Ford QC said the case would now be marked as a closed file.Counsell left court without comment.

Relatives of the seven people who died in the pile-up said their torment goes on after the manslaughter charges were dropped.

Leaving court today, Tonia White, 49, 
whose parents Mr and Mrs Adams were killed on their way back from 
visiting the family in Taunton, said the torment for the families goes 
on.

She said: 'It’s been a very traumatic experience.

'However
we’re confident in the justice system and although the CPS have 
discontinued the charges of manslaughter, we are led to believe there 
will be health and safety issues to address.'

Mrs White was supported by her 24-year-old daughter, Terri, as she fought back tears.She said she could not describe how she feels about the manslaughter charges being dropped.

'I
think we are all still very traumatised and hurt and we’re grieving, 
and I don’t think that that’s an answer we can give you.'

Asked if the torment is still going on she said: 'Yes, very much so, very much so.'

Jean Brice, from Bedminster, 
Bristol - whose eldest son died in the crash - left court with her 
husband, 83-year-old Terry Brice.

The 79-year-old said: 'It’s a very sensitive case, but what can we say.

'It won’t stop the cruelty and misery that we two 80-year-olds have to go through for the rest of our days.'

The collision involved 34 vehicles and witnesses spoke of thick smoke causing visibility problems for motorists.

Friends and family of the deceased filled the public gallery in the court room to hear the charges dropped.

Senior investigation officer for the M5 collision, Detective Superintendent Mike Courtiour, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'The collision on the M5 in November 2011 was one of the worst in living memory.

'Fifty one people were injured and seven people tragically lost their lives.

'We launched a comprehensive investigation immediately after to establish the full circumstances which led to the collision.

'Our investigation was meticulous and complex. We took hundreds of witness statements, examined 34 vehicles and consulted several experts, including meteorologists, pyrotechnic and forensic specialists.

'Based on this evidence the Crown Prosecution Service took a decision to charge. However, following further consideration in recent weeks they have decided to drop the manslaughter charges.'

He added that while Health and Safety proceedings are continuing they are not able to comment any further.

Barry Hughes, chief crown prosecutor 
for CPS South West, said: 'During this review process in December, we 
sought further advice from a leading expert on the law of negligence and
additional information was also provided by expert witnesses and police
investigators.

'Based on this additional information and advice, it 
has been decided that there is insufficient evidence to continue with a 
prosecution for manslaughter, which will be discontinued by tomorrow.

'Mr Counsell will shortly be charged with an offence under the Health and Safety at Work Act.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
