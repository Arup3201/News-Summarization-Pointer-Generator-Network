A movie crew was working on train 
tracks without permission from the railroad when a freight train crashed
 into the production team and its equipment, killing one and injuring 
seven others, a sheriff's investigator said Friday.

Joe 
Gardner, the lead detective on the case, said the crew had Rayonier's 
permission to film on its property next to the train tracks.

'CSX has told me they were aware they were out there, but they did 
not have permission to be on the train tracks,' Gardner told reporters.

Casualty: 27-year-old Sarah Elizabeth Jones of Atlanta, a camera assistant, was killed in the deadly accident

"That's a very active train track,' he said. 'There's probably 
anywhere from up to 10 trains a day that go through on those tracks.'

The Savannah-based crew was shooting footage for 'Midnight Rider,' a 
film based on the life of singer Gregg Allman, when the crash happened 
Thursday afternoon.

Wayne County sheriff's detectives were working 
Friday to piece together how and why it happened.

The deadly collision took place at a railroad trestle that crosses 
the Altamaha River in the rural county about 60 miles southwest of 
Savannah. The tracks, owned by CSX Railroad, cross private land owned by
 forest-products company Rayonier, which has a nearby paper mill.

The
 crew, and director Randall Miller, had been filming a dream sequence on
 a railroad, when the train suddenly appeared on the bridge they were 
on.

Miller,
 who reportedly fell on the tracks as the crew tried to get out of the 
train's path, is working on a film about the life of musician Gregg 
Allman.

His crew had 
been prepared for two trains to pass by as they filmed at about 4pm on 
Thursday. They had placed a bed on a bridge in Doctortown when a train 
driver blew his whistle to alert them to an unexpected third train.

The
 team had less than a minute to try to clear the track and get off the 
bridge before the train, which was heading to Savannah, passed by, Variety reported.

A photographer pulled Miller to safety after the director fell on the tracks while trying to move the bed.

The
 rest of the eight-man crew were still leaving the bridge as the train 
went past, striking and killing the second camera assistant, and 
throwing debris from the set into the air.

The train struck and killed a woman identified by the sheriff's 
department as 27-year-old Sarah Elizabeth Jones of Atlanta.

Jones was a camera assistant.

Seven others 
were injured, one seriously enough to be taken by helicopter to a 
Savannah hospital. Further information on their conditions was not 
immediately available Friday.

Trespassing onto railroad tracks is illegal under Georgia law and punishable as a misdemeanor.

The film studio Friday referred calls to a Los Angeles publicist, 
Nadine Jolson, who did not immediately return phone calls seeking 
comment but emailed a brief statement.

'All of us on the production team are devastated by the tragic 
accident that happened today,' the studio's statement said. 'Our 
thoughts and prayers are with the family of our crew member.'

CSX issued a statement saying the railroad company was 'deeply 
saddened' by the crash and cooperating with investigators. It provided 
no further details other than to say the train involved was traveling to
 Savannah from Memphis, Tenn.

A CSX spokeswoman, Kristin Seay, declined to comment further and 
would not confirm that film crew had no permission from the railroad to 
be working on the train tracks.

Authorities provided few details about the collision. Gardner said it
 wasn't clear if crew members were actually on the trestle bridging the 
river or just on the tracks at the river's edge.

He said the train 
smashed some of the crew's equipment, and it's possible some of the 
injuries were caused by flying debris. Among the items found on the 
tracks was what appeared to be a mattress for a bed, Gardner said.

It also wasn't clear if the film crew was waiting to film a train or was caught unaware by one approaching, Gardner said.

In a statement, train company CSX said it had been 'deeply saddened by a tragedy'. 

It added: 'Initial reports indicate that at least 
three people were injured, one fatally.  CSX personnel are working with 
first responders to meet the needs of those injured.'

A
 spokeswoman for the production company told Mail Online: 'All of us on 
the production team are devastated by the tragic accident. Our thoughts 
and prayers are with the family of our crew member.'

Production
 of the film about the Allman Brothers' frontman had only begun this 
month. The film is due to star William Hurt and Tyson Ritter as Allman 
in different stages of his life.
