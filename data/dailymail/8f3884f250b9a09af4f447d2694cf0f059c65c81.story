Policemen from Romania and Poland are being drafted in to help British forces combat an Eastern European crimewave.

Scotland Yard has recruited the officers, who have flown to the capital for a two-year ‘tour of duty’ to help identify and deport overseas offenders.

The move comes ahead of the lifting of border controls on immigrants from Romania in two months’ time.

London beat: Romanian policemen in the capital

The special squad, comprising eight detectives from Romania and three officers from Poland, will join the Metropolitan Police on raids, interviews and working in custody suites to crosscheck records with their own police database.

But they will have no powers of arrest or any other powers of the traditional British bobby. The unprecedented move comes after it emerged last year that 28 per cent of the 300,000 suspects the Metropolitan Police arrests each year were foreign nationals, with Poles and Romanians at the top of the list.

More than 27,000 Romanian citizens have been held for serious offences in London in the past five years, including ten for murder, 142 for rape and 666 for other sex offences.

Earlier this month, Roma beggars were targeted by police in Westminster with help from Romanian officers

The number of Romanians arrested is second only to that of Poles, 34,905 of whom have been detained since 2008, including 84 for murder. Police hope that the new unit will disrupt major organised criminal networks.

Under the scheme, whose £1.7million cost will be met by the EU, the foreign officers will be deployed on rotation in London for two years.

The arrangement will allow the Met to gain access to national police computers in Romania and Poland, enabling them to fast-track the exchange of intelligence and forensic science data.

The officers, who speak English, will operate mostly in plain-clothes roles but be able to wear their national uniforms if a situation requires it. They will tackle a wide variety of migrant crime from low-level offences such as begging to human trafficking, serious sexual assaults and money laundering.

Earlier this year it emerged that the Met had approached a number of countries in the hope of recruiting a 30-strong international squad.

It is still in talks with police in Lithuania and Ireland to join the unit, which is part of Operation Nexus, a 100-strong squad set up last year to target foreign nationals committing crime in the capital.

Since its launch, 700 rapists, burglars, thieves, fraudsters, gang members and other offenders have been removed from Britain’s streets.

Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley has said: ‘This is about being good at dealing with offenders wherever they come from.’
