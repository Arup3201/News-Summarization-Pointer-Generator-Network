Six months after Greg Pembroke launched the hit Tumblr account Reasons My Son Is Crying documenting his kids' hilarious temper tantrums, the upstate New York dad has become a published author.

Pembroke's new book titled Reasons My Kid Is Crying features photos of toddlers sent to him by parents from around the world in the midst of epic meltdowns, supplemented by tongue-in-cheek captions explaining why the kids weep.

One of the photos featured in the book shows a boy wailing next to a little girl sitting inside a supermarket shopping cart above a caption that reads: ‘He didn't want to share his leg hole.'

Tears and laughter: Greg Pembroke, the dad behind the hit Tumblr page Reasons My Son Is Crying, has turned his online photo project into a book

Greg Pembroke started his photo project in April by photographing his sons amidst meltdowns

Another picture in the volume set to be published in the U.S. next spring shows a sullen little boy bawling because 'his aunt wouldn't let him play with an ax.'

On a similar note, another page in Pembroke’s opus shows a baby dismayed that his dad would not let him drown in a pond.

The book published by Pan Macmillan and its imprint Boxtree will go on sale in the UK Thursday with a price tag of £9.99.

The compact 192-page volume will be released in the U.S. next April, followed by a German edition.

For Pembroke, it all started last April when the married father of two from Rochester, New York, began taking photos of his sons, Charlie and William, mid-tantrums, and posting them online with funny captions explaining why his boys were in tears.

The first image of Pembroke's sobbing 3-year-old son had a tagline that read: 'I broke this cheese in half.' At the time, the dad had no way of knowing that the image of his boy crying over a broken dairy product would end up on the cover of his book.

Pembroke, who writes commercials for radio stations, initially amused himself by sharing images and captions on his personal Facebook page.

But when his light-hearted hobby attracted attention from friends and acquaintances eager to spread the word about his side project, Pembroke decided to launch a Tumblr page, which he dubbed Reasons My Son Is Crying.

The photo blog went viral within a week, earning Pembroke and his family an invitation to appear on Good Morning America. Other media outlets, both domestic and international, also showed interest in Pembroke's unusual endeavor.

By popular demand: Pembroke's friends were eager to share the images of blubbering babies with a wider audience, which promoted him to create the Tumblr blog

Global phenomenon: The blog has drawn media attention in the U.S. and abroad, leaving Pembroke inundated with pictures of hysterical toddlers sent to him by parents from as far as China

Speaking to MailOnline in August, Pembroke said: 'It's so interesting. I started it for a bit of fun, and it got big completely by accident. The first photo we did was the cheese one. I broke it in half after he asked me to, and when he got upset I thought his reaction was so hilariously unreasonable. It went from there.'

Over the past six months, Pembroke has been receiving emails from parents from as far as Australia and China sharing pictures of their own blubbering babies.
