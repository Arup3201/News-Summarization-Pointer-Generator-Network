Ranjan Madugalle, of the ICC's match referees elite panel, ruled that England were one over short of their target.

Alastair Cook was docked 20 per cent of his match fee and his team-mates were handed 10 per cent penalties.

The ICC stated: 'If Cook is found guilty of one more minor over-rate offence in ODIs over the next 12 months, he will receive a one-match suspension as per the provisions of the ICC code of conduct for players and player support personnel.

'The offence is contrary to article 2.5.1 of the code which relates to minor over-rate offences. The penalty was accepted by England without contest so there was no need for a hearing.'
