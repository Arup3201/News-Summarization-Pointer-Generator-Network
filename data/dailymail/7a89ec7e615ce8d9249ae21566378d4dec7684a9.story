STEVIE THE EMBLEM 

To get an idea how much of an emblem Steven Gerrard is to Liverpool, you only had to take a glance through the match programme and look at The Kop.

Before kick-off, a banner was unveiled proclaiming him 'the best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be' in homage to the LA Galaxy-bound talisman.

More intriguing, though, were the 11 images of him in the programme. His commercial worth to Liverpool is huge, as he was the main face on every sponsored page. Who will possibly fill that void when he is gone?

JOSE IN GAME MODE 

Watching Jose Mourinho is an experience in itself and from the moment he emerged out of the tunnel, you could tell he was in game mode.

Ditching his usual smart attire, Mourinho wore a tracksuit, overcoat and snood and that casual ensemble sparked memories of the way he was dressed for the game that decided the title race on April 27.

It was also interesting when Chelsea's supporters began taunting Steven Gerrard for that slip. Mourinho was not impressed, looking at the away section and shaking his head.

CHELSEA'S WATERFRONT WARM-UP 

Visitors to Liverpool's waterfront on Monday morning would have been taken aback to see something other than the Liver Birds and the famous ferry across the Mersey.

During their traditional pre-match stroll, Chelsea's squad – who were staying in the near-by Malmaisson Hotel – started doing a warm-up to get them ready for the challenge.

It might not have been the manicured pitches of Cobham but, for Jose Mourinho, the cobbles of the Pier Head certainly had the designated effect. 

MISSING MARIO 

No sign of Mario Balotelli at Anfield again and he let the world know his whereabouts by posting a picture of himself at home on Instagram.

Balotelli, whose last start for Liverpool was against Chelsea on November 8, was, according to Brendan Rodgers, ill with a chest infection last week, which is why he missed he trip to Aston Villa.

He was photographed out in Manchester over the weekend and then on Monday morning informed Rodgers he was still under the weather. It is now, surely, a question of 'when' rather than 'if' there is parting of the ways.
