The last words of a New South Wales homicide detective who took his own life while suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder have been revealed.

Former detective sergeant Ashley Bryant served in the police service for 23 years but quit in December 2012 after many attempts to overcome the traumas he had experienced on the job.

A year later, Mr Bryant was at Minyon Falls - in NSW's Northern Rivers region - making his last call to 000 before he ended his life.

Even in his final moments, the former police officer who dedicated his life to saving others tried to prevent more  from being lost. 

In a recording played on Channel Seven's Sunday Night, Mr Bryant asked the operator to listen to him and made a plea to authorities to do more for those who suffered from PTSD.

'I understand that this is being recorded and I suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. I can no longer live with the trauma of it and I want this to go to the coroner,' he said.

The father-of-three added more needed to also be done for the partners of police officers who suffered from the mental health illness.

The operator asks him if he can hold off until emergency services arrived but Mr Bryant said he could not, replying: 'I'll be gone before they arrive.'

NSW Police Minister Stuart Ayres told the news program in a written statement that the welfare of officers remained 'one of my highest priorities'.

But Mr Bryant's wife Deborah, who played the recording to reporter Melissa Doyle in an emotional interview, has called for more support for officers who suffered mental illness - in particular PTSD. 

Ms Bryant said her husband - who recruited to Unsolved Homicide Team in 2007 - saw many things on the job which led to the deterioration of his mental health.

But she said it took him years before he sought help because he did not want to seem like he was not coping with the demands of the job.

'In the early days, there was always incidents he would come home obviously very affected... whether it be motor vehicle accidents or self-harm,' Ms Bryant told Sunday Night.

'It was really heartbreaking to see that strong person become a shell of himself.'

When Ashley Bryant finally sought help in January 2012, he was diagnosed with PTSD and was prescribed anti-depressants and sleeping pills.

Despite a three-week stint in a rehabilitation clinic, the proud detective made the tough choice to walk away from his two-decade long career with the police service.

But Mr Bryant's story is not an isolated one.

According to Sunday Night, one in five NSW police officers are suffering from PTSD and in the past two years there have been five times more deaths in police officers as a result of taking their own life than those on duty.

But Mr Bryant's case is not the only one. Allan Sparkes said he had also contemplated taking his own life but after a decade of therapy he no longer suffers from PTSD

While Jeff Garland is still suffering from the disorder after five years on the job

Allan Sparkes is a former police officer who has contemplated suicide after the 1978 Hilton Hotel bombing in Sydney, which killed three people, and the double murder of two colleagues in 1995.

The final straw for Mr Sparkes was the rescue of a boy who was trapped in a manhole during flooding in 1996, which earned him and his partner crosses of valour.

But the screams of the young child - who almost died that day - haunted him from that day forward and led to him to contemplate taking his own life.

Luckily for Mr Sparkes, he was able to get help and overcome the disorder after a decade of therapy.

Similar circumstances also led to Jeff Garland quitting the force after five years.

In 2001, he was involved in a high speed pursuit where he was trapped on the back of a ute while trying to capture a suspect.

'I thought I'm going to die here,' Mr Garland said.

This was not the first incident he had faced and the culmination of the trauma of these events led to his mental health deteriorating.

'I'd go to work and sit in my car and cry. I'd be late for work... because I couldn't do it anymore,' Mr Garland said. 

NSW Police Minister Stuart Ayres said he was 'committed' to improving the welfare of officers and the state government had invested $15 million in 'welfare-focused programs', including PTSD.

'The NSW Police Force now has over 79 activities and initiatives in place to promote wellbeing and prevent injury, improve injury management, and rehabilitate and redeploy injured officers,' Mr Ayres said.

Specific programs for those with PTSD included mental health intervention team, 24-hour trauma support and a peer support program managed by a psychologist, and new deployment guidelines and psychological job analysis tools for injured officers.

Those needing help or someone to speak to, can call Lifeline (Australia) on 131 114, the Suicide Prevention Lifeline (U.S.) on 1-800-273-8255 or Samaritans (U.K.) on 08457 90 90 90.
