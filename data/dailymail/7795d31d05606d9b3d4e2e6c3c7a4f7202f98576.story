Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment responsible for television show Sleepy Hollow's Season One DVD release issued an apology today after launching a #HeadlessDay promotion campaign on the same day a second U.S. journalist was beheaded by ISIS in Iraq.

Sleepy Hollow released a series of memes with various headless jokes because the show's antagonist just so happens to be the Headless Horseman.

The Headless Day promo was emailed to the press shortly after word broke that journalist Steven Sotloff had been beheaded by ISIS militants in Iraq, reports Deadline.com

Apologized: Reps for Sleepy Hollow, a show about a Headless Horseman, apologized for launching their Headless Day campaign on the same day journalist Steven Sotloff was beheaded by ISIS

Bad Timing: Even though the show's antagonist is the Headless Horseman, the timing of their ad campaign couldn't be worse

Beheaded: The ad campaign came out on the same day journalist Steve Sotloff (pictured) was beheaded

Hairy situation: Though memes like this one were meant to be a joke, the campaign was cancelled because its timing was inappropriate

The promo was also emailed just 14 days after the first American journalist James Foley was beheaded by ISIS.

'We apologize for the unfortunate timing of our Sleepy Hollow Headless Day announcement. The tragic news of Steven Sotloff’s death hit the web as the email was being sent.

Our deepest sympathies are with him and his family, and we don’t take the news lightly. Had we have known this information prior, we would have never released the alert and realize it’s in poor taste,' wrote a rep for Sleepy Hollow.

The campaign featuring Headless Horseman jokes has since been pulled, reports TMZ.

'Does this axe make my head look small?' says one meme portraying a cartoon of the headless Horseman holding a large axe.

'With hair like this, I think I'd rather be headless, says another meme of a woman with a tousled head of hair.

'I knew you'd forget your head if it wasn't attached,' says another.

A rep for the digital marketing agency ThinkJam responsible for the campaign said that FOX pre-approved the memes.

They also said that the campaign #HeadlessDay was scheduled in advance to go out yesterday 'as a lighthearted way to celebrate the title.'

They also said it was sent 'to [journalists]' they thought 'would enjoy it.'
