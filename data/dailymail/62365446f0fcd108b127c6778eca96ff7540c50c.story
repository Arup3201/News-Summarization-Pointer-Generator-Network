She was blasted during 2011's X Factor by Simon Cowell, who said she looked as though she was wearing  five gallons of hairspray before standing in the middle of a hurricane.

Never one to take the music mogul's criticism lying down, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has returned to top sartorial form on this year's show.

After a  four-year hiatus from the talent contest, Cheryl returned to our screens - along with a new surname and whole new dress sense - and successfully stole back her fashion crown.

Style overhaul: Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has used this year's X Factor to reinvent her style and beauty

And, we can reveal, the 31-year-old singer has a carefully curated 'dream team' of experts to thank.

Heading up Cheryl's new glam squad is stylist Anna Hughes-Chamberlain, who is the senior fashion editor of  style bible, Hunger magazine, and has worked with Miranda Kerr, Sienna Miller and Ellie Goulding.

Anna has helped Cheryl shake up her wardrobe and break away from the play-it-safe style she has previously embraced.

In 2010, Cheryl came under fire for her 'tacky' and 'skimpy' dresses, while Dannii Minogue was lauded for her 'edgy and fashion forward' fashion choices and hairstyles.

Cheryl took matters into her own hands this year by enlisting Anna. The super stylist added glamorous gowns courtesy of Vogue favourites, Christopher Kane, Monique Lhuillier, Zuhair Murad and Stephane Rolland, to the judge's wardrobe.

The judge, who sits alongside Mel B and Louis Walsh, also had couture wedding dress designer, Alida Herbst, waiting in the wings to help Anna.

Alida is an extremely talented designer and seamstress who has worked with many of the world’s top designers and played a leading part in making the wedding dresses of plenty of high-profile private clients.

Classic in design or a touch avant garde, Alida promises that her designs will help you feel your best on your special day - something she's most certainly helped Cheryl with this year.

'I have worked with Cheryl's stylist Anna and Cheryl herself many times before. I designed her outfit for the Capital FM Summertime Ball at Wembley earlier this year and created about 25 dresses for her Girls Aloud Ten tour,' Alida told FEMAIL.

Alida, who went along to the live shows every week to help Cheryl and Anna, said that Cheryl is 'lovely' to work with and has a really good sense of humour.

'Cheryl has been looking so good on X Factor,' added Alida. 

Couture: High-fashion houses have been lending Cheryl the most glamorous and lavish of dresses, which she's pulled off with aplomb week after week (left, in Lanvin, and, right, in Ziad Nakad)

Speaking about Cheryl's style overhaul, fashion writer Simon Glazin (www.theverysimong.com) said: 'Cheryl has come a long way since the shiny Kappa tracksuit days. She wouldn't be seen dead in one now. For her, it's all about the super high-end designers now.

'Alas, even couture houses have started lending her dresses. And, it seems, Cheryl is doing a better job at championing new designers than our very own Princess, Kate Middleton.

'Cheryl's fashion conquests have included: Thakoon - famed for dressing the First Lady herself; Monique Lhuillier - a red carpet gown genius; Zuhair Murad (including the red dress she wore for the final) - one of Jennifer Lopez's favourite designers, and Stephane Rolland couture - one of the most fantastic couturiers in the world, who dresses royals and A list stars.

'Granted, sometimes Cheryl gets it a tad wrong, some of the dresses she has worn look a little cheap on her, but overall, I've been impressed with the dresses her stylist has managed to pull in.

What a difference! Speaking about Cheryl's style overhaul, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'Cheryl has come a long way since the shiny Kappa tracksuit days. She wouldn't be seen dead in one now. For her, it's all about the super high-end designers now' 

'She is at her best when she's in a long, sweeping gown, one that accentuates her waist, bust and delicate neck line. And she isn't afraid of colour, which is refreshing.

'I think my favourite of all her looks was the green Lanvin ruffle detail dress. I thought it would have been reserved for a Hollywood A-lister, not an ex-Girl Aloud!'.

Another important member of Cheryl's glam squad is Paul Percival - one half of hair styling power duo, Percy & Reed. Their client list includes Sophie Dahl, Diane Kruger, Agyness Deyn, Anna Friel - and now Cheryl.

Paul, who also tends to the tresses of Rita Ora and Mark Ronson for their VIP appearances and magazine shoots, worked backstage with the singer every weekend and was on hand between takes.

Only the best for Chez: Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has called on Paul Percival, a fashion favourite and celebrity hairdresser, to work his magic on her X Factor hair

His signature clean, modern style has made him a backstage fashion week favourite and Cheryl - who married husband Jean-Bernard this year - has benefited.

Speaking to FEMAIL about working with the pop icon, he said: 'I have worked with Cheryl a few times over the years on different projects. 

'We both had big ideas about what we wanted to achieve this season. The main thing was that we wanted to create lots of different looks that were alternative, versatile and cool, rather than the hair being played safe all of the time. It was a really collaborative effort.' 

Cheryl, who, according to Paul, is very much involved in the creative process, has opted to channel French icons such as Brigitte Bardot some weeks and more urban, playful looks on others.

Get the look: Cheryl, who is heavily involved in her final look, apparently wanted to channel the eternal glamour of French actresses 

He says one of his favourites look this season was The Short and Sharp look he and Cheryl recently created because, he says, it was 'completely different to any of the other looks we have ever done before'. 

'We created what looked like a haircut rather than a hair style just by braiding the hair which was quite a bold thing to do,' he explained. 'I also really liked the Back to Bardot style we created a few weeks back. I know Cheryl really liked the Judge’s Houses because of great texture..

Always head of the game trend-wise, Paul and Cheryl championed the sleek ponytail a lot on the show, which, he says, is one of the easiest hair styles to recreate.

In terms of big news for 2015, he thinks what he calls ‘Up Cuts’ (similar to the ‘Short & Sharp’ look), will be big news.

'It’s just about creating shorter, sharper detailed silhouettes when putting the hair up,' he said.

Paul, who says he aims to create products with personality and a comfortable salon where egos are left at the door, added: ‘Working with Cheryl is such a pleasure. She is never afraid to try new things and it’s a real collaborative partnership.’ 

'My favourite thing about working with Cheryl is that she has fantastic eye to detail. Plus, Cheryl knows what she likes and what she doesn’t, but she’s fearless when it comes to trying out new styles.'

Despite the show finishing, this isn't the end of Cheryl and Paul's creative relationship. 

He revealed: 'I‘m looking forward to seeing Cheryl’s new music video we just shot. Percy & Reed are also in the process of producing some very exciting new products but it’s a little too early to share yet! There are some really exciting new looks and projects that I’m working on for next year which you can stay up to date with on my Instagram - @percyhair.'

Now and then: Back on 2011's X Factor, right, Simon Cowell described Cheryl's hair as 'the equivalent of five gallons of hair spray and then standing in the middle of a hurricane'. She swiftly called in a new style squad to give her today's look, left
