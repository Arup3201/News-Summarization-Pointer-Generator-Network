Eleven years ago, Susan Still, a married mother of three from upstate New York, fled her home after enduring years of verbal, emotional and physical abuse at the hands of her husband.

For Still, the final straw came in June 2003 when Ulner Lee Still, her husband of more than a decade, ordered their 13-year-old son to grab a camera and videotape him berating, punching and choking the terrified woman.

Mrs Still, 54, would later say that her offense that day was that she came into the room and asked her hot-tempered husband if he wanted to have lunch.

Today, she says, she has forgiven her husband, but will never forget the abuse she suffered.

New life: Susan Still, 54, is moving on with her life in the 11 years since she left her abusive husband. Video of her abuse, which her husband forced her son Dane to record, shocked the nation in 2003

Dazmann Still says he wants to see his father again and ask him about why he treated his mother so badly. Mrs Still said she blamed herself for years for her abuse 

 'I had to (forgive him),' she told Oprah. 

'I had to a long time ago in order for myself to move on and begin to rebuild a life.'

She says she has worked to move past the abuse. Her son Dazmann, however, who was forced to watch and video record as his mother was brutally beaten and berated, is still struggling to come to terms with what happened.

'I wanna talk to him about a lot and I've definitely thought about going back to see him,' Dazmann, now in his 20s, said.

'I have an option of him for his actions and what he did, but I don't really know him as a human being. And that is my next step.'

He said he is not sure he can ever forgive his father for what he did.   

The disturbing 51-minute assault that Dane recorded, with his younger brother watching from the sidelines, sent shockwaves around the country.

Violence erupts: After berating her and repeatedly calling her 'stupid' and 'heifer,'  Ulner Still lunged at Susan 

In the video, an enraged Ulner Lee Still is seen seated in a chair, with his wife standing meekly in front of him, and hurling insults at her.

He calls her 'stupid' 23 times and 'heifer' 28 times, uses foul-mouthed language in front of their kids, accuses her of infidelity and criticizes the way she looks.

The confrontation between the husband and wife then takes a violent turn when Mr Still roughly grabs Susan and pushes her onto the bed.

With the camera in his son's hands rolling, the father proceeds to kick and slap the terrified mother of three, throws her to the floor and tries to strangle her. 

In 2007, Susan Still appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss her horrifying experiences as a victim of domestic abuse. Around the same time, ABC’s 20/20 with Diane Sawyer aired a segment about the woman's ordeal.

By that time, Ulner Lee Still had been convicted of domestic violence and sentenced to 36 years - the longest prison term in the history of the state involving a case where the victim survived.

Key piece of evidence: The video of the assault would later help prosecutors convict Ulner Lee Still 

Oprah Winfrey has recently caught up with Susan Still and her two sons, 23-year-old Dazmann and his younger brother, Dane, for an episode of 'Oprah: Where Are They Now?'

Susan, who has spent the past decade raising awareness about domestic abuse, said that she has forgiven her ex-husband for his actions.

‘I had to a long time ago, in order for myself to be able to move on and begin to rebuild a life,’ she said.

Still explained that like other victims of domestic abuse, she had once believed that what was happening to her was her own fault, and that it was in her power to fix the relationship.

Her son Dazmann, who has a young child of his own now, said that he would be interested to sit down and talk to his father in order to understand him better – and avoid repeating his mistakes.

‘Not that I'm saying that what he did was OK or anything,’ he said. ‘Or necessarily that I've even forgiven him.‘

Dashing: Susan Still was 18 years old when she met Ulner, then a 26-year-old bass guitar player 

Fairy tale romance: The two got married after several years of dating and soon started a family

Susan Still, who has become a women’s rights activist, has admitted that she is apprehensive about the prospect of her ex-husband being released from prison. 

As an 18-year-old college freshman, Susan was swept off her feet by Ulner Lee Still, a handsome 26-year-old bass guitarist in a local band.

The two started dating and eventually got married and built a family.

From the very beginning, Ulner was controlling, cutting Susan off from her family, banning her from inviting friends over and keeping tabs on her comings and goings at all times. 

But the rocky relationship took a turn for the worse a decade later when Ulner lost his job and Susan, an insurance company employee, became the sole breadwinner, leaving her husband feeling inadequate.

The first time Ulner struck Susan was on the day she forgot to bring him something he had asked from the grocery store.

'He hurt me badly. I just couldn't believe it. It's like you're almost outside your body watching and saying, "This can't be happening,"' she told 20/20 in 2006. 

After the videotaped beating in June 2003, Susan decided to escape with her three children. 

She contacted the Amherst police department and fled to a shelter for abused women. Her sons remained by her side, but her oldest daughter returned to Ulner Still. 

During his trial, the video recording of Susan's assault, along with testimony from the woman's boss and her two sons, helped the prosecution secure a conviction.
