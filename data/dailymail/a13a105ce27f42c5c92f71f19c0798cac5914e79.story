Carl Froch has claimed George Groves rejected a seven-figure payday to hold a rematch of the slugfest that ended so controversially last year - but prospects of a second bout appear good after the IBF ordered a rematch, to be fought within 90 days.

Promoter Eddie Hearn revealed to Sportsmail this week that he hopes to stage the rematch in a stadium on either May 24 or May 31, but Froch revealed negotiations have hit a stumbling block.

Sportsmail understands Groves earned in the region of £500,000 for their first compelling fight, which super-middleweight world champion Froch won via a controversial ninth-round stoppage on November 23.

Read why Carl Froch's boxing promoter Eddie Hearn believes a rematch between the Cobra and George Groves MUST happen this year in his new fortnightly exclusive column.

But an offer to double his money has 
apparently been rejected by Groves, with Froch narrowing his future 
options to either a Groves rematch or a bout in Las Vegas against Julio 
Cesar Chavez Jnr.

Froch 
said: ‘There has been plenty of speculation over the last few weeks 
regarding my future. As it stands we are looking closely at two options 
George Groves and Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr.

‘Yesterday
 (Thursday), we made a seven-figure offer to George Groves for a second 
fight that would have seen him earn around double that of the first.

‘Disappointingly, George rejected this offer so we are continuing our talks with Top Rank and HBO regarding Chavez Jnr.

‘I
 understand the demand for the Groves fight in the UK, but also the 
demand in the US for the Chavez fight. Talks are on-going and no doubt 
some further news will break soon. I’m happy to fight anyone, as I have 
done throughout my entire career.’

Groves
 has repeatedly called out IBF and WBA champion Froch for a rematch of a
 fight he was winning before the referee, Howard Foster, intervened.

Groves on Friday issued a statement of his own to challenge Froch's 
version of events and the IBF later ordered an 
immediate rematch.

He said: 'I am unsure why Carl Froch has released a
 statement implying I do not wish to take the fight, as I was under the 
impression we are still in negotiations. The Matchroom offer in question
 came with many stipulations and options I felt were unsatisfactory.

'I
 am currently awaiting an improved offer from his promoter, as well as 
speaking to other promoters interested in promoting this fight.'

Groves
 added: 'If I didn’t want to fight Carl Froch then I wouldn’t have 
invested so much time and money into appealing with the IBF over the 
dubious outcome of the first fight. I await the outcome of that hearing 
in the very near future.'

Hearn
 revealed to Sportsmail that other fights under consideration for Froch 
are a rematch against Andre Ward, who beat him in 2011, and Gennady 
Golovkin, the middleweight world champion.

Writing
 on Twitter, Hearn said on Friday: 'IBF call for rematch for Froch v 
Groves. Doesn't change much re CF's options but still hopeful of 
agreeing terms with GG.'

The IBF, meanwhile, said: 'After a fight our rules say a boxer has 10 days to file an appeal. Groves did that, and at a hearing on January 15 in Newark we had a three-man panel review all of the evidence and they came back with the decision we must order a rematch.

'The 90 day period starts from Friday, January 24 and I'm pretty sure Carl Froch will have already received notification.

'If he fails to defend the belt against Groves within this period it's more than likely he will lose his title. The fighters and their teams have a certain amount of time to come to an agreement and if they can't, it will come down to purse bids.

'If for some reason Froch gave up the title then we would order the two highest-rated guys to fight for the vacant belt. Since we already ordered Groves to fight Froch, he would be likely to be one of the guys to fight for that vacant title.'

In that event, Groves would likely face the IBF's No 3 Brandon Gonzales.
