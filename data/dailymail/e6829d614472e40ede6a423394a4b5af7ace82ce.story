Spanish businessman Javier Rigau today insisted his marriage to Hollywood legend Gina Lollobrigida is legitimate.

Mr Rigau, 51, put out a statement through his lawyer denying the actress's claims he duped her into marrying him.

Ms Lollobrigida, 85, told police she 
found out on the internet she had been unwittingly wed to Mr Rigau since
2010, and is demanding the marriage be annulled.

The actress, once described as 'the 
most beautiful woman in the world', said she was determined to get to 
the bottom of 'this squalid little affair'.

But Mr Rigau's lawyer Teresa Bueyes said it was 'impossible' the actress did not realise she was married to the Spaniard.

Ms Bueyes said Ms Lollobrigida had 
travelled to Barcelona in August 2010 to sign a legal document agreeing 
to marry Mr Rigau, 34 years her junior, by proxy.

It was signed in front
of a notary, she said.

The former actress has known Spanish businessman Javier Ragau y Rafols for more than 20 years but the pair reportedly split in 2006

The former screen idol starred alongside Humphrey Bogart and Frank Sinatra in the 1950s and 60s

The lawyer said the marriage, celebrated without the actress present on November 29, 2010, was 'completely legitimate'.

She added: 'The marriage between 
Javier Rigau and Gina Lollobrigida satisfied all legal requirements and 
took place with the full knowledge of both participants, as well as 
their legal representatives.'

She and entrepreneur Mr Rigau met at a party in Monte Carlo in 1984 and were 
planning to marry in 2006.

But he pulled out at the last minute, claiming
he could not handle the media spotlight.

The actress, who lives in Rome, now claims he duped her into signing a document in Spanish agreeing to marry.

She told Italian paper La Repubblica :
'A few days ago I discovered by chance on the internet that Javier had 
used a legal document that I had signed for a civil case to hold the 
marriage in my absence and without my knowledge.'

She accused him of 
trying to get his hands on her £35million estate.

His lawyer said Mr Rigau, who lives in
a large mansion in Barcelona and is estimated to be worth £17million, denied that claim.

Ms Lollobrigida was one of the sex 
symbols of her day with sultry starring roles alongside Frank Sinatra 
and Humphrey Bogart during the 1950s and 60s.

The former screen idol has since turned her skills towards art in recent years, first in photography and later sculpting.

Lollobrigida
began making movies in Italy just after the end of World War II.

Her 
screen credits include 'The World's Most Beautiful Woman,' 'Come 
September,' 'Trapeze,' 'Bread, Love and Dreams' and 'Never So Few'.
