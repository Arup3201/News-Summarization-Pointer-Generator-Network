A 32-year-old Canadian woman died as she drank tea at a Peru shaman ceremony. 

Jennifer Logan of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan was backpacking through the country when she had a fatal medical reaction as she drank tea designed to make people vomit, purge and cleanse the body at a rainforest retreat on January 17.

She had to be taken by motorcycle and then boat to the nearest hospital, but she could not be revived by doctors, who say the woman died of a pulmonary edema.

Amy Logan, the victim's youngest sister who recently traveled to Peru with her mother to retrieve her sister's remains, told CBC; 'We suspect the tea had a role.'

Officers have examined the cup Ms. Logan drank out of and the jug while also conducting interviews with staff  as they investigate the death.

Ms. Logan's sister explained that the participants at the two week long all-female retreat at the Canto Luz Centre outside Puerto Maldonado were each given tea to drink, prepared by the staff, and that her sister was attempting to find 'clarity on her future path.'

Ms. Logan, just 32-years-old when she died, had already accomplished much in her life, from tutoring sex-trafficked women and girls in Nepal and working on educational programs in India to, most recently, teaching women in Saudi Arabia to read.

'The other three women in the group stopped vomiting within 15 minutes,' said Ms. Logan's sister.

'Jennifer didn't stop and began to panic.'

Soon after she passed out, and when the staff was unsuccessful administering first aid, they took her to the nearest hospital.

Staff from the retreat claim Ms. Logan was drinking a tobacco purge tea at the time of her death, not the hallucinogenic ayahuasca that has become popular of recent and resulted in several deaths, and describe her death as 'extreme and unusual.'

They also said in a statement that they were 'devastated by this reminder of the power of nature, both for life and death, and the absoluteness of life deep in the Amazon rainforest.'

They have temproarily closed as Ms. Logan's death is investigated.
