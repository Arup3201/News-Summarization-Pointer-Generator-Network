With many of us saving up to bag a seat on a budget airline for our week in the sun, it may come as a surprise that Europeans are no strangers to the pleasure of a private jet.

A brand new infogpraphic based on Private Jet Charter's client base and research shows which continents are flying the most private jets - and European's come out on top, followed by North America, the Middle East and Russia.

South America was the continent least likely to travel this way.

While business being the reason for 62 per cent of travel by jet, 38 per cent of passengers are lucky enough to be flying for leisure.

The 16-seater Gulfstream G550, which can fly up to 575mph is the most frequently chartered private jet, and the Embraer Legacy 600/650 which has speeds up to 518mph was also popular.

The study also looked at up and coming markets to look into for gaining clients, and found Asian clients were increasingly travelling by private jet.
