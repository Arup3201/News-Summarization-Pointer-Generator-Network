A two-year-old British boy has drowned in a swimming pool on holiday with his family in Tunisia.

Loui Aspinall, of Wigan, Greater Manchester, died after getting into difficulties when he went into the water after eating lunch at the Houda Golf and Beach Resort in Skanes, near Monastir.

But the news of his death last month on September 25 has only been revealed after holidaymakers began giving details of the tragedy in reviews of the all-inclusive hotel on the TripAdvisor website.

Tragic: One witness claimed a lifeguard pulled the boy from the water at the pool and tried to revive him

British police said they wanted to speak to the tourists who posted the reviews online, with one witness claiming a lifeguard pulled the boy from the water and unsuccessfully tried to revive him.

An inquest has been opened and adjourned into Loui's death in Wigan, and officers now hope the holidaymakers will give statements on what happened for a full inquest expected next year.

One reviewer speculated that ‘nobody appeared to be trained in basic CPR’ and the lifeguards had been chatting to young girls, while another claimed the pools were ‘dangerously’ overcrowded.

But a third holidaymaker said: ‘This was not the hotel’s fault and the lifeguards were definitely not chatting away to girls. As previous reviews have said it cannot be blamed on the hotel or the staff.

‘It is such a tragic accident but accidents can happen anywhere to anybody and it is not something that a hotel or staff can be held responsible for.

‘The lifeguards brought the little boy back to life, so if anything they should be praised not slagged off.’

A fourth holidaymaker said: ‘No one is to blame. The lifeguard did an amazing job, he remained calm and did exactly the correct procedure for an infant who had drowned - even though he was surrounded by people shouting and screaming at him.'

Greater Manchester Police Coroner’s Officer Paul Devine said: ‘Our thoughts are with his family at this heartbreaking time.

Holidaymaker's review on TripAdvisor

‘While the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been offering support to the family, we have been asked by the coroner to appeal to anyone who may have seen this tragedy or its aftermath.

‘This is not a criminal investigation and there are no suspicious circumstances, however the family supports this request as this will help the coroner best decide the tragic circumstances that lead to the boy's death.

‘We know that there has been talk of what happened on social media and are trying to speak to anyone who claims to be a witness, but there could be several British tourists who do not know that this inquest will take place.’

A spokesman for the Houda resort did not immediately return a request for comment by MailOnline.
