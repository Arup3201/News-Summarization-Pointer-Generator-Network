It's a debate that has raged across homes and offices for  years: Should you put milk in before you make a cup of tea, or afterwards?

Now, this argument may have finally been settled as the British Standards Institution's (BSI) official guidelines claim the milk should be put in the cup first - at least when a pot is being brewed.

It also explained that to gain the institution's approval, the pot must be made of porcelain, there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml and the water must not exceed 85°C (185°F) when served.

According to the official best practice guide by London-based British Standards Institution there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml of water used, and the water must not exceed 85°C (185°F) when served with milk. At least 2.5ml of milk should be added to a small bowl or cup before the infused water is added

The BSI is the business standards company best known for the BSI Kitemark. 

This mark is an internationally recognised symbol of excellence and is seen on everything from manholes to aircraft.

Formed in 1901, BSI was the world’s first National Standards Body and in addition to the Kitemark, it also tests products to make sure they meet certain standards, such as rugby scrum caps, fire extinguishers and condoms, as well as issuing standards which act as guidance for companies looking to implement best practice. 

The institution's best practice when it comes to making a cup of tea is called 'Preparation of a liquor of tea for use in sensory tests.'

Herbal teas (stock image) should be steeped in water with a temperature of 95°C (203°F)

Steeping tea is the process of soaking a solid - in this case tea leaves - to extract flavours and soften it. 

For standard black tea, freshly boiled water should be used - with temperatures above 95°C (203°F).  

Water should be left to cool down for at least 30 seconds when making green and white tea, with a recommended temperature of 74°C to 85°C (160°F to 203°F). 

Oolong tea is best steeped in 85°C (185°F) water. 

Herbal teas should be steeped in water with a temperature of 95°C (203°F). 

Regardless of the temperature, the standard explained that tea should be steeped for six minutes.

According to this standard, two different sized pots made of porcelain or glazed earthenware are recommended, alongside two corresponding small and large 'bowls' - or cups. 

The first, large pot should measure be between 74mm and 78mm wide and stand between 83mm and 87mm tall. It should also have a lid.

The ideal smaller pot should be between 61mm and 65 mm tall and ideally 64mm wide.

The larger cup is should be between 57mm and 63mm tall by 109mm - plus or minus 3mm -compared to 49mm and 55mm wide.

Either way, the large pot should not exceed 318ml, and the small pot must have a maximum capacity of 159ml. 

To make tea without milk, 2g of tea should be used for every 100ml of water.

Pour freshly boiled water into the pot up to 4mm and 6mm below the brim. 

The tea should then be left to infuse for six minutes.

This is also known as steeping and is the process of soaking a solid - in this case tea leaves - to extract flavours. 

On average, a teabag weighs 2g but contains around 1.5g of tea leaves, so at least two bags should be used for a small pot of tea and at least four should be used for a larger pot. 

When made with milk, the tea should be made and brewed in the same way and then added to milk in the cup.

At least 2.5ml milk is recommended for use with a smaller pot, and 5ml milk is advised for the larger pot. 

This helps the milk mix more evenly though the 'liquor' when the tea is added to the bowl.  

To make sure the water doesn't scald the milk, the BSI explained that its temperature should not exceed 85°C (185°F), but should be above 60°C (140°F) for optimum flavour and sensation.

The standard does explain that different sized pots can be used, but these measurements are recommended.

If milk is added first and the teabag is dropped into the milk before it has infused with the water, then the steeping process is affected. 

It doesn't affect the brewing process, but it will cool down the liquid which will directly impact the effectiveness of the steeping.

Dr. Stanley Segall at Drexel University, Philadelphia said: 'When you steep tea leaves in hot water, water-soluble materials are extracted to produce the tea.

'Changes in brewing temperature affect extraction of colour- and flavour-responsible chemicals exponentially.'

He explained that reaction rates generally double for every rise in temperature of 18°F, and decrease by the same factor when the temperature is lowered.
