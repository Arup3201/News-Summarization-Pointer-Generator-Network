Carolina Panthers coach Ron Rivera and his family have escaped uninjured after a fire ripped through their 7,000-square-foot home in in Charlotte, North Carolina, early Monday.

It took roughly 55 firefighters around an hour to extinguish the blaze, with early indicators suggesting it was accidental.

The house - situated on the luxury Heydon Hall Circle where properties run upwards of $1million - is now inhabitable due to significant smoke and water damage. It's not yet known how much restoration will cost.

According to WSOC-TV, there were six people in the building when the fire started: Rivera, his wife Stephanie, his two brothers and their wives.

Rivera's son and daughter were not home at the time. 

Charlotte Fire Department, Captain Rob Brisley, said that his staff were able to keep flames contained to the roof and attic area, meaning a lot of  household items were saved. 

He added: 'Anytime you are faced with a fire and your family is displaced it is significant for the homeowner and it is significant for the family. We are just grateful that there are no injuries.'

Brisley said the fire started around 4am at the large two-story house. He said the alarm system worked properly, alerting the family to leave and the fire department. 

Fire officials reported seeing heavy smoke and fire coming from the house when they arrived. 

Television footage also shows blackened windows in the attic of the home.

The family will not be able to live at the house until necessary repairs are conducted.  

'When you at a fire like this, it is never easy to deal with a family that is being devastated,' Brisley said. 

'But you can tell they have good support at all levels. It's a busy week for the city of Charlotte including this family.'

According to property records, Rivera purchased the abode in April 2011, a few months after he became the Panthers' head coach.

Rivera's Panthers will play Saturday in an NFC divisional playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks. 

The fire comes two days after the Panthers beat the Arizona Cardinals 27-16 in an NFC wild-card game, Rivera's first postseason win in his four seasons in Carolina.

The Panthers were not scheduled to practice Monday. 

However, Rivera is likely to address the media Monday afternoon as normally scheduled, according to team spokesman Charlie Dayton.    

This is the second significant off-the-field problem to hit the Panthers in less than a month.

Quarterback Cam Newton was injured in a two-vehicle accident on December 9 and was hospitalized overnight with two fractures in his lower back. Newton missed one game but was able to return the following week.
