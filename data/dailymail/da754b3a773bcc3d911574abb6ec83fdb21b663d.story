The winter fuel allowance and free bus passes are only protected until 2015, David Cameron said today as he promised future rises in the state pension.

Mr Cameron appeared to leave the door open for cuts to pensioner benefits after the next election, insisting his priority was to guarantee rises in income for people who have retired.

The Prime Minister has come under increasing pressure to ditch his promise to protect welfare handouts for wealthy over-65s at a time when the benefits bill is continuing to rise.

Mr Cameron today insisted the pledge 
made in the run-up to the 2010 general election not to cut the winter 
fuel allowance, free bus passes and free TV licences for the over-75s 
would be honoured for this parliament.

But pressed on whether he 
would protect them after 2015, he told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘We will
 set out our plans in our manifesto.’

Labour and the Lib Dems have already said the pensioner benefits should not be off limits from future welfare cuts.

Mr
 Cameron made clear that he wants to ensure the state pension continues 
to rise, pledging that all pensioners will get a bumper £1,000-a-year 
rise if the Tories win the election.

The Prime Minister said he would
 guarantee that Britain’s 12 million elderly get a minimum extra 2.5 per
 cent every year on their state pension from 2015 to 2020 – and more if 
prices or wages rise faster.

The offer, which equates to an increase 
of around £20 a week on the basic state pension, will add about 
£12  billion a year to the pensions bill. It means that by 2020, the 
state pension could rise to £160 a week. The move is an attempt to win 
the crucial ‘grey vote’.

An estimated one in three people who vote in elections are over the official retirement age, both due to longer life expectancy and a significantly higher turnout rate compared with the under-40s.

The new package comes after the Prime Minister vowed to maintain the so-called ‘triple lock’ on pension rises. Introduced in 2010, it ensures that the state pension rises each year in line with whichever is highest among average wages, inflation, or 2.5 per cent.

It means that though wages rose by only 0.7 per cent last year, the state pension will go up in April by 2.7 per cent – in line with prices.

It will take the basic pension, before contribution-related elements, to £113.10 a week.

Experts say that keeping the ‘triple 
lock’ in place until the end of the next Parliament will be worth a bare
 minimum of £900 a year to pensioners compared with their current income
 - and potentially much more if wages or inflation race ahead.

Mr
 Cameron has already vowed to introduce a flat-rate pension of £144 a 
week in 2016. If it rises by 2.5 per cent a year from then until 2020, 
the weekly pension could be up to £160.

Campaigners were quick to point out last night that much of the increase will be swallowed up by rising bills for energy, food and other essential items.

Mr Cameron said: ‘I am determined to give people who have worked hard and done the right thing security and peace of mind in retirement.

'We are only able do this because we are taking the difficult decisions to tackle the deficit and put our economy back on the right path.’

The basic state pension now represents a higher share of average earnings than at any time over the past 20 years.
