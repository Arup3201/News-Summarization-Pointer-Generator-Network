Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Burnley lost their only previous opening weekend fixture in the Barclays Premier League (0-2 to Stoke in Aug 2009).

Jose Mourinho has seen Chelsea win on all five opening weekends that he has been manager.

In fact, the Blues are unbeaten since 1998/99 on the opening day, winning 13 of 15 games (D2).

Burnley lost both games against Chelsea during their only previous Premier League season (2009/10).

Head boy: John Terry pounced to head home eight minutes from time at Turf Moor when Chelsea last met Burnley in January 2010, a game the Blues would win 2-1

Chelsea have won more points than any other team on the opening weekend of Premier League seasons (47).

Cesc Fabregas has scored in each of his two Premier League appearances against Burnley.

Chelsea allowed the joint-fewest shots on target against them in 2013-14 (122; along with Man City).

Burnley allowed fewer shots on target against them than any other team in the Championship last season (159).

Chelsea have conceded just 10 goals in their last 23 Premier League matches.

Only Sunderland’s Vito Mannone (77.4 per cent) had a better save percentage than Petr Cech (76.9 per cent) in the 2013-14 Premier League.
