It’s a common problem: You sit down for dinner and your jeans fit perfectly, but the more you eat the tighter they get.

At the moment you have to manually undo the zip to feel comfortable, but in the future your zip may be able to adjust automatically.

A researcher from MIT has created the Zipperbot that uses sensors to open and close the teeth in response to movement - such as an expanding waistline.

The Zipperbot was designed by MIT researcher Adam Whiton as part of his Sartorial Robotics thesis. In a video, the robotic zipper is shown moving autonomously across a zip placed on a flat surface as well as on material wrapped around an arm (pictured)

In a video, the zipper is shown moving across a zip placed on a flat surface as well as on material wrapped around an arm.

Zipperbot uses optical sensors to accurately line-up the teeth so the zip doesn’t become jammed or snag on the surrounding material.

It additionally uses motion sensors to detect movement. During a demonstration, Mr Whiton added the zipperbot to a skirt which released and tightened in relation to the wearer’s movements.

The leather XOO Belt looks like a normal belt, but has a charger built into the buckle. 

It is held in place using magnets so it can be easily connected and disconnected.  

The belt, which comes in black and brown, can be charged up like an ordinary smartphone via a USB cable and has enough power to charge an iPhone 6 from scratch or 'pretty much any device' in around three hours.

The cable is concealed behind the leather part of the belt, which contains a flexible battery.

And in theory, this means it could be used to loosen or tighten after a meal, or between standing up and sitting down.

Other uses include helping children or people with disabilities dress themselves, or self-closing zips on biohazard suits, for example.  

Mr Whiton said: ‘Zipperbot, a robotic continuous closure for fabric edge joining, was developed to explore autonomous control of a sartorial gesture and performed as a wearable robot which was evaluated through social interactions.

‘Clothing is a uniquely human pursuit and is nearly universal in its adoption and use.

‘It plays a prominent role in our individual cultures transmitting a mixture of social signals and meanings through the semiotics of fashion.

‘Merging robotics and fashion within the practice of Sartorial Robotics will enhance the explorations of identities for both humans and robots. 

At this year's Consumer Electronics Show, a French firm demonstrated its self-adjusting belt called Belty. 

The smart prototype syncs wirelessly to an app to track steps, loosen and tighten as wearer's move, and even warns them when they're being lazy.

The metal and plastic model was created by Paris-based designers Bertrand Dupla and Carine Coulm at Emiota. 

If the waistline begins to expand, the belt warns the user via this app that they're putting on weight.

When sitting down, the belt expands to give the wearer more breathing space, and it automatically tightens when the wearer stands up again. 

It does this by tracking tension on sensors fitted throughout the belt.

The app can additionally be used to set maximum and minimum fittings for the belt (pictured), meaning it doesn’t become too tight, or too loose, when automatically adjusting

Belty will also warn wearers if they’ve been sat still for too long, giving them a nudge to get up and walk around.

Plus, if the wearer leaves their fitness tracker at home, the belt includes an accelerometer and gyroscope to record steps and exercise levels, which also syncs with the app.

The product is still under development but Mr Dupla said he hopes to have Belty on the market by the end of the year, with prices yet to be announced.
