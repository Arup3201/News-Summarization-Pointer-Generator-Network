A problem that couldn't be solved with a bucket, a printer or even a trusty cardboard box led two US college students to create The Foot Hammock, a comfortable under-the-desk cradle for your feet.  

Matt Hulme and his housemate Brent Murray, both 21, launch a Kickstarter fundraising campaign on January 6 to raise $100,000, their first target, to launch full-scale production of their product.

The Foot Hammock attaches to the underside of any desk, the place the designers argue we spend more time at than we sleep. Matt says we spend at least six hours a day at a desk, and gamers such as he and Brent can add an average of seven hours a week.

'I tried a bunch of different solutions,' says Matt, who studies at Brigham Young University in Utah. 

'I tried a cardboard box, that wasn't very comfortable. I tried my printer, and ended up breaking that.'

He also tried a bucket under the desk to rest his feet on, pushing his feet against the wall and sitting on them - but none of those instinctive solutions cut it.

So after testing 50 fabrics and 20 methods to attach the hammock to the desk, they came up with the final product.

The hammock also comes in a mesh version intended for using while wearing shoes

It's 'easy to take up and down' and 'totally adjustable', says Brent, who goes to Salt Lake Community College.

There's a mesh version for shoes on, a fleece one intended to make bare feet feel snug and a heated version, just like a mini electric blanket for your feet.

While there's not mention of the egonomics involved in their means of sitting, but they do say it's 'The most comfortable way to sit at your desk.'
