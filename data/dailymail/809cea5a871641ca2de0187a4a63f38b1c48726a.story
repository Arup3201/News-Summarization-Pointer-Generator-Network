Chelsea will face Paris Saint-Germain in the knockout stages of the Champions League for the second consecutive season after the two teams were paired together in Monday's draw.

Both clubs eased through the group stage and into the 16, but how do they match-up ahead of next year's two-legged tie?

Will Chelsea be happy with the draw?

Yes. Jose Mourinho had hoped to face the Ligue 1 champions due to the short and simple journey across the Channel.

The Blues could have faced easier opposition in Basle, Bayer Leverkusen or Shakhtar Donetsk, but they will know what to expect after knocking Laurent Blanc's side out at the quarter-final stage last season.

They also avoided Italian champions Juventus, which can't be a bad thing.

Will PSG be happy with the draw?

Not particularly. They could've drawn Porto, Borussia Dortmund or Atletico Madrid so to get Premier League leaders Chelsea is a bit of a blow.

But having said that, they did avoid favourites Bayern Munich and Real Madrid.

Have the two teams met before?

Yes. Chelsea recovered from a 3-1 defeat against PSG in the first leg of their quarter-final last season to dump Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Co out on the away goals rule.

A 2-0 victory at Stamford Bridge was enough for Mourinho's men, with Demba Ba scoring late on to make himself a hero.

Prior to last season's meeting, the two clubs last met in the 2004-05 group stage.

Chelsea earned a convincing win at the Parc des Princes in September 2004 as a double from Didier Drogba and another from John Terry sealed a 3-0 victory.

But they couldn't repeat the feat on home soil as PSG fought for a 0-0 draw.

Who do Chelsea have to watch out for?

Key man: Zlatan Ibrahimovic

A star under Mourinho at Inter Milan, Ibrahimovic will be looking to get one over his former manager after Chelsea's triumph earlier this year.

The Swede has two goals in three games in this season's Champions League and he has hit eight in 10 in Ligue 1, too.

If fit, he will lead the line for PSG and could prove a thorn in the side of Terry and Co.

Elsewhere, Brazil defender David Luiz has something to prove to Mourinho after being allowed to leave Stamford Bridge in a £50million deal last summer.

And Edinson Cavani, with five Champions League goals in six appearances this season, will be looking to continue his fine form in Europe.

And what about the managers?

This tie will provide the third and fourth meetings between Mourinho and Blanc, with both having one win to their name so far.

They didn't see eye-to-eye when Chelsea and PSG met back in April, with the Portuguese suggesting that winning the title in France was easy.

Blanc hit back: 'Maybe if we're talking about the league and I'm sure that Jose Mourinho knows the French league very well. There are two really big clubs in Ligue 1 (PSG and Monaco), but if I remember correctly, I think it was the same for him in Spain, with Barcelona and Madrid.'

Laurent Blanc has not always got along with Mourinho, who he will come up against twice next year

What kind of draw is it for the fans?

An affordable one. Supporters can get to France by plane, train and ferry, giving them plenty of options to follow their team abroad.

They could also choose to drive direct to Paris from London in about five-and-a-half hours.

What has it done for Chelsea's chances of winning the Champions League?

Lessened them according to the bookmakers. Chelsea are now 7-1 to lift the trophy in Berlin next May, out from 11-2 before the draw was made in Nyon.
