Most of the Tory high command would like to see Nadine Dorries skinned alive for her temerity in abandoning Parliament for the thrills of reality TV.

So, no doubt many will have been delighted  last night at the look of horror across her face as she discovered what she had let herself in for on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!

The Conservative MP appeared shocked on finding out that contestants would be forced to empty their own toilet in the Australian jungle. Reading camp instructions she said: 'Oh my God! We have to empty the toilet out with our hands.'

Mrs Dorries, 55, also seemed upset that the contestants would be sleeping on the ground instead of hammocks, distilling their own water and collecting firewood.

The former nurse took charge of the camp and later said she was 'worn out' after delegating tasks to her team mates. Viewers saw Mrs Dorries justify her appearance in the jungle to fellow camper Hugo Taylor from TV show Made in Chelsea.

She said: 'Sixteen million people watching this show. That's how politics should be. Sixteen million people do not watch Prime Minister's Question Time or Question Time.'

Her publicity point was rammed home when former Coronation Street star Helen Flanagan wasted no time stripping to her bikini to get in the camp shower – a scene that has become customary among the fame-hungry in the TV jungle.

Back with Mrs Dorries, Mr Taylor asked the politician if she would ever like to be Prime Minister.'God no,' she said. 'Never in a million years.'

Later she asked former darts champion Eric Bristow how he had voted in the last election. He responded: 'I don't vote. They're all liars.' Yesterday a blog that Mrs Dorries wrote before going into the jungle revealed she fully knew her appearance on the show was likely to cause trouble.

Published yesterday, it began with the words: 'G'day. Is it outrage back home?' She then added: 'I think many may have guessed that I am a bit of an anti-politics politician.'

The Mid-Bedfordshire MP caused fury last week when she left for the ITV1 show without telling her local association or getting permission from the Chief Whip. She has since been suspended from the party.

However, Mrs Dorries remains defiant, claiming that she had informed the Whips Office that she would be away for a month. She also said she will be donating her parliamentary salary for the period she is away to children's charities.

If she is away for a month that would be around £5,500 which is significantly less than the £40,000 fee she is understood to be receiving from ITV to be a contestant.

It was claimed yesterday that divorced Mrs Dorries is in a relationship with Jockey Club vet Chris Hammond who has apparently travelled to Queensland to be with her.

He could not be contacted yesterday and an agent hired by Mrs Dorries refused to confirm the identity of her partner.
