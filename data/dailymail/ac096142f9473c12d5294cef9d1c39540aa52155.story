Two British girl are preparing to take on the world at the Miss American Dream beauty competition in the Bahamas later this month.

Liverpudlian Aimee Ormesher, 21, has already taken the Miss American Dream UK title - but now hopes to bring home the international prize.

Fellow competitor, Louise Glover, 29, is the winner of the Miss American Dream Europe prize.

Blonde ambition: Aimee Ormesher hopes that success will help her become a professional model at home

Beauty: Aimee has already triumphed in the Miss American Dream UK competition

Jetset: Aimee and fellow entrant, Louise Glover, will fly to the Bahamas for the competition

Amy, who works as a payroll assistant in
her native Liverpool, hopes that success in the Caribbean will lead to 
work as a professional model back in the UK.

Despite the bad press beauty pageants sometimes receive on this side of the Atlantic, Amy believes that taking part in a pageant can help boost girls' self esteem.

She said: 'I wasn’t confident on the night [I won the UK title], I was just thinking about this dance I had to do with the other contestants.

'I wanted to use the pageant as a platform to get into the modelling industry.'I would love to do it full time. I’ll just have to see how it goes and hopefully I’ll get lucky and win at the Miss American Dream world finals.'

Amy has spent the last four years pursuing her dream of becoming a professional model and in 2008, came runner up in a competition run by local paper, the Liverpool Echo.

Glamorous: Fellow Liverpudlian, Louise Glover, 29, will also compete in the pageant

Healthy: Former glamour girl, Louise, survived a heart attack and has begun a new career as a fitness model

Tropical paradise: The competition will take place in the beautiful Caribbean nation of the Bahamas

She added: 'I’m so excited. I’m training with a personal trainer at the minute to make sure I’m fit enough when I get there.

'I’m so made up to be in the world finals. I’m just sorting out all the clothes I need to take for the contest.'

Unlike Aimee, Louise Glover has already had a career as a glamour model but swapped topless shoots for fitness after a heart attack made her reassess her life.

Louise, who suffered from depression and gained a stone in weight during her recovery said:

'I’ve had an absolute nightmare going through it all. I almost died and it really made me think about what I want to do with my life.'

Louise, whose chequered past includes a conviction for benefit fraud six years ago, the result, she says of growing up with drug addict parents, added:

'I only entered the competition to build my confidence back, I really didn’t expect to win it. I’m over the moon with excitement. Throughout my life, I’ve had to learn to deal with knock backs – it has been a huge part of the industry I’ve been in.

'But I genuinely believe that everything I have experienced, both positive and negative, has put me in the direction I’m going and I now understand that everything happens for a reason!

'I’m really looking forward to the new challenges ahead.'
