Getting a mobile signal can be an uphill battle - something these villagers know better than anyone.

The isolated residents in eastern Turkey have no choice but to climb half a mile to a remote water tower when they want to call their loved ones.

Several villages are thought to have the same problem in the Başkale district, near the Iranian border - and the residents say they are fed up.

I found signal! It's hard for these residents of the remote eastern Turkish district of Baskale to have a phone call in private - as they all have to troop half a mile up a hill together to get signal on their mobiles

'Hello? I'm on a mountain!' The region is isolated near the Iranian border and can be cut off in the winter snow

The 70-mile journey along a remote 
mountain highway to the nearest city, Van, means they are worried they 
will be isolated if something disastrous happens.

With heavy snow in the winter and droughts in the summer, some families say they have now taken the decision to move away.

Turkey's
 mobile phone operators are in talks with the villages about setting up a
 better service for them.

But for now, a daily hike is the only way for 
these men to talk to those they hold dearest.

Photographer Özkan Bilgin, who works in the city of Van, captured the unusual ritual on camera.

Solution: The villagers are in talks with Turkey's mobile operators to try and get more reliable coverage

Difficulty: The villagers' predicament was captured by photographer Özkan Bilgin, who works in the city of Van

He
 told MailOnline: 'When there is snow, rain and storms they cannot leave
 for the outside world... In emergency situations the health care team 
do not reach the villagers.

'Despite
 all the difficulties they continue with their lives, but because of the
 hardships some have resorted to migrating to the city or to other 
regions.

'Around 15 out of 50 households have migrated because of the difficulties.'
