Luis Suarez has been banned for ten matches after the Uruguayan bit an opponent in front of millions of television viewers around the world.

The striker, 26, sank his teeth into the arm of Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic during their 2-2 draw on Sunday.

The FA Football Assocation then charged him with violent conduct and this afternoon imposed one of the longest bans in the history of English football.

A three-man panel deemed the offence more serious than the eight-game ban he received for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra last season.

Bite: Liverpool striker Luis Suarez, 26, sank his teeth into the arm of Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic during the clubs' 2-2 draw and was banned for ten games today

Apology: Liverpool striker Suarez said on his official Twitter account that he was 'so sorry' for what happened

Suarez has been
in trouble for biting players before, having earned the nickname 'The Cannibal of 
Ajax' and a seven-match ban in 2010 for drawing blood from the shoulder 
of PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal while playing in Holland.

In trouble: Suarez has been fined by his club and is donating the cash to the Hillsborough fund, but the club are furious at the FA's long ban

Having stood by the player Liverpool have expressed fury at the ruling from Wembley this afternoon.

'Both the club and player shocked and disappointed at the severity of today’s Independent Regulatory Commission decision', the club's managing director Ian Ayre said.

But the FA says it is right they stop Suarez playing in the Premier League until the end of September.

'A three-person Independent Regulatory Commission today upheld The FA’s claim that a suspension of three matches was clearly insufficient and the player will serve a further seven first-team matches in addition to the standard three. The suspension begins with immediate effect', their statement said.

'The Liverpool forward had accepted a charge of violent conduct but had denied The FA’s claim that the standard three-match sanction was insufficient for the offence.

'Suarez has until midday on Friday to appeal the additional suspension, above the standard three matches.'

In 2011 Suarez moved from Holland to Liverpool, and soon afterwards 
the striker was fined £40,000 and banned for eight matches for 
racially abusing Manchester United star Patrice Evra.

Evra retaliated this week by chewing on a fake arm as Manchester United won the Premier League  title.

Suarez was even offered anger management counselling by the body in charge of protecting players.

PFA boss Gordon Taylor said today: 
'There is no doubting his football ability, that's why it is so 
disappointing and embarrassing when he lets himself down.

'We
have to work hard on anger management now. We have trained counsellors 
in this field and we will be offering their services to Liverpool and 
the player to try to improve matters.'

The Uruguayan has been fined by Liverpool for his latest misdemeanour.

It
has not been disclosed how much Suarez has been fined – it could range 
between two to four weeks’ wages, which would equate to a figure between
£200,000 to £400,000 – but he asked for the money to go to the 
Hillsborough Family Support Group.

Attack: Suarez was seen running into the box before losing the ball and biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic

Aftermath: Ivanovic was shown screaming and then showed the bitemarks on his arm to the referee, who failed to take any action

When
asked during an interview with the club’s in-house television station, 
LFC TV, whether events of the last 24 hours would have a bearing on 
Suarez’s future, Ayre replied: ‘Not at all. It affects his future in the
sense that we have to work with him on his discipline.

‘But
Luis is a very important player to the club. He’s a very popular player
with his teammates. As we keep saying, he signed a new four-year 
contract last summer and we’d all love to see him here throughout that 
contract.

After the match Suarez tweeted: 'I'm sad for what happened this 
afternoon, I apologize Ivanovic and all football world for my 
inexcusable behaviour. I'm so sorry about it!!

'I've just spoken to Ivanovic on the phone and I could apologise directly to him. Thanks for accepting.' 

Last summer the striker, who is 
married to childhood sweetheart Sofia Balbi and has a two-year-old 
daughter Delfina, signed a new contract doubling his basic pay to 
£100,000 a week. This season he has scored 22 goals in 32 games.
