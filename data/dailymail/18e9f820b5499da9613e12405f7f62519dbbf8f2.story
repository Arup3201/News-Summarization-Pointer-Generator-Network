Alfreton Town’s chances of progressing to the FA Cup first round already look slim after it was revealed they’ll need to field an outfield player in goal on Tuesday.

The Conference side are struggling in the fifth tier this year, but their trip to Lincoln City for a fourth qualifying round replay just became that bit tougher.

Goalkeeper James Severn ruptured a thigh muscle during the 1-1 draw against the Imps on Saturday and only players who were registered for the initial game are eligible for the clash at Sincil Bank.

The on-loan Scunthorpe man – who continued playing on Saturday despite the injury - was Alfreton’s only fit goalkeeper after Cameron Dawson picked up a thigh injury.

Manager Nicky Law confirmed that the Reds sought special dispensation from the FA to bring a ‘keeper in, but had their request declined.

‘It is an extraordinary set of circumstances,’ he said. ‘We have just 11 fit players, one of whom is going to have to play in goal.

‘We are not complaining, and we have already checked with the FA that we will not be fined for fielding a weakened side.’

The winners travel to Eastleigh in the first round proper.
