Kylie McKechnie with his pet cockerel Fudge who was found dead on Saturday following complaints from neighbours about its crowing

A schoolboy's beloved pet cockerel has been found dead in its pen following a dispute with neighbours over his early morning crowing. 

Kyle McKechnie nursed the bird named Fudge back to health after he found it wandering around injured. The two became so inseparable that the cockerel would watch TV on the 11-year-old's knee.  

Neighbours began complaining when Fudge crowed each morning at 5am when Kyle's courier driver father, Scott, 38, left for work. When he switched on the lights Fudge would cocka-doodle-do thinking that it was sunrise.  

The housing association who own the McKechnie's house in Thetford, Norfolk, told the family that Fudge had to go by January 2 as they were breaking their tenancy agreement. 

The family then set about finding a new home for the cockerel, as the RSPCA warned them they could be prosecuted for releasing Fudge back into the wild.  

But on Saturday, before Kyle had a chance to re-home his pet, he found Fudge dead. He had been set to give the cockerel to a new owner after Christmas. 

Mr McKechnie said someone had cut the chain on Fudge's pen and snapped its neck.

The father-of-three said: 'It can't have been a fox as there was no blood and the other chicken we own was fine.

'The chain on the pen was broken and his neck had clearly been snapped so we think one of the neighbours who complained killed him.' 

The police have been informed, but Mr Scott said they had no evidence to suggest who killed Fudge. 

He added: 'Kyle was really really upset. I have been left with three absolutely devastated children who have been left without their pet just before Christmas. 

'I really hope we find who did it.' 

A Norfolk Constabulary spokeswoman said police had not been able to establish exactly how Fudge had died and had told the McKechnie family to take their pet to find out.

Kylie's father Scott, above, said his son and his two other children had been left 'absolutely devastated' following the death, just days before Christmas

Kylie had found a new home for his pet and was going to give Fudge to a new owner next week

Ms McKechnie said the family couldn't afford to do that, and he believed the cause of death was obvious.   

An RSPCA spokeswoman said: 'We are alarmed and concerned to hear reports that someone may have killed this cockerel because of the noise he made.

'If it is true, this sounds like a completely pointless and callous act. We can only hope that the cockerel was killed by someone experienced in a quick, effective and humane way.'

The RSPCA said anyone with information about the death should contact them.
