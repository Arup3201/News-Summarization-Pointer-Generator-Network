The new Formula One season gets underway in the early hours of Sunday morning when Melbourne plays host to the opening race of the campaign. 

Ahead of the curtain raiser, Phil Duncan assesses the sport's hot topics... 

So, it looks like Lewis Hamilton is going to waltz to back-to-back titles…

There’s no question that Mercedes are set to pick up in 2015 where they left off last year. Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg clocked up more miles than any of their rivals over the winter, and they were the quickest, too. Hamilton won 11 of the 19 races last year, and you fancy if he sorts out his performances in qualifying, he’ll be tough to beat.

Hamilton’s popped up at a host of celeb parties over the winter… Is there any danger he’s taken his eye off the ball?

The reigning champion has helped to raise F1’s profile away from the track after attending a number of showbiz functions during the off-season. From the Paris catwalk to the red carpet at the BRITs, Hamilton's never been far from the limelight. His high-profile split from Nicole Scherzinger has hit the headlines, too. 

But the Briton, now somewhat of the elder statesman on the grid having celebrated his 30th birthday at the turn of the year, appears to have adopted a new-found maturity in recent times, and his desire to match Ayrton Senna’s feat of three world titles appears to be his sole focus heading into the new campaign. At least, he's telling us that anyway.

So, what can Rosberg do to stop him?

Rosberg out-qualified Hamilton 12-7 last term, but his race displays left much to be desired; indeed he converted just three of his 11 poles into victories in 2014. If the German sorts out his race pace, he’ll give Hamilton a run for his money. At 3-1 with some bookmakers, he’s certainly worth a punt.

And what about the rest of the grid?

Williams, powered by Mercedes once more, are set to be Hamilton and Rosberg’s nearest challengers. Valtteri Bottas was one of the stand-out performers last term, and his team-mate Felipe Massa is among the most experienced out there. 

Ferrari, boosted by the arrival of Sebastian Vettel from Red Bull, have seemingly turned a corner in pre-season testing and look primed to bounce back from two years in the doldrums. Daniel Ricciardo, the only non-Mercedes driver to win a race last year, should be confident after a number of impressive displays in 2014, but his Renault-powered Red Bull still lacks what it takes to challenge Hamilton and Rosberg on a consistent basis.

I noticed you haven’t mentioned McLaren… I thought they were going to be back at the front after renewing their partnership with Honda?

Well, that was the plan, but it looks as though it will be some time before either Fernando Alonso or Jenson Button get a sniff of the podium let alone win a race. 

The Woking-based outfit, struck by a host of reliability issues managed fewer miles than any other team in testing and they were well off the pace, too. Button, retained by McLaren after a surprise U-turn from the team's hierarchy at the end of last year, has already called for patience, and reckons just getting to the finish on Sunday, should be considered a positive result.

Jenson Button is set for his 16th season in Formula One, but McLaren are likely to struggle from the offset 

And Alonso, their marque signing, won't be there? 

No. The Spaniard suffered a mysterious crash in testing which left him concussed and in hospital for three days. CCTV captured the 134mph smash, but the footage  has never been released adding to the mystery surrounding the incident. 

The former Ferrari man is confident he will back for the second race in Malaysia, but his participation is yet to be confirmed by McLaren. Kevin Magnussen, dropped by the British team at the end of last year, gets his chance in Melbourne this weekend.

With a combined age of 68, Alonso and Button form the eldest pairing on the grid, but what about this kid Verstappen? He isn’t old enough to drive a road car yet is he?

Not in his native Holland, no. Son of Jos Verstappen, the former Benetton driver and team-mate of Michael Schumacher, Max is just 17. He has been partnered at Red Bull's junior team Toro Rosso with rookie Carlos Sainz Jnr, who at the grand old age of 20 is somewhat of a veteran.

Verstappen will become the youngest driver in F1 history on Sunday, and it’s a record which is unlikely to be broken after the FIA raised the minimum age limit to 18 in the wake of Verstappen’s controversial appointment.

So, what else do I need to look out for this season?

Following one of the grandest overhauls of the sport ahead of the last campaign, the rules and regulations are relatively unchanged for 2015. Ugly nosecones are thankfully a thing of the past, the Mexican Grand Prix is back on the calendar for the first time in more than two decades, and drivers have been stopped from changing their helmet throughout the season.

Caterham are gone, but Marussia, now in the guise of Manor, have survived and after hiring Will Stevens, three Brits will line up Down Under. We’ll also see the introduction of the ‘Virtual Safety Car’...

Under new regulations, Hamilton will be forced to stick with the same helmet design (above) throughout 2015 

What’s that all about then?

In the wake of Jules Bianchi's horror crash at last year's Japanese Grand Prix, a 'Virtual Safety Car; concept has been introduced. FIA race director Charlie Whiting will deploy the system immediately after any incident which requires double waved yellows, but is not deemed severe enough for the Safety Car itself. 

The aim is to neutralise the race track and slow drivers down after Bianchi, who remains unconscious in hospital, was adjudged to have been going too fast when he crashed into the back of a tractor sent to recover Adrian Sutil’s Sauber at the rain-lashed race in Japan.

So, what time shall I set my alarm for on Sunday?

Nice and early! Another recommendation following Bianchi’s crash was to bring forward the start-time of a number of races outside Europe. Sunday's Australian Grand Prix gets underway at 5am (4pm local time), one hour earlier than last year, to avoid any danger of the race ending in darkness. You can follow the coverage of every lap on MailOnline. Sky Sports F1 will  screen the race live with highlights on the BBC.
