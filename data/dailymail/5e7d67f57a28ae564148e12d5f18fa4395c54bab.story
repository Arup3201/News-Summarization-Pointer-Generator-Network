Former Army medic Christopher Jenderseck pleaded guilty Monday to charges that he burned bloody 
clothes, spent shotgun shells and a cellphone to help his fellow soldiers 
cover up a double murder linked to a militia group 
plotting several terrorist attacks.

Jenderseck told a Liberty County 
Superior Court judge he built the backyard bonfire used to dispose of the items 
last December.

He said his fellow soldiers did not tell him was he was 
destroying evidence to cover up a killing, though he figured it out as the fire 
burned.

Brett Roark, father of Michael Roark and Brenda Thomas, mother of Tiffany York, and Morgan York, sister of Tiffany York, from left, listen to Former Pfc. Christopher Jenderseck give testimony Monday.

Jenderseck also admitted he did nothing to stop them.

“I was ashamed of myself that I let myself become a part of this,” the 
26-year-old Iraq veteran told the judge.

Jenderseck was the second defendant to plead guilty in a case that’s stunned 
this military community near the Georgia coast.

Ten people, including eight current and former Fort Stewart soldiers, have 
been jailed on charges that they belonged to an anti-government group that 
prosecutors say plotted several terrorists acts and ultimately had plans to assassinate the President of the United States.

According to Jenderseck, Michael Roark, 19, and girlfriend Tiffany York, 17, were killed when because Geroegia militia members thought they knew too much about their terrorist plans.

Authorities began investigating the group last December 
after local fishermen discovered the bodies of recently discharged soldier 
Michael Roark,19, and his 17-year-old girlfriend, Tiffany York.

Both had been shot 
in the head and their bodies left in the woods.

Christopher Jenderseck admitted to destroying clothing, shotgun shells and a cellphone after the December killings of Roark and York. He agreed to testify against other defendants.

Four Fort Stewart soldiers were soon arrested in the slayings, and to being part of a militia group that had stockpiled more than $87,000 worth of guns and bomb materials.

Prosecutors say Roark and York were killed because they knew about the militia 
group.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

But prosecutors said Jenderseck’s only involvement was helping the others 
burn a cellphone, spent shotgun shells used in the killings and clothing the 
shooters wore that was spattered with blood and brain matter.

Investigators 
later found charred remains of those items in the backyard of Army Sgt. Anthony 
Peden, who’s charged with being one of the shooters.

“Mr. Jenderseck was not present” during the killings, Durden told reporters 
after court. “Although he was a member of the group, he was not involved 
directly in the homicides.”

That’s one reason why prosecutors agreed to let Jenderseck, who had been 
jailed since mid-September, serve the rest of his seven-year sentence on 
probation. His defense attorney, Jarrett Maillet, said Jenderseck planned to 
return to Fargo, N.D., where he enrolled in college after his enlistment with 
the Army ended in April.

Jenderseck’s plea deal requires him to testify against the other defendants 
in the case and against any new suspects who may be charged later on.

Prosecutor Isabel Pauley told the judge Monday that Aguigui recruited 
Jenderseck into his militia group last year at a time when he was 
psychologically vulnerable -- Jenderseck had recently finished a tour in Iraq and 
had problems at home including the death of his grandfather, a failed marriage and the suicide death of a friend and fellow soldier.

Aguigui, Pauley said, was interested in recruiting Jenderseck because he was 
a trained combat medic.

“Aguigui questioned this defendant and asked him, ‘If I were to bring you 
someone filled with holes, could you fix him up?’

Jenderseck¿s plea deal requires him to testify against the other defendants in the case and against any new suspects who may be charged later on.

Jenderseck ended up getting a tattoo on his right shoulder — the Greek 
letters alpha and omega intersecting to form an anarchy symbol — that 
prosecutors say members of Aguigui’s group wore. Jenderseck said he had the 
tattoo covered up with another after the killings because he was ashamed.

His attorney said that while Jenderseck may have been disgruntled with the 
military when he joined up with Aguigui, he wasn’t on board with carrying out 
terrorist attacks and knew little of such plots.

'The leader of this group would kind of keep them in the dark and the right 
hand didn’t know what the left had was doing,' Maillet said.

'What he did know 
about it he thought was a bunch of talk, and not so much action,' Maillet added.

Investigators say that the Georgia militia had terrorist plans for Fort Stewart (pictured) outside Savannah, Georgia.
