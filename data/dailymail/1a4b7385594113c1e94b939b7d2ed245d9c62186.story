Three Canadians were among the Islamist fighters who help two American journalists hostage in Syria for two years, a new report reveals.

Theo Curtis and Matt Schrier have both been freed after being held together by al-Nusra Front,  the al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group  fighting in Syria.

The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. has revealed that three of the men who brutally beat, intimidated and robbed the journalists were Canadian citizens - proving that ISIS does not have a monopoly on foreign fighters traveling to Syria for jihad. 

Theo Curtis and Matt Schrier have both been freed after being captured in between 2011 and 2013 by al-Nusra Front. Canadian jihadists were among their tormentors

Citing unnamed sources, the CBC reports that the Canadians forced the men to hand over their bank details, PINs and passwords then drained their accounts of their life savings. 

The Canadian captors then sadistically wrote emails to Mr Curtis and Mr Schriers' friends and family claiming to be the men and begged them for their bank details. 

The militants then preyed on the journalists' friends and family, as well.  

Schrier escaped from his al-Nusra Front prison last year after seven months in captivity. He described how he and Mr Curtis, his cellmate, were brutally beaten on their feet with wire cables.

Mr Curtis was free last week after the Qataris helped secure his safety following the brutal murder of journalist James Foley at the hands of ISIS. 

Brutal: Al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, is also apparently stocked with foreign fighters. At least 130 Canadians - and as many as 300 - have joined foreign Islamist groups (stock picture)

ISIS beheaded journalist Steven Sotloff in a similarly barbaric video that was released online Tuesday.

The Canadian government has acknowledged that Canadians have been leaving the country to join jihadist groups - putting the number at about 130.

However, a CBC investigation has revealed that as many as 300 Canadian citizens are fighting with Islamist organizations in Syria and Iraq. 

Al-Nusra Front was regarded as one of the most radical and violent Islamist groups fighting in the Syrian Civil War until the rise of ISIS - whose methods were so brutal that even al-Qaeda has distanced itself.
