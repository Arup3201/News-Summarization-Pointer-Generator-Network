A transgendered man permitted to use the women's locker rooms at a Washington college has created uproar among parents who say their children have been repeatedly exposed by him.

At the center of the controversy, Colleen Francis, a 45-year-old student at Olympia's Evergreen College who identifies as a woman but with male genitalia, says she has a right to use the facilities and the school agrees.

'The college cannot discriminate based on the basis of gender identity,' Evergreen Spokesman Jason Wettstein told KOMO. 'Gender identity is one of the protected things in discrimination law in this state.'

Taking their own action, however, parents of children who use the facility - sharing the pool's locker room with a high school swim club and children’s swim academy – have turned to the police.

'[A mother] reported her daughter was upset because she observed a person at the women's locker room naked and displaying male genitalia,' a police report filed by a 17-year-old's mother in September read.

A second report filed by an outside swim coach stated having ‘observed Colleen sitting with her legs open with her male genitalia showing’ in the sauna before telling her she had to leave and calling police.

'Little girls should not be exposed to naked men, period,' David Hacker, senior legal counsel with the Alliance Defending Freedom told Fox News.

Contacted by upset parents, the alliance has warned the college to readdress their permission.

The college retorts that they're only following state law and have since put up privacy curtains for the women who may feel uncomfortable.

'This is not 1959 Alabama. We don't call 
the police for drinking from the wrong water fountain,' Ms Francis, the 
student at the heart of the issue, spoke out to KIRO.

That swim coach who called police that day says she did apologize to Ms Francis for questioning her, ‘bus she also explained there were girls 6 to 18 years of age and they were not use to seeing individuals in situations like this.’

The school has since set up a smaller, isolated section of the locker room for girls to change in, until the matter is resolved.

Unpacified, Mr Hecker has warned the school that should any harm come to the girls affected by this, they will be held accountable.

'Clearly, allowing a person who is biologically a man to undress and 
expose himself to young girls places those girls at risk for emotional 
distress and harm,' he wrote to the college.

'Any reasonable
 person would view this as dangerous to the young girls involved. The 
fact that this individual was sitting in plain view of young girls 
changing into their swimsuits puts you and Evergreen on notice of 
possible future harm.'
