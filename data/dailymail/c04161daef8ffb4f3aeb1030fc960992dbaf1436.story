When Ellie Goulding posed for a picture in her Halloween costume, she probably expected fans to admire her ‘beautiful’ Native American outfit.

What she might not have expected was to find herself at the centre of a race row.

But within minutes of sharing the snap on the internet, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding singer had been branded ‘racist’, ‘ignorant’, ‘insensitive’ and ‘deeply offensive’, and was told that wearing a Native American costume was ‘no different than wearing black face’.

Miss Goulding, 27, was following the example of dozens of stars – including singer Sinitta, Coleen Rooney, Cher, Harry Styles and Pharrell Williams – who have been pictured wearing Native American headdresses in recent months.

The British star shared pictures of the skimpy outfit with her 3.6million Instagram followers and a similar number on Twitter. 

But she was met with hundreds of messages of disgust, with one fan accusing her of ‘promoting racism and cultural appropriation’ and another telling her ‘cultures are not costumes’.

One critic wrote: ‘Next time don’t mock a dying race you insensitive and ignorant excuse of a person.’ 

Another added: ‘Oh Ellie I’m so disappointed. No different than wearing black face.’

However, Conservative MP Philip Davies last night called on the singer to ‘stick to her guns’, saying: ‘As far as I’m concerned, all of these people who are complaining are idiots. 

'I never cease to be amazed at how easily people will take offence – and usually this is white, middle-class, Guardian-reading, sandal-wearing, politically correct do-gooders who are offended on someone else’s behalf. 

'The people concerned are never usually offended themselves.’

Miss Goulding also received support from Crystal Speer, who works for the Native American Heritage Association in the United States. 

While the organisation does not have an official opinion on the matter, Mrs Speer said in a personal capacity: ‘I do think [the reaction] is a bit much. People these days will jump at anything to get offended at.

'I can see both sides but unless you’re Native American yourself I don’t think it’s right for you to say whether it’s offensive or not.’

The row comes just weeks after it was announced that Glastonbury will no longer allow Native American headdresses to be sold at festival outlets, in response to a petition.

Miss Goulding declined to comment on the furore yesterday but responded to some of her critics on Twitter, posting: ‘I wore that beautiful unauthentic headpiece for about five minutes.’ 

She also pledged to donate to the Running Strong campaign, which gives grants to organisations supporting Native American young people.
