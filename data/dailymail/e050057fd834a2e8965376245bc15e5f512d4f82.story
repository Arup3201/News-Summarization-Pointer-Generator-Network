E-numbers, television and chemicals have all been traditionally blamed for causing hyperactivity in children.

But a new study suggests living near a noisy road can lead to the condition.

Youngsters who were exposed to the highest noise levels at home showed 28 per cent more symptoms of hyperactivity and inattention than those exposed to the lowest traffic noise levels, researchers found.

Noise pollution and sleep deprivation can affect emotional wellbeing, German researchers found

Michelle Bosquet, a psychologist at Boston Children's Hospital, says that noise pollution can have a dramatic affect on children's behaviour and their mental wellbeing.

The loud noises lead to broken sleep and can affect behaviour

Ms Bosquet, who was not involved in the German study, says that traffic noise can disturb a child's sleep or concentration, which could be linked to hyperactivity.

Researchers led by Carla Tiesler at the Helmholtz Zentrum German Research Center for Environmental Health studied 900 children living in Munic, NBC reported.

Noise levels outside of each child's home at the wall of the house were measured, and parents answered a questionnaire about their 10-year-olds' behaviour.

Youngsters who lived in the homes with the highest level of noise were more than twice as likely to show unusual emotional behaviour - such as anxiety - than those in the quietest properties, according to NBC.

After researchers considered sleeping 
problems, they also concluded that difficulty in going to sleep was also
responsible for emotional difficulties.

Nearly
8 per cent of U.S children between three and 17-years-old have been 
diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention have said.

The study's authors considered other factors which can influence behaviour - such as the subjects' exercise levels - but said that other variables than sleep deprivation and noise could cause ADHD.

chemical pollution and sound-proofing were not measured

The study was published online in March in the journal Environmental Research.

The study comes after a leading U.S doctor believes that many cases of diagnosed ADHD are in fact sleeping disorders in disguise.

Vatsal Thakkar, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine, says he is treating an increasing number of people with ADHD symptoms but who actually have suffer with poor quality sleep.

For some people - especially children - sleep deprivation does not necessarily cause lethargy; instead they become hyperactive, forgetful and unfocused, he said.

ADHD is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness.

It is normally diagnosed between the ages of three to seven, and it is more common in boys.

Although the cause of ADHD is not known, research shows that it tends to run in families.
