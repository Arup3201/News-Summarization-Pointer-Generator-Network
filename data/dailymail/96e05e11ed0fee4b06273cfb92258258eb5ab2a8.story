A man has been left with multiple injuries after a pair of teenagers came at him with a handsaw in an attempt to steal his mobile phone.

Shaun Chapman made a heroic escape from the 'unprovoked and vicious attack', but ended up in hospital with two black eyes and cuts and bruises all over his face.

The 21-year-old was on his way to a family birthday party at a pub in his home town of Stroud, Gloucestershire on Friday night when he walked through a subway beneath the road.

Two teenagers came up to him, and one said, 'Excuse me blood, you've got something for me,' then demanded his phone.

Mr Chapman, who works at Tesco, refused to hand over the device, at which point the youths began to punch and kick him.

One of them then produced a handsaw, but their victim managed to break the blade and run off to the pub where his family was gathered.

'I shoved one of them away and the other pulled out the saw,' Mr Chapman said today. 'A couple of punches were thrown and I tried to run into town but they caught me in the subway.

'They had me against the wall and were punching me in the face. I tripped over and I was on the floor and I could see them trying to kick me in the face.

'I knew I just had to get away and my face was battered. I got up and I saw one of them coming at me with the blade. I grabbed it and managed to break the blade and just ran.'

The victim was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital to be treated for his injuries, and was discharged a few hours later.

Inspector Tony Fisk, from Gloucestershire Police, said officers were investigating an 'unprovoked and vicious attack'.

A police spokesman said: 'The victim, a 21-year-old man from Stroud, was walking along the underpass when he was approached by two men.

'One of the men asked for the victim's mobile phone. The second offender has then produced a weapon, thought to be a small hand saw.

'After a scuffle, the victim has fallen to the ground. Once on the ground the victim has been kicked and punched causing facial injuries and was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.'

The robbers are both white, and thought to be between 17 and 18 years old.

The first is described as 6ft, of medium build, with acne and short wavy black hair. He was wearing a black McKenzie jacket with white Nike Air Max trainers.

The second was over 6ft, of a stockier build, with short dark hair and was wearing a black McKenzie hoodie.
