Nigel Pearson has been charged with using insulting language by the FA over his foul-mouthed row with a Leicester City fan.

The Leicester manager was filmed appearing to tell an abusive supporter to ‘f*** off and die’ after being called an ‘utter t***’ near the end of City’s defeat by Liverpool at the King Power Stadium on December 2.

Pearson has until 6pm on Tuesday to respond but has so far been unrepentant. He said last week: ‘I’m more than happy to stand up for myself in that situation. If people were offended then that is regrettable but there is no need to apologise to somebody of that ilk.’

The FA statement read: ‘It is alleged that during the fixture Mr Pearson used abusive and/or insulting words towards a spectator.’

If Pearson accepts the charge or is found guilty, he faces a fine and touchline ban — although he already elects to sit in the stands during matches. His expletive-fuelled exchange came when he travelled to the dugout for the closing stages.

Pearson made the decision to move to the stands after serving a one-match touchline ban for clashing with officials after a game in August 2013.

Alan Pardew was given a three-match stadium ban last March — but that was for the much more serious offence of headbutting David Meyler. In April 2011, Wayne Rooney was suspended for two games for swearing into a television camera, while Luis Suarez was handed a one-match ban in December that year for making an obscene gesture to Fulham fans.

An Independent Regulatory Commission will decide any potential sanction if the charge is proven. Yesterday, before the FA made their announcement, Pearson was tight-lipped. ‘I have said as much as I want to say on that subject, regardless of what happens here on in I won’t be saying much more,’ he said. ‘My focus is totally on this next game and we welcome the champions.’

Pearson’s preparations for the visit of Manchester City were dealt a huge blow after Kasper Schmeichel suffered a broken metatarsal during training yesterday morning.

The Denmark goalkeeper will undergo an operation today and has been ruled out for at least a month — but Pearson admitted that diagnosis was optimistic and it ‘could be longer’ depending on the surgeon’s findings.

‘There was no contact. Normally what happens with those injuries is a stress situation, foot to the floor,’ said Pearson. ‘Clearly the lad’s distressed about it — he will be a big miss for us but what you have to do is deal with it.’

Ben Hamer will step up for the City game — having kept a clean sheet at Stoke in September — but Pearson admitted he was likely to dip into the transfer market.

‘I would have thought so,’ he said. ‘If he’s going to be four to six weeks at the earliest then I’ll be considering options certainly.’

England Under 21 goalkeeper Jack Butland, back at Stoke following an emergency loan spell at Derby, and Mark Schwarzer, third choice at Chelsea, would both be available.
