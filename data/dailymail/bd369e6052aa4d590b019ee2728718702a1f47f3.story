Ed Balls admitted yesterday that the falling oil price will make people feel better off.

The Shadow Chancellor said the plunging price of oil ‘will help’ households. His words were an apparent admission that the party’s cost of living campaign was being undermined by falling inflation.

A report published yesterday showed the public will see a ‘substantial boost to their spending power’ this year as wages surge ahead of prices.

Mr Balls made his comments at the launch of a major report by the Commission on Inclusive Prosperity into declining middle class incomes in wealthy countries.

Mr Balls criticised the government for ‘waiting for things to improve…because the evidence is that’s not going to happen.’

He added: ‘It is true at the moment we have a fall in the oil price which will help.’

‘But the fall in the oil price is no more a solution to these long term problems than the rise in the oil price in the 1970s was the main cause of economic challenge in Britain. There were considerably deeper economic challenges we faced at the time.’

Mr Balls said: ‘In our country in a couple of months time we will have a general election where the median person in work will be absolutely worse off than they were in 2010.

‘That has not happened in any Parliament in our country since the 1920s.

Tory Treasury Minister David Gauke said: ‘Our Long Term Economic Plan is working with real incomes forecast to rise for families this year. But the job is not yet done and we must carrying on working through our plan to secure a better economic future.

‘Even though their economic argument is collapsing, Labour would abandon our plan. Their economic policy consists of more spending, more borrowing and more debt which would lead to economic chaos.’

He criticised the Government claiming they were 'waiting for things to improve' financially 

On Sunday, Labour’s deputy leader, Harriet Harman, raised the ‘cost of living’ eight times in a television interview as she argued ordinary people are not feeling better off.

But her claims appeared to be undermined by forecasts of a buoyant economy, growing wages and falling prices.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics are expected to show this week that average earnings excluding bonuses are nearly two per cent higher than a year ago.
