A mother is furious after she was ordered to leave a cinema showing a 15-rated film because she had her baby daughter with her.

Sam Ross was told she was 'breaking the law' by taking her baby to raunchy comedy Bad Neighbours - even though the 11-week-old girl is too young to understand any film.

The cinema now says that she should never have been sold a ticket, as age limits are strictly enforced even for infants.

Anger: Sam Ross was thrown out of the Vue cinema in Cambridge along with her 11-week-old daughter

The 30-year-old mother of two had gone to the Vue cinema in Cambridge with a friend, and both had bought tickets but were asked to leave before the film started.

'It was totally humiliating, we were escorted out,' Ms Ross said. 'I was really looking forward to watching the movie and catching up with a friend.

'As a new parent I don't get out that often and it can be difficult to find things you can do with friends.

'We were told we were breaking the law and that it was a criminal offence. It felt like we were being discriminated against. It's never been a problem before.'

The pair were eventually given a refund for their tickets, but only after a 'long, infuriating' conversation with the cinema's manager.

Raunchy: Bad Neighbours, starring Zac Efron, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne, is a 15-rated comedy

Bad Neighbours is a 15-rated film about young parents, played by Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne, who are trapped in a feud with Zac Efron, playing the leader of a fraternity which has moved in next door to them.

The film features repeated swear words, sexual innuendo and violent slapstick humour.

However, Ms Ross insisted that there was no reason why she should not have taken her infant daughter to the screening.

'At just 11 weeks old my daughter is totally oblivious to what's going on, she would have just gone off to sleep,' she said. 'It was a comedy not a violent film.

'If she was screaming and interrupting everyone I would totally understand and would never stay in the cinema, but she was completely fine. There were only six other people in the whole room.'

A spokesman for Vue cinemas said that small children were only allowed in to U, PG and 12A-rated films, in accordance with official guidelines.

'On this particular occasion the customer should have been advised that babies are not permitted into 15 certificate films and declined the sale,' he said.

'Vue Entertainment apologises for any inconvenience caused and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn't happen again in future.'

An editor at parenting website Mumsnet said that it was normal for mothers to take small children to films which they cannot understand.

'The cinema can be a great place for a new mum and a small baby as most tiny babies are unaffected by the noise and sleep throughout the film,' Emilie Carrington said.

'It can feel great to get out of the house and do something "grown up". However, many Mumsnetters recommend going to screenings designated for mums with babies.'
