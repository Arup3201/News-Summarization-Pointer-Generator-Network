Immigration authorities are reviewing the case of a U.S. Army veteran and Cuban native who recently discovered he is not an American citizen despite having lived in the country for more than half a century.

Mario Hernandez, 58, served in the Army during the Vietnam War and worked for the federal government, using a Social Security number he received when he arrived in the country as a child fleeing Castro's Cuba.

The Tallahassee man always believed he was a U.S. citizen, and ironically, only made the startling discovery when he sought a passport to take a cruise with his wife celebrating his retirement after 22 years working in the Federal Bureau of Prisons - an agency that requires citizenship and frequent background checks.

Citizenship nightmare: Mario Hernandez, who has lived in the U.S. since he was a nine-year-old, only recently discovered he is not a citizen - or even a resident

That Caribbean cruise would have been his first venture out of the U.S. since coming here nearly a half century ago.

Instead of a well-earned holiday, suddenly Hernandez was in limbo and under investigation by the U.S. government, unable to leave for fear that he may be denied re-entry to the country he's called home for almost his entire life.

'I feel like my heart's been ripped out of my chest, I really do,' he told CBS.

'It is difficult to even speak about it, it really it,' he said, choking back tears.

Since the Cuban revolution, those who 
leave the communist-run island generally get fast-tracked to U.S. 
residency, after which they can apply for citizenship. Hernandez arrived
 in 1965 as a nine-year-old with his mother and always assumed she had filed immigration 
papers.

He married here, and had two children, one of whom is an Afghanistan war veteran.

'I served this 
country,' Hernandez said. 'I've always tried to prove I'm a good 
American citizen. I have always taught my children and grandchildren we 
need to be good stewards of this country. My parents came for freedom. 
We owe a lot to this country.'

American dream: Hernandez arrived as a refugee from Cuba and was issued a social security number and temporary paperwork, never realizing that his parents had not filed the relevant paperwork for him to become a permanent citizen

Serving his country: Hernandez served in the Vietnam war and worked for the federal government for 22 years - and no one ever questioned his citizenship

The New York Times points out that as a Cuban refugee and military veteran, Hernandez won't face deportation, but he can no longer vote, nor can he leave the country. He faces prison and fines for falsely claiming citizenship.

'I thought I was a citizen - Iâ€™ve always been proud of being a citizen,' Hernandez told The New York Times. 'This has really messed with my head.'

U.S. Citizens and Immigration Services Spokesman Christopher Bentley said Thursday his agency is reviewing the case and will meet with Hernandez and his attorney, Elizabeth Ricci. Ricci said a meeting was scheduled for next week.

'When an error is discovered, either 
through the appeals process or by other means, we work diligently to 
review the case and take steps to correct the error and prevent similar 
issues from occurring in the future,' he said in a statement.

Ricci
 said Hernandez's years of service in the military and his work guarding
 criminals, including Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, should be 
rewarded not punished.

In
 recent months, however, she said officials have been asking detailed 
questions about why Hernandez voted, suggesting they might be interested
 in filing charges related to voter fraud.

Retirement: It wasn't until Hernandez and his wife decided to take a cruise to celebrate his retirement after 22 years working for the Federal Bureau of Prisons  that a passport application revealed the secret

Bureaucracy: Now, instead of relaxing in the Caribbean, Hernandez may face prison and fines for voting when not a citizen

She described the bureaucratic process as 'inefficiency in the extreme.'

Citing Hernandez's clean record, work history, tax payments and military service, she said, 'I'm hopeful and optimistic, but it's cautious optimism.'

'I think they are gravely embarrassed,' Ricci said of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 'and are trying to shift the burden on him now to make him look like a criminal.'

Elizabeth C. Pines, a Miami immigration lawyer told The New York Times that she had encountered similar cases but none as extreme as Hernandez's.

'It goes to show you how broken the system is for a federal and a state agency to have not even checked his background - his criminal background, yes, but not his immigration background,' she said.

For Hernandez, his name being stripped from voting rolls was akin to having part of his identity removed. He broke down crying and couldn't tell friends about it.

'We should be enjoying this time in our life,' said Hernandez's wife Bonita. 'Not living in fear that something bad might happen to him.'
