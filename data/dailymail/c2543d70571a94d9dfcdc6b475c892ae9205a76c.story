A teenage beauty queen survived a horrifying car crash on an accident blackspot en route to her first ever pageant - but still managed to make it on time.

Gemma Hartery, from Old Conwy, Wales, was on her way to her Miss Wales selection interview when her boyfriend Ellis' Ford Fiesta flipped on to its roof on the notorious Snake Pass road near Macclesfield, Cheshire.

An air ambulance was dispatched for the 19-year-old after her screams sparked fears that there was a child in the car.

But Gemma managed to escape with just a cut to her hand and her mum Cheremane Smith, 42, stepped in to get her to the interview on time.

After a two-hour trip to A&E, the International Sports Management student at the University of Derby composed herself and sailed through her selection interview.

Gemma, who had been travelling from her university digs in Buxton, Derbyshire, to the interview, said: 'We were just driving up the twisty road and there had been oil spill but there was no warning at all.

'The back end of the car went and we flipped over upside down. It was terrifying.

'We were so lucky. And I managed to escape with just a cut on my hand from the glass on the passenger side window.

'I was fine after my mum gave me some sugary drinks to calm me down and I didn't even mention it at the interview.'

Gemma, who has never competed before at a pageant, impressed judges at the Miss Wales event in Swansea last weekend, taking the Old Conwy title on Saturday.

But she missed out on the ultimate prize after being pipped by newsreader Emma Jenkins, 22, from Llanelli.

This weekend's competition will be the first time that Gemma will compete at a pageant and comes after years of caring for mum Cheremane.

Gemma has looked after her mother since she was diagnosed with breast cancer while the girl was at high school.

Although Gemma, who had never previously competed at a pageant, ultimately lost out on the Miss Wales titles, she impressed judges and took the Old Conwy title on Saturday

Cheremane has since received the all-clear but has been dealt with a devastating blow after being diagnosed with osteoperosis of the spine.

Her health issues inspired Gemma to enter the pageant after Cheremane told her to 'live her life'.

Gemma said: 'My mum told me to just go for it.

'They have basically had to rebuild her breast so I have had to look after her for years.

'The chemotherapy has really affected her joints so she couldn't move so I've had to been on hand to help out for years.'

Gemma has insisted that her mother, Cheremane (left), who escorted her to the Miss Wales pageant following the accident and who is also a survivor of breast cancer, was the one that prompted Gemma to enter the pageant, encouraging her to just 'live her life'

Gemma insists that she managed to put all her troubles behind her, even though she is juggling her modelling with her degree.

She said: 'The big thing for me is with confidence - it is something I've struggled with and I've had a hard time battling with dyslexia.

'And it was such an absolutely amazing experience - it wasn't anything like I thought it was going to be, in fact, it was a million times better.

'I said I just wanted to give a pageant a go beforehand and said I'd only do one.

'But this has given me such a big smile on my face I think I may do more.'
