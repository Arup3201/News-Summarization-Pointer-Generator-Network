It may look like an optical illusion, but there's no need to think twice.

A Latvian thrill-seeker really has joined two car fronts together in order to perform epic 360 degree turns.

What's more, the freezing weather  in his hometown of Sigulda provides the optimum conditions to take this baby out for a spin.

Artūrs Bondars created the extraordinary hybrid car - half red, half blue - with two engines and no rear end.

By fusing the fronts of a pair of VW Passats together he has ensured that he’s able to pull off perfect multiple spins - with the added bonus of freaking out passersby.

The car features two drivers seats placed next to one another in the middle of the vehicle, but facing opposite ends.

As seen in a video, which demonstrates all the fun that this wacky creation is capable of, Artūrs and a friend are utterly fearless as they let loose.

Double trouble: Artūrs Bondars from Latvia has fused together the front ends of two Volkswagen Passats

To add to the apparent danger of the situation, one door is left wide open and there is a brick wall looming behind.

But the daredevils don't seem to care as they slam down on the gas pedal.

The automobile skids through the slush resulting in one of the greatest adrenalin rushes imaginable.

The toy consists of one 1.8 litre engine and a 2.0 litre engine;  it makes for a unique take on four–wheeled drive.

Let's pray the motorists have fastened their a seat-belts.

Snow fear whatsoever! He is filmed spinning around manically in the personalised car with a friend in very dangerous conditions

Ultimate thrill: The two drivers sit next to each other, but face opposite ends as it spins
