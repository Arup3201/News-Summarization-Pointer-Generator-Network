Even the most expensive, lightweight earphones feel a little alien when pushed into the inner ear.

But a San Diego-based firm is hoping to change this with custom-made buds that are perfectly moulded to the wearer’s ears' shape and size.

Called OwnPhones, they’re also completely wireless and sync to phones and music players through Bluetooth.

Each wireless OwnPhone is custom-made to fit the wearer’s ear (illustration pictured). Colours, styles and materials of individual OwnPhones can be personalised, and the firm claims there are more than 10,000 possible combinations

Customers begin by taking a photo of their ear and uploading it to a  smartphone app.

This image is analysed using specialist software, which plots the size, shape and curves of the outer ear, as well the part of the inner ear that is visible.

These scans are used to create a 3D-printed model.  

Sound-wise, the firm claims that because the OwnPhones sit in the ear snuggly, they block out a certain level of noise.

However, to cancel out all other noises, the OwnPhones use what the company calls Soundscaping.

Wearers can also use the app to let certain sounds penetrate the earphones including an alarm, or a friend’s voice.

OwnPhones are available to pre-order from Kickstarter for $149 (£88).

Each earphone can also be personalised with a variety of colours, styles and materials.

The company, founded by San Diego-based Itamar Jobani, claims there are more than 10,000 possible combinations of Ownphones.

OwnPhones use these scans to build a virtual model of the ear before 3D printing an earphone to fit this comfortably.
