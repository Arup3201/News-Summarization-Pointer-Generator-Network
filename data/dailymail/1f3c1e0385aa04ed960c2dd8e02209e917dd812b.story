By the time Jordan Henderson caught up with all the transfer comings and goings before he went to bed on Monday night, Barclays Premier League clubs had spent more than £800million this summer.

Most of that was on overseas signings, adding to the glamour of the Premier League and damaging the future of the national team by reducing the chances for young English players.

Henderson  recognises that the appeal of the Premier League and the phenomenal salaries on offer are major dangers to our national team.

‘Obviously the Premier League is a great league and players want to come and play in it — that’s a big part of it,’ said the England midfielder. ‘If they do well against England, they might feel as though they can come and get an opportunity to play in England.

‘It’s one of the best leagues in the world, so that’s a part of it.’

Last weekend the Big Five — Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea — fielded 11 English players between them.

Two of those, John Terry and Steven Gerrard, are no longer available for international duty.

Henderson is a deep thinker, a decent guy who accepts that Roy Hodgson’s squad failed the country when they returned home from the World Cup without a win.

At England’s hotel on Monday, he nominated Gerrard and Wayne Rooney as two players from that failed mission who could have got into Germany’s triumphant squad. ‘Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney are world-class players,’ he said. ‘We also have a lot of young players who could get to that level, such as Raheem Sterling. With the right mentality and the right coaching, they could get there.

‘Germany won the World Cup, so they are operating on a very high level and a level we want to get to. They did very well at the World Cup. They had a bit of luck at times, which you need. They are a good unit, they are defensively solid and great going forward.’

Indeed, it will be difficult for any team to match a side comprising Toni Kroos, Manuel Neuer, Mats Hummels, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Mesut Ozil and Thomas Muller.

And the truth is that no-one fears this England team, not even Wednesday’s opponents Norway. Hodgson’s squad are fragile.

They need to stare out the opposition in the tunnel and make sure they know they will be in a game when they take on England. Instead of instilling fear in their opponents, England are frightened.

‘Playing for Liverpool and England is totally different,’ Henderson admitted. ‘People have to fear England and not want to play us. The only way to do that is to play at a higher tempo and win games.

‘At Liverpool, the philosophy under Brendan got driven into the players and we have improved all the time. He got his messages across well. Hopefully we can carry on and progress as individuals and bring that to England as best we can.’

Rodgers’ ability to get the best from his team was clear on Sunday, when Henderson played with control and composure in the centre of Liverpool’s midfield alongside Joe Allen and former England captain Gerrard.

Henderson is a maturing voice around the England camp and he knows the stakes have been raised after the FA admitted they only expect around 40,000 fans at Wembley on Wednesday evening. People don’t trust this team, the manager or the FA and Henderson is sharp enough to accept that is the price to pay for a shocking World Cup.

‘We have to go out there and show we deserve to be in the England team, show how much we care and show how good we are,’ added Henderson.

‘There’s going to be 40-odd thousand there, which is low for Wembley but still a good turn-out to watch a game.

‘I don’t think it will affect us too much and hopefully they can support us as much as possible and we can show them how much it matters to us and make them want to go to the games.

‘We are expected to do well but whoever says that players don’t care about putting on an England shirt is talking nonsense.

‘Every player with this squad definitely cares. If you had been in the dressing room after the Uruguay game, you would see how much we care as players.’

The tear-stained shirts are all well and good, but what the nation demands is some evidence that England can one day go deep into tournaments. They are a million miles away at the moment.

Henderson knows that, but in the absence of Gerrard and Frank Lampard, he will take on more responsibility. He is a first-choice player now. ‘When you play for England there is always going to be pressure, that is normal,’ he added.

Against Norway, it must be the start of a whole new era.

End of an era: Frank Lampard, on loan at Manchester City, announced his international retirement last month
