It's oatmeal....but not as you know it

Foie gras with truffle sauce, monkfish liver with pancetta jus....we've heard of haute cuisine, now it's time for 'oat cuisine'.

Think of the word porridge and you will probably remember the steaming pile of Quaker Oats served up to keep you warm on the journey to school.

But rather unexpectedly, this most solid of cereals has become a gourmet dish.

Top New York chef Samantha Stephens is championing an exotic range of recipes that use the Scottish oats as their base. She calls her approach Extreme Oatmeal.

Abandoning traditional toppings such as honey and milk, she serves porridge with pesto sauce, pumpkin puree and bacon.

The menu includes Indian spiced oatmeal with raisins, sliced almonds, coconut milk, crystallised ginger, cardamom, vanilla and brown sugar; and Canadian oatmeal served with bacon, cheddar cheese, roasted apples, maple syrup and sea salt.

But there's no need to travel to New York to partake in the Extreme Oatmeal trend. Porridge is so simple to make that anyone can experiment with unconventional ingredients.

Flavours that suit risotto tend to work well with porridge.

So how about a bowl of mushroom, parmesan and pancetta porridge for breakfast tomorrow?

Flavours which work well with risotto also work with oats

Who said porridge was boring?

Originally from Fairfax, Samantha Stephens now lives in New York City where she OatMeals, the cosy dining room in which she puts 'modern twists on an old-fashioned wholesome favourite'.

Her idea for gourmet porridge stemmed from being an impoverished student looking for ways of spicing up cheap oats.

These days, from her pretty perch on 3rd Street, Stephens uses her colourful imagination to conjure up ideas both sweet and savoury for warming, comforting, health-giving bowls of oatiny goodness.

Some of the most decadent sounding concoctions served in OatMeals are the Pumpkin Pie - made from a pumpkin purée swirl, pecans, brown sugar, pumpkin spice and whole milk - the Shaved Parmesan - extra virgin olive oil, flaky sea salt, cracked pepper, bacon topping recommended - and the the Croque Monsieur - diced ham, gruyere cheese, nutmeg, steamed milk.

The squidgy  treats can also be made to order with ingredients including Gorgonzola, carob chips, chia seesds, butterscotch chips, truffle oil, agave nectar, ginger, mini-marshmallows, pineapple and pesto. Though we do recommend you don't try them out all at once.

OatMeals is situated at 120 W 3rd St, between Macdougal and 6th Ave.
