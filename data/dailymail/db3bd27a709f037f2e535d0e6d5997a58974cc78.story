Much more than a bag: Judge Zoe Smith told the bag snatcher in court that the crime was not just inconvenient but caused fear as well

To the thief who snatched it, it was just a handbag.

But to his victim, the bag was a source of security and peace of mind, without which she was unable even to feel safe in her own home, a woman judge told a defendant in court.

Crown court judge Zoe Smith was incensed after Kamran Latif suggested that he had merely ‘inconvenienced’ women when he stole their bags.

Judge Smith, who has more than 40 
years of courtroom experience, brought a sentencing hearing to a virtual
standstill as she scolded the defendant, telling the courtroom that men
simply did not understand the real impact of such a theft.

Without her handbag, a woman  is robbed of her security and ability  to get home safely, the senior  judge said.

Even once she gets home she cannot feel safe because of the fear that a stranger has her house keys, the judge added. 

She
told Reading Crown Court last Monday: ‘It is not just inconvenience, it
causes fear as well. Her phone is taken, her cards, her money to get a 
cab is taken, her keys to the door of her house.

'Stealing a woman's bag isn't just an inconvenience... There's the fear of someone breaking into her house.'

‘Then there is the fear of anyone coming to break into the house.

‘It’s a terrible thing to do and girls are left stranded on their own.’ 

Latif had admitted stealing two handbags from women, snatching the bags in town centre bars and cafes.

One of his victims, Hannah Williams, wrote to the court about the impact of the theft, saying it had ‘caused her great upset’.

In her written statement, she said: ‘When I want to go out and have no money, I don’t go out stealing.’

Latif, 34, from Reading, also pleaded
guilty to the theft of alcohol worth £155 from a supermarket, and 
driving away from a petrol station without paying for fuel worth £20.

He asked for 38 similar offences to be taken into consideration. Lisa Goddard, prosecuting, said he pleaded guilty to the offences on June 20 this year.

But on the same day he stole another handbag in a café, and struck again in a nearby shop the next day.

The former drug abuser had a history of other offences dating back to 1996 and was previously jailed for burglary and importing drugs.

Edward Culver, defending, said his client had managed ‘a degree of abstinence’ from drugs since getting married in 2008.  He asked the judge to spare him a jail sentence and said he had a supportive family.

But Judge Smith said Latif had probably used the same argument when he pleaded guilty and asked for bail, before going straight out and committing more offences.

She said: ‘No doubt he said in his bail application he had a supportive family and that he was going to behave himself.’ 

She postponed the sentencing until December and allowed Latif to remain on bail until then.

But she warned him that he must get a job to find the money to compensate his victims, and stay crime and drug-free.

Any criminal offences would result in an immediate jail sentence, she said.

‘It will be a substantial sentence,’ the judge added.
