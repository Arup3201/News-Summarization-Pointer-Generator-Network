The end is nigh for Apple's iPhone 5C. 

Reports claim  the device, which was billed as a low-cost iPhone and was designed to appeal to a wider audience, is to be killed off as early as next summer.

Manufacturers will begin winding down production of the handset from January, and are expected to pull the plug completely by the 'middle of 2015.' 

Reports claim the 2013 iPhone 5C (pictured), which was billed as a low-cost iPhone and was designed to appeal to a wider audience, is to be killed off as early as next summer.

Apple launched its iPhone 5C alongside the high-end iPhone 5S in September 2013. 

It is similar in size to the 5S, but doesn't t have the Touch ID fingerprint scanner or the A7 processor seen in the more expensive model.

Amidst the furore of the iPhone 6 launch in September, Apple silently killed off its Classic iPod.

But it wasn't a drop in sales that brought about its demise, according to boss Tim Cook, instead it was blamed on a lack of mechanical parts.

Speaking at the WSJD Live conference, Mr Cook said the tech giant no longer had access to the components needs to make the once iconic music player.

And although sales for the product had fallen significantly in recent years, sourcing parts was the final nail in the coffin.

Mr Cook added the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts, but it wouldn't have been cost-effective and would have involved a 'massive' task. 

It has a plastic case, is available in five different colours, and at launch, prices started at $99 in the US, on a two-year contract, or $549 and £469 when bought outright. 

The device was also the first Apple phone to be offered in the smaller 8GB model. 

The report, by Taiwan's Industrial and Commercial times, did not reveal the reasons behind the plans, but Apple has previously been known to discontinue models as they are replaced by newer versions.

Sales of the 5C were also poor, compared to the company's expectations, and in January, research firm CIRP reports the model accounted for just 27 per cent of iPhone sales at the end of 2013. 

It recently killed off its iPod Classic.

When Apple’s online store came back online following its iPhone 6 event in September, this later model was missing from the iPod lineup.

Apple did not make any formal announcement about ceasing the line at the time. 

Apple boss Tim Cook later said the firm could have redesigned the gadget with different parts, but it wouldn't have been cost-effective and would have involved a 'massive' task.

The report did not reveal the reasons behind the plans, but Apple has previously been known to discontinue models as they are replaced by newer versions. Sales of the 5C (pictured at launch with Apple executive Phil Schiller) were also lower than the company's expectations

Apple is said to be forsaking its iPhone 5C to focus on production of its high-end iPhone 6 range (pictured)

'We couldn't get the parts anymore, not anywhere on Earth,' explained Mr Cook.

'It wasn't a matter of me swinging the axe, saying "What can I kill today?"

The Classic was the Apple’s first digital music player, and although the original debuted in 2001, there were six generations released up until 2007.

Apple is said to be forsaking its iPhone 5C to focus on production of its high-end iPhone 6 range.
