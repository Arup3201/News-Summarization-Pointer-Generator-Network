It's been a difficult year for 
Myleene Klass, who was devastated when her husband Graham Quinn walked 
out on her after just six months of marriage, but it seems the TV 
presenter still has the magic touch when it comes to fashion.

The
34-year-old Littlewoods brand ambassador has worked wonders for the online department store, whose embellished fuchsia pencil 
dress designed and worn by the star in its autumn advertising 
campaign as its first ever social media sell-out.

Although Littlewoods launched the television strand of the campaign, which features the concept of ‘the Littlewoods touch’ last night, the dress had already sold out of its initial stock after adverts were aired online on Tuesday via Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and YouTube making it a huge social media success.

And if that wasn't impressive enough, the £75 dress is now expected to hit sales of 2,000 by Christmas, making it one of the brand’s best ever sellers.

A spokesman for Littlewoods said: 'This is the first time ever that a Littlewoods garment has sold out as a direct result of social media buzz. There’s no doubt that Myleene designed a show stopping dress but the level of demand has completely blown us away, surpassing our initial projections by more than 400 per cent.

'For us, the record spike in sales of the fuchsia dress highlights three things – the power of social media, the level of engagement of our social fans and followers, and the superb knack that Myleene has of tapping into the fashion psyche of real women.'

Following the premiere of the autumn advert on ITV last night, traffic to the fuchsia dress page of Littlewoods.com shot up by more than 1,200 per cent when compared with the same time last week, with orders increasing by more than 700 per cent.

The Spokesman added: 'Our autumn ads will continue to appear on TV, in print and online for the remainder of September and throughout October. Despite the unprecedented level of demand for the fuchsia dress, we’ve pulled out all of the stops and are expecting delivery of a further few hundred pieces in the coming weeks.

'Many of those have been pre-allocated so shoppers need to move quickly. But the good news is that all customers who pre-order the garment over the next few days will receive it by the end of November – well in time for the Christmas party season!'

The advert itself sees Myleene, dressed in the show-stopping dress, glide through a playground filled with women riding on a carousel.

'I am delighted to be working as a brand ambassador for Littlewoods,' Myleene said earlier this year.

'As
a busy working mum, I know the importance of being able to shop how I 
want, no matter where I am and Littlewoods lets me do just that.

'Collaborating with the team on my 
fashion range allows me to work with a brand which I have known and 
loved since childhood and it also lets me share my design ideas and 
bring them to life.

'I’m looking forward to inspiring others through my latest fashion collection.'

Myleene, who was born in Norfolk, has two daughters with her estranged husband, four-year-old Ava Bailey and Hero Harper, one.
