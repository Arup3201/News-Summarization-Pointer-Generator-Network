The scourge of cold calling is facing its biggest ever crackdown under plans being drawn up by ministers.

Companies that blitz households with telephone calls and spam text messages face heavy fines of up to 20 per cent their annual turnover.

The move will come as a particular relief to millions who are bombarded every day with offers of Payment Protection Insurance compensation.

As part of the plan, PPI firms which use 'information gathered from unsolicited calls or texts, and provide bad service or waste time by making spurious and unsubstantiated claims' face stringent punishments.

Currently nuisance calls must cause 'substantial stress' or 'substantial damage' for the Information Commissioner's Office to impose sanctions.

Despite an increase to £500,000 in the maximum fine it can impose, the ICO still received 120,310 complaints about unsolicited marketing calls between April and November last year.

The new rules are expected to lower the threshold required for the watchdog to take action against companies that blitz households with telephone calls and spam text messages.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller said: 'Nuisance calls must stop'

Culture Secretary Maria Miller said: 'Nuisance calls must stop. At best they are an irritation and an unwanted intrusion, at worst they cause real distress and fear, particularly to the elderly or housebound.

'People need to feel safe and secure in their homes. The rules are clear. People have the right to choose not to receive unsolicited marketing calls. We will work to ensure their choice is respected.'

The Ministry of Justice will today launch a consultation on whether firms that break Claims Management Regulation Unit rules should face fines of up to 20 per cent of their annual turnover.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, said: 'The Claims Management Regulator already takes tough action against companies which break the rules, suspending and closing down rogue firms, but now these fines will give us an extra weapon to drive bad behaviour out of the industry.'
