If a 16-year-old can sneak into the World Trade Center, two educated journalists should be able to pull off the same feat.

That was the excuse CNN producer Yon Promrenze, 35, and his 26-year-old cameraman Connor Boals gave police officers before they were arrested for trying to break into the World Trade Center Tuesday.

The two men first tried blatantly walking through a security gate on Vesey and Washington Streets but were stopped by an officer, Port Authoruty spokesman Steve Coleman said.

'If a 16-year-old can get on the site, we should be able to get in as well,' one of them allegedly told the officer.

Collared: CNN producer Yon Pomrenze, 35, and 26-year-old cameraman Connor Boals were arrested Tuesday after trying three times to break into the World Trade Center site

Gap in security: The CNN journalists' attempt to break into the building follows two successful breaches in security: one by a 16-year-old New Jersey resident last week and other by three base jumpers and their lookout last September

Sneaky: Weehawken, New Jersey teen Justin Casquejo, 16, was arrested after successfully making it to the top of One World Trade Center in the middle of the night on March 16

They were referring to 16-year-old Weehawken, New Jersey student Justin Casquejo who was arrested last week after successfully making it past security and to the top of the Freedom Tower in the middle of the night.

They then headed east toward the New Jersey Path Station and Boals twice tried to climb the fence but were again stopped by security.

It was on their third attempt to push through a gate at Vesey and Church streets in front of a security guard that the CNN journalists were finally arrested.

'They were trying to prove a point. I guess they thought anybody could get in,' a law enforcement source told the New York Post.

The two men were arrested, booked and charged with trespassing, obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct.

Port Authority spokesman Joseph Pentangelo told the New York Daily News that the journalists' arrests was 'an incredible waste of police resources'.

According to their LinkedIn profiles, Pomrenze has been at CNN since March 2012 while Boals has worked at the news network since January. Boals is a graduate of the Columbia Journalism School.

A CNN spokesperson says the men were not put on assignment to break into the site.

'They were not asked to sneak onto the WTC site,' a CNN representative told 1010 WINS. 'They were in the surrounding area to do a story about the recent incidents at the WTC and other sites – and the notion that daredevils are being drawn to them.'

Police seized from the men a miniature GoPro video camera, a full-size video camera and a tri-pod.

The small GoPro camera was the same device used by a group of men who filmed a base jump off the tower six months ago.

Captured: Police allegedly seized the GoPro video of the BASE jump during a search of the four men's home last month, and it was not posted online until Monday

Going down: The initial free-fall from the 1,776ft tall One World Trade Center tower is several hundred feet

Jumpers Andrew Rossing, James Brady, Marco Markovich and lookout Kyle Hartwell were officially charged 
for breaking into the property on Tuesday.

Rossing and Brady voluntarily turned themselves into police on Monday.

Following
 their arrest, Brady and Rossing appeared on Good Morning America and 
defended their jump from the 104th Floor, saying they didn't mean for 
the act to be disrespectful.

'We
 were a little bit shocked that they spent that much time and energy 
continuing to pursue something that they knew was not a terroristic 
act,' Rossing said.

'Our 
intent was never for this to go public. We never posted the video 
footage. People didn’t know about it. We kept things quiet. As far as we
 were concerned, no one ever needed to know,' he added.

New
 York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that 'both City Hall and 1 
Police Plaza are concerned about' the recent break-ins.
