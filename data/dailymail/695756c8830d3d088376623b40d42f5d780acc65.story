If you are planning on taking part in any high risk activities today, it might be worth thinking again.

Today is one of the most dangerous days of the year to go to Accident and Emergency.

The first Wednesday of August is known as ‘Black Wednesday’ because it is the day that new junior doctors start work, and others move to different departments.

It is thought that people who are admitted to hospital as an emergency on ‘Black Wednesday’ are six per cent more likely to die than they would have been if they were admitted the previous Wednesday, The Telegraph reports.

The situation is even worse for people who are having heart attacks or strokes – they are eight per cent more likely to die on ‘Black Wednesday’.

In an attempt to reduce the problems caused by the influx of new doctors, the NHS has introduced a ‘shadowing’ scheme which sees junior doctors working with a senior doctor during their first four days on the job.

Trials have suggested that this scheme reduces the number of mistakes made by junior doctors by about 50 per cent.

Dr Jim Rodger, Head of Professional Services at the Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotland, told The Telegraph: ‘It is a difficult transition from medical student to junior doctor. Those graduates starting their working life this week should be aware that their competence and skills may not be complete.

‘They should understand their own limitations and seek help and advice from senior staff.’

It is thought that ‘Black Wednesday’ is particularly dangerous because it falls at a time when many of the more senior doctors are on their summer holidays.

As a result, The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, has urged the NHS to make shifts ‘more flexibly and intelligently designed’ to ensure that there are more senior doctors in hospitals at this time of year.

A Department of Health spokesman told The Telegraph: ‘This year's new medical graduates, who are about to start the Foundation Year 1 training, will be paid to shadow the Foundation Year 1 doctor whose post they will take over, as part of this national, mandatory scheme.’
