West Australian premier Colin Barnett has been labelled 'nasty' and 'ungracious' by state MPs after he said former prime minister Gough Whitlam was not a 'great prime minister'.

Following news this morning that Whitlam had died aged 98, Mr Barnett told a Perth breakfast program that while Whitlam was a transformative leader and a towering figure, his government had ended in chaos.

'He was not able to run a competent government - I don't think anybody could suggest that,' Mr Barnett said.

'He ended up with a government in chaos.

'Thank you Gough!' A tribute left on the steps of Old Parliament House

'It was a very tumultuous time. It was a time of government spending a lot of money and I think there was a fair bit of waste. 

'I don't think Gough should really be remembered as a great prime minister.'  

'I think he changed our thinking and he modernised Australia but a lot of the things that he set out to do didn't really work.' 

'There were grand spending programs that didn't really come off.

'He didn't lead his government well but he certainly painted a big new modern picture for Australia. For that he deserves his place in history,' he said.

'He was physically and literally a towering figure in Australian politics.  

Many state Labor MPs responded furiously. 

Rita Saffioti, the state member for West Swan, tweeted: 'Premier's comments on Gough Whitlam today totally inappropriate and disrespectful. Shows what type of person Barnett is.'

Ben Wyatt, the member for Victoria Park, tweeted: 'As far as I can tell, the only nasty ungracious commentary on the passing of Whitlam is from the Western Australian Premier.' 

Whitlam was lionised by many Federal MPs in tributes today. 

Senior Federal MPs on both sides of the aisle, including Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull, Bill Shorten, Chris Bowen and Tanya Plibersek, praised his character and recounted amusing stories of his leadership. 

Australia mourns the passing of its 21st Prime Minister, the Honourable Edward Gough Whitlam AC QC.

We remember his lifetime of service to Australia in the Royal Australian Air Force, as a parliamentarian, as Prime Minister and as an ambassador.

Gough Whitlam was a giant of his time.

He united the Australian Labor Party, won two elections and seemed, in so many ways, larger than life.

In his own party, he inspired a legion of young people to get involved in public life.

He established diplomatic relations with China and was the first Australian Prime Minister to visit China. China is our largest trading partner. That is an enduring legacy.

Gough Whitlam recognised the journey that our country needed to take with indigenous Australians. The image of soil passing from Gough Whitlam's hand to Vincent Lingiari's is a reminder that all Australians share the same land and the same hopes.

Gough Whitlam's life was inseparable from that of Margaret Whitlam. Margaret Whitlam was a leading light for women of her generation. Together they made a difference to our country.

On this day we honour a life of service to our country.

I have instructed all flags to fly at half-mast today and on the day of Mr Whitlam's State Memorial Service.

Further details on how Australians can honour Mr Whitlam will be announced in coming days in consultation with the Whitlam family.

On behalf of the Australian people, I extend my condolences to the Whitlam family on their loss. 

Sydney shock jock Alan Jones was critical of Whitlam's economic management

But Mr Barnett was not alone in his criticism of the Labor prime minister, who occupied the nation's top job from 1972 until his controversial dismissal in 1975. 

Sydney 2GB talkback radio host Alan Jones described Whitlam as the 'charismatic leader' of the Labor Party and a 'visionary in many ways' but criticised his economic management.

He praised the Whitlams for their 'significant dignity' after they were unceremoniously dismissed from the role in 1975. 

'One of the commendable features of it all is the dignity he and his wife accepted the indignity of being dismissed from office,' he said. 

But he told listeners the former Labor leader did not know much about the economy.

'He did in fact, in many ways damage the Australian economy by its absence of any prime-ministerial control over the direction of the economy,' Jones said.
