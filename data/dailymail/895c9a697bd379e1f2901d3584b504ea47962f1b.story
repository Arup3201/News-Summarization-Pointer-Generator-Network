As Chester and Barnsley battled against each other at the Deva Stadium in a bid to book a place in round three of the FA Cup, Seals boss Steve Burr had a novel idea to inject some energy into his weary troops. 

With the rain pelting down, a packet of Jaffa Cakes were thrown onto the field in a attempt to fuel the ailing Chester players. 

Chester's Gareth Roberts duly picked up the biscuits and began eating them before offering some to players on both sides.

Referee Keith Hill then urged Roberts to cease the impromptu snack break and get on with the match.  

But the Chester management's ploy failed to work as Barnsley criused to 3-0 to book their place in the next round.  

Dale Jennings struck twice while Kane Hemmings another another as the non-leaguers were put to the sword by the League One visitors.
