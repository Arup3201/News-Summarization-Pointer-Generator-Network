Forget posing with your best friend, the coolest selfie to have right now is you - and a quokka.

The cute marsupials, mainly found on Rottnest Island in Western Australia, are one of Australia's most-adored furry creatures and shot to international fame in 2013 when US news site The Huffington Post named them "the happiest animal in the world".

Since then, they have become the most sought after animal to say "cheese" with and the hashtag #quokkaselfie has become a huge hit on Instagram and Twitter with tourists visiting the Land Down Under.

Tourists to Rottnest Island in Western Australia have started the hashtag #quokkaselfie on social media 

Quokkas are second only to cats when it come to the internet's most clickable animal and looking at these pictures, it's clear why. 

The tiny marsupial, which is also known at the short-tailed wallaby, has one of the most animated faces amongst it's animal peers and genuinely seems to love taking a selfie. 

It's face actually lights up and it smiles in a cartoon-like way when a camera is pointed as it's face. 

Unlike some of the more well-known Australian wildlife, such as the boxing kangaroo or the snap-happy crocodile, the quokka is probably the easiest animal to a close-up with and tourists to the beautiful Rottnest Island have been making the most of their good nature.

Many tourists have posted selfies with the furry animals on Instagram and Facebook

The quokkas can easily be spotted enjoying themselves on the island and tourists do not have to travel far to get their prized photo with them. 

Quokkas are also found on Bald Island near Albany and in small populations in the south-west of WA. 

The adorable creatures can weigh anywhere from 2.5kg to 5kg and have a round face and tiny ears that stick up on end.

The balls of fur were once abundant throughout Australia but declined rapidly due to the arrival of the dingo  about 3,500 years ago.

Thankfully today they are showing signs of recovery due to the Department of Parks and Wildlife’s operations.

Quokkas have thick, coarse, grey-brown fur and short, rounded fluffy ears

Experts say that quokkas appear to live in territories with the areas defended by dominant males on Rottnest Island.

Their tails measure 24–31 cm long and they have shorter hind legs than other macropod species.

The tiny animals are very unusual as they are able to survive in an environment virtually devoid of freshwater and they can climb trees.
