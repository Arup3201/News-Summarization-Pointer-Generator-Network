A Texas brewery has launched a 99-pack of beer which is so big it needs at least two people to carry it out of the store.

Austin Beerworks has put the huge box of their Peacemaker beer on sale, which comes in a seven foot long box, for the price of $99.

The box also weighs 82 pounds and consists of three rows of 33 cans.

The 99-pack of Peacemaker beer brewed by Austin Beerworks, and takes two people to carry, which has gone on sale in Texas 

The Austin-based brewery released a light-hearted promotional video for the box, showing two men struggling as they attempt to buy a pack 

The brewery admitted the idea for a 99-pack of beer was at first a joke, but several retailers expressed interest in the packs.

It is thought that they will first be on offer in the Austin area.

Makers say the massive packs are designed so that once it is opened, the beer can be covered in ice.

Michael Graham, co-founder of the Austin-based craft brewery said: 'We made it at first as a joke.

He told CBS: 'We conceived of it just to be silly, but we never thought there would be any real interest from retailers and consumers.

'I guess we underestimated the power of a stupid idea.'

Early sales seem to indicate they have gone down well with customers with the brewery posting on their official Facebook page that they had sold out

The brewers admitted that at first they were joking about making a 99-pack due to its impracticality but they had serious demand for various stores  

The launch of the 99-pack comes with a promotional video, which shows the beer being produced in the brewery and explains that they have decided to create their first multi-pack.

It goes on to say that how they thought about a regular-sized 12 pack, a 29 pack and even a 42 pack, before saying they landed on the perfect size of a 99-pack.

The video then shows two men taking one of the huge packs from a supermarket shelf and then struggling to carry it out of the store and load it into a car.

It then ends with the line: '99 beers for 99 bucks and good luck getting them home, you're going to need to bring a friend.'

The video explains that it is the first multi-pack the company have produced, and at first only thought about making a 12-pack 

They then go to explain that they tried a variety of different size packs before coming to the perfect size of a 99 pack 

The video ends with the line: '99 beers for 99 bucks and good luck getting them home, you're going to need to bring a friend.'

The brewery now have plans to ship around 20 packs of the beer per week.

And early sales seem to indicate they have gone down well with customers with the brewery posting on their official Facebook page that they had sold out.

The wrote: 'Today was a crazy day. Sounds like most of y'all had a good time. Thanks for stalking us from place to place and being nice to us.

For those of y'all that didn't have a good time, we're really sorry. We knew there was no way to get 99-packs to everyone who wanted one, but we could have done a few things better.

'We're going to make more 99-packs for next week and are open to any suggestions about how to do it better next time. You're also free to yell at us and call us dirty names.'
