Brighton bomber Patrick Magee has returned to the city where he planted a bomb that ripped through the Grand Hotel killing five people and injuring another 34.

Magee attended a panel discussion alongside victim's daughter Jo Berry following a screening of the documentary Beyond Right & Wrong at The Old Market in Hove.

The intended target of the 1984 IRA terrorist attack was Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Tory Cabinet, who were staying at the hotel during the Conservative Party conference.

Magee was handed eight life sentences at the Old Bailey in 1986, with a recommendation he serve a minimum of 35 years.

He was released in 1999 under the Good Friday Agreement - having served 13 years for the crime.

The documentary follows the story of Jo Berry, whose father Sir Anthony Berry was killed in the explosion, and her reconciliatory journey with Magee. 

Ms Berry believed it important Magee attended last night's documentary screening.

She said: 'For me, inviting Pat to be there is to show a living example of reconciliation and the power of empathy. It is really important to have him there to demonstrate that.

'Yes, some people will be upset but I think that for peace sometimes you have to take these risks.'

Magee declined to give press interviews ahead of the 30th anniversary of the bombing, but Ms Berry believed he had changed considerably.

'When he planted the bomb he wasn’t seeing human beings. It was a strategy and now he sees human beings and wonderful human beings. It has been about him getting his humanity back. That has changed him, definitely.

'He regards me as a friend. He knows that my dad was a wonderful human being and he knows that some of the qualities I have came from my father and that weighs heavily on him.'

Grand Hotel general manager Andrew Mosley said the commemorations were an opportunity to remind staff of what happened 30 years ago. 

'To reflect on what it must have been like for our colleagues at the time and to remember those who lost their lives, those who were injured, the community in Brighton that was so badly affected, and members of the emergency services who were called to the blast.

'The message we want to send above all else is that we have not forgotten what happened here 30 years ago.'

Patrick Magee stayed at the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the weekend of September 14 to 17, 1984 under the pseudonym Roy Walsh.

He planted the bomb under the bath in his room - number 629.

The device had been fitted with a long-delay timer made from components and a safety device.

It detonated at 2.54am on October 12 when the midsection of the hotel collapsed into the basement.

Margaret Thatcher was still awake at the time working on her conference speech for the next day. Her bedroom and sitting room were not damaged and the Prime Minister and her husband escaped without injury.

They were driven to Brighton police station and she gave an impromptu interview to the BBC where she said the conference would still go ahead.

Five were killed including Tory MP Sir Anthony Berry, North-West area chairman Eric Taylor, Lady Shattock (wife of the western area chairman), Lady Maclean (wife of Sir Donald Maclean) and Roberta Wakeham (wife of the Parliamentary Treasury Secretary).

The IRA claimed responsibility the next day and said it would try again.

On 24 June 1985 following investigations into who had stayed in the room, Patrick Magee was arrested in Glasgow.

Four members of an IRA unit were also imprisoned for involvement in the plot.

Meanwhile, former Tory minister Lord Tebbit has said he can never forgive Magee after his bomb injured him and left his wife paralysed.

The then trade and industry secretary, Lord Tebbit was severely injured in the blast and his wife Margaret was left paralysed from the neck down and needing 24-hour care.

Lord Tebbit, writing in The Sunday Telegraph, said: ‘I am often asked if I can find it in my heart to forgive the creature, Patrick Magee. That is not possible, for Magee has never repented.’

Speaking to BBC News he added: 'One can hope that there’s a particularly hot corner of Hell reserved for him and they can repent in his own time there.'

He continued: ‘Magee is just a low creature and an object of contempt, particularly as he now tries to make something of a living out of talking about it.

‘He was no more than a monkey on an organ grinder's organ.’

For the 83-year-old former RAF pilot, the anniversary was ‘just another day’ as he and his wife live with the injuries they sustained in the attack.

In a statement, David Cameron said the anniversary was a timely reminder of Mrs Thatcher’s words at the time that ‘Britain will never be cowed by terrorists’.

He said: ‘It is a message we repeat today as we face down the threat from violent extremism, whether in the skies over Iraq or on the streets of our towns and cities.

‘As we remember today those killed and injured in Brighton, we must renew our vow that terrorism must never win.'
