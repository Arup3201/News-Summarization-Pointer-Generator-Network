Former neighbours of a father of 22, this week spared jail for drug dealing, have spoken of his lavish lifestyle, impressive cars and raucous late-night parties in a caravan.

Raymond Hull, 58, who has children by 11 women despite only having been married once, appears to have enjoyed the trappings of wealth - BMWs, foreign holidays, and presents for his numerous girlfriends - despite having been out of work for a decade.

Hull, who already had 31 convictions and has been jailed four times, was had his prison sentence suspended this week after asking a judge to let him go so that he could care for his newest child - seven-month-old Barry.

Residents of Wigton, Cumbria, where Hull used to live with ex-girlfriend Vanessa Wright, 32, told the Daily Mirror how he had BMWs and even a speedboat in his driveway, and would post photographs of himself enjoying fry-ups while holidaying abroad.

They also attacked him for holding wild parties in a caravan - described as 'pure madness' - almost forcing his neighbours to move away.

One said: 'It was just awful. There was a caravan, a speedboat and a double decker bus parked in the drive or in the street.

'The place was like ­Piccadilly Circus. We were on the verge of moving out as we couldn’t take any more. It’s nice and quiet here now.'

Estimates for the total cost of Hull's lifestyle - totalling up his unemployment payouts, housing benefits as well as handouts to support his children - suggest that he could have cost the taxpayer more than £1million.

Meanwhile, it emerged that one of his daughters, 23-year-old Rianna, posted a jeering message online where, in poor English, she thanked taxpayers for supporting her life of idleness.

She wrote: 'Jst gta announce that i love every working person in cumbria cz fanx to uze i get to sit on my jeer all day nd help use spend yr wagez ! Yaz no hw t spend it wisely ya jenerous f***z xxxxx.'

But despite his record - and the fact that he seems unable to name all his children - Hull last night insisted that he is 'a great dad'.

Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'People might have a pop at me but I love my kids. I can't help it if I'm so fertile and it's not my fault I can't work.

'I keep in touch with as many of my kids as I can and they come round for dinner every week - I'm a great dad — all my kids will tell you that.'

When asked by reporters to list all of his children, Hull could only manage 15 - and says that the remaining seven do not know he is their father.

After his court hearing this week, Hull, who has been married only once insisted ‘I just love kids’, but admitted he was in contact with only ‘about 12’ of them.

Despite police finding a stash of cannabis and text messages from customers, a judge accepted he was helping to raise child number 22 while his partner returned to work.

With ‘considerable hesitation’ the judge went on to impose a suspended sentence.

Afterwards
 Hull – who has a series of convictions dating back four decades – 
defended his unconventional lifestyle, saying he had ‘never been short 
of offers’.

‘I just love kids,’ he said. ‘I don’t regret anything, 
even though I don’t speak to them all. Some of them don’t even know I’m 
their dad.’ And he bragged: ‘I don’t know what it is about me, but I’m 
never short of offers.

‘It’s just my luck that every time I have a one-night stand, the girl ends up getting pregnant.

'I've never had to chase after women. I'm easy going, they are always chasing me.'If it's tidy, you don't knock it back, do you?'

‘I only know one or 
two of their birthdays, but they don’t mind. One of the girls got a 
sister for her birthday one year,’ he recalled yesterday.

The couple
 split up and Hull is listed as the father of three children – Leon, now
 23, Rianna, 22, and Kane, 20 – by his next partner.

Two years ago he
 set up home in the Cumbrian village of Aspatria with a bakery worker 
less than half his age, 26-year-old Emma McNeil, and last year she gave 
birth to a baby boy, Barry. However, when he appeared in court this week
 he claimed to have fathered a total of 22 children.

Explaining how 
he fathered so many children by so many women, he said yesterday: ‘I’ve 
only been married once. I’ve got five kids with one woman; three with 
another; three with another; and three with another. I’ve got two kids 
with one woman and little Barry with Emma.

When asked by The Sun to name all of his children, Hull made it up to 15 before stopping.

He added that the remaining seven do not know he is their father.

They are:

Naomi, 39, Michael, 39, Raymond, 38, Joseph, 36, AdrIan, 34, Rebecca MarIe, 29, Leon, 23, Rianna, 22, Kane, 20, Callum, 10, CaItlyn, 9, Connor, 16, Reece, 16, Abbie, 14, and Barry, seven months.

Seven more were not named.

‘The others were just one each with different women.

'Some of the girls were happy to give the
 relationship a go, others did not want anything to do with me after 
they got pregnant. I still keep in touch with all the women now though. I
 get on better with them now we've split.

'I
 agreed with some of my exes now that if they get married to someone 
else, and another man raises the kid, it is not my kid anymore. I see 14
 of my kids who know I am their dad all the time'.

Hull hasn’t worked for ten years because of a bad back and says 'it must be from running round after all these kids all these years'.

A picture of Hull was once placed on Facebook of him clutching a condom and smiling, and his son Raymond Jr posted: 'You wanna learn how to use them.'

Carlisle Crown Court, where a judge decided to suspend Hull's jail sentence so he could look after his youngest child

He
 claimed to be in debt – but his baby son was playing with an iPad when a
 reporter visited this week. Hull, who also claims to have 19 
grandchildren, was arrested after police raided his terraced home last 
May and discovered cannabis worth £350.

Examination of his mobile 
phone revealed a text message telling a customer there would be a delay 
in supplying drugs due to Barry’s impending birth.

Hull admitted 
using cannabis to help with his own medical problems at Carlisle Crown 
Court, but claimed he only sold to friends to cover costs. However, 
Judge Paul Batty QC dismissed Hull’s claims as a ‘cock and bull story’. 
Hull then abandoned his story, choosing not to give evidence in support 
of it.

In mitigation, Anthony Wilson said Hull had ‘a number of 
medicinal conditions’ including breathing problems, back pains and 
frequent chest infections which would make any time in prison difficult.

He suggested that a suspended sentence could be imposed so that Hull 
could stay at home and look after the baby while his partner went back 
to work.

Judge Batty imposed an 18-month sentence, suspended for two 
years. He also put Hull under a night-time curfew for the next six 
months and ordered him pay £200 which will be taken out of his benefits.

Hull had 31 previous convictions spread over 40 years, but none was for drug dealing.
