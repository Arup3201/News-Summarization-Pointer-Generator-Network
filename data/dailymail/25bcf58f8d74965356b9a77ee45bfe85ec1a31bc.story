Team news

Newcastle

Central defender Mike Williamson returns to the Newcastle squad for Saturday's home Barclays Premier League clash with Crystal Palace.

Williamson missed the 1-0 Capital One Cup second round victory at Gillingham through suspension after being sent off for two bookable offences at Aston Villa last weekend, but is available once again.

However, fellow defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa (ankle) and midfielder Cheick Tiote (hamstring) are still missing, as are full-back Davide Santon and striker Papiss Cisse (both knee).

Provisional squad: Krul, Elliot, Janmaat, Dummett, Haidara, Coloccini, Williamson, S. Taylor, Anita, Abeid, Gouffran, Sissoko, Colback, Cabella, De Jong, Obertan, Aarons, Riviere, Ferreyra, Perez, Armstrong.

Crystal Palace 

Scott Dann remains doubtful for Crystal Palace's Premier League trip to Newcastle on Saturday.

The former Blackburn defender is still battling a niggling hip problem, while Wilfried Zaha could jump straight into action after rejoining Palace on loan.

Light at the end of the tunnel: Joe Ledley (right) is two weeks away from overcoming groin strain

New Eagles manager Neil Warnock will definitely be without midfielder Joe Ledley, who could still be two weeks from overcoming his groin strain.

Provisional squad: Speroni, Hennessey, Mariappa, Ward, Delaney, McCarthy, Dann, Hangeland, Jedinak, O'Keefe, Bannan, Zaha, Garvan, Williams, Guedioura, Bolasie, Thomas, Puncheon, Kebe, Gayle, Murray, Campbell, Chamakh.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Newcastle have won each of their last four league games against Crystal Palace, keeping a clean sheet in each match.

The Eagles have conceded in second-half stoppage time on each of their last two trips to St James Park.

Newcastle scored a goal in the closing five minutes in both games against Palace last season.

Newcastle United are one of only two teams yet to score this season, along with QPR.

Palace enforcer Mile Jedinak made more tackles (133) than any other player last season and already leads the way in 2014-15 with 15.

Late show: Papiss Cisse (left) scored in the final minute to give Newcastle a 1-0 win and their fourth straight victory over Crystal Palace back in March

The Magpies have failed to score in seven of their last 10 Premier League games.

Crystal Palace have won just two points from their last five Premier League games (D2 L3), this after winning 15 out of 15 in their previous five.

Newcastle have scored only 14 Premier League goals in 2014, fewer than any other ever-present side.

Since the start of last season, no team has picked up more red cards in the Premier League than the Magpies (7 – level with Sunderland).

Crystal Palace have conceded two or more goals in each of their last five Premier League matches.
