Stan is a model patient who never complains, despite having copious cuts and bruises and having suffered strokes, lung cancer and even the deadly virus Ebola.

He puts up with being poked and prodded by hundreds of students seeking to find out what's wrong with him.

But then Stan isn't your average sick person. He's a 'human patient simulator' who can be programmed to display symptoms from a variety of maladies.

Stan can be used in a series of real-life scenarios that medical students can expect to encounter as doctors

Robot patient 'Stan' is worked on by anesthetist Dr Donna Fraser at the Scottish Clinical Simulation Centre. Stan's lungs physically consume oxygen and produce CO2

Stan's the man: The high-tech mannequin has numerous functions

The sophisticated robot breathes (he takes in oxygen and expels carbon dioxide), has a pulse, and an arm that can receive an IV.

He can also have blood pressure readings taken and has reactive eyes that dilate in response to light. His vital signs appear on a real clinical monitor and change in accordance to treatment.

Most importantly, he can be controlled by computer to react to various treatments second by second.

For instance, he can respond to procedures such as CPR, intravenous medication and ventilation.

In this way, Stan gives medical students valuable insight into handling real-life scenarios and crucially, if they make a mistake, nobody dies.

Stan, made from hard and soft rubberised plastic, takes pride of place at the newly-opened Scottish Clinical Simulation Centre. Underneath the casing, heÂ  consists of various wires, motors, tubes, hoses, speakers and computer chips.

Anaesthetist Dr Donna Fraser, said the centre based at Forth Valley Royal Hospital in Larbert would provide useful practical experience for students.

'Learning from a text book is very different from having equipment in your hand, people talking to you and machines making noises,' she said.

Stan is just one of a family of seven
hi-tech dummies, developed by CAE Healthcare. His robot relations 
include Reg who can describe his symptoms and give blood and will be used to train emergency doctors and nurses. There is also a pregnant 
woman, two child models and a baby.

Weighing
16lbs, BabySim is an infant simulator with eyes that blink, pupils that
dilate, cooing, crying, tearing and secretions from the ears, eyes and 
mouth. It can also produce heart, bowel and breath sounds and movements.
The rubbery model allows for blocked airways and can be used for safe practice of needle decompression and chest tube insertion.

Scottish
Health Secretary Alex Neil, who visited the centre this week, said: 
'Stan, Reg and the rest of the family are brilliant. Reg was even able 
to tell me how he was feeling - we had a good chat and I am glad to hear
the students here are treating him well.'

Around 1,000 doctors and medical staff will be trained each year using the mannequins.

Dr Michael Moneypenny, director of the centre, said the facility was aimed at improving patient safety.

'Feedback from course participants has been extremely positive, with staff reporting that they feel more confident and skilled in how they apply their knowledge, particularly in managing medical emergencies, which ultimately benefits patients,' he said.
