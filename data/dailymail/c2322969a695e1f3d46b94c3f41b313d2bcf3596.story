Italian media widely reported that the seven-times European champions had sold the vehicle for £115,000 and hoped to save £153,000  per year.

One Twitter user posted a photo-shopped picture of the Milan players standing by the side of a motorway behind chief executive Adriano Galliani, who was holding a sign which read 'Roma'

Serie A has fallen behind Europe's other top leagues in financial terms and, like many Italian clubs, Milan, who have not officially commented on the bus, have been forced to cut costs over the last few seasons.

They finished eighth in Serie A in 2013-14, missing out on European football, and are currently eighth at the halfway point in this season's campaign.
