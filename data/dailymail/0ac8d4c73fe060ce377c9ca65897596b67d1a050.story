Arsenal could be set to miss out on signing Tolgay Arslan, who is close to agreeing terms with Besiktas.

The Hamburg defensive midfielder and his representatives are waiting on a decision from Arsene Wenger before finalising terms with the Turkish club.

Wenger has been monitoring the player, who is available for free in the summer but can discuss pre-contract terms with clubs outside of the Bundesliga now.

Arsenal could be set to miss out on signing Tolgay Arslan, who is close to agreeing terms with Besiktas

He is out of contract in the summer and can agree pre-contract terms with non-German clubs this window

The 24-year-old is seeking wages of £40,000-per-week and is tempted by the offer on the table from Besiktas.

Wenger is short in central midfield with Mikel Arteta and Jack Wilshere out injured.

The Frenchman has suggested he is pursuing defensive options in this transfer window and has admitted his interest in Ipswich's Tyrone Mings.

Arslan, whose contract ends on June 30 this year, is keen for a new challenge and would welcome a move away from Germany.

His parents are from Turkey, although he was was born and grew up in Paderborn.

Arslan has represented Turkey's Under 19 and 21 sides but has more recently played for Germany's Under 20s and 21s.

Arsenal have been keeping tabs on Arslan's situation since November.

He is a hard worker in front of the back four and plays a short passing game, meaning he would fit in to Wenger's style of play. 

Ipswich Town defender Tyrone Mings has also been attracting interest from Arsenal in recent weeks
