While ex-CBS news anchor Rob Morrison was pleading with a judge in Connecticut court this week, his estranged wife Ashley was lounging by the pool enjoying her new life in Florida

Morrison was in court on Tuesday after he was arrested for violating a protective order taken out by his wife by calling her more than 120 times over Memorial Day weekend.

Ashley has since moved to Florida, taking their 9-year-old son with her, and she was pictured enjoying the hot weather and working on her tan while her husband was making his case in court.

New life: 'Jack and I will be spending a lot of our time relaxing, haning out in the pool and getting our new house set up, until I go back to work in a couple of weeks,' Ashely wrote

'I have relocated and I am happy to now call Florida home!!' Ashley wrote.

'Jack
 and I will be spending a lot of our time relaxing, hanging out in the 
pool and getting our new house set up, until I go back to work in a 
couple of weeks!!'

It's unclear what Ashley's new job is.

Meanwhile, Rob Morrison was defending his excessive calling to a judge, saying he was just trying to be a good dad.

'I want the system to start working 
for me,' Morrison complained in Stamford Superior Court. 'I'm a great 
dad who deserves to spend time with his son and it shouldn't be at the 
whim. It's not capricious.'

His attorney Frank DiScala says Morrison has a daily 5pm FaceTime call with his son that isn't being kept.

'The
 reason why we're here is he wants to see his son,' DiScala told Judge 
Thomas Colin. 'I'm asking he be permitted to call his wife's phone once a
 day.'

The judge will address that custody issue back in court on August 19.

Estranged wife Ashley Morrison says she didn't mean to get her husband arrested when she reported him to police. Her husband says he was just trying to talk to their son

Morrison was arrested on June 16,
 after his wife complained to police about the calls. She 
told authorities she just wanted to clarify her protective order and 
didn't intend to have her husband arrested.

However, officers say she was 'physically shaking' when she came into the police station, and was in a 'very fragile state'.

She told officers she feared her husband 'could kill her if she got him arrested'.

He is currently free on $50,000 bond and say he only called to contact their 9-year-old son.
