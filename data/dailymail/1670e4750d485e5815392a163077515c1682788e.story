A married father is being mourned by the yachting community after he was killed when his stricken boat broke apart in rough seas during a race on Friday.

Craig Williams, 36, was found unresponsive in the water by the coast guard after his six-strong crew sent a mayday call as their boat, the Uncontrollable Urge, drifted in rough seas toward a rocky island shore off southern California.

Friends said on Monday that Mr Williams had died doing what he loved. The architect from Serra Mesa has a two-year-old daughter Claire and was looking forward to the birth of his second child this summer with wife Kjersti.

Chuck Hope of the San Diego Yacht Club told NBC: 'These guys take their sport very seriously and there are risks involved and they donâ€™t take losing a sailor lightly.'

The
crew of Uncontrollable Urge radioed the mayday call after the 32-foot sailboat lost its steering capability. The boat was buffeted by eight foot waves and wind gusts of 20 to 30 knots.

The craft began drifting toward San Clemente Island, where it then broke apart, Coast Guard Petty Officer Connie Gawrelli said.

The
crew originally activated a feature on the boat to provide authorities 
their GPS coordinates and other crucial information, but declined 
assistance and requested a tow boat, she said.

However, stormy ocean conditions kept the tow boat from getting to them.

One of the organizers of the two-day 
Islands Race said the crew encountered more bad luck when attempts to 
deploy a life raft and anchor the boat failed. The crew abandoned ship 
when the boat entered the surf line and broke apart.

The coastguard caught the dramatic rescue using night-vision goggles and infrared camera, which help find those in the water.

Mr Williams and five other crew 
members were hoisted into a helicopter and flown to hospital.They were treated and later released.

The 36-year-old 
was a member of the Silver Gate Yacht Club in San Diego, where the 
Uncontrollable Urge is docked, its commodore said.

'This
is a very difficult time for the Williams family, the skipper of 
Uncontrollable Urge and the other surviving crew members,' commodore Carey Storm 
said.

'[The club] and 
the entire Southern California racing community is a close family, and 
the loss of one of our members impacts us all greatly.'

The yacht club has set up a fundraising site to raise money for Mr Williams' two young children.

The Islands Race website listed James Gilmore as the owner of the Uncontrollable Urge. Gilmore tweeted on Friday that he was taking the new boat on its first race, and noted that the forecast called for 25-knot winds.

'Gonna see what this boat can do!' he posted.

Chuck Hope said the Uncontrollable Urge was known within the sailboat racing circuit and that its crew and skipper were experienced.

He said stormy conditions in the open seas caused equipment failures for two other boats, forcing their crews to drop from the race. The Uncontrollable Urge crew radioed that the boat's rudder failed.

The overnight, 139-nautical-mile race began in Newport Harbor in Orange County on Friday and was to take participants around Catalina and San Clemente islands before finishing off in San Diego's Point Loma.
