It has been revealed over the past two days that Canadian gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was a career criminal and drug addict, but it seems that was not the case just a few short years ago.

In his high school yearbook photo from 2000, taken while he was a senior at Ecole Secondaire Saint Maxime in Laval, Quebec, the teenager is seen smiling and happy.

In fact, it seems he was both personable and popular judging but what his fellow students said about the young man.

Schhol: These comments were made when Zehaf-Bibeau was a senior at Ecole Secondaire Saint Maxime (above) in Laval, Quebec

'Mike is a sociable and intelligent guy,' wrote on his friends in the yearbook, obtained by the National Post.

'He loves to laugh, and his smile wins over the girls.'

They then added, 'He will go far in life.' 

Zehaf-Bibeau did not go far however, and shortly after graduating was arrested for the first time, convicted of possessing a false credit card and impaired driving at the age of 19 in 2001.

From there, numerous drug arrests followed, as well as ones for robbery and a weapons charge.

Soon he was homeless, living in shelters, and he eventually converted to Islam.

Not far: A little over 10 years after he was described as smiling and personable, Zehaf-Bibeau killed a man and opened fire on Parliament

Even then, with the religion's strict stance on drugs, he would continue to fall back into his addictions, so bad that in 2011 he actually begged a judge to put him in jail so he could kick crack and become clean. 

Soon, his mosque even asked him to leave, after he began sleeping there without permission.

Then, on Wednesday, the 32-year-old killed a young solider, Corporal Nathan Cirillo, as he stood guard at the National War Memorial, before opening fire on Parliament.

He injured three more before he was eventually shot dead.
