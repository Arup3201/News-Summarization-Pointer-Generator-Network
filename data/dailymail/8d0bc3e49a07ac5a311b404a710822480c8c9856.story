A father and his 15-year-old son who died while cave diving on Christmas Day had run out of air while descending to dangerous depths, investigators have said.

The bodies of Daren Spivey, 35, and his son Dillon Sanchez were found hours after they went diving at the Eagle Nest Sink cave in Hernando County, Florida last December.

A sheriff's office investigation has found that pair died accidentally after apparently losing track of time and diving to 233 feet while using just air in their tanks.

Tragic: Darrin Spivey, 35, and his 15-year-old son Dillon Sanchez were found dead following a cave dive last December after they lost track of time and ran out of air, authorities concluded

The depth meant that the duo - who were not certified in cave diving -
should have used a trimix combination for their breathing instead of 
just air, rescue diver Eric Deister told the Tampa Tribune.

He added that they shouldn't have gone deeper than 218 feet due 
to possible toxic effects.

Rescuers found Spivey's body floating 120 feet below the surface with his breathing device out of his mouth - an indication that he had perhaps tried to give his son air after the teenager ran out.

Rescue divers added in the report that they believe the boy then panicked and attempted to swim to the 
surface because he did not have his mouthpiece intact and his mask was 
around his neck.

Unprepared: The duo, who were trying out new equipment, were not certified to dive in caves

The teenager's body was found 67 feet below the surface.

Divers found the duo's tanks had run out of air and their light sources had run out of battery.

The father and son had left home at 7am to test out new diving equipment at Buford Spring, but found that it was flooded so headed to Eagles Nest Sink, arriving at around 11am.

Spivey's fiancee Holly King started to worry when the two didn't return
 and she couldn't get through to Spivey on his cell phone. She called law enforcement around 3pm.

She finally drove out there herself 
and found their car was still parked in the lot, and then began calling family members.

Danger: They were diving at the Eagle Nest Sink cave in Hernando County, Florida

Cave: Authorities said Dillon, right, and his father had the right equipment but not the right training

Recovery
 divers started searching the waters an hour later and found both bodies
 in the main cavern area between 9pm and 10pm.

Divers concluded that the men had the proper equipment to dive, but they did not have the experience. Spivey only had a certification for open water diving, and his son had no certification.

Eagle Nest Sink does not check diver certifications.

On the approach to Eagles Nest Sink, there are warning signs that tell just how dangerous the diving there is.

Diving site Aquaviews.net has named the Floirida cave as 'one of the top three extreme dives in the world'.

Warning: There are signs at the cave warning people against diving unless they are certified

'Only
 for highly experienced cave divers and the technically sound, the 
descent of Eagle's nest is similar to that of a chimney and hundreds of 
feet below it opens up into a large cavern called "the Main Ballroom", 
beyond which are longer tunnels and crannies that go even deeper,' the 
website said.

Multiple divers have perished attempting the descent into Eagles Nest Sink over the past 20 years.
