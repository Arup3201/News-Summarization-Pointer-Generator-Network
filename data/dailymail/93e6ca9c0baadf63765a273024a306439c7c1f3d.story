Officials say two young siblings ages one and six are dead after a violent house fire in New Jersey.

The Essex County prosecutor's office says the children, who were trapped on the third floor, were found inside the home in Orange after the blaze broke out on Friday night.

Seven other occupants escaped, including two children whom witnesses said jumped to safety into the arms of a passerby.

Dead:  Jayda McEachin, 6, and Zion Tony, 1, were killed in a house fire in New Jersey on Friday night 

Engulfed in flames: This New Jersey home was in flames on Friday night and fire fighters had a tough time quelling the fire due to the frigid cold outside 

Officials identified the children as Zion Tony, 1, and his older sister, Jayda McEachin, 6.

Two other people were treated at a hospital.

Resident Mary Lewter tells NJ.com she was woken up by her baby's father who urged her to get out of the burning building. She says she tried to go upstairs and help others but was blocked by flames.

Lewter, who lives on the ground floor of the home, told NJ Advance Media on Friday that she was woken up by her baby's father, who told her to take the child out of the building.

Lewter, a cousin to the two children killed in the blaze, said she tried to go upstairs to help her relatives but was hindered by flames and smoke.

Firefighters would not allow her to re-enter the home. 

Passerby Darryl Mayfield says he caught the two kids who jumped from a top window to the porch roof and survived.

'We see smoke coming from the front. We ran down, we looked up — there was two kids up there, and they was waving. So we were like, ‘Yo, jump!’ Now man, they didn’t jump,' Mayfield told CBS.

Firefighters work to put out a house fire on Friday night that killed two young children who were trapped inside

'But the little sister, she threw her brother out. The girl threw the brother out and we caught him.'

The home was fully in flames when firefighters arrived and they had a hard time fighting the fire because of the cold weather.

'Our firefighters are out here. We’ve called neighboring towns as well. It’s particularly tough when you have frozen pipes, and the water freezes basically on impact, and so it’s good that we have a rotation of firefighters going in and out of the unit,' Mayor Warren said.

'It’s actually still flaming, and it’s been doing this for two hours now. So this is serious.'

The cause of the blaze is still unknown.
