Adnan Januzaj has surprised a young Manchester United fan by giving him a new replica home shirt to replace the one printed with his old squad number.

James Collins was heartbroken after saving up his birthday money to spend almost £100 on his favourite player's shirt earlier this summer, only for the Belgian midfielder to change his squad number a month later. 

Despite not informing the supporters of the planned change until Sunday August 17 - exactly a month since the shirt had been released - the club superstore then refused to change the shirt with Januzaj's old number 44 on free of charge, for his new one number 11, previously worn by now-retired Ryan Giggs.

James had initially spent months waiting to get his hands on the new Januzaj kit before he changed his number

Adnan Januzaj joined the club at 16 in 2011 and played under the number 44 until this summer

Young fan James had refused to wear the Nike strip, which cost him £93.20 in total, fearing he may be teased about it.

But it appears a dramatic u-turn has arisen with Januzaj delighting James with a new shirt with his new number on.
