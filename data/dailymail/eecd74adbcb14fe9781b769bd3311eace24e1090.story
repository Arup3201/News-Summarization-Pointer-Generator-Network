Despite the condition not officially being recognised until the 19th century, cases of Down’s syndrome have existed throughout human history.

References in archaeological records are extremely rare, but researchers from France believe they have found a child's skull showing the earliest signs of the disorder dating back to the 5th century.

The body of the child was also found buried in the same position and location as others in the necropolis - and archaeologists believe this means the five- to seven-year-old wouldn't have been stigmatised or treated any differently when they were alive.

The body of a five- to seven-year-old (pictured left) was found in a 5th century necropolis in Saint-Jean-des-Vignes. Researchers used CT scans to examine the skull (pictured right), and this revealed features including a flattened occiput at the back of the skull and tooth inflammation that are consistent with Down's syndrome

The remains were found by archaeologists from the University of Bordeaux in a necropolis that dates back to the 5th century. The sex of the child is unknown.

They were placed in the grounds of a church in Saint-Jean-des-Vignes in Eastern France. 

Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder that delays a person's growth and causes intellectual disability. 

People
 with Down's syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21, rather than 
two.

The condition was first detailed by English physician John Langdon Down in 
1862. 

He later characterised it as a mental disability in a widely published report in 1866.

Despite
 the lack of evidence in archaeological records, a number of historical 
artwork is believed to portray Down's syndrome including the 16th century
 painting The Adoration of the Christ Child.

This latest case represents the earliest and youngest example of the condition in the archaeological record.

Prior
 to this, a possible case in a 9-year-old child from England, dating 
back to 700 to 900, was found with a selection of consistent features.

Using a combination of morphological and radiographic techniques, metrical data and scans, the skull of the child was compared with those belonging to people of similar age and location. 

They found the skull exhibited signs of brachycrany and metopism, in which the skull is short and broad with a disfigurement of the forehead.

There was also evidence that the rear of the skull was flattened, and the teeth were inflamed. 

This combination of features is consistent with modern-day diagnoses of Down’s syndrome.

Although less diagnostic, but important when taken in combination with the other features, the researchers also noted an absence of the frontal sinuses, a small face, low and thin mandibular ramus - jawbone running below each ear - and dental defects.

According to the archaeologists, cases of Down’s syndrome in past populations are rare, frequently poorly described or discovered out of context. 

This case, therefore, represents the earliest and youngest example of the condition in the archaeological record.

The necropolis was in the grounds of a church in Saint-Jean-des-Vignes (pictured). The child was on its back, facing east to west. Other bodies discovered in the necropolis were found in the same position, suggesting the child's burial was no different - and archaeologists believe this means the infant wasn't stigmatised

Prior to this, a possible case in a nine-year-old child from England, dating back to 700 to 900 AD was found with a selection of these features.

Elsewhere,
 Professor Maïté Rivollat and his colleagues at the university also 
noted that the context and funerary treatment of the child suggests that
 they were was not stigmatised by other members of the community.

For example, the child was placed on its back in the tomb, facing from east to west, with the head at the westward end.

According to archaeologists, cases of Down's syndrome in past populations are rare, and this latest case is the earliest on record. Despite the lack of evidence in archaeological records, a number of artwork is believed to portray Down's syndrome, including the 16th century painting The Adoration of the Christ Child (pictured)

Other 
bodies discovered in the necropolis were found in the same position, 
suggesting that the child’s burial was no different – and archaeologists
 believe this meant the infant wouldn’t have been treated any 
differently when they were alive. 

The cause of death, however, is unknown.

‘The results of our [study] lead us to conclude that the Saint-Jean-des-Vignes cranial skeleton reflects an individual who suffered from Down syndrome.

‘To our knowledge, this child represents the earliest and youngest case of this pathology.

‘It should be emphasised that, unlike previous published cases, the archaeological context is well known here, and provides evidence that this child was treated like the healthy members of the community.’

Skull of the five to seven-year-old child was found in 5th century necropolis

CT scans were used to examine the unknown child's skull shape

It revealed features including a flattened rear, and tooth inflammation

Combination of features are consistent with diagnosis of Down’s syndrome

The child was also buried in the same way as others in the necropolis

This suggests the child was not stigmatised by members of the community

Down’s syndrome was described in 19th century and older cases are rare

Researchers claim this case is the earliest in archaeological record
