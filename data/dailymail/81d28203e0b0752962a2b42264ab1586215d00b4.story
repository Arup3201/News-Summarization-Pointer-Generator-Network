A pregnant Australian mother-of-two facing deportation from Yorkshire despite having a British husband has won her battle to stay in the UK.

Katherine Tate, 23, was told that she must return to Australia by immigration authorities, even though her husband Dale, and children Oliver and Harrison are British citizens.

But after an Immigration Tribunal ruled in their favour, the Home Office dropped its case against the family from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, saving the family from fighting a costly appeal.

Dale Tate is battling to prevent his wife Katherine from being deported despite their two sons Oliver, left and Harrison, right being British citizens. The Home Office wants to send Mrs Tate back to Australia 

Someone can apply for British citizenship if they are married to a UK national once they are more than 18, of sound mind and good character.

Applicants need to have a knowledge of English and an understanding of life in this country.

Applicants must have lived in the UK for the past three years and spent no more than 270 days outside the country during that time - including no more than 90 days in the past 12 months.

Also applicants must not have broken any immigration rules.

The department had previously argued Mrs Tate and her husband should have completed the required paperwork before they flew from Australia to the UK. 

Mr Tate, 30, who grew up in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, is angry with the Home Office's stance. 

He said: 'My wife is an Australian citizen, our two children are British citizens, and she is six months pregnant with our third child.

'I own an electrical contracting company and employ two tradesmen and two apprentices in turn creating jobs, skills and a contribution to our economy and welfare system.

'We claim no benefits whatsoever, no child support, no family tax credits or others alike.

'We pay our taxes and NHS stamp regularly and work hard but for some reason, the Home Office have deemed us to be unsuitable to live here in the UK and have attempted to deport my wife whilst pregnant to a country where she no longer has any support, no job, no home and no family.'

Mr Tate, right, said: 'I'm not a rich man and every penny I earn is for my family. It annoys us that there are so many people claiming benefits yet we could be split up as a family'

Before the Home Office's decision to back down, he spoke of his 'desperate legal battle which is costing us thousands of pounds that we should be using to look after our home and our family'.

Mr Tate met his wife in Australia's Whitsunday Islands in 2010 while he was travelling and they married on October 1, 2011.

They have two sons, Oliver, 3, and Harrison, 18-months, who were both born in Australia but as British citizens.

Their third child, also a boy, is due in December.

Mr Tate said: 'We had no problems in returning to the UK to resume our family life here last July and applied in September for all the permissions we thought we needed.

'The Home Office got very strict and insisted that Katherine leave the country within 10 days or would be forcibly removed. We instructed a lawyer and so began a very costly process.

'We finally got them to a tribunal in Manchester and the judge ruled in our favour last month.

'To make things worse, they have also instructed the NHS not to give my wife any pregnancy care or treatment without payment for these services.

'I'm not a rich man and every penny I earn is for my family. It annoys us that there are so many people here claiming benefits yet we could be split up as a family'.'

Mrs Tate said: 'I'm pregnant without third child who is due in December and I've been told by the Home Office that if I need any NHS treatment I will have to pay.

'Dale was born in this country and he owns an electrical contracting company where he employs two tradesmen and apprentices.

'We don't claim any kind of benefits, or receive family tax credits, child support or anything else like that.

'But for some crazy reason the Home Office don't think we should be allowed to live here.

'We've already been through the court system where the judge actually ruled in our favour.

'Surely common sense should have prevailed but obviously that isn't going to be the case.

'It's costing us an awful lot of money and with our third child on the way it is money we can't afford.

'I'm an Australian citizen but I'm married to Dale, who is British citizen and my two boys are both British citizens too.

The couple first met in Australia in 2009 before getting married in 2011.

'We applied for all permissions we thought we needed as soon as we arrived in the UK last summer.

'But after the Home Office contacted us in January this year we had no choice but to contact a lawyer and start what has become a very expensive process.

'We're absolutely devastated because we're a hard-working family who face being split up.' 

The Home Office claimed that the Tate family should have completed the proper paperwork before returning to the UK. Mrs Tate faces deportation even though her husband was born in Yorkshire 

Colne Valley MP Jason McCartney had taken up the couple's case and wrote a letter of support for them to the tribunal.

He insists the immigration system needs a rapid overhaul and needs to be simplified.

'There are hundreds of thousands of cases caught up in the backlog. The Tates are genuinely worried and we have been fighting their case since February.

'I hope we can get a decisions sooner rather than later'.

A Home Office spokesperson confirmed today they would not appeal against the ruling.
