After spending 47 years chasing criminals across London, Britain's longest serving policeman has hung up his helmet.  

PC Robert Brown joined the Metropolitan Police at the age of 19 in 1968, when officers relished in their £855 annual salaries and marvelled at the recent technological development of personal radios.

Some five decades later and having been involved in some of the city's most notorious crimes, the 64-year-old has retired. 

At a moving ceremony in Croydon today PC Brown shook the hand of more than 100 officers who had turned out to bid him farewell.

He arrived at the honour guard in a vintage Morris panda car - used by officers in 1968 - and accompanied by two of the Met's white Sovereign Escort horses.

Asked what advice he would give today's force, he smiled: 'It's all about people, about their problems, and you try and just help them the best you can.' 

Born in Croydon in 1950, PC Brown was among the first batch of officers to operate under the New Theft Act, still in use today.

He spent 13 weeks at the Met's training centre in Hendon before serving at stations in Brent, Norbury, Addington an Sutton. In the late 1990s, he joined the Croydon branch, where he carried out his last day's work to rapturous applause today.

Speaking of his commitment to the job, Mr Brown said humbly: 'I always wanted to do something like public service, looking after people.  

'And that is what it basically is. Sometimes it's arresting them but other times it's protecting people, looking after them, and that is what I wanted to do. I have been quite content to do that.'

Reminiscing about his first few years in service, Mr Brown spoke of how much the strains of his job had changed. 

'It was quieter. We didn't always have radios, no panda cars - it was more or less coming on from Dixon Of Dock Green, where you had a whistle, a truncheon, a police box to go into to make calls to the station to say you were safe and pick up your calls from.

'If it was an emergency call they used to flash the light on top to get people to go to the box to answer it - that's what it was all about.

'It was a quieter pace of life. You went out and had a particular beat to do. It actually was checking shop doorways and shops to see they were locked and things like that - that's what you did.'

When PC Brown signed up to join the Metropolitan Police in 1986 as a cadet trainee, a typical salary for an officer of his age was £855 a year. 

While women had been accepted to the force they earned significantly less at £775, working fewer hours than their male peers. 

The first black female police officer joined in the year Mr Brown signed up. Her name was Sislin Fay Allen. 

In 1968, John Waldron was at the helm of the force as commissioner. 

Many expected his role to be temporary following the sudden death of his predecessor Joseph Simpson. 

Waldron in fact served until 1972. 

Most significantly around the year in which Mr Brown joined the force, say historians, is the introduction of new technology. 

'Personal radios had just been introduced which is the biggest, most remarkable thing,' Neil Paterson, Manager at the Metropolitan Police Heritage Centre said. 

'Of course there was the introduction of the New Theft Act which we still use today.' 

Another crucial change in the law was implemented in the case of Fagan vs Metropolitan Police. The trial brought about the introduction of mens rea, latin for 'guilty mind', which denotes a defendant's deliberate intention to cause harm.

Five years after signing up he was involved in the high profile shooting of Jewish businessman and Marks & Spencer boss Joseph Sieff who was killed by Venezuelan terrorist Carlos the Jackal. 

In 1978 he worked alongside a special branch during the arrest of Astrod Proll,  a member of revolutionary terrorists the Baader-Meinhof gang, or the Red Army Faction.

PC Brown was also on duty during the first Brixton riot in 1981, facing bricks, bottles and burning buildings. Aside from a few short breaks he worked for three whole days as he and his fellow officers struggled to keep order.

Perhaps the darkest day of his time in uniform came on February 8 1994, when he and three colleagues responded to an armed robbery at a sub-post office in New Addington.

One of them, Sergeant Derek Robertson, was stabbed. PC Brown gave him first aid and watched on desperately as medics tried to save his life to no avail. 

Of how much the profession has changed since then he added: 'It has had to evolve because society has changed, hasn't it. 

"There's a certain amount of more violence. I think police officers need to be protected more and they are protected more, and the equipment's better than it used to be.

'When I stopped working on the streets I was wearing body armour, I was carrying an asp, I had CS gas and everything else, and that's just been brought about because of the amount of violence we are having to face sometimes.

'It is time to go. My job has run it's course and it's time to go to on to pastures new. I didn't want to stay on any longer and I think I've done what I wanted to do. It's time to do something different.'

Asked what advice he would pass on to the younger generation of officers, Mr Brown said: 'Listen to people, go with the training, don't always assume that something facing you is the whole story, and ask people what's really going on before you make any decisions.

'And just be patient - you have got to have a lot patience, because you are called names, and the names don't really mean anything.

Throughout his 47-year career the officer has been involved in the arrests of high profile murderers and policing of riots 

'It's all about people, about their problems, and you try and just help them the best you can. That's what I've tried to do all my service, and try and remain cheerful and polite.'

Last week the 64-year-old was awarded the Queen's Police Medal at Buckingham Palace, one of the highest honours an officer can achieve. At the ceremony in Croydon today, Chief Superintendent Andy Tarrant, Croydon's borough commander, said: 'For me Bob is the epitome of a good police officer, someone who wanted to serve as long as possible on the front line, and he is an ideal role model to younger serving officers.

'I spoke to an officer recently with 30 years service who dealt with an incident with Bob over the last couple of weeks, and they said they learned something from how Bob dealt with it.

'The fact that Bob could show a really experienced officer how something could be dealt with really pays testament to him.

'We are very proud and we will be sorry to see him go, and I think this police station will be a sadder place because he is retiring.'

Mr Brown now plans to spend more time with family in Yorkshire. Tragically his wife Renee died last year, followed by his son, Lee, who died of pneumonia last month. 

Today his sister and nephew were among those lauding him as a credit to the police force. 

'(The ceremony) is nothing more than he deserves. He wouldn't have wanted all this but it is just amazing. We are immensely proud of him,' said Robert Brown. 

Mrs Brown added: 'I can't find the words, really. Our mother was so proud, and had photos of him on the wall and used to tell people, "that's my Bobby up there."'
