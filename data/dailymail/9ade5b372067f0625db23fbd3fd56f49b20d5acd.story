Tom Ford has opened up for the first time about the birth of his new son, Alexander John Buckley Ford; revealing how fatherhood has turned his world upside down.

Talking to Vogue's André Leon Talley, the designer discusses his new life with six-month-old baby 'Jack,' who was born in September last year with Mr Ford's longtime boyfriend Richard Buckley.

The 51-year-old, who showed  his namesake label's first runway show on February 18, said: 'I feed him in the morning, I change his
diaper, I dress him, I play with him, and I have a good two-to-three 
hours before I go to the office, just me and Jack.

A disbelieving Mr Leon Talley asks: 'You change his diapers?'

Mr Ford responds: 'Of course, all the time,' before adding, 'I didn't have a child because I wanted to hand him off to somebody, I had a child because I've always wanted a child.'

When asked if the diapers are made 'of broadcloth or something,' the designer admits that they are all-natural and biodegradable.

Alexander John ('He has a very long fancy name, but we call him Jack,' says Mr Ford)  is the first child for the couple, who have been together for 25 years.

The couple met when Ford, who took over the reigns at Gucci before launching his own successful company, was just 25 and Mr Buckley, the former Editor in Chief of Vogue Hommes International, was 38.

The baby is believed to have been born 
via a surrogate, the same route taken by Sir Elton John and his partner 
David Furnish, to have their baby son Zachary, who will celebrate his 
second birthday on December 26.

Ford has discussed his desire for children for quite some time, telling Fern Mallis just this year: 'I'd better get busy [with having a baby] soon because I still want to be able to pick them up.'

Filming in his London office, Mr Ford also discussed his latest collection, and whether he’ll ever return to filmmaking.

'I hadn't done a runway collection in a long time and it makes you think in a completely different way,' he reveals. 'There was a bit of street in there, which I liked. But urban, pumped up.'

As for filmmaking (he directed the 2009 thriller, The Single Man, starring Julianne Moore and Colin Firth), he quips: 'My production this year was Jack Ford. The second production was the show,' before teasing, 'And ugh, you know, coming soon.'
