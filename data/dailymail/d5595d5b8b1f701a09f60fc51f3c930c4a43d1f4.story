A cyclist has filmed himself nearly running over dozens of pedestrians in a bid to shame them into improving their awareness of the road.

He claims he posted the footage online for their own good, to help them realise the risks they take while walking around the roads of busy town centres.

However, some observers have claimed that he put the pedestrians in danger himself by cycling too quickly and failing to take account of people as they crossed the street.

Moreover, he refuses to reveal his own identity, using the pseudonym 'Careful Cyclist', even though many of the pedestrians in the video are clearly identifiable.

Danger: An anonymous cyclist has posted a video of pedestrians he believes are being reckless

Rush: Many of those in the film can be seen running to get out of the cyclist's way

Anger: The man says he posted the video to alert pedestrians to the danger they put themselves in

The anonymous man has previously posted videos of wrongdoing by motorists and his fellow cyclists.

In his latest film, posted on YouTube two days ago, he rides around York capturing dozens of near-misses between his bike and pedestrians who do not seem to look where they are going.

Some of the pedestrians are forced to jump out of the cyclist's way, while others ignore him entirely as they walk in the road.

In two cases, mothers pushing buggies start to cross the road before the mysterious cyclist shouts at them to stop and they return to the pavement.

Obstruction: The cyclist says he wants to draw attention to people acting recklessly on the roads

Controversy: Some say he fails to take account of the crowded streets and unpredictable behavior

The man filming apparently loses his temper on a number of occasions, shouting 'silly man' at one pedestrian and wagging his finger at people he believes are misbehaving.

He said today that he has been cycling in York for 30 years, and has become increasingly concerned about pedestrians' behaviour.

His aim is to make pedestrians ask themselves, 'Is the additional risk I am taking worth it?'

In an online blog post, he wrote: 'The video highlights that again a number of road users are not taking the risks of the road seriously.

'Distracted by mobile phones, rushing to get somewhere, ignoring red lights at crossings, or simply not looking when crossing the road, pedestrians often rely on their hearing for warning of vehicles approaching.'

Temper: On some occasions, the unidentified man ends up shouting at pedestrians to stop

Near-miss: The video shows how close the cyclist and pedestrians are to coming to blows

But some fellow cyclists suggested that he was increasing the pedestrians' risk by speeding towards them and refusing to slow down or go around them.

'You need to slow down a bit on approach, you call yourself a careful cyclist but I think you can improve,' wrote 'CycleGaz' on YouTube. 'Don't forget that the green light only means you can go if it is safe to do so - if someone is crossing, even if the man is red, you need to give way to them.'

'The Cycle Ops' added: 'Why don't you slow down for these people when you can see they're in the road? The onus is on you to avoid them.'
