Rare  footage showing the iconic 1970s police patrol car known as the 'Jam Sandwich' in action has been unearthed and shown for the first time.

Rover 3500s, affectionately named because the distinctive orange and white markings resembled jam between two slices of bread, were a familiar sight on Britain's roads.

The slang was popularised on TV shows including 1970s police drama The Sweeney, Minder, Life on Mars starring Philip Glenister as DCI Gene Hunt and Only Fools and Horses.

Del Boy memorably turns to Rodney in one episode after he failed to spot a PC approaching and said: 'You must have been a bit suspicious when a giant jam sandwich pulled up beside you?'

The SD1 model cars, which boasted a powerful V8 engine, could reach speeds of up to 125mph.

Rare promotional footage showing the car being taken for a test drive was released by West Midlands Police today after it was discovered in the force's archive.

In the video, a man is heard saying the car has 'good looks, appeal and style' and that 'criminals would not want to see this in their rear view mirror'.

'It is a highly sophisticated piece of British engineering and manufacturing,' the promotional video states.

'Road users across the West Midlands see the cars as a beacon of authority'. 

A spokesman said: 'With a V8 engine they could achieve speeds of around 125 miles an hour and could easily out pace most other vehicles on the road.

'In fact in the early days the only way an officer could detect a vehicle's speed was to run alongside it and then read their own speedometer.

'It's hard to imagine it these days, but back in the 70s high performance cars were only driven by the very rich, royalty or police officers.

'Hence the attraction of the job for many a small boy.

'As part of our research for the force's 40th anniversary this year we were lucky enough to find some old footage of one of our very own Rover 3500's being taken for a test spin.'
