Chris Henry faces an uncertain playing future after the shocking news he has suffered blockage in a blood vessel in his brain.

Henry was named in the team to play South Africa on November 8, but was withdrawn on the morning of the match after falling ill.

It was initially suggested the cause was a severe migraine, but the Ireland management revealed yesterday it was far more serious than that.

‘Chris Henry suffered some weakness on the morning of the South Africa game and a viral illness was suspected.

‘He recovered quickly and the initial diagnosis was of severe migraine,’ read a statement. ‘Further tests, however, have shown he suffered a temporary blockage of a small blood vessel in his brain.

‘He is at home now and is well but needs further investigation and specialist opinion.’

The news will inevitably raise questions about Henry’s playing future, given the understandable vigilance with which brain conditions are treated in professional sport.

The flanker became a regular during last season's six nations, but his future is now in doubt

In the short-term, he is not expected to feature for Ireland or Ulster.

Mike McCarthy, meanwhile, suffered a concussion against Georgia on Sunday.

Jared Payne is also still battling to be fit to face Australia on Saturday, but Rory Best will be available for selection.
