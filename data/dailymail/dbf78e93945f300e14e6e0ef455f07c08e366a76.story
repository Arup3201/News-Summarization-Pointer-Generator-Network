Questioned: The £195,000-per-year Care Quality Commission boss Cynthia Bower

Ministers have launched an inquiry into the watchdog which regulates hospitals and care homes over concerns that its failings have put patients at risk.

Officials from the Department of Health took action because of fears that the Care Quality Commission was failing in its responsibility to carry out the inspections that can root out poor care.

It follows growing criticism of the quango which failed to notice abuse of residents at the Winterbourne View care home in Bristol for people with learning disabilities and took action only after undercover filming by the BBC’s Panorama programme.

Last week, the Department of Health’s permanent secretary Una O’Brien called in CQC chief executive Cynthia Bower for questioning over the organisation’s perceived failings.

A team of officials from the department also visited the quango’s headquarters to investigate its operations.

Miss Bower is paid £195,000 a year and has one of the largest taxpayer-funded pension pots in the public sector.

Before taking up her post at the CQC she was head of the NHS West Midlands health authority.

Her job there included supervising the performance of Stafford Hospital, where hundreds of patients died needlessly in the A&E department.

The CQC, which was set up by Labour in 2009, is already under investigation by the National Audit Office and the Commons public accounts committee amid growing concerns that the body is not fit for purpose to oversee 20,000 hospitals, care homes and clinics.

Two months ago the health select committee of MPs lambasted the CQC for neglecting its duty of scrutinising patient care in favour of tick-box ‘registration’ of care providers.

It emerged yesterday that in 2010/11, the CQC carried out only 7,368 inspections and reviews – despite telling Parliament in its annual report that the total was 15,220.

The organisation has also cut down on the number of investigations it carries out into care scandals.

Over the last year it carried out just one – into Winterbourne View – compared to the 16 that the Healthcare Commission, the CQC’s predecessor, carried out in five years.

Miss Bower disbanded the CQC’s investigations team soon after taking up her post – even though NHS bosses told her that failure to publicise examples of poor care could encourage complacency.

There has been a staff exodus at the organisation, following claims by employees of a culture of bullying.

This has made it harder for the CQC to carry out inspections.

The National Care Association, which represents care home providers, has warned of the risk of a ‘complete loss of confidence in the regulator throughout the sector’.

It told the health select committee: ‘Our members pay large amounts of money to be regulated and expect in return to be the subject of robust inspection and a critical friend relationship.

‘The reality is that now more than ever there is very limited inspection; just a paper chase.’

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘It is essential that the CQC is performing to the highest possible standards.

‘We are currently carrying out a review to ensure that it is doing the best it can to protect patients.

‘The findings of the review will be made public in the New Year.’

A spokesman for the CQC said: ‘The review has been openly discussed with CQC stakeholders and staff, and we have found it an extremely helpful process.’

The CQC said the review was in no sense out of the ordinary, as all health quangos were undergoing a ‘capacity and performance review’. It has been announced in September.

Yesterday, health secretary Andrew Lansley told Health Service Journal magazine that the review did not reflect a lack of confidence in the leadership of the CQC – and said it was now running a ‘proactive and tough’ inspection regime.
