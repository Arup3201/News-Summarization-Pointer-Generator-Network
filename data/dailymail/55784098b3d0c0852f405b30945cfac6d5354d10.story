The lyrics are familiar from a thousand nativity plays and Christmas carol services.

But what do the words to Away In a Manger mean exactly?

That is the question pondered by television historian Mary Beard after she attended this year's annual carol service at King's College, Cambridge.

Confusion: Mary Beard, a professor in classics at Cambridge, wrote about the 'weird' Away In a Manger lyrics in a newspaper column

The historian, a professor in classics at Cambridge University, wrote about how she was struck by the phrase 'no crib for a bed' as she perused the lyrics printed in her order of service.

Writing in her column in the Times Literary Supplement, Professor Beard said of the printed lyrics: 'It did make you reflect on what made a good carol, what was the right blend of sentimentality and jolliness.

'It also made you reflect on how weird some of the words were (what actually does "no crib for a bed" mean?),' she added.

The confusion is thought to arise from the fact that - at least in Britain - a crib and a manger are essentially the same thing; a trough from which an animal can eat fodder.

Meaning interpreting the phrase 'away in a manger, no crib for a bed' could present something of a conundrum.

But in the U.S., where the carol was first published in Philadelphia in 1885, a crib is defined as a small bed for infants and young children.

One reader posted a reply to Professor Beard's column which said: 'I think we must apply a principle of charity and interpret the words in a way that makes them sensible.

'As a manger has just been mentioned, we must take "crib" to have only the meaning of a proper little bed designed for children.'
