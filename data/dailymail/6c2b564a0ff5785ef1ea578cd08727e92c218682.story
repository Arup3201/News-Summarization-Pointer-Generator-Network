Manchester United will pay a staggering £785,000 this week to players currently out injured or doubtful for Saturday's trip to Arsenal.

Louis van Gaal's team has been decimated by a succession of injury blows and will be well below strength for the teatime clash at the Emirates.

But whether they're in training or on the treatment table, United are still shelling out a fortune in wages.

The most high-profile absentee is Colombian striker Radamel Falcao, with Van Gaal confirming he'll be out for another two weeks with the calf injury that has already kept him on the sidelines for a month.

Falcao, who is on loan from Monaco, earns £280,000-a-week at Old Trafford and a mickey-taking website has sprung up that calculates how much he has earned since joining on Deadline Day.

The tally was creeping towards the £4m mark on Friday morning but he has only featured in five matches for United, scoring one goal.

Daley Blind will be out for several months with a knee ligament injury sustained in Holland's Euro 2016 qualifier with Latvia but will still coin in £75,000-a-week.

There had been confusion over the extent of Blind's injury setback, with United's official Twitter account inadvertently saying he could be out for six months.

But Van Gaal said: 'First he needs to rest for 10 days, then we will have a better idea. I can't say it will be six to eight weeks.

'I can't even say it will be 10 to 12 weeks. But it is definitely not six months.'

Defender Marcos Rojo, who also arrived in the summer, earns £70,000-a-week but suffered a dislocated shoulder in the 1-0 defeat to Manchester City earlier this month. He will be out for a few more weeks.

His injury is to merely scratch the surface of United's defensive woes, with Rafael Da Silva, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans also out at the minute.

Rafael, who is on £50,000-a-week, has a muscular problem, Jones (£50,000-a-week) has a calf and shin problem, while Evans (£65,000-a-week) has an ankle injury. 

Luke Shaw had an injury scare in England's friendly win over Scotland on Wednesday and was taken off as a precaution after feeling his hamstring tighten but should be fine for Arsenal.  

In midfield, Ashley Young, who brings home £115,000-a-week, is absent with a groin and pelvis injury. He is believed to be close to a return.

Michael Carrick, who earns £80,000-a-week, has been suffering from a similar problem but may return this weekend subject to a late fitness test.

It all adds up to a very expensive bill for players who aren't actually available for selection.

At least Van Gaal received some good news ahead of the trip to London with goalkeeper David De Gea and playmaker Angel Di Maria fine after injury scares over the international fortnight.

The injury epidemic partly explains why United, despite spending £150m over the summer, are seventh ahead of the weekend's action.

Van Gaal will be praying there are no further setbacks as United try and challenge for the Champions League places.
