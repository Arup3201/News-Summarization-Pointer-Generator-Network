American sports car drivers are mythologised on film as the Fast And The Furious; but with strobes, LEDs and holograms, these Japanese boy racers may as well be the Fast And The Fabulous.

Lighting up the streets of Tokyo after dark, these flamboyant Lamborghini fanatics' customised fleet of supercars flash past pedestrians like automotive fireworks displays.

Aside from multicoloured LED lights, the group also wrap their cars in chrome and holograms, add powerful strobes and even fit flame shooting exhausts - leading to comparisons with the Fast And Furious film series.

Fanatical: New Jersey-born filmmaker Steve Feldman says Japanese boy racers love to modify and customise their supercars

Fascinating: Aside from multicoloured LED lights, the group also wrap their cars in chrome and holograms and add powerful strobe lights

New Jersey born filmmaker Steve Feldman, who learned Japanese at college, travelled to Japan to take a ride inside their world.

He said adding garish lights to already flashy sports cars is something unique to Japan.

'The Japanese are very group oriented and these guys cruise together, eat together and spend a lot of time together. Probably more time together than with their own families,' he said.

'They are not afraid to stand out and they don't care what people say to them. They don't think they are ruining supercars by doing what they do.

'All of this is very different to US car culture. Americans think a supercar is a piece of art that should not be messed with, certainly not neon lights, LEDs and other crazy custom stuff.'

Mr Feldman also said that Lamborghinis are the favoured choice of vehicle because they reflect the group's bold personality.

'Lamborghinis make the biggest statement. They are tough, mean and stand out. You got to have big balls to drive a Lambo,' he said.

'They remember being kids and seeing the Lamborghini Countach, and they grew up knowing they would drive Lambos and they remain loyal to their favourite brand.

'They are among the proudest Lambo owners anywhere.'
