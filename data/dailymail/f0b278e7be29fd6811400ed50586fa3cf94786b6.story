Marco Reus completed a hat-trick against Galatasaray on Tuesday night, despite scoring only once.

The Borussia Dortmund star scored his side's first goal in the 4-1 win at the Westfalenstadion, and celebrated by covering his mouth with his hand.

For iPhone users who may have kept an eye on the 25-year-old's form in recent weeks, the celebration completed a trio of emoji references.

The three popular symbols - a symbol of a monkey covering his eyes, ears and mouth - have been Reus' celebration for his last three goals.

Reus covered his ears on Saturday for his goal against Bayern Munich, covered his eyes for the strike against St Pauli last week and completed the hat-trick on Tuesday.

The symbols, a play on the phrase 'hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil' are among the most popular emojis used on the iPhone.

It remains to be seen whether Reus will continue the trend by emulating another emoji symbol, but despite it being all smiles in Europe, his side are struggling in the Bundesliga.

They have qualified from their Champions League group with ease and should top the standings after Arsenal squandered a three-goal lead against Anderlecht.

But domestically Jurgen Klopp's side are joint bottom with just two wins in 10 games.

They face third-place Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday at the Westfalenstadion.
