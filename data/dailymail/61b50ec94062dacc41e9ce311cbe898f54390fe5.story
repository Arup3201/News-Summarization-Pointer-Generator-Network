Alice Springs is an arid region in central Australia, positioned some 1500km from the nearest beach.

Locals may not have any waves to catch, but they have managed to quench their thirst for surfing with an unorthodox daredevil-friendly pastime.

Hilarious GoPro footage shows a group of young larrikins towing themselves on surfboards from utes on the muddy waters of Ilparpa claypans, just south of Alice Springs.

One of the men behind the video, Philip Drummond, said his friends were inspired after going to a 21st birthday party on the Gold Coast.

‘We got a taste for surfing there, then we brought some surfboards back home and took them down to the claypans,' he said.

'We didn’t have much surfing experience, but we picked it up as we went along.’

After several years of trial and error, the friends have refined act to be somewhere between wakeboarding and water skiing.

‘We started off pretty slow at about 15 km per hour or so, but once we built up our confidence we were goingup to 40 kmph,’ he said.

The video was filmed over four days in the middle of last year, a time when the Red Centre was experiencing torrential rain.

‘The claypan retains water very well, but there are few points of the year when we have that much water. We need to capitalise when we get the chance,’ Drummond said.

Drummond said none of his friends have suffered any serious injuries from the claypan surfing.

When asked if it was legal, he said it was a ‘grey area.’

‘It’s government land we’re using, but there are our-wheel drives tearing up there all the time. I don’t think what we do is any more damaging,’ he said.
