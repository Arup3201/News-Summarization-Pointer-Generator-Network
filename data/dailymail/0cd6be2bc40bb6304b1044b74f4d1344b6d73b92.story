Two of Britain’s energy giants have a new claim to notoriety – their customer service is even worse than Ryanair’s.

In a survey of around 3,600 consumers, Npower has ousted the controversial budget airline from the unwanted title of the worst for client care.

It follows its introduction of a new billing system that left hundreds of thousands of families baffled about what they owed.

Also making Ryanair look better was Scottish Power, which was ordered to pay a £750,000 penalty earlier this year for hitting customers who settle their bills with cash or cheque with unfair fees. Ryanair – which has risen from 100th to 98th in the league table compiled by consumer organisation Which? – has managed for years to annoy many of its customers with its baggage and payment fees and the combative attitude of its chief executive Michael O’Leary.

But Npower and Scottish Power are not alone in their sector as the other four of the ‘big six’ energy firms – British Gas, SSE, Eon and EDF – all feature in the bottom 20. Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?, said: ‘The big six energy companies have now hit rock bottom for customer service and, with record high levels of complaints, it is clear just how far they still have to go to put things right for their customers.

‘It’s disappointing that some of our biggest firms seem to have a lot to learn about keeping their customers happy.

‘This survey should be a wake-up call for the companies with the lowest customer scores.’ Npower was warned by energy regulator Ofgem earlier this year that it faces a multi-million pound fine unless it sorts out its billing system.

Thousands of customers were not sent bills for months, sometimes a year, despite repeated requests. The net result was they were then hit with huge bills – more than £1,000 in some cases – with demands to pay up or face enforcement action.

There were also serious problems with direct debit payments. Some customers were owed hundreds of pounds by Npower as a result of over-payments, and have had difficulty getting their money back.

In May, Scottish Power, which is owned by a Spanish firm, was ordered to pay £750,000 after Ofgem found it had hit thousands of customers who pay by cash and cheque with extra charges of £180 a year. The watchdog found the fees amounted to overcharging of around £100 a year.

Other poor performers on customer service include TalkTalk, mobile phone operator EE, and BT. First place for service went to the telephone and internet bank First Direct, which is part of HSBC.

Second went to natural cosmetics chain Lush, while in joint third place were John Lewis, Lakeland and Waitrose. Praise also went to Specsavers, Waterstones and Green Flag.

Npower admitted problems but said these were being addressed. ‘We’re determined to improve and we’re already making progress,’ it said.

Energy UK, which speaks for suppliers, said all the firms are well aware of the importance of customer service ‘and are working hard to improve’.
