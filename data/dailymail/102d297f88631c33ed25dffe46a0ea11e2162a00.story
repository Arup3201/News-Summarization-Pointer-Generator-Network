The host: Millionaire's daughter Jessica Kennaway has issued an apology after noise from her all-night 18th birthday party was heard three miles away from her Devon home

Even in the best of homes, teenage parties can get a little rowdy.

But the one thrown by millionaire’s daughter Jessica Kennaway did more than just upset the next-door neighbours.

The all-night bash was so loud it could be heard three miles away. It went on until police arrived at 7am on Sunday to tell Miss Kennaway to turn the music down.

And after complaints from angry villagers, the 18-year-old was told by the local council to apologise, although her mother insisted it was ‘just a few people having a bit of fun’.

Miss Kennaway organised the extravagant party, which had its own DJ and at least 60 guests, to mark the start of her gap year and a friend’s 18th birthday.

It was mostly held outdoors at Escot House, her family’s stately home.

But while the secluded Grade II listed mansion is set in 1,100 acres of Devon woodland, the revelry was loud enough to wake residents in three neighbouring villages.

They said they had never heard such a din coming from the estate, which has been owned by the Kennaway family for 210 years and for the past ten years has been open to the public, hosting upmarket festivals, weddings and concerts.

Allison Britz, who lives a mile away in Feniton, was one of dozens who used Facebook and Twitter to express their disbelief at the level of noise.

The 49-year-old sales manager described the party as ‘very selfish’ and said people in the villages of Buckerell and Payhembury, almost three miles away, were also disturbed.

‘We all enjoy a party and no one objects to it once in a while if we are notified about it and it doesn’t go on all night,’ she said.

‘But this was absolutely crazy, the thump-thump-thump of the music went on all night.

‘My six-year-old woke up and asked me what the noise was.

'My niece and her friends who were staying knew all the songs that were being played, it wasn’t just a drone of background noise.’

Mother-of-two Clare Humpreys said she, her daughters and her mother were also kept awake.

‘I barely slept until 5.30am,’ she said.

‘I went on Facebook from around 3.30am and couldn’t believe how many other people were awake because of it.’

Devon and Cornwall Police said officers gave ‘strong words of advice’ when they went to the manor house.

Bosses at East Devon District Council, who received complaints about the noise, instructed Miss Kennaway to apologise in person to villagers.

The teenager, who is preparing to leave for a nine-month trip to South America, said: ‘I warned all our neighbours about the party and they all seemed fine with it.

'We put the speakers in the direction of the valley to minimise the volume.’

Miss Kennaway, whose 20-year-old sister Olivia is away at university, added: ‘During the course of the night, as everyone became absorbed in the party atmosphere, what started as an acceptable volume level must have crept up.

‘I’ve been back to apologise to some of the farmers and neighbours who were affected by the noise as I didn’t mean to disturb anyone.

Venue: Police were called to the home and Escot estate near Ottery St Mary, East Devon, around 4am on Sunday following complaints about the noise

Business: Since the early 2000s the Escot estate has been opened up to the public to help fund repair work of the aging building. The venue hosts weddings, concerts and other events for families

In charge: The house has been owned by the Kennaway family for 210 years with John-Michael Kennaway (pictured) taking over in the 1980s

‘I
would like to apologise to local residents for not realising that the 
volume had reached an unacceptable level and, therefore, for disturbing 
their Sunday morning.’

But 
Miss Kennaway’s mother, Lucy, 47 – who was aware the party had been 
planned and was in the house with her husband John-Michael, 51 – while 
it took place, has defended her daughter’s party.

‘It was just a private party and a few people getting together to have a bit of fun,’ she said.

Escot House is a privately owned 19th-century country house, and has been the home of the Kennaway family, whose ancestors include Baronets and politicians, for 200 years.

Sir John Henry Kennaway, the third Baronet, was conservative Member of Parliament for East Devon and Honiton, between 1870 and 1885.

The 220 acre estate was designed by Capability Brown, and the gardens are now open to the public.

Since the early 2000s the Escot estate has been opened up to help fund repair work of the aging building.

In
addition to the Beautiful Days Festival, which attracts thousands of 
revellers every August, the estate boasts several visitor attractions and
hosts conferences, weddings, plays and concerts.

‘Jess ensured that all the neighbours 
were aware of the party and warned them a few days before – she’s since 
been back to apologise to those affected.

‘The wind meant that the volume and music travelled a lot further than it would usually have, which is very unfortunate.

‘We called her at one point to ask her to turn the music down, which she did right away.’

Escot House, near Ottery St Mary, was built in 1678 and bought by the Kennaway family in 1794.

Miss
Kennaway’s ancestors include baronets and MPs. Her millionaire father, 
who took over the property in the 1980s, makes his money from fish 
farming and from the estate.

The original mansion was destroyed by a fire in 1808 and rebuilt to a design by architect Henry Roberts in 1838.

It
hosts the Beautiful Days Festival, which attracts thousands of 
revellers every August, as well as regular theatre evenings, 
conferences, tours and nature days for children.
