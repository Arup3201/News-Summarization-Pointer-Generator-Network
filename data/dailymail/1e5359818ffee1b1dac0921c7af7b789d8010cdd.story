Ex-Emmerdale star Cy Chadwick at Leeds Crown Court where he is facing charges of indecent assault

A former star of the soap Emmerdale star has gone on trial accused of forcing a young boy who looked up to him ‘like a big brother’ to perform a sex act on him.

Cy Chadwick, 45, who played Nick Bates for ten years in the programme, is alleged to have indecently assaulted a boy between September 1985 and September 1987, when the schoolboy was eight or nine-years-old.

The complainant was sleeping on a camp bed when the alleged abuse took place, a court heard.

Now in his 30s, the complainant only reported it to police in May last year, telling police in a video interview that he came forward ‘because it’s always in the news - it’s constantly on my mind’.

‘How did I know he’s not done it to anybody else at the time. I thought he was going to get to be an old man and do it to someone else,’ he said during the interview played to Leeds Crown Court.

‘Something’s got to be done.’

Addressing the jury before the opening of Chadwick’s trial today, Judge Neil Clark told them: ‘The defendant played a part in the soap Emmerdale. It’s important when you hear the evidence, please remember you’re trying the defendant Cy Chadwick – not a character in the show and not the character he played in the show.

‘You try the case on what you hear in this room, about this man and not the character he played. You should try him in the same way as anyone else who appears before this court.’

Prosecuting, Geraldine Kelly told the court that Chadwick used to take the schoolboy out on day trips in his car, and giving him gifts, including a record player and records.

The complainant, talking in a police interview video which was shown to the court, told: ‘We were friendly.

‘I looked up to him as a big brother to be honest.’

The Fox And Grapes pub in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, was owned by the mother and stepfather of Cy Chadwick and where the abuse is alleged to have happened

Asked what they would usually do together, the complainant said: ‘Just messing around with stuff. Board games, normal stuff. He used to take me out.‘I liked him. I did. 

‘He bought me a record player, records, little trinkets which obviously I thought was brilliant.

‘He had the fanciest equipment anyone could buy because he had loads of money, obviously. He had every electrical gadget you could buy.

‘He had records, turntables, computers, fancy TVs.’

The complainant told how on the night in question he had been lying on the camp bed while Chadwick was lying on his bed, when Chadwick pulled back the covers.

It is alleged that Chadwick said to the schoolboy: ‘Put it in your mouth, this is what grown-ups do when they’re friends’.

The boy allegedly obeyed after which he described feeling ‘sick’ and ‘peculiar’.

Afterwards, Chadwick told the boy ‘not to say anything’, and left the room, sleeping elsewhere, the court heard.

The complainant said he had not seen Chadwick since.

Chadwick, who now works in TV production and lives in Pudsey, West Yorks., watched the evidence silently from the dock.

He denies one charge of indecent assault between September 17, 1985 and September 17, 1987.

The trial continues.
