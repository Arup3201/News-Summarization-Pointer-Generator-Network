Road rage has become a major problem across the world, but in Australia the first example of road reassurance may have taken place.

Motorcyclist Mathew Sant was travelling along Canberra Avenue toward the city on Tuesday in an 80km/h zone when he was rear-ended. Instead of reacting furiously though, he gave the guilty driver a thumbs up. 

'Traffic had backed up ahead and come to a stop,' he said on YouTube after uploading a video of what happened. 

All things seem to be going well as motorcyclist Mathew Sant stops in traffic along Canberra Avenue

Suddenly he is thrown in the air off his motorbike after getting rear-ended by a car 

Instead of losing his temper at what happened Mr Sant gives the driver a thumbs up

To make it even clearer there are no hard feelings he shakes the driver's hand

'As I came to a stop I checked my mirror and moved to the right of the road in case the car behind wasn't paying attention. 

'I saw him come to a stop and relaxed, looking away. The next thing I knew I was looking at the sky.'

In the YouTube video Mr Sant is seen going steadily along, minding his own business, in a lane of traffic and all seems to be going well.

However, after coming to a standstill because the cars in front have stopped, a car comes up behind the motorcyclist and crashes into the back of him. 

It's only when he looks back that he sees the rest of the carnage that has taken place

Mr Sant would have been within his rights to give the driver what for, but flashes him a thumbs up instead. 

It's the last thing the driver expects and he asks worriedly: 'Are you all right mate?'

Even then Mr Sant remains cool and composed. He shakes hands with the driver and laughs at all that just happened.

It is only then that the motorcyclist walks back to see the carnage that occurred behind him.

Mr Sant has then a chance to see how lucky he was after the accident

After breathing a sigh of relief he thanks his lucky stars the accident didn't turn out to be worse

He soon realises that he wasn't the only victim as the initial crash caused a three-car pile up, with other motors badly damaged. 

After surveying the scene the reality of how lucky he was finally dawns on him.

'I can't believe I'm all right,' he says thankfully.
