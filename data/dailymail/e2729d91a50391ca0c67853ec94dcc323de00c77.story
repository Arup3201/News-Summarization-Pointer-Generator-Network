Overly ambitious, feasible or simply just a scam - whatever your view on the Mars One mission, it has at least inspired people to think of colonising other worlds.

And now a sketch for the project has revealed the habitat the first astronauts on Mars could reside in - if they ever get there.

It includes living quarters, a laboratory, a greenhouse and even a holodeck to give the crew the best conditions possible on the red planet.

The concept, drawn up by Mars One's Capsule and Outpost Manager, Kristian von Bengtson from Denmark, consists of two long cylindrical inflatable habitats - with a total area of 2,150 square feet (200 square metres).

In February 100 people - including five Britons - were shortlisted for the questionable Mars One mission, which claims it will send people to live on the red planet.

They are hoping to be chosen to be among the final crew of four who are set to begin their new lives in just 10 years time - and ultimately die on Mars.

The team is scheduled to arrive in 2025 following a gruelling seven-month journey from Earth.

'The large cut in candidates [from 200,000 to 100] is an important step towards finding out who has the right stuff to go to Mars,' said Bas Lansdorp, co-founder of the Dutch Mars One mission.

'These aspiring Martians provide the world with a glimpse into who the modern day explorers will be.'

The Mars 100 Round Three candidates were selected from a pool of 660 candidates after participating in personal online interviews.

They include 50 men and 50 women who successfully passed the second round. 

At the front, each has a module to which a lander can attach and the crew can enter. One of the habitats is designed more for living, while the other seems to be geared more towards work.

In the residential habitat, there is a kitchen for food preparation with a total area of 320 square feet (30 square metres).

Moving further into the habitat and you come to a social area of a similar area, which has a ‘holodeck’ to keep the crew entertained.

This appears to consist of screens on the walls of the habitat, to simulate being in another environment.

Further along, are the private crew quarters, measuring about 65 square feet (six square metres).

And finally, the crop section, which grows the food the astronauts will need to survive, is found at the end. It has a watering system and humidity controls to keep everything in working order.

In the ‘work’ habitat, there is a laboratory and science section for various experiments - including an insects cabinet and biology laboratory.

There’s also a storage area to keep cargo, while the section is also curtailed by a crop system as well. 

Mars One made headlines around the world in February when it revealed the final longlist of 100 applicants who will train on Earth for a one-way mission to the red planet in 2025.

But the proposed mission has been widely criticised ever since it was first announced in 2011 - and experts have said this latest announcement does nothing to silence the sceptics.

Lack of funding, no signs of development and an overly ambitious ‘reality TV’ approach have all been cited as reasons that Mars One will never be more than a pipe dream.

‘You have to applaud the ambition, but sadly the whole project feels very much like wing-and-a-prayer stuff when you start to look into the details,’ Giles Sparrow, author of Mars: A New View of the Red Planet, told MailOnline.

‘They say they can put a first crew on Mars for $6 billion [£3.9 billion], which is a shoestring budget compared to the Apollo programme which cost $25 billion [£16.2 billion] - and that was in 1960s money!’

It could be you: Pictured are some of the Mars One hopefuls, who will be spending eight years in training ahead of what they think will be a mission to Mars, although the mission has been widely criticised for the lack of a feasible plan to actually get to the red planet

In the sketch the habitat has a social area with a ‘holodeck’ to keep the crew entertained. This appears to consist of screens on the walls of the habitat, to simulate being in another environment - so it'll likely be a bit more primitive than the holodeck used in Star Trek (shown)

Dr Lewis Dartnell from the Space Research Centre at the University of Leicester added: ‘‘There are a large number of technological considerations for safely sending a human mission to Mars.

‘These include the long-term reliability of life-support systems and how to grow sufficient food and for a balanced diet, and these necessary technologies are not yet mature enough or well-tested in less risky situations -such as on a moon base.

‘But even the first step of securing enough large rockets to launch the mission to Mars has not been demonstrated by Mars One.’

However CEO and co-founder of Mars One responded to the criticism, telling MailOnline he believed they ‘have a good plan and we can overcome the challenges.’

Later in February, though, the production company Endemol announced they would no longer be making an accompanying TV show for the venture.

This would have documented the training and lives of the astronauts on the red planet.

Mars One said they were now working with a new production company to record the colonists’ progress.

The latest sketch seems to be a bit different to previous concepts shown by Mars One. This one shows habitats and a rover on the surface. Who will build these habitats is not quite clear, although they appear to bear some similarity to SpaceX's proposed Red Dragon capsule

The mission is still without suitable funding, any signs of development, a spacecraft or a place on a rocket launch
