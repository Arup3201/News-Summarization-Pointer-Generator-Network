When seamstress Steph Peterson watched the David Bowie cult classic 'Labyrinth' with her family, inspiration struck.

The only way to top last year's Beetlejuice-inspired Halloween costumes was to dress her husband, two children and dog up as characters from the 1986 hit movie.

And her efforts have paid off - the Utah mom's incredible ensemble costume has already won Halloween 2013 after a picture of her family was posted to Reddit.

'I was telling the kids that my husband was a dead ringer for Bowie when we first met, and realized my son would make the perfect Goblin King,' Peterson told Huffington Post. 'Because he truly is a mini Bowie!'

Peterson, who sells her creations on Etsy, decked out her husband as the gigantic beast Ludo, her son Gage as a miniature Jareth the Goblin King, daughter Bailey as Sarah Williams and their dog Banjo as Sir Didymus.

'I started with Ludo because he was going to be the hardest ... I carved his face from construction foam, coated it with light plaster and painted it. I made a body suit of fake fur and voila! Ludo was born,' Peterson told Huffington Post.

'Of course, my poor husband has to sweat his Halloween away, but I think it's worth it. My daughter's dress was originally a wedding dress that I altered a great deal.

'My son's costume was mostly a collection of thrift finds from eBay. I made Sir Didymus from a toy stuffed dog and added the clothes, eye patch and hat.'

The elaborate costumes are so incredible, Peterson's photos have gone viral after they were posted online.

But it's not the first time the clever mom has created a buzz with her ghoulish creations.

Last Halloween, Peterson decked out her family as characters from 'Beetlejuice'.

The year before, she turned Gage into a miniature Edward Scissorhands and Bailey into The Red Queen from Alice in Wonderland.

'I’ve always loved Halloween and started really doing it when I created a
 Corpse Bride dress seven years ago,' Peterson told The Salt Lake Tribune.

'I decided to sell one on Ebay and 
the next year, I made 35 different dresses. They sold all over the world
 and even to a couple of ballet companies, so I just kept going. I’ve 
made wedding dresses for people all over.

'Tim Burton is definitely a favorite [for inspiration]. I 
like doing costumes that haven’t been done before, so I try to come up 
with ideas all year.

'I like making the kids into the main characters. 
It’s more fun and unique that way.'

In 2011, Peterson dressed Gage as Edward Scissorhands and Bailey as The Red Queen from Alice in Wonderland
