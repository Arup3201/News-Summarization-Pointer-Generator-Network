When animal-loving zookeeper Scott Adams, 31, from Telford, proposed to his long term love Verity Clarke, 26, he had already decided that only a wildlife themed wedding would do.

Much to his surprise, his paramedic bride-to-be agreed - and even allowed him to take complete control over planning for their nuptials.

But with £1,800 spent on life-size plastic animals for the reception and just £96 on the dress, the results weren't quite what she bargained for.

Big day: Scott and Verity's big day involved plastic zoo animals and a pair of very real pygmy crocodiles

Happy couple: Romantic Scott decided to make Verity's bouquet a tropical one

'All I could think was how can he be given so much money and yet not pay out for a proper wedding dress!' she laughs.

The couple married this summer in a wildlife-themed wedding, complete with sharp-toothed special guests in the shape of a pair of pygmy crocodiles.

But Verity, who will appear with Scott on BBC3 show Don't Tell The Bride, says dress notwithstanding, she would be happy to let her new husband do it all over again.

'I was happy for Scott to make the 
decisions because it was a once in a lifetime opportunity and we would
 never have been able to afford such a wedding if we hadn't have been on the 
show,' she confesses.

'Obviously, I trust him. He always does great little surprises 
for me so I thought he would do a good job, although I didn't trust him 
with the dress.

'He doesn't always have the best taste in clothes though,
but I hoped he would get some inspiration from somewhere and choose 
well.'

Unfortunately for Verity, Scott's inspiration came from eBay instead. 'On eBay, I had 14,000 dresses to choose 
from,' he protests.

'I had more choice than any dress shop could have ever offered so it was exactly what I wanted.' He adds: 'I would totally 
recommend an eBay wedding dress.'

Scott, who describes his ideal wedding as 'crazy, memorable and nothing normal - just like my whole life so far', says he loved the experience of planning his big day and says more grooms should get involved.

Perfect venue: The couple married within Cornwall's Eden Project - a series of domed biospheres

'I guess I should say don't do it,' he says, 'but 
looking back, it was a once in a life time experience and it you can take
 the pressure then just go for it and do it large.'

He also reveals that he was the one who first came up with the idea of getting married on television and says that too was 'very me'.

'I knew Verity would love what I planned 
as long as it came from the heart and she she did,' he adds. 'I'm good at planning 
things, although it isn't so easy with a film crew breathing down your neck.,'

For her part, and in spite of the eBay dress, Verity says she had a wonderful day that ended just as she had imagined it - married to the man she loves.

'The best part of the wedding was seeing 
Scott and knowing we were there to take the biggest step of out lives 
together,' she says. 'And seeing all our family and friends gathered together was 
wonderful.'

Smart choice: Verity looked lovely in her eBay dress and Scott says he would recommend it to anyone

What's more, despite not getting the church ceremony she had hoped for and having to share centre stage with a squad of plastic animals, she says she does think grooms should get more involved in wedding planning.

'The big day was really important to me 
as I wanted it to be a big coming together of all our friends and family,' she says.

'I wanted it to be somewhere traditional 
that was really picturesque and hoped for a church ceremony 
although I knew Scott would never go for that.'

She adds: 'I
 definitely think it proves that brides should give more thought to their fiance's thoughts when planning a wedding, even if something doesn't sound 
like a great idea.'

Scott himself says he wouldn't change a thing. 'I did everything I could to make the wedding perfect and very us, even though some of it might seem crazy,' he says.

'It was memorable and personal - just the way i imagined it.'
