Tax bill: Millionaire Michael Rockall, pictured with wife Gillian, claimed he needed a £6million yacht to impress his clients to avoid paying income tax on it

A millionaire who claimed he needed a £6million yacht to impress his clients has been ordered to pay tax on their luxury items after a tribunal ruled he personally benefited from the boat.

Michael Rockall, a former Barclays Bank executive turned entrepreneur, said his lavish lifestyle, which included buying diamond jewellery for his wife and daughter, was vital to 'convey the right image' to clients.

However, he now faces a hefty tax bill after the First-Tier Tax Tribunal ruled that he and wife Gillian must pay income tax on their fringe benefits.

After leaving Barclays, Mr Rockall, 70, 
set up a flourishing hotel and executive training business centred on 
two stately homes, Scalford Hall, in Melton Mowbray, and Whittlebury 
Hall, near the Silverstone motor racing circuit.

He
 was the financial brains behind the business - in which he worked 100 
hours-a-week until he suffered a heart attack in 1986 - and referred to 
his wife as a 'Lady Bountiful' who devoted herself to ensuring that 
delegates were well looked after.

Due
 to Mr Rockall's close connections with Formula 1 and prestige motor 
manufacturers, Whittlebury Hall generated income in excess of £1.5 
million every year during the British Grand Prix.

Through
 their business, the couple, of Woolverstone, Ipswich, bought a series 
of yachts of ever-increasing size, culminating in the purchase of the 
140-foot 'Masquerade of Sole' in 2001 for $11.9 million, around 
£6.9million.

The gems worn 
by Mrs Rockall and the couple's daughter included a necklace made up of 
103 round brilliant cut diamonds - bought for £150,000 in 2001 - and 
diamond drop earrings worth £38,000.

There
 were also two antique clocks made by 17th Century master, Thomas 
Tompian - including a long case piece bought for £460,000 in 2004 - and 
the couple's lifestyle was enough to attract the attention of HM Revenue
 and Customs.

Judge John 
Brooks told the tribunal that the Masquerade of Sole was used to 'explore
 potential business opportunities'. It would frequently sail around the Med, and 
could often be spotted in Monte Carlo harbour during the Monaco Grand Prix.

She
 was also chartered out - generating over £1.2 million in 2007 alone - 
and, partially allowing Mr and Mrs Rockall's appeal, the judge accepted 
that they had used the yacht and her predecessors for business, not 
private, purposes.

He also 
agreed that the jewellery was bound up in the business and had been worn
 by Mrs Rockall and her daughter, not for personal pleasure, but 'to 
convey the right image' to well-heeled clients and to keep up the 'need 
to impress'.

The clocks were also business assets kept at Whittlebury Hall or in an office.

However,
 Judge Brooks ruled that Mr and Mrs Rockall had also enjoyed a personal 
benefit from the yacht, jewellery and clocks which, whilst owned by 
their companies, had been 'placed at their disposal for their use'.

The
 exact amount of the couple's tax liability - from which they can make 
deductions to take account of the cost of running the Masquerade of Sole
 - has yet to be finally calculated.
