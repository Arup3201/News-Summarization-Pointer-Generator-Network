Newcastle have completed the season-long loan signing of Shakhtar Donetsk striker Facundo Ferreyra.

The 23-year-old Argentinian has joined up with the squad in Germany ahead of their final game of the Schalke 04 Cup against the hosts on Sunday afternoon.

Manager Alan Pardew would still like to bring another front-man to St James' Park but believes Ferreyra has the potential to succeed in the Premier League and an option is in place – thought to be in the region of £6m – to make the deal permanent.

Transfer: Argentinian striker Facundo Ferreyra has signed for Alan Pardew's men on a season-long loan

Pardew said: 'Facundo is someone we know on a number of levels, including his friendship with Fabricio (Coloccini), and we think he could be a big success here at Newcastle.

'This is a player who has played at the top level and is highly-regarded in Argentina.

'He has tremendous potential and hopefully he can realise that here at Newcastle United.'

Ferreyra, who scored 17 times for Velez Sarsfield in his homeland in 2013 before his move to Ukraine, had concerns about returning to Donetsk amid the political unrest and violence in the country.

Option: Alan Pardew has a £6million option to land Ferreyra on a  permanent deal if he impresses

Competition: Ferreyra will provide some much needed competition for Papiss Cisse and Emmanuel Riviere

Replacement: After failing to sign Loic Remy, Newcastle have finally secured another striker for the coming season

And he said: 'I am very pleased to sign for Newcastle United.

'I like the Premier League and when I knew that Newcastle were interested in me, it was a very easy decision to make

'I spoke to my friend Fabricio Coloccini, and when he told me about the club, I didn't need to think twice.'
