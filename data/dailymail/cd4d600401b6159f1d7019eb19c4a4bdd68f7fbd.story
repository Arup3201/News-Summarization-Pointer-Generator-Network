A grandmother-of-six has a eyebrow raising hobby - knitting penis-shaped blankets.

Holly Stewart, 59, wants to bring humour and art together to shun the typical stereotypes about old ladies.

Her craftmanship is on display at a US art gallery and some of the 'exhibits' are more than five-foot long.

Missouri grandmother Holly Stewart, pictured, enjoys working with cloth and 'frequently thinks about penises' 

Ms Stewart said her work was designed to challenge male dominance and question the power of men  

She also wanted to show that grandmothers can knit more exciting things than socks and blankets 

The grandmother-of-six, from Missouri, said: 'My favourite medium to work with is cloth and I frequently think about penises.

'I wanted to use these together and create something alluring and iconic.

'Quilting is a craft that women of a certain age are expected to employ - I did just that except instead of blankets I knit penises and scrotums.'

Using techniques she learned at the Kansas City Art Institute, Ms Stewart created beaded, sequinned and pinned penises.

An exhibition called HollyPolyester: Local Grandmother Quilts Giant Penises is taking place at the UMKC Gallery of Art in Kansas City, Missouri throughout September.

Ms Stewart said that people don't always identify immediately the subject of her various artworks 

The penises are in various sizes from a few inches up to several feet in length and come in various colours 

Ms Stewart has made her artworks in a range of fabrics giving each a different tactile experience 

Ms Stewart ran the exhibition to showcase the work she had done for her MA thesis in fibre and surface design.

She hopes her work will help people talk about gender, sexuality, sex and aging as well as change attitudes to the elderly and sex.

Ms Stewart said: 'I want people to see my work and ask questions about male dominance and the power of men.

'People first see them and they think they are granny's knick knacks but disguising the penises as soft toys makes people laugh and certainly makes them talk.' 

Some of Ms Stewart's extensive range of extravagant  penises are more prickly than others 

The artworks would make the ideal soft furnishing gift for most modern families with a sense of humour
