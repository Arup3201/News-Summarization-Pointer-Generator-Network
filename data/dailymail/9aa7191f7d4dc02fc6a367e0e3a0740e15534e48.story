England international goalkeeper Jack Butland has joined Derby County on loan.

The 21-year-old Stoke keeper is eager to gain more game time and will link up with former England boss Steve McClaren on Monday. 

Derby moved for Butland after regular No 1 Lee Grant suffered a fractured foot.

Butland has found first team chances difficult to come by at the Britannia Stadium, with the continued excellence of Asmir Begovic between the sticks. 

He is set to make his debut for Derby in their Sky Bet Championship fixture against Blackpool at Bloomfield Road on Tuesday night.

'We're extremely pleased to welcome Jack Butland to Derby County and I would like to extend our thanks to Stoke City for agreeing to let him join us on loan,' McClaren told his club's official website, dcfc.co.uk.

'Jack is a promising young goalkeeper and after Lee Grant picked up an injury on Saturday, as a management team, we quickly set about identifying someone to come into the group.

'We know a lot about Jack and he is someone who Eric Steele (Derby's goalkeeping coach) rates very highly.'

Meanwhile, his Stoke team-mate Andy Wilkinson is moving to Millwall on a 93-day loan. 

Wilkinson was also wanted by Fulham and Birmingham while both loan deals contain a recall option after the first month.
