The Royal Bank of Scotland said today it would relocate to England if voters choose Scottish independence next week.

It is another hammer blow for separatists as three major banks now look set to quit Scotland if there is a Yes campaign wins.

RBS, based in Scotland since its formation in 1727 , said today 'it would be necessary to re-domicile the bank's holding company' if next Thursday’s referendum ends the 307-year Union.  

Banks say they fear being downgraded if they lost the stability of the Union and RBS and Lloyds may even ask for emergency Westminster legislation to help speed through a move to England.

RBS employs 12,000 staff north of the border and is still headquartered in Gogarburn, to the west of Scottish capital Edinburgh,  but this main base would be moved south.

Lloyds Banking Group, which includes Halifax and Bank of Scotland and has 16,000 staff in Scotland, yesterday announced it would move its headquarters to London, in what has been called Alex Salmond's 'Black Wednesday'.

Scotland’s third bank, Clydesdale, was also reported to be preparing to leave and Edinburgh-based Standard Life said it would partially move to England, putting up to 5,000 finance jobs at risk.   

And Edinburgh-based Standard Life unveiled drastic plans to partially move to England, putting up to 5,000 finance jobs at risk. 

The First Minister says reports of banks leaving Scotland are 'nonsense' and 'scaremongering'.

The developments will ease the panic that followed a poll on Sunday putting the Yes camp ahead for the first time and led to the three main party leaders making emergency trips to Scotland to campaign 

Yesterday’s Survation poll found that 53 per cent of those who have made their mind up are planning to say No, against 47 per cent saying Yes. One in ten is still to decide. 

In a further blow to Mr Salmond two of the world’s largest oil giants yesterday came out against independence, as the industry overwhelmingly rejected his claims on how much oil remains in the North Sea.

BP and Shell both declared their support for the Union yesterday, throwing their weight behind a new warning from oil tycoon Sir Ian Wood that oil reserves in Scotland have been hugely overestimated by the Yes campaign. 

Shoppers in Scotland are likely to face higher prices if the country votes in favour of independence, one of the UK's leading retailers has warned.

John Lewis Partnership chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said it had no intention of reducing its commercial presence north of the border, where it has nine shops, a contact centre and employs more than 3,000 people.

But he cautioned that firms were unlikely to continue sharing the burden of higher operating costs in Scotland across all UK customers in the event of the break up of the Union.

He said he would 'regret' any move which damaged the retailers' partnership model.

'We have got a thriving business in Scotland, with nine shops, a contact centre and over 3,000 partners working there,' Sir Charlie told BBC Radio 4's Today.

'The debate has clearly become very, very fractious. As a businessman it is not my place to tell Scottish voters how to vote in next week's referendum.

'But I will say two things.

'From a business perspective there will be economic consequences to a Yes vote, not just in uncertainty but some of the turmoil we are hearing about.

'And it is also the case that it does cost more money to trade in parts of Scotland and therefore those hard costs, in the event of a Yes vote, are more likely to be passed on.'
