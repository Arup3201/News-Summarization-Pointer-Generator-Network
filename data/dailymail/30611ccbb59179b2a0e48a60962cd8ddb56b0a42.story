They've been engaged less than a month but Rory Mcllroy and Caroline Wozniaki appear to be set on making their engagement a truly international one.

After spending most of this month in Australia pursuing tennis success, it was Ms Wozniaki's turn to watch from the sidelines as she watched her fiance compete in Dubai.

Sporting a casual orange polo t-shirt and with her long blonde hair pulled into a messy ponytail, the Dane beamed as she wandered around the state-of-the-art golf course with a friend.

Miss Wozniaki, who was there to support her fiance as he competed in the second round of the 2014 Omega Dubai Desert Classic, also showed off a pair of enviably tanned legs as she sauntered around the course.

And she seems to be enjoying Dubai life away from the Emirates Golf Course too; yesterday tweeting of her excitement at meeting former Manchester United and Denmark goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.

The Gulf city is the latest stop on the pair's glamorous sporting world tour, with both required to spend much of the year abroad.

The pair began their year in Sydney, where the twosome became engaged after 24-year-old Rory proposed as they celebrated New Year's Eve.

The Danish former world No.1 confirmed the news of the proposal on her Twitter account. 'Happy new year everyone! Rory and I started 2014 with a bang! ...I said YES!!!!' she posted.

Rory then shared the same picture and 
added: 'Happy New Year everyone! I have a feeling it's going to be a 
great year!! My first victory of 2014 #shesaidyes!!'

The news will surprise sports fans after witnessing the pair's on-again/off-again relationship play out in public.

Loved up: The pair have never been shy about showing their affection for one another

Sources close to the pair claimed the Irish golfer, 24, broke it off with the Danish tennis pro in April - days after she posted a mean picture of Twitter showing him asleep and open-mouthed with his glasses on. 

Friends at the time said there was no way back and Wozniacki, 23, was described as being 'absolutely devastated'.

But Wozniacki was among the gallery watching McIlroy at the Dubai World Championships in November. It was the first time the Danish tennis star had been seen at a golf event since she donned a caddiesâ€™ overalls for the par three tournament at the Masters back in April.

Earlier this year, McIlroy was warned
 by Britain's greatest-ever golfer Nick Faldo to 'concentrate on golf' 
after a dramatic slump in form.

Last
 December, the pair were forced to deny rumours they were engaged after 
Wozniacki was spotted wearing a huge diamond ring on her wedding ring 
finger.

Speculation 
first began when the tennis star was seen flashing the diamond and 
sapphire jewel as she arrived at Brisbane International Airport.

However, it's also tradition for Danish women to wear their engagement and wedding rings on the right hands.
