Marius Tanase, an ethnic Roma, has worked in Spain and Britain before to provide for his five children.

But when border controls are relaxed in 2014 he plans to move to the UK permanently to escape a life of poverty in his home country.

His home town of Dilga, in Romania, has a population of 2,500 people but only dirt roads, no running water and unemployment is at 70 per cent.

Hopeful: Marius Tanase, and his daughter Denisa, six, wants to move to Britain in 2014 so his children can get a better education

Better future: Tudora, Marius's wife, has a two-hour commute to work as a cleaner in Romania

Searching: Costin Costea (left), 19, and his brother Florin, 17, are struggling to find work in Dilga, Romania, which has 70 per cent unemployment

Most of the working-age men and women have at some point worked abroad, mostly in Italy or Britain, as many say they are unable to find adequate work in Romania.

Marius says he will move not because of the possibility of earning more money, but because he thinks his five 
children will have a better chance at a full education in Britain.

Currently his wife Tudora works as a cleaner at a university in Bucharest which is a two-hour train commute away.

Another resident, Aneta Enache has three children who all live and 
work in Italy, send money home and only come to Dilga once a year to 
visit.

Aneta's grandaughter Madelina lives with her and her 
husband, who is unemployed after he lost his job at Romania's state-run 
railways.

Success: Mioara Costea and her husband Costel are comparatively wealthy as they own cows, turkeys, geese and chickens

Struggle: Xenia Costea (right), who runs one of just six shops in Dilga. She say customers often buy on credit

Tough: Viorica Gheorghe, left with her daughter Gabriela, three, says her family survives on her husband's salary of 200 Euros a month. Ten-year-old Madelina, right, does her English homework

During the communist era most Roma people worked in nearby state-run factories

Costin Costea, 19, recently finished high school 
and is helping his father Marian build a house while he looks for a job.

Marian worked for two years in Italy as a construction worker until he lost his job when the economy declined.

Viorica Gheorghe says her family of four survives on the 200 Euros a month her husband bring in from his job in Bucharest, a two-hour
train commute.

But others are not quite as desperate to change their fortunes.

Mioara and her husband Costel, who own cows, turkeys, geese and chickens, are comparatively wealthy.

Costel says he owes his success to his decision not to sell the ten hectares 
of land given to him after the fall of the Romanian communist 
government in 1989.

Most other Roma in Dilga did sell their land for 
money when times got hard.

Although his mother works in Italy as a 
nurse, Vasile Nedelcu says he would rather stay in Romania despite the 
difficult employment situation.

Staying: Vasile Nedelcu (right), with his friend Florin Arapu, says says he wants to stay in Romania, even though the employment situation is difficult

When Romania and Bulgaria first joined the EU in 2007, they instantly became the poorest countries in the union.

GDP per head in Romania is less than Â£8,000 per head, under a third of that in the UK.

This
huge disparity in wealth has prompted fears that Britain and other 
western countries will see an influx of Romanian immigrants once the 
final restrictions on their working throughout Europe are lifted at the 
end of this year.

These worries have been emphasised by media reports of widespread rural poverty, especially among the Roma or Gypsy communities.

Romania's Roma belong to a myriad of different tribes defined by their craft, and Dilga's belong to a group called the Rudari, who until the 1930s specialised in woodcrafts.

During the communist years most worked in nearby state-run factories and agricultural cooperatives, though the majority of these went bankrupt after 1989 and the local Roma lost their jobs.

Since then they have struggled to make ends meet and find a better future for their children, though projects initiated by the European Union and NGOs are helping some to launch small-scale enterprises and improve their children's education.
