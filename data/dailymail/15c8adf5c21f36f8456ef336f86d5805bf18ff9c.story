Three miners were trapped underground for up to an hour after a cave-in at a colliery in the early hours of this morning.

Rescuers
released the three trapped men after a trench collapsed at the 
Aberpergwm drift mine, in Glynneath, South Wales, just after 3am. Two of them were taken to hospital, but their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.

The cave-in comes seven weeks to the day after the deaths of four miners 
at the Gleision Colliery, 15 miles away.

Rescued: The three trapped men were released after a trench collapsed at the Aberpergwm drift mine, in Glynneath, South Wales, just after 3am

A Mid and West Wales Fire Brigade official said: 'Three
people were released, there were two casualties who were taken to 
hospital. The third person was released after receiving treatment at the scene.'

She added that the miners were released by a colliery rescue crew after being trapped for approximately one hour.

Firefighters stood by with lighting equipment and gave assistance until receiving the order to stand down at 5.58am.

A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesman confirmed that two men were taken to Morriston Hospital, Swansea. The extent of their injuries is not known, but they are not believed to be life-threatening.

The cave-in at the Neath Valley drift mine comes seven weeks after flooding at the Gleision Colliery in the neighbouring Swansea 
Valley killed four miners.

Phillip
Hill, 45, Garry Jenkins, 39, David Powell, 50, and Charles Breslin, 62,
died when a tunnel they were working in was flooded after a wall holding back a body of water collapsed.

A joint police and Health and Safety Executive investigation into the accident is still under way.

Neath
MP Peter Hain expressed concern for the miners injured today, but said 
the incident was thankfully not of the same magnitude as the tragedy in 
Gleision.

He said: 'Any injury to any miner is a cause for concern.

'This latest incident is endemic in mining, which is a risky activity.

'However, it cannot be compared to the tragic disaster which occurred in Gleision.

'Against the backdrop of Gleision people may be understandably more concerned.

'But
Aberpergwm is a modern and efficient mine. Its safety record is 
admirable and the mine is employing and recruiting more and more people 
every year.'

Mr Hain 
said he would be 'very concerned' if the Gleision tragedy cast a dark 
shadow over mining in his constituency, where '400 people are employed 
in highly skilled jobs'.

Aberpergwm first opened in the late 19th century, and during the 1930s more than 1,500 men were employed there.

It closed in 1985, but reopened 12 months later under private ownership.

The
mine, which is believed to have coal reserves of around 6.8 million 
tonnes, is now owned by American firm Walter Energy and employs around 
230 people.
