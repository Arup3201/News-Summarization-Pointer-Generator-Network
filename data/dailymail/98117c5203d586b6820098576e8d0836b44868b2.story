Rumours are growing that Facebook may be set to unveil a mobile phone to take on the iPhone.

The firm has sent out invites to US journalists for a special event at their usually secretive Silicon Valley HQ.

The invites promise to allow attendees to 'see what we're building' - with online rumours pointing to a phone.

The firm has been rumoured several times to be developing its own phone.

Its apps for existing phones have already been expanded to include many features found in other handsets, such as messaging and photo sharing through the recent purchase of Instagram.

Recent reports claim it has poached engineers from Apple's iPhone and iPad team to work on the project, which is believed to be being built by HTC.

The social networking giant has also previously collaborated with HTC to launch the ChaCha and Salsa phones with a dedicated 
Facebook button and deep integration of the social network.

However, it is believed the new handset could be fully Facebook branded, and run far more of the firm's software than any other handset.

Facebook is also preparing to roll 
out a new feature for its Messenger app which allows users to place free
voice calls to friends.

The feature is so far available only 
to iPhone users in Canada and is buried within the latest update to the 
app, but it will eventually allow users to make free internet voice 
calls, known as VoIP calls, to any Facebook friend.

Experts are saying it represents an 
attempt by the world's largest social network to dominate the social 
world by taking on the default calling function in mobile phones.
