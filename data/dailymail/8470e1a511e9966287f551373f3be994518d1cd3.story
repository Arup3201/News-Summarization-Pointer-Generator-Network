A former Deutsche Bank vice president says she was fired after suing last year alleging a sexist culture resulted in her being demoted for taking maternity leave.

Kelley Voelker filed a second lawsuit on Wednesday, this time for retaliation after she lost her job earlier this month.

The new suit is added on top of her gender bias claim filed last September in US District Court in Manhattan.

Mother: Kelley Voelker said she rejected her boss' urging that she take a 'reduced role' after her return from maternity leave in May 2010

A Deutsche Bank spokesman said: 'We take these allegations very seriously and are currently reviewing the complaint.'

In her complaint, Ms Voelker said she rejected her boss' urging that she take a 'reduced role' after her return from maternity leave in May 2010.

Upon her return, she said, Deutsche Bank directed bigger accounts to a male colleague, slashed her bonus, and tried to demote her to a 'vague' marketing job. The bank retracted the demotion after her lawyers complained, she said.

The lawsuit states: 'Plaintiff was retaliated against and ultimately 'mommy-tracked' for her decision to take maternity leave.'

However, 'It is not surprising that such discriminatory treatment is permitted when the company tolerates managers to use (derogatory terms), as well as allowing supervisors to entertain clients at strip clubs and make open remarks about pregnancy,' the lawsuit states.

The lawsuit states that the company 
'fosters an atmosphere where it seems appropriate to derail the careers 
of hardworking mothers like Ms Voelker while promoting the chauvinist 
ideals' it is said to hold.

This month -- one year after the first lawsuit -- she was laid off as part of a 'reduction in force.'

She said she was the only person in her 500-strong unit to be let go by the bank.

'I worked extremely hard and, as a working mom, I sacrificed so much. I just wanted to be treated equally and no different than my male colleagues,' Ms Voelker told ABC News.

According to the filings, Ms Voelker is seeking
compensatory and punitive damages, among other remedies. Ms Voelker 
said she also filed a discrimination case with the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission.

Like
many other lawsuits alleging gender bias on Wall Street, the complaint 
also provides illustrations of alleged 'hostile and degrading' conduct 
by bank employees to women.

In one instance, at a 2009 meeting where Ms Voelker questioned a decision by a supervisor, her boss said: 'I'd watch your step - she's pregnant,' the complaint said.

The law firm Thompson Wigdor represents Ms Voelker. That firm also represents Nafissatou Diallo, a hotel maid who accused former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn in a civil lawsuit of attempting to rape her. Criminal sexual assault charges against Strauss-Kahn were dropped last month.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc last November settled a lawsuit, also filed by Thompson Wigdor, by a former vice president who said the bank unlawfully fired her while she was on maternity leave.

Last month, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan dismissed an EEOC lawsuit accusing financial news company Bloomberg LP of a pattern of discrimination against pregnant women and mothers returning from maternity leave, even if there were cases of individual bias. Bloomberg said that lawsuit lacked merit.
