Taxpayers could be landed with a £10million bill to compensate victims of ‘fatal’ Government delays in handling ash dieback disease.

More than 100,000 ash saplings have been destroyed in recent weeks, while the import and movement of the trees has also been banned, leaving nursery stock effectively worthless.

One nursery is suing the Government for £200,000, while the horticultural trade body says more legal action will follow unless ministers offer adequate compensation to all its affected members.

Scientists have warned the killer fungus – chalara fraxinea – could wipe out almost all of Britain’s 80 million ash trees within a generation, with new cases now confirmed in Kent and Essex woodland for the first time.

The number of confirmed sites has risen by more than 50 per cent since the weekend, up from 52 to 82.

Martin Ward, chief plant health officer at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), yesterday acknowledged that ‘we are probably not going eradicate’ the disease.

There is increasing anger among plant wholesalers over the Government’s failure  to offer them any financial support, despite warnings from the Horticultural Trade  Association as early as 2009 that action  was needed to prevent dieback from spreading.

The trade body claims the Government initially misdiagnosed the disease, believing it to be the same as one already present in Britain.

Tim Briercliffe, director of business development at the HTA, said the delay seemed to ‘ignore common sense’ and warned that it would consider legal action if no compensation was offered.

He said: ‘Nurseries and tree growers have £10million of ash that will either be destroyed or no longer has a market.

'We want the Government to come forward and acknowledge this is a specific case and offer some form of compensation.

‘We asked them to do something as long ago as 2009, and they didn’t. The fault lies at their door for not acting soon enough.

‘If no financial package is offered, then we would be forced to take legal action on behalf of the trade.’

One plant nursery forced to destroy 50,000 ash trees said it would be suing the Government for more than £200,000.

Simon Ellis, managing director of Crowders Nurseries in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, said it took the Government three months to tell him what to do after finding trees at the nursery were infected in June.

‘There have been instances, such as foot and mouth, where farmers have been compensated for their loss of stock,’ he said.

‘But despite the Government failing to heed the warnings, we are being asked to foot the bill for the damage done.

‘We have had to uproot and destroy stock which we’ve been growing for six years.

'If they had listened to us in 2009 and acted we wouldn’t have this situation now.’

A Defra spokesman said: ‘It is  our view that resources are best spent on surveillance and other preventative disease management activities.’

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson will chair a summit on ash dieback tomorrow, and is holding twice daily meetings to discuss the problem with experts.

He warned that more cases are expected.
