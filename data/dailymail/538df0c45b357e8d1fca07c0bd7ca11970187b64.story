Liverpool's players ensured Brendan Rodgers' reputation for encouraging possession football received a timely boost against Bournemouth as they put together a stunning 51-pass move for their opening goal of the game.

Raheem Sterling, playing as a central striker in the absence of Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert, finished off the slick spell of possession, nodding Jordan Henderson's headed cross into the bottom left corner and out of the reach of Artur Boruc.

But more impressive than the 20-year-old's diving header was the passing which preceded it. The Cherries simply couldn't get near the ball.

Defender Kolo Toure, back in the starting XI after beginning Sunday's 3-0 defeat by Manchester United on the bench, began by giving the ball to Steven Gerrard.

The Reds skipper moved it on to Dejan Lovren, who in turn found his defensive partner Martin Skrtel as the Championship side scurried around trying to win back the ball.

Little did Eddie Howe's men know, this would be the start of a special passage of play which would last almost two-and-a-half minutes and give the Merseysiders the lead in their Capital One Cup quarter-final.

Adam Lallana, Lucas Leiva, Philippe Coutinho, Lazar Markovic, Henderson and goalscorer Sterling were all involved in the build-up, before the England man finished off the move with aplomb.

In total Rodgers' side completed 51 passes prior to Sterling's finish. And before a tackle from Dan Gosling which broke to the feet of Toure to start the move, the Reds completed another 21.

Not bad for a side short on confidence against the Championship leaders.
