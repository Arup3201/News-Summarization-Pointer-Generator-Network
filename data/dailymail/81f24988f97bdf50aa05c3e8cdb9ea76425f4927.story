A pilot and his wife died when a light aircraft ‘dropped out of the sky’ and crashed into a field just yards from the busy M1 yesterday.

Drivers watched in horror as the plane narrowly avoided hitting the M1 in Nottinghamshire, between junctions 26 and 27, at around 1.30pm today.

Police, firefighters, paramedics, an air ambulance and a specialist rescue unit were called to the scene just off the southbound carriageway and the motorway was closed for around an hour.

It is understood that the married couple who were killed lived locally.

A light areoplane with two people on board crashed near to the M1 in Nottinghamshire at 1.30pm today

A shocked driver told how the pilot of the small red and white plane appeared to steer his plummeting aircraft out of the way of the motorway in Nottinghamshire as it came down then burst into flames.

Craig Wing, 31, from Clifton, Nottinghamshire, said he was approaching junction 27 when he noticed the aircraft was in trouble.

Mr Wing turned off at the next junction, got out of his car and ran back to help.

He added: 'It lost control and it just dipped straight down. He (the pilot) managed to swerve from the M1 and into the field.

'It wasn't nice, my kids were very upset, saying Dad we've got to go and help these people.

'It
 nosedived, the pilot managed to get the aircraft off the M1 into the 
field on the right hand side. It wasn't a very nice view.

'I
 ran through the fields to the aircraft. It went down very close to the 
motorway, I would say half the size of a football field away.

'I rang the police straight away and pulled over. Two other gentlemen were also on their way over to help.

Emergency services rushed to the scene near junction 26 of the busy motorway. Nottinghamshire police confirmed there were two casualties in the crash - but the extent of their injuries is unknown

'The police, the ambulance and the fire crew were all first-class, amazing response.'

Pilots wrote online that they believed the plane was a 42-year-old Cessna owned by the Merlin Flying Club, which operates out of Hucknall Airfield.

The small airfield is less than a mile from the M1 between junctions 26 and 27, near the crash site.

A representative of the airfield declined to comment on the crash and told MailOnline all enquiries should be directed to Rolls-Royce, which owns the airfield.

Rolls-Royce did not immediately return requests for comment.

An East Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman declined to give any details as to the seriousness of the victims' injuries, saying: 'I'm acting under police instructions.'

Nottinghamshire police confirmed last night two people on the plane had died.

A police spokesman said: 'Two men have died after a plane in which they were travelling came down in a field near the M1 at around 1.30pm today.

'There are only believed to have been two people in the plane when it came down clear of the motorway near Junction 26.'
