A grandmother of five who won £2million on the lottery has finally retired from her job as a baker - eight months after hitting the jackpot.

Jean Swatman, of Lowestoft, Suffolk, had previously insisted on rising at 5.20am every day to bake doughnuts at her local Morrisons store.

But the 63 year old - who believes she made 1.5million doughnuts in her career - has finally quit her £6-an-hour job and hung up her apron for good, following constant nagging from her family.

She said: ‘I really enjoyed my job but I’m enjoying retirement as a Lotto millionaire a whole lot more.

‘Everybody was telling me to retire but it was the thought of 5.30am winter starts scraping ice off the car that finally made me take the plunge and I haven’t looked back.

‘The main difference since winning has been the fact that I have no worries, but I have not really changed. Since I retired I haven’t had time to miss work really - and I have enjoyed the lie-ins.

‘I haven’t made a doughnut since I retired and I don’t miss making them. I will always buy a packet when I go into the store but they are not the same as mine. Nobody made them better than me.

‘My nails have got really long since and I have always wanted them to be painted and shaped. I always wanted to have them done properly but my work never let me.’

One member of staff at the Morrisons bakery, who worked alongside Jean for three years, said she was a ‘lovely lady’.

She told MailOnline: ‘Jean worked here for so long but she still loved making the doughnuts for everyone.

‘When she left she had a big party at her house and she even bought everyone in the department a bottle of wine and some chocolates.

‘You wouldn't have known she'd won the lottery - she still came in at 6 every morning and worked really hard. I think she was a bit sad to quit after so long - but who could blame her?’

Mrs Swatman, whose lorry driver husband Ben, 50, passed away six years ago, matched six numbers with a lucky dip ticket winning her £2,021,379.

She had the golden ticket in her purse for more than 24 hours before checking - and then assumed the number must be wrong. But she checked with friends who confirmed she was a millionaire.

As well as a bit of pampering Mrs Swatman has got used to spending some of her winnings by helping her family get on the property ladder.

Mrs Swatman has bought the old homes of her brother and daughter in a bid to help them move house.

She has filled her time painting and decorating the new properties with her own hands while she rents out the pair’s former homes at knock down prices to younger members of the family.

But the grandmother herself still lives 
in the modest three-bedroom terraced house in Lowestoft, which she 
bought with her late husband more than two decades ago.

Since her win she has redecorated the whole house and had a new kitchen fitted, but she insists she has no plans to move.

Mrs Swatman also paid off her mortgage and took an exotic trip to Cambodia to visit her son Wayne, 46, who now lives in South-East Asia.

But instead of a supercar the thrifty grandmother spent just £20,000 on her Vauxhall SUV.

Mrs Swatman added: ‘I bought my daughter’s old house so she could afford to move into her new place. I rent that out now. I like decorating it myself, I like to see the result when it’s all finished.

‘I also bought my brother’s bungalow because he wanted to downsize and couldn’t sell his house. I am still in the same house. I have lived her for 20 years and I like living here, I like the neighbours.

‘I have redecorated it all and fitted a new kitchen but I didn’t want to leave it.’

A Morrisons spokesman said: ‘We are delighted for Jean - and after over 10 years’ service with Morrisons, we wish her a long and happy retirement.’
