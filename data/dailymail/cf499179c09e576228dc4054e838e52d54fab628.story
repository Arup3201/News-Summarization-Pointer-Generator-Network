When Jack Nowell was told by Stuart Lancaster and his medical staff he risked being exposed as a one-trick pony if he didn’t undergo surgery, the young Exeter Chief hardly had a leg to stand on.

Following five years of playing with pain in his left knee because of a chronic condition developed as a teenager, things got so bad that muscle started to wither and opponents began to take note.

The 21-year-old has enjoyed a new lease of life following surgery which has finally enabled him to deliver a pain-free performance on two legs instead of one.

England coach Stuart Lancaster had warned Nowell that he could turn into a one-trick pony without treatment

‘I’ve had a patellar tendinitis problem since I was 15,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘It was a big problem but I just cracked on hoping it would go away. It never did.

‘Being a youngster you think no-one will notice but with the amount of analysis that goes on now it was only a matter of time before I was sussed out. It was getting pretty obvious.

‘I got to the end of last season and the physios and Stuart just said, “There’s no way you can carry on like this”.

‘I could feel a massive difference straight away (after surgery). I’m over the moon with how it’s gone. It’s made a massive difference.’

His performances after making his comeback caught Lancaster’s eye, with England’s head coach calling him into the squad for the autumn series.

‘He said he’d been impressed by how quickly I’d recaptured my form,’ Nowell said. ‘That was good to hear from him.

‘It’s been an incredible year but hopefully there’s more to come. Every player in England has an eye on the World Cup.’
