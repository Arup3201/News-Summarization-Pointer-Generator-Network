France's embassy in Tripoli has been hit by what appeared to be a car bomb this morning, injuring two guards.

It was the first assault on a diplomatic mission in Tripoli, considered safer than the rest of the North African country, since the end of the 2011 war that ousted Muammar Gaddafi, leaving Libya awash with weapons and roaming armed groups.

There have been several attacks on diplomatic missions, notably in the eastern city of Benghazi, where the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed last September.

Attack: France's embassy in Libya was hit by an apparent car bomb, injuring two French guards and bringing violence to the capital after attacks on foreign missions in the east

Tension: It is the first such attack in the Libyan capital since the 2011 war that ousted former dictator Muammar Gaddafi

Explosion: Residents living near the embassy compound, in the capital's Hay Andalus area, said they heard two blasts early in the morning around 0700 a.m. (0500 GMT

U.S. officials say militants with ties to al Qaeda were mostly likely involved in that attack but no-one has claimed it.

Al Qaeda's north African arm AQIM has
 warned of retaliation for France's intervention in Mali but there was 
no indication as to who was behind Tuesday's explosion at the embassy in
 Libya.

Residents living near the embassy 
compound, in the capital's Hay Andalus area, said they heard two blasts 
early in the morning around 0700 a.m. (0500 GMT).

A large chunk of the wall around the 
compound collapsed into rubble and one corner of the embassy building 
had caved in. Office cabinets lay scattered on the ground outside and 
water from a burst pipe ran down the street.

Cause: 'We think it was a booby trapped car,' a French embassy official

Destruction: A damaged car is seen near the French embassy in Tripoli

Residents pointed to shrapnel 
belonging to the car they said had exploded, such as a distorted wheel 
axle and pieces of the motor lying on the ground.

'We think it was a booby trapped 
car,' a French embassy official told Reuters. 'There was a lot of damage
 and there are two guards wounded.'

French President Francois Hollande condemned the attack.

'France expects the Libyan 
authorities to shed light on this unacceptable act so that the authors 
are identified and brought to justice,' he said in a statement.

Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius will travel to Tripoli on Tuesday, an official from his ministry said.

The Libyan army cordoned off the 
compound as dozens gathered outside. An embassy employee arrived at the 
scene and burst into tears when she saw the destruction. She was let 
inside to join colleagues and French security staff.

One resident living less than 100 metres from the embassy said his windows shook when the first blast occurred.

'I was in my house sleeping, when I 
was woken up by a long explosion. I went to my front door and found that
 it had blasted out,' Osama al-Alam, lives next door to the embassy, 
said.

'I went into the street and saw smoke everywhere. We heard shooting and went inside the house.'

His own house was badly damaged. Two 
cars outside the embassy were burnt out, others damaged. Parts of 
neighbouring homes were charred and damaged, their own front walls 
reduced to rubble. A palm tree in one front garden had fallen onto a 
roof.

'I think there were two blasts, the 
first was very loud and then there was a smaller one,' another witness 
said. 'There was some black smoke at first, and then it turned white.'

On Sept. 11, 2012 Libyan rebels attacked the US Consulate in the city of Benghazi, killing four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens

Killed: U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens was killed when the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked on September 11, 2012

Security remains precarious in post-war Libya, where militias often do as they please.

The bombing of the U.S. mission in Benghazi followed attacks on British, Red Cross and United Nations interests in the city.

Most foreign embassy staff and 
international aid workers have strict security in Tripoli and Benghazi 
remains off-limits to many foreigners.

Western countries have warned of 
growing militancy in North Africa following the deaths of at least 38 
hostages in an attack on Algeria's In Amenas gas complex near the Libyan
 border in January, and the start of French military operations in Mali.

Al Qaeda's north African arm AQIM 
said on Friday it would retaliate after France sent troops to help 
Malian forces drive back an offensive by Islamist militants who had 
seized two-thirds of the country in the desert north.

'God willing, you shall see what will
 happen,' AQIM's spokesman said in a twitter response to reporters on 
whether it planned future attacks on France.

'Repelling France's aggressive assault is an obligation of every Muslim not just al Qaeda.'
