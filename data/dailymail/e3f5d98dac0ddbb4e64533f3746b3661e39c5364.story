Basketball players are known for being tall, but even among giants this 18-year-old player manages to stand out.

Prep player Tacko 'Taco' Fall is 7ft 5in tall, which would make him the tallest player in the NBA if he signed up today, topping Oklahoma City centre Hasheem Thabeet by two inches.

He wears size 22 shoes - the same as Shaquille O'Neal - eats entire pizzas covered with chicken and hamburger to keep his 18-stone weight up, and has an 8ft wingspan.

He dominates on the court playing for his school, Liberty Christian in Florida, as he barely has to jump in order to make a slam dunk.

He towers over fellow teammates, including Jocques Williams (right), who measures 5ft 11in.

Originally from Dakar, in Senegal, west Africa, it seems height runs in the family. He has a seven-year-old brother who already measures 5ft 9in and two uncles who stand 6ft 8in tall.

While his height makes him unstoppable on the court, Tacko's stature does present problems away from competitions.

Mandy Wettstein, part of Tacko's host family in the US, told the Orlando Sentinel: 'Sometimes, we have to ask people to give him a little space, because no matter where he goes, he attracts a crowd.

'For his birthday we were thinking about taking him to Disney. Then we were thinking, "Is that something he can enjoy or we can enjoy as a family unit with the attention he draws?"'

Having little or no basketball experience before he arrived at the school - where he hit his head on a ceiling fan on his first visit - the player has had a solid season, and is seen as a project by his coach Paul Archer.

Speaking to the Orlando Sentinel, he said: 'Kids from Senegal tend to be passive. You have to get them to understand the American way of playing basketball.

'One thing we need to do is get him in the weight room and get him stronger.'

Tacko landed in Florida after being spotted at the Flyingstar basketball academy in his home country.

For his own part, Fall hopes to play basketball in the NBA and eventually become a biochemist.

He dominates his school league, as he barely has to jump into order to slam dunk. He also has a seven-year-old brother who measures 5ft 9in and two uncles who top out at 6ft 8in

Taco, whose full name is Elhadji Serigne Tacko Diop Fall, said: 'Everywhere I go people are going to be scared because I'm tall.

'But if I don't play like a big man they may not be scared of me and will think I'm soft.

'So I have to play like a big man, be aggressive on the post, ask for the ball and work on my hook shot.'
