Shamed TV presenter Stuart Hall is to be stripped of his OBE admitting a series of indecent assaults against girls as young as nine.

The former It's A Knockout was jailed for 15 months in June but after widespread public outrage over the 'unduly lenient' prison term, his sentence was doubled at the Court of Appeal.

He was awarded the OBE just last year for his services to television and charity but an official announcement that the Queen has revoked the honour is expected to be published in the London Gazette this afternoon.

Disgrace: Former TV presenter Stuart Hall is to be stripped of his OBE following his jailing for indecently assaulting girls as young as nine

In April his son Daniel said it 'would not be fair' for Hall to lose his OBE.

'My father's massive work for charity for 50 years, for which he was awarded an OBE, and a lifetime of good work should not be whitewashed in one brushstroke,' he added.

Hall and his family were leading fundraisers in the North-West and MPs signed a motion in the House of Commons in 1999 congratulating Hall on four decades in broadcasting.

But Hall was described as an 'opportunist predator' by the Crown Prosecution Service.
