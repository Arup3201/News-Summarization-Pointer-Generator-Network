American Airlines and US Airways have reached a deal with the government that lets the two form the world's biggest airline

A judge refused to block a merger between American Airlines and US Airways on Saturday evening, saying a bankruptcy judge correctly rejected arguments made by a lawyer for some consumers.

San Francisco attorney Joseph Alioto argued that the deal would harm fliers because it would result in less competition and higher prices.

U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska repeatedly noted that his arguments relied on outdated facts, had no evidence to support them and sometimes made no sense.

'There is nothing in the record from 
which I can make a finding that your clients are likely to be 
irreparably injured -- personally,' she said.

American
is owned by AMR Corp. and is based in Fort Worth, Texas. The company 
has said it plans to complete the merger with Tempe, Ariz.-based US 
Airways on Monday.

Preska
said a federal bankruptcy judge was 'correct in all respects' in 
deciding last week to let the merger proceed. She also refused to stay 
the effect of her ruling while Alioto appeals to the 2nd U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals.

Alioto complained Friday to Preska that he'd gotten 'the bum's rush, with all due respect, by the bankruptcy court.'

Deal: Under the proposal, American and US Airways would sell 104 takeoff and landing slots at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, 34 slots at La Guardia Airport in New York

Preska
said Alioto had failed to show consumers would suffer irreparable harm 
or that he was likely to succeed in his effort to temporarily block the 
merger until a trial could be conducted on his antitrust lawsuit.

Lane
said last week that even if Alioto won his lawsuit, he could demand 
additional divestitures by the two airlines but could not wreck the 
merger.

Alioto's case lacked
proof, said Attorney Dan Wall for US Airways Group Inc. 'We're here on 
just attorney argument and rhetoric,' he said

The
merger means American, United, Delta and Southwest will control more 
than 80 per cent of the U.S. market. A series of mergers in the industry
since 2005 has reduced nine big airlines to four

In August, the Justice Department had sued to block the merger, saying it would hurt competition and produce higher prices.

But regulators settled their case in exchange for the airlines' promise to surrender some coveted landing rights at Reagan National near Washington and LaGuardia in New York and a few gates at five other airports.

Competing
low-cost carriers will also be given more access to airports in Boston,
Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and Miami, the government said.

'This
is very good news and we are grateful to all who have made it happen,' 
said Doug Parker, CEO of US Airways, and incoming CEO of the combined 
airline, which will be based in Dallas/Fort Worth and go by the  
American name.

'We are pleased to have this lawsuit behind us and look forward to building the new American Airlines together.'

Under the terms of the settlement, the airlines will divest 52 slot pairs at Reagan and 17 slot pairs at LaGuardia.

The airlines will also surrender two gates each at Boston's Logan airport, O'Hare, Dallas Love Field, Los Angeles and Miami.

'It provides more competition than exists today in this industry,' Baer said. 'That is good news for consumers all across the country who will benefit from more choices and more competitive airfares.'

What next: The settlement still needs to be approved by the Federal District Court in the District of Columbia as well as a judge overseeing American Airlines¿ bankruptcy proceeding. The merger could deal could be done by mid-December

After completion of the required divestitures, the combined company expects to operate 44 fewer daily departures at Reagan and 12 fewer daily departures at LaGuardia than the approximately 290 daily DCA departures and 175 daily LGA departures that American and US Airways operate today.

Parker said the combined airline must still decide which destinations to drop because of the lost slots at Reagan and LaGuardia. But he said they would be announced with enough time for the airlines that acquire the slots to decide whether to continue serving those communities.

'We do indeed serve some communities that it is unlikely will be served by those that pick up these slots,' Parker said.

Tom Horton, CEO of American, said the loss of slots is relatively modest, totaling about 15% of the combined airlines' slots at Reagan and 7% at LaGuardia.

But the airlines said the changes wouldn't reduce total employment at the new company.

'This is an important day for our customers, our people and our financial stakeholders,' Horton said. 'This agreement allows us to take the final steps in creating the new American Airlines.'

Saving the day: America West bought out US Airways in 2005. The airline was days away from being liquidated. America West CEO Doug Parker headed up the new airline, a post he still has to this day and will continue with the new American Airlines

End result: After completion of the divestitures, the combined carrier expects to operate 44 fewer daily departures at DCA and 12 fewer daily departures at LGA. Today, the airlines operate 290 and 175 flights respectively at those airports

To maintain its service to small and medium-size airports that US Airways warned might suffer from a reduction in slots at Reagan and LaGuardia, the combined company announced plans to use its gates at Reagan to serve those communities.

Another part of the settlement also committed the combined American to maintain its hubs in Charlotte, New York's JFK, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago O'Hare, Philadelphia and Phoenix.

For a period of five years, the merged company will continue daily service from those hubs to each of the states participating in the lawsuit: Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Tennessee and Virginia.

Delta Air Lines issued a statement welcoming the agreement and saying the airline 'looks forward to the opportunity to acquire slots that will be divested under the agreement, particularly at Washington-Reagan National Airport.'

Delta said it is the airline best positioned to continue competitive non-stop flights from Reagan to small and midsize cities that could otherwise see service reduced or eliminated.
