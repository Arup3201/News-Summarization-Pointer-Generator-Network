Stabbed to death: The killers of Zac Olumegbon have been caged for 76 years for the gang attack

A knife-wielding gang of teenagers stabbed a rival boy to death in a vicious revenge attack as he made his way into school.

The killers were all members of the notorious GAS gang - short for 'Guns and Shanks', and set-upon Zac Olumegbon, 15, as he arrived at the school gates.

The youths wanted revenge on the TN1 'Trust No-One', which Zac was linked to, after another stabbing a month earlier.

On the day of the killing all five 
turned up at Park Campus school in West Norwood, south London, and 
chased their victim armed with two knives.

Kyle
Kinghorn, 18, and Helder Demorais, Jamal Moore and Ricardo Giddings, 
all 17, chased Zac into a nearby garden and stabbed him to death.

All four were convicted of murder after a two-month trial at the Old Bailey last month.

Get
away driver Shaquille Haughton, 16, was cleared of murder but was 
convicted of manslaughter and was sentenced to a 12-year sentence.

In court it was revealed before stabbing Zac all but Moore had been in trouble with the police for carrying knives.

Yesterday at the Old Bailey Giddings, the knifeman who struck the fatal blow, was jailed for 18 years.

Kinghorn and Demorais were each jailed for a minimum 16 years and Moore was given at least 14 years.

Describing the day of the murder Prosecutor Ed Brown QC told the court: 'Before he was able to start his school day he found himself hounded down and killed by these five defendants, armed as they were with at least two large knives.

'As he ran from them Zac was separated from his school friends, he was chased, caught and stabbed to death.

Zac was knifed in the heart, neck and 
buttock and left dying in the back garden of a house just 100 metres 
from the school on July 2.

All five each originally denied being at the scene of the killing, but subsequently four accepted being present after police found their fingerprints and Zac's blood in the get away car, a stolen Nissan Almera.

A second boy was also stabbed and was 'lucky' not to have suffered fatal injuries.

Zac, from Brixton Hill, was a member of the TN1 'Trust No-One' gang from the Tulse Hill.

In June 2010 Zac was said to be present when a member of TN1 stabbed a member of the Gas gang.

Pupils at Park Campus had either been excluded from other schools or were waiting for a place at a mainstream school.

One of the killers used Zac's mobile phone 28 minutes after the stabbing.

Jailing the gang, who are all from 
south London, Judge Giles Forrester said the attacks were 'vicious, 
shocking and sickening acts of violence outside a school in West Norwood
at a time when pupils and staff were gathering at the start of the 
school day'.

He added: 'All of you had chosen to be there probably in a misguided attempt to look big in front of other gang members.

'Zac was aged 15 years, he was chased 
along the street as he fled for his life. He was trapped in a nearby 
back garden and stabbed to death which was a terrifying and terrible way
for him to die,' said the judge.

Moore was a promising grime artist, known as J-kid or Younger Sneaky, who had posted videos on YouTube under the GAS gang name.

Some of the footage, which includes 
the sound of shots being fired, shows hooded and masked youths making 
gun symbols with their hands as he raps lyrics.

Houghton was jailed for eight years for manslaughter and four years consecutively for wounding with intent.

Outside the court, Zac's mother Shakira Olumegbon tearfully told of her grief as she watched the last moments of her son's life played out on CCTV footage during the trial.

Surrounded by family members, she said: 'This has been an extremely painful process for us as family, who had to witness the last moment of Zac's life lived out on screen, all the while fighting the urge to reach out into the screen and help him as he ran for his life.

'We had to listen to the gut-wrenching detail of his injuries, knowing he suffered an extremely painful death that no one should have to endure, let alone a 15-year-old boy.

'Now he's gone we will never be the same. There will always be something missing. He was such a lovely boy and we bitterly regret the cruel way in which he was taken from us.'While there is great satisfaction that justice has finally been achieved there is no sense of victory or conclusion because nothing will ever bring Zac back.'
