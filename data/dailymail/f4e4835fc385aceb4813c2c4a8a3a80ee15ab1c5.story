Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius said Thursday that 7.5 million Americans had enrolled in Obamacare insurance coverage by the time the dust settled on April 1, but reused to tell senators how many of them were already covered before the law took full effect.

The question is an important one: Republicans claim that most of those who signed up are Americans who lost their existing policies in 2013 because they didn't meet the Affordable Care Act's strict and sometimes bewildering minimum standards.

President Barack Obama promised that his signature insurance overhaul law would dramatically reduce the ranks of the uninsured. Democrats hope the numbers turn out to show he's delivered on that pledge.

'I do not have data to give you right now in terms of who exactly was previously uninsured,' Sebelius told Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch during a Senate Finance Committee hearing focused on her agency's 2015 budget request.

Deer, meet headlights: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius couldn't answer the thorny question of how many Obamacare enrollees already had insurance before the Affordable Care Act kicked in

Delivering? President Barack Obama, shown Thursday speaking at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library, has promised for years that his signature health insurance law would insure everyone, or nearly everyone, in America

She said HHS is still collecting that data from insurance companies since it has no way of tracking the previous insurance status of individual enrollees.

It's possible that both sides could be right on the question of the law's impact.

A RAND Corporation report released days ago estimates that 9.3 million people are newly insured since the Obamacare law kicked in.

But a large majority of those gains are due to Americans who received new coverage from their employers, not through the government-run insurance exchanges.

And RAND concluded that some of the uptick was due to the normal churn of the industry, which sees new insurance customers entering the marketplace and others dropping out every month.

The report also found that 5.2 million Americans lost their coverage in the wake of the Affordable Care Act's calamitous fall rollout.

Sebelius touted RAND's 9.3 million statistic in her testimony on Thursday.

Hatch insisted that her claimed pool of 7.5 million enrollees will inevitably shrink once people are challenged to pay for their new medical insurance, likening it to some online shopping that stops before getting to a virtual checkout.

'Indeed, it's like Amazon.com taking stock of how many people have placed items in their shopping carts and then counting them as sales,' he said. 'In other words it’s a false metric.' 

Fair question: Sen. Orrin Hatch (L) asked Sebelius what the net effect of Obama has been -- not just how many enrollments governments have seen online

No matter whose version of reality prevails, Democrats face a perception problem and almost certain electoral defeats in September because of the well-publicized problems with the law's rollout, its increased costs and the limited scope of doctor networks in the insurance plans it includes.

The Pew Research Center and USA Today released poll numbers Thursday from April 3-6, showing that 53 per cent of Americans disapprove of the law, while just 41 per cent support it.

And 64 per cent of Republican registered voters said a candidate's position on Obamacare will be 'very important' in their Election Day decisions, compared with only 52 per cent of Democrats.

An editorial writer in Investor's Business Daily claimed Thursday that the Obama administration might be cooking the books.

Using data released by the 14 states – plus the District of Columbia – which run their own exchanges, added to the public totals of seven states that participated in the healthcare.gov exchange, the paper's John Merline determined that Sebelius' number could only be correct if 29 states added nearly 2 million Obamacare enrollees in March alone.

That metric would represent 'an eye-popping 90% increase in just the last month,' he wrote.
