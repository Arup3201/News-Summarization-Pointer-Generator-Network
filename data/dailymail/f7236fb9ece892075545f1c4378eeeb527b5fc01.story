It was reported earlier this month that Ricky Hatton had moved out of his family home for the second time after an argument with fiance Jennifer Dooley.

However the boxer looked to have put his recent troubles behind him as he partied with a group of topless, and bikini-clad women, in Marbella on Thursday.

The 35-year-old was even treated to a massage by one of his companions as he soaked up the sun with pals at the Spanish resort's Ocean Club.

Sangria time: The boxer appeared to be enjoying a tipple during his break in the Spanish resort

There was no sign of his other half as he reclined on a lounger, while sipping on a drink and flashing his numerous tattoos.

The father-of-three opted for a simple, long pair of black trunks, complete with red logos, which he teamed with a chunky gold watch and bracelets.

He kept his dark aviators firmly on as he sat next to the swimming pool, however didn't appear to feel the need to take a dip despite the sunny weather.

Ricky 
appeared to be oblivious to the topless female sat next to him as he 
chatted to a brunette, who was sporting a pink two-piece.

During his day out, Ricky flexed his muscles as he posed for a snap with a leggy fan before reclining on a deck chair.

He
 tweeted his 396,000 followers the following day to say: 'Great to see 
old pals @mattmacklin @Seamo89 and what a place to train @MGM_Marbella 
first class'.

His outing comes less than two weeks after he reportedly moved out of his £3million family home for a second time.

The
 former two-weight world champion allegedly had a bust-up with Jennifer 
during a holiday in Tenerife with their children, Millie, two, 
and ten-month-old Fearne.

He had 
flown to Lanzarote to watch a boxing fight, but 'went off the radar' 
after going out for a drink, a source told Richard Moriarty of The Sun.

He
 eventually showed up at the family mansion in Hyde, Greater Manchester,
 two days later, where he was greeted by his 'furious' fiancé.

'Jennifer stood at the airport desperately ringing his mobile,' said the unnnamed source. 'She was humiliated and furious.'

Last
 month, Hatton, who received an MBE in 2010, returned to the family 
home after moving out last December following another row with Jennifer.
