A star-studded  advert on how to help a choking baby has been credited with saving the lives of 12 children.

The advert by St John Ambulance features the voices of David Walliams as a fairy princess and Sir John Hurt as a peanut, and warns of the risk posed to youngsters by everyday objects.

Since The Mail on Sunday first reported on the advert's launch, it has been seen by 20 million people.

So far 12 families have contacted the charity to say using the correct technique – five back blows followed by up to five chest thrusts – had saved their child.

Hannah Gilmartin, who found her 11-month-old daughter choking on a tealight candle, says: 'I'm just so grateful I saw the advert – it saved her life.'

The advert followed the launch of this year's St John Ambulance's Everyday Heroes awards. Run in association with The Mail on Sunday, they honour those who have saved lives using first aid.

A new cycling jacket lets riders 'indicate' like a car. The Visijax (£99.99, halfords.com) uses motion-sensor technology to activate in-built lights that signal to motorists when the wearer is about to make a turn. 

Rechargeable LED amber lights are triggered for five seconds when the rider raises an arm to indicate, allowing them to replace their hands on the handlebars quickly and concentrate on the road

Cheska's slim look is Made in Spain 

They say the camera adds 10lb – but in the case of Made In Chelsea's Cheska Hull, it was almost two stone. Constant socialising and drinking champagne on the E4 reality series left her tipping the scales at nearly 11½ st.

Now, after a week-long detox regime at a Spanish spa resort where she lived on vegetable juices, plus a more balanced diet and exercise programme, Cheska weighs under 10st.

'I used to think that if you wanted to lose weight, you had to spend hours on the treadmill,' she says.

'But I've learned you can mix it up so now I swim about three times a week. I also eat fewer carbs and more vegetables and snack on things like avocados and almonds instead of crisps and snack bars.'

Doctors  want volunteers to drink and be merry for a study into whether 'beer goggles' really exist. Researchers need 60 people for the project which looks at how drinking affects our ability to read emotion in the facial expressions of others. 

The Swiss team will also examine how alcohol affects moods by measuring the blood of drinkers for levels of oxytocin, the so-called 'cuddle hormone' which is believed to reduce social inhibitions.
