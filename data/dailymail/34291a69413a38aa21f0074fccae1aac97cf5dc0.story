The FA has given Wigan chairman Dave Whelan an extra week to respond to his misconduct charge.

The 78-year-old last month allegedly made remarks about Chinese and Jewish people in response to criticism of the club's decision to appoint Malky Mackay as the Latics' new manager.

Whelan publicly apologised for the comments attributed to him in the Guardian and also suggested he may have been misquoted, yet was still charged by football's governing body.

The Wigan owner had until 6pm on Friday to respond to the charge, but the FA has now granted him a week's extension.

The FA announced on Twitter: 'Following a request by Dave Whelan, The FA has granted him an extension to the date by which he had to reply to his misconduct charge for media comments.

'The Wigan Athletic chairman now has until 6pm on Friday 12 December 2014 to respond to the charge.'

The Guardian reported that Whelan said 'Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else' and, when asked about Mackay's past indiscretions, replied by saying it was 'nothing' to call a Chinese person a 'chink'.

Cardiff owner Vincent Tan, who sacked Mackay last December, branded his Wigan counterpart a 'racist', telling the BBC that this is a case of a 'racist chairman hiring a racist manager'.

Whelan has said he would resign if the FA 'even suggest I'm guilty' of making racist remarks.

The former Blackburn and Crewe player bought his hometown club in February 1995, overseeing an incredible rise from Division Three to win last year's FA Cup.

Wigan currently sit 23rd in the Championship standings and have yet to win since Mackay's appointment.

The FA's investigation into Mackay's actions during his Cardiff tenure is ongoing.
