Lee and Clare True pictured on their wedding day - shortly after this picture was taken the car they were driving was crushed by a tree

A newlywed couple escaped after a 30ft tree toppled into the road and crushed their car as they drove to their wedding reception.

Lee and Clare True were driving away from the wedding when fierce winds brought the enormous tree crashing onto their Peugeot 206.

The car immediately buckled under the force, crushing the roof, smashing the windscreen and back window, and activating the airbags.

Miraculously Lee, 36, and Clare, 40, only suffered minor injuries, while Lee’s two children James, seven and Charlie, five, and their dog Tilly, walked away completely unharmed.

Lee, an IT programmer, said: 'What was supposed to be one of the happiest days of our lives turned out to be the day we could have lost them.

'It was just unbelievable. There was this massive explosion, a big flash, sparks everywhere. the airbags went off and the glass shattered.

'The car immediately stopped and the engine cut out and we were plunged into darkness. The car was full of smoke, we didn’t know what had happened.

'My first thought was to get the wife and children out but I couldn’t open my door, it was jammed.

'When I finally managed to get it open I just grabbed the kids, pulled them to safety and put them on the side of the road.

'We were driving at 50mph and the tree came right on top of us, we couldn’t see it anywhere.

'It is very hard to explain, you read it all the time in newspapers but you don’t think to take notice because you think to yourself ‘it won’t happen to me’.'

Clare, who was driving, added: 'When it happened the roof caved in and the car was full of smoke, as the airbags were deployed, Lee’s door was jammed.

'The greatest wedding gift we could have got was escaping with our lives.'

The freak incident happened after the 
couple tied the knot in front of a handful of family and friends at 
Trowbridge Register Office, Wiltshire, on Valentine’s Day.

They
 then picked up Lee’s children from their mother in Salisbury, 
Wiltshire, and were driving back to the reception at their family home 
in Bradford on Avon, Wilts.

But at around 7.15pm high winds brought the tree crashing down as they drove along the A36 near Warminster.

The shocked family managed to scramble 
free from their battered car and sat on the side of the road in 
torrential rain as around 15 members of the public helped them.

Police and ambulance crews were also called.

Luckily the couple, who have been together five years, had changed out of their wedding clothes into evening wear so were able to free themselves quickly.

Nurse Clare said: 'Everyone was so good to us and we’d like to thank them all.

'In particular we’d like to say thank you to Robert Whitefield from Whitefield Metals, in Westbury, who was one of the first on the scene.

'He stayed with us for two hours and joked he had an excuse to be late for a romantic meal.'
