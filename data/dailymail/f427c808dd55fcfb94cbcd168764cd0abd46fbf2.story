He is believed to be the fastest pigeon in Europe.

And now the champion bird named after the world's fastest man can also lay claim to being the most expensive.

A Chinese millionaire pigeon fancier paid almost £300,000 for the pigeon Bolt.

It followed a huge auction by Belgian owner Leo Heremans, 66, who made an astonishing  £3.8 million after selling his stable of 530 racing pigeons.

The huge internet auction attracted an estimated 300,000 would-be buyers from around the world.

Mr Heremans spent 40 years breeding the birds and is nick-named the pigeon whisperer because of his habit of talking to his birds before a big race.

But he was forced to sell because he has developed a virus caused by constant contact with the pigeons.

'Leo has done so well with his birds this year and there has been a lot 
of hype. That's why he has been able to get so much money. The prices 
have just gone crazy,' said Nikolaas Gijselbrecht, a Belgian who runs 
the world's biggest pigeon web-site, Pigeon Paradise with more than a 
million fans worldwide.

'But he certainly knows his birds. It's true that whispering to the 
pigeons creates a bond and encourages them to fly faster in a race so 
they have a motive to get home quicker.'

Bolt won the Belgian sprint title last year, an achievement which put 
him in the Usain Bolt class. Previously the world record price for a 
single bird, barely a pound of feathers, stood at 250,400 euros which 
was paid in Belgium last year.

'The Chinese know there is one big economic advantage with pigeons,' 
said Yi Manna, chief of the PiPa pigeon auction house which organises 
sales in Belgium. 'A bottle of wine remains one bottle. You have a nice 
pigeon and it will have more children, grandchildren.'

Record-holder: The pigeon is believed to be named after Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, the world's fastest man

Bolt's owner Leo was already a wealthy man before he sold his pigeons. He runs a successful diamond polishing business.

'I am absolutely gobsmacked,' was his only comment after being told how much he was getting for his birds.

Pigeon racing involves releasing specially trained pigeons which then return to their homes over measured distance.

It requires a specific breed of pigeon, called the 'Racing Homer'.

The sport has always been popular in Belgium, achieving great popularity in the mid 19th Century.
