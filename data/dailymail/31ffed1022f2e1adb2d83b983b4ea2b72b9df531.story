For a Scottish climbing challenge that goes a bit beyond the natural beauty of the Cairngorns, look no further than the train.

Visitors to Edinburgh could be able to don hard hats and carabinas to scale one of the most iconic monuments in the country - the Forth railway bridge.

Network Rail is planning to offer guided tours to the top of the bridge in time for its 125th anniversary in 2015.

Groups of 15 people would be taken from South Queensferry along an existing walkway under the approach span close to Dalmeny Station.

Wearing the requisite safety gear, they would climb to the top of the south tower, where a small bridge has been proposed.

The railway authority has also proposed a second concept for less adventurous climbers that includes a visitors' centre and viewing platform linked by a lift on the north side, which would take groups to the top of one of the towers more than 100 metres above the Firth of Forth.

A video outlining the proposals suggests a glass-ceiling centre could be tucked under the massive steel structure at North Queensferry, opening up a 'cathedral-like' view above.

The proposals would costs an estimated £12-15 million to deliver and could be 'partially realised' within two years, Network Rail said.

To scale: A second plan would allow visitors to do more challenging walks from a smaller base to the top of the south tower

David Simpson, route managing director at the rail authority, said: 'After 10 years spent restoring the bridge to its full glory, and in advance of the application for world heritage listing, these plans will offer the public the chance to visit the bridge and see it close-up for the first time.

'We are hugely excited by these proposals and believe that they have the potential to be developed into an important new visitor attraction for Scotland.'

Network Rail said the visitor attraction could be developed without any serious changes to 'the well loved view of the bridge'.

It said the bridge would remain a key part of the railway service, with any profits going to fund its upkeep.

The Forth railway bridge carries more than 200 trains a day between Edinburgh and Fife.

Masterpiece: Designers Sir John Fowler and Benjamin Baker wanted the bridge to look indestructible

Rights of passage: The bridge provided the first non-ferry link between Edinburgh and Fife, linking key cities such as Aberdeen

Iconic: HRH Edward, Prince of Wales, added the final rivet to the structure when it opened on 4 March 1890

Along with the Forth road bridge, it provides the key link between the capital and northern Scotland, including key cities such as Aberdeen.

Mr Simpson said: 'We are committed to working with communities, local authorities and relevant government bodies to develop plans that have a sustainable positive impact on the area.

'While we expect that visitor numbers will be high, we're committed to encouraging as many of those visitors as possible to travel by rail and we will develop plans alongside train operators to incentivise that option.'

Transport Minister Keith Brown, speaking on behalf of the Forth Bridge Forum, said: 'I welcome Network Rail's exciting and ambitious plans to combine an historic and vital part of Scotland's transport network with a breath-taking attraction for visitors to enjoy.'
