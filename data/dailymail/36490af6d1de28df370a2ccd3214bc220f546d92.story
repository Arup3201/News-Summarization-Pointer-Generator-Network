The family of a late Wizard of Oz actor who played a Munchkin in the classic film appeared in St. Louis court on Monday to claim $500,000 back from his former caretaker.

Mickey Carroll's family claim that the hypopituitary dwarf, who died in May 2009 aged 89, was exploited by carer Linda Dodge just before his death.

His nieces and nephews first launched the civil suit in 2011 after discovering that their uncle, who never married or had children, had lost significant assets from his fortune.

'Linda Dodge wormed her way into the life of Mickey Carroll and started to isolate him from other family members,' said the familyâ€™s attorney, Patrick McCarthy, in opening statements according to St. Louis today.

However, Dodge's defense team said that she was the only one who cared for Carroll as his Alzheimer's advanced and brought him to doctor's appointments and even moved him into her home before he died.

'Ms. Dodge genuinely cared for the decedent,' said one of her attorneys, Christopher Blaesing. 'She treated him like family.'

He said the simple explanation for the extravagant spending exhibited by Carroll was because of his generosity.

'He was a small man but he was larger than life when it came to his spending.'

The suit accuses Dodge of getting Carroll, who stood just over three-feet tall and was 18 when he appeared in 1939's The Wizard of OZ, to grant them power of attorney over his affairs.

Carroll's neices and nephew's allege that Dodge, her daughter Wendy Oldham and her husband, George W. Anderson got the munchkin actor to take out a $100,000 line of credit from a bank on his St. Louis house.

His family claimed that prior to this he was frugal and had no debts.

Indeed, five days after taking out his bank loan on January 22, 2009 bank records show that he began to sign checks made out to cash, with the first being for $42, 836.

Then two days after that he signed a check for $27,000 to cash and that same day, another one for $27,000.

Dodge, in an interview with the Post-Dispatch shortly after Carroll died on May 7, 2009, called allegations of missing money 'foolish.'

She said she became Carroll's caretaker in January 2009.

The suit says that 'at a minimum,' a total of $225,071 was embezzled from Carroll's account at Regions Bank.

Carroll's niece, Josephine Romeiser said her uncle was successful as a gravestone and monument maker after his Hollywood career ended.

'If you look up the word entertainer, that was my Uncle Mickey,' she said, according to St. Louis Today.

Carroll was one of more than 100 adults and children who were recruited to play the movie natives of what author L. Frank Baum called Munchkin Country in his 1900 book 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.'

Carroll told The Associated Press in a 2007 interview that the Munchkins made only $125 a week while filming the movie that would become a classic.

'The Wizard of Oz' was Carroll's only movie. When it appeared on television in the 1960s, he found a new career at charitable events, retail events and Oz-related events.

'It's not me; it's the movie,' Carroll said. 'When they see me, they think of their childhood, and it makes them smile.'

Carroll was born Michael Finocchiaro on July 8, 1919, in St. Louis. The son of immigrants, he grew up in an Italian neighborhood on the city's north side with a twin sister and four older siblings. All preceded him in death.

A pituitary condition caused Carroll's short stature. Stephen Cox, a friend of Carroll's and the author of a book on the Munchkins, told the St.Louis Post-Dispatch that Carroll was 4-foot-3 when he stopped growing in his 40s.

Carroll danced at the Muny Theater in St. Louis when he was in grade school, he once said, and in the 1920s worked in Chicago clubs and on the Orpheum Theater vaudeville circuit.

His gift of gab and comedic timing helped his popularity. He warmed up crowds for President Franklin Roosevelt while campaigning in New York City and served as a crowd-getter in President Harry Truman's whistlestop campaign.

He did Phillip Morris live radio ads and appeared in shows with Mae West. He later did radio shows with George Burns, Gracie Allen, Jack Benny and Al Jolson.

But it was his role as one of the 'Oz' Munchkins that defined him.

Carroll played the part of the Munchkinland 'Town Crier,' marched as a 'Munchkin Soldier' and was the candy-striped 'Fiddler' who escorted the movie's wide-eyed orphan, Dorothy Gale, played by Judy Garland, down the yellow brick road toward Emerald City.

In the mid-1940s, Carroll returned to St. Louis to run the family business making cemetery monuments. After he sold it in 1996, he filled his time with charity work, Dodge said.

In November 2007, Carroll and six other surviving Munchkins received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Carroll was joined on that occasion by former Munchkin colleagues Ruth Duccini, Jerry Maren, Margaret Pellegrini, Meinhardt Raabe, Karl Slover and Clarence Swensen. Swensen died in February.

At a special screening of the film in 2005 in Los Angeles, Carroll said talking to longtime fans about the movie brought back their childhoods.

'They have tears,' he said. 'I'll say, 'May the magic of Oz always be with you.' And, 'Follow the yellow brick road!' And they're all excited. I bring back their childhood. Ain't that something?'
