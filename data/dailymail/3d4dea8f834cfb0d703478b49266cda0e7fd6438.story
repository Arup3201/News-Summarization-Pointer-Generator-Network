The rodeo clown behind the President Barack Obama mask that outraged many claims he has received death threats for the ‘joke.’

Tuffy Gessling has received several death threats and was suspended for life from the Missouri State Fair after an August 10 stunt in which he dressed up as the president and was chased by a bull – a routine he says he has done for decades dating all the way back to Ronald Reagan.

‘I didn’t do this to do any hating on anyone,’ Gessling told KCTV, ‘I did it to be funny. I did it to be a joke. This clown bit has been around for generations.’

Not racist: Rodeo clown Tuffy Gessling swears this stunt was not racist

Caught on video and posted to social media, the act went viral and garnered national attention for what many saw was a blatantly racist jab at the nation’s first African-American president, a perception Gessling explained is misguided.

‘I didn’t think anything more of it than what we’ve done 15 years ago, 10 years ago, five years ago when we’ve done it with Bush, Clinton and Ronald Reagan,’ he told the station.

The fallout from the act was swift and brutal – a lifetime ban from the Missouri State Fair, scores of people accusing him of being a racist, criticism from locals, politicians and other celebrities.

‘I’ve had one lady spit in my face, [she] called me a dirty name, spit in my face and walked off,’ the rodeo clown said.

Gessling has even received five death threats.

I’ve had somebody threaten to run me over, one of them wanted to burn the house down,’ a visibly shaken Gessling shared.

The scorned entertainer believes the outrage over the act comes from Americans losing their sense of humor.

‘I actually think that a lot of people have lost their ability to laugh,’ Gessling told the station. Look at this country as a whole, there’s a lot more to be mad at than a rodeo clown, at a rodeo, trying to make somebody laugh.’

The rodeo circuit veteran insisted that he is not racist.

‘I never did anything because of anybody’s race, I don’t care what color somebody is – if they’re blue, white, green, polka dotted, striped, it doesn’t bother me one bit,’ said Gessling.

Gessling told the station that he has received far more support than derision, with celebrities and even a few country music stars sending him their well wishes and support, though he curiously did not name any and none have publicly spoken out in his favor.

Telling the station that he may even do the bit again, Gessling declined to tell the station whether he was a Democrat or Republican, instead saying only ‘I am a rodeo clown.’

The accused racist told the station he has a rodeo coming up in Jefferson City, Missouri and has invited politicians to come out and ask any questions they may have – even President Obama.

‘If President Obama turns out, I’d be honoured to shake his hand.’
