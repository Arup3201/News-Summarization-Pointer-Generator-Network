The News of the World was last night facing a growing backlash from Twitter users who were urging advertisers and readers to abandon the newspaper.

Thousands of Tweets targeted a string of companies who advertise in the shamed paper while others called for a mass boycott.

A number of companies with links to the publication, owned by News International, was published online with furious messages demanding they cut their contacts.

The powerful public backlash came on a day when it emerged that private investigators could have hacked the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.

The paper is said to have intercepted some messages and deleted others. It is said that this activity may have disrupted the police investigation and created false hope that Milly was still alive and had been using her phone.

It is also claimed that they targeted the family of Soham schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman who were killed in 2002.

A senior police detective who had been investigating an unsolved murder with links to the News of the World told Channel 4 that police believe he was also bugged.

After more details of illegal activity emerged, car-maker Ford scrapped its contract with the paper and a number of other companies said they were 'considering' doing the same.

Until now phone hacking allegations had been limited to celebrities and Royal figures.

But the growing public fury over the scandal is the first time that the paper has been alleged to have targeted members of the public and even victims of crime.

Twitter users published a flood of messages urging other household name to abandon the Ruper Murdoch-owned paper.

advertising spend with #notw given that we now know they hacked Milly 
Dowler’s phone?'

Advertisers including @TheCooperative, @easyjet and @VirginMedia are among others who were being contacted by Twitter users.

The power of Twitter was demonstrated last month when Ryan Giggs' super-injunction was virtually overpowered by the strength of thousands of online demands.

A Facebook page has also been launched asking advertisers to boycott the News of the World this Sunday. It has 160 members and it includes links to News of the World advertisers including Tesco and Sainsbury’s.

Halifax, T-Mobile, Npower and Dixons Retail have said they are 'reviewing' their contracts while Virgin Media, Tesco and Brand Alley say they will wait until an investigation is completed. The Co-operative has refused to rule out pulling adverts.

Following the outcry, website Mumsnet have announced that they have cancelled a contract with Sky, and will be removing all News International adverts from their website.

Details of the alleged hacking first emerged on Twitter last night when Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger tweeted: 'News of the World hacked Milly Dowler’s voicemail & deleted messages. Family says ''heinous''.'

The schoolgirl went missing from her home in March 2002 and her body was found six months later. The Soham murders took place in August that year.

Ms Brooks was editor of the News of the World at the time although she denies having any knowledge of illegal phone hacking.

The News International boss' position looked increasingly untenable as both David Cameron and Ed Miliband condemned the alleged hacking of Milly's phone.

The Prime Minister described the allegations as a 'truly dreadful act', while Labour leader Mr Miliband urged Brooks to 'consider her position' and 'examine her conscience'.

Their words were backed by the Dowler family's lawyer Mark Lewis, who said of Ms Brooks's position: 'It is a matter for her own personal conscience to decide.

Meanwhile, John Prescott has called for News Corp's attempts to take full control of BSkyB to be blocked in the wake of the allegations.

The condemnation from Mr Cameron is a major blow to Ms Brooks, who considers him a personal friend.

Both have homes in his Oxfordshire constituency and Mr Cameron visited her as a guest during the Christmas period last year.

Their friendship is one of a number the Prime Minister holds with senior media industry figures who live nearby, including Elizabeth Murdoch and Jeremy Clarkson.

In a letter to staff today, Ms Brooks said she was 'appalled and shocked' by the allegations that a private investigator working for the News of the World hacked into schoolgirl Milly Dowler's phone after she went missing.

She said she has written to Milly's parents, adding that if the accusations are true then it is 'unforgivable'.

In the letter she expressed her determination 'to lead the company to ensure we do the right thing and resolve these serious issues'.

It has been claimed that her parents Bob and Sally Dowler also had their phones hacked by a private detective in the weeks after the 13-year-old disappeared.

In a statement released to the Guardian, Glenn Mulcaire said he had worked under 'relentless pressure' at the Sunday newspaper and there was a 'constant demand for results'.

He said: 'I want to apologise to anybody who was hurt or upset by what I have done.'
