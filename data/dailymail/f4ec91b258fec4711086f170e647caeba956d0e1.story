A study has revealed that emotional attachment is more hurtful than extra-marital sex

Women would rather their partners had a fling than form an emotional bond with another female, according to research.

A recent study found that two-thirds of women said emotional attachment is more hurtful than extra-marital sex.

But for men, just a third said that their partner forming an emotional bond with another man was more painful than having a passionate affair with them.

Four-fifths of women said they would be more jealous of their partner falling in love with someone else than trying different sexual positions with another woman.

While over half of men said the idea of their partner in bed with someone else was a bigger upset.

The American study, which polled 477 adults, was published in the journal Evolutionary Psychology.

The participants were quizzed on different scenarios of emotional and sexual infidelity, and asked which would be more hurtful.

Generally, women found that their partners’ emotional transgressions were more hurtful than cheating on them physically.

It was the opposite for men, with most being more hurt by their partners’ sexual affairs.

When both love and infidelity occurred together it was physical cheating which was overwhelmingly the biggest betrayal for males, but not females.

A third of women said they would be more hurt if their partner was sexually interested in a former lover, than if they became emotionally involved with an old flame.

Again, the opposite was true for men, with the majority being more hurt by any sexual interest with a former partner.

Researchers questioned participants over their own lifestyle, morality, how emotionally close they were with partners, and sexual history.

Lead author Dr Gary Brase, from Kansas State University, said: ‘Males reported that sexual infidelity scenarios were relatively more distressing than emotional infidelity scenarios, and the opposite was true of females.’

Dr Brase said that men and women’s fundamental attitudes were divided.

He said: ‘No factors showed a stronger relationship with reactions to infidelity than participant sex.

‘This research finds no evidence that the specific beliefs about infidelity, sex roles, attachment styles, reported socio-sexual orientation, or cognitive styles are driving the consistent sex differences found in reactions to different types of infidelity scenarios.’

He said there was a long running debate over whether it was nurture or nature that had created such opposing sexual attitudes.

Dr Brase wrote in the journal that evolutionary psychologists believed the difference was down to ‘men facing a problem of paternity uncertainty’.

He continued: ‘Men can never be absolutely certain that an infant carries their genes.

‘This prospect should make men differentially sensitive to sexual infidelity on the part of their mate.

‘Women, on the other hand, confront a different potential problem of ensuring continued paternal investment by the sire of their child.

‘This possibility should make women differentially sensitive to emotional infidelity of their mate.'
