Thousands of USA supporters packed fan parks across the country on Thursday to cheer on the team during their last Group G clash against Germany

With Butler Field in Chicago full of people 15 minutes ahead of the big kick-off, the support Jurgen Klinsmann's side have received from home fans during this tournament shows just how big football is becoming Stateside.

Those packed inside will have been disappointed with the 1-0 defeat at the hands of Germany but will have been delighted to progress after Portugal's 2-1 win over Ghana wasn't enough to see Cristiano Ronaldo and co go through.

For a nation that would usually consider 
the Super Bowl as the competition to decide football's world champions, 
the United States have come a long way in terms of the way they view 
'soccer'.

This 
summer's World Cup in Brazil looks to be the first one that really has 
US fans hooked - a whole 20 years on from when they hosted the 
tournament on their home soil at USA '94.

For
 once, rather than struggling to drum up support for the USMNT (United 
States Men's National Team), fans are being turned away from fan parks 
as Americans attempt to drink in the relative successes of their 
national team on the big stage.

A pre-tournament survey, carried out across 19 Brazil-bound countries, showed US supporters as fans of one of only four nations that expected their team to win the World Cup - alongside early favourites Argentina, Brazil and Spain.

And the 
fans are embracing the success. Over seven years on from when David 
Beckham's move to LA Galaxy heralded a new era - that didn't quite work 
out - for soccer in the world's third largest country by population, 
football, as it is increasingly being referred to, is finally capturing 
the imagination of the fans.

Even the absence of Landon Donovan - considered a national hero in soccer terms - has not dampened the enthusiasm.

Chicago's
 fan park - laid on for the Portugal game - has a 15,000 person capacity
 but had to turn fans away, such was its popularity.

Videos
 of fans celebrating John Brooks' last-gasp winner against Ghana have 
been doing the rounds on YouTube and are on a par with videos of English
 fans reacting to goals - although they have had less to cheer about 
this year.

No country aside from the host nation took up more tickets than the USA's 196,838 for the finals while viewing figures are at an all-time high and beginning to even rival those of America's traditional sports.

While the MLS still does not quite have the same level of popularity at the USMNT - it is improving.

This year's television viewing figures were low but next year Beckham will launch his own new Miami-based MLS side, while David Villa represents arguably the States' biggest coup following his sign for Manchester City's sister club New York City FC. Chelsea legend Frank Lampard might follow the Spanish striker.

Coach Jurgen Klinnsman has penned a letter for fans to print out and hand in at work to help them get the day off for what he calls 'for an important cause'. For supporters in the US, real football is finally becoming important.

USA fans erupted in fan parks and bars when John Brooks scored the winner against Ghana but despaired when Cristiano Ronaldo set up Silvestre Varela to equalise for Portugal and deny them qualification after two games.

A win or draw against Germany would guarantee a place in the next round and might see even more emotional scenes.
