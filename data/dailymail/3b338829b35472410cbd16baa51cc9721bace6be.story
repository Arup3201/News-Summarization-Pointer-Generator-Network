This is the moment David Cameron was shoved by a jogger who sprinted past bodyguards, sparking a major security alert.

Fitness fanatic Dean Farley, 28, charged into the Prime Minister outside Leeds Civic Hall yesterday.

The incident – captured on a bystander’s mobile phone – led to a police protection row as experts accused officers of allowing a ‘very significant security breach’.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan Howe has ordered an investigation as MPs and security experts pointed out that Mr Cameron could have been stabbed or killed. Although he was uninjured, police faced withering criticism.

The footage showed officers pouncing on Mr Farley, and wrestling him to the ground, while Mr Cameron was left ‘vulnerable’ standing alone for a number of seconds before being driven away. 

Tory MP Mark Pritchard called for a full inquiry. ‘Met Police close protection officers are some of the best in the world, but what if the protester had been carrying a knife?’ he said. 

Dai Davies, a former head of royal protection, said police had serious questions to answer about their failures to protect Mr Cameron yesterday.

Cuffed: Farley is arrested but was released 50 minutes later after telling police it was an accident. He claimed that he had just 'brushed into someone' and had no idea that it was Mr Cameron

‘This is a serious breach of security,’ he told the Mail. ‘There should have been a proper formation and a strategy where you have an inner and outer ring of protection officers, with uniformed officers as back-up, acting in a deterrent capacity.

‘If that had happened, this man would have got nowhere near the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister could be in intensive care or worse now. There must be a review of his security and the protection of the senior figures in the Government.’ 

But the runner who sparked the security alert said he didn’t even know it was the Prime Minister he bumped into – and accused police of assault.

Mr Farley claimed he had merely ‘brushed into someone’ and had no idea it was Mr Cameron, who was in Leeds announcing plans to upgrade rail links in the North.

The jogger was arrested and held for 50 minutes before being released. West Yorkshire Police said it was ‘nothing sinister, just a man in the wrong place at the wrong time’.

Chief Inspector Derek Hughes said: ‘No threats were made, and after the man’s details were checked, he was allowed on his way.’

The Prime Minister later made light of the scare, joking about Labour’s former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott, who punched a protester in 2001 who had thrown eggs at him. Mr Cameron said: ‘John Prescott was in the room as I gave the speech so as I left, I thought the moment of maximum danger had probably passed. But clearly that wasn’t the case.’

He said he had confidence in his police bodyguards. But Mr Davis said: ‘I am astonished that given the current threat level, there was a paucity of protection given that he is a worldwide target. If there had been two or more attackers plotting a coordinated attack, the Prime Minister might not be here.

'On the video you can clearly see Mr Cameron is left standing alone completely vulnerable for five to six seconds while all attention was on this man. No one gets him safely in the vehicle.’

Andy Redhead, a former police firearms officer, also described the lapse as ‘appalling’. ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if people on the team are transferred as a result,’ he said, adding: ‘Fortunately the man had no acid, no knife, no firearm.’

The incident comes less than a week after a gunman killed a soldier in an attack at the Canadian parliament in Ottawa. It also follows a scare in the Commons last week when a protester threw a bag of marbles at a protective screen during Prime Minister’s Questions.

The Met confirmed that the MPS Specialist Protection Command, which is responsible for protecting the Prime Minister, will review the incident in consultation with West Yorkshire Police.

The dreadlocked jogger who caused a major security scare by barging into the Prime Minister yesterday claimed he was the victim of the encounter.

Dean Farley, 28, who insisted he had no idea who he bumped into, said he had been assaulted by the PM’s close protection officers.

He said on Facebook: ‘So I’m all over the news as “the protester that attacked David Cameron in Leeds”. Yeah... if you call brushing into someone while running then getting assaulted by half a dozen coppers in suits.’

Speaking later on Radio 5 Live, he said he had been on his way to a gym. ‘I ran across the road and all I saw was a bunch of men in suits,’ he said. ‘I dodged in and out and around, next thing I know is I’ve got a half dozen suited men haranguing me and manhandling me to the floor.

‘I didn’t know it was David Cameron. There was no cordon. It begs the question how good is Cameron’s security if I managed to run between it.’
