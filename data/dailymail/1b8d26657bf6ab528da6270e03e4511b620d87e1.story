Nicky Morgan has suffered a fierce backlash from teachers who yesterday branded her 'misguided' for snubbing a major union conference.

The Association of Teachers and Lecturers said she had been 'repeatedly' invited to speak at the event but had 'chosen not to attend'.

The union also accused her of 'cynicism' over her rhetoric on teachers' workload and said it was now clear this was 'just a major PR exercise'.

Nicky Morgan has suffered a  backlash from teachers who said she was 'misguided' for snubbing a  union conference

It comes as members are due to debate possible industrial action over teachers' pay, which could take place after the general election.

The row is likely to put a damper on Mrs Morgan's efforts to placate the teachers' unions after taking over from Michael Gove last year.

She earned herself the nickname of 'Ms U-Turn' after a series of apparent departures from her predecessor's policies, but now it appears her attempt to reverse Mr Gove's war with the unions may be faltering.

At the weekend, she was attacked by NASUWT, the biggest teachers' union, for failing to accept an invitation to address their conference in Cardiff.

And according to the ATL, this year's conference in Liverpool will be the first in recent history where there will be no representative MP from the Government.

Speaking yesterday ahead of the event, general secretary Mary Bousted said: 'She was invited repeatedly. She has chosen not to attend, we don't know why she's not attending.

'I think that's not a good place for the new Secretary of State for education in a coalition government to be.

'If she really cared about teachers and if she really cared about their working lives, and the work that they're doing and the issues that they want to raise, then she would come.

'She's missing an important means to engage with teachers.'

Mary Bousted, general secretary of NASUWT, said it gave 'such a bad message' that Mrs Morgan would not go to the major union conference

Dr Bousted pointed out that Mrs Morgan had chosen to speak to head teachers at the Association of School and College Leaders at the weekend.

Lib Dem schools minister David Laws was also invited to the ATL event, but sent a 'personal apology' for not being able to make it, she said.

She said of Mrs Morgan: 'I think it's just so misguided and gives such a bad message, to be able to go and speak to school leaders but not to be able to speak to teachers.

'What is she afraid of? Would she at ATL get a bad reception? No. Would she be jeered or shouted at? No. She would get tough questioning, but she would get a perfectly polite, and perfectly courteous hearing.

'I would have thought it would be a major platform for her to speak directly to the profession, and she's chosen not to do so. I think it's a big mistake.'

She also attacked Mrs Morgan's pledge to help reduce teachers' workloads, which included a promise not to make alterations to qualifications in the academic year or during a course unless in 'exceptional circumstances'.

The measures followed a survey launched by Mrs Morgan last October called the Workload Challenge survey, which generated 44,000 returns.

At the time, she drew praise from unions after hailing teachers as 'heroes' for their efforts in the classroom.

But Dr Bousted said yesterday: 'The Government's response, in our view, shows that this was merely a cynical attempt to get 44,000 teachers' email addresses and to appear to be interested in the issue of workload.'

'In our view, the workload challenge was just a major PR exercise with no serious, significant policy response.'

On Tuesday, the ATL committee will be asked to campaign for a 'significant pay rise' for the education sector and to discuss 'joint action' with sister unions.

The resolution argues that teachers have lost the equivalent of 15 per cent in their pay packets over the past few years.

A Government spokesperson said: 'The Secretary of State recently approved a pay deal which gives heads the freedom to offer their best and most experienced teachers a 2 per cent pay rise, something that is only possible because we trust heads and governors to decide how to reward their staff.'

They said of the ATL conference: 'The Secretary of State will not be able to attend because of diary commitments.'
