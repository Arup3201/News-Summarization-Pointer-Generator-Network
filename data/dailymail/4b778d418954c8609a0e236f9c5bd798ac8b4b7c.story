A former Army Ranger has spoken for the first time about his fear that he fired the fatal round that killed NFL star Pat Tillman.

Tillman, who gave up a $3.6 million football contract to serve his country in the aftermath of 9/11, was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan when his regiment was ambushed in Afghanistan.

The footballer died after a second group of rangers, including Steven Elliott, fired towards him, believing that Tillman was a Taliban insurgent.

Haunted: Ten years after Tillman was killed by friendly fire, Steven Elliott has revealed his fears that he was responsible for the deadly shots

That fateful day, of April 22, 2004, has haunted Elliott ever since as he wondered if his bullets had been the ones to kill the 27-year-old, he told ESPN.

He was one of three Rangers who opened fire towards the ridge where Tillman was standing, in the mistaken belief that he was part of the enemy.

Despite an Army investigation into the shooting, it was never determined who fired the deadly round.

But the 33-year-old is plagued by the belief that he was responsible for the three shots that hit Tillman in the head.

'It is possible, in my mind, that I hit him,' Elliott told ESPN.

He explained that at the time of the shooting, the Rangers had been traveling through a ravine when they came under fire.

Tillman, Bryan O'Neal, and an Afghan soldier had crept on to a ridge to provide cover but, silhouetted against the setting sun, the rescue party were mistaken for the enemy.

'I remember seeing the rounds were impacting - 'pop, pop, pop, pop' - just walking in a line right up to where I was laying,' O'Neal, who was 19 at the time, said.

Elliott and another soldier had opened fire in their direction, as they mirrored the actions of their platoon leader, Sergeant Greg Baker.

'The mantra is that when all else fails 
you do what your team leader does, you go where your team leader goes 
and you shoot where your team leader shoots,' Elliott said.

'So effectively him [Baker] firing at that position is, is the 
same as his giving an order to fire â€¦ And it breaks my heart to say 
that, because I know that he regrets that - so much,' Elliott told ESPN, as his voice cracked with emotion.

Tillman, who had been a star player for the Arizona Cardinals, died from three bullet wounds to the head. The position of the fatal injury has added to Elliott's fears that he had been the one to kill him.

'You are 
holding your trigger for a fraction of a second, but that fraction of a 
second releases three to five rounds,' he said.

'If
 it looked like you had [three] rounds and very close to one another, 
well, that was very consistent to how I was firing my weapon at that 
point.'

He added: 'It would be disingenuous for me to say there is no way my 
rounds didnâ€™t kill him, because my rounds very well could have.'

Elliott left the army in 2007 and his marriage broke up as he struggled to come to terms with the events of that day.

After being treated for post traumatic stress disorder, rediscovering his faith, and patching things up with his wife - the couple recently remarried - Elliott says he finally feels able to talk about the shooting. 

'If I could change what happened, I would change it in a heartbeat,' he said.

He added that he hopes by going public with his feelings of guilt, other veterans suffering from the same concerns may find stability and support.

It may be ten years since Tillman's tragic death, but the soldier who was lauded for giving up a lucrative football career to serve his country, has left an amazing legacy.

An 8ft statue of the athlete was put up in Arizona, and schools and football stadiums have been named in his honor.

Impact: The shooting affected Elliott's life, leading him to quit the army and divorce his wife. The couple later remarried as Elliott began to cope

Perhaps the most important part of his legacy however is the 300 servicemen and woman who found their way into the forces through the Tillman Military Scholarships.

'We don't know what Pat would have done if he had lived, but I imagine he would have continued to serve for the rest of his life,' Adrian Kinsella, a Marine captain, told the Mercury News.

'That's what all of the Tillman scholars feel like we have to do. Every day I ask: "Am I living up to Pat's ideal?".'

Another scholar, Erik Wittreich, still recalls how Tillman had shrugged off his sporting fame to become a soldier.

'I remember how everyone was whispering as he was walking down a hallway, saying, "There he is",'  Wittreich, who trained with Tillman and later earned one of the scholarships, said.
