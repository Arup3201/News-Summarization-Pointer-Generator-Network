Barack Obama said today that the Boy Scouts of America should be open to gay members.

The organization is discussing ending a longstanding ban on gay members and allowing local organizations to decide their own policy.

The President said he supported the change today as he gave an interview ahead of this year's Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans.

Changes: Barack Obama told Scott Pelley on CBS that the Boy Scouts should reverse their policy which puts a ban on gay members in his traditional Super Bowl interview

Obama was speaking to Scott Pelley on CBS before the game between the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens. He has given an interview with one major network on the day of the Super Bowl every year that he has been President.

Pelley asked Obama whether the Boy Scouts should be open to gay members to which he responded: 'Yes.'

The President continued: 'I think that my attitude is that gays
and lesbians should have access and opportunity the same way everybody 
else does in every institution and walk of life.'

During the interview he also said that football was a 'great sport' but that safety fears over the game must be addressed.

The Boy Scouts have been debating on whether to lift the ban on gay members. A change in policy would mark a dramatic reversal for the 103-year-old organization, which only last summer reaffirmed the rules amid heavy criticism from gay rights groups and some parents of scouts

There have been years of protests over the rule, including petition campaigns that have prompted come corporations to suspend donations to the Boy Scouts.

Change: The Boy Scouts of America announced it is considering a dramatic retreat from its controversial policy of excluding gays as leaders and youth members

The BSA, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2010, has long excluded both gays and atheists.

Protests over the no-gays policy gained momentum in 2000, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the BSA's right to exclude gays.

Scout units lost sponsorships by public schools and other entities that adhered to nondiscrimination policies, and several local Scout councils made public their displeasure with the policy.

More recently, amid petition campaigns, shipping giant UPS Inc. and drug-manufacturer Merck announced that they were halting donations from their charitable foundations to the Boy Scouts as long as the no-gays policy was in force.

The Boy Scouts won a 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing the organization to ban gays in 2000, but has come under increasing public pressure in recent years from activists. They include Zach Wahls, an Eagle Scout with two lesbian mothers, and Jennifer Tyrrell, a lesbian mother from Ohio who was ousted as a Scout den leader and treasurer.

'This is absolutely a step in the right direction,' said Wahls, who is founder of Scouts for Equality, a group that includes 3,151 other Eagle scouts.

Wahls said he would turn to persuading local councils to enact nondiscrimination policies if the change is approved.

Tyrrell said she looked forward to a day when she and her family might participate in scouting again.

'An end to this ban will restore dignity to countless families across the country, my own included, who simply wanted to take part in all Scouting has to offer,' Tyrrell said in a statement.

GLAAD, an anti-discrimination advocacy group, began to press for a reversal of the Boy Scouts policy after Tyrrell was removed from her son's den and more than 1 million people have signed petitions on Change.org seeking an end to the policy.

More than 462,000 people signed a petition on Change.org calling for the Boy Scouts to grant an Eagle Scout application for Ryan Andresen, a California resident who is openly gay.

Andresen's scoutmaster refused to sign the application because of his sexual orientation. A review board for the California chapter recommended he receive the rank, but its recommendation was never forwarded to national headquarters.

The organization has faced pressure from board members - Ernst & Young chairman and chief executive Jim Turley and AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson have spoken out against the ban - and some corporations withdrew support over the policy

Patrick Boyle, whose 1994 book 'Scout's Honor' was among the first to examine sexual abuse in the Boy Scouts of America, said on Monday the 'striking reversal in policy' was likely the result of growing pressure from corporations.

This is a safe way out of this mess for the national organization, which takes the fight back to the local level, and says to a local leader, 'you make the choice that's right for you',' Boyle said. 'It's essentially the Boy Scouts' version of states' rights.'

However, critics of the Scouts suggest that its recruitment efforts have been hampered by high-profile controversies - notably the court-ordered release of files dealing with sex abuse allegations and persistent protests over the no-gays policy.

The BSA's overall "traditional youth membership" - Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts and Venturers - totaled 2,658,794 in 2012, compared to more than 4 million in peak years of the past. There were 910,668 Boy Scouts last year, a tiny increase from 2011, while the ranks of Venturers - a program for youths 14 and older- declined by 5.5 percent.

In addition to flak over the no-gays policy, the Scouts have been buffeted by multiple court cases related to past allegations of sexual abuse by Scout leaders, including those chronicled in long-confidential records that are widely known as the "perversion files."

Through various cases, the Scouts have been forced to reveal files dating from the 1960s to 1991. They detailed numerous cases where abuse claims were made and Boy Scout officials never alerted authorities and sometimes actively sought to protect the accused.

The Scouts are now under a California court order, affirmed this month by the state Supreme Court, to turn over sex-abuse files from 1991 through 2011 to the lawyers for a former Scout who claims a leader molested him in 2007, when he was 13. It's not clear how soon the files might become public.

The BSA has apologized for past lapses and cover-ups, and has stressed the steps taken to improve youth protection policy. Since 2010, for example, it has mandated that any suspected abuse be reported to police.
