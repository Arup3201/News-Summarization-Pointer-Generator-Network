A fire chief has caused outrage after striking a deal to quit his £200,000-a-year post, receive an estimated £700,000 payoff and then walk straight back into his former job.

London Fire Brigade Commissioner Ron Dobson has been allowed to ‘retire’ and gain access to his pension entitlements – giving him a maximum of £133,000 a year, two thirds of his salary.

But the 52-year-old has been instantly re-employed into his old position, albeit on lower pay.

His total earnings are now likely to be 
close to what they were before he retired. The deal has sparked fury 
from the Fire Brigades Union, which has branded it ‘deeply unethical’ at
 a time when many firefighters are facing job cuts and pay freezes.

Officials believe Mr Dobson has been allowed to dodge any future cuts to
 pensions and increases in tax to his lump sum by being allowed to leave
 early.

They are also angry that he was allowed to walk back into his old post 
without other candidates being considered for the position.

The Press and the public were asked to leave a meeting of the fire 
authority before the retirement and re-employment of Mr Dobson were 
discussed under an item listed as ‘continuity arrangements’.

Paul Embery, regional official of the union, said:

‘It appears deeply 
unethical for a deal like this to be hammered out in secret at a time 
when ordinary firefighters are suffering tough austerity measures.

‘When firefighters are subject to a pay freeze and 25 per cent cuts in spending, this is obscene.

‘It shows there’s one rule for fat cats and another for the rest of us.

‘This kind of decision should be made in public so that it can be 
properly scrutinised instead of being made in a cloak and dagger way.’

Emma Boon, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This practice of 
double-dipping – claiming pay and a pension – has happened in other 
parts of the public sector and is costing taxpayers dearly. It must 
stop.’

The firefighters’ pension scheme allows for a two-thirds salary pension,
 which would give Mr Dobson £133,333 annually, based on his final salary
 of around £200,000 a year.

Workers may convert up to quarter of their pension into a lump sum 
called a ‘commutation’ – which would allow Mr Dobson to draw £716,000. If he takes this, his annual pension would be reduced to about £100,000.

Last night a London Fire Brigade spokesman declined to discuss the 
figures, but insisted the move represented a ‘cost saving’ because of Mr
 Dobson’s lower salary.

It ensured a highly regarded commissioner was in office during the run-up to the 2012 Olympics and beyond, he added.

Mr Dobson is married with three children and oversees 7,000 staff in the
 world’s third-largest fire and rescue service. He joined in 1979 and 
became commissioner in 2007.

In May, Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service’s chief fire officer, Peter 
Holland, retired on a £425,000 payout and was re-hired on a £75,000 
salary.

Strathclyde Fire and Rescue chief Brian Sweeney retired with an 
estimated £500,000 pension lump sum and walked back into his old job 
with a salary of £150,000.

Under a three-year contract, he was unable to touch his £75,000 annual pension.

At the time, he said: ‘People need to understand it’s not taxpayers’ money – it’s my private pension.’
