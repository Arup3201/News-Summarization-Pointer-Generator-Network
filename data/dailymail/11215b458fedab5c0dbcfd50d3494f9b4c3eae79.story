The BBC has been condemned for paying its staff up to £150,000 each to move to its new base in Salford without keeping a full record of who authorised the sums.

In a report published today, the public accounts committee of MPs said many of the allowances, which totaled £24million, were ‘excessive’ and ‘difficult to justify’ to licence fee payers.

In total, the corporation has spent £942million setting up a new northern base to help redress a perceived ‘imbalance’ in its coverage, but has had to offer 900 staff an average of £28,000 each to persuade them to move.

'Difficult to justify': The BBC has been condemned for paying its staff up to £150,000 each to move to its new base in Salford Quays (pictured), Greater Manchester, without recording who authorised the sums

Last night, the PAC’s chairman Margaret Hodge praised the BBC for moving to Salford on time, but condemned its financial management saying: ‘The scale of some of the allowances paid to staff to relocate to Salford is difficult to justify. 

‘There were 11 cases where the cost of relocating staff exceeded £100,000 per person, with one costing £150,000.

'And it is not acceptable that the BBC also failed to make a proper record of the exceptions it made to its allowance policy.’

The PAC report said the BBC Trust acknowledged that ‘some of the individual relocation packages involved ‘huge’ amounts of money that would aggravate licence fee payers’.

It found around ten per cent of staff were granted more than they were entitled to under the BBC’s standard allowance, but failed to keep a full record of why these exceptions were granted.

Miss Hodge said the failure to keep proper records was ‘not acceptable’.

The report follows a damning study by the National Audit Office published in May, which found the BBC’s financial oversight was ‘inadequate’. 

Relocation perks offered to BBC staff included a guaranteed minimum price on their old home if they sold it and moved north.

They could also claim a two-year ‘remote location allowance’ worth £1,900 a month to cover the cost of travel and renting a property in Salford if they were unwilling to commit to move north.

Among those taking advantage of the generous offer is BBC Breakfast presenter Susannah Reid, who makes the 200-mile commute three times a week at licence fee payers’ expense.

Other staff were offered a one off payment of £5,000 to help them move, while homeowners could claim £3,000 towards household goods.

Despite the huge expense of moving to Salford, the BBC does not own its new office space or studios. Instead, it rents them from real estate giant the Peel Group.

The PAC raised concerns about the 10-year arrangement, saying the BBC could risk locking itself into making payments for buildings it may not use.

It also warned the corporation risked damaging its reputation by associating itself with the company, which was accused of avoiding corporation tax earlier this year. The Peel Group has always denied the allegations.

The PAC said: ‘The BBC needs to 
demonstrate to the BBC Trust that it has assessed the potential risks of
 the Peel Group having a dominant position at its Salford site and taken
 appropriate steps to address them.

‘It should also make clear its expectation that, as an organisation funded by the licence fee, it expects companies with which it contracts to pay their fair share of tax.’

It added: added: ‘The BBC’s relationships with the Peel Group and other partner organisations involve potential reputational risks, for example, regarding the extent to which partner organisations are transparent about their tax status in the UK and the amount of tax they pay.’

Miss Hodge said her committee would report later in the year on another case of BBC financial mismanagement, the Digital Media Initiative. The disastrous project was scrapped earlier this year at a cost of £100million.

She said: ‘We are dismayed at the abandonment of the BBC’s Digital Media Initiative at a cost to the licence fee payer of £100 million.

'There have been conflicting reports from the BBC and the BBC Trust on what the project did or did not deliver. We will return to this matter later in the year, once the facts have been established.’
