One of Sydney's busiest tunnel roads was thrown into chaos today when a car exploded into a ball of flames.

The silver Toyota four-wheel-drive burst into fire about 6:30pm on Sunday in the Domain tunnel, causing major traffic delays and widespread fear. 

The flames engulfed the car but luckily the three people travelling in the Rav 4 managed to escape without any injury.

It is still unknown what caused the incident but emergency services are investigating the situation. 

In a video posted on the Kyle and Jackie O show, a passer-by managed to capture the unbelievable scene. 

The car appears to be facing the right way in the tunnel but the whole bonnet is covered in flames. 

According to Live Traffic Sydney's Twitter page, the tunnel will be closed for the remainder of the night as emergency repair work is conducted. 

Live Traffic Sydney updated Twitter users and have said that the tunnel will be closed from 10pm tonight for emergency repair work

Traffic delays have subsided since the incident but motorists have been advised to avoid the area as the sprinklers in the tunnel were still running. 

All lanes were closed in both directions for one hour with traffic being diverted at Macquarie Street.

However the tunnel reopened about 8pm and traffic began to enter the tunnel as normal. 

The car was towed and motorists were advised to avoid the area and use the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
