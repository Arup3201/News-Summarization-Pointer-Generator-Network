NYPD officers arrested 32 people in a massive narcotics bust in Staten Island, including a 22-year-old woman who paraded around in a blue fairy costume in a YouTube music video.

Sharissa Turk, who appeared in an amateur music video last summer, was arrested on the borough’s South Shore after allegedly selling Oxycodone to an undercover police officer on three separate occasions.

Turk is one of 32 people caught in a loosely affiliated drug bust in several of the surrounding precincts.

Follow the blue fairy: Sharissa Turk, 22, who is pictured in an amateur rap video about drug use in Staten Island, was arrested in a drug bust along with 31 others in the borough

Everything is blue: A group called White Trash Clan posted this video called 'Everything Is Blue' to YouTube, glorifying use of narcotics

In the video, which is posted by a user named ‘AnonymousEnter,’ a group called White Trash Clan raps about the harsh life of drug dealing in the borough.

Some of the lyrics of ‘My World Is Blue’ include: ‘I can stop when I want to/ I’m not addicted/ I don’t take pills/ crush and sniff it/Blue is my world in the life how I live it/ Come out to Staten Island/ pay a little visit.’

The chorus is sampled from ‘Love Is Blue,’ a song written in 1967 by Andre Popp that was made famous by French orchestra leader Paul Mauriat.

Oxycodone comes in several colors, based on dosage. Blue pills are the highest, at 30 mg of Oxycodone per pill.

As they rap, Turk dances around with blue fairy wings and an ethereal skirt, blowing ‘fairy dust’ at the camera and waving her wand to and fro.

The rappers also call the island off the southern tip of Manhattan a ‘painkiller paradise.’

Below the video, which is full of drug references and allusions, the uploader writes: ‘White Trash does not encourage the use of drugs.’

She was arrested at Edible Arrangements in Tompkinsville, according to the New York Post, and was arraigned at the criminal court in Staten Island.

Recovered: Hundreds of pills, including oxycodone, Vicodin, and Xanax were seized, as well as $17,000 in cash and four guns

Recovered: This was one of four guns recovered in the massive drug bust

The Staten Island Advance reports that NYPD officers made a broad sweep of the island, seizing hundreds of narcotics, including oxycodone, Vicodin, Xanax, cocaine, and marijuana.

In addition, three handguns and a shotgun were recovered, as well as $17,000 in cash.

Brian Piscopo, 29, is the only other alleged drug dealer that has been named in the bust.

He was allegedly found to have had a loaded 380-caliber Keltic semi-automatic pistol under his bed at his home in Eltingville.

According to police, the names of the other 30 offenders will be released soon. Officers said that the alleged perpetrators’ ages range from 18 to 54.
