Everton fans that attended the Premier League match against West Brom on Monday night are set to feature in the new Rocky film 'Creed' alongside Hollywood star Sylvester Stallone.

Boxer Tony Bellew, who is a life-long Toffees supporter, has landed a major part in the movie and arranged for a camera crew to capture the scenes inside Goodison Park.

A message for supporters to stay in their seats at half time appeared on the big screens during the match next to a picture of Stallone holding aloft an Everton scarf.

On Monday afternoon, ahead of their clash against the Baggies, Everton confirmed there will be a film crew present at half-time by tweeting: 'Remember to stay in your seats at HT to star alongside @TheSlyStallone and @TonyBellew in the new 'Rocky' film. #EFC.'

Bellew plays Pretty Boy Porter, the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet and the man standing in the way of Adonis Creed - the son of late former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.

Sylvester Stallone, who claims to be an Everton fan after attending the club's 1-1 draw with Reading in January 2007 following an invite from Blues shareholder and Planet Hollywood owner Robert Earl, reprises his role as legendary boxer Rocky Balboa to train Creed Junior for the most important bout of his life.

Bellew was unable to attend the Premier League clash against the Baggies but he was keen to involve his fellow Evertonians in his latest project after witnessing the raucous reception given to a scarf-waving Stallone eight years ago.

In a message to those who were inside the ground on Monday night, Bellew said: 'I would like you to stay in your seats at half-time and keep any eye on the big screens for a very special guest to make a welcome return to Goodison Park.

'Be sure you make as much noise as possible - go absolutely nuts at half-time - to help us create a brilliant atmosphere. I have seen firsthand what kind of noise Evertonians create – it will be perfect for the scene.'

Appearing in a Hollywood blockbuster may serve as some consolation for supporters after they watched their side endure a frustrating 0-0 draw against West Brom.

Kevin Mirallas missed a penalty for the home side just before half time as Everton made it one win in the last 13 in all competitions as Roberto Martinez's side were booed off at full time.
