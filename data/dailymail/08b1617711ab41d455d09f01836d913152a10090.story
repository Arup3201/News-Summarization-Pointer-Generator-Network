No-one in the long history of major championship golf dating back to 1860 had ever followed up an opening 65 with another round equally as good.

Not in 78 Masters tournaments, 95 USPGA Championships, 142 Opens or the first 113 editions of the United States Open.

Red hot: Martin Kaymer carded a second successive 65 in the second round at Pinehurst

Something special happened at the 114th at Pinehurst yesterday, therefore, as Martin Kaymer continued his remorseless brilliance to record a second successive score of five under par.

His total of 130 strokes beat the old 36 hole record set by Rory McIlroy in 2011 by one and opened up a six shot advantage at halfway.

The only other players who have spread-eagled a US Open field to lead by six at this stage are McIlroy three years ago and Tiger Woods in 2000. They went on to win by eight and 15 shots respectively.

Sensational: Germany's Martin Kaymer holds a six-shot lead after just 36 holes at the US Open

Kaymer’s nearest pursuer is American Brendon Todd, who must be struggling to understand how he’s so far in arrears after shooting 69-67. Henrik Stenson will start eight behind while Rory McIlroy is nine in arrears after a fine 68. Ian Poulter is on level par while defending champion Justin Rose shot 69 and is on one over but Graeme McDowell faded with a 74.

England’s US Amateur Champion Matt Fitzpatrick shot 73 for a four over total only one shot worse than his playing partner, Phil Mickelson. The teenager made the halfway cut and is in prime position to conclude his glittering career in the non-paid ranks by winning the silver medal as low amateur.

It was quite a day for young sportsmen from Sheffield, then, and Fitzpatrick revealed afterwards that he and double centurion Joe Root had exchanged congratulatory texts.

Focused: Kaymer hits from a bunker on the 14th hole during the second round

What an outstanding opportunity Kaymer has carved out for himself to follow up his Players Championship win in Florida last month with his second major championship success.

To think, if he pulls it off, he will have won as many majors before the age of 30 as Bernhard Langer, comfortably the finest German golfer of all time, managed in his entire career. He also holed a putt to win a Ryder Cup at Medinah, lest we forget, whereas Langer, alas, missed one.

What feels like a coronation waiting to happen  can look something different altogether, of course, when a player has had more than 24 hours to sleep on his performance. It’s fairly safe to assume the greens will harden up for the final two rounds and chipping from tight lies is not Kaymer’s strongest suit.

Chasing: Rory McIlroy remains in contention but will need something special to catch Kaymer

But the 29 year old from Dusseldorf has a formidable record as a frontrunner and it will be a surprise if he doesn’t add this trophy to the USPGA title he won in 2010.

He looked like he might dominate the game thereafter but found being world number one and the demands on his time at odds with his aversion of the spotlight. While he adjusted, he fell outside the world’s top 50.

Happily, those days of struggle are now behind him, but he retains a nice sense of perspective. Asked by an American how this performance would play in the media back home with the World Cup now underway, he replied: ‘I’m thankful Germany don’t play until Monday, so I might get a mention or two. And if I win, it would play well until the time of the game against Portugal and then it would be forgotten.’

Impressive: English amateur Matthew Fitzpatrick made the cut at Pinehurst

In reality, Kaymer is due home in ten days’ time to play in the BMW International being staged in Cologne, just a 40 minute drive from where he was brought up. You can be sure one or two people would turn up if he was US Open Champion.

What a performance he has put on here to date. He needed just 63 shots to play the back nine over the first two days and deserved the odd moment of fortune that came his way. At the 18th, following a rare stray drive into the ‘native area,’ he smiled to himself as he found his ball sitting like a cherry on top of a cake.

A couple of errant iron approaches also allowed him to show off his bunker prowess, while he never looked like missing a holeable putt.

Alongside a member of the elite at the top of his trade we had romance too, in the shape of 49 year old American Fran Quinn.

He might be the ultimate example of a journeyman pro. He’s spent his career largely on the Web.com tour, the satellite circuit one rung below the PGA Tour. In his forays on the main circuit dating back to 1988, he’s made a total of $195,000. To put that figure in perspective, there are 173 players on the PGA Tour who have made more than that this season alone.

One of the great joys of the two Opens on either side of the Atlantic is that players can come through qualifying and take their place on the biggest stages. With his 15 year old son Owen on the bag, the not so mighty Quinn belied his lowly status with a marvellous first round 68 to be tied second after the opening day.

Could he keep it going? He wobbled in the middle of his second round but a 74 meant he comfortably made the halfway cut. He will get to enjoy quite a Father’s Day alongside his son tomorrow.
