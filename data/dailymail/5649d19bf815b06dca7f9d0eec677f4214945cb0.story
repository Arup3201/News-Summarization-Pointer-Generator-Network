Jack Daniel's is to spend more than $100 million expanding its rural Tennessee distillery so it can keep up with demand in the growing whiskey market.

The investment is the largest single production expansion in 
the brand's long history. It will add stills and barrel warehouses at 
the Jack Daniel's operations in Lynchburg, the brand's 
parent company, Brown-Forman Corp, announced.

A second production building will go up on the same grounds as the 
current distillery site, which traces its roots back to just after the
 Civil War ended.

Company officials said the distillery was bumping up against capacity pressures that will be relieved by the 
second production facility, but they did not say how many new warehouses will be built for the whiskey to age in.

'It's a good time in the whiskey industry, and our future prospects 
look really good,' Jeff Arnett, the brand's master distiller, said.

'We don't want to find ourselves without any additional throttle, if we
 need it. This will basically secure that we've got the ability to give 
Jack Daniel's to all of those who want Jack Daniel's for years to come.'

The new production facility, which will take two years to complete, will have access to the same source of cave spring water as the existing distillery, he said.

'It's going to ensure that every drop of Jack Daniel's is made here 
in Lynchburg, Tennessee, from the same water source,' Mr Arnett said.

Sales have soared for the brand in the past decade, as Jack Daniel's has spread to more countries. The brand has had volume growth for 
21 straight years, and its global net sales increased by 9 per cent in 
the past year.

Since 2004, global case sales have risen from about 7.7 
million cases to nearly 11 million cases last year.

The brand is sold in more than 160 countries, but the U.S. still ranks as
 its largest market, with domestic sales also growing in 2012.

Overseas markets represent slightly more than half of overall
 sales. Its largest international markets include the UK, 
Germany and Australia, where the brand's premixed cocktails are popular.

Emerging markets such as Russia, China, Turkey and Brazil have become 
key contributors to global sales.

Cheers: Master distiller Jeff Arnett says the plans mean they will be able to keep up with demand

In neighboring Kentucky, the bourbon industry is in the midst of its largest expansion since Prohibition to meet growing demand.

In the past two years, Kentucky's bourbon makers have invested nearly
 $300 million in new and expanded production facilities, warehouses and
visitors' centers.

Kentucky produces 95 per cent
 of the world's bourbon, and the 4.9 million barrels of aging bourbon in
 Kentucky outnumber the state's 4.3 million people.

Jack Daniel's is the flagship brand for Brown-Forman, whose other 
brands include Southern Comfort, Finlandia, Korbel and el Jimador.

The expansion will give Jack Daniel's 
more room to roll out new products, part of a key industry-wide trend as 
spirits makers introduce new flavors.

The 147-year-old distillery and its employees, along with Lynchburg, 
have been the focus of Jack Daniel's folksy advertising for years.

Black-and-white labeled bottles of the charcoal mellowed 'sippin' whiskey'
 list Lynchburg's population as 361, but the town and county really has about 6,400 residents.

The distillery is tucked away on 1,700 hilly acres down the road from
 the town square in Lynchburg, about 65 miles south of Nashville.

Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam called Jack Daniel's a 'global ambassador' for the state.

'Jack Daniel's is one of our most historic exports, and it helps us 
in our efforts to bring new Tennessee products to the world 
marketplace,' he said.

The expansion will add about 90 full-time jobs in the next five 
years, the company said. The distillery currently employs about 435 
workers.
