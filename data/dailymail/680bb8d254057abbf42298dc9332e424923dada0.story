A trainee lawyer who accused a City law firm of sex discrimination was subjected to a 'full frontal attack' on her abilities by a corporate partner, a tribunal heard today.

The same corporate partner was also said to have criticised Katie Tantum, 33, for leaving early when she went home at 6.30am after working all night in the office on a major project.

Miss Tantum was a trainee on £42,000 a year at Travers Smith when she told them she was expecting a baby.

But she claims the firm 'just stopped bothering' with her when they discovered she was pregnant.

Katie Tantum is suing law firm Travers Smith for loss of earnings after claiming she was not offered another contract when she told bosses she was pregnant

Miss Tantum claims the company failed to offer her a permanent contract because they did not want to pay maternity leave, despite a glowing review from the firm's head of real estate. Now she is suing for loss of earnings.

Helen Croke, a partner in the corporate department, told other bosses during a review of Miss Tantum’s progress that the Cambridge graduate 'lacked drive and enthusiasm' and made mistakes on important documents.

She said: 'I saw certain things in Katie that made me talk to Caroline Murphy (her first supervisor). I was very involved in why Katie was not given a job in corporate.

'It was a not a good review. Clearly corporate wasn’t a good seat for her.'

When comparing Miss Tantum's review with that of another trainee, Ms Croke said it was like 'comparing apples and oranges.'

She said Miss Tantum made mistakes on an important corporate transaction when the team had to work through the night.

She added: 'Katie would have been working on very particular types of documents, processing documents and transferring shares.

'Those were the documents I particularly noticed, and other transactions, were coming back and being marked as incorrect.

'I was aware of mistakes. The impression I received from both Caroline and another employee was that Katie’s work on transactions were poor.

'When you’re in a situation where work is frustrating assistants because it was incorrect, that is not the time I can take on a review of a trainee.

'I can’t believe she didn’t know she was making mistakes.'

Miss Tantum's lawyer accused Ms Croke of launching a 'full frontal attack' on Miss Tantum in her witness statement after she said the plaintiff 'gave the impression she didn’t want to do what she was doing'.

The tribunal also heard that Ms Croke was 'very critical' of Miss Tantum after she worked through the night on the transaction, but left at around 6.30am because she did not feel well.

David Massarella, representing Miss Tantum, said: 'You made a comment on her leaving work in the middle of the night.

'She knows she left at 6.30am. She knows that because she went to Pret, which does not open until then.'

Ms Croke denies criticising Miss Tantum's behaviour that night.

In March last year, Miss Tantum, from Kew, west London, said she discovered she was pregnant and told her bosses.

In her witness statement she said: 'I told my supervisor, Mahesh Varia, who seemed supportive and thanked me for telling him.

Miss Tantum said she was criticised for leaving early when she went home at 6.30am after working all night

'But Mr Mahesh just stopped bothering with me. I was not given anywhere near the same amount of work, which I found frustrating.'

Miss Tantum, who is fluent in French and German, said once she became visibly pregnant she felt the need to tell people she was not planning to take her full maternity leave and was ‘absolutely committed to returning to the firm’.

However, in May she learned that she was not to be offered a permanent contract with the firm.

She said senior partner Andrew King told her that ‘no one put their hand up’ for her.

She said: 'I was one of only three trainees out of 22 not retained permanently or given a minimum one-year contract.'

The firm's head of real estate told the hearing he was 'delighted' to find out Miss Tantum was pregnant.

Julian Bass said: 'Having shared a room with Katie for six months, we got on very well. When she told me she was pregnant I wasn’t surprised because of her age and so on.

'I was genuinely delighted.'

But despite a glowing review from Mr Bass, Miss Tantum was not offered a place in the real estate department, even though there were two spaces for trainees.

He said: 'She was a strong contender in the real estate department. She demonstrated the sort of skills which could make her a good real estate lawyer.'

The tribunal also heard how the pregnancy was not even mentioned by 'mute' partners when discussing Miss Tantum’s future at the firm.

Ms Croke said: 'I don’t believe there is pregnancy discrimination at Travers Smith.'

The hearing continues.
