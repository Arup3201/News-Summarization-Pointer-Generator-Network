The Whopper has some new competition in a vintage favorite. 

Four decades after it was discontinued, Burger King is bringing back their Yumbo sandwich with a marketing campaign full of 1970s nostalgia.

The hot ham and cheese sandwich is back on the menu for a limited time starting Tuesday, and to mark the occasion, the chain has filled their Facebook with throwback posts to the disco era.

Burger King first introduced the Yumbo to the menu in 1968, but it had a relatively short run and was eventually retired in 1974.

Welcome back, Yumbo: Burger King is now offering the 'Yumbo' on their menu again, four decades after the hot ham and cheese sandwich was retired

However, Burger King regulars haven't forgot the cult classic. 

'Our franchisees came to us after years of hearing requests' for the sandwich, Burger King's Chief Marketing Officer Eric Hirschorn told BurgerBusiness.com.  'There is a lot of nostalgia around the brand and these classic sandwiches, and we’re also excited to introduce it to new generations.'

'It got to the point where it’s one of those things we can no longer ignore,' he added to Bloomberg. 

The Yumbo is made with black forest ham and melted American cheese, with the addition of lettuce, mayo and a hoagie bun for it's latest reincarnation. It costs $3.69 and is also a new option on the 2 for $5 menu. 

Hirschorn says the Yumbo will only be back for a limited time, but wouldn't specify for how long it will be on offer at the chain's more than 7,000 North American restaurants.

The Yumbo's return follows Burger King's successful reintroduction of chicken fries earlier this year. But Hirschorn insists the company is not focused on redesigning their menu around nostalgic items.

Last month, the chain posted stronger than expected sales with a third-quarter gain of 3.6 per cent in the U.S. and Canada.

Burger King is also currently looking to expand it's business by buying Canadian donut chain Tim Hortons.   

The customer's always right: Burger King's Chief Marketing Officer Eric Hirschorn says they decided to bring back the sandwich after receiving requests from loyal customers for years
