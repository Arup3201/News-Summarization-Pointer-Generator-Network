A Tennessee waitress found herself wiping away tears on Sunday after a kindly couple left her a big tip on their little check.

But it wasn't just the $36 that had 25-year-old Claire Hudson crying. Along with the tip, the couple left a note explaining their generosity.

'I would've liked to have caught them and said 'Hey this is awesome!,'' Hudson told ABC News. 'They did it anonymously and it was really sweet.' 

Touched: Spring Hill, Tennessee waitress Claire Hudson broke down in tears after a patron on Sunday left her a $36 tip in honor of his late brother's 36th birthday and favorite meal

In the note on the credit card receipt, the patron wrote:

'Today is my brother's b-day. He would have been 36 today. Every year I go eat his favorite meal (hot dogs) and tip the waitress his age. Happy B-day Wes.'

Hudson said the check in total wasn't much more than $30 when the couple settled up at Mac's Grub Shak in Spring Hill.

'It was actually a really slow day,' Hudson told ABC. I was in tears when I read [the note]...I had to go in the back of the restaurant and compose myself before I went out to my other tables.'

'What none of my employees know is that I too lost my brother.

'In just a few weeks he would have been 28. 

'It's odd that this man would choose my restaurant over any other place.'

'This was so absolutely heartwarming and made me smile that someone would do this. 

'It rekindles my hope for people as a whole.'
