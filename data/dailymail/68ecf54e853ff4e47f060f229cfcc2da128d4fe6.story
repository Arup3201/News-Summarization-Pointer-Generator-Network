Sued: A Queens woman sued Dr Grigoriy Mashkevich for posting before and after pictures of her nose job online without her permission

A New York woman was upset to find before and after pictures of her nose job online.

Catherine Manzione, 24, is suing for $23 million after pictures of her rhinoplasty were put on her doctor's website without her permission, according to a lawsuit filed June 16 in Manhattan Supreme Court.

The Flushing, Queens, woman said she did not give permission to use pre- and post-op photos on Dr Grigoriy Mashkevich's website when she had surgery at his Manhattan office in 2010.

But three years later this February, Manzione found the pictures online.

She said she had the surgery to 'to improve her appearance, self-esteem and confidence,' but some of her confidence was shattered when she saw the before and after shots were public.

The lawsuit alleges Manzione  is 'greatly distressed and humiliated' because of the pictures' publication. She said her reputation is also injured and she has been exposed 'to public ridicule and contempt'. 

Mashkevich's office was closed Sunday and calls from both MailOnline and the Post were not returned.

The lawsuit named Mashkevich and his practice, as well as the NSE Media, which hosts the doctor's website.

The doctor and the company posted the pictures 'in order to entice the public at large to purchase their services', according to the lawsuit.

Privacy: Catherine Manzione said she was humiliated after Dr Mashkevich posted the pictures on his website, pictured, which she says the practice did 'in order to entice the public at large to purchase their services'

Manzione is seeking $23 million, including $5 million in punitive damages, for privacy violation and breach of contract, among other actions.

The shots of Manzione, a married mother, appeared to be gone from Mashkevich's website Sunday morning. But more than a dozen before and after pictures of his patients are still visible in the site's photo gallery.

Some of the pictures showing reconstruction after skin cancer are graphic.

Patients quoted in testimonials on the site called Mashkevich an 'honest', 'amazing' and 'talented' doctor.

'Long story short I have a nice nose that fits my face. I had high expectations and Dr.Mashkevich and staff has surpassed my expectations!' wrote one rhinoplasty patient, Diana D.

'So much has changed for the better since I had my rhinoplasty, and I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate what you did for me,' wrote another patient, Gregory P.
