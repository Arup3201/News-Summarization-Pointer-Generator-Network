More than 150,000 people have signed petitions to block a Texas hunter from importing and killing an endangered black rhinoceros. 

Corey Knowlton bid $350,000 at an auction last January for the 'privilege', which the Dallas Safari Club billed as a fundraising effort to save the species.

Since publishing the application request to import the carcass, U.S. Fish And Wildlife Service officials have received 15,000 comments against, and 135,000 signatures on a petition to the same effect. 

It is an unprecedented response to a U.S. Fish And Wildlife Service application, which normally receives around eight comments per case. 

Controversy: Corey Knowlton bid $350,000 at a January auction for a rare permit to hunt endangered black rhinoceros in Namibia. His request has received an unprecedented number of responses blocking it

'I'm not sure we've ever received a petition quite like this one before,' said service spokesman Gavin Shire.

Shire said the agency will examine the public comments 'for substantive information' as it weighs whether the hunt in Namibia — where 1,800 of the remaining 4,880 black rhinos live — is a form of conservation.

The club said the hunt is postponed until Knowlton gets permission to import the trophy of one of five black rhinos approved by the Namibian government for culling.

Namibia sold another hunting permit directly to Michael Luzich, a Las Vegas investment manager who also is seeking a permit to bring the trophy into the U.S.

But Luzich has received far less scrutiny than Knowlton, who said in January he hired full-time security because he received death threats after his name was leaked on the Internet.

The agency granted a permit to import a sport-hunted black rhino taken in Namibia in 2009, but has said it is applying extra scrutiny to Knowlton's request because of the rise in poaching.

Environmentalists say the animals are already under the gun for their prized horns, and that allowing them to be hunted is wrong.

'Kill it to save it is counterintuitive and flawed logic,' said Jeff Flocken, the North American regional director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare. 

'The fact that some Americans are showing they will pay any price to kill one of the last black rhinos is not going to help the species in the long run but only continue to put a price on its head.'
