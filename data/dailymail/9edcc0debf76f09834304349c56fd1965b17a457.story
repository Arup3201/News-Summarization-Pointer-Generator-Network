A man sleeping in a school hallway with a glass smoking pipe and a bag of synthetic marijuana marked 'Scooby Snax', was found by police just outside Philadelphia. 

Police discovered John-Paul Sabara inside the Tawanka Learning Center in Lower Southampton around 3:20 a.m. Monday after spotting a bicycle parked outside the building, The Bucks County Courier Times reported. 

The 35-year-old Middletown man growled, made strange sounds and acted aggressively toward officers trying to wake him, police said.
