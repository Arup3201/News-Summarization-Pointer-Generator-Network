An Australian cyclist has taken a tumble just before the finish line during the European women's cycling tour, after a spectator's hand reached out and hit her handlebars.

Loren Rowney was just metres away from finishing the Molecaten Drentse 8 in The Netherlands, when a hand emerged from the side barrier crowded by spectators.

It appears to have grabbed onto Rowney's handles, which sent her flying over her bike.

The 26-year-old managed to crawl over to the finish line but is believed to have suffered a broken collarbone, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

South-African born Rowney laid on her back until medical officers helped her off the track.

While the Australian came seventh place, race winner and two-time world champion Giorgia Bronzini of Italy described the finish as 'strange'.

'I thought at first that maybe it was my fault,' she said, the Herald reports.

'But I've already seen the footage and it looks like a spectator grips her wheel. Very strange.'

Rowney took to Twitter to thank everybody for the well wishes. 

'I'll try and get back to you all... it's hard with 1 arm! on my way to Hamburg for treatment,' Rowney wrote on Friday.
