A man accused of shooting dead three people and ordering the killing of a fourth is fighting the death penalty - as he asks for permission to marry in jail instead.

Kenneth 'Cody' Rackemann, 24, has asked an Indiana judge to reconsider his bid to marry his fianc√©e, Tia Brasfield, after the request was denied in April.

The request cites a federal court ruling
 that says 'it is unconstitutional for a jail to prohibit the defendant 
from getting married for any reason not related to a legitimate 
penological interest', the IndyStar reported.

Request: Cody Rackemann, left, has asked for permission to marry Tia Brasfield, right. Before his arrest, he had 'T 100' tattooed on his forehead - a reference to a name he and his associates used for their group

It comes as Rackemann's attorneys claim that prosecutors' request for the death penalty, which was filed in Marion Superior Court in July, violate the man's constitutional rights.

Rackemann, who formerly worked in security for a drug dealer, is being held in Marion County Jail, Indiana, accused in the killing of the dealer and three associates at a house in Indianapolis.

He is one of four people charged with the deaths of Walter 'Buddy' Burnell, 47, Jacob Rodemich, 43, Kristy Sanchez, 22, and Hayley Navarro, 21, during the house robbery in February.

One of the defendants, Samantha Bradley, pleaded guilty earlier this month to a conspiracy charge and agreed to testify against the other defendants in exchange for dropping the other charges.

Prosecutors say Rackemann shot  Burnell - the drug dealer - Rodemich and Sanchez and directed another defendant, Valencia Williams, 21, to kill Navarro.

Just hours before he was arrested two days after the bodies were found, Rackemann went to a tattoo parlor and he and a fellow defendant, Anthony LaRussa, 26, received matching tattoos.

They were both inked with 'Sweet Dreams' on their eyelids and both received 'T 100' on their foreheads, referring to Team 100, a name they gave themselves, Fox59 reported.

The tattoos are visible in Rackemann's mug shots.

Rackemann's
 fiancee, Tia Brasfield, expresses her support for her husband-to-be on 
her Facebook page, and has uploaded a photo collage of her and her 
boyfriend with the caption: 'Free my baby.'

Killed: Walter Burnell, a drug dealer who lived at the home, and Jacob Rodemich were shot dead in the robbery, Rackemann, who had previously worked in security for Burnell, is accused of shooting dead both men

Victims: He also allegedly shot Kristy Sanchez, left, and ordered another suspect to kill Hayley Navarra, right

Scene: The four bodies were found inside Burnell's Indianapolis home, pictured, in February

The mother-of-two has also previously defended him to the press.

'Cody doesn't have the heart to kill anybody like that,' she told ABC6. 'That's not him. He's not capable of that.'

Rackemann faces four counts of murder, four counts of felony murder, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery, while LaRussa faces four counts of felony murder, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery.

Another defendant, Valencia Williams, who allegedly shot the fourth victim, faces one count of murder, four counts of felony murder, robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery.
