When Andrew Knight broke his hip in a bicycle accident, he didn’t expect to be treated like a piece of furniture – but that’s exactly what happened.

With no ambulances available, paramedics were forced to bundle him into the back of a commandeered furniture lorry.

A response car had arrived on the scene soon after the accident, but an approaching ambulance was rerouted to a more serious incident.

Injured: Paramedics commandeered a furniture removal lorry to take Andrew Knight to hospital after he broke his hip in a bicycle accident

The medics asked for an air ambulance to be sent immediately, but it could only land in a field nearly a quarter of a mile away.

Medical staff and police officers at the scene decided the quickest way to get Mr Knight, 36, to the helicopter was to rope in a nearby furniture lorry, leaving its driver – and a table being delivered to Apprentice star Lord Sugar – at the roadside in Loughton, Essex.

Mr Knight, who also damaged his pelvis and abdomen after slipping on an oil spill at a dangerous junction, was loaded into the lorry using a lift normally reserved for crates.

The librarian, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex, was then driven to the waiting helicopter before being flown to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow.

He said: ‘I want to say thanks to the driver of the van and sorry to Lord Sugar if I made his table late.’But he also used the incident to warn against cuts to ambulance services, adding: ‘If George Osborne’s health service cuts go ahead we could all be getting furniture vans to hospital.’

The van’s driver, Kirk Jeakins, 40, said air ambulance staff had blamed cutbacks for the lack of ambulances. ‘They weren’t happy,’ he added.

A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service denied cuts were to blame, and said that using passing vehicles for the transfer of patients was not unusual.

‘Ambulance crews have to think quickly on their feet,’ he said.
