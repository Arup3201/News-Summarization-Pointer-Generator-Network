'Without pain': Author Iain Banks passed away yesterday morning

Best-selling author Iain Banks lost his battle with cancer yesterday – weeks after marrying his partner and just days before the publication of his final novel.

The 59-year-old, who wrote The Wasp Factory, stunned his many fans in April when he revealed he was suffering from gall bladder cancer and that he  was ‘unlikely’ to survive longer than  a year.

With typical dark humour he said he was ‘officially very poorly’ and revealed he had  asked his long-term partner Adele  Hartley, 42, an author and horror film curator, if she would ‘do me the honour of becoming my widow’.

They married in a humanist ceremony in the Scottish Highlands over the Easter weekend before a short honeymoon in Venice and Paris.

From then she jokingly referred to herself as ‘chief widow-in-waiting’.

Yesterday she issued a statement through Banks’s website, saying: ‘Iain died in the early hours this morning. His death was calm and without pain.’

Banks passed away just three weeks after being presented with finished copies of his final book The Quarry, which is about a man who is dying of cancer, ahead of its release on June 20.

In a statement his publisher Little, Brown said he was ‘an irreplaceable part of the literary world’ and ‘one of the country’s best-loved novelists’.

Banks, who also wrote science fiction novels as Iain M Banks, revealed his terminal illness on his blog in April, a month after his diagnosis.

He wrote: ‘The bottom line, now, I’m afraid, is that as a late stage gall bladder cancer patient, I’m expected to live for “several months” and it’s extremely unlikely I’ll live beyond a year.’ 

Praising the ‘professionalism’ of the NHS, he said a course of chemotherapy might extend his life for ‘several months’ but that he would withdraw from all planned public engagements.

Later Banks, who was born in Fife, 
Scotland, used his website Banksophilia, set up to provide updates on 
his health, to thank his fans for their support.

He said: ‘I feel treasured. I am deeply flattered and touched, and I can’t deny I’ve been made to feel very special indeed.’

Last month he added: ‘Still knocked 
out by the love and depth of feeling coming from so many people; thank 
you, all of you. It means a lot, almost more than I can say, and – 
whatever type or size of screen I read the comments on – I come away 
from the computer, laptop, iPad or phone with a happy smile on my face.’

Before he died, Banks decided to write thank-you letters to his favourite authors telling them how much he valued their work.

Award-winning: Banks was named by The Times newspaper as one of the 50 greatest living authors in 2008

The author said he did not expect to live longer than a year and died of cancer just two months after announcing he was terminally ill

Banks published his first novel The Wasp Factory in 1984 and his debut sci-fi title, Consider Phlebas, came three years later.

The Crow Road, which opens with the 
memorable line ‘It was the day my grandmother exploded’, was adapted for
a popular television series in 1996. In 2008 Banks was named as one of 
the 50 greatest British writers since 1945.

The Quarry describes the physical and 
emotional strains in the final weeks of Guy, who has terminal cancer and
is being looked after by his teenage son.

It reveals the difficulties Guy faces, from using a walking frame to his opposition to alternative treatments.

Crime writer Ian Rankin, a friend of 
Banks for many years, paid tribute to his sense of humour, saying: ‘He 
was refusing to take cancer seriously, in the same way that he refused 
to take life seriously. He was a great guy to hang around with and 
somebody for whom life and the world were a fictional template for him 
to do as he pleased.’

Sci-fi author Ken McLeod said: ‘I 
think he has left us a very  significant body of work, both in 
mainstream literature and science fiction and he’s also left a large gap
in the Scottish literary scene  as well as the wider English-speaking 
world.’

Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh said: ‘I’m off out to the pub to toast one of my all time literary heroes with a malt.’

The gallbladder concentrates and stores bile from the liver as part of the digestive system. Gallbladder cancer is rare in the UK but is more common among women.

It does not cause symptoms in the early stages, grows quickly and is often not diagnosed until the cancer has spread.

Most early-stage cancers are found by chance. At more advanced stages, symptoms include jaundice, abdominal pain and nausea. If the cancer is diagnosed early enough, surgery is the most effective treatment.

As it advances it can spread to lymph nodes, the liver and other organs. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used to stem its spread but only one patient in ten with advanced gallbladder cancer survives for five years.

Vanda Taylor, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Gallbladder cancer is seldom diagnosed early and therefore can be very difficult to treat successfully.’
