It is globally recognised as the safe option for any weary traveler who fears the local cuisine may unravel their sensitive stomach.

But it transpires that McDonald's restaurants are not all as similar as once thought.

The cosmic outlet in Roswell, New Mexico - appropriately designed to look like a spaceship - is world's apart from the one in India that sells local delicacies from a restaurant embossed in Bollywood posters.

More conservative eaters will be comforted by the presence of a Big Mac on every menu but there are also chances to experiment with watered-down versions of regional favourites. 

It would be difficult to bring in 68 million daily customers in 119 countries, across 35,000 outlets and an annual revenue stream of over £18billion without considering cultural differences - and stereotypes.

So you can ski up to a warm looking lodge for your McNuggets in Lindvallen, Sweden or enjoy a lakeside view under the mystic hills of Yangshuo in China.

And the Camembert croquettes in Morocco, spicy paneer wraps in North-East India and a pulled pork burger in Japan that takes four hours to prepare could be proof that not all McDonald's are made equal. 

Out of this world: The McDonald's restaurant in Roswell, New Mexico - the site of an alleged UFO crash-landing in 1947 - is rather appropriately designed as a neon space ship

The boss: Don't be fooled by the humble appearance of this McDonald's restaurant in the Old Delhi district in India, that serves up regional delicacies such as the McPaneer wrap and

Ski-stop: The snowy resort in Lindvallen, Sweden houses the world's first 'ski-thru' where customers can slope up to the counter before hitting the pistes again

Happy house: This outlet in Dallas, Texas looks like a giant Happy Meal box with giant sculptures of French fries, Big Mac's and Ronald McDonald plastered all over it

Trendsetters: The McDonald's in Japan (pictured) has moved with food trends in the country, serving dishes like the Chicken Tatsuta Burgers and Fillet-o-Ebi which contains rosemary and hibiscus tea

Historic: You cannot order a pint of Guiness in the McDonald's outlets in Dublin, Ireland (pictured) but you might mistake the beautiful building for a local museum

Viva capitalism: Prague's Museum of Communism (pictured) which has immersive workshops, an interrogation room and historical schoolrooms also houses the fast-food chain below

Restoration: Try to spot the discreet McDonald's sign in this restaurant set in an 1850s colonial house in Freeport, Maine which was once owned by a sea captain

 

Golden columns: This former bank in Kristiansand, Norway used to deal with nuggets of gold, not chicken breast

Mirage: Views of sand, sand and more sand is what greets diners at the Negev Desert branch in Israel that does brisk business with tourists passing through the desert on their way to Israel's resort towns

Throwback: Barstow Station McDonald's in California is set in refurbished rail cars and has a towering sign on the water tower for those who might just miss seeing the outlet

Keeping it green: What's the difference: The Golden Arches were painted green in keeping with Sedona, Arizona's zoning ordinances, meaning company had to build a restaurant that blended into the natural setting

It's a McTakeoff: The 20-seater McDonald's housed in a vintage luxury DC-3 plane with red and silver interior seats

Iconic: The colonial era McDonald's, set in a 19th-century Georgian mansion in Hyde Park, New York which local activists saved from being razed by petitioning to give it secured landmark status

Artistic: The Art Deco McDonald's in Melbourne, Australia comes with a retro dining room and neon lights. The building was once the United Kingdom Hotel and was designed by architect James Hastie Wardrop
