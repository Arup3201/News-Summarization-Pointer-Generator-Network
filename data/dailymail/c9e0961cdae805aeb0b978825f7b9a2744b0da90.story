A family from Jerusalem's Arab region have been forced to live in a cave after Israeli authorities demolished their home claiming it had been built without a permit.

Khaled al-Zeer al-Husaini, 39, lives with his five children in a wooden shack built around the entrance of a cave which was once used as an animals' stable.

Three days ago, Israeli authorities pulled down his East Jerusalem family home, under the pretext of planning laws, forcing the father to seek shelter in the Silwan-based cave.

The holy city of Jerusalem has been divided between the Israeli and Palestinian territories for many decades, but Israeli settlements have gradually been sprawling further east occupying areas over the border-line.

According to the Foundation for Middle East Peace, nearly 7,000 Israeli settlers moved into east Jerusalem in 2010 and the number is steadily rising. Arab East Jerusalem is now home to almost 200,000 Israelis - up from 175,000 in 2002.

Tensions have been rising these last few days between Israel and its neighbour, and violence has halted planned peace talks.

This week Palestinian officials called off a planned round of peace talks after Israeli soldiers killed three protesters during clashes following an arrest raid in the West Bank.

Permit: Israeli authorities said their home did not have the right building permit and so it was demolished. They are now sheltering in a cave in Silwan

The father has salvaged some of the family's possessions to make the cave as homely as possible

The family's home was demolished three days ago as violence escalated between Israel and Palestine; peace talks between the two sides have been temporarily halted

The violence, the deadliest incident 
in the area in years, dealt a new blow to U.S.-led peace efforts, which 
resumed late last month after a nearly five-year break.

Palestinian
officials have accused the Israelis of stonewalling and using the 
process as a cover to build new Jewish settlements. The deaths of 
Palestinians further soured the atmosphere.

It
was not known when talks will resume, but Palestinian officials said 
the break was expected to be brief. They spoke anonymously as they were 
not authorized to talk to media.

Monday's clashes broke out when 
Israeli forces entered the Qalandia refugee camp, just outside of 
Jerusalem, on an overnight arrest raid.

The small shack, built at the entrance to the cave, was formerly a stable for animals

Salvage: Searching through the wreckage of his home, Khaled is forced to salvage what he can to make the cave liveable for his family

Shai
Hakimi, a spokesman for the paramilitary border police, said hundreds 
of Palestinians poured into the streets and hurled firebombs, concrete 
blocks and rocks at officers.

The
Israeli military said soldiers rushed to the scene to provide backup 
and opened fire after they felt their lives were in "imminent danger."

The Palestinians want discussions to focus on security issues and the border between Israel and a future state of Palestine.

U.S.
Secretary of State John Kerry is expected to meet Israel's prime 
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Rome on Sept. 8 to help push 
negotiations forward, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials.
