One is a Chelsea girl currently preparing to follow her rapper beau Professor Green on his festival tour, the other a bubbly blonde TV presenter in a high profile relationship with the Duchess of Cambridge's brother James Middleton.

But whether it's getting festival-ready or dressed up for a night out with the Royals, Millie Mackintosh and Donna Air both share the same little beauty secret when it comes to achieving their gorgeous glow.

The famous duo are both fans of Johnson's Baby Light Oil Spray.

Shared secret: Millie Mackintosh and Donna Air may not have any things in common but they both swear by Johnson's Baby Light Oil Spray to give them a summer glow

For many, this £2.99 product conjures memories of childhood, but for the two stars, it is the secret to red carpet ready skin.

The spray, which promises 'baby soft skin in seconds', is designed to lock in moisture and absorb quickly, making it ideal for girls on the go.

Big babies: The duo love the spray because it helps keep their skin moisturised and give them a perfect red carpet glow

Speaking about her favourite product, Millie Mackintosh, 23, said: 'The Johnson's Baby Light Oil Spray is quickly becoming one of my beauty must-haves.

'My job involves getting ready for last minute appearances, so I'm keeping a bottle in my beauty bag ready for those red carpet moments.'

And the Quality Street heiress will no doubt be packing it in her rucksack as she prepares to accompany Professor Green to the likes of Glastonbury festival and Ibiza Rocks.

Donna Air, 33, who has recently been frequenting the Mayfair nightlife scene with the Royals, added: 'The smell of it really takes me back, I love it!

'I am currently addicted to the Baby Light Oil Spray as it's fantastic for giving my arms and legs a subtle sheen, especially in the summer when they are on show more.'

Other famous fans of the Johnson's baby range include Victoria Beckham, who Tweeted a picture of their baby oil with the caption: 'Travel tip, after regimen put a layer of baby oil over face. Protects skin on plane, locks in moisture.'

Hollywood star Jessica Alba has also raved about the brand before saying:' I highlight my skin using a pea-sized amount of Baby Oil mixed with my usual moisturiser to create a subtle shimmer.'

Other A-list fans include Reese Witherspoon, Nicola Roberts and Fearne Cotton.
