It seems that when a hit from Disney's Frozen is played in public, some people just can't help themselves from joining in. 

A video of a 21-year-old woman enthusiastically miming along to the song 'Let It Go' from the popular film in the middle of busy high street has gone viral after it was uploaded to the internet by her friends. 

Speakers outside Debenhams in Portsmouth were playing the hit when Kimberley Jane saw her chance and leapt on to the makeshift 'podium'.

Kimberley said: 'I was just walking through town. They were turning the Christmas lights on and Frozen came on the loud speakers.

'I saw people miming to it and I was singing as well.

'I had nothing to lose so I just did it, I just thought this is my moment. The music just got to me and I just let it go.

'My friend recorded it on his phone and put it online. I didn't know he was recording it. It might have looked a little bit stupid but it was completely impromptu.

The Frozen film has taken the world by storm since its release in November last year 

'I am in shock. People are saying I'm brave and I'm a hero. But I don't consider myself to be any of those things - I'm just a girl with a good sense of humour.

'I love the film. It's one of my favourites. I know all the words. It's about courage and determination and that's what I brought in my performance.

'Other people weren't brave enough. They were just conforming to normal life.

'What wasn't caught on camera was a massive group of people surrounding me watching and enjoying it.'

Perry Osborne, from Portsmouth, uploaded to video to his Facebook and is amazed at the attention it's received.

The 21-year-old captioned the video 'That moment Frozen comes on in public!'

He added: 'It's crazy, I can't believe it.'
