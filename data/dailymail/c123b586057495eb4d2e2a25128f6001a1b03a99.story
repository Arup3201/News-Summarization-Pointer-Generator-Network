Cameroon have finally arrived in Rio de Janeiro for their World Cup campaign after originally refusing to board an earlier flight in a strike over their payment for the tournament.

The team stayed back at their hotel in Yaounde on Sunday while reporters camped outside the Cameroon Football Federation headquarters for further information.

High hopes: Cameroon, managed by German coach Volker Finke (above left), face Mexico first up

A charter plane was due to leave Yaounde on Sunday morning for Brazil, where Cameroon play their opening game of the tournament against Mexico on Friday.

Cameroon players had last week threatened to go on strike until they received promised payment for participating at the World Cup but suspended the strike ahead of their international friendly against Germany last Sunday, the French sports paper L'Equipe reported.

But Chelsea man Samuel Eto'o and Barcelona midfielder Alex Song looked in good spirits as they exited the plane at Galeao Aerial Base.
