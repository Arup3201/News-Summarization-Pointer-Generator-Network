Thousands of South Korean police stormed a religious compound today as they searched for a fugitive businessman wanted in connection with April's ferry disaster.

Donning riot gear, officers forced their way into the sprawling church and complex in Anseong, 50 miles south of Seoul, at around 8am (12am GMT).

They were hunting billionaire Yoo Byung-eun, who is believed to own the vessel that sank, leaving more than 300 people dead or missing.

It comes a day after 15 crew members of the doomed Sewol ferry, which sank off the southwest coast of South Korea on April 16, went on trial in Gwangju.

Captain Lee Joon-seok, 68, and three senior crew members have been charged with homicide - a charge that could carry the death penalty.

Two others have been charged with fleeing and abandoning ship, with a maximum sentence of life in prison, while nine are accused of negligence, which can also carry jail terms.

Yoo, who has been the focus of a large hunt by police and prosecutors for weeks, is also believed to have contributed to the ferry sinking on April 16 through his alleged corruption.

Authorities are offering a $500,000 (£300,000) reward for tips about the 
businessman, who is a member of the Evangelical Baptist Church, deemed a
 'cult' by critics.

In their latest move, around 6,000 police officers, accompanied by prosecution investigators, raided the group's extensive compound this morning, according to an unnamed officer.

Four church members were detained for allegedly providing shelter for the businessman or helping him flee, while another was held for reportedly trying to obstruct the raid. 

Police say they are still trying to find and detain more church members for allegedly aiding Yoo. It is not clear whether the businessman himself was at the compound at the time of the raid. 

Arrests: During today's raid, four church members were detained for allegedly providing shelter for the businessman or helping him flee. Meanwhile, another was held for reportedly trying to obstruct the raid

Around 200 church members rallied against the raid, with some holding up a large banner, reading: 'We'll protect Yoo Byung-eun even if 100,000 church members are all arrested.'

Yoo, head of the now-defunct predecessor of the ferry's current operator, Chonghaejin, allegedly still controls the company through a complex web of holding companies.

His children and close associates are reportedly large shareholders - and the government has offered a $100,000 (£60,000) bounty for Yoo's eldest son.

The Sewol ferry sinking, one of South Korea's deadliest disasters in decades, happened during a routine journey from Incheon on the mainland to the 
southern holiday island of Jeju.

Disaster: The Sewol ferry, carrying 476 people, sank off the southwest coast of South Korea on April 16

Rescue: Only 172 people were rescued from the vessel and the remainder are all presumed to have drowned

Of the 476 passengers and crew on board, 339 were children and teachers from the same school on the outskirts of Seoul.

Only 172 people were rescued and the remainder are all presumed to have drowned.

Divers continue underwater searches for those believed trapped inside the sunken ship off the country's southwestern coast.

Members
 of the crew were caught on video abandoning ship - including the captain in his 
underwear - while the children, obeying orders, waited in their cabins 
for further instructions.

Court case: Today's raid comes a day after 15 crew members of the doomed ferry went on trial in Gwangju. Above, Captain Lee Joon-seok is surrounded by members of the press as he arrives at the court by bus

Standing trial: Captain Lee arrives at court yesterday. He and three senior crew are charged with homicide

As the defendants were led in to court yesterday, someone shouted: 'That guy is the captain, isn't he? Murderer!'

Meanwhile, one
 relative held up a sign that read: 'You are not human. You are beneath 
animals.'

In
 a statement sent to reporters via text message and read out by a 
representative before the hearing, a committee of ferry victims' 
families demanded strict punishment of the crew.

'They say wounds heal as time goes by, but, for us, it's like time has stopped,' the statement said.

Emotional: Family members of passengers aboard the sunken ferry Sewol struggle with a security officer, right, while attempting to attend the trial of the ferry's crew members at Gwangju District Court yesterday

'The
 defendants, who should have saved the passengers first, ran out first 
and lived... The defendants not only killed the passengers, they also 
killed the souls of the families and basic trust in our society.'

All
 surviving crew members responsible for the ship's navigation have been 
charged with negligence and with failing to do their duty to protect 
passengers.

The 15 on trial have been in detention since they were charged in May.

The trial continues.
