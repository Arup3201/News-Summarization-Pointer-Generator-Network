A New York woman is suing a tights manufacturing company because their product didn't give her the orgasmic experience she had hoped for.

Meng Wang, of Queens, purchased a pair of Kushyfoot shaping tights for $7 at Duane Reade and was disappointed -- or unsatisfied -- when she didn't have some sort of orgasmic experience that the woman in the company's advertising commercial had, according to the New York Post. 

In the sexually suggestive commercial for the pantyhose, a woman is seen walking down the street, seemingly in the throes of passion.

A New York woman, Meng Wang, is suing a tights manufacturing company because the product didn't give her sexual pleasure as allegedly advertised in the product's sexually suggestive commercial

Between moans, the woman says 'that's the spot,' and 'oh yeah, that's it.' 

At the end of the commercial, the woman is surrounded by a group of women eager to know her secret and the woman pulls a package of the stockings from her purse and says 'Kushyfoot.' 

All the while, a chorus is heard in the background singing 'I'm super satisfied, super satisfied.'

Apparently, Wang wasn't 'super satisfied.'

She filed a class action lawsuit in Brooklyn Monday against the Canadian based company Gildan Outerwear.

Kushyfoot: At the end of the commercial, the woman is surrounded by a group of women eager to know her secret and the woman pulls a package of the stockings from her purse and says 'Kushyfoot'

Wang's lawyer, C.K.Lee, told the Post that the advertisement indicated that Wang would get 'a massage through her pantyhose.' 

But the product turned out to be 'just socks,' he said. Wang purchased the shaping tights and wore them for a week, the suit claims, but experienced no pleasurable sensations.

The product's description on the Kushyfoot website claims the shaping tights include a 'massaging sole for extra comfort' and a 'firm shaper that tames your tummy, hips and thighs.'

Misleading: The suit claims that the tights manufacturer used unreliable and misleading language to describe the product and that Wang relied on the 'tension relief and massage claims'

According to the class action suit, Wang is seeking 'redress for deceptive and otherwise improper business practices.' 

The suit claims that the tights manufacturer used unreliable and misleading language to describe the product and that Wang relied on the 'tension relief and massage claims.'

The suit also states that Wang relied on the company's 'tension relief and massage claims' but Wang said the product did not improve her bodily comfort, according to PIX 11.
