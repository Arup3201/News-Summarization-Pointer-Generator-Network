If working through your lunch break wasn't depressing enough, then there's more bad news.

Eating in front of your screen is also bad for your figure - with half of people polled for a survey admitting they had piled on the pounds from doing so.

This was largely caused by office workers binging on crisps, chocolate and Coke at their desks rather than taking a proper break and eating healthier food. They also used junk food as a 'reward' for working so hard, the survey found.

The survey also found the traditional lunch hour was very much a thing of the past.

Whereas 10 years ago ago, 85 per cent of
 office staff took a lunch hour every day - now just 18 per cent do so 
because of added work pressures.

Around 40 per cent of respondents had lunch at their desk every day - and a further 20 per cent said they did this most days.

Only 21 per cent said they never ate lunch at their desk.

The study found that 58 per cent of workers felt under pressure to work through their lunch breaks despite craving a rest. A fifth took fewer than 15 minutes and the vast majority took no more than half an hour. 

But eating at the desk can cause serious weight gain. Almost half of people confessed they were more likely to eat junk food at their desks.

Sixty per cent regularly ate chocolate or crisps or soft drinks from office vending machines - and then felt guilty afterwards. 

The results came in a new survey for the diet firm Forza Supplements, which found increasingly rushed work patterns were playing havoc with people’s diets.

Although home-made sandwiches were the most popular choice, more than a third 
of workers ate more than 1,200 calories during a typical working day 
when their lunch was combined with drinks such as coffee and teas or 
soft drinks and vending machine snacks.

Weight gain was largely caused by office workers binging on crisps, chocolate and Coke at their desks rather than taking a proper break and eating healthier food. We also use junk food as a 'reward' for working so hard

A woman’s recommended daily calorie intake is 2,000 calories and it is 2,500 calories for a man.

Lee Smith, managing director of Forza supplements, said: 'Gone are the days when we would go out for lunch and socialise with workmates.

'More of us are office bound and slaves to our computers. Unfortunately that is very bad news for diets because we haven’t got the time to seek out healthier, less calorific foods.

“We are binging on crisps, chocolates and cans of coke. People are giving themselves these treats as reward when they do something well at work or to break up the daily routine.

He added: 'Sandwiches are far more fattening than most people realise. Even those at outlets such as Pret, which rely on natural ingredients, can easily top 500 calories.'

Most people who did take a break only took half an hour or less

Experts warn that not having a break leads us to 'reward' ourselves with fattening foods, rather seeking out healthy alternatives
