A soldier who survived the Somme and fought at Ypres was left for dead after being shot in the stomach at Passchendale, his son has revealed.

The body of Robert Collie was then thrown onto a heap of corpses while he was still alive and he was only saved after a passing India medic saw him twitching.

He survived his wounds and returned to the fighting, serving in India after World War I finished and rising through the ranks from Private to Major.

William 'Robert' Collie survived the Somme and Ypres before being left for dead after being shot during Passchedale. He was thrown onto a pile of bodies but saved when a passing medic saw him twitch

Sadly Collie lost both of his brothers after they were wounded in action during the war, and his sister who was killed by a Zeppelin during a bombing raid in London.

The story of the Scottish soldier who refused to die has only now come to light after his son, also called Robert, decided to sell his 13 medals.

Robert, 75, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, said: 'My father was a tough Scotsman and not a lot phased him.

'But the loss of his elder and younger brother and sister in such a short space of time must have been the most terrible thing to endure.

'He hardly ever spoke about the war when he was alive. I managed to get a few things out of him but the rest I have found out on the internet.

Major Collie earned 13 medals during his service. From left to right, they are: MBE, 1914 Star, 1914-18 War medal, Victory medal, 1939-45 Star, Burma Star, World War II War medal, 1939-45 India medal, 1935 and 1937 Commemorative medals,George IV and Queen Elizabeth Coronation medal, George V Long Service medal, George V Meritorious Service medal

The medal set and paperwork are being sold by Robert's son, also called Robert, and may fetch £1,200

'He fought at the Somme where the Allies lost 57,000 men on the first day. He fought at Ypres and was badly wounded at Passchendale.

'His colleagues thought he was dead and he was thrown on a load of dead bodies.

'An Indian doctor then saw him twitch and pulled him off and treated him and saved his life. Within a year and was back fighting again.'

As well as dealing with his own personal grief, Major Collie had to deal with the deaths of his two brothers.

The eldest brother, William, enlisted as a Private with the Canadian Infantry in 1916. He had emigrated to Toronto from Dufftown, in Banffshire, after marrying his bride, Agnes.

Alongside the medals Collie, who was a talented boxer, was presented with this inscribed box for his services to the sport in Calcutta where he served after the First World War finished

The father-of-six was listed as missing assumed killed in action during the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917 aged just 37.

His body was never found and his name appears on the Huntly and Mortlach War Memorials in Scotland.

Little is known about Maj Collie's younger brother John.

He served as a private in the Gordon Highlanders Regiment and died in 1916. Maj Collie saw his brother at Dover with severe injuries to his legs which he never recovered from.

Even once the war was over the heartbreak did not end for Collie as his wife, Ida, became ill with tuberculosis in 1933 and also died.

Sadly 15 years after the war which killed his two brothers and sister finished, Collie was bereft again by the untimely death of his wife Ida. He then married his second wife Kathleen before going on to have children

Robert, a semi-retired accountant, added: 'My father met and married my mother, Kathleen, while she worked as a children's nurse in Calcutta in 1937 and I was born a year later.

'I inherited the medals from him. My two children don't really want them and I thought I would look to give them a good home now.'

His impressive medal set comprises of the MBE, 1914 Star, 1914-18 War medal, Victory medal, 1939-45 Star, Burma Star, World War II War medal, 1939-45 India medal, 1935 and 1937 Commemorative medals, George IV and Queen Elizabeth Coronation medal, George V Long Service medal, George V Meritorious Service medal.

Collie was also a talented boxer and the collection includes white metal box with the inscription 'Presented to Lt. R. Collie M.B.E., I.C.C. for Services Rendered to Army Boxing 1936-38 by The Military Boxing Committee, Calcutta'.

The medals are being sold by Eastbourne Auctions and are expected to fetch £1,200.

Auctioneer Jeanette May said: 'Major Collie's is a incredible story that is tinged with great personal tragedy and sadness yet he mustered up the strength to carry on fighting.'
