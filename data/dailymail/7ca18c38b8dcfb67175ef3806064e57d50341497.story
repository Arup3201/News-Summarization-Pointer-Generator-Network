Arrested: Zeguang Xu, 19, was said to be at the wheel of his Maserati when he ran a red light in 30mph zone in the upmarket Back Bay neighborhood in Boston

A wealthy Chinese student has been arrested after allegedly driving at more than 100mph in a 30mph zone without a licence.

Zeguang Xu, 19, was  at the wheel of his $126,500 Maserati Gran Turismo, which has a top speed of 177mph, when he ran a red light in the upmarket Back Bay neighborhood in Boston, police have said.

The undergraduate student at Boston University's College of Arts and Social Science had a woman in the car when he was stopped and allegedly told officers the vehicle belonged to a friend.

A police report said he also claimed that he had left his wallet and licence at home before giving a fake name and address.

However the female passenger took the car home when she confirmed Xu was the owner.

When pushed by officers, he then handed over his wallet and his Boston University ID. 

According to the Boston Herald, he pleaded not guilty today in Boston Municipal Court to charges of operating without a license, providing a false name to police, speeding, failure to stop, and negligent operation. 

He was released from custody after posting $1,000 bail. 

Suffolk District Attorney Daniel Conley said: 'High speeds, poor driving conditions — this could have been a recipe for disaster. We're very fortunate no one was hurt, including the driver himself.'

The intersection where Xu was caught speeding is the same place where two pedestrians were killed earlier this summer.

A senior analyst at Kantar Retail, and John 'Jack' Lanzillotti, the Emmy Award-winning manager of Red Sox Productions and Game Operations, were killed when Yemen native Mohamed Alfageeh, 30, allegedly ran a red light and flipped his SUV in June. 

He is due in court on May 18 to face two counts of motor vehicle homicide.

Colin Riley, spokesman for the university, told the Herald he could not speak specifically about Xu's status because of privacy laws but said: 'Certainly what is described here is reckless and dangerous. We hold students accountable when they're arrested for violations of student-conduct policies. We'll get the police report and go from there.'
