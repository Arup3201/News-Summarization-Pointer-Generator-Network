Most people receive letters, bills and packages of items they've ordered in the mail.

But one woman was shocked when a postal worker turned up at her door - with 15 baby chickens.

Alongside the live birds was a  note from the woman's ex-boyfriend, making a crude comparison between the animals and her. It simply read: 'There are lots of other chicks out there'.

An unwelcome package: A Washington woman received these 15 baby chickens in the mail, alongside a note from her ex-boyfriend, comparing the animals to her. It read: 'There are lots of other chicks out there'

Fluffy: Following the delivery, the unidentified ex-girlfriend reportedly told the postal worker she was planning to throw the chicks in the trash bin outside her Washington home. Above, one of the baby animals

Following the delivery, the unidentified ex-girlfriend reportedly told the postal worker she was planning to throw the chicks in the trash bin outside her Washington home. 

He subsequently took back the animals and delivered them to the Washington Humane Society, which in turn, transferred the birds to Poplar Springs Animal Sanctuary in Poolesville, Maryland.

'Unbelievably it is legal to ship baby chicks in the regular mail, and often this results in injuries or death to the babies,' said the sanctuary on its Facebook page.

Although one of the chickens suffered  an injured leg, all 15 of the birds are now on the road to recovery. Nine are being cared for in a playpen under a heat lamp at Poplar Spring.

Meanwhile, the remaining six have been transferred to Peaceful Fields Sanctuary in Virginia.

'The chicks are all doing well. There is one with an injured leg, but she is improving. They all appear very active and healthy,' Terry Cummings,  Poplar Spring co-founder, told The Huffington Post.

She added: 'I was very surprised by this story, I thought I had heard everything, but this was a new one. Definitely had never heard of baby chicks being used as a spiteful statement after a breakup.

'None of this would have happened if it were illegal to ship chickens in the mail.'

According to a WHS spokesman, the unidentified boyfriend would likely have escaped prosecution for mailing the baby chickens.

However, the woman could have faced criminal charges for animal cruelty if she had dumped the animals in the trash, she said.  

The United States Postal Service details its rules for mailing live birds on its website.
