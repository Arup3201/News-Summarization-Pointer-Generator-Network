The family of an 83-year-old dementia sufferer have criticised a care home after he died in squalid conditions.

Gordon Papworth's family have said they complained to managers 30 times after he moved into the £600-a-week Burkitt Care Home, in West Bridgford, Nottingham, last January.

The family contacted managers to complain about the condition of the home, but they say nothing was done and Mr Papworth died six months later on June 16.

His widow Joan, 77, today said the floors of the care home were soaked with urine and the bedding was smeared with faeces.

She claimed patients were given spaghetti hoops on toast almost every day for dinner, while staff were poorly trained and overwhelmed by the task of caring for residents who mainly suffered from dementia-related conditions.

Mr Papworth's family have said despite contacting managers 30 times to complain nothing was done.

Mrs Papworth, 77, who was married to retired agricultural worker Gordon for 60 years, said: 'I was so angry. I was complaining every day in the end.

'All his pension money went into the care home; it just didn’t seem fair. The stench of the place took your breath away and there was urine on the floor.

'I complained because I wanted to give them a wake-up call. The mattresses were stuck together with faeces, it was disgusting.

'Some of the staff were brilliant, but 
they just could not cope. On one occasion we visited my husband and the 
staff had dressed him in another resident’s clothes and had another 
gentleman’s glasses on.

'They clearly had no idea what they were doing.'

The couple’s daughter Suzette Harris, 59, said she was so disgusted with the food given to residents she cooked her own and took it into her father.

She said: 'He used to have spaghetti hoops on toast almost every night. We ended up feeding him ourselves.'

The Care Quality Commission (CQC) have ordered the care home to make urgent changes

The family lodged a complaint with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) who ordered the care home to make urgent changes.

A spokesman for Nelsons Solicitors, on behalf of Burkitt Care Home, said a number of measures had been put in place to prevent the issues highlighted by the family.

'All his pension money went into the care
 home; it just didn’t seem fair. The stench of the place took your 
breath away and there was urine on the floor'

These included assessing care needs and mobility on a regular basis and monitoring and recording food intake.

The home submitted a report to the CQC last September addressing the complaints.

After an inspection in December CQC experts published a damning report revealing they had found mattresses that appeared to be stuck together with faeces and urine, poorly-trained staff and a poor record for allowing bed sores to develop in residents.

The commission also noted that a manager at the home insisted that one particular resident - identified as a vegetarian - 'sometimes eats meat'.

It has told the home it must produce a plan to turn its performance around. Nottinghamshire County Council also confirmed that it had suspended its contract with the home.
