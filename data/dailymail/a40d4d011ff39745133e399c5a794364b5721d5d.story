Chelsea may not be able to claim that Kurt Zouma is a product of their youth set-up, but the French youngster is quickly becoming the next big thing at Stamford Bridge.

Zouma, who has only just turned 20, put in another impeccable performance during Chelsea's 2-0 victory against Newcastle on Saturday.

For much of the season, the defensive partnership of Gary Cahill and Terry has provided a firm base for a Chelsea side looking to win their first Premier League title since 2010, but that was until the shock 5-3 defeat against rivals Tottenham on New Year's Day.

Zouma marshalled the right side of Chelsea's defence at Stamford Bridge on Saturday 

Cahill, in particular, had a game to forget at White Hart Lane and was lucky not to have been shown a red card for a kick on Harry Kane in the second half. 

The England vice-captain often has to bear the brunt of the criticism from Chelsea fans should the Blues succumb to a defeat and many would have been pleased to see Zouma alongside stalwart Terry at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

Strong, quick and confident in possession, Zouma has all the tools to become a star in west London. He's not bad in the opposition's box either, scoring more goals (two) in his first season for Chelsea than much-maligned striker Fernando Torres did during his first term in a blue shirt.

One thing that cannot be questioned is his bravery on the field. Zouma showed his commitment to the cause during Chelsea's 3-1 Capital One Cup quarter-final win against Derby after being clattered by Petr Cech as the pair attempted to clear a corner. 

The defender was knocked to the floor from a Derby corner and received treatment for seven minutes as the first half drew to a close.

Zouma has now played in Chelsea's last two games and the Blues having conceded a goal, while scoring five at the other end. He made 87 per cent of his passes on Saturday, won three duels and three recoveries.

Those at Stamford Bridge on Saturday will also have noticed Terry giving regular instructions to the 20-year-old as the Blues captain looks to mould Zouma into a force to be reckoned with. He's already becoming somewhat of a cult hero in SW6, with fans around the ground chanting his surnames repeatedly. 

In fact, it was Zouma who looked the more assured defender during a poor first 45 minutes from Terry which saw the former England captain easily beaten by Remy Cabella and Moussa Sissoko as Chelsea struggled to click into gear before an Oscar striker settled the nerves.

As Chelsea grew in confidence, so did Zouma, bursting out of defence with the ball on more than one occasion as he looked to drive his team forward. 

Zouma's chances have been limited this season, the the Frenchman has impressed when selected

Jose Mourinho signed Zouma from St Etienne for a fee of £12.5million last year

Terry may be playing some of the best football of his career this season, but at 34, Mourinho must at least start to think about his eventual replacement.

The Portuguese manager may have to look no further than his £12.5million signing should Zouma continue to put in such impressive performances when called upon.

On the flipside, Zouma could actually help prolong Terry's career at the heart of the Chelsea defence. Despite Terry's age, the pair still have time to form a perfect partnership in which Zouma's pace and exuberance can dovetial with his skipper's experiences and reading of the game. 

Chelsea fans have also understandably been quick to mention Marcel Desailly's name when watching Zouma grace the Stamford Bridge turf.

The former Blues captain was a commanding presence both on and off the field, and has rightly gone down as one of the Stamford Bridge greats.

It would perhaps be unfair to make such early comparisons, but Zouma looks to possess the same leggy gate and similar characteristics to Desailly and is quick to try and make a tackle unlike Cahill who is often guilty of gifting opposing forwards too much space.

Assistant coach Steve Holland labelled Zouma's performance as 'immaculate' while Blues boss Mourinho heaped praise on the former St Etienne man following his impressive display against Watford.

Mourinho said recently: 'He [Zouma] had another good game

'He made mistakes in pre-season. But apart from that, his outstanding physical condition and the way he sees the game and makes decision are very good.'

Terry admits that learning from the likes of Michael Duberry, Frank Leboeuf and Desailly greatly improved his game and there's no doubt the 34-year-old will be hoping to provide the same inspiration for Chelsea's French starlet.
