Schalke boss Roberto Di Matteo has admitted that the club could miss out on Real Madrid's defensive midfielder Sami Khedira due to the stiff competition they will face in the transfer market.  

The 27-year-old anchorman is out of contract at the Santiago Bernabeu in the summer and will be available on a free transfer; but factoring in Khedira's obvious quality and reported interest from Arsenal and Manchester United, it is not hard to see why Di Matteo feels signing him will be a challenge.   

The former Chelsea manager told Sport1 on Friday, 'There is not a single coach in the world who would not want to have a player of his calibre in their team.'

 Khedira has made over 150 appearances for Real Madrid since joining the club from Stuttgart in 2010

He added, 'The door is wide open for Khedira. However, I think he is spoilt for choice when it comes to picking his next destination. It will be very difficult to take him to Schalke.'

Khedira joined Madrid from Stuttgart in 2010 and has since made over 150 appearances for Los Blancos, winning La Liga in 2012 and the Champions League in 2014. 

He was also part of Germany's FIFA World Cup winning squad that lifted the trophy in Brazil in July last year.
