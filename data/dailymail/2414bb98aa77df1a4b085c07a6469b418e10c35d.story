Centre Matt Williams choose the perfect stage to score three tries in Wellington’s win over unbeaten Millfield in a heavyweight Daily Mail Schools Trophy clash.

Watched by England schools coaches John Fletcher and Peter Walton, Wellington sped to a 41-27 success under the Iffley Road floodlights in Oxford on Wednesday evening.

The London Irish academy player continued a fruitful autumn where his pace and swerve has helped Wellington to five wins in this merit table-based competition organised by schoolsrugby.co.uk. The only blip came against Dulwich who held the Berkshire school to a 13-13 draw.

Williams, an academic scholar in the lower sixth, was in the England under-16s last season and is expected to be competing for further honours this campaign.

He is part of a quick backline including full-back Tom Parton, who also contributed a try against Millfield, and wing Tom Papke who scored two tries in last Saturday’s 43-0 win over Harrow. To finish a hectic week for Wellington they play at Eton on Saturday. Besides the pace of Williams and co, Wellington were also well served by goal-kicking No 8 and captain Will Wilson who amassed 21 points.

Wellington’s draw against Dulwich leaves them in the chasing pack behind the unbeaten leaders in the Grammar School at Leeds who edged out RGS Newcastle, 24-21.

Hull-based Hymers College are another unbeaten team. They posted a fifth win in a narrow 23-17 success at home to Durham. Lock Charlie Ward, centre Tom Jones and the versatile James Nettleton, who fits in at centre or flanker, scored tries.

Hymers are benefitting from a successful year group who have now reached their final season. “They have stuck together from the under-12s and are playing well,’ reported coach Paul Huntsman.

Sedbergh, who are scheduled to face Wellington at the Broad Street club in Coventry on Nov 11, were inspired to a 39-10 win over King’s Macclesfield by full-back Johnny McPhillips who scored 19 points.

King’s found the Sedbergh forwards too strong but had previously toppled last year’s champions Woodhouse Grove.

A 41-12 win, featuring four tries from No 8 Archie Thorneycroft, avenged the 16-14 defeat of last October when Grove won thanks to a late drop goal by Charles Morgan.
