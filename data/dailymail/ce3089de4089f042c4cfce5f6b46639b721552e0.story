They are not the first places which come to mind when making a  booking, but as these pictures show, there are some rather interesting restaurant loos in the UK. 

There has been an increase in restaurants providing much more than just a meal, and as these designer toilets show, restaurants are now fighting to make themselves more memorable.

Whether it's the incredible views at Aqua Shard, Sketch's futuristic pods or Abracadabra's X-rated sink ornaments, the loo is another chance for a venue to impress, and restaurants are grasping this opportunity with both hands.

'Over the last few years we've seen a marked increase in restaurants that provide much more than just a meal to the customer; these venues use every aspect of their customer experience to pack a real punch and make themselves more memorable,' said Josephine Ellis, European Head of Communications at Bookatable.co.uk. 

'A big part of this has been designer toilets which often surprise diners with their fun and quirky designs at a point during a meal when all we really expect to see are cubicles and sinks,' she continued. 

From loos running retro nature documentaries and pre-warmed toilet seats which powder your bum once you've finished to phallic tap fittings and rusty cans serving as urinals, here at 14 of the UK's strangest loos.

1. Sketch Gallery, Mayfair

Some wonderfully weird cocooned pods comprise the intergalactic space-age landscape in the Sketch Gallery lavatories. Whilst you are in the dinosaur-egg pod, your ears will be treated to the soothing sounds of retro nature documentaries. Oh, and there are Victorian maids, just to further enhance the already esoteric setting.

2. The Bell Inn, East Sussex

Who would have thought that a trumpet could double as a urinal? The Bell Inn prove that you can simultaneously blow your horn and take a leak in their trumpet urinals. Hitting all the right notes with their wonderful quirks and boutique artefacts, The Bell Inn is a hidden restaurant and inn with bold-as-brass swagger in Ticehurst, East Sussex.

3. Crazy Bear, Fitzrovia

Not that we'd encourage illicit voyeurism but at Crazy Bear it's all too easy to get a glimpse into the dark side via the dazzlingly glam, open communal sinks. You enter via a concealed mirrored door, but be warned: all that glitters is seemingly not gold. With all the mirror action it can be tricky to distinguish male and females loos apart so take care not to accidentally intrude.

4. Ta Bouche Restaurant and Bar, Cambridge

Having made a real splash with their innovative video game toilets, Captive Media are on a mission to revolutionise lavatorial interior design. Even though they were rebuffed on Dragon's Den, they have gone onto furnish numerous restaurant bars with video game urinals, including venues in London and Cambridge. Open into the wee small hours, Ta Bouche Restaurant and Bar is surely the front-runner for toilet gaming technology in Cambridge.

5. M Restaurants, The City

These Japanese-heated toilets at swanky M Restaurants treat you to a proper pampering session: a nifty little control panel means that you can choose massaging water motions and complete your Tokyo-style toilet experience with drying air jets and a spot of powdering. You'll never think about a 'wash and blow dry' in the same way again.

6. Aqua Shard, London Bridge

Aqua Shard wins the prize in the stakes for adrenaline-fuelled toilet highs. You can take in the spectacular London skyline with these city-slicking powder rooms 31 floors up, surrounded by 180-degree London views. You've definitely made it when you can say you've answered the call of nature from these lofty heights.

7. The Sun Inn, Edinburgh

Named Scottish Gastropub of The Year in 2011, The Sun Inn near Edinburgh bring their unique brand of boutique style-chic to Lothian Bridge, but it doesn't quite extend as far as the toilets. The gents have some gloriously rustic bucket urinals, meaning each visit really does end up 'in the can.' Simple, yes, but it does the job.

8. Abracadabra, Piccadilly

Talk about shooting from the lip. After less than favourable reviews from restaurant critics , Abracadabra has taken some stick for its lascivious, lipstick-mouthed lavs in the men's. For the ladies there are sophisticated, golden phallic taps. Yes. Gold. Phallic. Taps.  

9. The Attendant, Fitzrovia

This is getting a bit meta. Toilets within toilets? The Attendant's key selling point is the humble water closet and it commodes your attention at every turn. After 50 years lying abandoned, these 19th-century washrooms reveal ornate Fitzrovian porcelains converted into a dining table that's so clean you could eat your dinner off it. Don't worry, it's been mega-deep-cleaned to within an inch of its life. And the toilets aren't bad either.

10. Nopi, Soho

The menu at Nopi is rustic and directional, yet simple. The lavatories are not. A work of dazzling art, you may have trouble upon both entry and escape from these labyrinthine mirror lavatories, like a nostalgic Hall of Mirrors. Be sure to tell your guests that if you're not out in ten, send reinforcements to rescue you from the never-ending mind-trickery of the mirror maze.

11. Mayor of Scaredy Cat Town, Spitalfields

It's all rather cloak and dagger here. You need to ask to 'see the mayor' to get entry via a fridge to this secret speakeasy hangout, before taking a twisted trip back to your childhood via the fake exit door of the My Little Pony-clad lavs. If you're not into the Brony (adult fan of My Little Pony) thing, then you could skip by the Mayor of Scaredy Cat Town.

While Thomas Crapper didn't actually invent the humble toilet, he founded a plumbing company which now lends its name to these authentic retro-style thrones, found in Jamie's Italian, Manchester 

12. Sketch Lecture Room, Mayfair

Love checking the lavs when you visit a restaurant? Sketch features washrooms that just keep on giving, with not just one but two sets of crazy khazis. Lacroix-inspired, crystal-decked creations that are truly worthy of the royal throne mantel can be found on the way to sketch Lecture Room. A departure from the dinosaur space eggs but almost equally intriguing with a distorted fairground soundtrack and spider web-spangled walls of mystery.

13. Shaka Zulu, Camden

Shaka Zulu has earned its stripes in the exotic khazi stakes with a Zebra-zapped world of glorious toilet heaven. No, it's not safari road kill: it's art. It takes a lot of dollar to achieve this simple yet ostentatious pony-stripe effect. 

14 Jamie's Italian, Manchester

Contrary to popular belief, Thomas Crapper didn't actually invent the humble toilet. However, he founded a plumbing company which now lends its name to these authentic retro-style thrones. Jamie Oliver clearly favours an authentic variety of toilet seat and has installed these loos across his restaurant group, including Jamie's Italian in Manchester which features an original Thomas Crapper toilet.
