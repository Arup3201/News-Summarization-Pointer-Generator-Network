As the level-headed detective at the centre of BBC’s hit crime thriller The Killing, Sofie Grabol is rarely seen without the patterned jumper that has become her trademark.

Detective Sarah Lund’s quirky fashion sense spawned a revival of chunky knitwear in high street fashion.

But now designers Gudrun & Gudrun have lost a battle against Danish company Stof og Sy over copyright of their famous ‘Lund’ jumper design.

Character detective Sarah Lund has become as known for her chunky knit jumpers as her cool demeanor

Demand for the traditional style of jumper has sky rocketed since The Killing was picked up by the BBC in 2011

Makers of the jumper, Faroese based company Gudrun & Gudrun, have argued they have an exclusive right over the distinctive star pattern, after Stof og Sy produced a similar, much cheaper, jumper.

While an original Gudrun & Gudrun Lund jumper will set you back £240, the ‘knit it yourself’ kit sold by Stof og Sy is just £40.

The Observer reports that representative for Stof og Sy, Lene Langballe, argued in court that the history behind the pattern meant that despite Gudrun & Gudrun’s protests, they were perfectly within their right to produce it themselves.

The Faroese jumpers worn by lone wolf Sarah Lund are knitted on the island group and archipelago which sits under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark and is situated between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, approximately halfway between Norway and Iceland.

The unusual patterns stitched into the sweaters are a traditional Faroese marking, originally used by the fishermen's wives to distinguish their husbands as they approached the shore after long periods working at sea.

Viewers in both Britain and Denmark, where the series originated, have become enamoured with the look, clamouring to get their hands on similar jumpers. ‘Everybody wanted that sweater,’ says Sofie. ‘The company in the Faroe Islands that makes them couldn’t keep up.’

The jumper was Sofie’s idea after producers said they wanted to avoid the cliche of the woman in a suit in a man’s world.

‘I saw the sweater and I just knew,’ she says. ‘It tells so many things about the character. It tells of a woman who has so much confidence in herself that she doesn’t have to use her sex to get what she wants. She works in a cynical world, but the sweater says that maybe deep down there’s a longing to, I don’t know, sit around a fire with a guitar.’

Unbelievably there is even an entire website devoted to the jumper.

Sarahlundsweater.com details where fans can buy both the original Gudrun & Gudrun sweater used in the show as well as cheaper alternatives, as well as information about the show and how to knit your own version of the Lund.
