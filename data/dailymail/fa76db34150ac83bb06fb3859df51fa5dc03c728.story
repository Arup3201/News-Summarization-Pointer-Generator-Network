Alexis Sanchez took time out from Chile's friendly fixtures to enjoy a barbecue with Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal.

The Arsenal star has smashed eight Premier League goals so far following his summer switch from Barcelona.

And Sanchez continued his scoring spree by setting Chile on their way to a 5-0 rout of Venezuela on Friday as goals from Jorge Valdivia, QPR forward Eduardo Vargas, Rodrigo Millar and substitute Pablo Hernandez sealed an emphatic win.

Sanchez celebrated his strike with a barbecue the following day and posted a photo alongside Juve ace Vidal, along with the message: 'With my partner @kingarturo23 sharing a great barbacue!!'

The 25-year-old will be hoping to continue his goal glut when Chile take on Uruguay in Santiago on Tuesday.

Luis Suarez will sit out the game after being given the green light to return to Barcelona.

'We all know what Luis means to us but we know we won't have him at the Copa America so it's good to look for alternatives to get used to playing without him,' said the Uruguay captain, Diego Godín.
