Backing: The family of an officer killed in the hunt have called for Sgt Sean Murphy to be reinstated

The family of a police officer slain during the Boston bombing have leapt to the defence of a colleague who faces the sack for releasing pictures of the moment suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured.

Tactical photographer Sgt Sean Murphy was so enraged by a cover of music magazine Rolling Stone depicting the suspect as a rock star that he handed images he had taken on the night Tsarnaev was apprehended to Boston Magazine.

He argued Rolling Stone had glamorised terrorism by running the picture Tsarnaev, who turned 20 yesterday, had taken of himself looking like a hippy.

Murphy argued his images showed the 
true face of terrorism, but he was reprimanded for releasing them 
without authorisation and suspended. He is due to attend a hearing with 
his bosses later this week.

He
 has now received the backing of the dead MIT police officer Sean 
Collier's family, who have slammed Rolling Stone for for 'portraying the
 face of evil', and have called for the Massachusetts State Police 
officer to be reinstated.

A
 statement, printed by Boston Magazine, read: 'We, the family of slain 
MIT police officer, Sean Collier, were fortunate to get to know Sgt Sean
 Murphy in the days following Sean’s death.

'Sgt. Murphy was a member of the 
dedicated contingent of Massachusetts State Police Officers who are 
responsible for helping families plan and organise the funerals of 
police officers killed in the line of duty.

'With
 the help of Sgt Murphy, his fellow state police, and the officers of 
the MIT Police Department, our family was able to get through those dark
 days.

Suspect: The moment Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured covered in blood and with the dot of a sniper's rifle laser on his forehead. Right, the Rolling Stone magazine cover that caused the furore

Hero: Police believe the Boston bombing suspects shot Sean Collier five times before attempting to steal his gun

Angry: Sgt Sean Murphy said he was so incensed by what he saw as the glamorisation of Tsarnaev by Rolling Stone magazine, that he released these photos

'We believe that Sgt Murphy’s motives were selfless when he released the photos, taken the night after our son and brother was murdered and the terrorist was apprehended.

'In our opinion, he has been sufficiently punished. Sgt Murphy wanted to right what he and many in Boston and around the country saw as a wrong, and to counter the aggrandisement of terrorism by Rolling Stone magazine.

Support: Murphy's actions have received a lot of support on social media platforms, with more than 66,000 people having 'liked' a 'Save Sgt. Sean Murphy' Facebook page

'Terrorists are not rock stars and they should not be rewarded with fame and magazine covers.

'The real heroes are the law enforcement officers, first responders, and victims of this terror. It is they who should be honoured.

'Images are very powerful and they have the ability to shape our thoughts and actions.

'The images from the night that we lost Sean are now burned in our memories. No amount of fluffing and buffing will make them softer.

'We are sure that all the other marathon victims have similar images. It’s too bad Rolling Stone only wanted to portray the face of evil.

'The ongoing support of the family of police officers who we have come to know these past three terrible months, including Sgt Murphy, is something we will never be able to repay.'

Support: A Facebook page set up to back Sgt Murphy has now received 21,392 likes

The images, which Murphy took, show the alleged bomber bruised and bloodied with his hands in the air as he emerges from his final hiding place.

It is thought Tsarnaev had shot Collier five times before attempting to steal his gun.

At
 the time, Murphy said: 'I hope that the people who see these images 
will know that this was real. It was as real as it gets,' wrote Murphy 
in a posting on the magazine’s website.

'This may have played out as a television show, but this was not a television show.'

Murphy
 has been labeled a 'hero' for his actions by many with popular option -
 especially in Boston - that he did the right thing to counteract the cover of the current issue of Rolling Stone.

Murphy's
 actions have received a lot of support on social media platforms, more 
than 10,000 people have 'liked' a 'Save Sgt. Sean Murphy' Facebook page and supporters have also taken to Twitter to call him a hero.

Federal prosecutors however were quick to voice their displeasure at Murphy’s actions.

'The release of these photos was completely unacceptable,'
 said a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen M Ortiz, whose prosecutors
 are preparing a case against Tsarnaev on 30 federal charges, 17 of them
 capital offenses.

'We 
have spoken with the Massachusetts State Police, who have assured us 
that the release of the photos was unauthorized and that they are taking
 action internally in response.'

It
 is unclear whether the photos could damage the federal case against the
 man accused of setting off pressure cooker bombs that killed three 
people and injured more than 260.

Murphy accompanied the Swat teams as 
they descended on a boat in the backyard of a Watertown home, where 
Tsarnaev sought refuge following one of the biggest manhunts in U.S. 
history.

Murphy, who has worked in law enforcement for 25 years, has been ordered by his bosses to refrain from speaking to the media.

The Rolling Stone cover story on Tsarnaev was released online last week, a few days after Tsarnaev's court appearance.

Critics
 blasted the magazine, saying the cover shot of Tsarnaev was reminiscent
 of the magazine's flattering portrayals or rock legends such as Jim 
Morrison.

Rolling 
Stone claimed the story was part of its commitment to 'serious and 
thoughtful coverage' of important political and cultural issues, but 
several stores - including Walgreens and CVS - have refused to stock it.
