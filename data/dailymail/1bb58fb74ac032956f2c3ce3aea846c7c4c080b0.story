Sony's top corporate executive has broken his silence on the recent hacking assault against Sony's film division, saying his employees have been the victims of a 'vicious and malicious cyber-attack'.

CEO Kazuo Hirai opened a press event at the International CES trade show on Monday by acknowledging he 'would be remiss' if he didn't mention the controversy over the Sony comedy, 'The Interview.'

Hackers calling themselves the 'Guardians of Peace' managed to cripple the computer systems of Sony Pictures Entertainment in late November, before subsequently releasing a trove of sensitive corporate and employee records.

Speaking out: Kazuo Hirai slammed the attack as vicious and vowed to champion freedom of expression

The FBI has since blamed the North Korean government of orchestrating the attack, apparently in ire over the film's portrayal of an attempt to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Hirai said he is proud of his employees for standing against 'the extortionist efforts of criminals.' 

Sony initially said the film would not be released to major theaters in the face of threats by the hackers.

However, after the company was criticized for that decision, it scrambled to release the film to independent theaters and online.

Hirai did not offer any new information about the hack, but he said that freedom of speech and expression are 'very important' to Sony and its entertainment business.

He went on to thank the telecommunications and Internet companies who helped with the release, and 'most importantly the people who have gone out to see the movie in theaters or through various online venues.'

He also joked about another Sony film release, saying: 'By the way, Annie is also a great movie as well.' 

Sony executives spent most of the CES event talking about new televisions, high-resolution cameras and other electronic gadgets that the company is introducing this year.
