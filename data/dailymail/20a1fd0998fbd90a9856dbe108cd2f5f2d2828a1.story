They were the Posh and Becks of their day - a couple that caused admiration, intrigue and, at times, controversy, wherever they went in the Seventies.

Now decades later, a rare insight into the romance of Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg has been revealed with the release of candid family photos that were taken by her brother, Andrew.

The couple met on a film set in 1968 after the British actress had separated from her husband, the composer John Barry, and songwriter Serge had just broken up with Brigitte Bardot.

Famous romance: Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg were together for 12 years

Jane's brother Andrew took candid shots of the couple at home and abroad: These pictures were taken in Jane's house in Cheyne Row, London, in 1978

They become inseparable and had a passionate 12 year romance in which they had a daughter, Charlotte, who is now an actress.

Their union was not without controversy after they wrote and produced the song 'Je t'aime... moi non plus' which contained explicit lyrics and orgasmic moans. The song was banned by numerous radio stations including the BBC and the Vatican declared it was 'offensive'.

What larks we had: Andrew said Serge's 'sardonic wit' shines through the pictures

During their relationship, Jane's brother was a constant presence in their lives. As an avid photographer, he took pictures of the family as they travelled the world or relaxed at home with what he described as  'clandestine 
intimacy'.

'All pretty corny stuff, 
  but what larks we had, spiced as always by Serge's sardonic wit and sense of 
  fun,' Andrew he told the Telegraph of their times together.

Love of her life: Even though they separated, Jane and Serge remained friends until his death in 1991

His pictures, some in black and white, others in colour show a couple in love and happy home life.

Yet they separated in 1980. Andrew explains why: 'After 10 years together, Jane still loved him, but her patience with 
his alcoholic bouts was beginning to wear thin, especially when he 
became aggressive. The following year they separated. For Jane it was a 
new beginning.'

But Jane, who remains a force in fashion thanks to the Birkin bag that was created for her by Hermés, still remained friends with Serge until his death in 1991 at the age of 62 from a heart attack.

Andrew said: 'Serge was the love of Jane’s life, and when 
he died, in 1991, her grief was agonising to behold, made even more 
painful by the death of our father two days later.'
