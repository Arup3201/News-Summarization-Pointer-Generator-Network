CNN was attacked last night for broadcasting a picture of Baroness Thatcher with paedophile Jimmy Savile in its coverage of the former prime minister’s death.

The U.S. broadcaster used an image from February 1980 of the disgraced BBC DJ presenting her with a cheque for £10,000 in aid of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.

Global TV networks broadcasted tributes yesterday to Lady Thatcher, who died aged 87 following a stroke in bed at the Ritz Hotel in central London, where she had been staying since after Christmas.

Report blunder: CNN used a 1980 image of paedophile Jimmy Savile presenting Baroness Thatcher with a cheque for £10,000 in aid of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children

But the unfortunate image was captured by Neal Mann, New York-based social media editor of the Wall Street Journal, and posted on his Twitter feed - before it was retweeted more than 4,000 times.

He said at 1:20pm UK time, shortly after Baroness Thatcher's death was announced at 12:48pm: 'Oh dear someone at CNN obviously didn't get the memo - runs obit pic of Thatcher with Jimmy Savile.'

Donal Blaney, CEO of campaign group Conservative Way Forward, said on Twitter: 'Next time you are told Fox News is biased, just remember what tawdry CNN did to Margaret Thatcher yesterday.'

Other Twitter users described the image's use on CNN Starting Point as 'ridiculous' and 'not ideal'. A CNN spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment on the matter from MailOnline.

Last December a letter thought to mark the beginning of the warm relationship between Lady Thatcher and Savile was made public, but other correspondence between the pair was censored.

The Top Of The Pops presenter sent an adoring letter to the then prime minister in 1980, singing her praises and declaring his love for her. She responded by inviting the now-disgraced DJ to lunch at Chequers, spending 11 consecutive New Year’s Eves with him and overseeing his knighthood.

The letter, part of a Savile file released under the 30-year rule by the National Archives at Kew, revealed how well connected to the establishment he was.

More than 450 people have made allegations of abuse by the DJ, who died in October 2011 aged 84.
