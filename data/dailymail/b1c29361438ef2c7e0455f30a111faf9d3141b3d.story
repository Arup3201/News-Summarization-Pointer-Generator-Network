Trial: A Togolese man went on trial charged with raping and assaulting three adolescents in voodoo exorcism sessions (file photo)

The uncle and mother of three teenage girls have been sentenced to 14 years in jail for raping and assaulting them in voodoo exorcism sessions.

The man, a 28-year-old from Togo, claimed to have been 'chasing out an evil spirit' when he assaulted his niece and her two older sisters between 2010 and 2011.

The victims' mother, 41, was found guilty of complicity as she had even supplied the condoms used in the crime.

'She more or less delivered her daughter to the rapist,' the prosecutor told a court in Bobigny, an eastern suburb of Paris.

During the sessions, the man would wash the girls' genital areas, and cut their hands and legs before applying a purportedly magical black powder to the wounds.

His sister-in-law was found to have given her consent.

The man was arrested in February 2011 after his last rape.

He claims that he is unaware of the rapes inflicted on his niece.

The victim's lawyer, Daniel Merchat, said: 'This denial is the second rape. It is a rape of the soul.'

The prosecutor also said: 'The voodoo belief that was cited is just window dressing,' adding that the man 'does not suffer from any mental illness... he is completely responsible for his acts.'

The uncle, whose identity is not known, was sentenced to 14 years; the mother was handed a seven-year jail term.

It is the latest in a number of voodoo cases which have emerged in France, which has a large African community, in the past few years.

Recently four men were sentenced for holding a young woman captive and torturing her as they believed she was possessed.

Earlier this year Spanish police 
broken up a ring that smuggled in women from Nigeria and forced them 
into street prostitution by burning them with irons and using voodoo 
rituals.

The gang tortured the women and scared them with curses to force them on to the streets.

Six people, including one woman believed to be a ringleader-Â  were arrested after one of the women alerted authorities.

Last year, a Nigerian people smuggler who used witchcraft rituals to force children to work as sex slaves was jailed for 20 years in Britain.

Osezua Osolase, 42, tricked poverty-stricken Nigerian orphans into travelling to the UK with the promise of a better life.

But the young victims were raped, sexually abused and subjected to voodoo-style rituals by a child trafficking ring.

Osolase, the linchpin of a multi-million pound global sex trafficking ring, used 'juju' magic to control his victims.

He told the teenage girls they would die or never bear children if they tried to escape or revealed what had happened to them.
