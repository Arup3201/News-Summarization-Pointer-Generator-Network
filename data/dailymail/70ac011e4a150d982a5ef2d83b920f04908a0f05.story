A blood test that screens couples for thousands of genetic flaws which they could pass on to a baby is to go on sale.

Couples will be told if the combination of their genes puts them at risk of having a child with an incurable disease. The compatibility test can flag up more than 600 conditions, including some that kill within the first years of life.

If couples are told they are at risk of having a child whose life would be blighted by ill-health, they can decide whether to adopt, have IVF treatment or go ahead and get pregnant naturally.

New test: Couples will be told if the combination of their genes puts them at risk of having a child with an incurable disease

Spanish firm iGenomix, which developed the test, says pre-pregnancy genetic screening could soon become as commonplace as ultrasound scans.

The company’s test is designed to give peace of mind, but at £1,800 per couple – £900 per person – it doesn’t come cheap. Plus, there are concerns people will become stigmatised simply because they are carrying the ‘wrong genes’. Critics also say it panders to those who believe the only acceptable child is a perfect one.

The NHS does pre-pregnancy testing but focuses on people with a family history of just a few conditions. The new test, which will be available at Randox Health clinics in London and Northern Ireland from May, checks for thousands of faulty pieces of DNA.

Conditions include cystic fibrosis, which is carried by one in 25 Britons, as well as rarer conditions that cause blindness, blood disorders and life-threatening hormonal problems. Conditions such as autism, Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes are not included.

The test is aimed at people who are carriers of disease genes, meaning they will not have symptoms themselves and may even be unaware of the problem lurking in their DNA.

Most people have several disease genes and a recent study by iGenomix found that 8 per cent of couples were ‘clinically incompatible’, meaning both had the same faulty DNA. Such couples would be told there was a one in four chance of their child being ill and counselled on their options.

These include an IVF technique, in which only healthy embryos are implanted in the womb, the use of donor eggs or sperm or adoption. Some women may opt to get pregnant naturally and abort later.

Dr Peter FitzGerald, managing director of Randox Health, said: ‘Our wide-ranging new screen will detect potential problems before pregnancy by obtaining information from both parents. With this test, we can alert prospective parents to the risk of serious genetic conditions.’

There is another pre-pregnancy test available privately but it checks for only 100 diseases.

Philippa Taylor, of the Christian Medical Fellowship, said the limited and expensive options available to couples who ‘fail’ the test could push them toward getting pregnant naturally – and aborting if the baby is unhealthy. She added: ‘This test is going to create further anxiety through the over-medicalisation of pregnancy.’

Dr David King, of campaign group Human Genetics Alert, warned that if testing became popular, couples could feel pressurised to use it to avoid having children with genetic conditions.

He added: ‘That will lead to a society in which parents with disabled children will be blamed and disability will become less and less acceptable. We need regulation and ethical debate before such tests are introduced.’
