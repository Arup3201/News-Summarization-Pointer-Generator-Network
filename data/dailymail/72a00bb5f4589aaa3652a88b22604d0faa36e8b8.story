Paul Lambert has warned Aston Villa against another FA Cup upset as he aims to avoid more embarrassment against lower-league opposition.

Villa host Sky Bet Championship strugglers Blackpool in the third round on Sunday.

The visitors are bottom of the Championship, but Villa can take nothing for granted having lost to Sky Bet League One side Leyton Orient in the Capital One Cup this season, as well as being dumped out of the FA Cup by Sheffield United last term. Villa have won just twice in their last 16 Barclays Premier League games and just twice at home this season.

Lambert said: 'We have to be wary, they have nothing to lose. They will come out and give it a go and they won't sit in. It's a cup game and will be a breather from the league where they are having a difficult time. It's a tough game. You would think they would come and give it a game.

'I've spoken to Lee (Clark, Blackpool boss) a few times and know Alan Thompson who was a good friend at Celtic. We have to make sure we get through it.'

Villa are the lowest scorers in the top four divisions with just 11 goals in 20 league matches while Blackpool have netted just 18 times.

Villa were jeered off after their stalemate with Cyrstal Palace on New Year's Day, a second straight home 0-0 draw, but Lambert insisted the goals will come for the team and striker Christian Benteke.

'Christian needs to keep going, in the last four or five games he has always had a chance and it will come,' he said. 'If he keeps persevering it will come.

'We're playing out through the back and just need to take the chance. If we won 1-0 everyone would have thought Thursday would have been the perfect game. The stats show we are creating more and we just have to finish it off.

'We've only lost two games in 10 and our defensive record is really strong. There's loads of things which are progressing but when they get the chance we have to take it.'

Lambert is set to make changes against the Tangerines with young midfielder Jack Grealish expected to start.

'There's a chance Jack could start Sunday,' Lambert said. 'Thursday was a bit more difficult for him than what it was against Sunderland. It was a different type of game, so we'll see.'
