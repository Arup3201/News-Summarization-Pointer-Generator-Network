After putting up with ten years of building work by her next-door neighbour, Annie Reed Henderson is at her wits’ end.

She says she is so fed up with the failure of her local council to stop the constant noise, mess and disruption outside her £1million house that she plans to stop paying her council tax.

And the pensioner is even prepared to go to prison to try to end her nightmare. She fears it could go on for another decade unless action is taken.

Mrs Reed Henderson, 67, says the back garden of neighbour John Donaghy’s property has been a permanent builders’ yard since 2002.

Among the bizarre renovations carried out by developer John Donaghy are an underground cinema and an enormous brick outhouse

All but the facade of the four-bedroom Victorian terrace property has been slowly dismantled and gradually rebuilt.

The work has included building an outhouse, sinking a borehole in the back garden, digging out an extension to the basement and putting up new garden walls. It is understood builders have also ripped out the original Victorian features.

Mrs Reed Henderson, who works as a psychotherapist, says her complaints to her local council have been ignored. She said: ‘The noise disrupts my therapy sessions. I was assured this work would end years ago and yet it’s still going on.

‘I believe the developers have no intention of finishing this any time soon. It could take them another ten years. I’m at my wits' end. I feel I’ve been let down by the council.

Mrs Reed Henderson says her complaints to Wandsworth council have been ignored and is so distraught she has vowed to stop paying her council tax and be taken to court

Work has included building three outhouses, sinking a borehole in the back garden, digging out an extension to the basement and erecting new garden walls

‘If this is still going on in July, I will stop paying my council tax. I’m prepared to go to court and even prison if that’s what it takes.’

Mrs Reed Henderson, who has also worked as a model and advertising executive, has spent £30,000 on solicitors’ and surveyors’ fees to try to bring an end to the development.

But after making multiple complaints to the council about the property, she has been informed that officials have no power to force a developer to finish a job and that work could go on indefinitely.

Every day, a team of up to nine workmen toil at the house. Builders’ vans frequently block the tree-lined suburban street 200 yards from Clapham Common in south London.

Mrs Reed Henderson suspects the site is being used as a workshop for other business projects.

Other neighbours complain that the house has become an eyesore and that skips filled with rubbish are left outside it for weeks at a time.

Mrs Reed Henderson moved into her home with her then husband Mark nearly 40 years ago and they raised two children before divorcing ten years ago.

Developer Mr Donaghy, 54, who lives nearby with wife Julie and their two children, blamed complicated council planning rules and expensive fees for the length of time the renovations had taken.

It is understood builders have also ripped out the original Victorian features and constructed an external wardrobe onto the outside wall

He added that his wife’s advanced breast cancer has prevented him from spending more time finishing the property.

‘My neighbour’s claims are not valid,’ said Mr Donaghy. ‘If they were valid, the council would have done something about them.’

A Wandsworth Council spokesman said: ‘We have a great degree of sympathy for the neighbours, but planning laws do not impose time limits for works to be completed so there are no legal powers that can be used to compel him to do the job quicker.

‘We are also aware that some neighbours are unhappy with materials being stored in his back garden, but as they are required for these works, if we were to ask the owner to move them the whole thing would undoubtedly take even longer to finish.’
