Her fur may be a little matted and her whiskers somewhat scruffy, but when you’re 115 you can be forgiven for letting yourself go just a bit.

After turning 24 earlier this year – and hitting 115 in cat years this month – Olive is now laying claim to the title of the world’s oldest cat.

But she has a potential catfight on her paws from other felines lining up to claim the distinction.

John Burgess, 74, from Partington, Greater Manchester,  said Olive the cat was born in March 1990

The previous record holder, Poppy from Bournmouth, who was born a month earlier, died in June

Now Mr Burgess has to get Olive recognised officially by Guinness World Records before it becomes official

Olive’s owner John Burgess, 74, says she was born in March 1990 – one month after the previous record holder, Poppy, from Bournemouth, Dorset, who died in June.

Mr Burgess, from Partington, Greater Manchester, adopted Olive from a neighbour as a kitten – and it seems she is just as playful today as she was then.

‘Olive has got brilliant, bright eyes and her claws are sharp as anything,’ he said. ‘She still catches birds, frogs and hedgehogs. She’s kept her hearing and sight.’

Olive now needs to be recognised by Guinness World Records to be named the world’s oldest living cat, meaning Mr Burgess would have to provide documentation to support his claim. 

Yesterday David and Joyce Willey, of Sidmouth, Devon, came forward with Putts, a female tortoiseshell, who they say was born in January 1989 – making her 14 months older than Olive. However, the couple admitted they have no record to prove her age.

Olive the cat is 24, or 115 in cat years - which is worked out along the lines of a complicated formula 

In July, Pinky the tabby, from Dunston in Lincolnshire, emerged as a contender aged 28, or 129 cat years.

Owners Ann and Bob Higginbottom said they had proof she was born in July 1986 but hadn’t yet got in touch with Guinness World Records with Pinky’s certificates.

All the cats have a few years to go if they are to catch up with Creme Puff from Austin, Texas, who lived for an astonishing 38 years and three days before her death in August 2005.

The formula for calculating cat years equates the first two years of life to 25 human years. Then each additional year counts as four cat years.
