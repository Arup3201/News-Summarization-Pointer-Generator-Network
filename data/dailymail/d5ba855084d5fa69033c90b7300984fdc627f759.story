Most fugitives don't have time to update their social media accounts.

But Annabell Dundon, 24, who is wanted on a European Arrest Warrant after allegedly threatening to kill her brother's ex-girlfriend, has recently posted a series of provocative pictures on Facebook while on the run.

Known as Bella, she comes from the notorious Dundon crime family, known for drug dealing, armed robbery and extortion, and is the younger sister of Wayne, John and Dessie Dundon - who are all in jail.

The Dundon brothers attempted to organise the purchase of assault rifles and rocket launchers to escalate the gang feuds in their home town of Limerick. 

The thugs followed in the footsteps of their father Kenneth who was first convicted for assault in 1974.

He went on to serve a six-year sentence in London for stabbing Christopher Jacobs, 50, to death. 

But Ms Dundon's other brother Ger, 26, who was released from prison last year, is now thought to be living in London - and she is believed to be there too.

Ms Dundon, who allegedly threatened to kill her brother's ex-girlfriend, posted this picture in September

Another picture shows Ma Dundon, from Limerick in Ireland, posing in a tight black dress in a bathroom 

She is wanted on suspicion of threatening to kill April Collins, Ger's former girlfriend.

In one photo posted a week ago, she poses with a hand in her hair wearing a jewelled white bra and miniskirt with high heels - showing off her legs and a tattoo on her stomach.

In another, she is pictured pouting in a short black and white dress posing with a leg lifted up on a chair. 

And in another, she poses looking into a bathroom mirror wearing a tight black dress with sparkly studs. 

Ms Dundon was charged with threatening Miss Collins at Limerick District Court and granted bail with strict conditions.  

The conditions stated she must stay at her home address in Limerick and visit the Roxboro Garda station every day.  

But in May last year, she failed to appear for her trial at Limerick Circuit Criminal Court.  

Ms Dundon's Facebook cover photo is a pair of gun-shaped high heeled shows decorated with bullets
