Edward Snowden's girlfriend Lindsay Mills joined director Laura Poitras on stage after Citizenfour won the Academy Award for best documentary feature on Sunday night. 

Snowden, a National Security Agency contractor who leaked classified US government documents, congratulated director Poitras for the win later that night. 

Snowden said that, although he had at first been 'extremely reluctant', he was grateful Poitras had persuaded him to be a part of the film.

Mills once described Edward Snowden as her 'man of mystery'

During her acceptance speech, Poitras thanked Snowden 'for his courage' and said she shared the award with 'other journalists who are exposing the truth'

Mills also joined the Citizenfour team at the Independent Spirit Awards, where they won best documentary 

'The result is a brave and brilliant film that deserves the honor and recognition it has received,' he wrote in a statement released through the American Civil Liberties Union. 

'My hope is that this award will encourage more people to see the film and be inspired by its message that ordinary citizens, working together, can change the world.' 

During her acceptance speech, Poitras thanked Snowden 'for his courage' and said she shared the award with 'other journalists who are exposing the truth'. 

She added that Snowden's disclosures in the film reveal threats not only to democracy, 'but to our lives ourselves'. 

Mills, a pole dancer who lived with Snowden, 31, before he fled the United States, moved to Moscow, Russia, after he received asylum there last year 

Silent treatment: Mills has never spoken publicly about the Snowden scandal

Snowden congratulated director Laura Poitras after her film Citizenfour won the Academy Award for best documentary feature on Sunday night 

'The more important decisions being made affecting all of us are made in secret,' she said on the Oscar stage. 'We lose our ability to check the powers that control.' 

Poitras also shared the stage with journalist Glenn Greenwald, who was a collaborator on the film.

After Poitras left the stage, ceremony host Neil Patrick Harris joked: 'Edward couldn't be here for some treason.'

Snowden is currently in Russia, where he was granted asylum. 

US officials have promised to prosecute him if they are ever able to take him into custody.  

Citizenfour beat Finding Vivian Maier, Last Days In Vietnam, The Salt Of The Earth and Virunga. 

It is Poitras' first Oscar win. She was previously nominated for her film, 'My Country, My Country'

Because of the sensitive nature of the footage, Poitras made Citizenfour under intense secrecy and edited it in Germany.

The film shows glimpses of the former NSA contractor's paranoia. When room service calls his room, Snowden unplugs his phone and he ducks under a blanket to enter passwords on his laptop.

Yet Snowden says in the film, and has repeated his sentiment since, that he was willing to be the target of criticism and derision and branded a traitor.

'If you're not willing to be called some bad names to serve your country, you really don't care that much about your country,' Snowden said at a forum earlier this month. 'So bring the names on.' 

One scene in the film shows Snowden cooking with Mills in their wood-paneled Moscow apartment, which is decorated with plants. 

Snowden said that, although he had at first been 'extremely reluctant', he was grateful Poitras (pictured with Mathilde Bonnefoy and Dirk Wilutzky) had persuaded him to be a part of the film

Last year Snowden admitted in a webcam interview at the New Yorker Festival that he misses America - a place he may never return to, Politico reported.

'The question is what don't I miss, whether it's my family, whether it's my home, whether it's my friends, whether it's my work at the agency, I was fulfilled and happy,' he said.

'Things as simple as having my old beat-up car, there's a lot to miss. It's a great country.' 

On her blog in 2013, after Snowden fled to Hong Kong following the leak, Mills dotingly called him her ‘man of mystery’ who she had followed around the world for the last four years.

Mills wrote: 'My world has opened and closed all at once. Leaving me lost at sea without a compass.

'As I type this on my tear-streaked keyboard I’m reflecting on all the faces that have graced my path.

'The ones I laughed with. The ones I’ve held. The one I’ve grown to love the most. And the ones I never got to bid adieu.

‘But sometimes life doesn’t afford proper goodbyes.'
