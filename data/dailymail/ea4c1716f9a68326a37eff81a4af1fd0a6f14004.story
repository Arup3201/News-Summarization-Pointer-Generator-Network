British women about to turn 34 are due for a pleasant birthday surprise: it is the age is when they're supposed to feel happiest with their naked bodies, according to a new survey.

According to the new research, 34-year-old women finally learn to accept their lumps and bumps - which is good news for Kelly Brook, Caroline Flack, Donna Air and Kate Hudson who are all 34, or due to celebrate their 34th birthdays, this year.

The research challenges the notion that Brits are a prudish nation, with 40 per cent of women - the equivalent of 8 million of them - looking at themselves naked in the mirror every day.

A further 25 per cent sneak a peek at least once a week and just 16 per cent of British women never look at themselves in the mirror when they're nude.

Beautician Nichola Joss says the findings make sense: 'Those in their early to mid-thirties typically have great body confidence.

They work hard to maintain the best body shape possible, are educated about eating well and treating their body with respect.

'Many 34 year olds I know have experienced either a loving relationship or close personal friendship and these bring confidence, both inside and out.'

When asked their favourite body parts, 30 per cent of those polled revealed they are proud of their breasts, saying they are the body part they most like to flaunt.

This is closely followed by legs (22 per cent) and shoulders (19 per cent).

When asked what part of their body they would most like to change, the majority (57 per cent) said their stomachs.

Yet as we hit peak beach season, British women are in a quandary about what to wear while sun-bathing.

Social media is influencing women’s decision-making processes; 65 per cent won’t wear a bikini on holiday for fear of embarrassing photos appearing on Facebook.

When it comes to Brits’ bikini idols, Elle McPherson, 49, secured the most votes (50 per cent) in the best body category.

Kylie Minogue topped the poll for best bottom (43 per cent), closely followed by Jennifer Lopez (32 per cent) and Carol Vorderman (8 per cent).

When it comes to killer curves, British is definitely best, with women citing Holly Willoughby (48 per cent), Catherine Zeta Jones (22 per cent) and Nigella Lawson (17 per cent) as the curvy bodies they most envy.  

Topping the poll for best arms was yoga devotee Jennifer Aniston (47 per cent) followed by former ballerina and Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell (25 per cent).

Darcey’s ballerina-sculpted legs are also envied by 16 per cent of British women, second only to Cameron Diaz whose athletic legs are coveted by 35 per cent of Brits.

Darcey Bussell, ambassador for Sanctuary Spa Active Reverse Body, who carried out the survey, said: 'For me, body confidence is all about being healthy, strong and happy in my own skin.

'I also think that good posture improves confidence and can take years off your appearance. Always pull out of your waist to create space between your hips and ribs, this improves core strength and helps you to look and feel more confident in your own skin.'
