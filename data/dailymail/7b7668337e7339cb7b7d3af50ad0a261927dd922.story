He was one of the most respected poets of the Second World War and a military hero, but he was also a serial deserter who lied about his war record.

Vernon Scannell saw violence on the battlefield, but he took it back home, savagely beating the women in his life, according to revelations in a new biography. 

As a Desert Rat, who was seriously wounded in Normandy, and wrote of the 'heroic corpses' that he saw for himself on the D-Day beaches, he was no coward.

Revelations: A new biography has revealed that wartime poet Vernon Scannell, pictured left as an old man and right as a soldier, was a serial deserter who lied about his war record

But the horrors of war took their toll on him. Now, seven years after his death aged 85, new research reveals that he absconded more than a dozen times, got into drunken brawls and physically abused his wife and two partners – apparently unaware of what he had done even on seeing the bruises he had inflicted on them. 

His desertions were known, but the full extent of them and the details have now been discovered by James Andrew Taylor, whose research will be published by Oxford University Press on October 24 in Walking Wounded: The Life And Poetry Of Vernon Scannell.

The biography tells the story of a prize-winning and much-anthologised poet whose writings were 'drenched in humanity', as Professor John Carey puts it in the biography’s foreword.

Scannell was tormented by wartime memories of a soldier’s dying screams. In 1962, he wrote one of the most moving of war poems, Walking Wounded: '…the walking wounded/Straggling the road like convicts loosely chained/Dragging at ankles exhaustion and despair/…'

Nor could he forget the shock of seeing fellow soldiers looting corpses, both British and German, stealing their watches and other valuables. 

Now Taylor has unearthed unpublished material from army records and other sources, and persuaded Scannell’s family to speak for the first time.

Each of them told him of a tortured individual that they adored, somehow forgiving him for lashing out at them. Angela Beese, a long-term girlfriend, showed Taylor a diary entry in which she had cowered in fear: 'I think he might kill me, he is so angry.' But the next day, she wrote: 'I can see love once more in his eyes.'

She also revealed the horror of being punched in the face by him - Scannell had learnt to punch as a boxer - but the next morning, he saw her two black eyes and a broken nose, but did not comment.

His daughter, Nancy, says in the biography that her father never laid a finger on his children: 'But we were terrified for my mother. He was an aggressive drunk, destructive.'

Taylor says that the descriptions of the violence against the women in his life are 'horrible'.

Yet, the women saw another side to Scannell. Beese also told the biographer: 'Poetry was Vernon’s religion… Nothing, no human, mattered to him as much. Poetry was his wife, his mistress, his mother, his father.'

Another former girlfriend, Jo Peters, recalls waking him from nightmares, sweating and shouting.

'He remembered the first dead body he had seen… covered with a blanket, and all he could see was the hand,' she says.

Taylor presented the evidence and symptoms to a leading psychiatrist who believes that Scannell would today be diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

He said: 'Scannell, without doubt, was seriously damaged by the war - the jealous rages, the drunkenness, the violence, and the nightmares are all common enough symptoms of PTSD that is the forgotten legacy of combat for many thousands of old soldiers. It was the women he loved who suffered the bruises, the blood, and the tears - but it would be a harsh judge who ruled that Scannell himself was not a victim as well. The scars of war cut deep.'

Scannell wrote several moving poems about  El Alamein, including one conveying the heroism of a Scottish piper at the height of the battle: 'Of course that brave young piper/Did not stand there long/Shrapnel or a Spandau-burst/Ended that brief song.'

'But he wasn’t there', Taylor says, having discovered that Scannell got to North Africa after El Alamein.

Scannell wrote several moving poems about El Alamein, including one conveying the heroism of a Scottish piper at the height of a battle - despite the fact that Scannell had not arrived in North Africa until after El Alamein

Taylor discovered that Scannell spent more than 300 days on the run or in prison during four years of active war service from 1941. 

He found a record of a disciplinary hearing for having gone absent without leave - a hearing before Scannell’s commanding officer on 23 September, about a month after he would have had to set sail to reach North Africa in time for the battle of El Alamein. It proves that Scannell cannot possibly have been in Africa until four months later. 

Scannell did, however, take part in the bitter 1943 assault on Wadi Akarit. It was in the aftermath of that battle that he saw soldiers looting corpses. He walked away, only to be sentenced to three years’ military detention in a brutal military prison.

He was released after six months when he volunteered to take part in the D-Day landings. When Germany surrendered, he disappeared again, living as a fugitive until finally rearrested in 1947.

Scannell’s daughter, Jane, has yet to read the biography. But she says: 'As children, we were aware of the contradictions in our father - a warm, humorous, charismatic man who was a gentle, loving and fun father - and yet one whose behaviour towards our mother could be violent.

'Although we were only partially aware of his war-time experiences, even as children we felt the profound effect they had had on him.

'Neither his violence or the war were discussed in our home… However… the violence was only one very small aspect of Dad and one that did not define him to us - either as children or now.

'We hope Andrew's book will help explain what made him the man and poet he was.'
