Third-grade teacher Jennifer Doan lost seven students in her class the day an EF5 tornado ripped through Moore, Oklahoma last May, completely destroying the storm shelter-less Plaza Heights Elementary School.

The 31-year-old was eight months pregnant when she was pulled from the rubble of the destroyed school, and at the time she figured the trauma would cause her to lose her child.

But on December 21, Doan and her husband Nyle Rodgers welcomed a new son into the world and chose to name him after one of her students that didn't survive.

When the tornado got closer, Doan grabbed as many of her students as possible to huddle together. 

While the other students continued to squirm and talk, 9-year-old Nicholas McCabe became exceptionally still when Doan put her hand on him.

'He was the one closest to me that didn't make it,' she told NewsOK. I had my hand on him. He's been a little hard to let go.'

Nicolas was one of seven children who died after being crushed by a water line.

Doan and her husband chose to memorialize Nicolas by giving their new son jack the middle name of Nicolas.

Nicolas's mother Stacey McCabe was touched by the namesake for her son who loved going to the lake, playing with legos and listening to country music.

For Doan, she remembers Nicolas' smile the most.

New hope: Doan and her husband welcomed baby Jack late last month. She has two other daughters, 6 and 3

'He would get in trouble over some little thing and just flash me this big smile to get out of it. He just had one of those smiles,' she said.

After the tornado, Doan spent time in the hospital recovering from a broken back and sternum, strained neck, and lacerated tendons in her hand.

A psychologist recommended that she not be told which of her students had died for two days, and when she was finally informed her shrieks could be heard down the hallway.

She took no pain medication for her injuries since she didn't want to hurt her baby, and wore a back brace for six weeks while pregnant. 

And she's still recovering from the 
emotional injuries. Doan says she sees a psychologist once a week, and 
is having a hard time dealing with her survivor's guilt, constantly 
asking why she lived when innocent children died.

While baby Jack gives her new hope and a reason to go on, he's also a reminder of the trauma of that deadly day.

'Just looking at him, it reminds me of that day, and the ones that I did lose.'

But she does want to return to teaching at Plaza Towers, which is currently being rebuilt with storm shelters.

'There's a lot of me in Plaza Towers. I know it's going to be difficult. I'm hoping it will bring some peace and some healing.

Doan is also mother to two daughters, Kairi, 6, and Kylie, 3.
