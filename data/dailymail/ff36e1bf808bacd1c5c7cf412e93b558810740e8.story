Joseph Messina (pictured) was given 30 month probation for attack on Eric Bartels that left him paralyzed

A man who left a father paralyzed and blind after attacking him outside a bar walked free from court, yesterday.

Father-of-one Eric Bartels is now unable to speak after the 'unprovoked' attack by Joseph Messina, 25, in Mokena, Illinois, in 2009.

Despite his severe injuries, Messina escaped an immediate jail sentence and was given just 30 months of probation and ordered to undertake 250 hours of community service, by Will County Judge Sarah Jones.

State attorney James Glasgow said he believed there was enough evidence to justify a prison sentence.

He told theÂ Chicago Tribune: 'The injuries to Eric Bartels are a hair's breadth from murder.

'This isn't a broken nose. The seriousness of the offense can be taken into account in determining the appropriate punishment.'

Judge Jones told the court that her decision was based on the law and not emotion.

Messina served 59 days in the county jail.

During Messina's trial at the beginning of the year, it was said that Messina threw the first punch after Bartels allegedly make a remark about a bloodstain on his shirt.

Prosecutor said Messina punched Bartels to the ground and then hit him once more.

It was said in court that Messina then held his hands in the air while straddling Bartels, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Messina was found guilty of aggravated battery in January.

Judge Jones ordered Messina to pay $630 a month during the probation period to Jan Bartels, the victim's mother, to help pay for medical costs.

The $20,000 bond put up by Messina's family will also be paid to the victim.

According to the Chicago Tribune, Messina faces 180-days in county jail if he drinks alcohol while on probation.
