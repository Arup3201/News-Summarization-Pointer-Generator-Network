A lorry driver who tipped the scales at 18.5 stone went on an extreme health-kick after he was told he was too fat to keep his driving licence.

Bob Baker, 52, from Tilbury, Essex, drove for 12 hours a day and said the most exercise he got was popping into the local pub.

On the road he would tuck into a fry-up so large that it covered two dinner plates and snacked on crisps and chocolate in his cab.

In the evening, he tucked into takeaways and admits he could easily finish a case of lager.

Mr Baker weighed 18.5st before the threat of losing his HGV licence motivated him to get fit

The father-of-two used to eat huge fry-ups for breakfast and snack on crisps and chocolate

'I used to drive in Europe and would bring lack lots of cheap alcohol back home,' he told MailOnline.

'I would sometimes drink from one of those wine glasses that could take a whole bottle of wine.'

But in February 2006, he faced losing his livelihood after he failed a compulsory medical examination at the age of 45 required to renew his HGV licence.

'The doctor told me I needed to bring my blood pressure down by September or I would lose my licence, but I didn't just want to pop pills,' he said.

'As soon as I was faced with not being able to pay the mortgage, everything changed for me.'

The determined trucker, who had just started a new job as a driver for Tesco, started cycling to and from the depot every day - a round trip of 18 miles. He had to borrow his then 20-year-old son's bike as he didn't have one of his own.

'It was a simple decision, though it felt like it nearly killed me,' he said.

'The first day I cycled I had to get up at 3.30am to get in for a 5.30am shift as it took me an hour to cycle nine miles.

'Then I did a 12 and a half hour shift and cycling back it poured with rain.

'I remember lying in bed aching from my eyebrows to my ankles. But I wouldn't be beaten.'

Before and after: The lorry driver lost five stone in just nine months and shrunk his waistline by 10inches

The father-of-two also overhauled his diet. He ditched bread, pizza and pasta and ate lean meat with plenty of vegetables instead.

After six months, he decided to take up running, starting with short distances and took up kick-boxing.

'I enjoyed it as I could go for jogs by the Thames,' he said.

In October 2006, he took part in a 45-mile bike ride from St James' Park in London to Eton College for the Prince's Trust.

By nine months Bob had shed impressive five stone and lost 10inches from around his waist.

'One of the best moments of my life was being able to walk into a shop and buy a pair of 32 inch waist trousers,' he said.

'I had a 42 inch waist for as long as I could remember.'

'I looked and felt like a different person even some of my relatives did not recognise me. I felt great and looked thin.

'I then gave my self a challenge and took a biking holiday in Slovenian Alps. The views were breathtaking but the hills were big and challenging. One took me 50 minutes to get up.'

What a difference: Mr Baker before he tackled his paunch (l) in 2006 and competing in a triathlon in 2011 (r)

New challenge: Bob lost 9lbs on a nine-day training trip for the Clipper Venture Yacht Race

Then in 2010, Mr Baker got a personal trainer to help tone up his muscles.

'I had gone on holiday to Turkey with my wife Lilian and she said I looked like skin and bone,' he said.

'She prefers how I look now.'

After completing a duathlon Mr Baker decided to tackle a triathlon at Eton Dorney in 2011.

'I had seen people doing them on TV but never thought I could do it,' he said.

'I had to get swimming lessons though as all I could do was doggy paddle,' he said.

'I know I'm too old to win anything but I'm happy as long as I don't come last.'

His latest challenge will be taking part in the Clipper Venture Yacht Race this
summer. He plans to complete two legs of the round-the-world trip on a 
racing yacht. He will sail 5,000miles from the west coast of America, 
through the Panama Canal to New York and then travel a further 
3,750miles back to London.

'I've taken part in two training sessions and during my last nine-day trip I dropped nine pounds,' he said.

'You have to eat lots of carbs because you burn 6,000 calories a day working on the yacht.

'It's different as you are working in a team and I'm used to being on my own. They are mostly consultants, professors and engineers but we do get on. I like baking and bring along my home-made cakes, which boosts morale!'

Mr Baker is fitter now (right) then he was 20 years ago (left). He still drives lorries but exercises every day

Today Mr Baker, who now works night shifts, is fighting fit. Each day he takes his two dogs for an hour and a half each day before heading to the gym or getting his wife to drop him 10km from home on her way to work.

And his adventuring won't stop after he's sailed the high seas. Next, the Essex lorry driver wants to trek to the North Pole and take part in a six day race across the Sahara desert.

'I want to push my boundaries and see what I am capable of achieving,' he said.

'I want to really live my life to the full.'
