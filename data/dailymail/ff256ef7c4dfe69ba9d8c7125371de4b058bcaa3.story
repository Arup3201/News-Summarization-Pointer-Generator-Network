A tourist from Belgium had her life saved in a dramatic rescue from the top of Jim Jim Falls in Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory.  

The 59-year-old's husband set off a beacon to alert emergency services to the situation. 

CareFlight carried out the rescue effort 11 days after a German tourist was found dead in a car park nearby, reports ABC.

Kakadu Park operations manager Anthony Contarino told ABC that the woman might have died if the emergency services had not have got to her in time.

He said: 'A great deal of effort was put in by emergency services. 

'Without all those things occurring, it might have been a very different outcome.' 

Mr Contarino explained that the temperature where the woman was stranded was 10 degrees hotter than on the ground and that the track to the top of the falls had been closed due to the heat. 

The 59-year-old woman was suffering from dehydration when she was found

He told ABC that they got news of the emergency beacon on Saturday afternoon and they spent the time searching for the patient. 

He explained that the woman was trapped in an area of the park which was closed and they would be carrying out an investigation into how it happened. 

He added that tourists walking on the tracks needed to be aware of the hot weather conditions and be 'responsible for their own safety'. 

Jim Jim Falls are 259 metres (850 ft) high and are located near the eastern boundary of the national park and 28 kilometres south of Jabiru.
