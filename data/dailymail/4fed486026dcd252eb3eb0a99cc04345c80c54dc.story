A controversial sex education film made by Channel 4 for primary schools has been withdrawn from sale after an education Minister criticised it as ‘shocking’.

Schools Minister Nick Gibb had summoned executives from the state-owned channel and asked for explicit scenes to be axed from the film, called Living And Growing.

The withdrawal of the film from sale follows a long-running campaign by parents and MPs, who say parts of it are like ‘a blue movie’.

Controversial: An image from the Channel 4 DVD Living And Growing. The target audience for this film is children as young as eight

It includes a section aimed  at children as young as five, asking them to name the body parts on a drawing of a naked man and woman.

Another segment intended for eight-year-olds shows a naked cartoon couple chasing each other around a bedroom with  a feather before having sex.

Although the film should be used by 
schools only after consultation with governors, many parents say they 
were not made fully aware of its graphic contents.

At
one London school, which still intends to show the film, a third of 
parents plan to withdraw their children in protest, and have handed out 
leaflets at the gates while wearing T-shirts reading Too Much Too Young.

Mr Gibb said: ‘Parents will be shocked that this type of material is present in primary schools and even more surprised that councils are recommending it.’

A spokesman for Channel 4 said: ‘Espresso Group, which licenses the rights to the Living And Growing DVDs, has decided to remove the titles from its product catalogue.’

But the national body representing sex education teachers, the PSHE Association, said it was ‘disappointed’ at the decision, and blamed ‘vociferous lobbying .  .  . by a small but influential number of politicians, parents and  Right-wing religious groups’.
