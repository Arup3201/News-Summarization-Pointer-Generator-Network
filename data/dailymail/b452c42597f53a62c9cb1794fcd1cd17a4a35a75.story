An Ohio couple took a waitress for a ride last month when they skipped out on their tab and injured the server as they drove away with her desperately clinging to the roof of their car.

Police are asking for people to identify the diners spotted in surveillance video at the Coram Diner in Long Island, New York who had a meal at the diner then left without paying their $80 bill.

The young couple, who were filmed entering the diner on February 20 in light colored pants and a dark tops, can later be seen leaving the diner as their female waitress trails behind them.
