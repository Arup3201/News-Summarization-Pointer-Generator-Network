As the owner of a food shop, Sarah Lemon was constantly surrounded by temptation - and saw her weight balloon to 27 stone 7lb.

The 43-year-old, from Cheltenham, Gloucester, spent years overeating and snacking on the treats that she sells at her upmarket delicatessen, resulting in the pounds piling on.

However, the final straw came in 2013 when Sarah realised her size 30 frame would not fit into a plane seat, and she changed her eating habits - and lost half her body weight in just 18 months.

Sarah Lemon, 43, from Cheltenham, Gloucester, shed more than half of her body weight - 15st - in under 18 months, despite dealing with tempting delicacies every day in her job as a deli owner

The mother-of-two, who had been overweight since a child, swapped slices of ham and biscuits for grapefruit and toast after speaking to a Cambridge Weight Plan consultant based in the office above her shop.

Sarah endured six torturous months of not eating any traditional food, only protein-heavy meal replacement products.

She then introduced a small evening meal for six months - all while resisting the tasty food on sale in her deli. 

Within a year Sarah dropped 13st 1lb  and lost a staggering 20.5ins off her waist and 27ins off her hips.

Mother-of-two Sarah, pictured at her heaviest, had been overweight since childhood, which she attributed to emotionally-motivated binge eating

She's now shed more than half her body weight and plummeted 18 dress sizes to a size 12-14 and tips the scales at 12st 6lb.

The weight loss has been so dramatic that people no longer recognise her - especially customers coming into her Lots Of Lemons shop in Cheltenham.

She said: 'About six months ago one elderly customer asked me very sternly "What happened to that other very stout girl that used to work here?"

'I replied with a very big smile: "That’s me ma’am!". "Well I never," she replied whilst reeling backwards!'

Mother-of-two Sarah had been overweight since childhood, which she attributed to emotionally-motivated binge eating.

'Looking back, food has been my crutch and my drug of choice for my entire life and I had reached an enormous weight,' she said.

'Never have I wanted to be fat, even at my darkest points and my deepest binges.

'I hated the way food controlled me and dictated my life, from the clothes I wore to how I felt about myself. I felt useless and pathetic and a complete failure.'

At the beginning of 2013, her doctor recommended fitting a gastric band after her BMI hit 60 - twice the obese level of 30.

But she says the produce in her shop was easier to resist once she decided to shed the pounds.

'Following a diet plan made it easier for me to work in the deli - because I couldn’t make any decisions about what I was eating,' she said.

'Before that, it was lethal. It was just too easy to have a snack in the deli. I did not once - in one year - have one thing I wasn’t meant to have. I didn’t put a piece of ham off the slicer into my mouth, I didn’t take a biscuit out of the jar.'

The weight loss has been so dramatic people have stopped recognising her, even customers from her deli

Now she is off her strict plan, Sarah has a light breakfast of half a grapefruit and a piece of toast, a Cambridge product for lunch and whatever the family is having for dinner.

But Sarah does not feel the battle with her weight is over. 'I feel scared that I will go back there one day,' she said.

'It terrifies me. But I am incredibly grateful that I found tools to fix a problem I made. I am slimmer, healthier and happier with myself than I have been in over 25 years.'
