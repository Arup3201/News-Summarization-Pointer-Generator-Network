A gardener who cheated death after a pickaxe hit him in the middle of the forehead took a bus to hospital after he was told an ambulance was not necessary.

Sheldon Mpofu, 37, was turning soil in his garden when he swung the pickaxe down, catching it on a washing line which then caused it to recoil and hit him in his head.

The pointed end of the tool entered his skull, but it remarkably missed his brain and entered a sinus cavity.

With blood pouring from the wound, Mr Mpofu contacted the non-emergency NHS 111 number and was told an ambulance was not necessary but he should go to hospital within an hour.

So he bandaged up the wound and took a bus to St James's Hospital, in Leeds, where doctors were stunned the pickaxe had not killed him.

Medics had not immediately realised how serious the injury was, but an X-ray and CT scan revealed just how far the pickaxe had entered.

Mr Mpofu, of Morley, West Yorkshire, said: 'They said there are sinuses in the forehead which are essentially empty spaces. It was just a few millimetres from entering my brain.

'How it didn’t go through was amazing. They told me I was a celebrity round the hospital.

'The doctor said "do you realise how lucky you are?". Everyone was telling me I’d been so lucky.'

The accident happened last month as Mr Mpofu was preparing his garden to lay some turf.

Mr Mpofu had five stitches and was kept in hospital overnight.

He said a number of doctors visited him after hearing about his injury.

Mr Mpofu said he has been suffering headaches but the wound is healing and he has been told he does not need an operation.

He said: 'I feel like I’ve had a second lease of life. It’s made me value life because anything can happen. I will definitely use my pickaxe again - but very carefully.

'It still amazes me. We are short of miracles. I’m a Christian and I want to let people out there know that miracles can happen.'

He was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary by ambulance where specialists in the field are based.
