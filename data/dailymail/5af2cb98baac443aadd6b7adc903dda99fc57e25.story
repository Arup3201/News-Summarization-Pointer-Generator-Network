Far from enjoying the quiet of the countryside, what farmyard animals really want to hear is a good rock song from the likes of Aerosmith and Bon Jovi - preferably on Radio 2.

A survey carried out by RSPCA Freedom Food showed 77 per cent of farmers in the east of 
England play music or sing to their livestock, tipping Radio 2 as the
most popular radio station for animals, followed by Radio 1.

Among the artists to have found a new fan base in pigs and cows are Adele, Bon Jovi, Coldplay and Eminem, according to farmers.

Farmers have said livestock enjoy listening to rock music, preferably on Radio 2

They also admitted to singing hymns, rugby songs and piggy nursery rhymes to keep their animals relaxed.

But it isn't just the sound of music that puts the farm animals in a good mood.

The research found livestock also 
enjoyed keeping up to date with  current affairs and sport from Radio Five Live and Radio Four's Today
programme.

It follows research from Writtle College in 
Essex which found that playing background music can have a positive 
effect on sows and piglets by increasing suckling and making mothers more 
playful.

Bon Jovi is a top choice to keep animals happy

Mark Hayward of Dingley Dell Pork in Woodbridge, Suffolk, has taken the theory one step further and has his own house band the Broadside Boys.

He said: 'We often sit on the hay bales, singing and strumming to our Freedom Food pigs and I’m convinced they love it.

'And when the bands not playing we have music on all the time, coming from the tractors or my truck.

'It’s really important to be relaxed and calm around farm animals because they respond to your mood and in turn become more chilled out too.

'Music and also talking to our animals is a key part of that. I chat away to my breeding sows all the time, although the piglets are often too busy to stay still long enough to listen.'

The survey found that more than half of farmers, 59 per cent, talk to their animals with hot topics including the weather and how they are feeling.

Tracks by Coldplay also proved to be a hit among the herds

RSPCA farm animal scientist, Dr Marc 
Cooper, said: 'Chatting to farm animals may sound daft but there is a 
clear welfare message behind Freedom Food’s survey.

'The farmers said that their animals are more content, relaxed and calm when they interact with them in this way.

'Like our pets, farm animals are intelligent, sentient beings and respond well to positive interaction.'
