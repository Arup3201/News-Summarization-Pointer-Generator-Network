THIS has to be the ultimate leap into the unknown. To boldly go where no man, or woman, has gone before — and never come back.

Yet that’s what 200,000 space enthusiasts applied to do — be among the first 24 people to take a one-way journey to Mars. And stay there for ever.

The £4 billion Mars One project, being filmed for a reality programme, has whittled that list down to 100, including five Britons.

Ready for takeoff: Maggie Lieu, 24, a PhD student in astrophysics at the University of Birmingham, is one of five British hopefuls who may be sent to Mars for its first permanent human colony

If things go according to plan, the first permanent human colony on Mars will be set up in 2024 by a Dutch non-profit company called Mars One. The idea is that crews of four astronauts will depart every two years.

But how on Earth — or on Mars — could you look forward to leaving your family and friends behind to go live on the Red Planet?

‘I was up all night waiting for the news,’ said one of the 100 chosen ones, Ryan MacDonald, a 21-year-old student from Derby, doing an MA in physics at Oxford. ‘I got the email from the selection committee at 6am.

‘I felt completely awed and shocked. The fact I now have a chance of going into astronaut training is incredible.’

There are still several hoops to leap through for Ryan and the other four British, aspiring astronauts: Hannah Earnshaw, 23, a PhD student in astronomy at Durham; Alison Rigby, 35, a laboratory technician, from Kent; Clare Weedon, 27, a systems integration manager for Virgin Media, from Surrey; and Maggie Lieu, 24, a PhD student in astrophysics at the University of Birmingham.

Ready to leave: Fellow hopeful Ryan MacDonald, a physics student at Oxford University, says that as he knows when he'll leave Earth, he can live life to the fullest

They will be tested on their responses to stressful situations before they find out if they’ve made it at the end of this year.

‘My family, particularly my grandparents, are very pleased,’ insists Ryan, who has wanted to be an astronaut since he was a little boy. ‘Although my grandfather said: “Don’t forget to focus on your studies.” My younger sister isn’t quite so keen.’

Ryan speaks as if he is planning a long-haul holiday: ‘You know a precise date when you’re leaving. So you get ten years to live your life to the fullest, to experience all the wonders the world has. That makes your quality of life much better than if you just live the day-to-day drudge for the next 50 or 60 years.’

Ryan’s plan is to travel as much of the world as possible over the next decade. In the meantime, he will do a doctorate in astrophysics. And if he fails to be selected, he hopes he might get a late call-up if someone else drops out: ‘People change their minds.’

As an astrophysics expert designing a thermal camera for Martian missions, Ryan knows a bit about the tricky living conditions on Mars — certainly a little different from life in his home-town of Derby.

It is known as the Red Planet because it’s covered in rust-coloured iron oxide. There’s no liquid water on its surface because of the low atmospheric pressure — 100 times lower than Earth’s. Any water is simply vapour — there’s no pressure to hold it down.

L ike Earth, Mars has plenty of ice at its polar caps. During Martian winters, those poles are in complete darkness. When sunlight returns, the poles are hit by 250mph winds — a little brisker than Derby on a blowy day. Temperatures hit −143°C lows at the polar caps, and more reasonable 35°C highs at the equator.

Fingers crossed: Clare Weedon, 27, a systems integration manager for Virgin Media, from Surrey, also wants to go to Mars

‘They have four seasons, like us,’ Ryan says, as if he was talking about a holiday in the Sahara. ‘The dust storm season lasts from summer to late autumn. You can get global dust storms, engulfing the entire planet for 60 Martian days [40 minutes longer than days on Earth]. That will affect our solar panels [which supply power] — we’ll have to ration supplies then.’

Cynics will not be surprised the Mars One operation is being filmed by Endemol, the Dutch company that created the reality TV series Big Brother, which brought out the very worst in human nature.

The selected Brits have dismissed suggestions that the training process is more of a publicity stunt for the TV show than a genuine attempt to get humans to Mars.

But, if the astronauts do actually reach their destination, many scientists are convinced the trip is not only foolhardy but could be fatal. Experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the U.S. have concluded: ‘The first crew fatality would occur approximately 68 days into the mission.’

Low air pressure, a shortage of spare parts for ventilation machinery and the risk of explosion all put human life at risk. Any breakdown in the machinery that would produce food and oxygen would bring starvation and suffocation.

The oxygen would be produced by splitting water vapour into its constituent parts, hydrogen and oxygen. Other researchers have said the high levels of radiation would increase the risk of cancer, and reduce the chances of reproduction. It certainly is no picnic. So why is Ryan keen to go?

‘It’s not about running away; it’s about running towards Mars,’ he says. ‘Back in the past — when people emigrated to Australia — that was a one-way trip, too. They couldn’t pay for their way back. They had to wait six months for a letter. I can’t have a live conversation, but I can send friends and family video messages. It’ll take about 40 minutes to get a reply.

‘It’s about starting a new chapter in our life. I’m not going to Mars to die; I want to live there.’

The difference is there’s quite a lot more oxygen in Australia. When the wind drops on Mars, it’s hard to catch your breath — the air is 96 per cent carbon dioxide.

Ryan would also face terrifying health problems.

Scientists predict that if any human spent more than ten years on Mars, their bone density would decrease and their muscles would waste away. On Mars, the gravitational forces on astronaut’s bodies would be much lower, meaning bones are put under less stress, have to work less hard, and so decrease in mass and density.

If people do decide to return home — a seven-month journey which there is no guarantee they could begin because there is not enough power on the planet to launch a rocket — their bones might be so thin that, the moment they took a step on Earth, they might snap.

The Mars One boffins’ idea is that, before any humans land on Mars, a communications satellite and robotic lander will go there, followed by an intelligent rover — a small car that will navigate the Martian landscape.

Starting life: Maggie is hoping to be able to give birth to the first 'Martian' as part of the permanent colony

These devices would track down a suitable landing site for habitation modules — caravan-like pods — and “plant production units”, where they will grow vegetables and oxygen-producing plants. When the first people arrive, all this will be waiting for them. Still, it’s hardly the Ritz.

‘It will be confined and it will be very difficult for the first crews, but they are the pioneers,’ says Ryan. ‘You have to start somewhere.’

O n Mars, Ryan would have the chance to continue his astrophysics studies and indulge his passion for writing science fiction. It will be harder, though, to indulge his other hobbies — long-distance cycle rides, runs and climbing in the Peak District. ‘Because of the high radiation levels you can only go outside three hours every couple of years,’ he says.

Ryan does admit to being scared of take-off and landing — the most risky things on Space Shuttle missions. ‘There’s a three per cent chance of dying on take-off,’ he says, ‘Slightly greater than the risk of climbing Everest.’

Another British hopeful, astrophysics student Maggie Lieu, from Coventry, is keen to be among the first to give birth on Mars.

‘I think that raising a child on Mars is no different than on Earth,’ Maggie writes on her blog. ‘Yes, giving birth on Mars could be dangerous but there is no research to say for certain.

‘Yes, the children of Mars will be in a confined space; however they won’t know any better. What’s more, they will be growing up with some of the most intelligent people of Earth. They will be eating healthy foods, grown on Mars, as opposed to all the junk food we have access to on Earth.

‘They will have an unexplored terrain as their back garden. I couldn’t think of anything better.’

The question of the first little Martians has been considered, too, by Mars One’s chief medical officer, Dr Norbert Kraft,52, a former NASA crew selector.

‘They aren’t encouraged to reproduce,’ he says. ‘You don’t want a little toddler running round — that’s not very wise.

‘We will train them in giving birth, pregnancy and sonography [diagnostic medical procedures that use high frequency ultrasound] just in case an accident happens.’

It would seem inevitable, though, that relationships will be formed on Mars. And dating in space has its pitfalls. According to Dr Kraft, people pairing off into couples would be a complication. He says that such a closed environment would lead to people striking up a relationship very quickly.

How the group would deal with such pairings — and any subsequent break-ups — is a key area the scientists are looking at. Dr Kraft says: ‘People need eight to ten years of training to see how they cope.’

Squabbling couples? Affairs and accidental pregnancies? Life on won’t be so different from Earth, after all.
