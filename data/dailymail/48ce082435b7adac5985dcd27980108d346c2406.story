A man who managed to dodge police for two decades by hiding in his native Bangladesh, after carrying out a killing in Indiana, has been sentenced to 40 years in prison after being of the run for almost a quarter of a century.

Mahfuz Huq, 47, expressed remorse and cried before a packed courtroom as Steuben County Superior Court Judge William Fee handed down the maximum sentence under a plea agreement.

Huq, a naturalized U.S. citizen, pleaded guilty in November to voluntary manslaughter in the August 9, 1989, fatal stabbing of 19-year-old Todd Kelley at the victim's home in Hamilton, about 30 miles north of Fort Wayne.

Kelly was seen as his 'romantic rival' in the murder that took place almost 25 years ago.

How it happened: In the late 1980¿s Huq and Todd Kelley (pictured) were both interested in the same woman.  Huq stabbed Kelley to death in Kelley¿s Hamilton home in 1989 and then fled to his native country of Bangladesh for more than 20 years

After the slaying, Huq left the U.S. and lived in Bangladesh, where authorities were unable to reach him due to extradition laws.

He was arrested in India in February 2011 when he arrived in New Delhi to take part in a table tennis training camp and was returned to Indiana last July after fighting extradition.

In exchange for Huq's guilty plea, 
prosecutors dismissed charges of murder and intimidation as well as a 
six-count burglary case.

Kelley's
 body was found by his girlfriend, Christine Mutzfeld, who had been in a
 previous relationship with Huq. Court documents said cigarette butts at
 the murder scene indicated Huq waited for Kelley outside Kelley's home.

Huq,
 who was 22 at the time, was charged with murder two weeks after the 
slaying. At the time, Huq already was accused of threatening to kill 
anyone who dated his former girlfriend.

A
 report by an Indiana State Police technician said Kelley was first 
stabbed in the back and it appeared he was 'taken by surprise.'

The case was featured on the television programs 'Unsolved Mysteries' and 'America's Most Wanted.'

'I think for a case that’s 25 years 
old, we feel okay about him getting 40 years,' said Shannon Kelley, 
sister to Todd, their father.  'It’s at least the beginning of the end 
of a very long process for us'.

The
 courtroom heard two very different sides of Huq Monday afternoon.  In 
Bangladesh, he had been a dedicated middle school math teacher at the 
International School of Dhaka. 

Friends
 and co-workers flew in from as far as Africa and China for the 
sentencing.  They testified about his care for the students, his 
charitable work in an orphanage, and his enthusiasm in coaching high 
school tennis.

Huq, known to
 them as Asif Haque, was traveling to India with the tennis team in 2011
 when authorities arrested him at a New Delhi airport.  It floored those
 who were with him.

Huq was eventually extradited back to Steuben County in July.

Closure: Father Vern Kelley, left, and Todd Kelley's sister, Shannon, right, say they are happy with the 40-year sentence

'You can’t blame those people.  They did the very best for what they could do to tell everybody what they thought he was,' said Vern Kelley, father to Todd.  'But obviously he was not what they thought.'

On the other hand, the Kelley family spoke of 25 years of heartache for what they called a vicious and brutal crime.  Todd Kelley’s aunt told Huq, 'Today you will be sentenced, but you sentenced this family to a lifetime of heartache.

'I'm just relieved," Vern Kelley, Todd Kelley's father, says outside the Steuben County Courthouse after the sentence was handed down. "You could feel that he was going to get some kind of justice that we felt was just.

Monday would have been Todd Kelley's mother's birthday, Todd's sister Shannon Kelley says.

'I hope this is the best present ever,' Shannon Kelley says.

Huq addressed the Kelley family in court, asking for forgiveness and wishing he could turn back time.
