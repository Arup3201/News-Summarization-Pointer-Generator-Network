This is one golf buggy that doesn't amble around a scenic  course.

Named Bandit, this unusual machine has just set the fasted speed registered for a golf cart, receiving a Guinness World Record title.

The landmark was set at Darlington Dragway, South Carolina, US on October 4, with the golf buggy creator Robby Steen reaching a top speed of 118.76mph.

Robby Steen broke his own speed record for racing in a golf buggy

The golf cart zoomed through the first quarter mile in just 12.24 seconds

Robby forms a family team, called Plum Quick Motors, with father Carson and brother Ricky, and the group built the cart over six months in their spare time. 

The previous world record was held by - you got it, Robby with 103.65mph, as it zoomed through a quarter mile in 12.24 seconds. 

Speaking to Mail Online, Robby said: 'We’ve been drag racing electric golf carts since 2008. We were very confident that we could go well over the 103.65mph that we set the first Guinness World Record 'fastest golf cart'.

'We are very excited to have achieved a speed record like this and to do it with electric is even more exciting.

'I know without a doubt we can and will go much faster in the future.'

The record was set at the famous Darlington Dragway in South Carolina, US

The Plum Quick Racing website states that the team 'produce high performance golf cart motors for a wide range of applications including hunting, off road, golfing, cruising and even racing.'

Hidden away in that sentence is 'golfing' although their latest achievement has surely taken them to another level - quite literally.
