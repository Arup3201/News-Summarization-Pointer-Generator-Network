A three-year-old girl was saved from the killer disease meningitis after her mother checked her symptoms on an iPhone app.

Hollie Weeks was saved by her quick-thinking mother Claire after she became seriously ill on holiday.

Mrs Weeks had downloaded the Meningitis Trust app after a classmate of her other daughter died after contracting the condition.

Hollie was diagnosed with viral meningitis and received treatment within 20 minutes of showing symptoms thanks to her mother's quick actions

Hollie suffered a stroke down her right side but is now recovering well

Claire, 36, and father Simon, 39, from Kingswood, Bristol, rushed her to North Devon District Hospital on April 29.

The youngster was diagnosed with viral meningitis and received treatment within 20 minutes.

However,
 she still suffered a stroke down her right side and lost her speech. 
She spent two days in the Barnstaple hospital, 12 days at Bristol 
Children’s Hospital, and 11 days at Frenchay Hospital.

But Hollie, nicknamed 'little miracle' by doctors, is now battling back to health thanks to her parents’ swift actions.

She has regained most of her mobility, although still has co-ordination problems with her right hand.

Hollie struggles to concentrate for long
 periods and tires easily, but the family are hoping that before the end
 of the year she will no longer need the steroids she is on.

Claire, from Bristol, said: 'The doctors said she was an hour away from not pulling through. She’s made a remarkable recovery.

'Our brave girl suffered a stroke and lost her speech, but Hollie is a little fighter and is doing well learning to talk and with physiotherapy.

'She has some weakness down her right side, but this could have been so much worse. We feel lucky to still have her here and she has returned to play school.

'I cannot thank the hospital staff enough as they helped save her life.

'The team at Frenchay’s Barbara Russell Unit call her a ‘little miracle’ for how fast she is recovering and is still doing its best to make sure she gets back to health.

'Hollie knows what happened to her. She says "I had meningitis on holiday and the doctors saved me".'

Mrs Weeks became conscious of the 
risks of meningitis earlier this year after five-year-old Kelsey Smart -
 a classmate of Hollie's older sister Erica - died from the condition.

What is meningitis?An infection that can affect the blood, organs and the thin layer of tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord.What are the symptoms?They include high fever, headache, stiff neck, vomiting, rash, confusion and severe sleepiness.How is the disease spread?The disease is usually spread by contact with fluids from the nose and mouth of the infected person, most commonly by coughing, sneezing or kissing.Can it be prevented by vaccine?Yes, but the vaccines are not 100 per cent effective, and they do not protect against certain strains of the bacteria.

She said: 'What happened to Kelsey and her family is heartbreaking.

'What Hannah and James are doing to remember her and spread awareness is so special. If it weren’t for their determination, I would not have suspected meningitis and rushed Hollie to hospital.

'Our
 little girl could have died, but what we learned from Kelsey’s story 
was enough to get us to rush our daughter to hospital, which saved her 
life.

'If my family can
 spread awareness of meningitis through our and Kelsey’s stories, and 
save even one life - it will be worth it.'

The Kesley Smart awareness campaign is run in aid of Meningitis UK.

The early symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia can include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and muscle and joint pain.

These can often look like other more 
common illnesses like flu. Symptoms can worsen rapidly so it's important
 to keep checking them.

The
 Meningitis Trust says parents should trust their instincts. 'You know 
your child, a loved one, or your own body, better than anyone else. If 
you think it is meningitis, say so,' they advise.
