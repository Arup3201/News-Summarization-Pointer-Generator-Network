Andy Goode was a picture of anguish at the Ricoh Arena as his last-gasp shot to cap a courageous Wasps fightback flew wide of the posts but this dramatic draw may yet be enough for a quarter-final place.

At half-time yesterday, the home side had appeared down and out; destined to lose this Pool Two decider and fall short in their quest to qualify for the last eight of the inaugural European Champions Cup. They were 20-6 adrift at that stage and barely had a toe-hold in the game as Leinster carved them open with alarming ease.

But by the end, the tables had been turned in emphatic fashion. Dai Young’s men claimed 14 unanswered points after the break with two converted tries and they so nearly snatched a memorable victory.

In the last minute, Wasps pounded on and on into opposition territory and once they had breached the Irish visitors’ 22, Goode set himself for the high-stakes drop goal. If he had hit the target, his club would have gone through as pool winners. Instead, the veteran fly-half’s kick missed to the right and he was left crouched and desolate.

Yet, Wasps’ stirring rearguard action — in response to a calamitous first half — could see them qualify among the leading runners-up. Their fate is in the hands of other English teams today, namely Bath and Saracens. If the latter win or claim two bonus points in defeat at Clermont Auvergne, James Haskell and Co are likely to miss the cut, but if last year’s finalists are limited to one point, or none at all, Wasps can reach the knock-out phase, where they would face a daunting away tie.

At least they are in contention, which seemed a far-fetched notion for so long yesterday.

After another impressive personal contribution, Haskell — the home captain — said: ‘I’m disappointed and frustrated because I feel we should have had that.

‘We didn’t get it right in the first half but when we came in for half-time we realised we had to step it up and we won the second-half battle.’

Asked if he would be watching Bath — who host Glasgow at The Rec — and Saracens with interest, he added: ‘I won’t watch any rugby tomorrow. I’ll just let it all unfold. What happens, happens.

‘We should be good enough not to have to rely on other people. We’ve showed again that we play well with our backs to the wall, but I know we are good enough to do it from the start.’

Wasps were all at sea in the first half, after flanker Ashley Johnson was sin-binned from the kick-off, for colliding with the airborne Dave Kearney. The Leinster wing was forced to go off injured moments later and his head coach, Matt O’Connor, cast doubt on the sanction for the offence.

‘The frustration for us is that we lose a bloke for 80 minutes and they lose a bloke for 10 minutes. That doesn’t make sense to me.

‘Players have a duty of care to make sure that the guy in the air lands safely.’

Later in the first half, Wasps prop Lorenzo Cittadini received a yellow card, but Leinster also lost lock Kane Douglas to the sin bin.

The visitors, with Ian Madigan running amok in midfield — to atone in part for his persistent goal- kicking lapses — sent Fergus McFadden over in the right corner early on and Isaac Boss touched down just before the break. But Wasps rallied strongly in the second half and their driving maul yielded two tries in the left corner, from attacking penalties.

The home pack forced England prop Matt Mullan over the line in the 62nd minute and, seven minutes later, Nathan Hughes lunged to score from close range.

Goode landed the wide conversion at the second attempt to level the match, after Leinster players had rushed out too soon, but their pressure on the Wasps No10 at the end paid off, sending the Irish side into the quarter-finals as pool winners.
