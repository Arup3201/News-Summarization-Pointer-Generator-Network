A California man whose truck flipped over and crashed into a tree Thursday fled the scene, leaving his girlfriend trapped upside down in the vehicle.

Police say 24-year-old Jon Holley was driving in Glen Ellen, California when he took a turn too quickly and overturned his 2006 Nissan Frontier.

Holley was driving on a suspended license from a previous DUI and fled the scene, leaving his 23-year-old girlfriend Sada Washington behind, stuck in her seat belt.

Chivalry is dead: Jon Holley, left, was still being sought by California Highway Patrol Sunday after police say he flipped his truck, leaving girlfriend Sada Washington, right, trapped inside

Washington pulled from the car by responders and taken to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, where she was treated for minor injuries.

That night, Washington was understandably helpful with police in their search for Holley.

However, her fury has evidently since cooled because she’s no longer aiding the California Highway Patrol in their investigation.

‘They’ve probably made amends,’ CHP Officer Nenad Gorenec told MailOnline.

Not-so-perfect couple: Police say Holley, right, was driving on a suspended license Thursday night when he flipped the car and that he likely fled fearing the repercussions. Police also suspect he was driving under the influence

As of Sunday afternoon, Holley remained at large and faces a hit and run charge as well as possible DUI.

Despite her unwillingness to help cops find Holley, she hinted at her annoyance over his distinct lack of chivalry in a Thursday post to Facebook.

‘Can I move now,’ she asked.

She also hinted at their shared love of speed, writing back in May:

‘Fast and Furious 6!!!!! Whooo!!!! -- feeling excited with Jon Holley Murphy.’

Meanwhile, Holley's most recent post--dated November 18--makes him sound surprisingly chivalrous:

'Bare knuckle up an get your teeth nocked n tha dirt if your gonna flirt with my girlie.'

Must have made up: While police say Washington was helpful at first, she is no longer aiding their investigation. Holley is being pursued on hit and run charges, as well as possible DUI
