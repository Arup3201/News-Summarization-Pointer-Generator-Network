A family shamed by a trendy restaurant on social media for walking out without paying their bill have now settled their tab.

Burger & Lobster posted a CCTV picture on its company Facebook page showing a mystery family apparently leaving its new restaurant in The Hayes, Cardiff.

Next to the photograph, a staff member wrote: 'To this family that walked out tonight without paying their bill, we are sure this was just a 'mistake' and you completely forgot, so out of the goodness of your heart please call the restaurant tomorrow to pay the bill. Thanks.'

The post, which appeared on Facebook this week, triggered a flood of protests from other customers who were furious at the family being 'shamed' in public over the apparent bill blunder.

However, Burger & Lobster insisted today that the post was 'made with the intention of encouraging the guest in question to come back and pay for their mistake to rectify the loss for the business.'

A spokesman said the family had now settled the tab for their meal – which is thought to have cost in the region of £80.

The spokesman said: 'It wasn't done with the purpose of naming and shaming anyone as we are well aware that these things happen.

'As a company we take our social media policy seriously - it was posted at a local level and has now been removed.

'The table in question has now come forward and paid their bill so thank you to those who provided us with any information.

'We have taken the decision to donate the money from the bill payment to the charity Safer Wales.' 

The CCTV picture posted by Burger & Lobster on Facebook showed a man dressed in a smart grey suit jacket and jeans, a woman in a dress with a thick overcoat and two other women dressed in black trousers, scarves and coats. They appeared to be leaving the city centre restaurant.

More than 600 people commented on the image that was available for the restaurant's 3,200 fans, before the food chain deleted it.

It sparked fury among diners, with some blasting the restaurant - which offers either burger or lobster with sides - for the 'very public shaming' of the unnamed family.

Francesca Coles, a regular customer at the trendy chain said: 'People make mistakes like this all the time, especially if there is a few of them.

'I've had to go back and pay after leaving and realising. Not a very professional approach by this food chain if these customers have left in error!

'I don't like the way in which you operate and puts me off ever coming into your establishment again! Disgusting!'

Fellow customer Oliver Price said: 'Genuinely a disgrace posting this on a social media platform.

'If this is a mistake and they come back and pay how are you going to 're-inform' everyone who saw this that they made a genuine error. Terrific social faux par here.'

Mink Kleekai added: 'Disgraceful action by the restaurant, they have given this family little time to make amends before trying to publicly shame them on social media.

'Totally unprofessional management of this situation, which makes you wonder if the front and back of house are also mismanaged.'

However, while several people appeared to be against the restaurant's actions, some customers supported the post.

Chris George said: 'People moaning about the photo annoys me! If they paid there want be a problem!! 100 people prob went to that restaurant and didn't have their photo put on Facebook cause they paid for their meal!!! (sic).'

Kristen McDougal said: 'You did 100 per cent the right thing by posting the photos,' while Tom Weaver simply added: 'You did right.'

The Cardiff city centre restaurant has only been open for a month and, in line with other Burger & Lobster restaurants in the country, has just three items on the menu - a burger, lobster or a lobster roll with fries and salad.

Everything at the restaurant costs £20 so it's likely the family's bill came to around £80, or slightly more with drinks.

It is likely the family of four spent about £80 at the Cardiff city centre restaurant because everything at the trendy chain - which only offers burger or lobster - costs £20. Burger & Lobster also has branches in London

The first Burger & Lobster opened in Mayfair, London, in December 2011 and it was followed by a second, larger restaurant in Soho in July the following year.

It has since opened several other branches in the capital in Farringdon, Bread Street, Fitzrovia and on the fifth floor of Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge.

The Cardiff restaurant, the most recent to be opened by the chain, is the first UK branch to be unveiled outside of London.

The only other branch of Burger & Lobster, which is operated by Russian steakhouse group Goodman Restaurants, is the American flagship in New York - which came after its success in Britain.

The trendy chain boasts on its website as offering 'some of the best lobster around for just £20', and aims to appeal to customers by having no menu.

Instead of perusing a list of options for their meal, diners simply choose whether they wish to order burger, lobster or a lobster roll.
