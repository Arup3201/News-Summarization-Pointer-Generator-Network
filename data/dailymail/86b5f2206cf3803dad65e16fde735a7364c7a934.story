Veterans of the Battle of El Alamein gathered today for a special service to mark the 70th anniversary of the bloody battle.

The evensong at Westminster Abbey in 
London marked seven decades since the battle in North Africa -
widely hailed as the turning point in the Second World War.

Around 40 British and Australian 
veterans, many of whom are now in their 90s, were part of a 500-strong 
congregation to honour those who fought in the 14-day battle.

More than 4,000 Allied servicemen lost 
their lives and almost 9,000 were wounded in the combat that saw General
Sir Bernard Montgomery's troops defeat German general Erwin Rommel's 
Afrika Korps.

Addressing the congregation, Chief of 
the Defence Staff Sir David Richards said: 'The Battle of El Alamein was
a turning point in the Allied fortunes in the Second World War, a 
victory that Churchill referred to as a bright gleam that caught the 
helmets of the soldiers, and cheered all our hearts.

'Men from all three services played their part, not least those from my own regiment, the Royal Artillery.

'I am very proud to be here today, 
paying tribute to them, and their example of courage and professionalism
which today's armed forces constantly strive to live up to.'

Veteran Robert Lay, 91, from 
Northumberland, described the service as a 'timely opportunity' to 
remember those who fought in the battle.

Mr Lay, who served with the 5th Armoured
Tank Regiment at El Alamein, said: 'The 70th anniversary of the Battle 
of El Alamein is for me a timely opportunity for remembrance of all my 
close friends and associates, particularly my first tank crew - closer 
than brothers - who I travelled with almost all the way to Tunis.

'All of them, I believe, were killed by the time we crossed the Seine in 1944.'

During the service, two wreaths were laid at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior. The first was by the Chief of the 
Defence Staff on behalf of The Duchess of Cornwall, whose father Major 
Bruce Shand served with the 12th Lancers at El Alamein. A second wreath 
was laid by the Chief of the General Staff Sir Peter Wall on behalf of 
the armed forces.

Remembrance: Around 40 British and Australian veterans joined the 500-strong congregation

Joint forces: Nearly 200,000 British, Australian, New Zealand, South African, British Indian, Free French and Greek soldiers took part in the battle

Speaking at the service, Defence 
Minister Mark Francois said: 'I am honoured to be here today with so 
many veterans and their families on the 70th anniversary of this 
momentous battle.

'El Alamein was the first major Allied 
victory of the Second World War, and it is important that we never 
forget all those who fought so valiantly, including more than 4,000 men 
who lost their lives.'

Under the command of General Montgomery,
nearly 200,000 British, Australian, New Zealand, South African, British
Indian, Free French and Greek forces defeated the Axis powers.

At the time of the battle, which began 
on October 23, 1942 and ended on November 4, the Allies were fighting to
keep their vital supply lines open from the Mediterranean to the East.

Rommel had inflicted heavy defeats on 
Allied forces in Africa, forcing them back to the village of El Alamein,
about 60 miles west of Alexandria.

Finally, on October 23 General 
Montgomery ordered a counter-attack with almost 900 guns levelled at the
German positions to be discharged at once.

While previously the Suez Canal was 
threatened, and with it Allied access to the rich oilfields of the 
Middle East, now the Allies were able to press their advantage and 
eventually push the Germans and Italians out of Africa.

Recalling the importance of the Allied 
victory at the Battle of El Alamein, Sir Winston Churchill said: 'Before
Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein we never had a defeat.'

By October 1942, General Montgomery had amassed an army of nearly 200,000 men, more than 1,000 tanks, around 1,000 artillery pieces and more than 500 aircraft

The 70th anniversary service, led by the
Dean of Westminster The Very Reverend Dr John Hall, featured music from
the Band of the Royal Artillery with renditions of Leo Stanley's 
Alamein March and Out of Africa by John Barry.

Following the ceremony, a private reception was to be held for the veterans and their families.

The British offensive of El Alamein will
be also be marked in Afghanistan by the 4th Mechanised Brigade (The 
Black Rats), who are currently deployed as the lead formation of Task 
Force Helmand.

It was at the time of the Battle of El 
Alamein that the brigade's soldiers adopted the Jerboa or 'Black Rat' 
emblem that they continue to wear as their insignia in Helmand Province 
today.
