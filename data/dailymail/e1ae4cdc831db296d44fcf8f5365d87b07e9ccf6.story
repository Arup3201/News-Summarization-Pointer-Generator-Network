A man accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend and her male friend in a shotgun rampage has urged a jury to find him guilty so he could be back in prison in time to watch a football match.

'Remorseless': Nathan Burris ia accused of shooting Deborah Ross, and her friend Ersie Everette III, at the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge toll plaza, in San Francisco Bay, California

Nathan Burris, 49, who is representing himself in his trial in Martinez, California, snapped
 his fingers as he asked the jury to speed up so he could get back for the Monday night game.

He said: 'I 
did it. So what?' before adding 'No remorse, no regrets, no mercy. ... You want me to draw it out in crayon?'

Burris, a truck and shuttle driver stands accused of shooting Deborah Ross, and her friend Ersie Everette III, at the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge toll plaza, in  San Francisco Bay, California, in August 2009.

Giggling and smiling, Burris, who has a speech impediment, cursed the people he allegedly killed as members of the victims' family looked on, the SFgate reports. 

Prosecutor Harold Jewett asked Burris if his father would have been proud of him during cross examination at Contra Costa County Superior Court.

But after 30 minutes, Burris refused to answer any more questions, gesturing towards the jury as he said: 'This isn't Sesame Street... They get it bro'

But Burris did not get his verdict on Monday as he wanted, instead closing arguments are planned for today.

After a 13-year relationship Burris' former partner Ms Ross, 51, had planned to move out of the house she shared with him and according to her family had already started packing her things.

It has been claimed she had started to date Mr Everette, 58,  a Golden Gate Transit driver and aspiring church deacon from San Leandro.

According to the Contra Costa Times, Burris said he first fatally shot Everette in the toll plaza car park and then ran to Ross' toll booth and gunned her down while she was on duty.

Burris was arrested the day after the shooting.

He tried to plead guilty during his first court appearance, saying he was ready to die.

But under state law, capital murder suspects cannot plead guilty without a defence lawyer's consent. 

Burris has claimed that Mr Everette threatened him, leading him to an act of 'self-preservation.'

On Monday Burris again said he wanted to plead guilty saying that all that mattered was that he was alive, and they were not.

But after talking to an attorney who was appointed to advise him, Burris changed his mind and decided to preserve his right to appeal.

He told Superior Court Judge John W. Kennedy 'Why not?'

In a second trip to the witness stand, he denied Ms Ross had been moving out and said he was ready to spend the rest of his life in prison.

Grinning as he refused to answer questions he said he was just happy to be alive.

Asked why he was smiling, he said he would not be 'crying about what happened three years ago.' before adding to the jury: 'It is what it is.'

Speaking outside court to Sfgate.com, Ms Ross' 25-year-old niece, Elesha Nelson of Oakland, said she had to suppress an urge to slap the defendant.

If the jury finds him guilty of murder, along with the special 
circumstances of lying in wait and killing multiple victims, the trial 
will move to a death penalty phase.

Burris will face either 
execution or life in prison without parole.

But
 if California voters support a ballot measure today to repeal the death
 penalty, the final phase will not be held and the trial will end.

Burris would be sentenced to life in prison without parole if the jury upheld the special circumstances.
