They were meant to brighten up a rather dull roundabout.

But two blue gnomes, perhaps aptly named Grumpy and Dopey, have caused a sparked a massive war of words in the seaside town of Totnes in Devon.

The town’s Britain in Bloom group has been accused of ‘insulting the value of Totnes’ while a group called the Council of Gnomes has condemned the statues as offensive.

'It's not Las Vegas': Residents are not too sure about the latest idea to spruce up Totnes, blue gnomes

It all started when members of the town's Britain in Bloom group put out an appeal to smarten up its main roundabout.

The blue statues called Grumpy and Dopey were then donated by a local china company and now stand on the Coronation Road roundabout which fallen into neglect after recent cutbacks.

Around 27,000 drivers a day pass the roundabout on their way through Totnes into the South Hams.

Speaking at the time the statues were put up Vernon Gay of china firm China Blue said: 'Totnes has been voted the third wackiest town in England by British Airways so I thought we should live up to our reputation and have some Disney figures living on the roundabout - coloured blue of course.’

But since then the gnomes have come under attack by unhappy locals and a group called the Council of Gnomes saying they are in fact dwarves and not gnomes at all.

Chris Keleher , who lives in Totnes, said: 'The offending gnomes may be appropriate in Las Vegas or in Disneyland but to claim that they enhance the image of Totnes in any way is to insult the values of what Totnes is supposed to stand for.

‘At a major entrance to the town we should be presenting visitors with that kind of image rather than these tacky things which some misguided souls believe reflect the spirit of the place.’

But Diana Cusack, of Totnes In Bloom, defended the move.

She said: 'What’s not to like? Blue gnomes are just a question of personal taste.'

And someone describing themselves as Esbe Taloo, secretary general of the Council of Gnomes, wrote a letter to Totnes in Bloom, saying : 'It has come to our attention that the ornaments of cartoon Disney dwarves on the roundabout in Totnes are being called gnomes.

'We would like to explain that a dwarf is a small human, who is seen as having a disability due to the problem of having to fit into a larger-scale society.

'A gnome is a non-human being that inhabits a different society, as do elves, pixies and fairies.  'We would like you to desist from calling cartoon dwarves gnomes.'
