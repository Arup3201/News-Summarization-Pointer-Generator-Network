UKIP leader has vowed to stand down as leader if the party fails to breakthrough in next year's election

Nigel Farage has vowed to resign as party leader if UKIP fails to achieve a general election breakthrough next year.

The UKIP leader said there was ‘not one ounce of complacency from me’ after he was selected last night to stand in the South Thanet seat for UKIP at next year's general election.

His nomination was overshadowed by Boris Johnson’s decision to throw his hat into the ring to be the next MP for Uxbridge in west London.

But Mr Farage said he confident that the Tories would lose votes to UKIP at the next election.

He said: ‘I'm not pretending for one moment that it's going to be easy, but Ukip is offering something different and distinctive.

‘If we'd failed in the European elections I would have stood down, if we fail next year the party will pick someone better than me, but do you know what? That ain't going to happen.’

Mr Farage meanwhile told The Telegraph that Mr Johnson will be a ‘problem’ for the Tories after the next election.

He said: ‘He [Boris] will be a problem for the Conservatives. He will appeal to the Tory grassroots, and have that little certain something that Mr Cameron appears to be struggling with.’

Mr Farage added: ‘While Boris on a good day sounds fairly Eurosceptic, and says that we must do this, that, and the other, the reality is that this is the same Boris who advocated an amnesty for all of the illegal immigrants in London a Boris who on a tour of India last year said EU membership was vital to the British economy.

‘So yes, Boris Johnson is engaging, people like him, but in policy terms, certainly at the moment, he’s a long way from the position that our voters are really looking for.’

He said: ‘Ukip will be a force in the House of Commons next year and if we get this right we may find ourselves in a hung parliament holding the balance of power.’

Leaked polling suggested that UKIP will target seats on the east and south coast of England held by Tory MPs, including three government ministers.

The revelation reignited fears among the Conservatives that a strong UKIP performance could split right-wing voters and help Ed Miliband into power.

However, speaking after his selection, Mr Farage said that his party will target Labour too: ‘Somebody once said I was David Cameron's worst nightmare. Well that's not true, I want to be Ed Miliband's worst nightmare too. This idea that Ukip voters are all ex Tories is baloney.’

London Mayor Boris Johnson will be used by the Tories to undermine the appeal of Nigel Farage and UKIP in the next election

Mr Farage’s comments come as polls showed more voters welcome the return of Mr Johnson to Parliament than the prospect of UKIP winning seats next year.

A survey by YouGov has found 57 per cent of the public believes the London mayor’s decision to return to Parliament is ‘good thing’.

Two thirds also believe it is likely that he will one day lead the Conservative party.

By contrast, just 33 per cent think Mr Farage's candidature for Ukip in South Thanet is a positive thing, versus 54 per cent who think the opposite.
