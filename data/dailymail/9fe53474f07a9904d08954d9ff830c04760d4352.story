Horrific: Brett Lee Curtis, 28, kidnapped his ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Hamilton, 26, on Monday night before leading police on a chase and killing himself

A 26-year-old woman abducted by her ex-boyfriend who led police on a high-speed chase before killing himself says she always 'knew that he had something wrong'.

Brett Lee Curtis, 28, kidnapped Elizabeth Rae Hamilton when she finished work at Lakeland Square Mall, Florida, late on Monday night and forced her into a car.

Curtis threatened to kill her early Tuesday morning - the same day he was due to face court for a restraining order Hamilton had filed against him.Â 

The couple had dated for three years and were engaged briefly.

'I knew that he had something wrong, but no, I didn't have any proof of anything,' Hamilton told ABC News.

'I didn't want to get shot. There were eight police cars behind us. Lights, so bright, and they were screaming.'

Hamilton had a tumultuous relationship with her ex-boyfriend.

According
to Polk County court records, Hamilton's father, Joe Hamilton, filed 
for an injunction against Curtis on September 27, claiming Curtis 
threatened to hurt him, his wife Robin and their daughter.

The injunction hearing was set for Tuesday - the day of the abduction.

That's what led police to think Curtis, from Lakeland, was the kidnapping suspect.

When Robin Hamilton
went to pick up her daughter from work at A Great Asian Massage about 
7.30pm on Monday, she wasn't there and her purse was thrown on the 
ground.

Police issued a statewide be-on-the-lookout alert for Curtis and Hamilton.

The Ledger reported a South Daytona police officer spotted the white Nissan Altima that Curtis was driving about 3am on Tuesday near Beville Avenue.

Curtis didn't stop when the officer signaled him, instead leading police on a high-speed chase south on Interstate 95.

The 100m/h pursuit crossed Volusia County into Brevard County, where deputies were ready to continue the chase.

The officers continued to follow Curtis after he warned a 911 operator that he was going to start shooting.

'If he continues to follow me, I will fire warning shots,' Curtis told the operator. 'he third will not be a warning. Is that understood?'

During the chase, Curtis called 911 several times. In one call, he told the operator he had weapons inside the car and threatened to kill Hamilton.

'He's threatening to kill me if they keep following him,' Hamilton told the operator. 'He says he's got a gun. He's got a nine millimeter...He's got a rifle.'

Curtis began shooting at officers, but police did not open fire.

About 3.30am, Brevard
County Sheriff's deputies deployed 'stop sticks' and deflated all four 
of the car's tires.

As the car slowed near mile marker 225 
on the I-95, Hamilton got out of the car and ran.

She later said Curtis had told her to get out. She was not injured.

Curtis then fatally shot himself before police approached the car.

'He wasn't asking me to get back with 
him. He wanted me to spend the last moments of his life with him,' 
Hamilton told ABC's Good Morning America.

The Brevard County Sheriff's Office has opened a death investigation, while the LPD continues to investigate the kidnapping.

Robin Hamilton refused to comment on the case, but issued a statement through the Lakeland Police Department: 'We would like to express our deep gratitude and sincere 
thanks for the efforts of all law enforcement and security agencies who 
aided in the process which culminated in our daughter's safe return.

'We 
would also like to especially thank the officers and detectives of the 
Lakeland Police Department for their immediate response, steady 
determination, and exemplary manner in which they handled this matter.'
