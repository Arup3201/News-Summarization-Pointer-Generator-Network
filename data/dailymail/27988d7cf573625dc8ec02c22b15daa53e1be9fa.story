Fighting spirit: 5ft 6ins Rosie Millard screamed as loud as she could until her attacker fled

Her reaction was, by her own admission, ‘pure instinct’ and certainly not what her attacker was expecting.

Former BBC arts correspondent Rosie Millard yesterday described how she fought off a 6ft-tall thief who grabbed her mobile phone as she walked her border terrier in a park close to her £2million home.

The 48-year-old broadcaster, a mother of four, had decided to take Disney for a stroll and was leaving a message for her husband when the mugger crept up behind her and snatched the device from her hand.

However, instead of meekly accepting her plight, Miss Millard, who has a slight build and is 5ft 6ins tall, found herself grabbing hold of the robber and screaming repeatedly as loud as she could.

So alarmed was the man he threw Miss Millard into a lavender bush and dropped her Nokia Lumia phone as he fled.

Describing her actions as ‘pure instinct’ and probably ‘ill-advised’, she said yesterday: ‘‘I was leaving my husband a message on my phone when I felt this hand coming over my right shoulder and grabbing it. At first I thought it was a friend.

‘It was like a dream. I was thinking: ‘This is actually happening. My phone is being stolen.’

‘I then grabbed his hand and screamed ‘Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh’ as loud as I could. There was no one close to me so I just kept screaming.

‘The robber then pulled his arm away because I was screaming so loudly. I’ve got a really loud voice which my children are well aware of.’

Neighbours and a park warden heard her screams and chased after her attacker, who Miss Millard describes as mixed race and around 28 years-old, but without success.

The attack took place 20 yards from her £2million terraced home in the fashionable enclave of Islington, north London, at 12.20pm on Sunday.

Miss Millard praised her neighbours for coming to her aid and the police who arrived within two minutes.

She said: ‘‘The park warden and another person came running over. Lots of the neighbours heard my screams and gave chase.’

‘I now feel more vulnerable and I’m definitely going to keep my phone out of sight. It’s ironic, because I’m always telling my children to be careful where they use their phones.

‘Thinking about it, perhaps I should have let him have the phone because I worry about people with knives.

‘I hope it will make him less likely to attack a woman in the future.’

Miss Millard, who is married to TV documentary maker Pip Clothier, 53, also described the incident to her followers on social networking site Twitter.

She admitted that her reaction was ‘pure instinct’, but perhaps it was also ‘ill advised’.

Last night a Scotland Yard spokesman said officers were called to reports of a street robbery.

He said: ‘The area was searched but there was no sign of the suspect. The phone was recovered to its owner. The victim was uninjured.’

The broadcaster was the BBC art correspondent between 1995 and 2004 and now works on a freelance basis.

During the coverage of the 2001 Oscars, presenter Michael Buerk said Miss Millard had ‘the best supporting dress’ after she appeared on screen in a daring strapless Vivienne Westwood dress.
