A grim gun-toting Santa has been spotted advertising assault rifles on a billboard in California.

Steve Dyke, the co-owner of Down Range Indoor Training Center in the city of Chico, commissioned the billboard to catch the attention of drivers travelling along Highway 99 - but some people are not happy about it.

The tooled-up Father Christmas has no jolly smile, is wearing sunglasses, and wields the AR-15 firearm next to the slogan: 'We build AR's for Santa.'

You BETTER be good, for goodness sake: This billboard on the outskirts of the city of Chico, California, shows a scary-looking Santa with an assault rifle. It was put up by a gun store owner

'You know, 'tis the season, so we thought it would be a good idea,'  Mr Dyke told CBS.

'We actually got a kick out of it - thought it would be good and other people would think it was funny.'

Customer Bob Marshall supports the billboard: 'That's a  second amendment right and I believe in it fully.'

However, teacher Sara Welday told the TV station she thinks the ad is 'kinda scary'. 

Santa Claus is gunning you down: Jolly old Saint Nick is clutching an AR-15 assault rifle, a popular and controversial weapon in the U.S.

She said: 'As a teacher, I would not want my students to see that. I don't think you need to put out that as Santa has a gun.'

But Mr Dyke has no plans to take the ad down and says he has received support from customers.

He said: 'Well, you know, some people get toys and stuff like that for Christmas. Other people, when I was growing up, I got guns from Santa Claus.

'I mean, it's just a matter of where you're from.' 

The AR-15 was the gun used by 20-year-old Adam Lanza, who killed 20 first grade children and six women at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012.

A gun store that featured a picture of comedy superstar Will Ferrell alongside a controversial assault rifle was ordered to take down the advert by Hollywood executives

It was also the firearm used by James Holmes when he killed 12 cinemagoers at a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises last July in Aurora, Colorado.

A proposal by President Barack Obama to stop civilians being able to buy rifles such as the AR-15 fell apart even before reaching Congress.

An estimated five million AR-15s are now in civilian hands.

In November it was reported that a gun store that featured an advert with comedy superstar Will Ferrell alongside a controversial assault rifle was ordered to take it down  by Hollywood executives.

Family Firearms, in Valrico, Florida, featured an image from the hit 2003 Christmas film, which made more than $220million worldwide, on a flyer for a 'Build-n-AR' event in December, where customers are taught to build and then take home an AR-15 rifle for $895.

But the company which produced Elf was not happy and sent the gun store a cease-and-desist order, reports TMZ.
