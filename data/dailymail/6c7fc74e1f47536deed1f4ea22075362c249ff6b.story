A Lebanese-born Danish man who was once a radical islamist and was instrumental in the protests against Denmark in the wake of the Danish cartoons depicting Prophet Muhammad is a changed man.

Ahmed Akkari says it is thanks to one man, a teacher in America, Wes Cecil, whose online video tutorials touched him and changed his way of thinking.

Akkari, who now lives in Greenland, was furious over the cartoons which were published in a Danish newspaper, Jyllands Posten, in 2005.

In his fury, he co-wrote the the Akkari-Laban dossier, which played a major role in the cartoon controversy because it brought the issue - which would have been contained in Denmark - to the attention of influential decision-makers in the Middle East.

It created widespread anger in the region and spread across the world.

He also became famous as the head of the delegation of Danish Muslims, who traveled around the Middle East to seek support for the resistance against the newspaper and Denmark.

'Sorry': Akkari has apologised to the likes of Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, whose cartoon of Prophet Muhammad enraged him and other Muslims in 2005

But this summer Akkari returned to Denmark to apologise, saying he has turned into an apologetic agnostic.

And he’s crediting his change of faith to Cecil, according to the Oregonian.

Cecil, 47, who is a published playwright, novelist, essayist and academic, lives on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula, far away from the cartoon controversy that sparked rage across the Muslim world, and which resulted in Danish embassies being torched during protests in Denmark, Syria, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Iran.

But in his own community of 9,000, along the Salish Sea, his reputation is fabled, particularly among the 600 students who take college classes in the Old Schoolhouse building at Fort Worden State Park.

He also has over 100,000 hits on his youtube videos in which he lectures about everything from modern and ancient thinkers – the German existentialist Martin Heidegger and Greek philosopher Epicurus – to literature, culture, and the humane arts of walking, letter writing and conversation.

Kevin Webber, an 18-year-old student of  biology at Peninsula, says it is ‘hard to get your fix of Cecil’.

‘Really, he's as much a history teacher as an English teacher. He presents everything in such a comprehensive manner.’

In an interview last month with The Daily Beast, an Internet news outlet, Akkari, 35, and as curious as a college student, recommended Cecil's disquisitions.

In an interview with The Guardian newspaper in August, he told a reporter that it was after moving to the northernmost continent in the late 2000s that his mind began to change.

'I had plenty of time to read and write. And think,' Akkari said.

He embraced philosophy, starting with Danish existentialist philosopher and theologian Sren Kierkegaard, he said. 

'Plenty of time to think': Akkari embraced philosophy, and started reading the Danish existentialist philosopher and theologian, Soeren Kierkegaard (1813-1855)

Moving to Greenland: Akkari says he has undergone an 'existentialist crisis' after moving to the northernmost continent and immersing himself into Cecil's online tutorials

'He told how he had stayed in Greenland and in this epic and barren environment had undergone an existential crisis,' Danish radio host Mads Holger and cultural critic Kasper Stvring said in an English translation of a Danish news story in the Berlingske Tidende newspaper.

Repentant, Akkari apologised to Westergaard, the editors and artists at Jyllands-Posten, one of Denmark's most widely read newspapers, and others he had condemned.

That Akkari was isolated in Greenland when he underwent the transformation in his thoughts and beliefs confirms Cecil's philosophy that the French and German 17th and 18th Century ideals on reason, known as the Enlightenment, are best absorbed in still places.

‘If you're in Greenland, man, you've got some time to kill,’ said Cecil.
