A Chihuahua was left fighting for its life after being brutally savaged by a fox for the second time in four years.

The seven-year-old dog was left for dead after being attacked in its garden when it was found by his owner Vicky Neophytou.

The Chihuahua, who was close to death when found, is now nursing his injuries and recovering from severe blood loss after being set upon for the second time on Sunday.

Petrified: Mrs Neophytou found Pepe covered in blood in her garden after brutal attack

Typically weighing less than three kilograms, the Chihuahua was left with only one eye when he was first attacked by a fox in 2008.

Mrs Neophytou, of Sutton, Surrey, was first to the scene after the attack.

She said: 'It was 11.30am and I was cutting my son’s hair in the kitchen. I could hear squeaking, I thought the cat had a bird in the garden.

'I went out and Pepe was just lying there on the patio with the fox over him and there was blood everywhere.'

Mrs Neophytou was quick to react and tried to scare off the fox before attending to the helpless dog.

'I shooed the fox away, but he didn’t go far. He saw all this blood, that Pepe was close to death and obviously thought he was going to be his lunch.

'It was awful, I couldn’t talk on the phone. I was hyperventilating. I was so glad the vet was open.

'I didn’t think Pepe was going to survive in the car.'

Protected: Terry Woods from Foxagon 'Foxes are a natural fauna, we can't clinically destroy something just because we don't like it.'

During the ordeal, Pepe suffered three broken ribs and several puncture wounds. He remains at the vet in North Cheam and is not expected home for another three days.

Still aware of the potential danger of the fox, Mrs Neophytou has been advised to keep her dog flap closed, but has another dog and a cat at home.

She said: “I don’t know what to do. If I keep the dog flap closed the dogs will only be able to go out when I open the door but that means the cat can’t come and go.

Savaged: Pepe the Chihuahua is recovering from his second fox attack in four years

'I’ve contacted Foxagon (fox deterrence service) to see if they can take the fox away but they said it is illegal as it is the foxes’ territory.'

Terry Woods from Foxagon said he had advised Mrs Neophytou on how to fox proof her garden.

He said: 'Foxes are a natural fauna, we can’t clinically destroy something just because we don’t like it.'

This is just the latest in a series of fox attacks on both animals and humans over the past couple of years.

In 2010, Princess, a two-year-old Chihuahua, was savaged to death when she was snapped up by the jaws of a large fox which crept into its owner Toby Khanna's property in broad daylight.

The attack was witnessed by his devastated young children as the 38-year-old chased after the intruder.

In one of the most horrific fox attacks, nine-month-old sisters Isabella and Lola Koupparis were savaged by a fox as they lay innocently in their cots.

The attack left the young girls with 'life-changing' injuries.

In this case, a fox had gained entry to the girls' parents' £800,000 house in East London, on the night of Saturday, June 5.

The girls' parents Nick and Pauline, both 41, heard their daughters' cries over a baby monitor and dashed upstairs to find the girls with wounds that looked like they had been caused by a 'cheese grater'.
