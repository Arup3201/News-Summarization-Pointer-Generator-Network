Paralympians and politicians have accused the honours  system of favouring able-bodied athletes over their disabled teammates.

Equestrian star Lee Pearson has led 
criticism, saying he was ‘disappointed’ not to be getting a knighthood 
after winning his tenth Paralympic gold medal this summer.

Other Paralympians vented their 
frustration and a former sports minister said the honours committee had 
made a ‘big mistake’ in not giving them more recognition.

Paralympian Lee Pearson CBE won more golds than Sir Bradley Wiggins and Sir Ben Ainslie put together yet missed out on a knighthood

Pearson, who was born with 
arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, a rare disorder which means limbs do
not develop properly, was awarded a CBE in 2009, after winning three 
golds in three consecutive Games, but missed out on the top award in 
last week’s announcement.

He said: ‘It’s the discrepancy that p***** me off. Obviously, ten golds, one silver and one bronze just isn’t enough.

‘I’m disappointed because I do feel 
I’ve given a lot to Paralympic sport and equestrianism. I think ten gold
medals is quite an achievement.’

He said: ‘You can understand how Lee 
feels. I’ve won five gold medals but only got an MBE. Now there are 
athletes who have got a CBE after winning just one gold in 2012.’

It comes after Tour de France winner 
Bradley Wiggins and sailor Ben Ainslie, who each have four gold medals, 
were given the top award of knighthoods.

Paralympian David Weir wonders whether they are overlooked because they are not in the public eye

The only Paralympian to get the top 
honour in the New Year Honours list was Sarah Storey, who will be made a
Dame after winning 11 gold medals in swimming and cycling.

Yesterday, Labour MP and former sports
minister Gerry Sutcliffe said it was a ‘big mistake’ not to have 
recognised more Paralympic athletes, such as wheelchair athlete David 
Weir, who has six gold medals.

Mr Sutcliffe said: ‘There was an 
opportunity to be consistent and if you look at his record over several 
Olympics I think the least he should have got is a knighthood.

Because 
the whole purpose of the Games was to inspire a generation – and how 
better to inspire a generation of Paralympians than to give somebody a 
knighthood?’

Meanwhile, Paralympic sprint gold 
medallist Jonnie Peacock, who was awarded an MBE, wrote on social 
networking site Twitter: ‘Has to be said though, how much more does 
[David Weir] have to do to get a knighting?!’

The 2013 list was drawn up by the 
Sports Honours Committee, which was chaired by Lord Coe and included 
former Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson.

Baroness Grey-Thompson said: ‘I don’t think you can compare the Olympics and Paralympics.

‘The honours system is the fairest it’s ever been in terms of the number of Paralympians winning awards.’
