She is part of the house of Orange-Nassau and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands clearly finds her married name inspiring.

The Argentina-born Dutch royal, 43, cut a patriotic figure in her orange top as she visited the Veenkoloniaal Museum in Veendam with husband Willem-Alexander yesterday.

Maxima, who became Queen-Consort of the Netherlands in 2013, teamed her tangerine and grey Natan dress with matching orange suede court shoes and her favourite chunky jewellery.

The royal couple stopped to chat to well-wishers as they arrived at the museum, with Maxima handed a bouquet of equally patriotic tulips.

Joined by Veendam mayor, Sipke Swierstra, the pair were shown around the exhibits, which combined, tell the story of the nearby Groningen peat district.

One of the key early drivers of industry in the area, the Gronigen peat moors are more than 5,000 years old and helped to fuel trade between the Netherlands and its neigbours, as well as the UK.

More pertinently for the museum, the peat also helped to preserve the thousands of artefacts dropped into it over the years, including, most impressively, the remains of a wagon wheel dating from 2,500 BC.

Maxima, who was shown several paintings of the peat villages that once dotted the surrounding countryside, certainly appeared to enjoy her tour and asked questions of the curators as she went.

The Dutch royals were also shown into a nearby cultural centre, where they met local farmers and museum volunteers, some of whom were helping unpack boxes of maps.

All eyes, however, were on Maxima who was on vibrant form as she strode through the crowds in her striking colour-block dress, which was on its second outing.

As with much of her wardrobe, the dress was by Natan, a Belgian label that began life in a small Brussels atelier in 1930.

After almost half a century of making very little headway, the brand was taken over by Edouard Vermeulen who transformed it into a fashion force to be reckoned with. 

The label, which created the dress worn by Belgium's Queen Mathilde for her 2001 wedding, was also behind the gown worn by Maxima for her engagement portrait in 2002.

11 years later, the royal wore a nude silk gown by the same label for her inaugural balcony appearance after becoming Queen Consort of the Netherlands.
