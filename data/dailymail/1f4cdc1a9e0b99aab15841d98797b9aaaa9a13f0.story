An international human trafficking ring forced migrants to sell their organs as payment for their journey from Africa to Europe, an Italian police investigation has revealed.

Five people have been arrested as part of the probe into the gang, which allegedly arranges the harvesting of kidneys and other organs of migrants arriving in Europe by boat.

Italy, with its southern-most province Lampedusa just 80 miles from Africa, is the gateway for many seeking new lives in Europe. Almost 150,000 have made the journey so far in 2014. Around 3000 have died attempting the journey this year.

Unseaworthy: The group of Libyans and Eritreans allegedly demanded that asylum seekers pay €1,500 (£1,200) up front to board one of the often overcrowded and unseaworthy boats 

The group of Libyans and Eritreans allegedly demanded that asylum seekers pay €1,500 (£1,200) up front to board one of the often overcrowded and unseaworthy boats.

Those who could not immediately pay the full price were given the option of paying after arrival, according to court documents seen by the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.

Upon landing in Italy, the gang decided whether to 'use them as manpower or organ donors,' according to the arrest warrant.

Investigating magistrate Tiziana Coccoluto wrote that the situation of the migrants was like that of slaves, with the gangsters having the power to sell them off to other criminal groups.

Tragedy: Police suspect that other gang members are responsible for the tragedy off the island of Lampedusa last year that killed 300 people on October 3 2013

The gang's 'treasurer' Michael Brhane, was among those arrested, along with four other men - Haile Seifu, Russom Gebrem Michael Henok, and Tesfay Bahta - who allegedly worked as cashiers collecting money owed in Italy.

The five face charges of human trafficking aiding illegal immigration.

The evidence found is thought to be only the tip of the iceberg of the international trade in organs.

The bodies of migrants lacking organs are often found in the north african Sinai desert, Alganesh Fessaha, an activist campaigning against trafficking, has warned.

Last year, one of the world's most wanted organ traffickers, Gedalya Tauber, a retired Israeli police officer, was arrested in Rome.

He was previously convicted of recruiting from impoverished neighbourhoods in Brazil buying kidneys for as little as $3000, for mainly the Israeli market. The operation would then take place in a hospital in Durban South Africa with clients paying as much as 20 times the sum received by the donor.
