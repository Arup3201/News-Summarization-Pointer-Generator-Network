A mother-of-two who is at risk of cancer has chosen to have both her breasts removed and then reconstructed with a pioneering technique - using pig skin.

Kelly Cruse, 32, has seen her mother, great grandmother and cousin all suffer breast cancer - and has an 87 percent chance of developing it herself because she carries the deadly BRCA gene.

She decided to have a double mastectomy for the sake of her two young children Oliver, five, and Jamie, eight.

Breast reconstruction usually involves using tissue from another part of the patient's body - a practice that is painful and leaves multiple scars.

But thanks to a pioneering operation she now has the option of having her bust reconstructed with a new technique called 'Strattice Tissue Matrix'.

Normal implants are still used to rebuild the breast but a pig skin graft works like an internal bra - holding the implant in place and allowing natural droop of a breast.

The procedure allows patients to have their reconstruction done in an all-in-one operation, rather than the two operations normally required.

It also leaves the breasts more flexible and robust so patients can still enjoy sports and other physical activities.

A cell needs to have a number of mistakes in its genetic code before it becomes cancerous.

Doctors call these mistakes faults or mutations.

They can occur due to substances people come into contact with. Or, they can happen because of mistakes that cells make when copying their genetic code before dividing into two new cells.

Most of these abnormal cells die or are killed off by the immune system. It usually takes many years to gather enough genetic mistakes to cause cancer.

But it is possible to be born with a gene fault that increases the risk of cancer.

Scientists have identified a number of these so-called 'cancer genes'.

The first genes to be found were BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 - women with these genes have a 50 to 80 per cent chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime.

Women who tests positive can either have regular breast screenings or have surgery to remove their breasts (and possibly ovaries).

Ms Ruse, of Plymouth, Devon, had genetic testing for the hereditary breast cancer gene BRCA2 in January after her mum urged her and her sister to be tested.

After her results came back positive, Ms Ruse, a  cat breeder, took the decision to have a double mastectomy.

She said: 'Cancer is in my family. My mum has had it and so has my great grandma and my cousin.

'Because I carry the gene I've got an 87 per cent chance of getting breast cancer and by the time I'm 40 I'll probably have to have my ovaries removed too because of the risk of ovarian cancer.

'When I found out I had the gene I knew I had to have a double mastectomy. Waiting for cancer to happen is not an option.'

The graft is pigskin stripped of all pig cells so that the body doesn't reject it.

It was first developed for use in general surgery such as hernia repairs and breast reconstruction in the US and was granted approval for use in Europe in 2008.

Ms Ruse, who will go under the knife 
this week, said: 'I didn't want the usual saline implants because I'll 
be in and out of hospital a lot over the course of my life having to 
have them altered and more surgery.

'But I researched into it and found that I could have a reconstruction using Strattice. It's pig skin which is used to form a balcony and hold the implants in place as well as increase blood flow.

'I'm going to have both of my nipples removed too because the risk of breast cancer is still there if they leave them. So I'll have to have my nipples tattooed on after surgery.

'It's all a bit of a frightening prospect. I'll look normal to everyone else but I'll feel like my femininity has gone.

'I suppose I'm going to feel a bit like a mannequin but if it gives me the confidence to face people then I've got to do it.'

Ms Ruse is now urging women to push for genetic testing if cancer is in their family.

Breast reconstruction after a mastectomy can be carried out either with implants or by taking skin and fat from anywhere there is surplus -  typically the abdomen, buttocks or back - to tailor a new breast.

The latter produces a soft breast that will age with the patient, but a drawback of these complex techniques is that patients are left with a significant scar from where the spare tissue was taken, meaning a longer recovery time too.

Having an artificial implant after a mastectomy is the simplest solution, with shorter recovery times.

However, a major shortcoming is that all too often patients are disappointed with the cosmetic result — many are left with a pert, high breast without much droop and which does not match the unaffected side.

This is because all breast implants need a covering of tissue and skin over them to help anchor them in position and to provide a more natural look — and unfortunately most of this is removed if mastectomy is necessary.

The new pig skin technique still uses normal implants to rebuild the breast, but the animal skin graft works like an internal bra - cradling the implant and allowing some of the natural droop of a normal breast.

The graft, known as the Strattice graft, is pigskin stripped of all pig cells, so that the body doesn’t reject it.

With the pigskin reconstruction, the 
lower part of the pectoral muscle is teased off the ribs and the pigskin
tissue — which looks like thick, white rice paper — is stitched to the 
bottom edge of the muscle.

Next, the implant is inserted and the 
muscle and pigskin is pulled down so it covers the implant completely; 
finally, the patient’s skin is drawn down and stitched to where the 
breast fold will be.

It was first developed for use in general surgery such as hernia repairs and breast reconstruction in the U.S. and was granted approval for use in Europe in 2008.

To date, 1,200 patients in the UK have had their breasts reconstructed in this way.
