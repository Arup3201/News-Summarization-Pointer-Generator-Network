It is barely more than a room, sheltered under a wooden roof, and accessible only via a long, winding cliff-side footpath.

But if it is a room with a view you are after, look no further.

A tiny wooden cabin has gone on the market for a huge £400,000 - because it is nestled on a cliff overlooking one of Britain's most beautiful beaches.

The Cabin, which overlooks Porthkidney beach in St. Ives, is now being sold at auction with a guide price of £350,000 - but experts have tipped it go for as much as £400,000

The minuscule property only has one main room so potential buyers would have to relax, eat and sleep in the same living space.

And it is so secluded that it can only be accessed by a footpath that winds along the clifftop in St Ives, Cornwall.

Despite this, buyers have been clamouring to get their hands on the back-to-basics bolthole thanks to its panoramic beach views.

The asking price is more than double the £178,000 average price of a home in the UK.

For the same money you could buy a six-bedroom detached house in Leeds with three lounges, two kitchens and an enormous garden.

The chalet boasts a small lounge area with a double sofa and coffee table and tiny kitchen area with a single electric hob, electric fridge, microwave oven and sink.

The double bed is on a mezzanine level up a step ladder which has been squeezed in under the apex of the roof.

Tucked away below it is a small shower room with a toilet and a sink. Outside there is a small decking area  with an outdoor shower, and steps leading straight down to the beach

The retreat is said to be popular with holidaying couples and has provided the backdrop for a number of marriage proposals

'It is totally secluded only and is accessible from a footpath. Inside it is beautifully snug, with a downstairs living room, kitchenette and utility room.

'There's also a mezzanine level with a double bed.

'Outside there is a decking area overlooking the beach offering views you just won't find anywhere else.

'Its owners built it about eight years ago and since then it has been used as a holiday rental, but there's no reason why it couldn't be lived in full time.

'It's a real bolthole where couples can come to get away from life's stresses and strains. There have even been a couple of engagements there.

'There has been an incredible amount of interest in the sale.

'It may seem like a lot of money when you compare it to the price of houses elsewhere but there is simply nothing else like The Cabin.'

The auction will take place at Sandy Park Conference Centre in Exeter on Tuesday.
