Ten years ago Porto, led by an enigmatic young coach by the name of Jose Mourinho, shocked the footballing world by winning the Champions League.

But that same summer the team was dismantled. Mourinho jumped ship to join Chelsea, taking Ricardo Carvalho and Paulo Ferreira with him for a combined fee of more than £30million, while the team’s playmaker Deco was lured to the Nou Camp by Frank Rijkaard.

On Monday, Manchester City finally completed the signing of Eliaquim Mangala, for a fee of £32m, which took Porto’s income from transfer fees since they conquered Europe sailing through the £600m mark.

Not the first: Deco moved to Barcelona immediately after Porto won the Champions League in 2004

Rock at the back: Ricardo Carvalho was bought by Jose Mourinho's Chelsea in 2004 as well 

In the 10-year period between Mourinho’s touchline dash at Old Trafford and Mangala treading the now familiar path between Estadio do Dragao and the Premier League, 15 players – including the young centre-back – have left the club for more than £15m.

And of the £614m transferred into Porto’s coffers, £145.8m of has come from English clubs. Chelsea got the ball rolling when they signed Carvalho and Ferreira, before going back to Portugal to take Jose Bosingwa off the 27-time league champions’ hands.

The three Portuguese defenders cost Porto £2.5m in total, with Carvalho a product of their youth system. Chelsea spent 25 times that to take them to Stamford Bridge.

Manchester United dabbled, unsuccessfully it has turned out, in Porto merchandise when they bought Anderson (a £4.4m signing from Brazilian side Gremio) for £27.2m. Liverpool splashed out £11.4m on midfielder Raul Meireles.

And this summer it has been Manchester City’s turn – the Premier League champions showing patience to add Fernando and Mangala to their squad after courting the pair for more than six months.

Porto’s expenditure during 2004-2014 stands at £293m, less than half the amount they have pulled in through player sales. In only one of the past 10 seasons have the club spent more than they have recouped in transfer fees, when they splashed out £35.2m in 2010-11, with Joao Moutinho, James Rodriguez and Juan Manuel Iturbe among those to join – three players that later left for a total of £75.2m.

Moving on to better things: Rodriguez has just been sold to Real Madrid from Monaco after a good World Cup

2004: Paulo Ferreira to Chelsea – £17.6m

2004: Ricardo Carvalho to Chelsea – £26.4m

2007: Anderson to Manchester United – £27.2m

2008: Jose Bosingwa to Chelsea – £18m

2010: Raul Meireles to Liverpool – £11.4m

2014: Fernando to Manchester City - £13.2m

2014: Eliaquim Mangala to Manchester City - £44m (we are saying £32m)

Their track-record for buying players at low prices from lesser-known clubs and selling them on at a huge profit is remarkable.

Take Mangala for starters. Bought for just under £6m from Standard Liege in 2011, sold for five times that three years later. Rodriguez cost them £6.5m the previous year and fetched £40m when they sold him on to Monaco last summer.

Then there’s Radamel Falcao. The Colombia striker signed for around £5m from River Plate in 2009, scored 72 goals in 87 games in all competitions, including 17 (SEVENTEEN) during their successful Europa League campaign in 2010-11. This prompted Atletico Madrid to break their club transfer record and shell out £41.4m on the striker.

Other huge money-makers include Pepe, bought for £1.7m from Maritimo and sold to Real Madrid for £26.4m, and Lisandro Lopez, who joined for £2m from Argentine side Racing in 2005 and moved to Lyon for £21.1m four years later.

Their scouting work in South America particularly stands out; Falcao, Rodriguez, Lopez, Anderson, Iturbe – all bought for a pittance and sold on for eye-catching fees. And that profitable passage shows no sign of drying up, with Jackson Martinez, Juan Quintero and Hector Herrera likely to be the next set of Porto players to move to pastures new for massive amounts for massive amounts.
