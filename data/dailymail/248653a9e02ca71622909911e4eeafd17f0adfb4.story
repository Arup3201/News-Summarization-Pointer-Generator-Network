A police officer is dead and two others are critically injured after an early morning shooting in Draper, Utah.

According to a press conference held earlier at City Hall, Draper Police Chief Bryan Roberts announced that Sgt Derek Johnson had been killed responding to a 911 call around 6am.

Sgt Johnson was one of several policemen responding to an emergency call on South Fort Street.

Kris Szelag, who lives in the area told the Desert News that she heard a gunshot around 5:30am and what sounded like a car crash.

Szelag, who is a registered nurse, ran outside to see if she could help and saw an officer being pulled out of his car and administered CPR.

Sgt Johnson was eventually airlifted to the Intermountain Medical Center where he later died from his injuries.
