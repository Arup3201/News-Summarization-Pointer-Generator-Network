A jury in North Carolina handed down the death penalty Thursday to Jonathan Douglas Richardson, 25, who they convicted of murdering his girlfriend's 4-year-old daughter.

During the trial, it was revealed that Richardson tortured little Teghan Skiba for 10 days while his girlfriend of six months was on a trip - physically and sexually abusing the girl as well as strangling her with a power chord.

Richardson brought the girl to Johnston Medical Center in July 2010, telling doctors she fell off her bed. But medics found signs of much more serious trauma, as her body was covered in bruises and bite marks.

Victim: 4-year-old Teghan Skiba died in July 2010 after suffering days of torture at the hands of her mother's boyfriend of six months

Teghan died a few days later after being transferred to the University of North Carolina medical center.

Richardson was found guilty of first-degree murder, felony child abuse, kidnapping and sexual offense last week.

Lawyers made their final arguments earlier in the day Thursday as the prosecution pushed for the death penalty and the defense tried to convince the jury to chose life in prison.

Johnson County District Attorney Susan Doyle used details of Teghan's final days to justify the view that Richardson should be killed.

Richardson was given responsibility for the little  girl while her mother, Helen Roxanne Reyes, was out-of-state on Army Reserves Training.

But instead, Richard savagely beat the girl so much she lost over 70 per cent of her blood from numerous wounds.

Four-year-old Teghan died in hospital of blunt force trauma after being tortured for ten days, prosecutors said

'The defendant bit Teghan all over her body, over 60 times, and she began to slip away,' Doyle said.

Prosecutor Greg Butler called Richardson a 'sadist' and a 'killer'.

'He's cold-hearted , and he's totally without remorse,' Butler said.

According to wral.com, Dr Jonathan Privette, assistant 
chief medical examiner in Greenville, said he observed injuries to 
Teghan's neck that were consistent with markings of a power cord.

The
 doctor told the court: 'When she came to us, the brain has been damaged
 so severely that, and swelling was so much the brain matter was 
starting to come out.'

DNA 
from Teghan's blood was found on a wooden rod. The state expert 
testified that more than 30 items had evidence of the little girl's 
blood including underwear, pants, a sleeping bag and a pillow case.

A
 dentist told the court that bite marks on the child's body matched 
Richardson's teeth. Some were so severe that the flesh was torn off, the
 dentist said.

But 
Richardson's defense team argued that life in prison would be even more 
punishment, saying his crimes would make him a target for other inmates.

'There will never come a time when he can let his guard down,' attorney Mike Kinkosum said.

The little girl was in the care of her mother's boyfriend when she died in July 2010 of horrific injuries

Helen Reyes took the stand last month. She is charged with felony negligent child abuse causing serious bodily harm in connection with her daughter's death, according to ABC. She is free on bond and is yet to stand trial.

She told the court: 'I am here for Teghan, for my daughter ... to get justice for her, because that man murdered my baby.'

Jurors at the court in Smithfield appeared visibly upset when shown autopsy photos. The images were so graphic they caused the child's paternal grandfather to walk out of the court and her grandmother broke down in sobs.

Richardson's lawyer said his client was abused as a child and has mental health problems. The attorney described the four-year-old's death as an 'unbelievable tragedy' which the accused did not mean to happen.

According to wral.com, Police Deputy Matt DeSilva wept last week as he told the court that Teghan's injuries were 'the most horrifying thing I've ever seen done to a human being - especially a child'. 

On the witness stand on Tuesday, Helen Reyes' sister Maira said her family didn't approve of Richardson so her sister moved out with Teghan.

Authorities said the little girl was living with her mom and her boyfriend in a makeshift structure with no running water and no bathroom behind Richardson's grandparents' home.
