Scammers have allegedly hired IT experts to successfully win around 100 tickets to dine at chef Heston Blumenthal's pop-up restaurant in Melbourne. 

Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal's England-based restaurant The Fat Duck will temporarily be relocated to Melbourne for six months in 2015.

14,000 people will be able to enjoy the incredible culinary experience before the  restaurant at Crown Melbourne closes doors close forever.

Last month, Australians had the chance to put their name in an online ballot to win a table at his temporary Fat Duck restaurant and it appeared that a total of 89,179 people entered the ballot from all over the world.

However, at least 100 tickets were secured by  scalpers who entered hundreds of time using false names and their correct email address and phone numbers, according toFairfax Media.

Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal is closing his England restaurant temporarily and will instead open a temporary restaurant in Melbourne for six months from September 2015

Heston Blumenthal's unique sensory dishes have made his one of the world's most notorious chefs

The restaurant, The Fat Duck, will be opened at The Crown in Melbourne in Feburary 2015 for six months

It's reported that several financial professionals went to great lengths to scam the ballot system, each successfully winning around 40 of the incredibly rare restaurant reservations.

Although Crown is currently looking into their legal options, it’s claimed the applicants have not broken any law so could potentially be allowed to keep their tickets.

The 'tickets' are a hot item, with many of the people who left out desperate to experience Blumenthal's culinary mastery. 

The British chef's signature dishes infuse science with food and he is known for his kooky creations, including lickable wallpaper a la Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and bacon and egg ice cream. 

Already ads are appearing on online websites such as Gumtree from desperate foodies, offering up to $1000 to buy a ticket to dine at the restaurant – in addition the restaurant’s price of $525-a-head.

It’s believed the scam, which involved reserving seats with a pseudonym but correct contact details, was conducted by scalpers, hoping to increase their chances of winning the tickets and to then sell them at an extortionate price.

Other wealthy professionals allegedly employed the same method simply to ‘guarantee’ they would win reservations.

Fairfax media allege they are now gifting extra reservations to loved ones and wealthy clients, as well as selling them to colleagues. 

More than 250,000 applicants were unsuccessful in their attempt to reserve a table at the ‘pop-up’ restaurant which will run from The Crown in Melbourne for six months from February.

An IT expert in China was hired to work out a way to allow the user to enter the ballot multiple times, according to reports.

It’s alleged the loophole was found because the website did not record the applicants’ IP address.

The revelation comes after a hilarious fiasco when the celebrity chef tried to call the last 13 people to secure reservations to tell them about their success. 

He had very little success and he and the people around him have been filmed in hysterics as the well-intentioned phone calls went from bad to worse. 

The tenth person Mr Blumenthal called was the first to finally show a positive reaction. 

The first nine callers either hung up, did not answer, did not believe him or were just unimpressed with the offer. 

The first man the chef rang sounded entirely apathetic about the whole experience, explaining that he was not fussed and that his girlfriend has 'already won tickets anyway'.

One man was dubious and had a colourful response to the phone call.

‘You’re sh***ing me, aren’t you?’ he exclaims.

'I'm not sh***ing you at all, it's me, really,' a bemused Mr Blumenthal responds.

Fans of celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal took to social media to express their devastation at missing out on a table.

Those who were not lucky enough to get a place have expressed their bitter disappointment on Twitter but not without a sense of humour.

'#fatduckmelbourne ballots are out, sadly I did not get a reservation #sadduck. Guess Ill [sic] get $500 of #maccas [McDonald's] instead,' Julian Ridden tweeted.

Some who were knocked back were trying to negotiate their way onto others' tables

Those who were not lucky enough to get a place have expressed their bitter disappointment on Twitter but not without a sense of humour

'Missed out in the ballot for a reservation at #fatduckmelbourne,' James Caldwell tweeted

While Roslyn Grundy said: 'But Heston, I thought we were buddies?'

Some who were knocked back were trying to negotiate their way onto others' tables. 

Twitter user Candice offered up a friend as payment.

'Will trade @Dame_1978 for a table at the #fatduckmelbourne - No luck in the ballot & this looks too good to miss out,' she wrote.

But della wilson was more conventional in her method of compensation.

'Willing to pay if anyone has a fat duck reservation for Melbourne #fatduckmelbourne #gutted #alreadybeentodinnerbyheston,' she said.

Unsuccessful applicants who have been placed on the waiting list, only at their request, may still have a chance if there are any cancellations. 

Earlier this year, Fat Duck was named the third best restaurant in the world in an annual poll run by private jet lifestyle magazine Elite Traveler and Champagne Laurent-Perrier.

His London eatery, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal also placed 23rd in the top 100 eateries in the world list.
