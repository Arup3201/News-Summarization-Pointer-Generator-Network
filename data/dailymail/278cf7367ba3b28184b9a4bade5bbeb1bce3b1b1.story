A three-year-old girl spent two days 'fending for herself' while her mother lay dead on the floor of their home, an inquest has heard.

Avon saleswoman Sarah King, 40, collapsed after accidentally taking an overdose of prescription drugs.

Her body was found by boyfriend Gary Eastell, 39, who went round to her home in Mount Pleasant, near Macclesfield on May 8, when she failed to respond to his text messages.

The road in Mount Pleasant, near Macclesfield where the body of Sarah King was found. Her three-year-old daughter was found alone in the house with her dead mother

He found the little girl wandering around the property while her mother lay dead downstairs.

An inquest in Macclesfield heard the toddler may have been in the house alone with her mother's body for up to two days before she was found.

Mr Eastall told the inquest he discovered the door was unlocked and walked inside, where he spotted Ms King and called the emergency services.

He said: 'The home was a mess. But that was because she [the little girl] was fending for herself.

'She had got food in the room. Sarah was normally spotless.'

Ms King, who worked as an Avon saleswoman, had a long history of depression and had received psychiatric support for several bouts of the illness, dating back to the 1990s.

Ms King, who was separated from her child’s father, last spoke to friends and family on May 6 this year, two days before she was discovered.

Mr Eastell said: 'It was a Bank Holiday Monday. We had a nice day and walked by the canal. She seemed OK.

'That evening she sent me a text. She wanted me to tell her that I loved her.'

He said he decided to reply the next day and fell asleep. When he didn’t hear back, he initially thought she was just 'in a bad mood'.

Recording a verdict of misadventure, Cheshire's deputy coroner Jean Harkin said: 'I'm satisfied that she took the tablets. But I'm not satisfied she intended to end her life'

Ms King’s sister Hilary Coles and father Peter Austin had also been repeatedly trying to reach her.

Mr Austin, who was staying at Ms Coles’s house in Cornwall, called a friend to ask if they could check she was all right.

Mr Austin, from Congleton in Cheshire, said: 'At about 10.50pm, my mobile phone rang. It was the police telling me what they had found.'

A post-mortem examination revealed she had died from drugs toxicity linked to an anti-depressant.

The inquest heard how Ms King had also been experiencing financial problems and was worried about becoming homeless.

Detective Sergeant Jim Boulton, of Cheshire Police, said an investigation concluded there were no suspicious circumstances or third parties involved.

Recording a verdict of misadventure, Cheshire’s deputy coroner Jean Harkin said: 'I’m satisfied that she took the tablets. But I’m not satisfied she intended to end her life.

'On the balance of probability, she took the tablets, perhaps after an argument, meaning to frighten rather than take her life.'
