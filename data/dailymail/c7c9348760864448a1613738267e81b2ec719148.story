The world’s tallest climbing wall is opening in Nevada – on the side of a hotel.

Climbers can scale the 164ft structure on the Whitney Peak Hotel in Reno, US, which boasts incredible views of the city.

Once at the top, brave explorers will be rewarded with a panorama with the stunning snow-capped Sierra Nevada Mountains as a backdrop.

With different colour footholds on the building to indicate the route’s difficulty levels, the attraction will open its doors along with the new hotel on Saturday. 

The venue, which is located right next to the historic Reno Arch in the heart of downtown, boasts 150 modern-style rooms, and is a live music venue.

National and international artists, from touring rock bands to local talent, will be booked to play at the hotel over the summer.

The climbing wall, known as BaseCamp, also has 7,000-square-foot indoor bouldering park, and the only official 150metre speed wall in the US. 

Rob Hendricks, General Manager of the hotel, said: ‘We're excited to bring a new concept to downtown Reno. 

‘There are a lot of people who want to come to town for the outdoors, the dining, the live entertainment.’

Grand opening rates start at £77 per night for a room at the hotel.

BaseCamp is open to the public seven days per week, costing £10 for adults.
