A drunk 38-year-old man was shot dead by a homeowner in the early hours of New Year's Day after mistakenly believing he had arrived at his own house and breaking in, police have said.

William Bloomer was apparently celebrating the New Year at a party on the 800 block of Sawmill Road in Orange County, Texas, when his 'intoxicated' state caused him to start throwing up.

Minutes later, he 'vanished' from the house, situated north of Vidor, near Beaumont, and walked to the 1500 block of the road, where he reportedly forced his way into a home, mistaking it for his own.

The homeowner then confronted Mr Bloomer and fatally shot him with a handgun, before calling 911. When deputies arrived at the scene, they found the intruder dead from a gunshot wound.

According to 12 News, detectives believe that Mr Bloomer may have been so intoxicated that he thought he was breaking into his own house or that of someone he knew.

Witnesses confirmed accounts that the intruder had been drinking heavily, telling Fox 4 that they tried to clean up his vomit after he became sick and 'vanished' from the party shortly before 3am. 

No charges have yet been filed against the homeowner, who reportedly did not know Mr Bloomer.
