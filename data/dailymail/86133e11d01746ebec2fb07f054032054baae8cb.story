Balls were plucked out of thin air and hit onto the roof of Africa as the world's highest ever cricket match was played in a freezing ice crater near the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro  on Friday.

The match, featuring past and present stars of the game including England limited overs coach Ashley Giles and South African fast bowling legend Makhaya Ntini, took place not far from the 19,341ft (5,895m) Tanzanian summit known as the roof of Africa. 

A group of more than 30 players, official umpires and support crew trekked almost 20,000 feet to the top of the great African peak over eight days in a bid to surpass the record set in 2009 on Mount Everest.

The two teams, also including former England women's captain Clare Connor, current national representative Heather Knight and more from Australia, Canada, Kenya and South Africa, reached their target around dawn on Friday after slowly scaling the mountain to ensure they acclimatise properly.

They then rolled out a plastic pitch over the ice and set about playing a full Twenty20 match. 

'This is absolutely incredible! We are playing cricket on the summit of Africa!' former England spinner Giles tweeted from the summit. 

Due to the extreme elevation, balls travel further than they usually would so the organisers carried 24 spare ball in their packs, along with helmets, pads and bats, to ensure the game isn't cut short by a shortage of supplies.

'I am not underestimating how hard it will be because of the affect it will have on my body and my mind,' he said before setting off. 'But we should be able to pull each other through the challenge and then play a game.'

Just by being there, let alone playing a game of cricket, the teams risked acute mountain sickness, deadly pulmonary or cerebral oedema, but it's all for a good cause. 

For their efforts they aim to raise money that will go towards cancer research, African wildlife conservation charity Tusk Trust and building Rwanda`s first international cricket pitch. 

The match, once ratified by authorities, will break the 2009 Everest record by about 600 metres.   

The cricketers battled thin air in the high altitude, which made the ball travel further and put the players at serious risk of illness
