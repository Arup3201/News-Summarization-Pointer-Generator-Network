Since he rode his board to fame six months ago, Kama the surfing pig has discovered the benefits of living life as a professional beach-bum.

He spends his days on the sands of Oahu surrounded by adoring bikini-clad girls, all desperate to nuzzle up to and hug Hawaii's legendary piglet, despite the fact he now has his own little miss piggy.

Indeed, with his celebrity, sponsorship has flooded in from brands such as Local Motion, Safeway and even GoPro, who have created a unique harness for Kama to wear while he rides the half-pipes and checks the breaks.

Fans: Kama the surfing pig is a major attraction on the beaches on Oahu, Hawaii, and admirers are never far

He's so good that Costco gives him free surfboards and his devoted owner, Kai Holt, has promised never to cook him in an imu, a Hawaiian underground oven.

In February, his human, Kai, told Hawaii News Now that he knows Kama enjoys the surf.

'He really gets off on it. It seems like he has a good time out there,' said Holt.

'You know surfing is Hawaii's gift to the world. It's like true happiness, you know, that's what this guy does. Everywhere he goes he just makes people smile and laugh. He just brings joy to the world.'

Kama's surfing career started at the turn of the year when he stumbled into the Holt family's cabana at Bellows Beach.

They brought the little piggy home and realized his natural ability in the water when he fell into the family swimming pool in their backyard.

'I had no idea pigs could swim,' Holt said.

It wasn't long before Holt and his son Braiden took Kama to Sandy Beach and the four-legged pig was jumping onto Holt's standup paddle board.

'It's funny when there's a big wave and a bump coming and he launches into the air,' Braiden said.

'I think he's gonna drown, but he just pops right up out of the foam.'Â

Holt and Kama's bond is tight, they go everywhere together and sometimes even sleep in the same bed.

'As long as he lives, he's not gonna see a dinner plate, that's for sure,' Holt said.

'He wont see the inside of an imu.'

Kama gets his boards from Costco and his surfing clothes from Local Motion.

He even has his own Instagram account, kamathesurfingpig, where he keeps his more than 940 followers up-to-date on his adventures, especially with the ladies.
