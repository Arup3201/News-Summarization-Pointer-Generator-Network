For most children, a bump or scrape is a normal part of everyday life. But for Hugo Tornqvist, it can trigger a sequence of events that could kill him.

The two-year-old was born with  a rare genetic disorder that causes his skin to be very fragile and blister easily, at the slightest bump.

Called Junctional Herlitz Epidermolysis Bullosa, it is so serious that doctors wanted he wouldn't live to be more than eight months old.

Hugo Tornqvist, with father Magnus, was born with a rare genetic disorder that causes his skin to be very fragile and blister easily, at the slightest bump

When he was born, doctors predicted that Hugo (here with mother Hanna) now, two, wouldn't live past eight months

But Hugo, who lives just outside Karlskrona in Sweden with his mother Hanna and her 
partner Magnus, has defied the odds and is still fighting on.

The only exterior sign of Hugo's condition is his extremely sensitive skin, with the slightest bump causing it to peel off.

His entire body, both inside and out, is covered in sores and blisters.

The condition also has other unforeseen and serious implications, including respiratory problems that can cause Hugo's airways to close suddenly and without warning.

Last summer he had to be hospitalised 
due to severe breathing problems and on another occasion his eyes were 
totally swollen shut for three weeks.

But his body has battled back 
each time and, while at one point 70 per cent of his body was covered in 
blisters, today this is closer to 15 per cent. 

Hugo has also developed at a normal pace despite his poor immune system and the fact he has to be fed through a tube in his belly button due to scarring of the pharynx.

The family live in a specially adapted house where everything, including the floor of Hugo's bedroom, is carefully padded to avoid damage to his skin.

Meanwhile, he is not allowed to 
interact with children his own age and Hanna's other two children can 
only stay every other weekend to limit his exposure to childhood 
illnesses.

His mother said: 'We feel pleasure every morning Hugo opens his eyes but we only ever plan two days ahead.

'He never complains, but is a rewarding little guy.'

Hugo's disease is so rare that doctors have few answers to the family's questions.

His parents have also faced difficulties with their insurance company regarding the cost of Hugo's medical care.

His mother said: 'Now we have the full support but in the beginning it was terrible. I hope we have taken the fight for future families.'

Doctors are unable to say what Hugo's life expectancy is, as most people with the same condition rarely live past infancy.

His mother said: 'The only thing we can hope is that his breathing will be better, that the airways grow the older he gets.' 

And despite the hardships he faces, she says Hugo has taught her a lesson. She said: 'You can get one or the other in life, but it does not mean that you give up.

She adds: 'It's not bandages and gloves Hugo is wearing. It's sweatband and boxing gloves, because we're gonna beat the s*** out of this disease.'

Herlitz JEB causes widespread blistering of both the skin and the mucus membranes. Areas of the body affected by blistering and chronic ulcers include the eyes, inside the mouth and throat and the toes and neck.

Because the blistering also affects the mucous membranes, such as the moist lining of the mouth and digestive tract,  it can make it difficult to eat and digest food. As a result, many affected children have chronic malnutrition and slow growth.

Because of these complications, the outlook for children with Hugo's condition is very poor. Around 40 per cent of children with the condition die during their first year of life and almost all by the age of five.

Sepsis and respiratory failure (due to blistering and narrowing of the airways) are the most common causes of death.

Other complications of Herlitz JEB can include fusion of the fingers and toes, abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails, joint deformities that restrict movement, and hair loss (alopecia).
