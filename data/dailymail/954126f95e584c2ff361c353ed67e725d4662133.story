Tim Sherwood admits the boardroom ‘silence is deafening’ at Tottenham and fears he will be ousted from his job in the summer.

Chairman Daniel Levy was not at Chelsea on Saturday to see Spurs crashing to a 4-0 defeat which damaged their chances of returning to the Champions League, which seems to be Sherwood’s best way of somehow avoiding the axe.

Levy has made no attempt to refute the popular theory that Holland boss Louis van Gaal is primed to take over after the World Cup and, caught up in the emotion of losing heavily, Sherwood said: ‘The silence is deafening, isn’t it? It’s up to Daniel. I didn’t know if he was at the game or not. Maybe he was travelling.

Not good enough: Tim Sherwood was fuming after Tottenham's 4-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge

Not happy? Daniel Levy has been silent about the rumours involving Louis Van Gaal coming to the club

Chance: The Dutch manager has admitted a Premier League switch is appealing to him in the summer

‘One thing I guarantee is that no one 
cares more than me. I want the team to do very well and it hurts me when
 they don’t. I’m afraid I need people in that dressing room to be 
hurting like I am.’ Sherwood was appointed in December to replace Andre 
Villas-Boas and handed his first chance to manage at senior level with 
an 18-month contract, but appears resigned to becoming the eighth 
manager sacked by Levy in 13 years.

Sporting
 director Franco Baldini’s future also appears in jeopardy after Spurs 
lured former chief scout Ian Broomfield back to the club by hijacking a 
proposed switch from QPR’s scouting team to Arsenal’s.

Tottenham
 insist Baldini, who arrived only last year, and Broomfield will work in
 tandem but Levy seems determined to restructure again behind the scenes
 at White Hart Lane. Sherwood is understood to have not been consulted 
about Broomfield’s return.

Despite
 his inexperience, Sherwood has made it clear he has no desire to work 
as assistant to a new manager but hinted for the first time that he may 
be interested in a technical director’s role, a more powerful version of
 his previous position as technical coordinator with added 
responsibility for strategy through the club.

 ‘I feel I can do the No.1 job but I’d be no good as a No.2, I’m too opinionated. I wouldn’t want to do the job,’ said Sherwood.

‘There
 is a place for a technical director, someone who sees the club from 
bottom to top of the training field. There’s a definite place for that, 
otherwise you get no continuity and end up buying seven or 10 players 
every window and your turnover of players is too great.’

Chelsea players know how to win matches. There have been plenty of dives this season, the clearest from Ramires to preserve the Blues’ unbeaten home record, against West Brom. Others Jose Mourinho has admitted but still benefited from.

On Saturday evening, Samuel Eto’o didn’t dive but played very cleverly for the decisive penalty, which Michael Oliver awarded after 59 minutes at Stamford Bridge. Eto’o gets ahead of defenders and then slows his stride to draw contact.

This time, it was a small push from Younes Kaboul, which replays just about found. It was a soft penalty but not a wrong one from Oliver. He did very well to detect contact at full speed.

However, he then decided Kaboul had denied an obvious goalscoring chance, so he dismissed him. As Eto’o did not have control of the ball and was not heading directly towards goal, I don’t agree with the red. Spurs could well have the card overturned.

Not enough leaders: Sherwood casts an evil eye at midfielder Nabil Bentaleb at the end of the game

The
 win against Spurs extended Jose Mourinho’s unbeaten record in the 
Barclays Premier League at Stamford Bridge to 75 games. He has won 193 
points from a possible 225.

If
 there is friction behind the scenes, there was also friction on the 
touchline at Stamford Bridge, where Sherwood clashed angrily with 
Chelsea coach Steve Holland.

‘I
 thought his comments were a little bit patronising,’ said Sherwood. 
‘I’m not sure what he actually said, and to be honest I was in that kind
 of mood to blow up with anyone so no hard feelings.’

The
 Spurs boss was also unable to mask his feelings about his own players 
after what he described as another ‘gutless’ disintegration to go with 
6-0 and 5-1 defeats against Manchester City and a 5-0 defeat at home to 
Liverpool.

‘We lack something don’t we?’ said Sherwood when asked about his on-field leaders. ‘Capitulations are happening too often.

‘In
 adversity, when things go against us, that’s when we go missing. You 
either have that in you or you haven’t. We need to stand up and be 
counted sooner rather than later.’

Spurs performed well for 56 minutes until Jan Vertonghen’s mistake gifted Samuel Eto’o the first. Then they fell apart.

Younes
 Kaboul was sent off after conceding a penalty for Chelsea’s second and 
captain Michael Dawson pulled a hamstring and limped off. Defensive 
problems loom ahead of Sunday’s North London derby.

Dawson,
 Vlad Chiriches and Etienne Capoue, who can play at the back, are 
injured and Kaboul will be banned. The only senior centre-half available
 is Vertonghen, who says he wants out if Spurs do not make the Champions
 League and was responsible for sparking Saturday’s collapse and 
culpable in the third scored by Demba Ba.

Despondent: Aaron Lennon refused pushed Stefan Freund's hand away after the final whistle

Team spirit? The players were accused of not caring as much as their passionate boss

At
 the end, few Spurs players acknowledged their supporters and when coach
 Steffen Freund tried to usher Aaron Lennon towards them, Lennon pushed 
Freund’s arm away and stormed down the tunnel.

‘They
 should walk down there,’ said Sherwood.’I told them to go down there. 
You can understand their disappointment but those fans are disappointed 
too and those fans are second to none. It’s important our players 
acknowledge them.’

Mourinho
 defended Eto’o against accusations that he played to win Chelsea’s 
penalty and insisted football’s divers were not to be found at Stamford 
Bridge.

The Chelsea manager 
did not name Luis Suarez but there was a sly dig involved as he tackled 
the subject of deliberately trying to get opposing goalkeepers sent off.

‘We
 had big opportunity in the second minute of the game when other players
 with other shirts the players would go for a penalty and a red card for
 the keeper,’ said the Chelsea boss.

‘Eden
 Hazard doesn’t do that and he misses from a difficult angle. He tries 
to go away from the keeper, while other important players in this league
 they attack the keeper..

‘You know the kings of the penalites,’ said Mourinho. ‘You know where they are and they’re not here.’

Easy: Chelsea ran riot on Saturday

Instead,
 the Chelsea boss praised the predatory instincts of Eto’o, who is 33 
today,(MON) ‘Eto’o was brilliant,’ said Mourinho. ‘You can speak about 
Vertonghen’s mistake but it was only Vertonghen’s mistake because Eto’o 
is there. If Eto’o does not read the situation the defender or the 
goalkeeper will get the ball.

‘He’s
 not a 20 years old super-fast player like he was 10 years ago, so he 
needs to be close to the goal, he needs his feet in the box and he’s 
very intelligent in the way he moves.

Eto’o
 started against Spurs only because Fernando Torres was injured in the 
warm-up and is likely to miss at least two weeks as Chelsea sprint clear
 in the title race and attempt to reach the last eight of the Champions 
League.

Mourinho believes 
the Champions League will play a part in the title race, but believes 
both Manchester City and Manchester United can overturn their first leg 
defeats in Europe.

‘They 
lost at home, but can’t Manchester City win in Barcelona?’ said the 
Chelsea manager. ‘No? Barcelona lost to Valladollid and lost at home to 
Valencia. Why can’t they win? Why can’t Man United change that result 
against Olympiakos? I think they can. I think they’re going through. 
Arsenal at Bayern, can they win 2-0 and go to extra time? Difficult, 
probably the most difficult of the three but they can.’
