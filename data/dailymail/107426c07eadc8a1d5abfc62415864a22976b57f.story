Three mortuary managers could face prosecution after missing 10 chances to realise they had given the family of a paratrooper who died in custody the wrong body for burial.

Christopher Adler's relatives unwittingly buried the body of a 77-year-old woman in 2000 but 11 years later it was realised there had been a mistake.

The error was only discovered when the Nigerian family of Grace Kamara arrived to prepare her body for burial in November 2011.

Former paratrooper: Three managers at the mortuary where Christopher Alder's body was found - more than a decade after he was supposed to have been buried in Hull, now 'may have a case to answer'

Mr Alder, a 37-year-old Falklands war veteran, had died on the floor of a police station in the city in April 1998, with his arms handcuffed behind his back and his trousers around his ankles.

South Yorkshire Police carried out a 15-month investigation into the incident which was when they realised that Mrs Kamara's body was where Mr Alder's should have been.

The inquiry team ‘believe that three members of the management team of the mortuary between December 1, 1999 and November 4, 2011 may have a case to answer’, according to a summary.

The report says: ‘The investigation 
team have identified 10 occasions during this period of time when they 
had the opportunity to identify that the body purporting to be Grace 
Kamara was in fact Christopher Alder and working practices prevented 
this.

‘The Crown Prosecution Service must 
consider whether they have been “wilfully negligent” and whether the 
evidence is sufficient to pass the evidential test to support a charge 
and secure a successful prosecution for the criminal offence of 
misconduct in a public office.’

Mr Alder was punched during an argument outside a nightclub in his home city of Hull in 2008.

He was taken to hospital where he became hostile which has been put down to his head injury during previous investigations. He was discharged and police arrested him for breach of the peace.

Tragedy: Mr Alder, a 37-year-old Falklands war veteran, died on the floor of a police station in Hull in 1998

CCTV: By the time he arrived at Queen's Gardens police station, he was unconscious and his trousers were around his knees. He was left handcuffed on the floor while the four officers looked on and did nothing

By the time he arrived at Queen's Gardens police station he was unconscious and his trousers were around his knees.

In the custody suite he was left handcuffed on the floor while four officers looked on and did nothing.

They could allegedly be heard on CCTV footage making monkey noises as he lay dying for 11 minutes. They later claimed they thought he was ‘putting on an act’.

But a damning report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission found the men responsible of ‘unwitting racism’.

'Appalled': Mr Alder's sister Janet, 51, said she was angered by what appeared to have happened in the mortuary

It concluded that PC Matthew Barr, PC Neil Blakey, PC Nigel Dawson and Sergeant John Dunn - who all refused to co-operate with the IPCC investigation - were guilty of a ‘most serious neglect of duty’.

The officers were charged with manslaughter but acquitted at Teesside Crown Court in 2002 on the orders of the trial judge.

Mr Alder’s sister Janet, 51, said she was angered by what appeared to have happened in the mortuary, but added that if ‘working practices’ were to blame it raised the prospect of similar mistakes happening to other families.

‘I am absolutely appalled,’ she said. ‘If they’re saying it’s policy and procedures, it can’t have been the same people dealing with it all the time, so are they saying nobody did their job right?

‘I don’t believe that for one minute. If that’s the case how many times have they buried the wrong people? How can they be sure they haven’t done it before?

'If it’s down to policy and procedures there’s a good chance something like this has happened in the past and nobody knows about it.’

The mortuary was initially run by 
Hull City Council before being taken over by Hull and East Yorkshire 
Hospitals NHS Trust. Neither organisation would say when the transfer 
took place.

A spokesman for the trust said: ‘While this matter remains the subject of a criminal investigation the trust cannot comment.’

Trish
Dalby, the council’s corporate director for city services, said: ‘We 
understand the file has been forwarded to the CPS for their 
consideration and we are awaiting the outcome of their findings.’

South Yorkshire Police was asked to carry out the inquiry by Humberside Police because of the sensitive history of the case.

Huge blunder: He was arrested for a breach of the peace and taken to Queen's Gardens police station
