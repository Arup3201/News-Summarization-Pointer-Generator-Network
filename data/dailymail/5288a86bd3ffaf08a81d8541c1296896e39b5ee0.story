North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un is healthy - and ‘there is no doubt about it’, one of the country’s most senior officials has insisted.

The Communist regime’s ambassador to the United Kingdom became one of the first to offer a direct answer to increasing questions over the regime’s leader, who has not been seen since September 3.

The lack of public appearances by the usually widely-photographed Kim Jong-Un, 32, has led to speculation that he is either ill or even that he has been deposed.

A picture released  on 4 September 2014 shows  Kim Jong-un  and his wife Ri Sol-ju watching a performance by the Moranbong Band in Pyongyang. This was the last time the North Korean leader was seen in public

Speculation has been rife that Kim's younger sister Kim Yo-jong (left) is currently running the country

However speaking to the BBC, Ambassador Hyon Hak Bong, said: 'Our respected leader Comrade Kim Jong-Un is healthy, no doubt about it.'

But it is unlikely that the assurances  will bring an end to the flurry of rumors surrounding the whereabouts of the North Korean dictator.

In the five weeks since Mr Kim was last seen in the state media at a September 3 concert, he has missed several high-profile events that he normally attends.

An official documentary released late last month then made a single reference to Mr Kim's 'discomfort' and showed video footage from August of him overweight and limping. 

Speaking to the BBC, the North Korean ambassador devoted more time to questions about human rights abuses than to the whereabouts of the country's leader.

He said such allegations of abuses were false and driven by the United States as the country wants to bring down the regime in Pyongyang.

The ambassador took particular exception to the idea that there are labor camps in North Korea. He said there are no labor camps and there are no political prisoners.

He added that there are institutions which rectify people's behavior through labor but they do not amount to 'labor camps'.

Many analysts believe that while Mr Kim may have some health issues, he is probably not in serious trouble

North Koran defectors prepare to release balloons carrying leaflets condemning North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un and his government's policies. One theory is that the dictator has been toppled from power in a political coup and is currently languishing under house arrest - although there is little evidence to show this

He also said US missionary Kenneth Bae was being held in a 'reform institution', which was not the same as a labor camp.

Mr Bae was sentenced to 15 years' hard labor in 2013 after he was convicted by North Korea on charges of planning to overthrow the North Korean government.

The ambassador said in an email to the BBC: 'We have reform institutions where offenders sentenced to penalty of reform through labour by the relevant laws are held and educated through labour. 

His sister is in charge: Speculation has been rife that Kim's younger sister Kim Yo-jong is currently running the country

He is under house arrest: A more dramatic possibility is that the dictator has been toppled from power in a political coup and is languishing under house arrest

He 'hurt his leg': Thee have been rumors that Kim is out of action after injuring himself on a military visit or taking part in a military manoeuvre. There is no evidence to back this up, however.

He has gout:  Kim's poor health has been the focus of many theories. He is clearly unfit and was last seen limping and overweight. Official North Korean media have cited unspecified personal 'discomfort' as grounds for his absence from public view

He broke his ankle playing basketball: One of the more bizarre theories - spawned from an episode of Saturday Night Live - is that the cause of his mysterious absence is that he broke his ankle 'dunking over Michael Jordan'

He is ill due to diabetes, heavy smoking, endocrine problems, 'eating too much cheese': Various other health explanations have been put forward including a number of ailments

He's simply laying low: There is nothing particularly unusual about North Korean leaders stepping out the public eye for extended periods

'Some Western media interpret them as 'labour camps', but they are reform institutions.

'If I take an example, the place where American citizen Bae Jun Ho (Kenneth Bae) is being held is a reform institution.' 

But in February the United Nations found  that there were widespread and serious abuses of human rights to be taking place in North Korea.

In a recent online post titled 'North Korea Misinformation Bingo', Adam Cathcart, a University of Leeds history lecturer, suggested that the absence of Kim Jong-Un could be North Korea's attempt to change the subject from its human rights abuse

But he later added that there are lots of rumors floating around, and 'most of them are probably wrong'.

Many analysts believe that while Kim may have some health issues, he is probably not in serious trouble. But his possible ill-health has led to speculation.  

Other commentators have noted that there is nothing particularly unusual about North Korean leaders laying low for extended periods. 

Kim's late father, Kim Jong Il, who was no fan of the limelight in his later years, would disappear at times. 

Kim Jong-Un, who seems to genuinely like being at the center of things, took off without a word for three weeks in 2012.  

Other reports have suggested from a range of ailments including  diabetes, a brain hemorrhage, a heart ailment, a leg injury that required surgery from a French doctor and even a cheese addiction that made his unwell.

'Within North Korea, the people feel Kim's presence even when he is absent,' Scott Snyder, a Korea expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a recent blog post.

'Externally, North Korean propaganda has made Kim's presence so critical that international media regard his absence as disquieting, even ... without supporting indicators of instability or upset in Pyongyang.'

Kim's disappearance from the public eye 'does not appear likely to shake the regime, but it reveals the vulnerabilities the regime faces', Snyder said.

Last week, Saturday Night Live addressed the North Korean dictator's mysterious disappearance, with a bizarre skit in which the cast mocked his claims that he is still in power but just 'hurt his leg'.

Bobby Moynihan, playing Kim, screams at a room full of soldiers: 'I broke my ankle dunking Michael Jordan! The movie Space Jam is about me, we all know that!' 

North Korea's ambassador to the UK told the BBC that the country's 32-year-old leader is well, despite having been absent from public view for more than 38 days

One of the more bizarre theories - spawned from an episode of Saturday Night Live (pictured) - is that the cause of his mysterious absence is that he broke his ankle 'dunking over Michael Jordan'
