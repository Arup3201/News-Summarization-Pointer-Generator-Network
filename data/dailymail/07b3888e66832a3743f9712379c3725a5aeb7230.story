English cricket received another boost on Sunday when Steven Finn was called up to the squad for Thursday’s fourth Investec Test against India in Manchester less than eight months after he was deemed ‘unselectable’ and sent home from the Ashes tour.

Finn, who has not played a Test since he was all-but ignored by captain Alastair Cook on the final morning at Trent Bridge against Australia in July 2013, replaces Liam Plunkett in the 13-man party after the Yorkshire seamer pulled out with an injury to his left ankle.

And with the Old Trafford surface expected to offer enough bounce to keep the taller bowlers interested, the 6ft 7in Finn could walk straight back into the side in place of Chris Jordan, who went wicketless during England’s otherwise triumphant victory last week’s third Test in Southampton and struggled with his control.

Flying Finn: The Middlesex fast bowler will come in to the England squad for Liam Plunkett

Angus Fraser, Finn’s director of cricket at Middlesex and an England selector, told Sportsmail: ‘The time is right. He’s come through every challenge placed in front of him this season. There are obviously no guarantees of anything and he’ll be nervous. But he should take a lot of confidence from his selection.’

It was painful to watch Finn’s decline from the fearsome fast bowler with 90 wickets in 23 Tests into the disconsolate figure bowling in the nets in Australia as he tried to reconstruct his action. Recently he said: ‘It was horrible, standing at the back of my mark thinking, “Where is this going to go?”’ So alien did the ball feel, he even claimed to have lost sensation in his fingertips.

His downward spiral had begun in 2012, when South Africa’s captain Graeme Smith opportunistically objected to Finn’s habit of dislodging the bails with his right knee at the point of delivery. In a bid to remedy the problem, Finn went wide of the stumps — and gradually found his technique unravelling. An attempt to wean him on to a shorter run-up did not help either.

But some sensitive remedial work with Middlesex assistant coach Richard Johnson, himself a former Test bowler, helped restore Finn’s confidence. And his 44 wickets this season in Division One of the County Championship have come at a respectable 29 runs each.

Johnson said: ‘He’s obviously gone through a hell of a lot in the last few months but he’s now at a stage where he’s bowling well and confident in himself. Given an opportunity, I think he’ll do well. In his own head, he’s back to bowling how he wants to bowl.’

Finn received the call on Sunday from national selector James Whitaker after heading down to Exeter to be with his girlfriend and prepare for a one-day game in Taunton for England Lions. But he has headed back to London to collect his Test kit before joining up with the full squad in Manchester.

Fraser said: ‘I spoke to him and he’s really excited and looking forward to it. I’m very proud of both him and Richard Johnson. I’ve just let them get on with it and they’ve worked very well together. 

Missing out: Liam Plunkett has been withdrawn from the England squad because of an ankle injury

The hope now in the England dressing-room is that the Old Trafford pitch serves up the kind of pace and bounce which — before the square was rotated 90 degrees — used to be popular with Steve Harmison.

Fraser was on Sunday poring over footage from Lancashire’s Twenty20 quarter-final in Manchester against Glamorgan on Saturday, and was especially pleased to see a match-changing triple-wicket maiden from home seamer Jordan Clark. ‘The pitch looked like it had a bit of bounce in it,’ he said.

The Indians were impressed with Finn when England visited for a one-day tour at the end of 2011, even though they lost 5-0, and again when he and Jimmy Anderson bowled Cook’s team to victory in the third Test at Kolkata in December 2012. And he has enjoyed success in the past against Ajinkya Rahane, who is averaging 54 in the current series.

Finn is only 25, still a few years away from his fast-bowling peak. If, after his traumatic winter, he’s impatient to scale it more quickly than that, no-one will be blaming him.
