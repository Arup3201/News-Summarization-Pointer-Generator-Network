After a 17-hour air and ground search, an 18-year-old Michigan girl missing since Thursday has been found alive and delivered to police.

Hayley Turner was 40 miles from home when she was seen jumping out of a moving vehicle in Ecorse by an unidentified woman.

Details on the woman's condition weren't released, but Ecorse police Cpl. Chris Trevino said she 
was able to talk to police, saying she had been abducted and at one 
point had been 'hooded.'

Questions: It's unclear what transpired between the time Hayley Turner (left) went missing and her discovery 17 hours later 40 miles from home

Turner was on the phone with a friend saying she had come across a man in a ditch and was going to check on him when he produced a gun and the call was disconnected

Trevino said she was upset and he described her
 as not very talkative.

Sheriff's Detective Sgt. Jeff Pauli told the Free Press on Saturday 
that the woman was 'home and resting comfortably' as authorities 
continue to look for a suspect.

'We're investigating all facts, all possibilities,' he said. 'We have not arrived at a conclusion.'

A homeowner found her sitting near West Outer Drive and East 19th Street, shirtless around 2:30pm today.

According to Click on Detroit, Turner gave the homeowner her mother's cell phone number before the homeowner drove her to the Ecorse Police Department.

Police believed Turner may have been abducted when she disappeared after a phone conversations with a friend that was cut off.

Turner had gone to a local video store to rent some movies and spoke to her friend as she headed home around 10pm.

A rental receipt would show that the Notre Dame Academy student had rented Muppets Most Wanted and Divergent.

Employees would later tell the authorities that she was happy and smiling.

On her drive home, she told her friend that she had spotted a man lying in a ditch and that she was going to check on him.

In an emotional press conference, mother Christy Turner begged for any word of her daughter's whereabouts

'Seconds later, Hayley told her friend "he has a gun" and the phone was disconnected,' Monroe County Sheriff Dale Malone related to reporters at a news conference.

According to Bedford Now, the unidentified friend called her father, who sped to the scene only to find his daughter's car running but empty, her iPad missing but her wallet still there.

The ensuing search utilized dogs, helicopters, and even enlisted FBI agents.

A potential suspect could be a white male described in a call to authorities Friday morning.

'The male was described as a white male, 18-24 years old, wearing brown khaki shorts and a blue shirt. The female was described as 18-24 with a red shirt, long, black, tight-fitting pants and shoulder-length dark hair. This is very similar to Hayleyâ€™s description and what she was last seen wearing,' Malone told reporters.

As she waited for word, mother Christy Turner was understandably desperate for information, pleading with the public for any word of her daughter's whereabouts.

'Hayley, please call. Call anybody,' Turner begged during a press conference. 'We miss you. We want you home.'

She was taken to a local hospital, reportedly with minor injuries, but police declined to say whether she'd been assaulted.

Turner's family said the girl had been struggling with some emotional issues this year.
