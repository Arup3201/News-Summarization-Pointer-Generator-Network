The teenage daughter of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio opened up about her struggle with depression and addiction as she received an award for speaking out about her experiences.

Chiara de Blasio described how 'life didn't seem worthwhile' as she battled depression and addiction while her father ran for mayor last year.

She was honored with an award from Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius yesterday for speaking publicly about her recovery.

Ms de Blasio, a student at Santa Clara University, posted a YouTube video on Christmas 
Eve in which she described how she had struggled with depression and 
anxiety most of her life and that she turned to substances in order to 
cope.

She received a standing ovation as she walked on stage to receive the award at the event in Maryland, the New York Daily News reported.

Speaking at the event, held to promote National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day, Ms de Blasio said: 'One year ago, I was lost, confused and overpowered by depression, anxiety, addiction and fear', The Wall Street Journal reported.

'One year ago, life didn't seem worthwhile. One year later, here I am and that is nothing other than a miracle.'

In essay published by xoJane, an online magazine for women, hours before the ceremony, Ms de Blasio describes how she was 'miserable' for her 'entire adolescence' and believes she was 'born with the disease of addiction'.

She writes: 'I had an amazing, unconditionally loving and unbroken family.

At the event yesterday, Ms de Blasio thanked her parents and her 16-year-old brother for their support, along with mental health professionals for helping her 'see that life is worth living'

'I went to good schools. I lived in a beautiful neighborhood. So why, then, did I always feel empty?

'I was surrounded by love, but I always felt less-than, out-of-place, restless, irritable and discontent.'

She goes on to describe how she focuses each day on 'progress' and says: 'I know that fighting my depression, anxiety and addiction will be a lifelong battle.

'But today, it is one that Iâ€™m willing to fight.'

Ms de Blasio's online video was posted just a few days before her father was sworn into office on January 1.

At the time Mr de Blasio said he was proud of his daughter for posting the video, adding that he and his wife paid for its production.

He said: 'We're so proud of our daughter. It took courage. It took strength.

'It was an incredibly genuine explanation in her own words of what she confronted and how she overcame it.'
