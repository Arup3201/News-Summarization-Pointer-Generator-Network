Burnley are back in the big time after Sean Dyche led them to promotion to the Premier League last season - and one tiny fan foresaw the return.

Morgan Shapland was just five weeks old when Burnley were relegated in 2010 and he was pictured in a crib with the sign 'We'll Be Back' next to him.

The four-year-old was in Burnley's official programme at the time but now he can look forward to watching Burnley take on Chelsea in the Premier League opener at Turf Moor on Monday. 

Prediction: Then five-week-wold Morgan Shapland was pictured in 2010 when Burnley were relegated

Now: The four-year-old was pictured in the programme at the time and he is now an avid supporter

Excitement: Morgan Shapland cannot wait to see Burnley's Premier League opener with Chelsea at Turf Moor

Then and now: Morgan Shapland points to the photo of him as a five-week-old baby in the Burnley programme

He has become an avid Burnley follower and has not missed a home fixture since their pre-season friendly with Sparta Rotterdam at the beginning of the last campaign.

And he will experience Premier League football for the first time as Burnley take on Jose Mourinho's men next week.

His father, Chris, told Cascade News: 'It has been all he has been talking about for weeks - he absolutely loves it.

'He's even been to all of the friendlies as well, which has been good because we're usually quite high up in the Jimmy McIlroy Stand.

'Danny (Ings) is his favourite (player). He has his name on the back of his shirt and just loves him.; 

Despair: Burnley were relegated from the Premier League after only on season in the top flight in 2010

Elation: Manager Sean Dyche led Burnley tp promotion the Premier League from the Championship in 2014
