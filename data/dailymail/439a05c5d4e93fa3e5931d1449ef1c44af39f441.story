Former New york Mayor Rudy Giuliani joined Jewish and disabled protestors camped outside the New York Metropolitan Opera at the premiere of 'The Death of Klinghoffer' last week which tells the story of four Palestinian hijackers who brought terror to the Achille Lauro cruise ship in the Mediterranean in 1985.

The slick production has been criticized for glamorising terrorism in its portrayal of the infamous atrocity in which the terrorists murdered an elderly disabled American Jewish passenger, Leon Klinghoffer in full view of many of the American and British passengers on board.

They then threw his blood-stained body - still in his wheelchair - overboard.

Infamy: The hijacking of the notorious 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro has been made into an opera that sparked protests when it was staged at the New York Metropolitan Opera last week

Anger: The slick production has been criticized for glamorising terrorism in its portrayal of the infamous atrocity in which the terrorists executed an elderly disabled American Jewish passenger, Leon Klinghoffer in full view of the passengers on board. They then threw his body - still in his wheelchair - overboard

The hijackers threatened to execute more passengers if their demands to release 50 Palestinian terrorists held in Israeli jails were not met.

But what the opera fails to explain is one of the true motives behind the Achille Lauro attack - and why one prisoner in particular was of key significance.

Abu Abbas, the murderous leader of the Palestinian Liberation Front - the terror group behind the hijacking - was determined to make Israel release Samir Kuntar. His was the only name specified by the hijackers.

Kuntar, a Lebanese citizen and a friend of Abbas, had been jailed five years earlier by the Israelis for one of the most horrendous and notorious acts in Israel's history.

Kuntar and an accomplice launched an attempted kidnapping of a Jewish family in Israel which resulted in the horrific deaths of a young father and two young daughters. 

Wife and mother, Smadar Haran Kaiser, was the only survivor after the raid on the fateful night of April 22, 1979, in Nahariya, in northern Israel, close to the Lebanese border.

Smadar wrote in 2003: 'It was a murder of unimaginable cruelty, crueler even than the murder of Leon Klinghoffer, the American tourist who was shot on the Achille Lauro and dumped overboard in his wheelchair.'

When the family heard the men approaching their apartment, Smadar grabbed her two-year-old daughter, Yael, and managed to hide with her in a ceiling loft space.

Her 31-year-old husband, Danny, and her elder daughter Einat, four, tried to run to an underground shelter but were caught by the intruders.

The terrorists, who had already killed a policeman en route from the beach where they had landed in an inflatable dinghy, began searching for mother and daughter.

Horror: Danny, Einat and Yael Haran were killed in a botched kidnapping in Nahariya, Israel, at the hands of  terrorists in 1979. The killings are still seen as one of the worst episodes in the country's history

Dirty deal: Abu Abbas, the murderous leader of the Palestinian Liberation Front - the terror group behind the Achille Lauro hijacking - was determined to make Israel release Samir Kuntar - who killed the family

Survivor: Smadar Haran Kaiser, Danny's wife and mother to the two girls, told MailOnline that she was upset that the Death of Klinghoffer does not reference in any way the horror her family endured

In a bid to avoid being caught, Smadar hushed Yael's cries by putting her hand over her terrified little girl's mouth and the attackers failed to locate them overhead. 

Danny and Einat were taken away by Kuntar to the beach. But the alarm had been raised and the police were in hot pursuit. Kuntar abandoned any hope of returning with hostages.

According to eyewitnesses, Danny was shot in front of Einat - so the last thing she would see was her father being murdered. Then Kuntar killer her by smashing her skull against a rock with a rifle butt.

The postscript to the awful events of that night was no less shocking.

In Smadar's own words: 'By the time we were rescued from the crawl space, hours later, Yael, too, was dead. In trying to save all our lives, I had smothered her.'

The next day Abu Abbas, who planned the attack with Kuntar - who was caught that night - said it had been done 'to protest the signing of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty at Camp David' seven months earlier.

Writing in the Washington Post in 2003, Smadar said: 'Kuntar's mission against my family, which never made world headlines, was also masterminded by Abu Abbas. 

'And my wish now is that this terrorist leader should be prosecuted in the United States, so that the world may know of all his terrorist acts, not the least of which is what he did to my family.'

Her pleas went unheeded. 

Despite his violent terrorist past and the efforts of many intelligence agencies to apprehend him, Abu Abbas was never brought to account for his many acts of terrorism. 

As part of the 1993 Oslo Accords treaty between Israel and the Palestinians, he was controversially allowed to move freely around the Middle East as a representative of the Palestine National Council. 

He spent some years in Gaza before moving to Iraq where he reportedly became the conduit through which Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein – a sworn enemy of Israel – paid $25,000 bounties to the family of each Palestinian suicide bomber who killed Israelis.

Brutal: Kuntar, seen here being arrested after the murders, shot Danny dead on a beach and then killed Einat by smashing her head against a rock with a rifle butt. Meanwhile, Smadar had tragically smothered Yael to death as she held her hand over her mouth to stifle the girl's screams as they hid in a crawl space in their home

Senseless: Kuntar and his accomplice had landed on the Israeli beach with the aim of kidnapping the family in an operation masterminded by Abu Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Front

Haunted: Evidence from the pathologist's report showing that Einat's brain tissue was found on the rifle butt

Abbas was captured by US forces in Iraq in 2003 and reportedly died a year later, while still in custody, of natural causes.

Despite an outcry in Israel against the decision, Kuntar was released from prison five years later in 2008, returning to a hero's welcome in Lebanon - where he was met at the airport by both the Lebanese president and prime minister - while, not to be outdone, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad granted him the Syrian Order of Merit. He remains a free man.

The awful events of that 1979 night still shock more than 35 years later, but are apparently not presented nor referenced in any way in 'The Death of Klinghoffer', to the dismay of Smadar.

The key, sickening event that specifically inspired the hijacking - and might have put it into proper even more grotesque context – is absent from the production.

This week, Smadar, now in her 60s, still living in Naharia, and who some years ago re-married and has two adult daughters from her second marriage, spoke to MailOnline. 

Smadar, who is now a clinical social worker who cares for Jewish and Arab children in her mixed community in the Galilee, has not seen 'The Death of Klinghoffer'.

But she expresses concern at the glaring omission of the truly horrific catalyst to the story – her story - which they fail to mention at any point.

'These days I see that everybody is trying to simplify everything without making people have to think too much,' Smadar said. 'They take anything that is controversial, or that will grab attention, and portray everything as black and white... like in the news coverage connected to the very complicated issue between us [Israelis] and the people around us, including the Palestinians.'

'The opera appears to be yet another easy way to show things in a superficial way; simplified, very basic, without looking at the background in enough depth. It surprises me that they’re doing an opera about it. I ask myself, “What is the connection to opera?” It's very strange.'

'I saw the demonstrations on the news,' she continues. 'I ask myself if it has an anti-Semitic message, anti-Jewish, or anti-Israeli, or if we're over-sensitive.' 

She pauses then wonders out loud: 'I just don't know, but it might be that the bigger picture might have ruined their story.'

Outrage: Abu Abass, left, was never brought to justice and Samir Kuntar, right, was freed in 2008 

She offers a final thought for those considering enjoying a night at the opera by taking in 'The Death of Klinghoffer'.

'They need to understand that Samir Kuntar, the one that was supposed to be released [by the hijacking of the Achille Lauro], was a cold-blooded murderer that acted against an innocent family at night. There's nothing heroic, or brave about that.'
