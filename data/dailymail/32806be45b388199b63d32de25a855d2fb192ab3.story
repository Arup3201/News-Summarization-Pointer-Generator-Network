Having the top scorer in the league is normally a good indicator who will win promotion at the end of the season.

And in Daryl Murphy Ipswich have the Championship’s most lethal marksman and his double at Griffin Park took his tally to 16 this season and cemented Mick McCarthy’s side in the automatic promotion places.

Murphy’s goals, coupled with this impressive win over a high-flying Brentford side, shows why Ipswich should be taken seriously as promotion candidates.

But with the transfer window opening next week, McCarthy says is not worried about anyone trying to prise his top scorer away from Portman Road

McCarthy said: ‘At the moment we are in the top two of the league and he is top scorer. If someone comes in and offers bonkers money then it will upset the apple cart and I will have to deal with it.

‘We turned down £7.5millon for David McGoldrick and £3.5m for Tyrone Mings in the past. The owner Marcus (Evans) has a chunk of dough, and that is the support he gives me meaning I don’t have to sell my best players, and why would I when we are towards the top of the league?’

It was Murphy who got Ipswich off the perfect start with the opening goal after just 19 seconds.

Brentford keeper David Button’s clearance only managed to find Teddy Bishop who headed the ball out to Paul Anderson on the right and he crossed for Murphy who found space in the middle of the penalty area and fired into the bottom corner.

And Ipswich - who have now lost just once in the last 19 games - doubled their lead through Murphy on 21 minutes.

The Republic of Ireland striker latched onto a long ball from Jonathan Parr and shrugged off the challenge of Tony Craig before rounding Button and slotting the ball into an empty net.

It was three on the half hour when Murphy played the ball out to Jay Tabb who crossed for Paul Anderson who was able to bundle the ball over the line from close range. 

Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy can afford a smile as his team showed they are real promotion candidates

Brentford have been one of the surprise packages in the Championship this season, but they were caught cold by Ipswich’s clinical finishing.

But the home side did not give up and did get on the scoresheet with 10 minutes remaining when substitute Sam Saunders’ deflected shot looped over Bartosz Bialkowski and into the far corner.

But Ipswich centre back Tommy Smith replied straight away when he bent the ball into the top corner from 10 yards.

The late flurry of goals was completed when Saunders bundled the ball over the line for a second for Brentford but it was too late to stop the points heading back to East Anglia.

McCarthy added: ‘The league is so tough and we have to be ruthless and relentless as the league is.

‘Bournemouth are the best team in the league in my view. But there are plenty of other sides in contention, but results don’t lie, we have the points and we have to keep that going.’

For Brentford it was only their third home defeat this calendar year and boss Mark Warburton rued his side’s defending.

He said: ‘You can’t go three down to teams of that quality and give yourself a mountain to climb.

‘We weren’t muscled out of it but we were uncharacteristically sloppy. We were a little bit tentative and maybe that first minute goal unnerved a couple of our players.’
