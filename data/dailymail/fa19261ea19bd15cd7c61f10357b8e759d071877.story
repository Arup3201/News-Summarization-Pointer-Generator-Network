A script for the last episode of popular TV show Downton Abbey was stolen after a hacker accessed the writer's email account.

The cyber thief, known was 'Guccifer', apparently managed to download the script for the final episode of the fourth season of the ITV show after getting into Julian Fellowes' private email.

It means the hacker, who has also targeted George W Bush and Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein, was in possession of the script six months before it was aired on television. 

Hacked: Writer Julian Fellowes' email account was hacked and the Downton series four finale script stolen

Over the last year, it has been reported the hacker is responsible for a number of high-level security breaches and has accessed email and Facebook accounts of senior US officials and senators. 

In February 2013, it was claimed the hacker was responsible for accessing the emails of Dorothy Bush Koch, sister of George W Bush, and releasing family photos.

The Independent reports his British targets also include the former Attorney General, Baroness Scotland and the City financier Sir Francis Brooke.

As well as Government officials, Guccifer has also managed to access Candace Bushnell's email and Twitter account and released the first 50 pages of the unpublished novel written by the Sex and the City author and also hacked comedian Steve Martin.

Actor Rupert Everett, BBC broadcaster Jeremy Paxman and Sir Francis Brooke have also been hacked by the outlaw.

It is believed most of the victims were targeted after Guccifer managed to steal 900 contact names from journalist Tina Brown who is the editor of The Daily Beast.

By using publically-available information about his targets, the hacker guesses password security questions to gain access to email accounts. 

Using Wikipedia pages of prospective victims, he obtained the names of a target’s relatives, and even referred to a list containing the most popular names for dogs and cats.

Website The Smoking Gun reported it has recently been handed documents that show Guccifer obtained private messages, photos and phone records as well as credit card and bank statements. 

The website says Guccifer didn’t offer a motive for his activities and handed over his archive of thousands of documents without revealing his identity ‘just in case I am busted.’

He has also got the mobile phone numbers of Hollywood star Robert Redford as well as email addresses for Nicole Kidman and Leonardo DiCaprio.

The MailOnline has approached Lord Fellowes and Baroness Scotland for comment.
