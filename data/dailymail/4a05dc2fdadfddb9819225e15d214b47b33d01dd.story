A gorilla born just five days ago at a zoo in Minnesota has died after 'complications' feeding him.

The male baby - who had not been named - seemed healthy and strong when he was born last Wednesday at Como Zoo in St Paul.

But the tiny primate fell ill and was dead less than a week later - after he apparently didn't feed properly from his mother.

Zookeepers said that despite seeming to have a strong maternal instinct straight away, new mother Alice would cradle him out of sight - raising the prospect that she wasn't feeding him.

Not long for this world: The tiny baby, pictured above the day he was born, died Monday. He was five days old

Motherly love: The baby, pictured above with his mother, Alice, could have died due to 'complication' feeding, zookeepers said

In a statement posted Monday, zoo officials said Alice showed all the signs of a strong maternal bond with her son, but that they kept their distances to minimize stress on the new mother. 

They said: 'It is with a very heavy heart that we announce the passing of the baby gorilla that was born at Como Zoo to first-time mother Alice on Wednesday, November 19.

'The baby had appeared as if he was doing well through Saturday evening. He had a strong grip and was vocal. Alice was showing positive signs of maternal instinct, had been observed nursing and cradling the baby.

'Despite best efforts to monitor and record the baby’s food intake, many times Alice would cradle her baby to her chest with her back towards the observing zookeepers making it difficult to determine when and if nursing was indeed taking place.

Cradled: Alice had a strong maternal bond, officials said. But they could not be sure whether he was properly fed because Alice would cradle him while turning away from watching zookeepers

'To prevent undue stress on new mothers, and allow them the necessary time to bond with their baby, it is imperative that zoo staff and veterinarians not intervene unless absolutely necessary.

'On Sunday morning it was apparent that the baby was weak and his health failing. While the intervention process was happening the baby was set down by Alice and the zookeepers were able to retrieve him without the need to immobilize Alice.

'Resuscitation efforts on the infant were quickly preformed but were unsuccessful.'

Hearts soared when the baby was born Wednesday, as video footage showed the 4lbs baby in his mother's arms.

The newborn was the first of his kind to be born at the zoo in its 55-year history of gorilla care and conservation. 

Troubles: Vets tried to resuscitate the baby after they realized he was likely to do - but their efforts were unsuccessful 

A gorilla mother is very protective of her babies and will carry them on her chest for the first three months - making it difficult to interfere.

The babies then ride on their mother's back at around six months old and begin playing on the ground close by.

More than a quarter of male gorilla babies survive for less than a year after being born in captivity, figures show. The mortality rate in the wild is even worse.

Some 26 per cent of males born since 1980, and 20 per cent of females, did not make it to their first birthday, according to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums

Figures from the wild peg death rates at around 42 per cent.
