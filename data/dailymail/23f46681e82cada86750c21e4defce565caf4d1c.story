Researchers in Melbourne could be on the verge of a medical breakthrough after pinpointing three types of stem cells in umbilical cord blood, which could be the key to preventing cerebral palsy.

As part of a trial to prevent the disorder, babies in Victoria will be given back their own umbilical blood, reported The Herald Sun.

Cerebral palsy is a physical condition affecting posture and movement, due to damage to the developing brain during pregnancy or shortly after birth.

New hope: A trail will see babies in Victoria given back their own umbilical blood in a bid to prevent the cerebral palsy

One Australian child every 15 hours is born with cerebral palsy according to Cerebrapalsy.org.au.

Often caused by oxygen deprivation around the time of birth, about 700 Australian babies are born with cerebral palsy each year, making it the most common childhood physical disability.

Researchers at the Monash Institute of Medical Research found that giving back umbilical cord blood to newborns within 12 hours of birth could prevent the likelihood of birth asphyxia, which causes brain damage.

During the Annual Congress of the Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand, scientist Courtney McDonald revealed researchers were in the process of determining the link between umbilical cord blood and brain repair.

'Cord blood works, but we want to know what’s the best cord blood to give back,' Dr McDonald said.

'These particular cells can actually stop the inflammation which causes damage. They can help the baby’s own brain repair itself, and help these blood vessels become stronger.'

The Ritchie Centre's research is focused on three types of stem cell and their characteristics: anti-inflammatory T-regulatory cells, Endothelial Progenitor cells, which stimulate blood flow to injured areas and the brain-repairing Mesenchymal stem cells.

Part of the team's research involved taking umbilical cord blood from lambs and then isolating the specific stem cells.

Once this was done, the stem cells were then injected back into the animals 12 hours from the time of injury, Dr McDonald said.

The results from the study will form the basis of a national human clinical trial, which will see babies at risk of cerebral palsy given the umbilical cord blood in the first few days after birth.

'The results that are coming out of our studies and the clinical trials overseas are so promising. It’s going to happen. It has so much potential,' Dr McDonald said.

The trial will be led by Professor Euan Wallace and Associate Professor Michael Fahey.

In 2012, a world-first trial at Monash Medical Centre saw pregnant women whose babies were not developing normally, given an antioxidant.

Doctors believed this was capable of stopping their babies from suffering brain damage in the womb and developing cerebral palsy, reported The Age.

Research centres around the world are testing the success of stem cell therapies.

In South Korea, human clinical trials appear promising with children aged between six months and 10 years old, who received donated cord blood together with other rehabilitation therapies, showing improvements in cognitive function and motor skills.
