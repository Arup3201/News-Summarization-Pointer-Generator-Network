Police have spent thousands of pounds sending suspected criminals home from the cells in taxis, it can be revealed today.

Six forces across the country booked cabs for people after they were released while two others admitted getting police officers to drive them home.

The figures sparked accusations that suspected are being pampered when they are booked into custody after being arrested on suspicion of criminal wrongdoing.

Officials claimed they had a duty of care to get 'criminals' home safely if they are released late at night rather than have them roaming the streets.

Separately. the figures revealed that police forces spent £17million on fleets of hire cars last year for occasions when their own unmarked cars were unavailable.

Scotland Yard was by far the biggest spender in the last financial year - blowing £9.2million on vehicles that included BMW, Audi, Mercedes and Alfa Romeo cars.

The force spent £5.9million hiring 
cars during the Olympics alone, according to figures released to the 
MailOnline under the Freedom of Information Act.

Thames Valley Police were the next biggest spenders and shelled out £965,945 on hired vehicles.

Police
 in Dorset, Durham, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Suffolk and North Wales 
all admitted using a slice of their hire car budget to pay taxi companies to drive 
suspects home.

In total, 
they said they spent £13,592 on cabs for at least 828 suspects, with 
North Wales Police blowing £4,151 on 318 journeys.

All figures are for the 2012-13 financial year

Northamptonshire Police paid £3,143 on taxis to drive 336 people home from the cells.

Kent and South Wales Police also admitted getting their own officers to drive people home.

Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance said that police should not be running a taxi service.

'Taxpayers will be left wondering why one earth they are paying for a cab ride home for those who have been nicked,' he said.

'Unless there is a clear danger to someone’s welfare or an obvious mistake in the arrest then there is no need for police forces to cough up for rides.

'Ultimately the police should be able to use their digression but taxpayers would rather see coppers tackling crime, not acting as a taxi service.'

A spokesman for Northamptonshire Police said they only use taxis as a 'last resort'.

'We are required to complete a risk assessment for everyone released from custody to ensure their safety,' he said.

'Occasionally, it is necessary to use a local taxi service for those who may be more vulnerable, such as young people, particularly if they are released late at night when alternative transport is not available.

'This is a last resort when other options have been exhausted and, on many occasions, those released are taken to a nearby bus station rather than returning them home.'

Deputy Chief Constable Gareth Pritchard said: 'North Wales Police consider the welfare of individuals who leave our custody.

'As part of this process there are occasions when those being released are transported from St Asaph to other locations to facilitate their journey. As St Asaph custody is isolated from the main public transport routes, the expenditure of the force is higher than other forces.

'The force considers that in specific circumstances such expenditure is justified to ensure the person being released has a safe journey.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said they currently have 126 hired vehicles.

'The Metropolitan Police Service hires vehicles to supplement its fleet when additional transport resources are required for increased short-term operational need,' he said.
