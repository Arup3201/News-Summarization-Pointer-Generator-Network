Southampton and England striker Rickie Lambert looks poised to join his boyhood club Liverpool, who released him as a 15-year-old. We asked David Tyrer of fan website Live4Liverpool where he sees the Scouser fitting in to Brendan Rodgers' team and how likely the big man is to succeed.

Hardly a fortnight has passed since the season ended and Liverpool have been linked with nearly half of Southampton's first team. Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Nathaniel Clyne, even Luke Shaw's name has been thrown up. But when Rickie Lambert became the first that the south coast side had received an official bid from Liverpool for it was a shock, to say the least.

Taking to Twitter you could see the concern from many - was this another Andy Carroll in the making? Another Englishman who's ability has been incorrectly inflated by his nationality? Listening to some, it would seem so.

But being a Scouser at Liverpool means much more than being English; it can often afford you more time to prove yourself and, as we've seen in the case of Jon Flanagan, that is no bad thing. It is for this reason (although, not this reason alone) that Lambert's proposed move to Liverpool was greeted by most fans with a kind of whimsical positivity.

'Good for him!' is the almost resounding sentiment, as it is rare that a local lad finally gets the opportunity to play for a club whose crest he has emblazoned on his shoulder at 32, though it should be noted that this move is in no way sentimental by the club.

Sure, the fact that Rickie’s a Scouser will almost certainly help, in that he'll likely give that elusive 'extra 10 per cent' but there is no doubting he is being brought in to do a very specific job.

While Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez will undoubtedly still be the club's main strike-force, Lambert is being purchased for those games when all the skill and trickery in the world get you nowhere, for when you need a totally different approach.

It may now be a dirty phrase in English football but Lambert is a 'traditional centre forward' and at times Liverpool lacked that last season. With the increase in games next season too it would be much more heartening to have an option like Lambert from the bench than Victor Moses or Iago Aspas.

Not another Carroll: The differences between Lambert and Liverpool flop Andy Carroll's games look clear

Many may cry 'What was wrong with Carroll?!' but while their games are somewhat similar, the resounding difference is that Lambert is an experienced, canny pro and - most importantly - scores goals: 28 in his last 2 Premier League seasons, to be precise.

Can you really grumble at a 15 goal-a-season striker for £4 million? Oh, and did I mention he's a Scouser?
