Marco Reus suffered another problem with his left ankle - calling for a stretcher in stoppage time during Germany's 2-1 win over Scotland - just months after being ruled out of the World Cup with a similar issue.

The Borussia Dortmund forward was taken from the field in the closing stages of the Euro 2016 qualifier after tweaking his ankle as he looked to pull away from a Charlie Mulgrew challenge.

Team-mates Thomas Muller and Mario Gotze looked concerned as they watched on and Reus eventually had to be helped from the midfield - minus his boot and sock - by Germany's medical staff.

Concern: It was a positive night for Germany but his team-mates were gutted to see Reus go down

The main concern for Reus, Borussia Dortmund and Germany will be that Reus has had a similar problem before. He has only just returned from a partial tear of an ankle ligament that ruled him out of this summer's triumph in Brazil.

However, Joachim Low told reporters after the game that he did not believe Reus' injury 'to be that bad'.
