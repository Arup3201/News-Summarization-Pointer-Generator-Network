Pinterest, the picture-sharing social media platform typically used to swap recipes and decorating ideas, is being used to share images of child pornography, claims the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force.

The ICAC in Utah has revealed that it has launched 12 different investigations into people posting child porn on Pinterest this year. Charges are pending in all cases.

Investigators said they were initially surprised to find child pornography on the site, as Pinterest doesn’t have advanced privacy settings and it is easy to see exactly who posts which images.

It's just so incredibly brazen,’ Ken Wallentine, who heads the ICAC task force in Utah, told the Desert News.

‘There are people willing to take what I think are crazy risks. My sense is you have to be fairly addicted, fairly controlled by your compulsion, to engage in child pornography behaviors,’ he said.

Federal law requires Pinterest to police itself and all of the cases currently being investigated by Utah authorities were brought to their attention by the social media company.

A Pinterest spokesperson told 
MailOnline: 'We have no tolerance for child exploitation. We actively 
search the site for offending content, report it law enforcement, and 
help prosecute those responsible.'

Each state has an ICAC task force, which
 seeks to catch distributors of child pornography on the internet and to
 catch sexual predators who solicit victims on the internet through chat
 rooms, forums and other methods.

Pinterest, which has 48.7 million users in the U.S., is one of the most popular social media sites behind the likes of Facebook and Twitter.

It has proven especially popular with women and its most popular categories are food & drink, DIY & crafts, women's apparel, home decor and travel.

Until now, Pinterest's pinning etiquette, as its content policy is called, has asked users to report images that contain ‘nudity, partial nudity or pornography’.

But on Thursday it announced that it is to start allowing users to publish more nude images, even as other social networks such as Facebook are clamping down on potentially offensive content.

Pinterest said that it was responding to complaints from artists and photographers against its strict no nudity policy.

‘Pinterest is about expressing your passions and people are passionate about art and that may include nudes,’ the company told the Financial Times. ‘So we're going to try to accommodate that.’
