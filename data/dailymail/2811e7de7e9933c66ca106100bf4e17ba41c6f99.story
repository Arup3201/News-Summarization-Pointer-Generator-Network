There's been speculation that there could soon be blood in the water within government ranks - and it appears at least one front-bencher believes that's already the case - claiming Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and influential Peta Credlin, the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, are 'like two Siamese fighting fish stuck in the same tank'.

The Australian on Wednesday reported that the working relationship between the pair is effectively over and that the only person capable of bringing the internal battle to an end, the Prime Minister, 'isn't going to get rid of Peta' according to the front-bencher.

However, a spokesperson from Julie Bishop's office told Daily Mail Australia that the Foreign Minister stands by her claims that the pair have not had a cross word and she does not want anyone else's job. There's been speculation in recent days that Bishop is primed to take over as leader, if needed.

'I genuinely don’t know anything about those claims,' the spokesperson said.

Julie Bishop has proved to be one of the government's shining lights in 2014 but her recent rifts with the Prime Minister and his Chief of Staff is causing concern within Cabinet ranks

'They are like two Siamese fighting fish stuck in the same tank!' A Liberal front-bencher is claimed to have said about Peta Credlin's apparent frosty relationship with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop

The Foreign Minister and Deputy Liberal Leader has reportedly refused to take any orders from Peta Credlin, who is the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff

'There is nothing that I am aware of that could possibly be reported coming from the Foreign Minister or her office, both (Bishop and Credlin) have said that there was nothing to the claims and I think it’s fair to say we need to go on what both have said, exactly.'

There are also claims that the Foreign Minister has made a decision not to take any more orders from Peta Credlin while other senior Cabinet members reportedly also believe the PM's senior adviser wields too much influence.

The Australian quoted the front-bencher as saying 'Tony isn’t going to get rid of Peta and Julie isn’t going to stop' and goes on to quote another MP 'what is Julie supposed to do? Perform worse to make Tony look better by way of comparison?'

But Ms Credlin told the newspaper that 'we continue to work in a close and collegial way, I admire Julie for her tenacity and skill as a minister'.

Julie Bishop's office stands by her claim that she has not had any 'cross words' with Peta Credlin and they have no idea where the suggestions of a bust-up have originated

One front-bencher says Julie Bishop is unhappy at the level of control Peta Credlin as the PM's chief of staff. The Foreign Minister's office denies the claims

Recent polls under-score her increasing popularity, with Julie Bishop's approval rating as preferred Liberal Leader more than doubling in the past five months, second only to Malcolm Turnbull

What has become apparent is that there are factions building within government ranks - those who back the strong-performing Foreign Minister and others, loyal to the PM, who believe she is being overly-promoted to his detriment.

Recent polls underscore her increasing popularity, with Julie Bishop's approval rating as preferred Liberal Leader more than doubling in the past five months, second only to Malcolm Turnbull. 

The reports of this latest rift come after a week of high drama for the government front-bench, including a widely-reported argument between Julie Bishop and the PM himself after she read media reports that a male colleague would 'chaperone' her to the United Nations climate change conference in Lima, Peru.

Two reported bust-ups in the past week with the PM's office. Julie Bishop took issue with Tony Abbott's decision to 'chaperone' her at the United Nations conference and now there are claims she is at odds with his chief of staff, Peta Credlin

The Foreign Minister was not consulted about the plan for Andrew Robb, who is ranked below Ms Bishop in the Cabinet, to shadow her and confronted Tony Abbott on the matter, reports said.

It was further claimed that he was being sent to Peru with the Deputy Liberal Party Leader to ensure that Australia did not over-commit on its climate change policy promises.

The bust-ups have overshadowed a significant announcement in Lima by Ms Bishop that Australia will contribute $200 million to a global fund to help poorer nations tackle climate change.

Prime Minister Abbott said it was fair and reasonable for the government to pledge a contribution despite having ruled it out at the G20 summit in Brisbane.

'We've seen things develop over the last few months,' he told reporters in Melbourne.

Australia's commitment would contribute to emission reduction projects in the region, Mr Abbott added.

Health Minister Peter Dutton, was not buying into the drama around Julie Bishop and Peta Credlin, on Wednesday.

'I see two highly competent people who are very effective at their job and serving their nation well,' he said.

Julie Bishop enjoys strong support from within Cabinet but there are some MPs who claim her increasing profile is undermining the Prime Minister

Causing further consternation were revelations that the PM initially had no plans to send any of his ministers to the global climate negotiations in Peru, where up to 200 other countries would be.

Ms Bishop will talk international climate policy ahead of next year's 2015 Paris conference, which is being held to achieve a universal agreement on climate change, from all the nations of the world.

Mr Abbott last week admitted the government had been performing in a 'ragged' way in recent days.

The Foreign Minister has scored impressive wins at home and abroad in 2014 and has won support with her influence in the unanimous resolution of the UN Security Council to demand access to the crash site of MH17
