A stray bison which charmed a village of Poles has been shot dead by local farmers who feared the animal was seducing all of their cows.

The animal, nicknamed Bartek the Bison, first appeared in Lakiele in autumn and quickly became a staple of village life. 

But after spending time grazing with cattle herds, the bison attracted the attention of the village's cows.

After growing accustomed to life in the village of Lakiele in northern Poland, the animal became acquainted with the local cattle herds 

To the horror of local farmers, the livestock stopped returning to their barns to be milked at night instead staying in the field with Bartek. 

After calling a village meeting, the farmers agreed the animal should be killed despite protests from other residents. 

They hired two hunters to shoot Bartek dead before carting him off in a truck. 

The town's mayor, Jan Zaborowski, said the animal was causing no harm to the majority of the village. 

'Despite his great size he was very gentle and was even given the name Bartek. We have no idea where he came from or how he got there, but he didn’t do any harm. 

'He interested the locals and so he was fed and nobody bothered him. As a result although he was nervous at the start he began to spend more time in the local pastures than in the forest.

'At night the cows would stay with him rather than in their barn. I guess he was building himself a family and a herd of his own which is perfectly natural. 

'But that didn’t impress the owners of the cows who were used to them coming home in the evening to be milked. All of a sudden they were staying out with the bison instead.'

Millions of bison are thought to have roamed north America at one time, with slightly smaller versions of the animal found in Europe. 

The last wild European bison is thought to have been killed in 1929, with the only remaining members of the species protected in zoos or conservation efforts. 

A small number were released into the wild in the 1950's, with herds roaming across Eastern European countries today.
