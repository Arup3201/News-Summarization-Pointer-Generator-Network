Raving: Dominic Adesanya had to be carried out of court by bailiffs

A man charged with jumping
the White House fence last week was dragged screaming from a
courtroom on Monday after a federal judge declared him
incompetent to stand trial.

The suspect, Dominic Adesanya, 23, of Bel Air, Maryland, 
was stopped by Secret Service dogs before being arrested on
Wednesday. He was reportedly unarmed at the time of his arrest
and U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson on Thursday ordered a
mental screening for him.

U.S. Magistrate Judge John Facciola said during a
preliminary hearing that doctors found Adesanya incompetent to
stand trial.

'You can't do this to me! Somebody please help me!' screamed
Adesanya, struggling to escape from the grip of court marshals
after the judge spoke.

'This is a trap! This is a scheme!' he shouted as officials
dragged him from the courtroom.

Facciola ordered that Adesanya remain in custody for
evaluation and treatment. He is set to appear in court on December  22.

Video showed Secret Service agents surrounding the suspected
intruder on the north lawn of the White House, which was put on
lockdown for about 90 minutes. The man punched and kicked the
Secret Service dogs that stopped him, the video showed.

The two dogs, Hurricane and Jordan, were taken to a
veterinarian for injuries sustained during the incident,
according to a Secret Service spokesman.

Adesanya cannot be arraigned without being found competent
to stand trial. Preliminary federal charges against Adesanya are
harming the Secret Service dogs and unlawfully entering the
restricted grounds of the White House, both misdemeanors.

Adesanya faces two other misdemeanor charges from earlier
incidents charged in a lower court.

His father told a Baltimore television station last week
that his son was 'mentally disturbed.'

Last week's incident came about a month after an intruder
armed with a knife scaled the White House fence and made it
inside the executive mansion. The breach raised questions about
security at the complex and spurred the resignation of Secret
Service Director Julia Pierson.

The Secret Service has been criticized in recent weeks after an intruder was able to make it into the White House armed with a knife before he was tackled
