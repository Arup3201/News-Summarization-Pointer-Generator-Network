The Dark Knight gunman sent a notebook filled with details and drawings about how he was going to kill people to his university psychiatrist one week before the shooting - but it sat unopened in the campus mail room.

The revelation will undoubtedly lead many to come to the awful conclusion the massacre could have been prevented and 12 lives could have been spared.

A law enforcement source told Fox News that the package was only discovered on Monday but they suspect it had lain there undetected since July 12.

Bizarre behavior: James Holmes, pictured at his first court appearance on Monday, was involved with a number of prostitutes in the months before the massacre

No sense: Students and faculty who knew Mr Holmes from the University of Colorado at Denver scrambled via e-mail to make sense of the shooting

Bomb scare: Although that package turned out to be from someone else and harmless, a search of the Campus Services' mailroom turned up another package

Disturbing: A poster on the wall is seen inside the apartment where accused killer James Homes lived

James Holmes' name was written in the return address box. The package was turned up after an extensive search of the campus' mail room. It is not known why it was not delivered to its intended recipient.

Authorities then obtained a warrant from a district judge to open the package, which is when its chilling contents were discovered.

The source told Fox: 'Inside the package was a notebook full 
of details about how he was going to kill people.

'There were drawings of what he was going to do in it - 
drawings and illustrations of the massacre.'

The spiral-bound pad was said to be filled with gun-wielding stick figures blowing away other stick figures.

The notebook is now in the possession of the FBI but it has fueled speculation that an earlier discovery could have prevented the senseless tragedy which unfolded at a Colorado movie theater less than a week ago.

Police and FBI agents were called to the University of Colorado's Anschutz medical campus in Aurora on Monday morning after the psychiatrist and professor at the school reported receiving a package believed to be from the suspect.

Though the package in question turned out to be from someone else, this prompted an extensive search of the campus mail room which uncovered the notebook.

It is not yet clear whether or not the psychiatrist had any previous contact with Holmes but it is likely, considering that the 24-year-old studied various mental health issues before he dropped out of the university's neuroscience program.

The psychiatrist was also a professor at the college.

The New York Daily News reported today that Holmes asked a prison guard if he had watched The Dark Knight Rises yet and how the film ended.

The 24-year-old bought a ticket to the midnight screening but allegedly left after half an hour to put on the body armor stored in his care before returning to the theater and opening fire.

A jail employee told the Daily News that Holmes's voice was flat and his eyes glazed over when he asked, and repeated the question when he was ignored.

When I knew James Holmes, the Colorado shooter, he was Jimmy. I was his fifth-grade teacher and he lives in a tiny town of 5,000 called Castroville.

Recalling him at school, he was well-dressed, neat, wore glasses, liked to read and excelled in all academic areas. He had two really good friends, both sharp like him — in fact, top of the class.

What happened to him? James had everything going for him. He lived in the wealthy part of town; I’m pretty sure both of his parents had white-collar jobs.

How can we know what happened ?” IPerhaps he became psychotic. It shows up in people in their 20s. Maybe he used wicked sanity-eating drugs like OxyContin, meth, crack, and it destroyed his mind. I don’t know.

Some people will always snap. They’ll commit crimes of passion, commit dark acts under the influence of drugs, anger, lust, misperception, racism, ignorance and poor or wrong decision making.

I fear that in schools somewhere out there, more people like James Holmes are festering.

A jail 
employee told the Daily News that Holmes's voice was flat and his eyes 
glazed over when he asked, and repeated the question when he was 
ignored.

'He was trying to look like he was sincerely curious. Like he had no idea why there was anything wrong with what he was saying. It was sick...I think he’s trying real hard to act crazy.'

Holmes remains in solitary confinement in the Arapahoe County Detention Center. He was moved to the infirmary Tuesday for his own protection, sources told The News.

Prison officials fitted him with a black plastic face guard to stop him from spitting on guards.

It emerged today that three days 
before he dropped out of university, Holmes failed a key exam, prompting him to buy a 
terrifying arsenal of weapons.

Experts
 have suggested that it may have been the stress of failing the exam 
coupled with the pressure to follow in his brilliant father's over-achieving 
footsteps 
which triggered an underlying mental illness.

Robert Holmes, 61, has degrees from Stanford, UCLA and Berkeley and currently works as a senior scientist at FICO in San Diego.

Holmes' fifth grade elementary school teacher wrote a letter to the New York Post wondering what had happened to his former student he recalled as being sharp, neat, well-dressed and top of the class.

He laments as to how or why he suddenly snapped when he came from such a normal, stable background.

Questions: Holmes has been uncooperative since 
arriving at jail, which is at odds with the man who told police his had 
rigged his apartment with explosives (pictured) after his arrest

Explosive: More than 30 homemade grenades, ten gallons of gasoline, improvised explosive devices (IED's) and trip wires or trigger mechanisms were secured from the apartment

Police believe the attack was meticulously planned and Holmes had been collecting and storing the weaponry - which included 6,000 rounds of ammunition and several automatic rifles and hand guns - months in advance.

It is also believed that the Century 16 theater was not his original intended target.

The National Enquirer reported that an initial police investigation showed the Colorado gunman planned on traveling 
to New York City for the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises so he could 
shoot dead the stars of the movie.

University of Colorado spokeswoman Jacque Montgomery told Fox she was not aware of the contents of the package or who had sent it.
