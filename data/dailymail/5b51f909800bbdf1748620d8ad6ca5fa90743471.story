Andy Carroll has revealed the shocking state of his knee after major surgery on the injury that will keep him sidelined for the rest of the season.

The 26-year-old West Ham striker suffered torn ligaments in his left knee during West Ham's 0-0 draw with Southampton last week and had surgery on Tuesday.

After previously posting a picture of his swollen and bandaged leg, Carroll took to Instagram again as he shared images of his wounds.

September 2012 - Picks up hamstring injury in his first game on loan - out for a month

November 2012 -Twists knee against Manchester United - sidelined for two months

May 2013 - Damages heel in the last game of the season - out for seven months

July 2014 - Tears ankle ligaments in pre-season - sidelined for four months

February 2015 - Tears knee ligaments against Southampton - out for the season

The pictures reveal a large scar down the side of Carroll's knee with two further incisions close to the kneecap and just above it.

Carroll at least appeared in good spirits following the surgery, posting the caption: 'That's knee modelling out the window!! Great job by Mr Andy Williams.'

Fears over Carroll's injury grew after pictures emerged of the striker leaving St Mary's on crutches following the Southampton stalemate.

Speaking last week manager Sam Allardyce had hoped that Carroll would only be out for between four and six weeks but a specialist later confirmed the England international required surgery.

The injury is a major blow to Carroll, who has started just 24 games in the last 18 months because of three different injuries.

Carroll made his first appearance of the season in November because of ankle problems that required surgery in pre-season. Hopes were high after Carroll scored five goals in 11 league starts.

But the former England striker then injured his left knee against Liverpool on January 31 and it was on his return from that injury that Carroll, appearing as a substitute against Southampton last Wednesday, suffered his latest problem to the same knee.

With West Ham having used their substitutes and down to 10 men, Carroll stayed on the pitch to help grind out the 0-0 draw. With hindsight, that decision appears to have backfired on a player who cost West Ham £15m in June 2013.
