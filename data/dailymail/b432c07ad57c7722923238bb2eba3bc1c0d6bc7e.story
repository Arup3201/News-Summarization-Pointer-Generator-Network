Natasha Leggero, the comic who was slammed as 'disgusting' for making a joke that World War II veterans are so old they are only able to chew SpaghettiOs during NBC's New Year's Eve coverage, says she is not sorry for the jab that created controversy for the TV network.

The 31-year-old comedian angered some audience members during NBC's 'New Year's Eve With Carson Daly' when she made an offhand remark in regard to a tasteless tweet that SpaghettiOs had posted on Pearl Harbor Day.

'I mean, it sucks that the only survivors of Pearl Harbor are being mocked by the only food they can still chew,' Leggero quipped.

Deluged in angry Tweets, most of which can't be published, Leggero responded in a post on her blog on Friday, reported the New York Daily News.

'I'm not sorry,' she wrote.

Cruel: Natasha Leggero, right, appeared on Carson Daly's New Year's Eve show and joked that Pearl Harbor survivors are now so old they can only eat SpaghettiOs because they're softÂ 

'I don't think the amazing courage of American veterans and specifically those who survived Pearl Harbor is in any way diminished by a comedian making a joke about dentures on television.'

'Do we really believe that the people who fought an defended our freedom against Nazis an the Axis powers will find a joke about SpaghettiO's too much to bear? Sorry, I have more respect for veterans than to think their honor can be impugned by a glamorous, charming comedian in a fur hat.'

Leggero pointed to issues with care of veterans as a larger issue than her remark.

'On the one hand you have me, making a joke about how old people can't chew tough foods very well,' she wrote.

'On the other hand you have Veterans who receive inadequate care upon their return from active duty, rampant sexual assault against female soldiers, staggering rates of suicide, traumatic brain injury, PTSD, substance abuse and depression among soldiers and political gridlock that prevents these problems from getting solved quickly.'

'Where do you think your outrage and action would be better served, calling me a c-t or doing something about the above problem?' Leggero concluded.

The drama started when Spaghetti0s tweeted a pictured of their mascot holding an American flag and asking people to 
'take a moment to remember #PearlHarbor with us' - which some saw as a 
tasteless marketing ploy.

Oops: Leggero's comment came as the guests spoke about an insensitive tweet that SpaghettiOs had sent out on Pearl Harbor Day

'It offended a lot of people, corporations glomming on to, you know, 
sentimental American historic traditions, seemingly looking for people 
in business. It wasn't good. But you were offended for another reason,' 
Daly said.

'I'm offended because they were referring to SpaghettiOs as pasta,' said Jane Lynch.

Leggero then added: 'It sucks that the only survivors of Pearl Harbor are being mocked by the only food they can still chew.'

After Leggero mocked the veterans, Anthony Anderson whooped with laughter - and couldn't stop.

As the segment aired, viewers were not impressed.

'Natasha
 Leggero just made a joke about the SpaghettiOs Pearl Harbor tweet that 
was probably more offensive than the tweet itself,' one viewer wrote on 
Twitter.

'Making fun of Pearl Harbor vets? Changing channel. Disgusting. Really NBC?' another said.

One other viewer added on the network's Facebook page: 'Shame on you, NBC, for making fun of the WWII vets.'

Attack: After Leggero, pictured, made the comment, viewers slammed NBC across social networking sites

Having a laugh: The other guests, especially actor Anthony Anderson, left, found her comment hilarious. Glee favorite Jany Lynch said what she found more offensive was SpaghettiOs being deemed 'a pasta'

After SpaghettiOs' insensitive tweet last month, the company issued an apology.

'We apologize for our recent tweet in remembrance of Pearl Harbor Day,' it wrote on its Twitter account. 'We meant to pay respect, not to offend.'
