The fan who ran up the touchline to confront Arsene Wenger in Arsenal's defeat by Southampton on Thursday has been charged by the police.

Luke Bryant was hauled away by two stewards after running up to Wenger and his assistant Steve Bould, who were sat in the away dugout at St Mary's.

He has been charged for 'going on to area adjacent to playing area contrary to the Football (Offences) Act 1991' and is due to appear at Southampton Magistrates' Court on January 22.

Stewards quickly led the man away, and Wenger showed little reaction to the confrontation

Wenger tried to play down the incident after the match and claimed it was a Southampton fan. But the Saints believe it was an Arsenal follower who had bought a ticket amongst the home supporters.

A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said: 'Police arrested a 25-year-old man from Lymington following an incident on the pitch at St Mary's at the end of the Southampton vs Arsenal match.

'Luke Bryant, was subsequently charged with an offence going on to area adjacent to playing area contrary to the Football (Offences) Act 1991, he is due to appear at Southampton Magistrates' Court on January 22.'

Southampton have vowed to take the severest action against the fan.
