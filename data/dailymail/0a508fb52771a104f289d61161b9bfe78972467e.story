A tax on plastic bags in Wales has seen the number given away by shops fall by up to 96 per cent.

The news will heap pressure on David Cameron to make good his promise to tackle the blight of plastic bags and introduce a levy in England.

As well as cutting bag use, the Welsh scheme has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for charities.

The country has seen public support for the 5p tax rise from 59 per cent to 70 per cent since its introduction last October, according to researchers.

And the programme is set to be the template for similar schemes in Scotland and Northern Ireland, while cities and countries across the globe are pursuing similar controls.

The tax’s success is a vindication of the Daily Mail’s Banish the Bags campaign, which has won support from across the political spectrum and campaign groups including the Marine Conservation Society and National Trust.

A Cardiff University study into the Welsh bag charge, published yesterday, found that support for the scheme rose to 70 per cent six months after its introduction. Opposition dropped to just 17 per cent.

Over the same period, the number of shoppers who said they used their own bags on their  latest supermarket visit rose from 61 per cent to 82 per cent.

Figures provided to the researchers by a sample of retailers, including Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s, the Co-operative, McDonald’s and John Lewis, revealed a big reduction in bag numbers.

Supermarkets reported a drop of up to 96 per cent, while numbers were down 95 per cent at DIY warehouses, 85 per cent at mobile phone shops, 75 per cent in clothing stores and 45 per cent at fast food outlets.

But despite these encouraging Welsh statistics, official figures published today are expected to show the number of bags handed out by major stores has increased by at least 350million in a year.

The Prime Minister repeatededly promised both before and after the general election to tackle the blight associated with plastic bags.

It is understood that the idea of introducing a charge in England has the support of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, but the Chancellor George Osborne and the Treasury have – to date – blocked it.

The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘We do want to work with retailers to see if we can reduce the number of bags they hand out. We are looking at the results of the scheme in Wales and the Scottish consultation.

‘Defra has been having meetings with retailers to discover how we can achieve that [reduction].’

A source close to Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman added: ‘All options are on the table.

‘The Welsh scheme seems to have had a downward pressure on the use of plastic bags. We appreciate the positive effects that has had but there is an issue that any extra cost, however small, at a time when people are short is difficult. We are keen to encourage the use of bags for life, particularly light cotton ones.’

The Welsh study found women and older people were particularly supportive of the bag charge.

Consumers were also keen on the idea that money raised by the levy goes to charities, rather than the government.

The research team concluded: ‘This evaluation of the behavioural and attitudinal impacts of the introduction of the single-use carrier bag charge in Wales has shown that the policy is popular and effective.

‘The charge has helped to greatly increase own-bag use in Wales across all age groups and for men and women alike.’
