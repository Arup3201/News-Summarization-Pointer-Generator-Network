Facebook billionaire Sean Parker has been slapped with a $2.5 million penalty after he failed to get the proper permits for his 'Game of Thrones' style Big Sur wedding.

The California Coastal Commission and Parker said they have reached a settlement to pay for coastal conservation programs after the Napster co-founder built a large movie-set like wedding site in an ecologically sensitive area of Big Sur.

Officials were tipped off about Parker's lavish $10 million wedding, which saw him build a cottage, fake ruins, waterfalls, staircases and a huge dance floor near iconic redwoods and a stream with threatened steelhead trout, when neighbors complained.

The complaints prompted a county investigation into the construction at a closed campground owned by Ventana Inn & Spa. The Ventana is negotiating a separate settlement for allowing the construction to occur.

The Ventana is located within the 
coastal zone, an area regulated by the commission, an independent state 
agency that oversees coastal development. Any significant construction 
within the zone has to be permitted.

When staff inspected, they found the temporary structures had already been built, but allowed the wedding to proceed anyway.

The commission started negotiating a 
settlement with Parker and his representatives for the violations 
instead of shutting the event down.

'Mr. Parker has been extremely 
cooperative and actively involved in working with Coastal Commission 
staff to reach this resolution which both addresses our Coastal Act 
concerns and will result in greater coastal access and conservation in 
the Big Sur and Monterey Peninsula areas,' Charles Lester, the 
commission's executive director, said in a statement.

Parker, 33, the former president of 
Facebook who was portrayed by Justin Timberlake in the movie 'The Social
 Network,' married singer-songwriter Alexandra Lenas on Saturday in a 
ceremony with gowns and sets made by a designer for the 'Lord of the 
Rings' films.

Since Parker did not get permits for 
the construction, commission staff will oversee the breakdown of the 
vast set so no damage is done to the environment. The commission said no
 major damage had yet been done, but it wanted to reach a deal quickly 
so the violating structures could be removed safely.

'Normally (negotiations) happen over a
 couple of months, but because of the nature of the violations here we 
wanted to get it out as soon as possible so Mr. Parker could go ahead 
and do the work the way it should be done,' said Lisa Haage, the 
commission's chief of enforcement.

Money from the agreement may be used 
to purchase public easements and hiking trails in the Big Sur area and 
as grants for nonprofits doing conservation projects.

Also, as part of the settlement, 
Parker will have to produce and distribute a public education video or 
create a mobile app aimed at helping to identify areas where the public 
can access the coast.

Haage said the commission is hopeful 
Parker's assistance will help it spread more information about 
California's coastal resources.

Parker said he was delighted to help.

'We always dreamed of getting married
 in Big Sur, one of the most magical places on Earth,' Parker said in a 
statement. 'In continuing my foundation's mission, we are excited to 
support these important conservation-related projects for and with the 
local community.'

The commission will vote on the agreement at its next meeting scheduled June 14.

The pair's story-book forest wedding took place in front of 300 friends and family members.

Looking every inch the happy couple, 
the Internet entrepreneur who is estimated to be worth $2 billion is now
 officially hitched to the mother of his young daughter after his 
wedding at the swanky Ventana Inn.

The ceremony and reception featured 
opulent decorations including a ruin, a waterfall and long feast style tables. 

'Forget
 what you heard about Sean Parker's wedding,' friend John Perry Barlow 
tweeted following the ceremony. 'It [was] elegant, tasteful, and 
magical.'

They 'have just been enormously generous to their friends. We are all very grateful', he wrote.

The bride wore a dress that appears similar to Daenerys Targaryen from the hit HBO show, Game of Thrones.

Parker is believed to have 
shelled out $10 million to turn the boutique hotel into what looked like a 
movie set, equipped with outfits for 
guests designed by the costume designer for the Lord of the Rings 
movies.

One source told the New York Post
 that guests 'entered down a long trail and came to a big gate and 
entered this other world in a forest there'... They made the forest come
 alive.'

The ceremony was officiated by Unitarian Universalist minister John A. Buehrens.

The extensive guest list included Sting and his wife Trudie,
 Allison Williams, Emma Watson, Sean Lennon and Charlotte Kemp Muhl, 
Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich, Perry and Etty Farrell and Lucian Grainge.

Jacqueline
 Laurita, from the Real Housewives of New Jersey, also attended the 
event and shared photographs of the lavish hotel on Twitter.

'Words
 can not even describe how beautiful the wedding I went to yesterday 
was,' she gushed. 'Nothing like I've ever seen. I felt like I was in a 
fairy [tale].'

The political world was represented by 
California Attorney General Kamela Harris, Lt. Gov Gavin Newsom and 
Newark Mayor Cory Booker.

Lenas' gown was by Elie Saab, while Parker, 33, the couple's infant 
daughter Winter Victoria and the guests were dressed by Academy 
Award-winning costume designer Ngila Dickson.

Designer Ken Fulk, caterer Paula 
LeDuc 
and designer Preston Bailey, who designed the flowers, all helped 
coordinate the massive affair. Mark Seliger was the photographer.

Guests enjoyed cake from Perfect Endings as well as music by Loreena McKennitt and The Good The Bad and The Ginger.

Parker
 had previously denied the Game of Thrones theme on his Twitter account,
 but admitted they would be instructing guests on what to wear.

'Just
 because we don't trust our guests to dress themselves properly doesn't 
mean we want them to look like #GoT characters,' he wrote in April.

'Academy
 award winning costume designer Ngila Dickson is creating gorgeous, 
inspiring, and unique designs that are both modern and whimsical.'

He hired a landscaping company to 
build fake ruins, waterfalls, man made ponds, bridges and a gated 
cottage in the surrounding woods at the hotel, sources told TMZ in 
April.

Beautiful: The California Coastal Commission was called in to investigate whether the inn had procured the proper permits for the wedding-related construction

The venue included two terraces that 
are used for weddings, that offer 'privacy and an uninterrupted 50-mile 
view of the Big Sur coastline to the south,' according to its website. 

The Inn boasts its design is mean to 'complement nature and encourage guests to experience the essence of romance.'

Residents in the California community have been less than thrilled with the attention Parker's spectacle has attracted.

The  San Jose Mercury News reported earlier that the California Coastal Commission was called in to investigate whether the inn had procured the
 proper permits for the wedding-related construction.

'We're
 pretty used to celebrities being in Big Sur. But for this one, they've 
basically built a movie set to have their wedding,' Stan Russell, head of the city's chamber of commerce, told the paper.

Russell said the construction would go
 away after the Saturday bash and expects the attention the town 
receives could actually help the wedding industry in the city.

'The
 wedding planners in Big Sur are planning ahead for 2014 already, 
because they're booked. People want to come and see what all of the 
excitement's about,' Russell said.

Guests were expected to enter through a $600,000 gate, 
dance on a $350,000 floor and walk past more than $1 million worth of 
plants and flowers, the gossip website site.

The New York Post reported that the save-the-date cards for the June 1 wedding look like wizard scrolls.

Business: The town's chamber of commerce expects that Parker's extravagant ceremony could spark a wedding boom in the California town

'There is a chance the wedding could end up looking like an episode of Game of Thrones,' an insider told the Post.

Game of Thrones is a popular Medieval fantasy TV show on HBO that features knights and dragons and sorcery.

Parker
 is worth an estimated $2 billion after becoming the founder of Napster 
and other tech start-ups and working with Facebook creator Mark 
Zuckerberg during the early days of the social network.

The internet 
guru is most famous for his portrayal in the movie Social Network, which
 details the role he played in the beginnings of Facebook. Justin Timberlake played him in the Oscar-winning movie.

Parker proposed to Lenas, a 
singer-songwriter, in February after she gave birth to the couple's 
daughter, Winter Victoria Parker.
