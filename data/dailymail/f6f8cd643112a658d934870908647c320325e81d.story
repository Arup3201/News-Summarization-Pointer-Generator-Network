A couple have given over their home to raise a 385lb pig - after mistakenly believing it was a mini breed.

Steve Jenkins and Derek Walter, from Toronto, Canada, had no idea their pet swine, affectionately called Esther, would become the enormous house guest it is today.

When they took in what they thought was a
 'mini pig' they assumed it would not grow to more than 70lbs.

Little 
did they know the pig, which weighed just a couple of pounds when they 
agreed to look after it for a Facebook friend, that it would become five
 times bigger.

Mr Jenkins, 31, told GoodMorningAmercia.com: 'She said she had a mini pig that wasn't getting along with her two dogs and new baby and it was causing a lot of chaos, so I told her I'd love to take her.'

The couple discovered their mistaken when they took their new pet to the vets.

It was quickly pointed out that they had a rather large problem on their hands. But they had now become too attached to the pig and had no intention of letting it go.

Jenkins and Walter took Esther welcomed her into their home, raising her just like one of their two other dogs.

But Mr Jenkins says they could not bear to be separate from their beloved pig.

'She's infectious. 'There's something about her personality. And she's so unbelievably intelligent,' Mr Jenkins said.

'She will actively seek us out to cuddle,' he explained to ABC News.

'If she wants to sleep, she wants to sleep with you. She climbs right up on the couch with us. That's her preferred spot to sleep.

The story of the cute animal happily co-existing with humans in apparent domestic bliss has convinced another of people to give up eating meat and become vegans.

A Facebook page, called Esther the Wonder Pig, dedicated to documenting the daily life of Esther has received almost 55,000 likes.

Patricia Palmer Budai wrote on the Facebook page: 'My daughter-in-law introduced me to your Facebook page today.

'You, dear Esther, reinforce my commitment to transition to vegan in the near future. I am new to the vegetarian lifestyle, at age 67, and am sorry I did not start sooner.

'Your Dads are my kind of people! PS My mom had a regular sized pet pig nearly 80 years ago. I think she would have loved you too. May you have only the sweetest of dreams, dear girl.'
