A California teenager convicted of murdering an aspiring boxer after baiting him with a fake Facebook profile has been sentenced to life in prison.

Manuel Edmundo Guzman Jr, 19, of San Jacinto, was convicted earlier this year of setting up a fake Facebook profile using the picture of an internet model and then killing Eddie Leal, 23, when he showed up to meet the non-existent woman.

Mr Guzman was only 17 when he shot Mr Leal to death, prohibiting the prosecution from seeking the death penalty, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Mr Guzman admitted to the killing during a preliminary hearing, officials skipped the trial and went directly to the sentencing, the Times noted.

The murderer will spend the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole after officials claimed 
Guzman's motive was to kill for a 'thrill.'

Mr Guzman's 'thrill kill' of Mr Leal came after exchanging messages with the professional bantamweight 
boxer with the fake account under the name Rebecca Santhiago, officials said. The account is still active on Facebook.

The account paints a picture of a single 21-year-old, who 'loves to kick it at house parties or clubs' and asks for men to 'show some love and maybe we can hang out.'

Prosecutors described the photo used as showing 'a curvy, attractive, young brunette in a tight dress who was smiling seductively.'

Mr Leal began Facebook messaging 'Santhiago' and a meeting was arranged in a San Jacinto park at around 2 am on May 30, 2011, it is alleged.

The prosecution claims that when Mr Leal arrived he encountered Mr Guzman, who shot him several times, in what attorneys describe as a 'thrill kill.'

Mr Leal died at the scene and authorities found the up and coming boxer in the driver's seat of his Toyota Corolla in Roanoke Street, San Jacinto.

After a year-long investigation, detectives allegedly tracked the bogus Facebook profile to a computer at Mr Guzman’s mother’s house, where he lived.

Investigator Tony Pelato, a computer forensics expert, told The Press Enterprise that he had 'no doubt at all' that Santhiago’s chat messages were typed on Mr Guzman’s computer.

A copy of the Facebook page and the chat messages were reportedly also found on the victim's computer.

Guzman was arrested and charged on April 10, 2012. He was already on probation for a juvenile conviction the previous year.

According to the prosecution, the victim came to meet the fictional woman at this street corner but instead was fatally shot
