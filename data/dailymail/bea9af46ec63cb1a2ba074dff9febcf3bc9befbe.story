A family of 12 are facing having to eat microwave Christmas dinners after claiming Homebase has left them without a kitchen.

Katie Sutton and her fiance Alfie Johnson paid £6,000 for a brand new kitchen for their first home together in West Malling, Kent.

The couple ordered everything including counter tops, a new sink, fridge, dishwasher, cupboards and even an oven from their local branch in Aylesford, Kent on September 8.

But despite ripping out all of their old appliances ready for their new kitchen to be fitted on October 23, the delivery men only arrived with just the hob and a sink.

Miss Sutton, 28, and Mr Johnson, 32, a grocer, were then forced to wait for the rest of the appliances to arrive on December 4 before they could be fitted on December 8.

But when the kitchen fitters arrived to install their appliances, their oven had still not arrived.

They also added that most of all their other items had been cut to the wrong measurements, meaning the new kitchen would not fit.

Their cooker is due to arrive tomorrow but there are no fitters around to install the kitchen for at least five weeks - well into the new year.

Without an oven or a hob, Miss Sutton is now unable to cook Christmas dinner for the 12 people her and her fiance Alfie Johnson had invited to their new home

Miss Sutton, a beautician said: 'The kitchen was fitted and plans were drawn up so we couldn’t believe it when they said it wouldn’t fit.

'We found out cupboards were much bigger than they were supposed to be and the Homebase worker had not taken into account the size of the pipes.

'We’ve been having takeaway and ready meals everyday. Homebase said they would pay for that but we don’t have money to pay for them in the first place.

'I’ve rung the man who I drew up the plans and who came to measure the kitchen 46 times but he still hasn’t called me back.

'I took it further and we had a meeting with Homebase and I’ve called them every day but they have haven’t apologised.

'They’re quick enough to sell a kitchen but act completely evasive when it all goes wrong. I’m devastated.

'At any other time than Christmas I’d be a bit understanding but we’ve just bought a house and want our friends and family to enjoy Christmas with us.

'I wanted to cook for them in my new kitchen but now I don’t know what to do.

'At the moment it just looks like Christmas is cancelled.'

The couple had invited both of their parents, Mr Johnson's two sisters and their partners and three children as well as one family friend to spend Christmas Day with them.

The group had all wanted to be together and none of the other family homes are big enough.

Miss Sutton has already bought most of her family's Christmas dinner, which is being kept in a freezer - but it cannot be cooked without an oven and now looks set to go to waste.

Though Homebase have admitted fault, the couple say they have been 'arrogant' and 'unapologetic' and have ruined their Christmas.

A Homebase spokeswoman said: 'Homebase would like to sincerely apologise to Miss Sutton and Mr Johnson for the issues they have experienced with the delivery of their new kitchen.

'We have spoken to the customer and are working with them and the third party delivery firm to ensure the problem is resolved as soon as possible.'
