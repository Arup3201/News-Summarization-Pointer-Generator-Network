Crystal Palace are set to hijack Leicester City's move for Wigan midfielder James McArthur.

Having secured the return of Wilfried Zaha, new Eagles manager Neil Warnock has set his sights on the Latics midfielder.

McArthur looked set for a move to the Barclays Premier League newcomers after the Foxes agreed a deal with Wigan.

Tough decision: James McArthur needs to choose between Neil Warnock's Crystal Palace and Nigel Pearson's Leicester City 

Signed, sealed and delivered: Neil Warnock has already managed to lure Wilfried Zaha back to Crystal Palace

But Palace's interest has thrown a spanner in the works for Nigel Pearson. 

The Leicester manager had already strengthened his squad with five new signings, including £7million striker Leonardo Ulloa, who scored in his debut for the Foxes against Everton on the opening weekend.

With Pearson looking to build a squad that will establish itself in the Barclays Premier League, and Warnock trying to rebuild the Eagles to survive a second season in the top tier of English football, McArthur has got a decision to make before the transfer deadline on Monday
