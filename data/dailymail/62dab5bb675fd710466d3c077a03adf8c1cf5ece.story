Tens of thousands of Muslims took to the streets in Pakistan in anger at the Prophet Mohammed cartoons published by French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

The largest rally was held in Karachi, where 25,000 people shouted slogans including 'death to France', 'death to the blasphemers' and '(We are) ready to sacrifice life for Prophet Mohammed'.

Anger remains potent over the repeated depiction of the Muslim prophet in the satirical magazine, whose Paris offices were attacked on January 7 by Islamist gunmen, killing 12 people.

'We are ready to sacrifice life for Prophet Mohammed': The largest rally was held in Karachi, where 25,000 people turned up to chant slogans, wave flags and listen to speakers condemning Charlie Hebdo

'For love of the prophet': Siraj-ul-Haq, chief of Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistan's main Islamic Party, said the thousands who protested in Paris after the Charlie Hebdo shootings were supporting 'Satan's agents'

Charlie Hebdo this month published a 'survivors' issue with an image of the Prophet Mohammed weeping on the cover, triggering a wave of angry condemnation and protest in Muslim-majority countries across the world.

Speaking at the Karachi protest, the chief of Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistan's main Islamic Party, demanded Pakistan call a meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, a group of Muslim countries. He urged the United Nations 'to curb the menace of blasphemy' through changes to international law.

'In Paris hundreds of thousands of people came onto the streets to support Satan's agents and in response to that hundreds and thousands of people have come out here on the streets for love of the prophet,' Siraj-ul-Haq said.

Another sizeable demonstration was held Sunday by Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), the charitable arm of the Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group which India accuses of the 2008 attacks on Mumbai that claimed 166 lives.

Police estimated that at least 12,000 people attended the JuD rally against Charlie Hebdo in Karachi.

JuD Chief Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, who is considered an abettor of Al-Qaeda by the UN, asked protesters not only to boycott French products but to refuse to buy all European imports in protest against the magazine.

JI also held an anti-Charlie Hebdo rally in front of the provincial legislature in Lahore - capital of Pakistan's politically influential and most populous province, Punjab - attended by some 5,000 people. A few hundred also turned out for a street protest in the southwestern city of Quetta.

Similar protests have been held across Asia since the publication of the latest provocative issue of Charlie Hebdo. Yesterday thousands took to the streets in Palestine and 1,500 in Senegal, but those numbers were dwarfed by mass protests across South Asia after Friday prayers last week/

Members of other faiths have also criticised Charlie Hebdo, with the head of Russia's Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, saying today the cartoons Mohammad were 'childish' compared to offences the magazine had dished out to Christians. 

His pronouncement came after Pope Francis likened mockery of religion to insulting someone's mother - and suggested that in both cases the mocker should expect a response.

Under Pakistan's strict blasphemy laws insulting the prophet can carry the death penalty, and the country's prime minister and parliament have strongly condemned the publication of the cartoons.

At least three people were injured on January 16 when protesters and police clashed at an anti-Charlie Hebdo demonstration outside the French consulate in Karachi.

They included AFP photographer Asif Hassan, who was shot in the back and is now recovering at home after being discharged from hospital.
