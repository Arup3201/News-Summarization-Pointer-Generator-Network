A Conservative MP has criticised the body responsible for overseeing politicians' expenses claims, claiming they are trying to 'screw MPs into the ground'.

Karl McCartney, the MP for Lincoln, says he has been forced to borrow £25,000 from his parents because of late payments by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) caused by delays in the processing of his expenses payments, a situation he claims that many other MPs face.

Mr McCartney also claims an Ipsa insider told him the body is purposefully hostile to politicians in an interview with BBC Radio 4.

He said: 'It was over £25,000 and that was by the August after we’d been elected in May.

'That sum of money is a huge sum of money and that was all the money that I'd had to spend out for whatever, for my staff, for staff salaries, and that was owed by Ipsa.

'Well my staff as well as myself have to live. We've got mortgages to pay, we've got families to look after and provide for.

'At the age of 42 I’m not proud of the fact I had to go to my mother and father and ask them if they could help me out because our credit cards, our loans at the bank were all maxed out and I wasn’t the only Member of Parliament that had to do that. Many Members of Parliament have had to do that, from all parties.'

He added that a senior Ipsa official had told him that staff at the watchdog were listening to friends who say they should 'screw MPs into the ground'.

'He basically said that he and his fellow senior management team at Ipsa, when they go to the pub on a Friday night and meet with their friends, their friends tell them that they should screw MPs into the ground and [he said] that’s what he was going to do,' Mr McCartney said.

The MP says he has been forced to borrow £25,000 from his parents because of the delay in reimbursing claims

In February the MP, who earns £65,738 a year, was forced to apologise to Ipsa for writing 'abusive and offensive' messages to its staff when making claims.

He told one official they were 'talking s****', and blasted another as a 'pedantic SOAB', slang for 'son of a b****'.

Mr McCartney said he regretted making the comments on claim forms but they were from sheer frustration because Ipsa was failing to pay MPs on time.

'Those comments came from the frustration of having to deal with an organisation that really is incompetent and certainly when we were first elected and there was a huge new number of MPs that were elected, but I found myself well into five figures – the money that I was owed by IPSA for over five months,' he said.

A spokesman for said Mr McCartney was making 'wild claims' that were untrue.

In January the Lincolnshire Echo reported that he doesn't think the current MP salary is enough after it emerged that MPs want a 32 per cent pay rise.

Mr McCartney said: 'This salary is far from consummate with the role that many MPs from all political sides dutifully undertake, and indeed there are a large number of allowances that MPs are able to claim, but do not, due no doubt to various pressures, particularly from an unreasonable and unrealistic media and certain sectors of the public.'
