A 25-year-old woman has become the fifth person in her family to be diagnosed with a devastating brain disease.

Kirsty Skinsley has Huntington’s disease – an inherited condition that damages the brain cells causing problems with movement, behaviour and cognition.

She is thought to be one of the youngest people in the UK diagnosed with the disease which usually develops in adulthood, after first suffering symptoms when she was 15.

Ms 
Skinsley, from Southport, Merseyside, said: ‘The doctors told me that it
 would be surprising if I had Huntington’s at such a young age.

Huntington's is an incurable disease caused by an inherited faulty gene, which produces a protein called Huntingtin.

It's not known how, but the gene causes widespread damage to the nerve cells in the brain, causing a range of symptoms.

Sufferers can exhibit emotional and mental changes such as mood swings, clumsiness, lack of motivation, aggression and depression which, in the early stages, can often be written off as simple personality traits.

Later, they develop physical problems such as the shakes or nervous tics, then weight loss and muscle weakness which leave the patient unable to swallow, speak or move.

Every sufferer has a different rate of deterioration, but it is a fatal condition.

On average, patients live for between 10 and 20 years after their diagnosis.

Huntington's disease is estimated to affect around 8,000 people in the UK.

In adults the symptoms usually appear between the ages of 35 and 50, although until a blood test was introduced around 20 years ago, it was very difficult to diagnose it at an early stage.

In rare cases, symptoms can start to develop in childhood.

To inherit the condition a child has to have just one parent who has it - if a person has the faulty gene, there is a 50 per cent chance each of their children will inherit it.

Sufferers are typically aged between 30 and 50 years old and each child whose parent has Huntington’s has a 50:50 chance of inheriting the faulty gene.

There
 is no way of slowing down or stopping the progression of the disease 
and sufferers usually get progressively worse for 10 to 20 years before 
eventually dying.

‘Becoming
 21 is a milestone and I didn’t want to go into the next stage of my 
life not knowing what lay in store for my future,’ Ms Skinsley said.

‘Although I knew that Huntington’s was on the horizon, doctors had said it was so unlikely I had it so young so I was surprised when they told me.

‘I was in denial for a long time as is expected with any terminal diagnosis and I didn’t want to open up to anyone about it.

‘Doctors told me they hadn’t dealt with someone with Huntington’s as young as me before.’

The former optician suffers from involuntary movements which are managed with medication and says she has good and bad days.

Her father, Brian, and brother, Liam have also been diagnosed with the condition, and the 25-year-old has already watched as the disease claimed the lives of her grandmother and aunt.

Her grandmother, Sarah Skinsley, died of the disease at 38, and her aunt, Paula Edwards, died at 42.

The future is uncertain for Ms Skinsley and she fears she will not be able to do everything her friends may experience in their lifetimes.

She said: ‘I see my mates getting mortgages and having babies and I do feel like I’m missing something.

‘I’d love to think I would get the family and marriage situation but I don’t know what the futures holds for me.

Ms Skinsley (pictured with her mother, Donna) experiences involuntary muscle movements and behavioural changes and knows the illness is progressive so wants to experience as much as possible now

‘I would like to think it will happen. There
 is treatment sort of like an IVF process now which ensures  genetically 
that the embryos they insert don’t have the condition, so I would do 
that.

‘I
 do get sad that I don’t have that normality that others have but I have
 amazing family and friends and I try my best to stay grounded and 
positive.’

She is determined not to succumb to her 
illness and has written a bucket list of things she wants to do before 
the disease worsens.

So far she wants to meet her idol Pink, do a parachute jump and have a dream holiday in Mexico to swim with dolphins.

She will also be cycling from Cornwall to Sheffield on June 9 to raise money for the Huntington’s Disease Association.
