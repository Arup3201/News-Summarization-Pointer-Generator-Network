She has become 'thinspiration' for women everywhere after shrinking from a size 20 to a svelte size eight.

And now former Big Brother winner and Bristol resident Josie Gibson is flaunting the body she has worked so hard to achieve.

Following the launch of her first fitness DVD (and several steamy lingerie shoots), the bubbly blonde has turned her hand to designing, releasing her debut collection of clothes for online fashion retailer Goddiva.... and modelling it all herself.

Showing off her hard work: Josie Gibson, who shot to fame on Big Brother, is showcasing her svelte new figure in her debut clothing line for Goddiva

Josie - who has just knocked Davina McCall off the top of the exercise video charts with her debut fitness DVD, 30 Second Slim - joined forces with the brand to create the Josie Gibson for Goddiva collection. a collection of glamorous evening-wear.

The 28-year-old was approached by Goddiva due to her entertaining, flirty personality, which they were keen to integrate into a new collection.

The team formed in mid-2012, before Josie's remarkable weight loss, when the label was keen to create a collection for 
women of all shapes and sizes.

Josie
follows in the footsteps of Made In Chelsea star Louise Thompson, whose 
two collections for the online retailer were a sell-out success, and the ex-BB housemate hopes her own range will be a similar hit.

Prints and maxis: The Josie Gibson for Goddiva collection combines Josie's love of fun prints, bodycon dresses and flattering maxis

The Josie Gibson for Goddiva collection combines Josie's love of fun prints, bodycon dresses and flattering maxis, making it an accessible collection for women of all ages and sizes.

From a fitted monochrome dress with bling embellishments, to a vibrant green number with a revealing cut out panel, Josie's collection of dresses are perfect for any glamorous night out.

Prices range from £42 to £55, and her dresses also include a trendy animal print dress reminiscent of Moschino's spring/summer 13 catwalk look.

The collaboration will see Josie interacting with fans and Goddiva customers with online competitions and giveaways, as well as providing weekly style advice, creating online links between her own website and Goddiva's.

In May 2012 Josie was horrified when she saw unflattering photographs of herself in a bikini on the beach, which led her to lose the excess pounds.

Not only did the TV personality lose a staggering amount of weight, she did it in record time, dropping three stone in three months - and a total of six stone in just one year.

A healthy new diet helped her slim down from 16st 7lb and a size 18 to 10st 2lb and a svelte size eight.

Big loser: Josie went from 16st 7lb and a size 18 to 10st 2lb and a svelte size 8, and what better way to show it off?
