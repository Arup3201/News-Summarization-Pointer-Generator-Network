A witness in the Ferguson shooting case found the phrase ‘Snitches get stitches’ when he googled his own name, it has been revealed.

The man, who has not been named, told of his fear of describing what happened on the day black teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri this summer.

His comments emerged after prosecutors released some 4,700 pages of reports following the grand jury’s decision not to indict the white officer.

The city was engulfed in serious civil unrest following the jury’s decision on Monday.

According to the Los Angeles Times, one of the witnesses told investigators he was scared black neighbours would question his description of what happened to Brown on August 9.

But he also feared being targeted by white supremacists who might accuse him of harming Wilson’s case.

The Los Angeles Times reports him as telling investigators: ‘I do think of the Ku Klux Klan. I do.’ He is also said to have searched his own name on the internet and found the phrase ‘Snitches get stitches’.

Another witness was so concerned about the potential reaction to giving evidence that he did not speak to police until nearly two weeks after Brown’s death, reports the Los Angeles Times, which says some peopele 'wrestled with the fallout' of having seen the incident. 

The witness is quoted as testifying: ‘You never know how people react to certain things.’

The grand jury heard from Dorian Johnson, the website reports, who was next to Brown when Wilson arrived on the scene and who fled when shots were fired.

Revealing his fears about speaking to police, he is quoted as saying: ‘I was so afraid, I didn't know what was going to happen to me.

‘I basically just didn't, really didn't feel comfortable with Ferguson at the time.’  

Violence flared after the decision was announced by St Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch at around 8:25pm on Monday evening, and continued throughout the evening and into early Tuesday morning.

As President Barack Obama appeared on television to appeal for calm, angry crowds took to the streets after the grand jury determined there was no probable cause to charge the officer with any crime for the shooting. 

People have started cleaning up the battered community as scattered demonstrations continued on Wednesday.
