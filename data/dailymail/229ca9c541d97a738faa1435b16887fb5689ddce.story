At barely a couple of metres wide, this ramshackle home looks like a contender for the title of narrowest house in Britain.

It sprung up in between two more solidly constructed houses in Leyton, east London, a month ago, leaving locals wondering who was behind it.

Now Waltham Forest Council is investigating the house, which is believed not to have planning permission, and is expected to order it to be torn down imminently.

The makeshift house has sprung up in Manor Road, Leyton, in the past month, leaving neighbours puzzled

The wooden house began to be built a month ago, apparently without planning permission

The wooden house, covered in plywood and lacking any obvious roof, fills a gap that used to house a dilapidated shed in the residential street.

The plywood construction hides what used to be a dilapidated shed

Neighbours in Manor Road, who said there was a garage there before the shed, say they have not noticed anyone living at the newly-sprung up house while construction work goes on.

IT consultant Esther Regenwetter, 41, who has lived in Manor Road for 15 years, said: 'For a long time it was a horrible shed, not even a garage.

'They seem to have put this bizarre front on it, but what was there before was really, really horrible. I don’t have anything against it.'

But one woman in her 70s who lives next door said: 'You’re going to have to be quite thin to live in there.'

Waltham Forest council said: 'We are investigating and will take appropriate action.'

Narrow houses, when built legally and with planning permission, can be a useful solution to Britain's housing crisis.

The
Wedge house, in Millport on the Island of Great Cumbrae in Scotland is 
believed to have the narrowest front of any house in the world, 
measuring just under 4ft (1.19m) across at its narrowest point.

The
house, which was sold by owners George and June Allison in 2001, boasts
a kitchen/sitting room downstairs and a bedroom and shower-room 
upstairs.

A house in the 
Hollingdean area of Brighton measuring 6ft wide is another home where 
you may not be able to swing a cat - the owners installed a wooden 
ladder instead of stairs and said it was so narrow they didn't need to 
heat it as it was heated by its neighbours either side.
