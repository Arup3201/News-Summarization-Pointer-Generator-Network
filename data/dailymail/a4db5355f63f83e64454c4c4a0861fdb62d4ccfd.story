FIFA president Sepp Blatter admitted he was ‘surprised’ to see Lionel Messi win the World Cup player of the tournament.

Messi, who scored four goals, was below par in the semi-final victory over Holland in the semi-final and in Sunday night's final against Germany.

Messi even looked embarrassed at the Maracana to collect the award after Germany’s fourth tournament triumph.

Blatter said: ‘I was a bit surprised when I saw Messi getting the best player of the tournament. If you compare the beginning of the tournament and why the team of Argentina got to the final then look at the decisive goals he scored. 

'If you compare the beginning of the 
tournament and why finally the Argentina team got into the final, they 
were decisive and I think it was a decision (based on that),' Blatter 
added.

Diego Maradona won 
the same accolade as Messi in 1986, but, unlike his compatriot, he left 
the tournament with a World Cup winners' medal around his neck.

The outspoken former Argentina skipper feels Messi did not deserve to win the award.

'I would give heaven and earth to Leo, but when marketing people want him to win something he didn't (deserve to) win, it is unfair,' Maradona said.

'I could see that he didn't want to go up and collect it (the award).'

A spokesman for FIFA said: ‘The decision to give Messi the award was made by the technical group.’
