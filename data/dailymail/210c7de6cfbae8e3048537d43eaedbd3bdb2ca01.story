Parents of a two-year-old girl have been slapped with a police warning after CCTV caught the infant venturing out alone at night to buy candy from a Detroit-area gas station.

Surveillance footage shows the toddler crossing the dark forecourt of Citgo on Hamilton Avenue around 11pm in boots and a bright coat before pulling open the door and wandering around inside. 

Another customer can be seen glancing over at her.

Mohamad Bazzi, who runs the convenience store, told Inside Edition that he was shocked when the youngster came in unaccompanied and put two pennies on the counter in a bid to get some treats.  

Caught on camera: Parents of a two-year-old girl have been slapped with a police warning after CCTV caught the infant venturing out alone at night to buy candy from a Detroit-area gas station.

The businessman swiftly called 911 and officers from Highland Park Police Station came to collect the tearful little girl before tracking down her parents.

They apparently lived over the road from the gas station and failed to notice the toddler leave home. 

About an hour after the girl was taken into custody, her family went to collect her.

Footage shows them being shouted at by Chief Kevin Coney, who criticized their laissez-faire attitude.

'There's a [two]-year-old girl walking across the street at night to a gas station fully-dressed and you come in  like, "so what?"' 

Spotted: Another customer can be seen glancing over at her

Dangerous crossing: Inside Edition's Les Trent noted that the incident could have proved tragic

Things that go bump in the night: He was filmed crossing the same busy road as the little girl, struggling to navigate the dimly lit stretch of tarmac

Store owner Bazzi says he's glad the girl was okay. 

He added that she seemed distressed and was crying when he waited with her for police to arrive.

Inside Edition anchor Les Trent noted that  the incident could have proved tragic.

He was filmed crossing the same busy road as the little girl, struggling to navigate the dimly lit stretch of tarmac.

On top of that the area is also known for having a high crime rate.

Two years ago there was a fatal shooting at Bazzi's gas station where one of his employees was killed by an armed robber.
