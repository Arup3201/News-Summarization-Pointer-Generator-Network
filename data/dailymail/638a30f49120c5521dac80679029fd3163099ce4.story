Joe Jackson has vowed to make Michael Jackson’s son Blanket into a star as big as his father - so long as he is ‘trained’ properly.

The 75-year-old family patriarch said that he disagreed with those who said there would never be another King of Pop because Blanket was ready to take his place.

He said that the 11-year-old is the ‘spitting image’ of Michael at that age and revealed that he believed a fortune teller who once predicted Blanket would be a sensation.

Prospects: Blanket Jackson is ready to become the next King of Pop, according to Michael's father Joe

Joe’s comments evoked memories of how he pushed Michael and his brothers into show business and ruled the family with an iron fist.

He has in the past admitted to beating his children with a strap but was unapologetic and claimed that it ‘kept them out of jail and kept them right.’

The physical and emotional abuse supposedly went on for years and friends of Michael’s have said that he was never able to forgive his father.

Joe made his comments in a forthcoming documentary about Michael’s children in which Blanket speaks on camera for the first time.

Prince Michael, 16, and Paris, 15, also talk frankly about the impact of the death of their father in 2009 at the age of 50 as he prepared to mount a comeback.

In the documentary Joe said: ‘They said there would never be another Michael Jackson and I say that we already have one. But I said he just has to be trained.

‘That kid is the spitting image of Michael when he was smaller.’

Speaking of the fortune teller, he said: ‘She said that boy there is going to be the biggest entertainer in the world.’

The documentary is called Remembering Michael and was made by Michael’s mother Katherine, 83, the legal co-guardian of his children.

In extracts already made public Paris breaks down in tears as she says of her father: ‘He promised he would teach me how to moonwalk, but he never got round to it.’

She also opens up about how her grief led her to attempt suicide in June and says her life was so secluded she did not even know her father’s name until she was six.

The reason was that he wanted his children to know him as ‘Daddy’ and not a celebrity.

In his interview Blanket says that some of his earliest memories are going into his father’s room and watching videos of him dancing.
