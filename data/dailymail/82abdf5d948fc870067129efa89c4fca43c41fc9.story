The motto of motivational speaker Emmanuel Gobillot is: There must be a better way.

It’s a thought that licence-fee payers might echo after the BBC spent a reported £75,000 to hire his services – and several teepees – for a ‘festival-style’ event to boost staff morale.

At a time when BBC budgets are being squeezed, some of the 300 employees invited to spend a day in the sunshine described it as ‘pointless’ and an ‘utter waste’ of money.

The BBC People Conference, which took place at the corporation’s premises in Caversham, Berkshire, is believed to have been organised by its Human Resources department.

Even Mr Gobillot, one of Europe’s most sought-after leadership speakers, was moved to describe his day on Wednesday as being on a par with the Glastonbury music festival.

He wrote on Twitter: ‘Speaking in a pyramid-shaped tent in the middle of a park today. Very Glastonbury (although the sun is shining)!’

He added: ‘Sharing a stage with Jo Willey [DJ Jo Whiley] in a tent at the BBC. I feel like a Glastonbury act!’

But a BBC insider said: ‘While we have big spaces in the BBC at no cost, they decided to hire teepees for the garden.

‘The content was quite light and the whole thing was quite pointless, though there was a bar and barbecue after.’

The insider claimed the event cost £75,000, adding: ‘Programme areas are suffering with a lack of budgets – this was an utter waste.’

Last night the BBC said meetings of this scale were held every 18 months, but said the costs were far less than £75,000.

A spokesman said: ‘A marquee was the most cost-effective option because there are no internal meeting areas of sufficient size.

To maximise value the marquee was used to host two careers skills events for local schools and universities later in the week.’
