The University of Maryland is investigating a fraternity member who allegedly sent a racist email that also talked about raping women.

A member of Kappa Sigma's chapter at the College Park school was suspended from the fraternity after the organization learned about the incident and he later resigned.

The student sent the email, which insulted and used racial slurs for black, Indian and Asian women, to six people in January last year.

The frat member said that students of the races should not come to their parties for 'Rush week,' when new brothers are recruited.

The author also denounces getting consent for sexual activity when speaking about women in the email.

University president Wallace Loh released a statement saying, 'The vulgar language in the email expresses views that are reprehensible to our campus community'.

The institution's Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct is conducting an investigation into the student, who has met with school officials.

Loh said that the university only learned about the email on Tuesday and that Kappa Sigma has asked for diversity and respect training from the university for its members. 

The fraternity has suspended the student, who also later resigned, following racist statements against black, Indian and Asian women.

The investigation comes shortly after the University of Oklahoma's Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter was closed down after a video emerged of frat members singing racist chants on a bus.

Two members from Texas, Parker Rice and Levi Pettit, were expelled from the university for leading the songs, which talked about lynching black people. 

Officials at University of Texas at Austin are looking into the possibility that members of the fraternity's chapter at their school also used the chant, according to the Los Angeles Times. 

There is also an investigations into Sigma Alpha Epsilon at Louisiana Tech and a chapter of the fraternity at University of Washington that has been accused of calling black students 'apes' and not allowing them into parties.

School officials' acknowledgement of the email came a day after officials at another University System of Maryland campus confirmed they had expelled two students for code-of-conduct violations. 

The discipline followed an investigation into sexual assault allegations at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. 

The student under investigation also allegedly talked about raping women in his email about his fraternity's parties
