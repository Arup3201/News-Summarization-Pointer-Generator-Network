Newcastle United fought back before eventually clinging on to edge Everton 3-2 in a thrilling festive encounter at St James' Park.

Arouna Kone opened the scoring for the visitors after only five minutes before man of the match Papiss Cisse and Ayoze Perez clawed back a first half lead.

Jack Colback appeared to have sealed victory for the Magpies after the interval, but a late strike from substitute Kevin Mirallas set up a tense finish.

NEWCASTLE UNITED (4-2-3-1) 

Alnwick: Newcastle’s makeshift goalkeeper. Not at fault for Kone’s point-blank opener and made brilliant one-handed save to deny Coleman later despite offside flag. Could not stop Mirallas’s fine finish late on - 6.5

Janmaat: Got forward frequently and chose short passes well. Tidy one-twos in attack down right wing had Everton in circles during second half. Lost Mirallas for late Everton surge, though - 6.5

Coloccini (c): Allowed Kone to get in front for simple finish early on but often Newcastle’s last man, leading from the back. Never gave Kone and Lukaku an inch after taking lead - 7

Williamson: Newcastle have not won a game this year in which Gouffran and Williamson have appeared together, but got rid of that unwanted statistic by setting up Cisse’s equaliser with cute cut-back assist - 7

Dummett: Missing at left back when Gouffran was undone for Coleman’s cross and Kone’s goal. Thankfully for him did not cost them in the end. Got more comfortable as game grew old - 6

Perez: Few poor crosses and lacked silky touches in first half. Made up for it with composed finish in bottom-left corner after the break and was sharp in attack in later stages - 7

Sissoko: Was one-on-one to equalise but fluffed lines with poor first touch. Much improved in second half and was dangerous whenever in attack as Newcastle looked to seal win - 7

Tiote: Returned from suspension and did nothing wrong, though largely went unnoticed in centre of pitch. Thankless job - 6.5

Colback: Won the physical battle in midfield more often than not. Worked hard as per and was alert to punish Barkley’s defensive error and confirm win for Newcastle - 7.5

Gouffran (replaced by Cabella 90): Undone by a McGeady through ball on his inside for Everton’s opening goal after five minutes. Didn’t convince as much as his team-mates in this win - 6

Cisse (replaced by Riviere 73): Lucky to escape red for elbow on Coleman. Right place at right time for well-taken equaliser. Always a danger and deserved standing ovation. Now scored as many Premier League goals in last six appearances as he had in previous 17 - 8

Substitutions:

Riviere (on for Cisse 73): Decent in closing stages as Newcastle looked to seal win. Fresh legs for Pardew - 6

Manager:

Alan Pardew: Had his side play the short game well and controlled possession. An important win to those doubting his ability as manager - 8

EVERTON (4-4-1-1)

Robles: No chance of saving Cisse’s close range equaliser or Perez’s winner. Few questionable moves, giving away the odd needless corner as he filled in for Tim Howard - 5.5

Coleman: A perfectly-whipped cross from the right for Kone’s opening goal. Roughed up by Cisse and Co but took it in his stride. Unlucky to be on losing team - 6.5

Distin: Age catching up to the 37-year-old. Careless passing at times as he manned the back. Lost his man too often - 5.5

Alcaraz: Out of his depth at times. He and Distin did not look adequate at the back for Martinez - 5.5 

Everton defender Seamus Coleman (left) lunges in to prevent Cisse taking the ball

Garbutt: First Premier League start and was composed on the ball. Looked good getting forward but ultimately on losing side - 6

Baines: Largely anonymous in first half but chased the ball well to make Newcastle uncomfortable. Fine ball through for Mirallas’ goal which gave visitors hope in final moments - 6

Barry: Most booked player in Premier League history with 100. Not today. Was well disciplined in Everton engine room but lost physical battles - 5.5

McCarthy (replaced by Barkley, 45): Workhorse as per, closing down Newcastle when home side were in possession. Substituted at half time for Barkley - 6

McGeady (replaced by Mirallas, 61): His ball inside allowed Coleman to cross for the opening goal. Sacrificed for Mirallas after 61 minutes. Looked frustrated to come off - 6

Eto’o: Looked dangerous and wanted to get on ball plenty in role behind Kone. Once he got his chance after 63 minutes, however, he fluffed lines by sending shot well over crossbar - 6

Kone (replaced by Lukaku 71): Got Everton on their way with a well-taken goal in his first Premier League start. Worked hard and chased the ball well - 7 

Ross Barkley's (right) mistake allowed Colback to score what was eventually the winner

Substitutions:

Barkley (on for McCarthy, 45): Scored in both Premier League appearances against Newcastle but not this time as a half time substitute. His mistake led to Colback goal, which confirmed Everton’s defeat - 5

Mirallas (on for McGeady, 61): Gave Everton hope with goal in 84th minute. Composed finish under pressure from approaching goalkeeper Alnwick - 6.5

Lukaku (on for Kone 71): Too little, too late to have an impact - 6

Arouna Kone (centre) opened the scoring or Everton after only five minutes

Manager:

Roberto Martinez: Made seven changes and heavily rotated team. Lost the passing game and looked a hurried formation at times - 6

Referee:

Craig Pawson: Should have sent Cisse off for elbow on Coleman before striker scored Newcastle’s equaliser three minutes later - 5
