As one of the most expensive properties in Scotland, this sprawling 112-room castle might not look like a typical bargain buy.

But this 300-estate is set to go for a knock-down price after its owner put it on the market for £5million - £1.5million less than it cost to buy and renovate.

Kate Armstrong, the founder of price comparison website Confused.com, bought Cassillis House near Maybole, Ayrshire, in 2009 for £3million, before spending millions of pounds - and the next four years - on giving the neglected property a 21st-century makeover.

Bargain: The sprawling Cassillis House, pictured, is set on a 300-acre estate near Maybole in Ayrshire. The new buyer will own four other properties on the land

Carefully restored: The kitchen features wood cabinets which are complimented by modern lighting fixtures. Mrs Armstrong spent four years renovating the property

Authentic: An intricate doorway hints at the castle's history, left, while a carefully restored spiral staircase adds a touch of medieval grandeur to the property, right

Spacious: The castle boasts 13 bedrooms, seven of which are luxurious en-suites. This bathroom features a free-standing roll-top bath and elegant shower

The mammoth four-year project was last year featured in the BBC2 programme Restoration Home, which is presented by Caroline Quentin.

But the Australian tycoon and her family have not been able to spend as much time at the medieval castle as they had hoped. They have now put the historic property up for sale for a knock-down five million pounds.

Mrs Armstrong has previously stated that the project had been a labour of love and the sale price is designed to attract a quick buyer who will take care of the building in the future.

Cassillis House boasts 13 bedrooms, seven of which have luxurious en-suites, a ballroom, library, wine cellar, cinema room, and space for a gym.

And for the £5million asking price, the buyer will also own four other properties on the estate including a five-bed coach house.

The castle, which was built between 1404 and 1454, had been neglected for many years before Mrs Armstrong bought it, and had problems including rot to the roofs and damage to ornate design work.

Bright and airy: Mrs Armstrong was careful to make sure the castle retained its traditional feel by choosing subdued colours for the walls and restoring original features

Grand: Vast windows flood the rooms with natural light, while imposing doorways add character to the 122-room home

Exquisite: The sprawling gardens can be seen stretching out into the distance from the windows of this room, where a fireplace is the centrepiece

The restoration project saw many historical features retained including a
 15th century staircase and a two-storey front dating between 1830 and 
1832. Mrs Armstrong worked with Historic Scotland on it and had the castle painted yellow, which would have been the original colour.

Cassilis is being sold by estate agents Savills.

Evelyn Channing, of 
Savills, said: 'Someone has gone through the pain of a complete 
restoration and it’s now ready for 21st century living.

'Normally there is some sort of project but this is ready to go, and it has such amazing history.

Regal: Rich red curtains and carpets add warmth to this grand room, which features painted exposed beams on the ceiling

Calming: Soft blues and greens on wall panels compliment a sea scene painted above the doorway in this room that is flooded with natural light

Country retreat: History appears to come alive in this room, where an unusual stone and wood ceiling and deep red walls dominate the space

'That
 building has been standing there since the 13th century and you can 
just imagine everything it has witnessed over the generations.

'Many 
ancient interesting features have been retained such as the tower and a 
bedroom that was discovered when they pulled away some of the plaster.

'Although it’s on the market for five million pounds this is still one of the most expensive properties in Scotland. If it went up for an unrealistic level it would get no interest.

'It
 is on the market for less than what [Mrs Armstrong] has spent on it. She is not asking for all her money back. She is more concerned 
about making sure the castle is being looked after.'

Bathing in blue: Mrs Armstrong made the most of the space in this room by building in a window seat. She said she wanted to make sure the property was going to a good owner

Modern comforts: The 13-bedroom castle boasts a cinema room, complete with a tartan carpet, a ballroom, wine cellar - and has space for a gym

Bonus: In addition to the main house, the new buyer will own the four other properties on the estate, including a five-bedroom coach house and a stables cottage

Cassillis was built between 1404 and 1454 and was owned by the Kennedy family from the 15th century until 2009, after the last descendent, Mary, Marchioness of Ailsa, died.

And the estate comes with its own colourful - and slightly morbid - history. David Kennedy, the 1st Earl of Cassillis, was killed at the Battle of Flodden, while the second Earl was murdered following an unsuccessful attempt to rescue James V.

The third Earl was poisoned in France while attending the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots.
