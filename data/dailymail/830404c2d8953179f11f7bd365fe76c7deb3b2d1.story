Ouch: Binge drinking costs more than just a hangover. The CDC says it costs more than $223.5billion a year

A shocking new government study claims that excessive drinking costs the nation more than $223.5billion a year in health care, lost productivity, crime and early death - and most of the burden is carried by taxpayers.

The research, released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control, finds that binge drinking, alcoholism and alcohol abuse is dragging millions - and sometimes billions - of dollars from the economies of every state in the country.

The health and productivity losses mean that for every cocktail, pint of beer or glass of wine consumed, American society must pay nearly $2 in additional costs.

The nation's capital, which has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption in the country according to CDC figures, pays the most. Washington DC residents consumed more than 680 drinks each in 2006 - the year that the study surveyed.

Those drinks cost out more than $966billion in ancillary healthcare bills and productivity losses as a result - more than $1,660 per resident of the city.

Utah, where strong influence from the Mormon church means alcohol is heavily regulated, has the lowest rates of alcohol consumption and - as a result - the lowest costs. Utah residents consumed fewer than 200 drinks each in 2006 and paid just $578 per capita.

The shocking figure of $223.5billion is larger than the economies of Ireland and Pakistan. Researchers say it should serve as a wake-up call that the country needs to curb its drinking habit.

'Excessive alcohol use has devastating impacts on individuals, families, communities, and the economy,' CDC Director Dr Tom Frieden said in a statement.

'In addition to injury, illness, disease, and death, it costs our society billions of dollars through reduced work productivity, increased criminal justice expenses, and higher healthcare costs.

'Effective prevention programs can support people in making wise choices about drinking alcohol.'

About 42 percent of the cost of heavy drinking was paid by state or federal funds - whether through Medicare and Medicaid or byÂ  other government services. That amounted to the largest share of the cost - and less than the cost paid by heavy drinkers and their families.

Some 70percent of the costs of excessive alcohol use was incurred by binge drinkers - those who consume five or more drinks in a single sitting.

Authors of the study cautioned that the data doesn't include drinkers whose productivity at work is hampered by hangovers.

A MailOnline analysis of CDC data shows that New Hampshire had the highest rates of alcohol consumption, with 736 drinks purchased per capita in 2006. Washington, DC, and Nevada were the next highest.

However, the CDC points out that in New Hampshire many of the package liquor buyers come from other states and in Nevada - home to Sin City - much of the state's alcohol consumption can be attributed to tourists.

The lowest per capita alcohol consumption was in Utah, Oklahoma and Arkansas.

The study will be published in the October issue of the American Journal of Preventative Medicine.
