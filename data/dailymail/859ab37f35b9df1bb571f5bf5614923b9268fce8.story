The new shoes you’ve been hankering after have been ordered and paid for at the click of a mouse – but you’re never in when the delivery man calls.

Soon you’ll be able to pop down the road after work and pick up your prized  purchase... from the newsagent.

Shoppers will be given the chance to use corner shops or petrol stations to collect goods they ordered online as part of a new service by John Lewis.

John Lewis department store has announce shoppers will now be able to return items bought from the store to thousands of local newsagents and petrol stations

Customers can also return unwanted or faulty clothes, shoes and accessories using a network of 5,000 outlets across the country.

From the autumn, the department store chain will give the ultra-local click and collect scheme a trial run in Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of south-west England, charging just £3 for a pick-up. Sending back goods is free.

The scheme, run by CollectPlus, adds to the group’s existing service in which online goods can be collected at 234 points at stores, ‘at home’ sites and branches of Waitrose.

Karen Dracou of John Lewis said: ‘Orders using click and collect have nearly doubled over the past year, and accounted for an impressive 35 per cent of online sales over the Christmas period, so we know that customers are looking for ever-more convenient ways of shopping with us.’

Stores in the CollectPlus network will be able to accept returned John Lewis items, free of charge

Using stores that stay open late at night will benefit those who work during the day, says the company.

The service also offers pick-up points that are generally closer to homes than post offices.

More than 85 per cent of town-dwellers live within a mile of a CollectPlus store, while 70 per cent say they would be unwilling to travel more than five miles to  collect goods ordered online.

The move may add to worries that traditional high streets are withering under the growth of internet shopping.

However, the stores used by CollectPlus could benefit from the link because customers may buy other items while they are claiming their packages.

CollectPlus already operates click 
and collect partnerships with other big brands, including House of 
Fraser, Evans, Dorothy Perkins, eBay, Karen Millen, Monsoon and 
Accessorize.

More
than 85 per cent of people in towns in the UK live within a mile of a 
CollectPlus store, while seven in 10 say they would not be willing to 
travel more than five miles to collect goods ordered online.

The
CollectPlus chief executive, Neil Ashworth, said: ‘We’ve designed the 
service to ensure that customers find collecting and returning items as 
easy and as painless as possible.

‘The extended opening hours 
associated with all CollectPlus stores allow customers to drop off or 
return items outside of the traditional trading day.’

John
Lewis’s focus on developing its web store has been central to the 
group’ s growth in sales at a time when much of the rest of the high 
street is in crisis.

Its
head of omnichannel, Karen Dracou, said: ‘Orders using Click & 
Collect have nearly doubled over the past year, and accounted for an 
impressive 35per cent of online sales over the Christmas period, so we 
know that customers are looking for ever-more convenient ways of 
shopping with us.

‘By
partnering with CollectPlus, we can extend our existing reach of John 
Lewis and Waitrose collection points to a wider geographical base, 
providing an even more convenient way for our customers to shop.’
