A repair job turned into a rescue mission when a crane buckled and collapsed into the water below.

The fall was caught on camera as the crane appeared to get caught in power lines above Alsea Bay, western Oregon, Portland, as it moved a replacement metal tower into position.

The operator was unable to untangle the crane from the 69-kilovolt lines, which had been turned off.

The drama unfolded as the crane replaced support towers in Alsea Bay in western Oregon

First the crane buckled then it took the metal tower down with it.

Fortunately, the crane operator walked away uninjured, though perhaps a little wet.

The
crane was being used as part of a project to replace wooden structures 
holding up high voltage power lines across the bay, according to a 
Central Lincoln Public Utilities District spokeswoman.

The collapse was filmed by Port of Alsea commissioner Rob Bishop.Â 

The camera was filming as it became clear the crane was caught in overhead power lines above the water. It then began to buckle

The crane began to fall towards the water while the operator below could only stay put

As the crane headed south, it pulled the support tower it was trying to position down with it

The replacement metal support 
structures that fell into the water have a combined weight of 14 tons, 
according to CraneAccidents.com.

Work at Alsea Bay resumed last Thursday, two days after the accident, with the arrival of a new crane.

The
new line support towers should last for up to 80 years once they are in
place and should be able to withstand gusts of up to 130mph.

The operator was unharmed in the accident but possibly got a bit of a soaking as the crane hit the water
