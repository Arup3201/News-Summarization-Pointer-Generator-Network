Jordan Daly, 16, from Innerleithen,  suffers from severe hereditary multiple exostoses (HME) which causes painful bone tumours to grow over her body

Like most 16-year-old girls, Jordan Daly loves make-up and painting her nails.

But behind the pretty exterior lies a gruelling daily fight against a rare and painful condition.

Jordan suffers from severe hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), which causes agonising bone tumours to grow all over her body.

The hook-shaped growths can form at the end of any bone or joint, which then dig in to the muscles and tendons, causing constant pain she likens to a knife wound. There is no cure for the genetic condition and the slightest knock can trigger a growth.

With dozens of thumb-sized tumours on her shoulders, arms, legs, knees, and feet, even getting up from a chair, eating and breathing can be excruciating.

To add to her pain, pupils at her school bullied her with cruel jibes of ‘freak’ and ‘squint legs’.

From as young as seven she was targeted by bullies who taunted her about her illness and her surgical scars where bone had been removed, and even beat her up.

Now the teenager, who is studying for her Higher English at home as she is too weak to attend school, has written a blog about growing up with HME in an attempt to let other youngsters see that it is acceptable to be different.

Jordan, from Innerleithen, Peeblesshire, who has endured years of surgery to remove the bony lumps, said: ‘When young children don’t understand something, they either ignore it or hurt it.

'It was awful at the time because I didn’t understand why they were so against me. I ended up starving myself as a way of punishing myself because after a while you actually start to believe that you’re not worth it.’ 

Jordan, pictured on her first birthday, was four when her parents first spotted a lump on one of her joints. She has since developed dozens more boney growths

Jordan was four when her parents, Gordon and Sheila, first noticed a lump on one of her joints. A year later she had her first operation to remove the bony growth.

Since then she has developed dozens more, many of which have regrown even after surgery. A knock to her arm or leg is enough to cause a growth to appear.

They can also cause her hips and knee joints to lock, leaving her in severe pain and immobile.

She also suffers from Von Willebrand disease, where her blood does not clot properly. This means she bruises easily and every operation is a risk.

Jordan is in so much pain even taking her little brother, Logan, five, the five-minute walk to school can be a challenge.

Outlet: Jordan has now started a blog about her experience

She said: ‘Sometimes even moving from a chair is quite difficult due to the pain. It’s excruciating when I breathe in and sometimes when I wake up I can’t breathe because the spurs cause the muscles and tendons to tighten.’

Despite her pain, she wants to help other children bullied for their differences realise they are not alone. In her blog, Jordan urges them to read her story and realise things are not as bad as they seem.

She said: ‘I want other children to see they don’t have to put up walls. Even though some people will be cruel, not all will be. They need to have faith in themselves and not let people bring them down.’

Her mother, an account manager, said: ‘She’s a walking miracle. She was born nine weeks early. She died twice and had to be ventilated and we were told she would probably never walk or talk.’
