The Bank of England's chief economist has said interest rates are likely to remain ‘lower for longer’ as the ‘jobs-rich and pay-poor’ recovery from the Great Recession slows.

Andy Haldane said he was concerned about the outlook for the economy because of weaker global growth, low pay rises and political and financial risks.

But his comments were in contrast to the Bank of England's self-confessed rebel Martin Weale who has voted against the majority to increase increase rates.  

Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane said: 'Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomier'

Mr Haldane told business leaders during a speech in Kenilworth, Warwickshire: ‘Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomier.

‘Interest rates could remain lower for longer, certainly than I had expected three months ago.’

Then, Mr Haldane had said the Bank should ‘play off the front foot’ and raise rates sooner rather than later.

‘The statistics now appear to favour the back foot,’ he said yesterday.

‘That was three months ago, the weather was warm…the weather’s got cooler.’

He suggested rates will stay static until after the General Election in May. ‘Who knows precisely when the lift-off date will come,’ he added.

He said the economy is ‘writhing in both agony and ecstasy’ as increases in output and employment are offset by weak wage growth and productivity.

‘This has been a jobs-rich but pay-poor recovery,’ he said. 

Rates have not risen since July 2007 and have been at 0.5 per cent since March 2009, in a boost to millions of borrowers who have enjoyed record low mortgage costs.

However, the prolonged period of ultra-low rates has hammered savers who have been forced to accept paltry returns. 

Trade-off: The low rates have benefited those with mortgages - but those with savings have taken the hit

The stronger-than-expected recovery over the last 18 months and sharp falls in unemployment, which at 6 per cent is now at its lowest level for nearly six years, sparked speculation that rates could rise before the end of this year or early next year.

But the deepening crisis in the Eurozone and worries about the global economy are now seen as a threat to the UK – prompting analysts and investors to push their expectations of when rates will rise back to after the election.

Official figures this week showed inflation fell to 1.2 per cent in September – its lowest level for five years and well below the 2 per cent target – giving the Bank leeway to leave rates low for longer.

Two members of the nine-strong monetary policy committee that sets rates have already started calling for an increase but they have been outvoted by the other seven.

Self-confessed rebel Martin Weale, the Bank of England policymaker, has voted for the past two months to raise interest rates and believes now is the time to tighten monetary policy 

Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member Martin Weale argues that it is not the current rate we should be concerned about, but what's in store for prices in two to three years' time. 

He pointed out that two of the big factors behind the recent decline - falling oil prices and the strong pound - are driven by forces beyond the Bank's control.

Mr Weale said the MPC needs to do more work on assessing the impact of the strong pound in the first half of the year, which is estimated to have pushed down the headline inflation rate by 0.5 percentage points. 

He says divergent monetary policies in the UK, US and eurozone will also play a role. 

He maintains that waiting too long to raise rates increases the risk that they will have to go up more sharply to keep a lid on inflation.

He told the Telegraph: 'As far as I can see, if I were to wait until all the downside risks went away, then I think I could be confident that I'd waited for too long.'  

Dr Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: ‘We have put back our expectation of the first interest rate hike from February to mid-2015.

‘With earnings growth currently still weak, inflation down and likely to go lower still in the near term, and with global growth concerns particularly the weakness in the eurozone posing an increased downside risk to the UK growth outlook, we suspect that the majority of MPC members will prefer to err on the side of caution in raising interest rates.’

He said he expects rates to rise to 1 per cent by the end of 2015, to 2 per cent by the end of 2016 and to 3 per cent by the end of 2017.
