This little pig certainly did cry 'weeee, all the way home' as he went for an unintentional spin on the ice.

Ricky Phillip Gindlesberger from Washington, Pennsylvania, captured his pet porker performing the stunt on a frozen stretch of walkway. 

The animal, named Phinny, is seen scrabbling to stay upright before he slides along on his bottom and two front trotters.

As he gathers speed, he rolls around on his belly.

'Oh, I got you,'  Gindlesberger says as he cuts the video to rescue Phinny.

The pet owner later uploaded a photograph to Facebook showing his pig safe from harm.

'Phinny has been cuddled up by the heater all day! No more ice sliding!' Gindlesberger reassured concerned viewers.

He says the footage serves as a reminder to be careful out in icy weather.

'Ice everywhere, poor Phinny couldn't even make it to the grass!' he added.

Weee: This is the moment a pig took an unintentional spin on the ice
