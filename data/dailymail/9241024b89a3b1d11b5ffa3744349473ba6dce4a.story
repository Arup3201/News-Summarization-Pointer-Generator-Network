Alexander the Great built a legendary empire before his untimely - and mysterious - death at the age of just 32 in 323 BC.

Some historians argued was death was due to natural causes, while others maintained he was secretly murdered at a celebratory banquet.

Now, an Otago University scientist may have unraveled the case some 2000 years later.

National Poisons Centre toxicologist Dr Leo Schep thinks the culprit could be poisonous wine made from an innocuous-looking plant, according to a report inÂ  the New Zealand Herald.

Death by wine? New findings, which are ten years in the making, suggest that Alexander the Great died from drinking wine that was tainted with a seemingly innocuous plant called hellebore

Pretty but deadly: Veratrum album, known as white hellebore, is a plant that, once fermented properly, can be lethal

Dr Schep, who has been researching the toxicological evidence for a decade, said some of the poisoning theories - including arsenic and strychnine - were not plausible.

Death would have come far too fast, he said.

His research, co-authored by Otago University classics expert Dr Pat Wheatley and published in the medical journal Clinical Toxicology, found the most plausible culprit was Veratrum album, known as white hellebore.

The white-flowered plant, which can be fermented into a poisonous wine, was well-known to the Greeks as a herbal treatment for inducing vomiting.

Crucially, it could have accounted for the 12 torturous days that Alexander took to die, speechless and unable to walk.

The new theory behind the death of Alexander the Great started here, at the University of Otago in New Zealand

Other suggested poisons - including hemlock, aconite, wormwood, henbane and autumn crocus - would likely have killed him far more quickly.

Dr Schep began looking into the mystery in 2003 when he was approached by a company working on a BBC documentary.

'They asked me to look into it for them and I said, 'Oh yeah, I'll give it a go, I like a challenge' - thinking I wasn't going to find anything,' he said.

'And to my utter surprise, and their surprise, we found something that could fit the bill.'

Dr Schep's theory was that Veratrum album could have been fermented as a wine that was given to the leader.

Dr Leo Schep, toxicologist at the National Poisons Centre and scientist at the Otago University in New Zealand, thinks a poisonous wine made from a plant may have killed Alexander the Great

It would have tasted 'very bitter' but it could have been sweetened - and Alexander was likely to have been very drunk at the banquet.

But whether Alexander was poisoned is still a mystery.

We'll never know really,' Dr Schep concluded.
