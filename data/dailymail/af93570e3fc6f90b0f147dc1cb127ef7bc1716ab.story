Chris Christie wasn’t willing to leave his job as New Jersey governor to be Mitt Romney’s running mate because he believed the former Massachusetts governor would lose, sources said.

Several sources exclusively told the New York Post that the fiery New Jersey governor doubted a win, and thought serving as Romney’s vice presidential nominee wasn’t worth the risk. 

The main reason for Christie’s doubt, one source said, stemmed from Romney’s choice to only release limited tax returns, as well as his disastrous international tour earlier this summer.

One source told the Post: ‘There were people around him that wanted him to reconsider, to actually push to be vice president. But he’s known there are real issues here. Chris knows the score.’

Sources also said that the outspoken governor also worried about a Romney-Christie ticket because of two Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

Because of the way the laws have been written, large banks and investment advisers would not be allowed to 

Thus, Christie, who will turn 50 next month, would have had to step down from his government position to ensure top campaign donations.

Another source from the Romney campaign added: ‘Christie refused to resign under any circumstances. It had nothing to do with Chris’ personality and everything to do with money.’

The governor has not yet commented on the Post's front-page story.

However, Politico’s Maggie Haberman finds several issues with what the sources were saying.

She writes today: ‘No one has ever suggested Christie was actually offered the VP post, although he was in contention, and it seems unlikely he would have asked not to be considered.’

She said the bigger implication in the Post’s exclusive was that he thought Romney would lose the election.

Christie will deliver the keynote address at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, which has now been squeezed into three days because of Tropical Storm Isaac.

He has already been actively posting pictures ahead of the event on his Tumblr page.

Republicans already in Florida for the convention are already buzzing about the possibility of a Christie 2016 ticket.

Assemblyman John Amodeo told New Jersey’s Star Ledger: ‘I don’t want to be negative, and I really hope that Romney wins, but God forbid, if he loses, I would love to support the governor.’

Risky business: If he ran with Romney, Christie would have had to resigned from his governor post because of laws that don't allow for large donations to presidential campaigns for current governors

When the reporter first asked about the possible ticket, Delegate Amodeo pumped his fists in the air out of excitement.

The governor, who is known for his tough public image and short temper with off-topic reporters, took his office in 2010.

He told Oprah this past January that despite his list of political achievements, he still struggles daily with this weight, adding that he was working with a personal trainer several times a week and starting a diet to help trim down his waistline.

However, it seems that the governor’s frame has shrunk very little – if at all – since the interview last winter, an issue that Russell Riley of the University of Virginia’s Presidential Oral History Program said may be a hindrance for a presidential run.

Riley told Bloomberg Businessweek: ‘We live in a media age in which there are these conventional expectations of what a successful individual looks like. The closer you comport with those kind of cultural ideas about how someone on television looks, the better you do.’

Christie’s weight and prominent position has made him the punch line of many late-night talk show hosts, most notably Jimmy Kimmel.

While hosting this year’s the White House Correspondent’s Dinner, the ABC late night host quipped: ‘It’s not the Olive Garden state.’

Following the dinner, Christie returned with a retort of his own, saying that at least he got to dine next to Modern Family’s Sofia Vergara.
