An 86-year-old New York City man who called 911 and said he shot his daughter was fatally shot by responding officers on Saturday. The man turned toward the officers with a shotgun and refused to drop it when they arrived, police said.

Jack Calvello was shot once in the torso by a uniformed police officer following the 11:16 a.m. call to his Astoria, Queens home and was pronounced dead at a hospital, police said.

Calvello reportedly called 911 and said 'I shot my daughter and my dog' before saying he planned to shoot himself, the New York Daily News reports.

Calvello's 65-year-old daughter, Carolann Matyka, was found with a gunshot wound to the head in the kitchen of the red-brick home and rushed to a hospital where she was pronounced dead at 3:45 p.m., police said.

Crime: Police are seen in the area outside of Calvello's home. Calvello reportedly called 911 saying he shot his daughter and her dog

A loaded 12-gauge shotgun was recovered from the scene, according to investigators.

It wasn't immediately clear what sparked the incident.

Two teenage boys playing basketball near the home, Bryan Garcia and Eric Soto, told the Daily News they saw Calvello come out of the house's doorway pointing the shotgun at the two officers and then heard police tell him to drop the weapon before the shot was fired.

'When they shot him, it made us shake,' Soto, 15, said. 'At that point we covered our heads and ran; we were terrified.'

'That was the first time weâ€™ve seen someone die, so it was terrifying,' Garcia said.

Weapon: Jack Calvello, 86, reportedly faced responding officers with this 12-gauge shotgun

Matyka's brown Yorkshire terrier named Jack suffered a neck injury, but was expected to survive, according to the paper. Police said it was believed to have been shot as well.

Realtor Dean Rocco, 29, told the Daily News that Calvello was a Vietnam veteran and bought his house in 1968. Calvello reportedly lived in the basement and his daughter upstairs, while a couple rented another floor in the home. Rocco said he did not witness trouble between Calvello and his daughter.

'I would see them every day. I never saw any kind of altercation between them,' Rocco said.

The two responding policemen, a sergeant and a police officer, were unhurt.
