William Hague last night warned that the horrific chemical weapons attack in Syria was ‘not something that a humane and civilised world can ignore’.

The Foreign Secretary refused to rule out any response to Wednesday’s atrocity in Damascus.

And he laid the blame for the attack – which is reported to have killed up to 1,700 people – squarely at the door of tyrant Bashar al-Assad.

Mr Hague said the possibility that rebel fighters could have unleashed the chemicals, as claimed by the Assad regime and its Russian allies, was ‘vanishingly small’.

He said: ‘I know some people in the world would like to say this is some kind of conspiracy brought about by the opposition in Syria – I think the chances of that are vanishingly small. So we do believe this is a chemical attack by the Assad regime on a large scale.’

Mr Hague, who discussed the crisis with US Secretary of State John Kerry and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, called for UN chemical weapons inspectors to be allowed immediate access to the site of the attack before any evidence deteriorates.

Mr Ban added that inspectors, who are based a 20-minute drive away, should be allowed in ‘without delay’.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond 
suggested the atrocity could harden Britain’s response to the civil war 
in Syria, saying: ‘If, as the evidence suggests, chemical weapons have 
been used on a significant scale against a civilian population, those 
who are responsible should be in no doubt they will be held to account 
by the international community.’

It comes as American media report that the U.S. military is preparing for a long-range missile attack on Syrian government targets.

Escalation towards a military strike could mean that President Barack Obama intends to make good on his threat of 'enormous consequences' if Assad crossed the 'red line' of using chemical weapons against his own people.

Possible targets include command bunkers and missile sites that could be used to launch chemical-tipped missiles.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey is expect to present the plan for a missile strike to Obama at a national security meeting on Saturday.

CBS News reports that 'The Pentagon is making initial preparations for a missile attack on Syrian government forces.'

Commanders of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean ordered warships to move closer to Israel, so they would be in better striking range to hit forces in Syria.

There are four main options facing Hague and his allies, none of which offer an easy way out

The maximum range for Tomahawk Cruise Missiles is about 1,500 miles.

However any missile strike is likely to be more tactical than strategic - they are unlikely to topple, or even significantly destabilize Assad's regime and so American leaders will be hoping that instead it sends a strong message to the regime that chemical weapons will not be tolerated.

David Cameron is expected to carry out a round of telephone diplomacy from his Cornish holiday retreat over the weekend and convene the National Security Council next week to discuss Britain’s options for a response.

In recent weeks the Prime Minister has backed away from the idea of arming Syria’s rebels because of concerns within his own party that the weapons could fall into the hands of extremists.

But a Downing Street source said Britain would ‘look again’ at its options in the wake of the latest outrage.

Yesterday the UN revealed the number of children fleeing the conflict had passed one million. The UN’s refugee agency and Unicef described the figure as a ‘shameful milestone’ and warned two million more children are displaced within Syria.
