Enner Valencia announced himself to the Premier League on Monday night when he scored a stunning goal for West Ham in their 2-2 draw with Hull at the KC Stadium.

Thierry Henry - Arsenal 1-1 Manchester United, Premier League - March 28, 2004 

Even though he was well known for his ability to generate power, Thierry Henry took everyone at Highbury by surprise when he smashed a long-range effort past Roy Carroll in a 1-1 draw with Manchester United in March 2004.

The Frenchman's strike was straight down the middle but United's goalkeeper had no chance given the swerve and pace on the shot.

Darren Ambrose - Manchester United 1-2 Crystal Palace, Carling Cup - November 30,  2011 

The hosts might have had youngster Ben Amos in between the sticks but no goalkeeper in the world would've saved Darren Ambrose's ferocious drive during Crystal Palace's Carling Cup quarter-final upset at Old Trafford.

The former Charlton midfielder has a tendency to pull off the spectacular but this will likely go down as the best goal of his career.
