A bride who was too ashamed to try on wedding dresses due to her size 20 frame has shed six-and-a-half stone down to a slim size ten.

Hayley Tweddle, 28, from Welton, Lincolnshire, refused to start attending fittings for her wedding dress before her 2012 nuptials because she was too embarrassed to strip down to her underwear.

And after squeezing into a plus-size white dress from the high street, she was mortified when she saw photographs of herself on her big day - and vowed to shed the pounds.

Now, the mother-of-one tips the scales at just over 10 and a half stone - and is looking forward to wearing a size 10 gown to renew her vows to husband Jonathan, 33.

Hayley, 28, said: 'It should have been the happiest day of my life - the day every girl dreams of but instead I felt embarrassed and vulnerable as I was on display.

'I couldn’t look anyone in the eye and I felt uncomfortable being the centre of attention.

'I had always been overweight and never felt the same as everyone else.

'I was trapped in a cycle of not exercising and eating junk food. I piled on the pounds and felt terrible and ashamed of my body.

When Hayley met husband Jonathan, 33, in 2008 she was a size 18,

However her diet - which included nightly takeaways and frequent meals out - meant Hayley soon found her weight increasing to 15-and-a-half stone and a size 20.

After the birth of her son James, now three, Hayley found it difficult to lose her pregnancy weight and continued to wear comfy elasticated maternity wear for two years after she had given birth.

Hayley said: 'I never lost my pregnancy weight - I just stayed the same size even after the birth.

People would ask me if I was expecting again, or if I had given birth yet. I was mortified.'

Hayley and Jonathan were married in September 2012.

Hayley said: 'I bought my wedding dress for £40 from the high street without trying it on as I didn’t feel worthy to step into a bridal shop.

'I was too ashamed to try on different dresses, let alone have them tailored to my body shape.

'I felt uncomfortable and didn’t want to pose for any photographs on the day.

'When we got the wedding pictures back in January 2013 I realised how big I have become, and how sad I was on the day.

'I knew it was time to do something drastic.'

Hayley spoke to a friend in who recommended Slimming World, and the very next day she joined up to her first class.

Hayley says she can't believe the  transformation in the year since her wedding day

'I felt so nervous going to the first meeting but within one week I had lost six pounds and could feel my clothes were looser.'

Hayley swapped the takeways for healthy salads and stir fries and continued to lose a steady two pounds a week.

Hayley now weighs a healthy 10 stone 10 pounds and one year on is a size ten.

She said: 'This has been the first year I can pop into the sales and pick up a size ten dress and know it will fit me.

'I can’t believe the transformation - I have so much more energy to play with my son and I am so happy.

'Jonathan is delighted - he loves me just the way I am but he is happy that I am not moaning about my weight anymore.

'When I talk to people I still can’t get my head around the fact that they don’t know the “old overweight” me.

'I am now becoming a Slimming World consultant myself as I can’t wait to help others feel as great as I do.'
