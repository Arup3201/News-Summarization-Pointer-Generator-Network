These breathtaking cloud formations all bear an incredible likeness to countries or animals - including the mythical song character Puff, The Magic Dragon.

With a perfectly clear blue sky for a backdrop, the long snout and an eye can be seen as well as a large belly, two legs and even a tail.

The cloud looks remarkably like the creature described in the 1963 popular song Puff, The Magic Dragon by music group Peter, Paul and Mary. 

Puff, The Magic Dragon: An unusual cloud forms the appearance of a dragon in the sky above Krakow, Poland

Taking shape: A large cloud appears to form the mainland of the United Kingdom - but with Northern Ireland missing

The lyrics were based on a 1959 poem by Leonard Lipton, a 19-year-old Cornell University student.

It tells the story of the ageless dragon Puff and his playmate Jackie Paper, a little boy who grows up and loses interest in the imaginary adventures of childhood and leaves Puff alone and depressed.

The story of the song takes place 'by the sea' in the fictional land of Honalee.

The unusual cloud was captured on camera by Henryk T Kaiser, from Krakow, Poland, above his home town.

He has managed to photograph several striking cloud formations - including one that looks like a face and another that forms the shape of a pyramid.

One of his pictures also looks like the shape of Great Britain - with just Northern Ireland missing.

The hump of East Anglia is visible as are the Scottish Highlands and Cornwall.

Photographer T Kaiser has won over 60 awards at some of the best known International Competitions and Exhibitions.
