Nathan Baxendale was shamed into turning himself in - less than 48 hours after pulling off the bank raid

A bank robber has been jailed after his poorly planned caper turned him into an online laughing stock and forced him to turn himself in.

Nathan Baxendale, 21, surrendered to police less than 48 hours after pulling off the bank job because his failure to wear a disguise while committing the crime made evading capture impossible.

Baxendale strode into a branch of the Co-op bank in Bury, Greater Manchester, last month and handed staff a note saying: 'Give me your money, I have a gun.'

Hailing a taxi to make his getaway with £2,000 in cash, Baxendale thought he had escaped cleanly.

However, by not concealing his identity, the hapless criminal made it easy for police to obtain clear pictures of him from the bank's high quality CCTV system.

Only hours later, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) had Baxendale's identity after Facebook users recognised him from the CCTV images, posted by the force on the social networking site.

Comments written below the photos were less than kind to Baxendale, branding him an 'idiot', a 'plonker', and a 'fool'.

Officers turned up at Baxendale's mother's house and, while he was not home, he handed himself in the very next day - less than 48 hours after the bank raid had taken place.

He later admitted to committing the crime to pay drug debts and buy clothes.

He appeared at Bolton Crown Court on Monday admitting to robbery and was sentenced to three years and four months behind bars.

Detective Sargent Ian Partington said: 'This was an extremely bizarre incident for which there was only ever going to be one outcome.

By failing to hide his identity, Baxendale made it very easy for police to trace him using CCTV footage

'Baxendale
 walked into the bank bold as brass, made no attempt to conceal his 
identity and made what the cashier believed was a credible and 
terrifying threat.

'Once
 we reviewed the CCTV and saw just how good the systems were and how 
clearly he had been captured we knew if would only be a matter of time 
before he was caught and obviously he has pleaded due to the 
overwhelming evidence against him.

'I would also like to thank the public for their assistance in identifying Baxendale and helping us to expedite our inquiries.

'Since
 the appeal was issued on social networking sites, we had an 
overwhelming response and as a result of comments and information left 
on GMP’s Facebook site, we made an arrest.

'Baxendale now has a long time in prison to reflect on his actions, which were, quite frankly, stupid in the extreme.'
