A suspected British drug dealer, wanted by French police on suspicion of masterminding a gang that smuggled hundreds of kilos of cocaine and heroin through France into England, has been arrested in Thailand.

Michael France, 53, was arrested in the seaside resort town of Cha-Am, where he had purchased a luxury flat after moving to Thailand in 2008, local police said.

He was arrested following a tip-off from French law enforcement officials through the country's embassy in Thailand.

French police said the suspect
 fled France in 2008 after customs officers arrested a group of 
Englishmen carrying almost 30kg of cocaine and 95.11 kilograms of heroin in their car.

Following an investigation, French authorities said gang 
members were paid between £3,700 and £10,000 per shipment.

They believe the gang had 
been active for 18 months and smuggled a total of 375 kilograms of drugs.

French officials told their Thai counterparts that the suspect had been behind the scheme and had hired the men to transport the drugs.

France said at a police news conference held at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok that he had been unaware of the allegations against him.

Immigration police chief Lt. Gen. Panu Kerdlarppol said France would be interrogated and his case was forwarded to Thai prosecutors for further action.
