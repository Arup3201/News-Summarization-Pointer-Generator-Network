She's pregnant for the second time, but Kourtney Kardashian has no plans to make baby daddy Scott Disick her husband.

The reality TV star, 33, who has a two-year-old son Mason and a daughter on the way, is hesitant to walk down the aisle because of her 'commitment issues.'

No wedding bells: Kourtney was quizzed about her relationship while on Jimmy Kimmel Live last night with sisters Khloe and Kim

Disick, 29, has previously expressed his desire to marry her.

Kourtney was asked why she didn't want to wed during her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live last night with sisters Kim, 31, and Khloe, 27.

'Do you wanna be in my therapy session?' Kourtney responded with a laugh.

'First of all, I have realised that I have major commitment problems during this pregnancy.

'I'm really claustrophobic, and all my issues - and I have a lot of them - they all stem from this thing. I can't commit to anything... but I love Scott, and he is my partner.'

She added:
'We are committed to each other, we are together, we have a great 
partnership - I don't think I'm any different than Khloe and Lamar 
[Odom, 32].'

Kimmel then made a biting reference to her sister's failed 72-day marriage to basketball player Kris Humphries. 'Why don't you try it for a little while like Kim did?'

The sisters managed a smile but didn't comment on the quip.

Kourtney and Scott have endured plenty of ups and downs, many of which have been documented on the Kardashian's reality show over the years.

During the early stages of their relationship she suspected he was unfaithful to her and they split up for a time.

He also had a violent episode while in Miami after the birth of their son as well as several other alcohol-related outburst.

He sought therapy and Kourtney's family have been impressed by his transformation. 

Bruce - who is married to Kourtney's 
mother Kris Jenner - told Australian radio station 2Day FM recently: 'I have to
give him credit. He really has turned his life around.

'He doesn't drink anymore; he's been a
great dad with Mason, he's there all the time. He's really been doing a
great job. I commend anyone who can do that.'

The Kardashian are currently promoting their new business venture - a make-up range called Khroma Beauty.
