It's a problem that has spoiled exam papers, texts - even articles.

And now, the elusive apostrophe has struck once more.

In a blunder that has sparked furious debate across Cambridge, one street features all three variations of the punctuation mark.

Outrage: Residents in Cambridge warn the misuse of punctuation on signs could confuse emergency services

The signs for Worts’ Causeway in Cambridge - named after 17th century landowner Sir William Worts - read Worts, Worts’ and Wort’s.

Cambridge City Council is already facing criticism for abolishing all grammar from signage and some locals have started adding their own apostrophes.

Now, locals are calling for official guidance on the matter.

Marketing expert Jeremy Jones, 33, who lives on the street with three names, said: 'We shouldn’t be removing punctuation from road signs.

'The whole point is that it’s named after an individual and it’s part of the character of the area.

'If you remove it, it takes out that heritage. But if the council is going to have a policy, it should apply it correctly.'

Cllr John Hipkin, an independent member on Cambridge City Council and a former English teacher, agreed.

He said: 'We don’t want any warts on Sir William Worts’ name. He should be properly remembered.'

The three signs displaying the name of a street named after landowner Sir William Worts feature three different uses of the apostrophe

Policy: The council attempted to rule out punctuation from all signs, but these signs have slipped through

Kathy Salaman, director of the Cambridge-based Good Grammar Company, said the apostrophe should come after the ‘s’ - making Worts’ the correct spelling.

She said: 'My understanding is that it is named after somebody and so the apostrophe has to come after the 's'.

'You could add an additional ‘s’ after that but it is a matter of preference really.

'The other two variations of the street name are certainly wrong.'

The move to ban apostrophes from all signage in the city came in the light of new national guidance which warned punctuation could confuse emergency services.

Council bosses were widely criticised for dropping apostrophes with local government secretary Eric Pickles wading in to blame the ban on 'overzealous pen-pushers'.

But despite the confusion a council spokeswoman has claimed there are no plans to remove the incorrect signs.

She said: 'Whilst we agree the correct form of usage is Worts’ Causeway, our records show the name has been represented in various forms over the years.

'Having looked at documents produced by others we can also see the same variations appearing over time as well.

'Whilst there may be an inconsistency, we don’t believe this is causing confusion locally.

'We are not proposing to replace the signs at this time as this would not be a good use of council taxpayers’ money.'
