A U.S. population census has named North Dakota as the top American state to live in for a secure and happy marriage.

The northern U.S. area ranked among the top states for marriage while also posting lower than average divorce rates, according to the first-of-its kind analysis by the Census Bureau.

With marriages at an all-time low, states in the South and West of America ranked among the highest for couples hearing wedding bells.

The analysis noted, however, that many of these states also have higher rates of divorce.

The Census Bureau analysis also found that people are waiting longer before marrying for the first time.Â 

Wedding bells: States in South and West America in general had the highest amount of marriages

In particular, the percentage of women who wed as teenagers has dropped since 1970, while many men are postponing marriage past their college-age years.

Regionally, the South and West had the most marriages, with rates of roughly 19 per 1,000. But they also led in divorces, each at about 10 per 1,000.

Maine, Alaska, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Nevada, ranked at the top for divorces, while Utah, Wyoming and Arkansas - which had the highest marriage rates - were also higher than average in marital breakups.

New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York ranked among the lowest in divorces.

North Dakota ranked among the top states in marriages while posting lower than average divorce rates.

The Census Bureau report attributed the lower rates of divorce in the Northeast in part to delayed marriage in those places, which decreased the likelihood of marital discord down the road.

Andrew Cherlin, a professor of sociology and public policy at Johns Hopkins University, said: 'Surprisingly, the South and West, which we think of as more socially conservative, have higher rates of divorce than does the supposedly liberal East.

The geographical centre of North America is in Rugby, North Dakota.

The state was recently voted the friendliest in the U.S. and has also been ranked the safest state to live in.

In
2006 North Dakota broke the record for the biggest ever french fries 
feed, dishing out 4,620 pounds of the salty snacks at its annual French 
Fries Frenzy.

North Dakota has more wildlife refuges than any other state.

It
also has the world's biggest all-sports store, the 196,000 square-ft 
Scheels Flagship Store in the state's largest city Fargo (above) which 
has its own ferris wheel.

'The reason is that young adults in 
the South and West tend to have less education and marry earlier, both 
of which lead to a higher risk of divorce.'

'The South and West also have many 
migrants from other parts of the region who have left their social 
support networks behind. When they have marital problems, they have 
fewer people to turn to for help,' he added.

As
to the age at first marriage, the Census Bureau found that men and 
women were now joining in wedlock later and across a greater range of 
ages.

For
instance, in 1970, more than half of men, 57 per cent, were between the
ages of 20 and 24 when they first married.

By 2009, the age 
distribution was much wider, with 24 per cent marrying between the ages 
of 20 and 24, 34 percent marrying between the ages of 25 and 29, 20 
percent marrying between the ages of 30 and 34, and 9 percent marrying 
between the ages of 35 and 3.

Similarly for women, in 1970, 42 percent
of women were teens when they married, and by the age of 24 about 88 
percent of women had a first marriage. By 2009, the shares had dropped 
to 7 percent and 38 percent, respectively.

As a whole, since 1970, the median age at first marriage increased from 22.5 years to 28.4 for men and from 20.6 years to 26.5 for women.

Pamela Smock, a sociology professor at the University of Michigan, said the rising median age of first marriage is a reflection in part of the proliferation of new types of family groups, including couples who choose to live together and/or have children outside of marriage.

Recently divorced women who lived with their children were found to experience the most financial hardship compared with others.

In 2009, roughly 1.1 million 
children, or 1.5 per cent of all children, lived in the home of a parent
who divorced in the previous year.

Delaware and Wyoming ranked at the 
top for states with more widowers (5.4 per 1,000 men), while Hawaii had 
the most widows (10.3 per 1,000 women).

The census analysis is based on 2009 data from the American Community Survey, which sampled 3 million households.

It is the first to describe detailed 
information on marriages and divorces from this survey after the 
National Center for Health Statistics stopped collecting such data in 
1996.

'People are no longer following some lockstep script about when it is time to get married,' she said.

As a whole, marriages are now at a 
record low, with just 52 percent of adults 18 and over saying they were 
joined in wedlock, compared with 57 percent in 2000, according to census
data released last September.

The never-married included 46.3 per 
cent of young adults 25-34 - the first time the share of never-married 
young adults exceeded those who were married, 44.9 percent, with the 
rest being divorced or widowed.

Marriages
have been declining for years due to rising divorce, more unmarried 
couples living together and increased job prospects for women.

But
analysts say younger people also may now be increasingly choosing to 
delay marriage as they struggle to find work and resist making long-term
commitments in the recent recession.
