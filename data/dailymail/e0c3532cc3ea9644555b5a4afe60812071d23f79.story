‘Hi-ho, hi-ho, it’s off to work we go…Arrrrghhhh!’ That’s definitely not in the script of Disney classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs but it’s something that visitors to Disney World in Orlando are going to be hearing a lot of.

For, after a lengthy hiatus, Magic Kingdom finally has a new roller coaster, the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, and MailOnline was one of the first to try it out.

A runaway train ride, the steep drops and sharp bends are as terrifying as the Wicked Queen but considerably more fun, while inside, the walls are studded with more than a million ‘diamonds’ as well as a tableaux featuring Sleepy, Doc, Grumpy, Bashful, Sneezy, Happy and Dopey.

Totally terrifying: Disney's Seven Dwarves Mine Train was so much fun, Travelmail had four goes

While the Mine Train is the big new attraction, Disney has been busy behind the scenes at its Florida resort and as a result, there’s plenty to be found in Florida that you won’t unearth in LA or Paris, including an extended Hollywood Studios theme park.

Home to the Tower of Terror and the Aerosmith Rock n’ Roller Coaster, it might, on the face of it, be for children but that doesn’t mean the grown-ups can’t get involved.

100ft drops (the Tower of Terror), being shot forward at 90mph to the sound of Dude Looks Like A Lady (Rock n’ Rollercoaster) or shooting chipmunks in a mobile shooting gallery (Toy Story), there’s plenty to enjoy. Indeed, I loved the Rock n’Roller Coaster so much, I went on twice.

But the resort isn’t all terrifying twists and hairpin bends. For those in search of something gentler, Magic Kingdom’s stable of child-friendly rides - the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train notwithstanding - makes it perfect for tiny tots.

Hairpin bends: A ride on the Mine Train includes plenty of sharp bends and a seriously steep drop

Magical: Inside, the 'mine' has been kitted out with 'diamonds' and enthralling animated dwarves

Still around: The parade might have changed a little but classic characters such as Mickey and Donald remain

Enchanting: Fantasy Land, which includes the Cinderella Castle, boasts several new rides

Along with the pretty Main Street and the iconic Cinderella Castle, the newly revamped Fantasy Land is a small girl’s dream come true.

Once you’ve finished getting your kicks on the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train (I managed a record four goes on this one), there’s a series of gentle new rides to enjoy, among them Under the Sea: The Journey of the Little Mermaid, which conveys you through Ariel’s watery kingdom in pink plastic clamshells with a glimpse of Ursula the only scary part.

Then there’s the Winnie the Pooh ride which, if nothing else, should get younger readers clamouring for a copy of the AA Milne classic, and a traditional carousel complete with beautifully decorated prancing horses. 

Away from Fantasy Land, the Pirates of the Caribbean experience has also had a revamp (more Johnny Depp, much more!), while back on Main Street, Disney has launched a new parade to coincide with the unveiling of the new look Fantasy Land.

Called the Festival of Fantasy Parade, it includes all of the old favourites – Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and Donald among them – as well as some eye-openingly clever new additions.

I loved the 53ft long fire-breathing steampunk dragon that glared balefully at the children in the crowd as it sailed past, as well as Princess Merida of Brave fame’s vast set of mobile bagpipes. 

But while the new parade, Fantasy Land and the Seven Dwarves Mine Train have been gobbling up most of the headlines, I found myself enjoying some of the quieter spots such as the beautiful Boardwalk area and Animal Kingdom far more.

The latter is the largest and least well-known of the four theme parks that make up Disney World, which, incidentally, covers an area larger than Greater Manchester.

Here you’ll find the Kilimanjaro Safari, an experience that’s billed as seeing the animals as they really live but in reality is just as Disneyfied as everything else, and a petting area where you can get your hands on everything from ponies to chickens.

Top attraction: Animal Kingdom's Expedition Everest rollercoaster is one of the best in the entire resort

Disneyfied: The Mount Kilimanjaro 'safari' experience is fun but can't hold a candle to the real deal

Much more exciting are the Kali River Rapids, a souped-up log flume that sends you spinning beneath waterfalls and zig-zagging through a series of rapids, and my favourite, Expedition Everest.

With several seriously steep drops and a gorgeous view of the park from the top, as well as a stomach-churning section where you shoot backwards, Expedition Everest is as good as anything offered by Magic Kingdom. Indeed, so brilliant is Expedition Everest, I managed a record five goes.

Fun though Expedition Everest is, it’s the Mine Train that’s likely to end up with the longest queues – much to the irritation of those who can’t bear waiting in line.

Lucky then, that Disney has also launched a convenient new gadget called MyMagic Plus, a new wristband system that lets you book fast passes in advance and go shopping without having to carry a credit card around.

Usefully for those of a more forgetful bent, it also contains your park tickets. I used mine for multiple goes on just about everything and spent approximately five minutes queuing at the Haunted Hotel – the attraction that, for some reason, had the biggest lines on the day I went.

With no lines to worry about, it left me with much more time for whizzing about on the Mine Train and Big Thunder Mountain - an old favourite that I couldn’t resist revisiting for a second (and third) goes.
