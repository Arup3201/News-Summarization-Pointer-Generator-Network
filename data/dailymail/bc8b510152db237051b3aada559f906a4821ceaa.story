Zenit St Petersburg have made a £12million move for Manchester City midfielder Javi Garcia.

The 27-year-old has interest from Napoli also but the Italians are not prepared to match the Russians offer.

Garcia is poised to open talks with Andre Villas-Boas over a lucrative contract and City are happy to sell to balance their foreign quota. 

Manager Manuel Pellegrini is looking to trim his squad to meet the requirement that he selects from only 21 senior players in the Champions League.  

On his way? Manchester City midfielder Javi Garcia is wanted by Zenit and Napoli

City must have at least five English or English-trained players in their European squad. 

Pellegrini has insisted he will make only one more signing this summer after bringing in Fernando, goalkeeper Willy Caballero from his previous club Malaga and Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna.

A £32m deal for Porto's France international centre half Eliaquim Mangala is likely to be completed soon.

Meanwhile, Nottingham Forest manager Stuart Pearce reckons he saved Manchester City from going bust. 

Sacrificed: City are ready to let Garcia move on to balnce their foreign quota

Pearce says City were on the brink of bankruptcy during his time as their manager, and only the £21m sale of Shaun Wright-Phillips to Chelsea in 2005 saved them from going under.

'The club had sold the club shop, sold the ground to council, we were paying on the never and never for the Anelkas of this world,' he said.

'It really was a case that the owners said, 'Unless Wright-Phillips goes, we go.' On the Monday morning they pressed the button and Chelsea put £21million in the bank which bails the club out [but] which puts pressure on me because you are selling your goal-scorer.

'The club has gone from strength to strength and now they are a world power and spending £150m on a training complex. Times change.'
