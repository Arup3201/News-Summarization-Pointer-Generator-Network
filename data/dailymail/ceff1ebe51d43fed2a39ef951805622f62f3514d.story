A dummy worth a staggering five figure sum has been unveiled ahead of a baby show.

Jeweller Matt Case has crafted the 'world's most expensive' must-have for tots out of pure platinum.

The extravagant soother was placed on show at Russell and Case Jewellers at the aptly named Bling Bling building on Hanover Street in Liverpool.

The luxury dummy is worth £54,000 and is due to go on display at the UK Baby and Toddler Show

It weighs 250g and is estimated to be worth £54,000 - more than five times as much as previous record holder, a $17,000 white gold and diamond pacifier in the US.

Mr Case said: 'We wanted to make something that would stand out and something that was completely unique.

'That's why we decided to take an everyday object and put our own spin on it so the platinum dummy was born.'

Valued at £54,000 it is worth five times the next most expensive dummy, which is more than £10,000

The dummy is being displayed at Russell and Case Jewellers. It is made of pure platinum and weighs 250g

The expensive accessory will be on show at the UK Baby and Toddler Show on 2nd and 3rd February at the BT Convention Centre in Liverpool.

Laura Davies, Marketing and Events Manager for the event, said: 'The dummy is absolutely fantastic.

'The people at Russell and Case came up with an idea to do something huge and they created something truly remarkable.'
