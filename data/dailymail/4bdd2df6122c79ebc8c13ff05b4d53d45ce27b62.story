Steven Gerrard could be in line for a move to the MLS with Toronto FC, according to reports from Canada.

The Liverpool icon has yet to be offered a new deal at Anfield, with his contract up in the summer.

And with Jermain Defoe set to cut short his time in Canada, Toronto are on the lookout for a new 'marquee' player, believes NBC's Pro Soccer Talk.

Defoe is expected to return to the Premier League with QPR in the January window, as manager Harry Redknapp indicated on Thursday, provided terms can be agreed. 

The forward only moved to the Canada at the start of 2014, and he was Toronto's top scorer during the 2014 MLS season with 12 goals in 17 games.

And reports in Canada suggest Gerrard along with Galatasaray's Dutch veteran Wesley Sneijder top the MLS club's list of potential new recruits.

34-year-old Gerrard was left out of the starting line-up for their 1-0 defeat at Real Madrid in the Champions League in midweek along with the likes of Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling. 

But the club captain is set to return to the heart of midfield for their lunchtime clash with Chelsea on Saturday.
