An Australian snorkeller was found dead by locals following reports of his disappearance on Saturday night.

The man, 36, was holidaying with a friend at the exclusive Outrigger on the Lagoon resort in Fiji's Viti Levu island.

Police began searching the shoreline after they were alerted that he never returned from his lone snorkelling venture.

An Australian man, 36, was found dead by locals early Sunday morning after he went snorkelling by himself off Fiji's coral coast on Saturday afternoon. He was staying at the exclusive Outrigger on the Lagoon resort with a friend

The resort's general manager, Peter Hopgood, said the man had checked in with a friend for just one night.

He said the guest had gone snorkelling by himself about 3.20pm on Saturday and later returned to the beach.

He was last seen walking along the sand at 5.45pm but was snorkelling late in the evening, according to Mr Hopgood.

The man was reported missing when he hadn't returned his snorkelling gear and his belongings were found on the beach.

Police were alerted at about 7.45pm and searched for the man late into the night.

It resumed early Sunday morning and a neighbouring village of Fijians found the man's body washed up on a coral reef, about one kilometre south from the resort, on Sunday at about 9.50am.

The body has been taken to a morgue at nearby Sigatoka for an autopsy.

Mr Hopgood released a letter to the other guests at the luxury five-star holiday refuge, which said the resort was working closely with local authorities while the Australian High Commission was in the process of contacting the dead man's family.

'The resort has made the necessary arrangements with local authorities and the Australian embassy to return the body to Australia,' it said.

'The resort's family passes on our deepest condolences to the friends and family of the deceased.

'We request that guests refrain from entering the ocean after dark.'

Australian authorities had little to add.

'The department is providing consular assistance to the family of a 36 year old Australian man who died in Fiji,' a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said.

It's believed the man was originally from Perth but was residing in Melbourne.

The Outrigger, popular among Australians, is about 80 kilometres from Nadi.

The tragedy follows of the death of a Sydney father-of-three, Mark Hardaker, after a collision between two boats while holidaying with his family in Fiji on May 15.
