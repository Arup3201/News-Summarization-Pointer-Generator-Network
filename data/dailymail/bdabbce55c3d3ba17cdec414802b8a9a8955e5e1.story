Lenore Zimmerman, 85, was strip-searched in JFK airport when she asked to skip the metal detector for fear of disturbing her defibrillator

The TSA has finally apologised to two grandmothers who were strip-searched at JFK airport.

Wheelchair-bound Ruth Sherman, 89, was asked to pull down her trousers to show her colostomy bag as she prepared to fly out of the New York airport over the Thanksgiving holidays.

This incident came a week after Lenore Zimmerman, 85, says she was strip-searched after telling agents she didn't want to go through a metal detector because she has a defibrillator.

In a letter obtained by the New York 
Daily News, the Department of Homeland Security acknowledged that it is 
not standard procedure to make fliers to show their colostomy bags - as 
they forced Ms Sherman to do.

Assistant Homeland Security Secretary 
Betsy Markey wrote: ‘It is not standard operating procedure for 
colostomy devices to be visually inspected and (the TSA) apologises for 
this employee’s action.'

Violated: Florida 88-year-old Ruth Sherman said she was humiliated at JFK airport to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with family when TSA agents saw the bulge of her colostomy bag and decided to take a closer look

The TSA admits that while they did conduct an unauthorised scan of her back brace, they did not carry out a strip search.

Both Ms Sherman and Ms Zimmerman stick to their stories and said they were forced to strip in humiliating circumstances.

The two incidents happened within a week of each other in early December, as the women were flying out of John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, whose Terminal 3 was voted the worst in the world. 

The letter confirms that Ms Sherman, who is bound to a wheelchair, was asked to go to a private room and show TSA agents her colostomy bag.

'They asked me to pull my sweatpants down, and now they're not telling you the truth.'

The letter also states that she pulled down her pants by her own free will.

She still alleges that she was forced
to strip. ‘They asked me to pull my sweatpants down, and now they’re 
not telling you the truth,’ the grandmother told the Daily News on 
Monday.

Sen. Michael Gianaris, who initially 
wrote to the TSA to request an inquiry, is on the grandmothers’ side, 
and says their accounts of the searches are still questionable.

He
said that while the TSA did the right thing in admitting its agents 
didn’t adhere to protocol, ‘they’re still falling short of admitting 
that these women’s dignity was violated by asking them to remove their 
clothes.’

Ms Sherman initially made a complaint to
JetBlue, the airline she was flying, but was inspired to come forward 
when she saw the story of Ms Zimmerman, who requested to avoid the metal
detector because of her defibrillator.

The TSA also denied that they 
conducted a strip search on Ms Zimmerman, though they apologised for 
scanning her back brace, which is against policy.

She
told the Daily News that she’s not convinced of their report. ‘They’re 
lying,’ she said. ‘I don’t have a problem with (screeners checking) the 
back brace. I have a problem with being strip-searched.’

Ms Zimmerman, who is from Long Island, still insists that she was strip searched by TSA agents after she alerted them of her defibrillator.

Initially, the agency maintained that the search to Ms Zimmerman never happened.

The TSA has been criticised in recent months after it introduced full-body scanners, which initially raised privacy and time concerns.
