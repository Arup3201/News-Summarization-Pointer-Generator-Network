Manchester United have moved a step closer to landing Angel Di Maria as Carlo Ancelotti has revealed the Argentina attacker has said goodbye to Real Madrid.

Louis van Gaal has identified Di Maria as the man to add some pace to Manchester United's attack and it now looks as if the Dutchman has landed the World Cup star.

United, however, have been left stunned by the Spanish giants raising the asking price for Di Maria to £75million.

Manchester United had hoped to pay £56m for Di Maria, however Real Madrid upped their asking price as they knew Van Gaal was desperate to land a stellar signing this summer

Ancelotti, speaking at a press conference, said on the former Benfica winger: 'Di Maria has said goodbye. We thanked him for everything he has done for the club.

'We tried everything possible to keep Di Maria, but he has decided something else. Good luck to him.' 

Shirt number: Di Maria will wear United's No 7 shirt - a number which was previously worn by Cristiano Ronaldo

Di Maria, who will wear Manchester United's iconic No 7 shirt, is expected to earn in the region of £200,000-a-week at Old Trafford.

The Real Madrid boss also revealed Sami Khedira would be staying at the club despite speculation linking him with a move away from the Santiago Bernabeu.

'Khedira is happy here and he is staying,' added Ancelotti. 'The matter is resolved and he stays at Real Madrid.'
