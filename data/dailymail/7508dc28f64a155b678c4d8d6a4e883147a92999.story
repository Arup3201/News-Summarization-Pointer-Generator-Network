A Korean artist has created surrealistic fantasies based on traditional fairy tales, dreams and stories using incredible props in a tiny studio.

Jee Young Lee’s Stage of Mind, a project which she has been working on continuously since 2007, sees her construct scenes for her camera rather than employing the traditional method of taking photos of images such as still lifes, figures, or landscapes.

Her stage for these fictional scenes, which she says convey her psychological state, is her room-sized studio in Seoul, measuring just 360 x 410 x 240 centimetres.

Lee, 30, assumes the roles of set designer, sculptor, performer, installation artist, and photographer and she is the protagonist of each piece.

Mind blowing: Jee Young Lee, a Korean artist, 
has created Stage of Mind - a project which sees her construct scenes 
from fairy tales and her own personal experiences in a tiny studio

At times facing away from us, at other times showing only part of her body or reclining, she inhabits her dream-like realms.

Through bold materials and patterns, dramatic colours, and intriguing narratives Lee uses legends of East and West, Korean proverbs, personal childhood experiences, and her own life experience as inspiration for her work.

Among Lee’s new works, which are on display at the OPIOM gallery in France, is I’ll Be Back. This piece draws upon a Korean fable in which a tiger chases desperate children into a well. A god lowers a rope from the sky and the children escape, but when the tiger cries out, a rotten rope is lowered, condemning the tiger to a miserable fate.

Lee reinterprets the horror of this 
inescapable situation by suggesting the possibility of survival through 
her own will and her art shows her lone arm reaching for a rope just out
 of reach while thousands of traditional blue fans conjure up the 
threatening waters swirling around her.

Bright and bold: Through bold materials and patterns and dramatic colors, Lee uses legends of East and West as inspiration for her work

My chemical romance: This piece reflects relationships and communication through the motif of pipes that are complicatedly intertwined like a maze

Childhood: This piece recalls childhood memories and shows a girl who's fast growing up from her naive childhood but doesn't want to

Broken Heart is a nod to the Korean expression 'like breaking a stone with an egg' - an ineffectual effort made in a difficult situation.

Last Supper depicts the Christian image of Jesus’ last meal with the competition for limited resources illustrated by hundreds of rats racing toward a plate of cheese.

Resurrection, which suggests the hope of rebirth, is inspired by Shimchungchun, a Korean novel from the Chosun dynasty about a young woman who devotes herself to her blind father, and Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais’s Ophelia (1852), which depicts Shakespeare’s character having drowned herself after going mad from loss of Hamlet’s love and the death of her father.

Lee identified with the tragic heroine, rising among the water lilies.

The Last Supper: Inspired by da Vinci's the Last Supper, a plague of rats move toward a plate of cheese, which depicts the world where we have to compete for limited resources to survive

Protagonist: Lee is the star of her work, sometimes facing away from us, at other times showing only part of her body in her dream-like realms

I'll Be Back: This draws upon a Korean fable in which a tiger chases desperate children into a well. A god lowers a rope from the sky by which the children escape, but when the tiger cries out, a rotten rope is lowered, condemning the tiger to a miserable fate

Resurrection: Inspired by the Story of Shim Cheong, this is a Korea folktale that touches on the meaning of death and resurrection

Panic Room and Treasure Hunt are based on Lee's own childhood memories. Amidst Panic Room’s swirling patterns, objects fly off in all directions in an absurd dizziness, while Treasure Hunt’s grassy Eden, which Lee devoted three months to crafting, evokes a child-like wonderland.

Monsoon Season, which was inspired her her personal experience last summer when her studio was flooded, evokes the perils of navigating through thousands of seductive but poisonous sea anemones.

Lee’s constructed realities belong to the directorial mode, employed since the 1980’s by Postmodernist photographers in repudiation of the Modernist practice that sought truth in the everyday world.

Lee’s constructed image photography 
has been compared to the works of German sculptor and photographer 
Thomas Demand, who builds life-sized models he intends to demolish after
 photographing them.

Speaking about her work, she said: 'The primary motifs in this series derive from my questions about who I am at the moment.

'It
 is a photographic elucidation of my concerns about my identity, 
exploration about myself and search for the things that I am capable of 
doing, desire to do, enjoy doing and can do well, and furthermore, my 
thoughts on how I should live my life.

Nightscape: This work is a collaborative piece she produced with a traditional fan-making master. Each folding fan was carefully crafted, colored and arranged to complete the scene

The Little Match Girl: Based on Hans Christian Andersen's story of the same title, this work depicts the meaning of hope as portrayed by the girl striking a match to keep her alive in the cold

Nightmare: The figure uses a magnet and paper clips to express the problems that are 'forever entangled in life', says Lee

Added touch: She adds intricate plastic creativity and theatrical performance to her art

'I try to search for the answers to my questions and concerns through the process of photographing and the subsequent artwork. I am neither too young nor old enough, grown up but not fully formed like the fully grown but unripe fruit, and still under metamorphosis.

'I am an adult but cannot be categorised as an adult in entirety. I am an incomplete being who is not entirely independent. The main subject in my work is to reflect myself as a member of the society and as an individual who influences and is influenced by the surroundings in it.

'Therefore, through my work, I strive to complete myself by reflecting myself and to objectify my current status and situations by creating sceneries of them.

'My work, in essence, records my concerns and process of growing up. It narrates and dramatises my life stories.'

Recently graduated from Seoul’s Hongik University in her native South Korea, Lee is the recipient of multiple artistic awards including the Sovereign Art Prize 2012 and is dubbed one of Korea's rising stars.
