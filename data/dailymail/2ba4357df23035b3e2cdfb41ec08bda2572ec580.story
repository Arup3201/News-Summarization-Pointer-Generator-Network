Stefan Scepovic scored his first Celtic goal on Thursday and hopes it can be the start of things to come.

The Serbian found the net at the seventh time of asking as Celtic - in unconvincing fashion - beat Astra Giurgiu 2-1 in Europa League Group D.

Former striker Chris Sutton, working on television, said 'it cannot get much worse' for Celtic, but Scepovic was a happy man.

The Serbian slides on his knees after netting his first goal in Celtic colours at the seventh attempt 

'We won the game, it's very important,' he said on BT Sport 1. 'I had chances, we have got seven points from nine and that's the most important thing.

'I need to keep working in every training session, be ready for the team. We won 5-0 (against Ross County) in the Premiership, won 2-1 here and I'm ready. 'I always say I am working very hard.'

Stefan Johansen scored Celtic's second before Gabriel Enache made for a tense finish.
