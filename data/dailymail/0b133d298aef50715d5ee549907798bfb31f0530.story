Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said he learnt about economics at a young age, watching his family struggle to balance the books

Tory Cabinet minister Sajid Javid today revealed how his immigrant bus driving father taught him the value of money, as he launched an attack on Labour's tax and spending plans.

The Culture Secretary said he learnt about economics at a young age, watching his family struggle to balance the books and realising 'you can't spend money you don't have'.

He invoked Margaret Thatcher as he spoke of a 'greater moral purpose in politics' to leave the next generation better off.

The Conservative have stepped up their attack on Labour's economic record, warning Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have not learnt the lesson of the spiralling deficit they left in 2010.

But in a speech in London today, Mr Javid struck a personal note with his recollections of how money was tight growing up.

He was born in Rochdale, the middle child of five sons. His father Abdul, who came to Britain from Pakistan, worked around the clock as a bus driver, earning him the nickname 'Mr Night And Day'.

When Mr Javid was four, his father took over a ladieswear shop in inner-city Bristol, and the family moved into a two-bedroom flat above it.

Three brothers shared on room while Mr Javid and another younger brother were in a room with their parents.

'I learnt about economics at a young age,' he said in today's speech at the Centre for Policy Studies in Westminste,. 'My father came to this country with virtually nothing.

'But he worked hard on the buses to save enough money to start his own business. He began with a market stall and then he eventually opened a shop.'

He recalled how living above the shop he would 'help out whenever I could'.

'That background taught me some valuable lessons. It taught me that you need to plan ahead.

'It taught me that you've got to live within your means. It taught me you can't spend money you don't have.

'These are lessons this Government understands. Steadily, step by step, we are getting our country's economy back on track and we are getting the deficit down. We have a plan and it is working.'

He insisted the task to cut the deficit had to continue, to ensure the debts were not left for future generations.'

A former banker, Mr Javid was elected as an MP in 2010, and became Treasury minister two years later. In April this year he joined the Cabinet as Culture Secretary, after Maria Miller was forced to resign over her expenses. 

He said: 'It was Margaret Thatcher who said 'we in politics are in the business of planting trees for our children and grandchildren or we have no business being in politics at all'.

'I agree there is no greater moral purpose in politics than that – to leave our children something better than we ourselves have known. That is why we have to get the deficit down.'

Mr Javid accused Labour of planning to spend and borrow more if elected in 2015. The country, he said, faced a 'serious decision' at next year's general election about whether to continue with the current Government's 'long-term economic plan' it was putting into action or to 'hand Ed Miliband the keys to Downing Street and to go back to Labour's approach of higher taxes and more spending'.

He added: 'Do we continue to do the right thing, getting the economy back on track and getting the deficit down? Or do we return to spending more than we can afford and allow the deficit to continue for decades to come?'

The deficit he said was already down by more than a third, was predicted to fall to half by the time of the election in 2015 and then be eliminated before the end of the next parliament.

He said: 'When it comes to the deficit, Labour haven't learnt their lesson. No matter what they say in public, Labour are still planning to spend more and borrow more if they are elected.

'Spending and borrowing run through Labour like the words in a stick of rock.'

He claimed that Labour's future plans would mean in 21 years time the government would still be running a deficit of £24 billion in today's money.

'For every child in Britain today this is equivalent to an extra £35,000 of debt on each of their heads. More debt than they could ever hope to repay.

'Our plan to run absolute surpluses is the only reliable way to get the size of Britain's debt down to safe levels over a sensible time scale.'

But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the treasury, Chris Leslie, said: 'These numbers have been totally made up. Labour has not set out any plans for extra capital spending after the election, so this is just another example of the Tory lie machine in action.

'Sajid Javid should look at what is happening under his Government. Not only has David Cameron failed to deliver rising living standards he is also set to break his promise to balance the books by next year. In fact, this Government is set to borrow £190 billion more than planned in 2010 and borrowing is going up not down so far this year.'

He added: 'Labour has set out a tough fiscal commitment to balance the books - on the same measure used by George Osborne in this parliament - and get the national debt falling as soon as possible in the next parliament. 

'We will get the deficit down where this Government has failed, but we will do so in a fairer way - including by reversing David Cameron's tax cut for millionaires.'
