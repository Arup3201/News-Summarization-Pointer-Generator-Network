Bell-bottom flares and fringed waistcoats may make modern fashionistas wince but it was all the rage in the 1970s.

A cartoonish silhouette of fitted tailoring with oversized collars, cuffs and ruffles epitomised the glam disco look while patchwork, suede and peasant tops were the staples of bohemian hippies.

These garish combinations earned the seventies the reputation of the 'decade that fashion forgot', but many of these looks continue to influence designers today - SS15 is set to be all about the maxi dress.

Fashion in the '70s includes an introductory essay outlining the different fashion trends of the era and contextualises them against the socio-political movements of the time, from radical feminism to eco-consciousness.

Few conventions were left unchallenged in the an era of social movements, political mistrust, and not surprisingly, rich cultural diversity.

It was the 'Me' Decade, a reaction against 60s radicalism reflected in fashion, film, the arts, and music. It was the decade of disco: Who can forget the image of John Travolta and his magnificent steps on the dance floor in the movie Saturday Night Fever? 

A biographical section in the new book features all the major designers and fashion houses, and gives an in-depth insight into the main movers and shakers of Seventies fashion.
