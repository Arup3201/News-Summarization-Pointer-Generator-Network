Britons flocked to beaches across the southern coast yesterday as millions look set to bask in glorious sunshine today.

Temperatures soared to 17C in Brighton and Dorset, with people starting their long weekend in deck chairs by the sea.

Figures from Asda suggest the unexpected sunshine has also inspired a wave of impromptu barbecues, with sales of sausages and equipment expected to triple those in April.

Sun's out: Brighton beach was packed with Britons enjoying the unexpected sunshine to start the long weekend as temperatures hit 17C across the south coast

Although frost is set to hit the south tonight - with temperatures dropping to 1C - Britons stocking up for a barbecue will be in luck tomorrow, with forecasters predicting dry and sunny weather across southern England, southern Wales and the south Midlands.

In Weymouth, Dorset, the sun came out in time for the town's annual kite festival, held on the beach.

But the good weather has not been enjoyed by all as heavy rain poured down across the north west.

Unfortunately, the dark clouds and intermittent rain across northern England and Scotland is set to last throughout the long weekend and into Tuesday.

However, the north east enjoyed a bright spell at midday today with sun shining in Harrogate and York ahead of the rainy weekend.

Met Office spokesman Helen Roberts told MailOnline: 'It hasn't been great for the whole country - it's been a story of two halves.

Frost and temperatures of 1C are forecast to hit southern England tonight, but those planning a barbecue can bank on a dry, sunny day tomorrow

According to the Met Office, today's temperatures in Brighton were not unusual for this time of year, but it follows a windy and wet spell

'The best of the sunshine has been 
towards to south and south east, and further north there's been a lot of
 cloud and outbreaks of rain. Tomorrow will be a similar picture.

'These temperatures are about 
average for this time of the year. We might see 17C tomorrow but not 
much higher.

'The most unusual thing is overnight minimum temperatures, which are really going to be quite low. We're looking at a touch of air frost tonight in places in the south, where there will be clear skies. That's not common for May.'

Tonight, cloud and drizzle 
is expected to cast over northern and western areas of the country, with
 heavier bursts of rain in Scotland.

Three day forecast: Tomorrow sunny spells and warm weather is set to cover southern England, but the heavy rain up north is set to stay

Southern and eastern England looks set to remain dry,clear, and mild, despite cold temperatures in East Anglia.

The intermittent rain and cloud currently sweeping across the north is set to last throughout Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.

Cloud
 and rain will spread into northern and western parts of the country on 
Bank Holiday Monday, with heavy rain in the evening.

Apart from a few showers, southern and central parts of England should be largely dry with some warm sunshine breaking through.
