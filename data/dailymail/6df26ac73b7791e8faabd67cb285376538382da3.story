The moment an Australian mother-of-five is hurled through the air 'like a rag doll' in a horrific road rage attack at the intersection of a main highway has been caught on a mobile phone.

Maxine Mole was driving home from a funeral with her daughter, Ashleigh, when she stopped to tell off a young man who she said was hurling abuse at an elderly man in a white Volvo.

Ms Mole said she asked her daughter to roll down her window to tell the young man to grow up and 'let the poor guy alone'.

Jeff Woodrum - who working in a nearby office building - heard yelling and got up from his desk to see what was going on

This brief interruption meant the elderly man could get away but then the young man turned his attention to Ms Mole.

He jumped out of the car and hit her driver's side window.

Ms Mole decided to get out of the car to calm him down, despite her daughter's protests urging her to stay in the car.

But her alleged attack did not calm down, instead he escalated the incident.

Ms Mole sustained gravel rash, cuts, bruises and a fractured shin bone that now requires surgery

Her daughter, Ashleigh, was in the car at the time of the attack and said she saw blood everywhere

She landed face first on the bitumen and Mr Woodrum and other by-passers came to her aid

'He’s grabbed me, next minute I know I was flying through the air,' Ms Mole told A Current Affair.

Her daughter said: 'I could just see all this blood. I was really scared.'

Ms Mole landed face first on the bitumen and sustained gravel rash, cuts, bruises and fractured her shin bone, which now requires further surgery.

The incident was captured on video by Jeff Woodrum who working 50 metres away in an office building and had the foresight to captured the altercation on his mobile phone after he got up from his desk when he heard yelling.

Ms Mole's alleged attacker will now front court on driving and serious assault charges

Mr Woodrum and other by-passers came to Ms Mole's aid.

'She was motionless, [the man] abused her some more then…hopped into his car…when he drove through the intersection more abuse and driving off with his head out of the window abusing her,' he said.

'Absolutely no care in what state she was in.'

Ms Mole hailed her saviours as her 'heroes', saying they were the ones who saved her life.

'My six-year-old cried she thought I was going to die,' she said.

'I would be here at all if it weren’t for them.'

Ms Mole's alleged male attacker will now face court on driving and serious assault charges.
