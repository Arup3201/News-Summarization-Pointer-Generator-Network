SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. is mounting a public defense of its animal handling in a new advertising campaign following the release of a highly critical documentary, Blackfish - which left the park with declining revenue and attendance.

The company has faced backlash since the release of the 2013 documentary that examined what led killer whale Tilikum to drown trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010 at SeaWorld's Orlando park.

The print and YouTube campaign that began on Monday also comes only a day before former SeaWorld trainer John Hargove is set to release a book detailing his experiences at the park, which could bring more negative attention to the company.

However, SeaWorld senior corporate affairs officer Jill Kermes claims the timing of the campaign has nothing to do with Hargrove's book release, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

SeaWorld is mounting a public defense of its animal handling in a new advertising campaign following the release of a highly critical documentary, Blackfish - which left the park with declining revenue and attendance 

SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. has faced backlash since the release of the 2013 documentary that examined what led killer whale Tilikum to drown trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010 at SeaWorld's Orlando park

'I think there's been a lot of misinformation out in the public about who we are and what we do,' said Kermes. 

'It has been a one-sided conversation and this is an opportunity for us to give people the information they need so they can make up their own minds.'

The campaign focuses on the marine-life theme park's efforts of caring for animals in captivity and in the wild, while 'setting the record straight on false accusations by activists who oppose whales and other animals in zoological settings'.

'There's been a lot of misinformation and even lies spread about SeaWorld, and we recognize that it has caused some people to have questions about the welfare of killer whales in human care,' said David D'Alessandro, Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. in a memo on Monday. 

'This long-term campaign will address those questions head on. We want to provide the facts, so people can make up their own minds on this important issue.' 

Jim Atchison (above), who had served as CEO and president since 2009, stepped down in January amid accusations that the company's treatment of killer whales may have led to the deaths of trainers. Last week, the new President and CEO was named as Joel Manby, who will take over the role in April

The print advertisements are set to appear in publications including the New York Times, The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal.

They ads feature staff from SeaWorld such as veterinarians and researchers, who will explain how the company cares for its killer whales.

The print ads began running on Monday and TV commercials will air next month, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

The marketing campaign will also  highlight the company's latest initiatives including a commitment of $10million in matching funds to study endangered killer whales in the wild.

Last Monday, SeaWorld launched its  'Meet the Animals'  campaign which introduces individual animals as it gives a look into sea life.

The YouTube campaign also shows videos of behind-the-scenes caring for SeaWorld's marine mammals by the company's veterinarians. 

Critics of that campaign said SeaWorld failed to explain that like orca whales and dolphins, sea lions fare poorly in captivity, as documented in an editorial by The Dodo.  

An official for the animal rights group PETA called SeaWorld's campaign 'a last-ditch effort.' PETA has led organized campaigns against SeaWorld.

'The tide has turned for SeaWorld,' said Jared Goodman, PETA's director of animal law. 'It's a last-ditch effort to sway a public that has already made up its mind.' 

It was reported in February that SeaWorld had a wider loss in its fourth quarter of $25.4 million as attendance to its theme parks continued to fall - due in part to Blackfish.

Jim Atchison, who had served as CEO and president since 2009, stepped down in January amid accusations that the company's treatment of killer whales may have led to the deaths of trainers.

The company also announced plans to build larger environments for its killer whales. 

Last week, the new President and CEO was named as Joel Manby, who will take over the role in April.
