Stars of the MTV reality shows, 16 & Pregnant and Teen Mom, Catelynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra, shared their teen pregnancy on television and had a baby, Carly, they placed for adoption. 

But their personal life before their reality show fame was mired in violence, drugs and sexual abuse.

The Teen Mom couple announced their engagement in December after Tyler surprised his sweetheart with an diamond engagement ring. Days later, Catelynn gave birth to their second child, Nova Reign. Their first child, Carly, now five, was given up for adoption when they were 16.

Besides telling their story, the reformed couple offer wayward teenagers advice on growing up and 'breaking the cycle of dysfunction' in a new book, Conquering Chaos, published by Post Hill Press. 

Both Tyler, 24, and Catelynn, who turns 24 on March 12, grew up in different trailer parks in Port Huron, Michigan, but they both experienced the trailer park trash life of intoxicated parents deep into drug abuse, parental jail time and violence.

Catelynn Lowell and fiancée Tyler Baltierra have been open about her mother and his father's battle with addiction. But they've never revealed the hell they experienced as children as a result or the terrifying habits their parents passed onto them. In their new memoir, Conquering Chaos, the Teen Mom fan-favorites, both 23, talk about witnessing drug-related gun fights, abusing ecstasy and cocaine and more

Out of control. Catelynn and Tyler admit they didn't give birth control much thought. They were using the pull-out method, and that was it. 'I didn't wear condoms and Cate never went on birth control,' writes Tyler. The Teen Mom and her boyfriend decided to give their baby up for adoption

Oh so innocent: Catelynn's mother was a drunk often passed out on the floor, her father an alcoholic and crack addict who spent most of his time in jail. Tyler  became a daycare delinquent at age five and was drinking, smoking weed and cigarettes and taking drugs by age eight

Catelynn says her mother was 'a b****' and a drunk often passed out on the floor, her father an alcoholic and crack addict who spent most of his time in jail.

'It was chaos all the time. I didn't like it, and I didn't thrive on it, but I was familiar with it. It was normal to me,' Catelynn writes.

Tyler's father was a crack addict, a con artist, who spent most of his son's younger years in jail while his supportive mother cycled through boyfriends. So the little boy became a daycare delinquent at age five and was drinking, smoking week and cigarettes and taking drugs by age eight.

The young couple fell in love at age twelve and 'we both ended up on the same wild ride'. 

'Our decision to have sex — and the way we handled it — brought about a consequence that changed our lives forever.'

The as-yet-unmarried childhood sweethearts had their second child, Nova on January 1 this year that they are raising, and decided to write about life before the cameras were rolling when they were terrified teenagers mired in the most extreme dysfunctional families in a seedy environment.

Catelynn viewed herself as a social butterfly and opted for multiple boyfriends over passing grades in school although school helped her forget how miserable life was back at the trailer.

Tyler spotted her when they were both in junior high, walked up and just took her hand.

'We just walked on ahead, holding hands, and we've been together ever since', he writes.

'Her smile lights up the room and her eyes are beautiful piercing gray. Plus, she's got bigger t**s than any other girl in the seventh grade.

'Definitely my kind of chick. I think to myself, "I have to have her."

He wrote her funny notes, cracked jokes, clowned around.

He was more open than she was and he taught her to state her own opinions after years of smothering them and lying.

'So speaking my mind and sharing my feelings just wasn't at the top of my list of survival skills. It wasn't something that had gotten positive results in the past.

'For my whole life, I had a habit of telling people what I thought they wanted to hear, even if it wasn't the truth'.

But they didn't start sleeping together until ten months later.

Tyler was molested by an older girl, a friend of his older sister, when he was nine years old.

'One day I went over to her house with my sister and some other people, and for some reason or another, everyone else left but this older girl and me. For the next several hours, while we were alone together in her house, it was sex act after sex act after sex act. It went on all day. She had us doing everything she could think of, one thing after another. There'd be a break and then it would start up again. And when it was finally over, I didn't know what the hell had happened'.

That incident left him wanting sex from girls who were only ten years old and if they didn't put out, he called them prudes and broke up with them.

When Cate finally gave in to Tyler's sexual desires, it was gangbusters – 'banging in his mom's trailer'.

'Once we'd done it once, we were doing it all the time! After waiting so long we turned into crazy, horny teenagers. It was so bad,' she says.

'We would drink and party together and fool around constantly, all the time'.

'Unfortunately, we were not being safe at all', Tyler says.

'We were using the pull-out method, and that was it. I didn't wear condoms and Cate never went on birth control. 

'We just didn't feel like we had to. My parents hadn't given me a real talk about it yet, and Cate's parents hadn't given her a talk. We went through sex education and everything, but I sort of thought I was an expert already.

We are family: 'Nothing better than getting to spend the day with both of these amazing woman... my sister and my mother... family is EVERYTHING!,' Tyler posted on Instagram

'We thought pulling out is good enough, and like typical dumb kids, we couldn't actually comprehend what would happen if it wasn't.

'We just approached sex like we'd taken the pills and the air duster. It was fun and it was available, so we did it, because the risks didn't really scare us. We were doing adult things with a child's level of understanding'.

They were also consuming big quantities of drugs.

He was smoking cigarettes and weed and drinking booze at age eight as well as 'huffin' air duster that he had stolen from CVS that make his head turn into a balloon. It caused him to have a seizure and pee all over himself.

She smelled pot in her house at age ten and started getting high on the sleeping pill Unisom to trip out hallucinating, consuming five or six at a time.

She snorted Ritalin – or anything else that happened to be around.

'And there was Robotrippin', where we chugged a bunch of cough syrup to get high. We did Ecstasy when we had that. Basically, anything we could get our hands on to get high with, we'd do it.

'I was a little behind on the air duster. I watched my friends do it for about a month, but I was kind of scared of it. But then I got curious to see what the big deal was, so I started doing that, too.

'We never really drank much, funny enough. We did everything else we could get, huffin', snorting pills, smoking weed, we were all about that stuff. But even our friends weren't really drinking. Why drink when you can huff air duster?' – was her thought.

Happy reunion: Catelynn and Tyler's reunion with their biological daughter was filled with joy, smiles and plenty of happy tears

She was just trekking down the same drug route that generations of her relatives had traveled for years. He was in the same boat.

'It would have been better not to mess around with air duster and snort cocaine in middle school. No doubt about that', she says.

'And we can never be certain how long that phase would have lasted, if it wasn't for one little thing. Once that pregnancy test came back positive, there was no more room for drugs and alcohol in our lives.

'We dropped that stuff and didn't even have time to look back.'

The teen pregnancy saved their lives from falling further into drug abuse.

Now the couple are pursuing healthy, positive lives and hope to encourage teenagers in trouble with self-esteem issues or in unhealthy relationships to seek out counseling to learn self-worth.

'I put my life out there to help others', Catelynn writes.

'For the kids growing up in trailer parks, unstable homes or in the shadow of family problems and addiction –

'Single moms.

'Pregnant teens feeling lost and scared.

'Anyone trapped in a cycle of dysfunction and wants to make something better of their lives—whatever encouragement we can offer, we offer it from the bottom of our hearts'.
