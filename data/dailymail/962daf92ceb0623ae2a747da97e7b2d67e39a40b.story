Catch of the day: Dorset fisherman Jason Hemmings is usually satisfied when he finds a scallop, let alone a selection of historic coins

An amateur fisherman snared himself an unusual catch - a haul of Roman and Iron Age coins, hailed by the British Museum as a 'very excting discovery'.

Jason Hemmings usually spends his time plucking sea bass from the ocean. But, having recently bought a metal detector and taken up treasure hunting as a hobby, he struck gold in a field in Owermoigne, Dorset, finding 15 bronze and silver coins that may have been lying there for 2,000 years.

Mr Hemmings, 41, began his hobby when he purchased the detector for £300 from a friend who wanted to upgrade his own.

After scouring the field, he unearthed
the first coin and, initially, that seemed to be it. 'I had a quick 
search and couldn’t find anything else,' he said.

'I had to go home for Sunday roast. But I went back the next day, and that’s when I came across more.'

The
machine was giving off such faint, intermittent signals that his friend
did not think it was worth the effort of digging, but he persevered,. 
and the rest is history.

He followed the required 
procedure in reporting the discovery under the Portable Antiquities 
Scheme, which encourages the voluntary recording of archaeological 
objects found by members of the public in England and Wales.

The local finds liaison officer realised its significance immediately.

Although its financial value is low – just a few hundred pounds - the hoard is historically very important.

Exciting discovery: Two of the Roman coins found by Mr Hemmings, 41. These show the head of Tiberius

Pot luck: Mr Hemmings made the amazing discovery just weeks after he bought a metal detector from a friend for £300. The piece on the left shows the bare head of Claudius I

Impressive haul: In total, Mr Hemmings came across 15 coins - thought to have been dropped by a soldier some 2,000 years ago. The coin on the left features the head of Janus, the God of beginnings and transitions

Eleanor
Ghey, a British Museum expert, said the moeny is likely to have been 
dropped by a soldier at the time Romans first came to the country.

'These
coins are likely to be close in date to the conquest of Britain in AD 
43. They almost pinpoint the time when the Romans were first in Britain.
It’s one of the earliest things we have. This is a very exciting 
discovery.'

The coins - 
three different currencies all circulating in Britain in the middle of 
the first century AD - include large bronze coins of the Roman emperor 
Claudius issued between AD 41 and 50.

Proud: Mr Hemmings is going to make a trip to the British Museum, where his haul, believed to be worth a few hundred pounds, is being displayed

'Hoards which can be dated with confidence to the early years of the Claudian conquest are incredibly rare,' said Ms Ghey.

The
coins amount to 4.25 denarii which would have paid for about a week’s 
food for a soldier - one denarius would have bought eight loaves of 
bread.

The question of how 
and why coin hoards were buried in the Roman period is currently being 
investigated by a new research project at the British Museum and 
Leicester University.

Mr Hemmings is planning to visit the British Museum, where the coins have just gone on show in the Citi Money Gallery.
