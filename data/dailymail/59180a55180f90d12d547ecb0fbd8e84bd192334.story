Cheetahs have been found to use a mixture of stealth, speed and flexibility in a similar way to a race car overtaking.

To catch prey, a cheetah is required to accelerate, make sharp stops and turn rapidly. 

Race cars require similar tactics when overtaking or slowing down to negotiate a corner.

Animal type: Carnivorous mammal

Length of body: 1.1 to 1.5m

Length of tail: 60 to 80 cm long

Weight: 21 – 72kg

Habitat: Adapted to savannah or open grassland but also dense woodlands

Lifespan: Up to 17 years

John Wilson of North Carolina State University’s monitored speed, position and acceleration of six free-ranging cheetahs at Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, southern Africa.

Tracking was done using GPS devices and movement monitors on collars placed on the cheetahs, according to Jennifer Viegas from Discovery News.

Cheetahs, the world’s fastest running land mammals, have powerful back legs and muscles that allow them to run as fast as 75 miles per hour.

A long tail is used for balance and to help steering when making fast turns.

The
North Carolina State University study showed that, while cheetahs could
easily outrun their prey, this isn’t the tactic they use.

To catch prey, a cheetah is required to accelerate, make sharp stops and turn rapidly. Race cars require similar tactics when overtaking or slowing down when going into corners.

Instead they have an initial burst of speed followed by a period where they make rapid turns as they close in on their prey.

They then make a rapid stop as they pounce on their victim and devour their dinner.

‘Predator and prey thus pit a fine balance of speed against maneuvering capability in a race for survival,’ said John Wilson of North Carolina State University’s Department of Biology.

The study also looked at greyhounds and race horses, and found that these animals placed more emphasis on acceleration that a cheetah.

‘Much of a cheetah’s pursuit thus appears less of a high-speed rush, and more of a carefully played out life-or-death duel between predator and prey,’ said the researchers.
