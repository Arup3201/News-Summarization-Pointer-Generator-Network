An epileptic driver who killed a passenger in his car after he had a seizure while driving no longer has charges imposed against him.

In 2012 Vincent Zanfardino was charged with second-degree murder, criminally negligent homicide, and assault.

On Tuesday, Zanfardino was found not guilty by the Bronx Supreme Court  even though he was advised by his doctor not to drive.

Not guilty: Vincent Zanfordino , pictured here at the The Bronx Criminal Court on November 13th, was found not guilty for murder on Tuesday  for driving and crashing a car when he had an epileptic seizure 

Gothamist reports that Zanfardino's lawyer argued that being epileptic was not Zanfardino's fault and that New York State law allows people with epilepsy to drive.

Despite being on is medication, Zanfardino had an epileptic seizure while driving on the New England Thruway in the Bronx on July 11 of 2012.

Inside the car was Alfred Reitano, 25, who suffered a head injury and died the next day. Also in the car were Brynn Rohlf and her fiancé, Dylan Gardineer.

The New York Times  reports that in the state of New York people typically need to be seizure free for 12 months.

Mr. Zanfardino suffered from epilepsy since his 20s and took anti-seizure medication, but had still experienced an increasing number of seizures in the last few years.

He had been advised by his doctor on numerous occasions not to drive.

'My world as I know it is over,' Ms. Reitano said as she waited outside the courtroom earlier this month.

'Freddy was my firstborn son and he was the light of my life. Life will never be the same without him.'

'I don’t think he should have been driving if he knew the consequences,' she said of Zanfardino.

The New York Times reports that had Zanfardino been convicted he would have faced a penalty of between 5 to 25 years behind bars.
