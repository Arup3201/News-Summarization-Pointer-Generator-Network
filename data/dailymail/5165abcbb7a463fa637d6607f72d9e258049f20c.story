Peaches Geldof's baby son was found next to his mother's body after her husband raised the alarm when she wouldn't answer the phone, it has been reported.

The 25-year-old was looking after 11 month old Phaedra when she died suddenly and mysteriously at her home in Wrotham, Kent, it is claimed.

Her body was discovered after her rock singer husband Thomas Cohen, 23, raised the alarm when his wife would not answer her phone on Monday, The Sun reported.

He called a friend, who went over to the house to check on her and then called the police.

Bereft: The body of Peaches Geldof has been released to the family as her father Sir Bob has been spending time with her children Astala, 23 months, and Phaedra, 11 months, at the family home of husband Tom Cohen

Peaches' own mother Paula Yates was found dead in similar circumstances. When her body was discovered in her Notting Hill, west London home, in 2000, Peaches' four-year-old sister Tiger Lily was found playing nearby by a family friend.

A source close to the family spoke of their hope that the horrific episode will not leave the baby traumatised.

They told The Sun: 'The hope is that Phaedra was so young he wasn't aware of what was going on. The most important thing is that he's OK.

'It is devastating for Tom that he wasn't there but it couldn't have been avoided.'

Yesterday the nanny who became a surrogate 
mother to Peaches in the wake of Paula Yates's death paid tribute to her 'brave and beautiful girl'.

Anita Debney was employed by Sir Bob Geldof and Paula Yates to care for their children when Peaches was a toddler.

Speaking
 of her shock at the 25-year-old's sudden death on Monday, Ms Debney 
said. 'She has been the greatest joy, the greatest blessing, the most 
tender part of my heart and soul.

'I loved her through the good times and the bad. We struggled and survived the darkest of times.

'She overcame so much and my love and appreciation of her indomitable spirit never wavered.

'The
 joy we shared in her beautiful babies was so deep and meaningful and 
filled both of our hearts with love and devotion,' she told The Mirror. 'She blossomed in 
motherhood and excelled at raising the sweetest, happiest babies in the 
world... You almost made it.'

Ms Debney is expected to play a role in helping to bring up Peaches' two sons, and her godsons, Astala, 23 months, and Phaedra.

The emotional tribute came as Peaches' body was released to her family so they can plan her funeral.

It
 is expected to be held at the Kent church where she married in 2012 and
 where her mother Paula Yates' memorial service took place in 2000.

Peaches Geldof and her husband  were 'absolutely over the moon' when they welcomed Phaedra into the world

Grief: In 2000 Paula Yates' funeral was held at the church where her daughter would later marry

Her
 father Sir Bob Geldof has also been spending time with his grandchildren at Mr Cohen's father's home in New Eltham, south-east London.

The Kent coroner's announcement that they no longer hold Peaches' body means that her grieving family can now plan her funeral.

It could be held at St Mary Magdalene and St Lawrence in Davington, near Faversham, Kent,  where she married Mr Cohen, lead singer of the band S.C.U.M, in September 2012.

Her parents were also married at the church 26 years ago and it is where her mother Paula Yates' funeral was also held in 2000.

A source said: 'The church holds the 
most bittersweet of memories for the Geldof family. They have had the 
best of times and the worst of times in that churchyard.'

She was just 11 when her mother died 
after a heroin overdose. The last message she posted online on Sunday evening was a picture of her as a toddler
 with her mother.

Peaches had spoken of feeling the presence of her late mother keenly
 as she walked down the aisle of St Mary Magdalene and St Lawrence 
Church.

Speaking to 
Hello! magazine at the time of her wedding to Tom Cohen in 2012, she 
said: ‘I feel her [Yates] presence all the time but especially today. 
Mum loved family celebrations and she would adore Tom and the fact that 
we’ve married here. I know she is watching over me and feeling so happy 
for us.’

Peaches was found
 dead at her Kent country home on Monday in ‘unexplained’ circumstances 
and a post-mortem examination yesterday was 'inconclusive' about the 
cause.

'Inconclusive': A post mortem has been held at Darent Valley Hospital, in Dartford, Kent, but a cause of death was not established

A post-mortem examination carried out 
at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford proved inconclusive, prompting 
further investigations to try to establish her cause of death.

It
 is understood that police found no suicide note and no signs of injury 
or evidence of drugs.

Any inquest is not expected to be opened and adjourned by the coroner until after the results of the toxicology tests are known.

A
 spokesman for North West Kent coroner Roger Hatch said: 'We can confirm
 that the body has been released to the family for funeral arrangements 
to be made.'

Her father led the tributes which flooded in after her death.

In a touching tribute signed by Sir Bob, his partner Jeanne Marine, and Ms Geldof's sisters Fifi Trixibelle, Pixie and Tiger, they said the family was 'beyond pain', saying: 'She was the wildest, funniest, cleverest, wittiest and the most bonkers of all of us.'

Investigation: Police continue to scour Peaches Geldof's home in Wrotham, Kent, where she was found dead

Looking for clues: Forensic teams were spotted walking in and out of her home with trained sniffer dogs - but sources have said there was no signs of injury, drugs or a suicide note

Poignant: Peaches will have her funeral at the church of St Mary Magdalene and St Lawrence in Davington, Kent, where she was married and her mother Paula's funeral was also held

Mr Cohen said his wife was adored by him
 and their two sons, whom he would bring up 'with their mother in their 
hearts every day'.

Ms 
Geldof's elder sister Fifi posted a picture on Instagram of the two of 
them together when they were children, writing: 'My beautiful baby 
sister... Gone but never forgotten. I love you Peaches x.'

Peaches
 married US musician Max Drummey in Las Vegas in 2008, when she was 19, 
but the couple split amicably in February 2009 before divorcing in 2011.

A prolific tweeter, the final message she sent on Sunday was a picture of herself as a child with her mother, with the message 'Me and my mum'.

In a column for Mother & Baby magazine, she wrote that she was now 'happier than ever' after becoming a mother.

Advice: Peaches Geldof was warned by doctors in 2011, left, about her junk food diet, so she gave up eating McDonald's, pizza and chips every day and lost weight, pictured right just before her death

It emerged yesterday that Peaches ate 
McDonald's, pizza and chips every day until doctors warned that her junk
 food diet was putting her health at risk.

The
 25-year-old admitted before her death she had cholesterol problems in 
2011 and 'the heart of a 90-year-old gangster' so decided to lose 
weight.

Friends had
 said she looked thin before she died, leading to speculation her weight
 loss may have put pressure on her heart. She had said her juice diet 
helped her lose 11lb in a month.

'I
 had cholesterol and the doctors said stop eating s***. So I did. If you
 stop eating pizza and chips you then don't look like you used to,' she 
said at a film premiere in 2011.

'Do I really look that thin? Let's be honest. How did I do it? I just stopped eating McDonald's and f****** s*** every day.

'I
 used to eat s*** every single day. I used to wake up with my boyfriend 
and eat crap. I had the heart of a 90-year-old gangster.'
