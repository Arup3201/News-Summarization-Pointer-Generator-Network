Chinese doctors claim to have diagnosed a new mental illness - porn traumatic stress disorder.

The condition was defined after examining the case of a teenager who says his life was ruined by being exposed to pornography from the age of five.

Lei Chung, 16, used to live with his mother and father in a tiny one bedroom flat in the city of Dongguan in southern China's Guangdong Province.

Lei Chung, 16, has been diagnosed with what doctors say is a new mental illness - porn traumatic stress disorder. The condition was defined after the teenager said his life had been ruined by being exposed to pornography from the age of five

He claims that at the age of five, he would lie awake at night and stare at his father using the computer on the table next to his bed to watch porn movies.

He told doctors: 'I tried not to look, but there were always these noises - and when I did look I couldn't get the images out of my head.'

He claims that when he asked his father not to watch such material, he had beaten him, and the situation at home had become even worse. 

The images have haunted him ever since.

It is reported that despite starting out well at school, he was unable to get the graphic images out of his head.

As a result, his school work suffered, leading to him eventually dropping out.

He was also unable to get a job because the porn images had constantly been floating around in his mind.  

His despair at the graphic images inside his mind led to him quitting school and trying to commit suicide

In the end he tried to commit suicide, but was persuaded out of it by a friend who urged him to seek medical advice.

Doctors have now confirmed the pornographic films that have haunted the boy through his life are to blame for his suffering.

However instead of post-traumatic stress disorder, they have branded it porn traumatic stress disorder.

Doctor Yi Tu, who has been treating Lei, said: 'It is a clear case proving that the exposure of young children to pornographic material before they really have the capacity to understand it is seriously damaging to their mental health. 

'Parents should take steps to make sure children are not exposed to this sort of imagery and especially not at such a young age.'
