A huge landslide completely blocked a highway and took a house with following heavy rains in the south western Chinese province of Guangxi.

As the ground gave way, mud and rocks tumbled down the hill completely covering the normally busy highway below.

The house, right on top of the landslide, broke up as the ground gave way, and the debris was swept away with the mud.

News website KXAN reported the slip had also manage to wreck part of a communications station that stood in its path.

People were pictured standing and watching the dramatic incident, which took place on Wednesday. It is not known if there were any casualties.

Police cordoned off the scene and cars backed up for nearly two miles along what is considered one of the most important roads for the area.
