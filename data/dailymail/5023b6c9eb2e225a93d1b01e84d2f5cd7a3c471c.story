The teenagers – the youngest of whom was just 13 when the robbery took place – left their shopkeeper victim so terrified that he is no longer able to leave the house alone.

They can be named after a judge lifted reporting restrictions due to the seriousness of their offence.

A court heard how the gang discussed plans to steal Crunk Juice, an strong alcoholic energy drink, from a newsagent’s. Daniel Flint, aged 15 at the time, sent a text to Joshua Quinn, 14, saying: ‘We are going to rob him for his crunk juice and fags, you on it?’

The court was told Joshua Quinn (left), 14, was from a 'very good family', while Jordan Tennant (right), 16, felt a 'deep sense of shame' for what he had done

Bystander: Billy Woodford, now 15, was described as having a tendency to 'lose his way'

On June 30 Billy Woodford, 14 at the 
time, and Flint entered the News, Food and Wine shop in Southampton, 
posing as customers.

They were followed by Quinn, Jordan Tennant, 16, 
and Iain Crook, then 13, who used hats and scarves to cover their faces.

Quinn, who already has one GCSE and 
was taking five more a year early, pointed a gun at father- of-two 
Gurdeep Singh and demanded cigarettes.

Simon Privett, prosecuting, said 
Crook, another promising pupil in his school’s top sets, told Mr Singh 
to ‘put all the fags in the bag, cash as well’.

The gang then left and divided up £140
in cash, 300 cigarettes and five packets of tobacco. The boys, who did 
not have a previous conviction between them, carried out the 
unsophisticated raid in 70 seconds.

All five were arrested on the same day
and charged with robbery, which they all admitted. Police discovered a 
series of text messages between them plotting the raid and, in the days 
afterwards, discussing alibis and how to dispose of the weapon, an 
antique 1950s air gun found by Quinn’s stepfather years earlier.

Mr Singh told officers he thought he 
would be shot, while Mr Privett told Southampton Crown Court that he has
suffered from flashbacks and nightmares, and is unable to leave the 
house on his own.

Judge Patrick Hooton said the crime 
was of such seriousness that he had no option other than custody, and 
handed down five 18-month sentences.

‘I have heard your mitigation that any
term of custody would be catastrophic for you,’ he said. ‘But the 
effect of what you did to Mr Singh is already catastrophic.’

American-made Crunk Juce (short for Crazy drunk) is an alcoholic energy drink that is as strong as wine.

Police have had growing reports of drinkers on ‘Crunk’ being involved in criminal incidents.

Inspector Phil Bates, of Southampton Police, said in June that it is clearly becoming popular since the rise in advertising campaigns for Crunk.

Crunk Juice, spelt with an i, is a cocktail consisting of red bull and Hennessy brandy supposedly invented by American rapper Lil Jon.

Crunk - short for crazy drunk - is a name given to a type of hip hop music produced by Lil Jon and his group the East Side Boyz.

Jon has previously endorsed a non-alcoholic energy drink simply called Crunk.

But last year the manufacturers launched Crunk Juce - which is packed with alcohol.

The 12 per cent drink is available in three flavours - fruit punch, grape and watermelon.

Consuming just one can is the equivalent of drinking a pint of wine mixed with an energy drink such as Red Bull.
