The female zookeeper mauled to death by tigers entered their enclosure on one of their ‘starvation days’, it was revealed yesterday.

As the mystery surrounding Sarah McClay’s death deepened, it also emerged that just days before she was killed she changed her Facebook profile picture to one of a painting of a face slashed by claws.

Police have not ruled out the possibility that the 24-year-old committed suicide by walking into the tiger enclosure at the animal park.

Police have not ruled out possibility zookeeper Sarah McClay, pictured on a night out, committed suicide

This picture from Disney's Beauty And The Beast was posted on her Facebook days before she died

Miss McClay suffered ‘very traumatic’ 
head and neck injuries in the attack and went into cardiac arrest. 
Although resuscitated by paramedics, she died in hospital.

The zoo owner said the keeper failed 
to follow the ‘strict protocol’ of radioing for permission to enter the 
enclosure before opening the padlock and two slide bolts.

He said it was ‘inexplicable’ that she
then went inside without ensuring the Sumatran tigers, Padang and 
Alisha, were locked away.

Keepers are required to enter the 
enclosures in the course of their duties. But each one contains a number
of compartments and an elaborate system of gates which should mean the 
animals and their keepers remain apart at all times.

Days before her death, Miss McClay 
changed her Facebook picture to a still from the 1991 Disney animation 
Beauty and the Beast, which shows a portrait in ribbons after being 
slashed by claws.

A police source said: ‘It is something
the investigation is looking at as a whole as the victim apparently 
ignored all her safety training before stepping into an enclosure 
containing two lethal predators. 

Miss McClay was described as a happy, bubbly woman who loved her job at the animal park

Zoo owner David Gill said neither the park or the tiger was to blame for the death of keeper Sarah McClay

Miss McClay died after being attacked by a tiger at South Lakes Wild Animal Park. One of the park's tigers is pictured

'She didn’t radio for permission and 
she didn’t let anyone know she was going in. She did this despite having
been the keeper of the tigers for well over a year and had been very 
experienced.’

After Miss McClay entered the 
enclosure on Friday, staff at South Lakes Wild Animal Park, in 
Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria, heard a scream over the radio and ran to the
scene, where they found the two tigers on top of her.

Park owner David Gill, 42, said 
Padang, the male Sumatran, had instigated the attack.

He added that at 
the time Padang and Alisha were on what is known as a ‘starve day’, when
they are not fed – to mimic conditions in the wild where tigers may go 
for some time without catching any prey.

‘The males are twice the size of the females and Padang had taken control,’ Mr Gill said.

He fired two shots with a rifle to 
scare away the animals, but Miss McClay, who lived with her boyfriend in
Barrow-in-Furness, had already suffered serious injuries.

Last night police said they had not 
ruled out suicide, but had so far failed to find any evidence to suggest
that was the motive for entering the enclosure.

Detective Chief Inspector Bob Qazi 
said: ‘There is no suggestion of any foul play or any issue of suicide 
or self-harm from the enquiries we have made and evidence we have.

‘What has become apparent from our 
inquiries with witnesses is that Sarah was going about her routine 
duties and was in the staff section of the enclosure building, which 
animals are not allowed access to, when a tiger has entered it from an 
adjacent pen and confronted her.

Miss McClay’s family yesterday praised
paramedics and hospital staff for ‘valiant efforts’ to save her life, 
adding: ‘We are still coming to terms with what has happened.’

Park owner David Gill said Miss McClay was a happy, bubbly girl who was good at her job
