Mario Balotelli was engulfed in another controversy as he became Liverpool’s match-winner in the most dramatic fashion. 

The Italy striker grabbed the ball from captain Jordan Henderson to take an 84th-minute penalty — a decision that led the injured Steven Gerrard, who was working as a pundit for ITV, to accuse Balotelli of being ‘a bit disrespectful’ to Henderson. 

Henderson and Daniel Sturridge both appeared to be angry as Balotelli took the ball but he stepped up to score — the 27th successful conversion of his career — and ensure Liverpool have a 1-0 lead to take Istanbul for the second leg of their round of the 32 tie.

In an attempt to defuse the row which millions watched on television, Balotelli later said on Instagram: ‘Thank you hendo for let me take the penalty. Stop drama now. We won that’s what counts.’ 

The incident echoed what happened at Goodison Park on January 19 when Kevin Mirallas took the ball from Leighton Baines but missed from 12 yards against West Bromwich.

Brendan Rodgers would not clarify whether Henderson was the designated penalty-taker but Gerrard said: ‘Mario’s been a bit mischievous by going against what the manager has planned.

‘Credit to him — he’s finished the penalty off but it would’ve been very interesting in that dressing room if he had missed. I think we would have had a similar situation to what we had at Everton a couple of weeks ago.

But Balotelli scored from the spot to give Liverpool a 1-0 win late on in the Europa League tie

Steven Gerrard said that Balotelli was 'disrespectful' towards Henderson in the ITV Studio

‘Rules are rules and codes are codes inside a dressing room and when a manager selects a penalty-taker, that penalty-taker should take it. It should’ve been Henderson but fair play to Mario, who was terrific when he came on.

‘With the pressure on his shoulders he slotted it away very well and it’s a big goal for us.

‘Jordan has handled the situation very well. He’s known Mario wants the penalty really badly and is desperate to get on the scoresheet and he’s stepped away at the right time.’

Rodgers said of the penalty, which was won by Jordon Ibe when he was taken down by Ramon Motta: ‘Steven should have taken it! We got the win. We have a number of outstanding penalty-takers.’
