After divorcing her husband three years ago, Pauline Potter - already a whopping 46stone - piled on so much extra weight she became the heaviest woman in the world, weighing in at 50stone (700lb).

But for ex-husband Alex (a svelte 11stone), it only made her even more irresistible.

When he saw she had clinched the Guinness World Record for her enormous size, Mr Potter rushed to move back in with his former partner in Sacramento, California.

Their big day: Pauline and Alex Potter were married in 2003 (above) when she weighed 43stone. After getting divorced five years later, she piled on even more pounds, reaching over 50stone

Sensual: The couple got back together after Alex saw she had become the heaviest woman in the world. Today, Mrs Potter (seen here in a recent picture) cannot walk or wash herself, but the pair say their sex life is amazing

Mrs Potter, whose weight at its peak has now reached 52 stone, told The Sun: 'Most women think losing weight is the way to get their ex's attention - but for me it was just the opposite.

'Becoming the world's heaviest woman is what made him fall in love with me all over again and we're now working on getting our relationship back on track.'

The 47-year-old is now so big she cannot get around - but she is still dynamite in bed, her ex-husband told the newspaper.

'She can't walk, dress herself or even go to the toilet on her own - but I'm desperate to be her lover and caretaker again,' he said.

'I miss our sex life. Pauline could be 70st and we'd still have sex every single day because it's that good.

Super-sized: The 52st woman eats a whopping 10,000 calories every day and said she contacted the Guinness Book of Records to 'humiliate' herself into getting fit

'Within the first day of being back together, we had sex six times in 24 hours.

'Even though one of Pauline's legs weighs more than I do, we're able to position her body to make sex enjoyable for both of us.'

The couple rekindled their romance on holiday in Los Angeles, according to the newspaper, but he admitted that their love was not without its obstacles.

'It's really dangerous for us to have sex because at any moment the bed could collapse and one of us could be seriously injured or even killed from the impact,' said the 46-year-old.

Comfort food: Overweight Mrs Potter and her son Dillon stock up on snacks

Mrs Potter admitted her ex-husband had to do most of the work in bed, but added: 'It helps that I did gymnastics until I was 12 so I'm very limber.'

The couple first married in 2003, when Mrs Potter and her son Dillon, 19, moved to Phoenix, Arizona, to live with Mr Potter and his son Sherman, now 21.

But Mrs Potter said her relationship with Sherman was poor from the start, and in 2008 she filed for divorce and moved back to Sacramento.

It was then that the devastated woman began stuffing her face with Big Macs, milkshakes, biscuits and cake.

She was soon consuming 10,000 calories a day, according to The Sun, where the recommended allowance for a woman is 2,000.

Junk food addicts: Mrs Potter tucks into crisps, eclairs and fried food with Dillon

Dillon - himself four stone overweight at 18st - become her carer, cooking and bathing his mother, who cannot get out of her electric bed.

'The turning point was when I had to ask Dillon to help me to get dressed,' said Mrs Potter, who gets $850 (Â£540) a month in benefits. 'I now need him to pull everything up because I can't reach behind myself.

'It also takes me an hour to shower because I have to reach my hose under each and every fat fold. It's exhausting.'

Eventually, Mrs Potter decided she had to take action before she killed herself, and contacted the Guinness Book of Records

'I figured I needed to publicly humiliate myself in order to help myself.'

She is now determined to slim down so 
they can try for a little girl.

'My goal is to lose 200lb (14st 4lb) 
plus and have weight-loss surgery so I can be mobile again and not rely 
on anyone for help,' she said.
