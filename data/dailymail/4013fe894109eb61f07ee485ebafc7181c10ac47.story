With large eyes staring out behind his brilliantly painted face this young child is a proud member of one of east Africa's most fascinating tribal groups.

His face decorated with coloured clay and a crown of greenery topping his little head, the youngster belongs to one of the tribes living in the remote Omo Valley, tucked away beyond the towns and cities of modern life.

This incredible set of pictures allows a glimpse into the lost world of the Omo tribes, who live peacefully and close to nature in one of the most far flung, yet beautiful parts of the world.

The tribes people's way of life is largely untainted by modern life, although the extent to which some of the bleaker elements of civilisation are creeping into their world is apparent in another photograph in which a young boy, his body and face decorated with clay paint poses proudly with a toy gun made of wood.

The incredible photographs which capture the way of life for the 200,000 tribal people who call the lower Omo Valley home were taken by photographer Hans Silvester and have been published in a new book: 'Natural Fashion: Tribal Decoration from Africa', published by Thames and Hudson.

The book highlights the ways of the Omo tribes who live close to nature with their painted faces, scarified bodies and extravagant headdresses with plants and feathers cleverly combined.
