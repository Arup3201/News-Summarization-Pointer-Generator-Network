Hull City manager Steve Bruce is excited by new signing Hatem Ben Arfa, and is confident he can get the best out of the mercurial French winger. 

Bruce brought in the playmaker  on a loan deal from Newcastle on transfer deadline day after Ben Arfa fell out with the club's manager Alan Pardew and was sent to train with their youth and reserve team players.

The Frenchman is short of match fitness, and is unlikely to feature in Hull's clash against West Ham on Monday, but the Tigers' manager Bruce has vowed to get the best out of the inconsistent midfielder.

Bruce told Sky Sports: 'I don't think he's fit enough to go straight in at the start because he hasn't played 90 minutes for I don't know how long.

'But that's what you get when you've been ostracised, having to work with the Under 21s. 

'He's going to have a big part to play here because he gives us the flexibility to play whatever formation we like.

'All I want him to do is go out there and enjoy playing again, feel wanted, be part of the club and be appreciated.'

Sportsmail understands  meanwhile that Bruce is keen on leaving Hull to become the Newcastle manager, if, as expected, current boss Alan Pardew is sacked.
