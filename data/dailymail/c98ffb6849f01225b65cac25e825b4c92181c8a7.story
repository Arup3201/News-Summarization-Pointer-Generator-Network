Alan Pardew protested it was only the result that mattered in his first match against Newcastle since he quit the North-East — but the manner in which he celebrated Fraizer Campbell’s equaliser suggested it meant more to him than that.

The 53-year-old was delighted after substitutes Yannick Bolasie and Campbell combined to cancel out Papiss Cisse’s first-half header.

But the game was tarnished as a coin thrown from the stands hit Fabricio Coloccini, which furious Newcastle manager John Carver claimed could have blinded his defender.

As Newcastle players gathered in front of the Holmesdale End to revel in Cisse’s 42nd-minute goal, their captain recoiled after being hit on the forehead and referee Andre Marriner collected the missile.

‘It’s got to be taken out of the game,’ said Carver. ‘It’s a shame because they have fantastic support here. 

But I saw it and it missed his eye by an inch. It could have blinded him. Let’s find who it was and sort it out.’

Winger Bolasie, making his first appearance since helping DR Congo to third in the Africa Cup of Nations, transformed the game after his introduction on 68 minutes. 

He made a superb charge down the right and crossed for Campbell to slot past Tim Krul from six yards on 72 minutes.

‘Yannick’s cross was of the highest order,’ said Pardew, ‘I just came here and tried to get three points knowing Newcastle had some very good players. That was my only focus. It was nice to see both sets of players apply themselves in a good manner. A draw was fair.’

Pardew’s four years on Tyneside are viewed with mixed emotions. Newcastle supporters in the Arthur Wait Stand made it evident there is no love lost.

Pardew, however, was in conciliatory mode, devoting his programme notes to defending his fiery spell at St James’ Park. 

He made a beeline for his former players on the opposite bench before kick-off and embraced Carver.

Led by the Crystal Palace Ultras, abuse from the away end was drowned out by chants of ‘Super Alan Pardew’. And the home side dominated the early stages.

Yaya Sanogo started on his own up front but limped off after 25 minutes and was replaced by Campbell.

The striker thought he had given Palace the lead on 35 minutes after heading past Krul but the assistant referee rightly ruled him offside.

Newcastle went ahead with their first moment of quality, Cisse recording his 10th goal of the season. 

Daryl Janmaat did superbly on the right, chasing the ball into the corner and shrugging off Wilfried Zaha to whip the ball in for the Senegalese to powerfully head home from eight yards.

Palace almost snatched a late winner but Krul repelled Brede Hangeland’s header.
