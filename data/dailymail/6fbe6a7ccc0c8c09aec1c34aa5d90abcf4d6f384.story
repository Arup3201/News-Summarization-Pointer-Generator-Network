A parking space just big enough for a family car in a tiny village has gone on the market for an eye-watering £25,000.

Several offers have already come in for the unmarked spot in North Parade, Portscatho, Cornwall.

Many of the houses in the village have no parking of their own and there has not been a parking space on sale in Portscatho in the last 10 years.

The parking space in Portscatho, Cornwall has gone on the market for £25,000 - £3,000 more than the average salary in the region

With the average salary in Cornwall at just over £22,000 the parking space will be well out of reach for most locals, but the picture postcard village has a high number of holiday homes for which parking is at a premium.

According to Michelle Jeffery, from Alastair Shaw estate agents, which is marketing the parking space, guaranteed parking could add twice its purchase price to the value of a property.

'It is on the market for the price that someone thinks it is worth,' she said.

'But if you had a property here already and then had a parking space as well it could increase the value of your property by £50,000.

'We have had some interest in the space - and offers above the £25,000 - but we are leaving it open at the moment as we are coming into the season which is the prime time when there will be more people around.'

The car parking space has been marketed as: 'A very rare opportunity to acquire this car parking space that is conveniently located down in the middle of the village and within a stone's throw of the beach.

'The parking space is within close proximity of properties along The Lugger, North Parade and within The Square, Portscatho. There is room within the space to park one vehicle.

'Parking spaces rarely become available within the village and we recommend any interest to be registered with us as soon as possible.'

The village of Portscatho offers a range of shops including village shop, butchers, art galleries, public house, social club, restaurant, post office and doctors surgery.
