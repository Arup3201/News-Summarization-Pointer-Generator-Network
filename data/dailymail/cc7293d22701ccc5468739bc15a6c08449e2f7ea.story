A bearded mother-of-two who hid under a niqab to stop her children from being bullied over her goatee has revealed her face to the public for the first time in 19 years.

Indonesian Agustina Dorman, 38, began sprouting thick facial hair after the birth of her first child when she was just 25.

Ever since she has hidden her face under a traditional Muslim niqab whenever outside in Penaga village, Indonesia, to prevent her children from being bullied.

But Agustina has decided to ditch the clothing and accept her condition - regardless of the stares and unwanted attention she now attracts.

Brave: Agustina Dorman, 38, has decided to stop wearing a niqab to hide her facial hair after 19 years

Standing up for herself: Agustina Dorman had worn the niqab so her children wouldn't be bullied about her condition but she has now decided to go without and face her tormenters

Agustina - who also sports a mild 
moustache and chest hair - says that whenever she attempted to cut or 
shave the beard she experienced unbearable pain.

After several attempts to rid herself of the goatee, she was forced to let it grow.

And scared that her children - aged 
19 and three - would be bullied for their mother's appearance, Agustina 
hid away under the niqab.

Among Indonesia's large Muslim population, Agustina could move about without attracting unwanted attention.

But she says her eldest child began to receive taunts from others who found out about their mother's unusual condition.

It led the brave mother-of-two to confront her children's tormentors by unveiling herself and freely walking around their village for the first time this week.

She hopes that through education about her condition, people will become accepting of her appearance.

Earlier this year a German bearded lady called Mariam appeared on Daytime TV in the UK to reveal she even felt sexy with her stubble.

Unbearable: Agustina Dorman, who lives on Bintan Island in Indonesia, tried to remove the hair by cutting it and shaving but found it too painful

Bullied: Agustina, who has had the beard since she was 25, said she decided to stop wearing the niqab and face any criticism after her eldest son was taunted by bullies about her condition
