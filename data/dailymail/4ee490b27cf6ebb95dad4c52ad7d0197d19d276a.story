Two fearless skydivers jumped from an altitude of 33,000ft - high enough to see the curvature of the Earth.

Skydivers Fréderic Fugen, 34, and Vincent Reffet, 29, leapt from a plane in the freezing skies above Mont-Blanc in the Alps - the largest mountain in Europe.

They jumped from such a height - commercial airliners cruise at an altitude between 30,000 and 40,000 feet on long haul flights - that they had to use a specially designed oxygen system to stop them from passing out.

The pair from Annecy, France performed 40 seconds of free fall acrobatics as they plummeted through the air at 250mph.

The daredevil divers opened their canopies as they reached 20,000 feet and skimmed past the sides of the magnificent mountain range.

The jump, which lasted seven minutes, was completed when both men landed safely in Courmayeur, Italy.

'It was a combination of different skydiving technics and many years of training,' said Fred

It took Frederic and Vincent a year and a half to prepare for the final jump which took place this summer.

The technical side of the jump required months of meticulous planning and intensive training in Austria and Spain.

Fred said: 'It has been a dream to complete high altitude freeflying and a huge mountain swoop above the highest European mountain.

'It was a combination of different skydiving technics and many years of training.

'First there was high altitude freefly maneuvers from 33,000ft until 20,000ft and then a long mountain swoop from 15,800ft until the 4000ft landing.

'It was a huge achievement and I'm so happy we were able to do it safely in the way we wanted.'
