Rare leopard spot fish have been bred in an aquarium for the first time ever.

The colourful leopard spot goby fish, which are covered in bright red and orange spots, were virtually unknown around the British coast until the introduction of modern scuba equipment.

But now they have been successfully bred for the first time in captivity at the Blue Reef Aquarium in Newquay, Devon and staff are hopeful the tiny hatchlings will continue to thrive.

Jenny Youngs, who is rearing the hatchlings at the aquariums nursery said: 'Leopard spot gobies are definitely one of the most attractive of our native species.

'Their bright markings are all the more unusual as most other members of the goby family are far more drably coloured to match their rocky or sandy habitat.

'We're looking after literally hundreds of microscopic hatchlings with even more due to hatch out any day.

'We have a group of four adults here at Blue Reef but this is the first time they have bred. As far as we know the species is not on display anywhere else in the UK so we think this is actually a first.'

The species is thought to be native to the south west of England, with further populations reported in the north east of the country.

The leopard spot goby lives in shallow seas below the low water mark in rocky areas and are occasionally found in rockpools.

In the wild they feed on small crustaceans and other tiny invertebrates.

Although records are scarce, experts believe the fish breed in the spring and are relatively short-lived - apparently dying once they have spawned.
