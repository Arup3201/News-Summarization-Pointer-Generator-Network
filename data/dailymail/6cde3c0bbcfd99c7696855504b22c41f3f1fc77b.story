Tourists are risking their lives to visit the 'blue fires' of Indonesia's Kawah ljen volcano after dark.

The active volcano, part of the ljen string of volvanoes in East Java, releases sulphuric gas which ignites to send electric blue flames five metres into the night skies. The burning sulphur, which looks red during the day, pours down the sides of the volcano like neon lava at night. 

And although officially off limits, the light shows are drawing international crowds, with visitors paying local sulphur miners to take them deep into the crater after the sun goes down.

More than a dozen, mostly miners and one foreign tourist, have reportedly died from the poisonous sulphur fumes over the last thirty years.

The local miners, who rely on the sulphur for their livelihoods, work in the heat of the bottom of the crater to collect the material without protections. They run ceramic  pipes  from the side of the mountain to collect the highly toxic molten chemical before it is cooled, broken up and carried away for sale. 

The crater lake is said to be the most toxic of its kind in the world, with a similar ph level to that of battery acid.

Indonesia's Kawah ljen volcano emits dangerous sulphur chemicals, which are collected by local miners. The crater floor is pure sulphur and extremely toxic

At least a dozen people, mostly local miners, have been killed by exposure to the toxic 'Blue Fire' fumes
