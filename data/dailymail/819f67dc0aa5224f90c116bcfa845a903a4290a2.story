Mia Farrow has been ridiculed after posting a birthday message to one of her daughters – with a picture of her beneath the search term ‘Mia Farrow and her black children’.

The photograph was of Quincy Farrow, who’s just turned 21, and was quickly replaced by a new photograph with the search term removed.

However, Twitter users had already taken a screen shot of the gaffe.

Mia Farrow has been ridiculed after posting a birthday message to one of her daughters – with a picture of her beneath the search term ‘Mia Farrow and her black children’

The actress later reposted the picture  - and claimed that it was an image she'd taken herself that had been sent to her along with the unfortunate search term

Nick Carbone tweeted the picture with the message: ‘You’d think Mia Farrow would have a photo of her daughter without having to Google it… with such an awkward search.’

The 69-year-old actress has 15 children – four from husbands Andre Previn and Woody Allen and 11 adopted, and quickly denied that she finds photographs of her loved ones by using internet searches.

She claims that the picture in question was one she took – but that the one she posted was sent to her  and she used that in her Twitter feed, according to the New York Observer.

She wrote: ‘I took the photo myself & posted it before. Then someone sent it to me & I didn't check source.’

Ronan Farrow last year described on the Late Show with Jimmy Fallon what it was like growing up with 12 siblings.

'I had siblings from South Asia, from East Asia, from depressed communities around America, and you know, we'd have long conversations,' Farrow recalled.

The young TV presenter shared an amusing anecdote involving Quincy and another who is blind. 

'My sister Quincy, who is black, would get called the N-word at school and we'd talk for hours, and my sister Frankie, who's blind, would chime in an hour into conversation about race, "Wait, Quincy's black?"' Farrow recounted to peals of laughter from the audience.

‘Still haven't told her what color I am.' 

Mia's 12-year-relationship with Allen ended when she discovered he'd begun a relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, whom he married in 1997.

Mia recently won praise for her Broadway role in Love Letters, which closed in December. 

She wowed the critics with her moving turn in the bittersweet play by A.R. Gurney that follows two main characters, Melissa and Andrew, as they read aloud letters spanning from childhood to adulthood.
