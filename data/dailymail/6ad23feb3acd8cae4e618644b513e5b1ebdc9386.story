Michael Swales leaving court at an earlier appearance. Today he escaped jail despite admitting stealing £4,200 from a pensioner to fund his drug habit 

A drug addict who stole thousands of pounds from a pensioner has escaped jail after his victim forgave him and even left his home to him in his will.

Michael Swales, 41, stole more than £4,000 from 72-year-old family friend Trevor Barker after learning the pensioner had been storing the cash under his mattress to pay for his funeral.

Retired factor worker Mr Barker, who has no children and lives alone in Nelson, Lancashire, acted as a friend to Swales for 25 years since meeting him as a 16-year-old when he arrived at the textile factory where he worked.

Mr Barker, who also uses a chairlift, treated Swales like a son, letting him lodge at his house and then bought him a new sofa and kitchenware when he got his own flat in Colne, Lancashire.

At Burnley Crown Court, Swales admitted theft but was sentenced to eight months in jail, suspended for two years, with 12 months supervision.

He was also ordered to take part in a nine month drugs programme after the victim offered to take him in again.

Mr Barker, who watched from the public gallery as Swales was ordered to also pay £250 compensation, said after the hearing: 'You've got to give people a chance. I shall help him.

'He has always been a nice lad, he has just fallen by the wayside. There will always be a place for Michael at my home. When I die, he gets my house in trust.'

Earlier the court heard Mr Barker, who suffers from arthritis, was a friend of the Swales since he was 16 when they worked at Smith and Nephew.

Around 18 months before the theft, Swales’ father Derek had turned up at Mr Barker’s door and asked if his son could stay with him.

The victim agreed and put Swales up in his front bedroom for around nine months during which he told him had been saving up for his funeral with Brierfield Co-op and had saved about £6,000.

He told Swales that if anything should happen to him, it was kept in a money bag between two mattresses on his bed. Mr Barker needed two mattresses to assist him to get in bed. The money bag was pushed in deep between the two mattresses.

Prosecutor David Clarke said Swales eventually moved out but on December 2 last year, he returned to the house and told Mr Barker he needed to go upstairs to find his mobile phone which he falsely claimed was missing.

He went up to the bedroom and took £4,250, leaving about £1,200 with the band around it.

Mr Clarke explained: 'It seems Mr Barker, who uses a stairlift, only subsequently got to the top of the stairs.

'The defendant left almost immediately, saying he had not found the phone. Mr Barker looked around and made the discovery. '

Swales was arrested on December 8 and said he had been well aware what the money was for but he had fallen into a drugs habit.

Mr Clarke continued: 'He said he had a debt of around £200 or so and he took this money to be used to pay off the drugs debt and taxi fares when he went in taxis to collect more drugs as his addiction took hold of him.

'He said at the end of the interview he was ashamed of himself.'

In his victim impact statement, Mr Barker said the theft had made him 'feel ill and sick to his stomach.'

He added: 'I am devastated. I could break down and cry. Michael knew he could talk to me, but he has stolen money from me. I have not slept since. I feel in shock, like I have flu.

'This has made his parents very upset and angry. They feel guilty, but I have told them they should not. He is an adult and is responsible for his own actions. '

But the court heard Mr Barker had taken a benevolent view of the overall situation and whilst wishing Swales to be punished agreed to offer him accommodation.

In mitigation defence counsel Philip Holden said Swales’ remorse was 'genuine' and he was on a course of methadone.

Mr Holden urged the judge to suspend the sentence of imprisonment which, he said, was merited.

He added: 'It would, in my submission, provide the most constructive disposal for a man who is assessed as a low risk of offending and a low risk of causing serious harm.

'The defendant is perhaps fortunate that the unfortunate victim of this case has come along today and made the very fair comments that he has.'

Passing sentence, Judge Jonathan Gibson said Swales’ actions had been a 'gross breach of trust' when the victim had shown him nothing but kindness and support.

Judge Gibson said of Mr Barker: 'One can only sympathise with what he said in his statement.

'He must have suffered very great shock and one can understand
