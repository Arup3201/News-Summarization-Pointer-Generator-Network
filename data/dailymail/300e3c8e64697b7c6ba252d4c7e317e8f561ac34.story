Over-dependent? The survey of children across Europe found that many in the UK had a constant urge to check their phones, with some even sacrificing family time to go online

Almost two thirds of British nine to 16-year-olds admit problematic use of their smartphone, including an over-dependence on their mobiles, a new study has found.

The survey of children across Europe found that many in the UK had a constant urge to check their phones, with some even sacrificing family time to go online.

Others said they had missed out of sleeping or eating because of their internet use, with more British children reporting issues with their smartphone use than their European counterparts.

The Net Children Go Mobile study is produced by the EU Kids 
Online research programme at LSE university and looks at the internet 
habits of children across 25 EU countries.

Although the report found that British children have embraced the smartphone more 
than children in other countries surveyed, researchers found that with their increased usage came a greater 
number of issues.

Some 65 per cent of the children surveyed said they had experienced at least two forms of excessive use, compared with 57 per cent in Portugal, 50 per cent in Italy and only 34 per cent in Belgium.

Most notable was the two-thirds of children who said they had a strong need to keep checking theirphone for anything new, while almost half feel bothered when they cannot check it.

A similar number said they had checked their devices in places where they should not have.

'When it’s in the night, I’ll go under the covers and start playing games or looking at my pictures to delete, things like that,' said one nine-year-old young respondent, Angela.

Children reported that the main benefit of having a smartphone was feeling more connected to their friends, although one in three said they felt they must always be available for contact, either via text message, social media or services such as WhatsApp.

One 12-year-old, Emma, said: 'It's worse on WhatsApp, I say, because there are groups, and then say I went for dinner there’d be like 100 messages and you just can’t be bothered to read them, and then you miss something.'

Lifeline: Researchers reported finding that children and adolescents viewed their phones as ¿extensions¿ of their body, that can carried around with them throughout the day

One-quarter
 of children say they miss eating or sleeping because of their use of 
the internet, and nearly two-thirds say that the internet gets in the 
way of time they should spend with family, friends or schoolwork – a 
higher figure than for others in Europe.

Researchers reported finding that children and adolescents viewed their phones as ‘extensions’ of their body, that can carried around with them throughout the day.

Older teenagers, particularly boys, were more likely to report problematic behaviour, although some almost a third of children aged nine and ten said they worried about excessive use.

The report writers concluded: 'The UK still leads in terms of measures of excessive internet use, although the rest of Europe appears to be ‘catching up’ in this regard.

'Still, UK children are increasingly reporting the negative consequences of excessive internet useover time.

'While
 UK children embrace smartphones more, and are more positive about their
 benefits (especially for keeping in touch with friends), smartphones 
clearly have their downsides too; forexample, a third of children felt the pressure to be available for contact through these devices, andmore children in the UK than across Europe are also now reporting a range of negative consequences.'

Sonia Livingstone, one of the report's 
authors, that childrens' constant internet use made them unable to escape bullies.

In 2013, 21 per cent of children in Britain aged nine to 16 had been bullied, with more girls than boys reporting being picked on. 

For the first time, more youths said they were cyber bullied (12 per cent) than picked on face to face (9 per cent ), with social networking sites such as Facebook being the most common forum for online taunts.

There has also been a sharp spike in the 
number of youngsters who are exposed to hate messages, self-harm and 
pro-anorexia websites, according to the research.

'Bullying is happening both ways,' said Professor Livingstone.

'It is happening at school and when they go home they are on Facebook and targeted. It is really hard to escape. That is the new phenomenon. Kids are on their Facebook 24/7.

'There is research that shows that if cyber bullying is anonymous then it is easier to lash out at others. And on the internet, people might think they are just having a bit of a laugh, but you can't see how the person on the other side is really feeling and responding.

'The internet is so fast, so bullying messages and images that are put out there can spread so quickly it is hard to contain them and it can escalate.'

She said the internet 'can be part of the solution' and called on teachers and parents to better educate young people to the dangers of the web.

Shaun Kelly, head of safeguarding at Action for Children, said: 'Young people's increasing exposure to negative user-generated content, such as bullying via social media or sites about self-harming, is a sobering reminder of the potential risks to children online.

'Increased smartphone and tablet usage means parents and teachers cannot always supervise young people's activity, however talking to young people about internet use can effectively build resilience and protect against potentially damaging or disturbing content.

'Adults must show an interest in all aspects of young people's online activities, not just when they are concerned.'
