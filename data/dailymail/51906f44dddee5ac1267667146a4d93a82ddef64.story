'Honoured': City executive Rona Fairhead will be the first permanent female chairman of the BBC

Ministers will today announce that the BBC is  to have its first permanent female chairman in the Corporation’s history. 

City executive Rona Fairhead has landed the £110,000-a-year job – just three months after David Cameron said he was ‘determined’ to appoint a woman to the role.

Ms Fairhead, a former Financial Times group boss, was embroiled in controversy earlier this year when shareholders of parent company Pearson revolted over her £1.1 million pay-off.

She voluntarily left the company after being passed over for chief executive. It led to 37 per cent of shareholders refusing to endorse the remuneration report.

The 53-year-old, a non-executive director of HSBC Holdings and PepsiCo, and until recently on the board of the Cabinet Office, is the Government’s ‘preferred candidate’ to succeed Lord Patten as BBC Trust chairman.

He announced in May that he would be standing down following heart surgery. The race was then blown open when previous frontrunner Lord Coe said he was pulling out because he did not have the ‘capacity’ to do the job with his other commitments.

Ms Fairhead will appear before the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee later this month for ‘pre-appointment scrutiny’.

Chairman Tory MP John Whittingdale warned earlier this year that Mr Cameron should not try to ‘push through’ the appointment on the grounds of gender,  rather than merit.

But he said last night: ‘Just because she is female does not mean that is the reason she was appointed. She has an excellent CV and wide experience, and I look forward to seeing her in front of the select committee.’

Ms Fairhead – also tipped  to become the new chairman of Barclays – said: ‘The BBC is a great British institution packed with talented people, and I’m honoured to have the opportunity to be chairman of the BBC Trust.

'I’m under no illusions about the significance or enormity of the job but am excited to have the chance to lead the BBC through the coming years.’
