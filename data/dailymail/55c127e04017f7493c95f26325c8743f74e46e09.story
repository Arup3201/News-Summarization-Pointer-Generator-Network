A woman charged for her attack on a vision-impaired bus passenger on the Gold Coast has been spared jail time, despite an appeal from the Attourney- General for a harsher sentence.

Footage of Larna Jane Watmough, 22, and her friend Layni Cameron attacking 77-year-old Paul Buttigieg caused national outrage when it went viral in February 2014.

Former Queensland Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie appealed the two-month suspended sentence handed down to Ms Watmough, saying the punishment was ‘manifestly inadequate’.

Remorseful: Ms Watmough is lucky to have avoided a jail sentence after former Attorney-General, Jarrod Bleijie, appealed for a harsher penalty 

Judge Paul Smith agreed the sentence was inadequate given the vicious and unprovoked nature of the crime. 

Ms Watmough’s case was reviewed and although her sentence was tripled to six months, it remains wholly suspended.

This means Ms Watmough has been spared jail time for the second time, with Judge Smith attributing this to her genuine remorse, limited criminal history, employment and rehabilitation.

Ms Watmough has also reportedly stopped taking drugs. 

‘I note that (Watmough) has been employed since the sentence; continues to report to the probation office; has paid the compensation ordered; and continues to see a psychologist,’ Judge Smith outlined in a written decision on Monday.

The new six-month suspended sentence started in September 2014 and will expire in a fortnight.  

Ms Watmough penned a remorseful letter to Mr Buttigieg detailing her involvement with the elderly community and apologising for her actions.

The 21-year-old presented a handwritten note to the court apologising to the man for the incident in February when footage went viral of Watmough and friend Layni Cameron attacking Paul Buttigieg on a bus in the suburb of Kirra

Despite showing 'genuine remorse' Ms Watmough has been the target for death and rape threats

Judge Smith says Ms Watmough has been subject to extensive public scrutiny after the attack which has negatively affected her mental health.

‘I note there have been death and rape threats against her. She has been depressed as a result of this."

The incident occurred after the two young women attended a racing event earlier in the day before catching the bus home from the Tweed Heads Bowls Club.

Watmough's co-accused, Cameron, 18, received a three year sentence for her role in the attack. She was out on bail at the time of the attack for robbing a Surfers Paradise store with a knife. 

Mobile phone footage shot by another passenger showed the two women punching, kicking and spitting at an elderly man while hurling insults
