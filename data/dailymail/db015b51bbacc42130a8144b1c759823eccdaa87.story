Smiling, dressed in white and clutching a bridal bouquet, Colleen Hufford is a picture of happiness standing next to KC Hufford, her new husband.

Little did they, or anybody else, know how the new union, solemnized in Great Falls, Montana, in 1984, would be brought to an abrupt and savage end.

Mrs Hufford, 54, died on the afternoon of September 25, her head hacked from her body in the food production plant where she worked in Moore, Oklahoma.

Happy: Colleen Hufford is pictured at her wedding to KC Hufford. The ceremony was held at Great Falls, Montana, in 1984

Victim: Mr and Mrs Hufford are pictured more recently in a photograph released today by their family. Mrs Hufford was working at Vaughan Foods production plant in Moore, Oklahoma, when she was beheaded

Alton Nolen, 30, has been charged with her murder.

Reports describe how Nolen, a committed Muslim who had previously tried to convert his colleagues, was fired after an argument Islamic theology got out of hand.

But he returned to his workplace - Vaughan Foods - the same day with a knife and attacked two of his colleagues.

He approached Mrs Hufford from behind and severed her head, according to a police affidavit, then turned on her colleague, 43-year-old Traci Johnson.

Charged: Alton Nolen, 30, who worked with Mrs Hufford, has been charged with her murder. Prosecutors will seek the death penalty if he is convicted

Johnson was stabbed several times, and had to be sent to hospital, but survived the attack and is now recovering.

Nolen's rampage only came to an end when he was shot by Vaughan Foods CEO Mark Vaughan.

Vaughan, a sheriff's deputy, used a rifle to stop Nolen, who was taken to hospital then arrested and charged after he woke up.

Prosecutors in Oklahoma have said that if Nolen is found guilty of murder they will seek the death penalty.

Brutal: Mrs Hufford was one of two victims in the violent attack. The other, Traci Johnson, 43, was stabbed and hospitalized - but was not killed

A funeral for Mrs Hufford was held at a Baptist church in Moore last week. Around 450 mourners attended the service, which was closed to the media.

In an official statement issued two days before the funeral, her family mourned their loss and deplored the violence which led to her death.

It said: 'Losing our mom, wife and grandmother has been one of the most difficult challenges any of us have faced in our lives'.

'For her life to have been taken in such a tragic act of violence adds a depth of grief we are trying to comprehend.'
