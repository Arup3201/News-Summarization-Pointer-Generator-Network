Two members of the punk group Pussy Riot have been detained while walking in the Winter Olympics host city of Sochi.

Nadezhda Tolokonnikova wrote on Twitter that she and Maria Alekhina were stopped and accused of a crime. She said a third member of the loosely organised group was also detained.

Local activist Seymon Simonov said the two Pussy Riot members were accused of theft and nine people were held in all.

Ms Tolokonnikova said authorities used
 'force' during the detention on Tuesday near the ferry terminal area 
where booths celebrating the Olympics have been set up.

The area is 
about 20 miles north of the seaside Olympic venues.

'At
 the moment of detention, we were not conducting any actions, we were 
walking in Sochi,' Ms Tolokonnikova wrote on Twitter while being held by
 police. 'We are in Sochi with the goal of staging a Pussy Riot protest.
 The song is called 'Putin will teach you to love the motherland'.'

Ms Tolokonnikova also said they had been detained for about 10 hours on Sunday.

The
 women were being held on Tuesday at a police station in Adler, a suburb
 of Sochi that is home to the Olympic Park. No charges have been filed.

Ms
 Alekhina and Ms Tolokonnikova spent nearly two years in prison but were
 released in December. They were convicted of hooliganism after staging a
 protest in Moscow's largest cathedral in opposition to President 
Vladimir Putin's government.

Pussy
 Riot have become an international flashpoint for those who contend the 
Putin government has exceeded its authority in dealing with an array of 
issues, notably human and gay rights.

Ms Alekhina and Ms Tolokonnikova recently visited the US and Germany to take part in an Amnesty International concert.

The
 women said their protest performance at the cathedral was aimed at 
raising concern about the close ties between the church and state.

Russia
 has put severe limitations on protests in Sochi during the Olympics, 
ordering that any demonstration must get advance approval and be held 
only in the neighbourhood of Khosta, an area between Adler and central 
Sochi that is unlikely to be visited by outsiders.

Amnesty International immediately called on the Russian authorities to release a total of nine activists- including Ms Alekhina and Ms Tolokonnikova - who have been arrested in Sochi.

Amnesty International Europe and Central Asia Director John Dalhuisen said: 'In Putinâ€™s Russia, the authorities have turned the Olympic rings - a worldwide symbol of hope and striving for the best of the human spirit - into handcuffs to shackle freedom of expression.

'This is outrageous. There are reports of arrests of activists in Sochi and the Olympic Games area almost daily. The International Olympic Committee must roundly condemn these and all arrests of activists near Sochi.

'People are being targeted merely for peacefully speaking their minds. The Russian authorities must end this downward spiral of human rights violations around the Olympic Village.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
