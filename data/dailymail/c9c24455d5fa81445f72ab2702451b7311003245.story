A footballer who 'died' in his sleep when his heart stopped for 25 minutes has made a miraculous recovery, making it back on to the pitch. 

Louie Shields, 23, from Blackpool, suffered a cardiac arrest when he was in bed.

His mother Karen McAuley, 51, was forced to give her son CPR, desperately battling to save her son's life as his girlfriend Kirsten Jones, 21, dialled 999.

He was rushed to Blackpool's Victoria Hospital where doctors said he had been clinically dead for 25 minutes before he was put on a life support machine. 

Louie Shields, 23 suffered a cardiac arrest - which means his heart stopped - in his sleep. His terrified girlfriend Kirsten Jones, 21, immediately dialled 999 so he was rushed to hospital

Mr Shields' heart stopped for 25 minutes. He was put on a life support machine and went into an induced coma for four days

Mr Shields, who plays for Poulton FC and works in a gym, spent four days in an induced coma before being released from hospital three weeks later. 

Now he is back playing football and spends his spare time raising money for charity and speaking to young people about how to spot the signs of a cardiac arrest.

He said: 'I don't have any memory of what actually happened - it's all a complete blur to me.

'I had a fit at about two in the morning and my girlfriend woke up as I started shaking.

'She raced downstairs to get my mum who came up to my room and had to give me CPR while Kirsten called for an ambulance.

'My whole body had turned blue and no matter how hard my mum tried she couldn't resuscitate me.

'Paramedics were giving me CPR in the ambulance on the way to the hospital and by the time I arrive I had been dead for nearly half an hour.

'It's incredible that I'm alive - my mum, girlfriend and paramedics were incredible.'

A cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system, caused by an abnormal rhythm. 

Contrary to popular belief, a cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack.

A cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system.

It is caused by an abnormal rhythm, or arrhythmia.

Anyone can suffer a cardiac arrest and it can happen at any time and without warning.

Symptoms include unresponsiveness, loss of consciousness, lack of pulse and stopping breathing.

In contrast, a heart attack can be thought of as a problem with the heart's plumbing - it occurs when an artery supplying the heart becomes blocked.

This causes the heart muscle to begin to die slowly while the patient usually remains awake and alert.

In the hospital, Mr Shields' petrified relatives were asked by doctors if he had taken any drugs before the fit as they were unable to find the cause of the problem.

But doctors later discovered that Mr Shields was born with an extra pathway between the upper and lower chambers of his heart.

He said: 'They we're struggling to find out why I had the fit but they eventually found out it was something I was born with.

'Doctors had to ask my mum if I had been drinking or if I had taken any drugs that could have made me ill.

'But they apologised to my mum when they knew the condition was something I was born with.

'I'm just glad to have survived the whole thing and be able to be with my family and friends again.

'I definitely appreciate things a lot more now.

'I feel incredibly lucky to be alive, let alone to be back in work and playing football again.'

Former Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest during an F.A. Cup tie against Tottenham in March 2012.

The 26-year-old received lengthy treatment on the pitch before being rushed to hospital as the match was abandoned by referee Howard Webb.

Doctors said his heart had stopped for 78 minutes but he survived after months of hospital treatment.

He announced his retirement from professional football in August 2012 after taking advice from medics.

Mr Shields returned to the pitch five months after his cardiac arrest and now speaks to young people about the importance of good health and spotting the signs of a cardiac arrest.

He has also raised £4,000 for the Lancashire Cardiac Centre by hosting a black tie ball in Blackpool.

Kathy Ancell, head of fundraising at Blue Skies Hospitals Fund, said: 'We are delighted to hear that Louie has recovered so well.

'We are extremely grateful to him for organising a black tie event to support the Heart of Gold Charitable Fund.

'It is great that he wants to support the charity in lieu of the excellent treatment he received and funds raised will benefit future patients.

'Charitable funds allow the cardiac centre to enhance patient care above and beyond what can be provided from core NHS funds, for the benefit of patients from across Lancashire and South Cumbria.'

Mr Shields said: 'It was a good night and I think it went very well. It was really important for me and my family to be able to say thank you.

'It means a lot after everything the people at the Lancashire Cardiac Centre did for me - I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for them. I really wanted to be able to give something back.'
