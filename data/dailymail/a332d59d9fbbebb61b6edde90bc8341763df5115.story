Hawks midfielder Jordan Lewis said that if fans were planning to boo former player Lance  Franklin, they should think again, according to the ABC.

Franklin, a dual premiership star at Hawthorn, quit the club last year to join the Sydney Swans and will now face off against his former team mates on Saturday.

'I'm against that side of the game,' Lewis said at Hawthorn's training session.

Hawks player Cyril Rioli, who may be recalled from injury to play in Saturday's grand final, was a crowd favorite

'Everyone who comes to the game has their own intentions. We can't stop it. We're not in a position to stop it.

'But you would think a guy who has given us nine years of good service, you'd think there'd be some sort of respect there and not boo him the way we've heard they're going to boo him.

'But I think that spurs him on, he loves the big occasion. He loves proving people wrong and if we go along that path, we might poke the bear.'

Lewis was drafted to Hawthorn in 2004 alongside Franklin and key forward Jarryd Roughead.

They all made their senior debutes the following year.

Since joining Sydney, Franklin won the Coleman Medal and finished joint runner-up in the Brownlow Medal Count. 

Roughead said it had been quiet when he was asked if he'd heard from Franklin this week. 

'They fly out today. I daresay we'll see him tomorrow,' he said.

'We've got the parade and we can say g'day then.'
