A California father was arrested Friday night by deputies - after allegedly hosting an alcohol-fueled, Playboy Mansion-themed birthday party for his 18-year-old daughter.

Birthday girl Olivia Lake's 'Liv's Playboy Mansion' shindig was attended by between 150 and 200 teenagers at her family's home in Poway, said San Diego County Sheriff's deputies.

Female party guests sported bunny ears when they posed for racy group snaps to celebrate, Instagram images reveal.

Sgt. Angela Pearl told 10News that deputies arrested the birthday girl's father Jeff Lake for social host ordinance violation charges. 

Teens with alcoholic beverages in their hands were observed by deputies outside the Lake family's home - and another two underage teens were unconscious inside, according to the news outlet.

'That [social host] ordinance makes it illegal to host a party where underage individuals consume alcohol. It comes with a possible 6-month jail sentence,' the news outlet explained.  

Jeff Lake did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online.

Mayor Steve Vaus slammed the events, telling 10News 'You have a party like this and it's as though you're handing out hand grenades as party favors. It's a disaster waiting to happen.'

He also said 'I'd like to put a scarlet letter in front of the homes of people that do this, to say you can't trust these folks, they make bad decisions related to kids' safety.'

Jeff Lake works as a lawyer with a medical marijuana focus, and his wife Jacki Lake used to be the parent-teacher association president at the local high school, 10News reported.

Adults besides Olivia Lake's father attended the birthday bash though it is not clear if the girl's mother was also there, according to the television station.

Jacki Lake previously called her daughter 'the baddest b**** in town' in a birthday tweet and in the same message told her 'Now don't get arrested,' 10News pointed out.

18-year-old Olivia Lake's Twitter account is protected, though the station obtained a message she wrote to her followers.

It said, 'Huge thanks to everyone who was able to be a part of last night! I hope you all had a damn good time and that you're all okay and safe.'
