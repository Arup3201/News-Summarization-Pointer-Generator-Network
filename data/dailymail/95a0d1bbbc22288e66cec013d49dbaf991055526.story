The economy will surpass its pre-recession peak within months as growth returns to its fastest pace since 2007, economists said yesterday.

Analysts have forecasted growth of up to 3 per cent this year – as the latest GDP figures show national wealth rose by 1.9 per cent in 2013.

Chancellor George Osborne yesterday welcomed the latest boost to the British economy but warned: ‘I am the first to say the job isn’t done.’

The Office for National Statistics said the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the final three months of last year, having expanded by 0.8 per cent in the previous quarter.

Its report showed that 2013 was the first time since 2007 that output rose in every quarter of the year, with total growth of 1.9 per cent over 12 months.

The powerhouse services sector, which makes up 77.8 per cent of the economy and ranges from hotels and restaurants to stockbrokers and accountants, grew by 0.8 per cent between October and December.

Manufacturing performed best of all – rising by 0.9 per cent in the last quarter.

Construction fell 0.3 per cent in the same period, despite the recent recovery in the housing market, but was up 4.5 per cent on the year.

Overall, Britain is now the fastest growing major economy in Europe. But the economy is still 1.3 per cent below its pre-recession peak, having crashed by 7.2 per cent in 2008 and 2009 under Labour.

However, experts say the economy will claw back the rest of the lost ground in the first half of this year – bringing the longest downturn for more than a century to an end.

But Mr Osborne mocked Mr Balls' predictions of a million more jobless and no economic growth without rising borrowing and spending

David Tinsley, an analyst at BNP Paribas, said: ‘The economy can finally surpass the pre-crisis level of output in the second quarter of the year.’

And Rob Wood, a former Bank of England economist now at Berenberg Bank, predicted growth of 3 per cent this year and 3.3 per cent in 2015.

He said: ‘Last year saw the strongest UK growth since 2007, and 2014 should see an even better result. The recovery will snowball.’

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls yesterday welcomed the growth figures after ‘three damaging years of flatlining’ but said: ‘This is not yet the strong and balanced recovery we need.’

He added: ‘For working people facing a cost-of-living crisis this is still no recovery at all.’

But Mr Osborne mocked Mr Balls’ predictions of a million more jobless and no economic growth without rising borrowing and spending.

‘He has been wrong about all of those things. What they need on the other side of the House is new crystal Balls,’ he told MPs.

‘Ultimately you can’t improve the living standards of the country if you don’t improve the economy of a country, and that’s what is happening at the moment: the economy is growing and jobs are being created.’

The Chancellor also insisted that Labour would pose a serious risk to the recovery, adding: ‘The truth is that by being anti-business, they are anti-recovery, anti-jobs, anti-investment, anti the British people.’ 

The International Monetary Fund last week raised its UK growth forecast for 2014 to 2.4 per cent, while official figures show unemployment falling at its fastest pace since 1997.

Joe Grice, chief economic adviser at the ONS, said four successive quarters of significant growth showed the economy was improving consistently. 

And John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘These growth figures confirm what we’ve been hearing for some time. Businesses across Britain are growing ever more bullish about their prospects.’

But he added: ‘We mustn’t pat ourselves on the back for a recovery that is merely good, when what we need is a recovery that is truly great.’
