A grandmother who bought a crumbling 17th Century house for just £300 in 1968 has finally put it on the market after spending 46 years painstakingly restoring it back to its former glory.

Gillian Holland, 71, bought the abandoned black-and-white timber-framed home in Bewdley, Worcester, at a knockdown price after discovering it was about to be demolished.

She and her late husband Terry spent almost half a century lovingly restoring Bridge View - which was built in 1623 - and she has now finally put it on the market with an asking price of £200,000.

Ms Holland (pictured today) said she has spent £20,000 transforming the property, which she will now sell

Despite spending most weekends and holidays scouring skips and breakers yards for beams and fixtures to use in the house, she has never spent a night in the property.

Ms Holland, a retired library clerk, lived in a house three doors down from the ruined house, and now hopes it will be bought by a family.

She has spent an estimated £20,000 doing the work and finally completed it earlier this summer.

The grandmother-of-three said: 'No-one wanted the property as it was about to have a demolition order slapped on it by the Bewdley borough surveyors. It was in a really bad state.

'We live very close by and we just fell in love with the house.

'We didn't want it to be knocked down so just went for it when we realised no-one else was going to step in and buy it.

'It was lethal. We bought it purely out of self-interest. Nobody else would have been stupid enough to buy it.

'We took the building to the ground ourselves. It was daunting because we did not have a lot of money.

The house, named Bridge View, was built in 1623 and had been set for demolition when bought by Ms Holland

Despite spending decades restoring the house, Ms Holland has never spent a night in the property and instead lives in a house on the same road. She said she took on the project with her late husband out of 'self-interest'

'We had no idea how much property restoration cost - it must be around £20,000.

'We put scaffolding up ourselves and over the pavement, which would not be allowed today.

'We took it down and marked up all the timbers and detailed where they had come from.

'In 1967, the Civic Amenities Act was introduced and this awarded town scheme grants. This was crucial for us.

'Bewdley was the first conservation town in Worcestershire, and Bridge View was the first property awarded a grant of about £3,000.

'That gave us hope. The county conservation team were very supportive. We were in the position then to employ a knowledgeable student architect.'

The couple, who had three children, split up in the early 1990s and Mr Holland died in his sixties several years ago - but she continued to restore the building.

She added: 'We kept running out of money and we were poor most of our lives.

'We had lots of help from skilled local craftsmen. For instance, we learned how to lay the traditional local tiles.

'Most modern tiles are nailed on, but if you drill old tiles they split and are lain on traditional lime mortar.

'We even went through skips. We found timbers, pieces of sandstone, Jacobean panelling and piles of things we needed.

'It is a bit of a wrench to sell it, considering I have never even spent one night in the property but I'm immensely proud of what we did.

Ms Holland said: 'We bought it purely out of self-interest. Nobody else would have been stupid enough to buy it'

The property was completed earlier this summer and has been put on the market this week for £200,000

Ms Holland said she hopes a family will buy the property and said restoring it has been a 'remarkable journey'

The house was originally a general store selling pewter, iron supplies and food to people living in Bewdley

'The two estate agents who have looked at the property have both valued it at about £200,000 but said it was difficult to value.

'They noted that is in the flood plain and is vulnerable to flooding, there is no garden and it is on the main road. It is not madly attractive.

'But I have got to sell it now. All my savings are tied up in it. I probably need to go to a care home soon so I need to move out. I cannot care for the building anymore.

'Having spent most of my life rebuilding it, I am not going to just sell it to someone who thinks it is quaint.

'I am not walking around saying "I am proud of this and that". It was just really interesting to do.

'It enabled me to do, in that day in the 1960s, a lot of things women were unable to do. It has been an education.

'It was fun. It is like some people spend time on rebuilding classic cars. Money was not relevant, it was a remarkable journey.'

The house was originally a general store selling pewter, iron supplies and food to people crossing the medieval bridge into Bewdley.

It was then turned into a pub before finally being converted into a private house when it fell into a state of disrepair at the beginning of the 20th century.

Ms Holland said: 'I have never even spent one night in the property but I'm immensely proud of what we did'

She said estate agents have found it difficult to value the property because it is situated on a flood plain and there is lack of a garden (above). It is also on a main road. The grandmother added: 'It is not madly attractive'

Ms Holland said: 'There were lots of reasons why the renovation project took so long to complete but mainly because it was the money.

'We had three children to bring up and jobs to do and we also didn't want to rush into renovating the house. We wanted to take the time to do it right.

'We spent a long time tracking down the exact materials we needed. For example, it took us a long time to track down the correct bullnose bricks for the wall which were unique to Bewdley.

'Before the children were born myself and Terry spent hours driving around Bewdley in a Land Rover scouring scrap yards and building merchants.

'At that time people didn't value historic buildings so usually they would strip out the original features of a house, the tiles and panelling and just dump it all.

'We got quite skilled at finding out where demolitions were taking place and negotiated with the people who were taking the properties apart.

'Because we were doing most of the work ourselves, we got a lot of things wrong.

'On one occasion we bought a large section of sandstone wall for the foundations but didn't realise that turns back to sand when it goes in the ground.

'We both wanted the house to be renovated properly because otherwise there would have been no point doing it in the first place.'
