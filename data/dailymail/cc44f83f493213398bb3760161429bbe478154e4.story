With the average cost of a wedding hitting £25,000, thrifty brides are always on the hunt for ways to budget when it comes to planning the big day.

And now, George at Asda is hoping to help - by launching a wedding collection for bridesmaids and pageboys starting from just £7.

Dubbed 'the most affordable range anywhere on the high street', the supermarket claim that it's half the price of rivals such as Debenhams and Next and is a 'saviour for cash-strapped brides-to-be'. 

George at Asda has launched a Wedding Collection of bridesmaid and pageboy outfits starting from £7

The new range is designed for children aged 9 months up to 14 years, with girls' bridesmaid and flowergirl dresses start at £12, boys' formal shirts at £7 and suit trousers at £10. 

A complete outfit for a flowergirl will cost from £28, whilst pageboys can look sharp in a shirt, tie, waistcoat, suit and  shoes for £51. 

Girls' bridesmaid and flowergirl dresses start at £12 and there will be 14 options in total 

Pageboys can be kitted out in a shirt, tie, waistcoat, suit and shoes for £51 form the supermarket's new range

The new launch comes on the back of research by the store revealing that the average number of bridesmaids at a UK wedding is now four, with two-thirds of brides coughing up in excess of £500 to kit out bridesmaids, flowergirls and pageboys.

Kate Moss sparked the 'more is more' trend with 14 flowergirls and two page boys at her wedding to Jamie Hince in 2011.

But Poppy Delevingne went one (or rather, three) better with an impressive 17 bridesmaids and two pageboys when she said 'I Do' in May last year. To kit out Poppy's entourage in the new collection from Asda would come in at £578.

Asda decided to venture into bridesmaid and pageboy outfits after research revealed that two-thirds of brides cough up in excess of £500 to kit out their entourage 

The Duchess of Cambridge's  flowergirls were kitted out in Nicki Macfarlane designs and with prices starting at a minimum of £210 per frock, Asda say the royal flowergirls' dresses were 90 per cent more expensive than  the highest priced dress  at George, which would set you back £20.  

A spokesperson for the supermarket said: 'George was the first supermarket retailer to offer wedding clothing for adults in 2008 and it was a huge success. 

'We want brides and grooms to have a perfect day to remember that doesn't break the bank, and now they can have as many supporting cast as they need!'.
