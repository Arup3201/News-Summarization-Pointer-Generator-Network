Danish heartthrob Nikolaj Coster-Waldau was in for a surprise when staff at Alcázar Palace denied him entry to the gorgeous tourist attraction in Seville, Spain.

Mr Coster-Waldau - who plays Jaime Lannister in the Game of Thrones - was forced to fork out the €9.50 (£7.50) entrance fee when staff at the attraction didn't recognise who he was.

The star was filming scenes for season five of the fantasy TV drama when he was barred from entering the grounds of the palace.

Game of Thrones is certain to attract more tourists to the region as previous shoot locations Dubrovnik, Malta, Morocco and  Northern Island have reportedly seen a boost in their economy.

According to reports, Seville draws approximately two million visitors a year although the filming may cause some inconvenience to holiday-makers.

But mayor of Seville Juan Ignacio Zoido explained to Inquisitr.com it will all be worth it.

'We will have to endure some inconvenience, taking into account the possible generation of jobs and the impact on tourism that this will have.'
