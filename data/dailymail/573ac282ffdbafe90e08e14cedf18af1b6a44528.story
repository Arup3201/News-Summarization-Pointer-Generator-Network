Investigators say the metal security door detached and fell on a three-year-old girl who died

Alison
 Brady, who lives across the street and saw the gate fall, told The 
Philadelphia Inquirer that stucco work had recently been done on the 
shop.

'It was almost 
like slow motion,' she told the newspaper. 'The gate was falling and 
people were screaming and it hit the ground and the little girl was 
there.'

'Our hearts and 
prayers go out to the child's family,' said Linda Duke, a spokeswoman 
for Rita's Italian Ice, the shop's parent company.

'Due to the current investigation we really cannot comment about the unfortunate incident.'

 from the scene show the black metal gate lying on the sidewalk, pink 
balloons still tied to it in front of the shop's red and white striped 
awning.

Several popped balloons appear trapped underneath the gate, which businesses typically roll down after hour to prevent crime.

Officials with the Department of Licenses and Inspections were investigating.

The department told WCAU that there were no open violations at the store and no reported problems with the gate.

L&I said that they only inspect security gates if they receive a complaint.
