A Chinese man had to be rescued after workers inspecting power lines found him trapped in an underground pipe.

Power plant employees were stunned when they spotted the man's face peering through a small opening in the ground in the city of Sishi in Fujian province.

According to rescuers the man kept referring to himself as the Monkey King - a reference to classic Chinese literature - during the rescue.

Monkey King: Fire crews had to rescue a man from an underground pipe in Shishi in China after he became trapped. He was only found when workers checking underground cables spotted his face through a hole in the ground

The man was discovered in the pipe by employees from a local power company who were checking underground cables.

Unable to free the man themselves, the team called emergency services for help.

When firefighters arrived they had to dig the pipe out of the ground before breaking it open and pulling the man to safety.

It is not known why the man had crawled into the pipe or how long he was there for.

During the rescue, the man kept telling firefighters that he is Sun Wukong, or the Monkey King, the lead character in one of the four great classical novels of Chinese literature, Journey To The West.

The book, published anonymously in the 1590s, is thought to have been written by Wu Chengen.

In the novel, monkey is born from a stone and acquires spiritual powers through practising Taoism.

After
rebelling against heaven and being imprisoned under a mountain by the 
Buddha, he accompanies the monk Xuanzang on a journey to retrieve the 
Buddhist sutras from India.

Rescued: Fire crews had to dig out the pipe and then break it open in order to rescue the trapped man

The book inspired a 1970s Japanese children's television series Monkey Magic which became a badly-dubbed cult classic in the UK.

It featured memorable fight scenes in which Monkey used a magic staff that could grow in size.

He could also fly on a cloud.

The television series never came to a final resolution, but the book ends when Monkey learns to use his ego selflessly.

The book also inspired an opera, a collaboration between Blur and Gorillaz front man Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett which was launched in London a year after its Manchester opening.Â

Magic: The series became a cult classic among youngsters in the UK in the 1970s

New version: Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett's opera version of the chinese novel, called Monkey: A Journey To The West

Hewlett also designed the characters that fronted the BBC coverage of the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and were based on the novel.

The trapped Chinese man is not the first to be rescued by emergency services in bizarre circumstances in the country this year.

Jian Tsui became trapped between two properties and unable to move after trying to take a shortcut home from the pub.

Trapped so tightly between the buildings, Mr Jian couldn't even breathe in enough to call for help and was not rescued until the following morning when he was spotted during rush hour.
