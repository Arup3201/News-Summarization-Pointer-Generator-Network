TV bosses have been accused of cashing in on the death of Oscar Pistorius's girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp after broadcasting her final appearance on a reality show. 

The backlash came after Tropika Island of Treasure was screened on Saturday night, just three days after the 29-year-old was shot four times at Blade Runner's luxury home.

It was reported that in the aftermath of her shocking Valentine's Day death, the television network was charging news outlets up to $3,000 for short clips of the show.

Producers argued its broadcast was a 'fitting tribute' to  the law graduate, but they have been accused of 
insensitivity for showing her post-eviction interview, where she 
discusses her 'journey in life' and the 'way you go out.'

Reeva was excited to be part of the challenge, and had planned many more projects for her future

They have also angered women's rights
groups in South Africa who have called for the proceeds from the pre-recorded show to be donated to charity.

'If this programme is to be aired it 
should help the cause of women and children suffering from violence,' 
Stubbs Maluleke, from South Africa's Sonke Gender Justice Network told The Independent.

In Tropika Island of Treasure, Miss 
Steenkamp competes alongside seven South African celebrities and seven 
other contestants to win a prize of one million rand prize (£72,500).

They have to complete a series of challenges, including diving off 75-foot cliffs into the ocean, tug of wars, and races.

In one clip, Miss Steenkamp
is seen leaning against a palm tree on the show’s set in Jamaica, 
blowing kisses towards the camera, declaring: 'I’m going to miss you all
so much. I love you very, very much.'

Miss Steenkamp described herself as 'Brainy, blonde, bombshell' on the show, and said she had 'amazing memories' of her time on the programme

Reeva was filmed in high spirits and enjoying herself on the programme, which saw her swim with dolphins

At another point, she says: 'I think 
that the way you go out, not just your journey in life but the way that 
you go out and you make your exit is so important.'

Decision: Executive producer Samantha Moon argued the decision to air the programme had nothing to do with ratings

Executive producer Samantha Moon argued the decision to air the programme had nothing to do with ratings.

She
told the BBC's Newshour: 'I took it after consultation with her family 
and the feeling was that this is an amazing woman who you don't have 
very much in the public domain except for the work she was most well 
known for... which is her modelling work.

'We
felt that it was important for people to know that there was more to 
the narrative of Reeva than an exceptionally beautiful girl in a bikini,
that she was strong and vibrant and funny and lovely and that this is a
tragedy on an unspeakable level.'

But Mrs Moon charged news outlets $3,000 each to broadcast a short clip from the
television show, according to the Independent. 

The show was broadcast on state 
television channel SABC1 at the weekend, although there have been conflicting reports about whether Miss Steenkamp’s family were consulted about airing the programme. 

Some of her family told Associated 
Press on Saturday that they had not been contacted by either the SABC or
the show’s producers.

'Yesterday the mother agreed that we 
should go ahead and we are free to go ahead and we are working on how to
pay tribute to her' said Kaizer Kganyagon, a spokesman for SABC.

Miss Steenkamp’s cousin Sharon Steenkamp said 
the family did not oppose the airing, saying: 'Her last words to us 
personally was that she wants us to watch it.'

Rachel Jewkes, a gender and health 
researcher at the South African Medical Research Council, told the 
The Express that the clips of Miss Steenkamp discussing her 'exit' were particularly insensitive

She
said: 'There was a big question about whether it should have been shown
at all, or whether they were trying to get audience ratings off the 
fact she had died.

The programme's website previously 
issued a message saying: 'We are deeply saddened and extend our 
condolences to Reeva's family and friends.'

Tropika Island of Treasure host DJ 
Fresh defended the choice on Twitter writing: 'An entire season of a 
game show will never be canceled coz 1 contestant ‘left us’. HOW TV 
WORKS.'

He said that 
there was nothing 'evil or sinister' about the decision, saying 'So 
whats next, dont sell music after an artist is dead coz morally 
indefensible?'

South African TV critic, Thinus 
Ferreira, told the BBC that the motives were questionable and 'very much
about the commercial considerations.'

In the show, Reeva said she had a passion for cooking and loves spending quality time with her friends and family

Reeva, pictured in advertising shots for the 
Tropika Island of Treasure show, had Tweeted excitedly about appearing 
on the reality programme

On the show which will be broadcast today, Reeva said she liked reading books on her days off

He said that if the show had been pulled it would have upset sponsors, advertising and scheduling.

The show, set in Jamaica, asks 
contestants to describe themselves in three words and Miss Steenkamp 
said: 'Brainy, blonde, bombshell'.

Miss
Steenkamp had taken to her Twitter account to excitedly write about her
part in the show, asking followers to help her decide what to wear for 
her publicity events.

On
the website, it describes how Reeva was born in Cape Town and moved to 
Port Elizabeth as a child where she continued her studies after 
matriculating, eventually graduating with a degree in law.

It
says: 'She moved to Johannesburg 6 years ago after being scouted and 
named the first face of cosmetics giant Avon South Africa.

Message: The programme's website previously issued a message saying: 'We are deeply saddened and extend our condolences to Reeva's family and friends'

'Since then, Reeva has travelled between JHB and Cape Town to film and shoot some of SA’s leading campaigns and commercials.

'Toyota, FHM, Clover and Italian brand Zui are some of the more prestigious clients she has worked for.

'With
a background in TV presenting, once the live roaming presenter for 
FashionTV in South Africa, Reeva is currently working on some major 
projects that include smaller TV roles as well as a lead in a new 
reality TV show.

'Reeva has a passion for cars and 
cooking and prefers to read a book on her off days and spend quality 
time with friends and family.'

Backlash: Criticism came after Miss Steenkamp's final appearance on Tropika Island of Treasure, was screened on Saturday night, just three days after the 29-year-old was shot four times at Pistorius¿s luxury home

Miss
Steenkamp, 29, was shot four times early on Thursday at Pistorius’s 
luxury home in a secure housing estate on the outskirts of Pretoria.

Police
have rubbished speculation that Pistorius – who is known to have kept a
pistol by his bed and a machine gun at his bedroom window – may have 
mistaken his girlfriend of three months for an intruder.

Her violent death has devastated her family and friends, and stunned the rest of the world.

Miss
Steenkamp will be buried tomorrow  - the same day Pistorius appears 
before Pretoria chief magistrate Desmond Nair for the start of what is 
expected to be a two day long bail application after being charged with 
murder.

It was 
reported today that police are investigating if Oscar Pistorius may have
shot dead his girlfriend in a fit of so-called 'steroid rage' - an 
explosion of aggression caused by performance-boosting steroids.

This morning the South African Police Service refused to respond to the claim, but sources close to investigation had previously told a local paper that the steroid rage was one line of enquiry and that the star's blood was being tested for drugs.

South African police believe Pistorius may have beaten his girlfriend with a cricket bat before shooting her.

Yesterday it emerged that detectives are reported to have recovered a bloodied bat from the Paralympic champion’s bedroom and to have established that model Reeva Steenkamp’s skull had been ‘crushed’.

This and other evidence – a smashed bathroom door, a 9mm pistol, the peculiar pattern of wounds on the body and reports of a row earlier in the evening – is said to have led them to believe the murder case against the sprinter is ‘rock solid’.
