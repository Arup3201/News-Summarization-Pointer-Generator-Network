If grey skies and rain ruined your fun over the Easter break, the next few days could make up for it.

This Bank Holiday weekend, forecasters are predicting dry and fine weather for many.

Temperatures as high as 20C are expected in south-eastern England on Monday.

But across the UK, tomorrow is the best bet for catching rays. After a potentially frosty night, temperatures will reach the mid-teens in the West and South West, while it will be cooler in the East with cloud and some rain in the North and Scotland.

The South will see warm weather into Monday, when it will bask in temperatures near 18C.

In inland parts of the South East, the mercury is set to reach 20C, with breezes cooling coastal areas.

Eddy Carroll, of the Met Office, said: ‘It looks as though much of the UK will enjoy some pleasant spring weather this weekend.

‘Although the nights and mornings will be chilly, it should feel pleasantly warm in the daytime sunshine.

‘The best of that warm sunshine is likely across central and southern parts of England.

‘Northern parts of UK look set to have some rather changeable conditions, but even here there will be some brighter and drier spells, especially in the east.’

Leon Brown, of The Weather Channel, added: ‘Through to Bank Holiday Monday, central and southern Britain will be dry and fine with plenty of sunshine under high pressure.

‘Beware a widespread ground frost and some air frosts on Saturday morning.’

‘Gradually, though, it will become warmer, with afternoon temperatures of 15C to 17C by Sunday and 18C to 19C by Monday in central and western areas.’

James Berresford, Chief Executive of VisitEngland said: ‘The fine weather forecast for this weekend will hopefully entice those with a spirit of adventure to get out exploring on a day trip or short break in England this May Bank Holiday.’

Yesterday Tallulah Ferguson, three, enjoyed a sunny spot among the stunning bluebells which have flowered in St Loy, Cornwall.

The plant’s blooms often mark the start of summer, and are particularly associated with ancient woodland where they can produce carpets of vibrant colour.
