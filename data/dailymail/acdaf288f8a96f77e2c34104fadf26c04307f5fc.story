An 18-year-old has been arrested in connection with Christmas cyber attacks on Playstation and Xbox networks following a joint investigation between the FBI and British police. 

The 'quiet' teenager, named locally as Jordan Lee-Bevan, was arrested during a raid at his semi-detached home in Southport, Merseyside, today, with officers seizing computers as he was taken away in a police car.

It comes after thousands were refused access to Sony and Microsoft servers over the Christmas period.

 The cyber-attack, thought to have been created by hacker group Lizard Squad, shut down some services for five days. 

Scores of gamers were left unable to play Christmas gifts or interact online as a result of the disruption.

While it is unclear whether today's arrest is in direct connection with the Christmas day attack, investigating authorities said it was 'significant' in the pursuit of cyber crime. 

The teenager, described by neighbours as 'quiet', is suspected of unauthorised access with intent to commit further offences and threats to kill.  

He is also suspected of 'swatting', a cyber activity which involves making hoax calls via Skype. In this case he is thought to have targeted US law enforcement agencies, and is also suspected of threatening to kill.

The latest arrested follows that of Vincent Omari, 22, from Twickenham, south-west London, who has been linked to the lizard squad and was detained shortly after the cyber attack.

 He was questioned on suspicion of fraud by false representation and Computer Misuse Act offences before being bailed to March 10.

 Omari, who is a student of network security and ethical hacking, has said he is simply a spokesman for Lizard Squad - and denied having any part in the attack on Sony and Microsoft. 

Craig Jones, Head of the Cyber Crime Unit at South East Regional Organised Crime Unit said: 'We are still at the early stages of the investigation and there is still much work to be done.

Police arrived at the home of the teenager (above) where, neighbours said, they were allowed entry

'We will continue to work closely with the FBI to identify those who commit offences and hold them to account.

'Offences referred to as ‘swatting’ involve law enforcement forces in the United States receiving hoax calls via Skype for a major incident in which Swat teams were dispatched.

DCC Peter Goodman, National Policing Lead for Cyber Security at the Association of Police Officers added the arrest was 'significant' in ongoing investigations. 

''This arrest demonstrates that we will continue to pursue those who commit crime with the false perception they are protected within their own homes or hiding behind anonymous online personas.

'We urge industry, communities and individuals to protect themselves by implementing basic security measures whilst taking full advantage and enjoyment the opportunities the world wide web provides.' 

Neighbours in the quiet residential street expressed their shock at the development which came as a fleet of police cars descended on the area this morning.  

One, who did not wish to be named, said: 'He is very quiet young man. I don't know him very well - he stayed in his bedroom a lot.

'I haven't seen the family yet but I imagine it will be a big shock.

Another added: 'He is very quiet. I'd see him coming in and out of the house but he didn't really say a word.

Lizard Squad is a network of hackers which bears striking similarities to the online anarchist collective Anonymous and is described as ‘vocal, taunting and bit obnoxious’.

The group seeks to cause mayhem online ‘for a laugh’ and has called itself the ‘next generation Grinch’ after the children’s character that hates Christmas, often using Twitter to boast of upcoming attacks.

Some reports say it mainly operates from Russia but others believe it is more likely to be made up of underground networks of hackers from around the world, communicating using the ‘dark web’.

Lizard Squad has a history of targeting computer game companies, particularly Sony. 

In August it sent a bomb threat to Sony chief executive John Smedley, the same month in which it attacked Playstation just to cause ‘havoc’.

Dan Holden, of online security company Arbor Networks, said: ‘If they’re coming after you, you’re going to have a bad day.’

Originally hacker group Lizard Squad took credit for disruption over the Christmas period on Twitter 

Anonymous, which recently issued a threat to Islamic fanatics responsible for the Paris terror attacks, also claimed to have hacked thousands of accounts in December
