A man who was stunned to discover a super-rare perfectly round egg sold it on Ebay for £91.

The egg is a billion-to-one find, according to Forklift driver Mark Cameron, who shelled out just 21p for the amazing foodstuff.

The 45-year-old discovered it in a box of six eggs from a Morrisons store in Thamesmead, south London, as he started to prepare himself an omelette.

Poor chicken: Forklift truck driver Mark found a perfectly round egg in his Morrisons carton. He raised £91 by selling it on eBay

Cracking find: Mark's research uncovered just two other perfectly circular eggs

Intrigued, he did a little research and found that just two have been found in the UK in recent years, despite Brits consuming 11billion eggs every year.

So instead of cracking it for a meal he decided to put it on eBay to see how much it would fetch.

To his astonishment, the egg racked up 38 bids over five days. It was eventually sold for £91.

The egg cannot be eaten as it is know passed its sell-by-date, but that didn't deter bidders on eBay

The eBay listing read: 'Rare Unique Item, Round Chicken Egg 100 per cent real with Lion time and date stamp.

'Only One in a Billion chance of finding such an egg.

'The egg has become 'eggstreamly' popular and I have decided to donate the money raised to a UK-based charity.

'The winning bidder will decide which charity the money will go to and proof of donation will be given.

'Item will be very securely packaged within a bubble wrapped parcel.'

He adds, however, that the egg cannot be eaten as it is past its expiry date, adding: "'his is not for human consumption as it has reached its expiry date.'

Speaking this week, Mr Cameron said: 'I got home after shopping and there it was sitting in the box - a perfectly round egg.

'I took it to work and a showed it to a lot of people.

'It's certainly been a talking point. No one's ever seen anything like it.

'I've only heard of a perfectly round egg being found in Britain twice in the past few years, so it had to be worth a fair bit - it's a billion-to-one find.

'I haven't got a clue how it was formed. I wouldn't want to be the chicken who laid it, put it that way.

'And I don't fancy putting it on my toast either.'

Earlier this year mum-of-two Cassie Greenhill, of Enfield, north London, found a perfectly round egg as she prepared a meal for her 14-year-old son Harry and in 2010 one was found by chef James Church at The Hotel Bristol in Newquay, Cornwall.

Valuable: The winning bidder shelled out £91 for the unusual egg. The money will go to a charity of their choice
