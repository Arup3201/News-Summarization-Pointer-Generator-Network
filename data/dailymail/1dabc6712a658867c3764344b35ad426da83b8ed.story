Raymond Oswell’s former partner was wracked with guilt when he hanged himself after she began another relationship.

Victoria Kish-Donovan slept surrounded by his pictures and spent hours sobbing at the tree where he died, leaving flowers and notes.

Eventually, unable to cope with the grief any longer, she hanged herself from the same branch of the same tree.

Romeo and Juliet: Builder Raymond Oswell 31, was found 
hanged after girlfriend Victoria Donovan, 24, ended their romance and started dating someone else. She then took her own life, a Manchester inquest has heard

An inquest heard how Mr Oswell, 31, moved out of the couple’s home after their seven-year relationship broke down.

The former builder, however, killed 
himself after becoming inconsolable when he discovered 24-year-old Miss 
Kish-Donovan had begun seeing another man after spotting messages posted
on Facebook.

Mother-of-three Miss Kish-Donovan 
committed suicide at the same spot just two weeks later leaving a note 
on the ground saying: ‘Together forever. I love you Ray.’

The couple left their two children, a 
son aged six and a daughter aged five, along with Miss Kish-Donovan’s 
eight-year-old son from a previous relationship.

Their families wept as Manchester 
coroner Nigel Meadows read out details of the tragedy. He said: ‘This is
almost a repetition of a very famous play by Shakespeare called Romeo 
and Juliet – it could be the modern equivalent.

‘Victoria was so traumatised by 
Raymond’s death she wanted to take her own life, even though it would 
mean leaving her children and family behind. It must have been a similar
consideration for Raymond.’

He added: ‘This is a very sad set of 
circumstances for both Victoria and Raymond and their families. They may
well have had their ups and downs but they must have had a very 
committed relationship.’

Miss Donovan left a suicide note on the ground reading 'Together forever. I love you Ray' and in the run up to her death would lie in her bed surrounded by photos of her former partner (pictured)

The couple met in 2005 when Miss 
Kish-Donovan was 17 and Mr Oswell was 24. They set up home together in 
Wythenshawe, Manchester, and had two children but after seven years 
their relationship came to an end in March last year.

The body of the ‘distraught’ father was found on June 21, hanged from a tree in Hatchett’s Wood near his home.

He was discovered by his sisters after they went to search for him when he failed to return home.

Following his death, Miss 
Kish-Donovan’s family said, she was devastated and spiralled into 
depression after she became unable to cope with the guilt.

She would regularly be found at the 
tree where Mr Oswell died, which had become a shrine to him surrounded 
by photographs and flowers.

Her mother Paula Donovan, 43, said: 
‘She would go to the tree and I would try and take her away, but she 
would not stay away. She just never stopped crying; she blamed herself 
for what had happened to Ray and felt responsible.

‘She said she wouldn’t do anything to 
herself because of the kids but I felt it inside. I worried about her. 
She would lay on her bed with Ray’s pictures around her.’

On July 7 last year Miss Kish-Donovan was found hanged in the same secluded wood as Mr Oswell by a group of boys.

She still had faint signs of life but police and paramedics called to the scene were unable to save her.

Goodbye notes to her children and family and a love letter to Mr Oswell were later found in her bedroom.

Miss Kish-Donovan’s sister, Simone, 29, said: ‘Victoria and Raymond really were truly in love. They were always so close.

‘You have never met parents like them –
they were never away from the kids and would try and bring all the 
family together by cooking meals. Just from one mistake, two families 
have been ripped to pieces.’

Recording a verdict of suicide, Mr Meadows said he was satisfied that the couple had intended to kill themselves when they died.

He said: ‘She wrote two notes – one 
was a declaration of love for Ray and the other a note of guilt and 
regret. This is a very sad set of circumstances for both Victoria and 
Raymond and their families.’
