Get ready ladies, New York's 'cannibal cop' is single and ready to mingle.

Disgraced NYPD officer Gilberto Valle, 30, who was found guilty of using police resources to search women for his online abduction and death-porn fantasies, appears to have set up an online dating profile. (He is seeking slender women, who drink moderately, aged 24 -32).

He described himself as 'motivated and passionate about working hard', adding: 'I am spending my energy rebounding from the errors I made in my past and rebuilding my life.' He also professes that cooking and dining out are among his interests.

Valle has been out of jail since July after being cleared of conspiring to abduct, cook and eat women. His trial included lurid details of how he sought advice from others in the online 'death-porn' community over how to kidnap, kill and eat his wife and friends.

He was sentenced to time served in November for illegally accessing a federal database. 

He was also given a year's probation on a charge of misusing police resources to search for women as part of his fantasies.

Valle was ordered to continue mental health treatment and was banned from contacting women involved in the case.

'I really want to say I am sorry - it was not a crime but it was wrong,' Valle said outside court in November, 

Months later, Valle was back online as 'AmicableOne14'. 

He explained that his ideal woman is 'non-judgmental' with a 'positive outlook on life', adding: 'You appreciate the simple things and can make the best out of a situation that is less than ideal.'

He wrote that he works in sales and marketing, is divorced and has a child who lives away from home. 

His political views are noted as conservative and his last read was 'The Art of Thinking Clearly' by Rolf Dobelli. 

Among the pictures on the dating profile include several images with a woman cropped out, but still partially visible, another of him petting a dog and a snap of a karaoke performance. 

There is even a shot which appears to be Valle walking into a court appearance being chased by TV cameras and photographers.

Although the profile appears to be genuine, Valle claimed that he didn't know anything about it, when asked by the New York Post. However, when shown his Match.com profile, he added: 'I don’t want to see it, thanks.'

Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from Match.com on Wednesday.

During his trial, the jury heard how Valle communicated in chat rooms about killing and cooking his wife. 

He told one man he met in a fetish chat room: 'I want her to experience being cooked alive. She'll be trussed up like a turkey. ... She'll be terrified, screaming and crying.'

In another exchange, Valle suggested a woman he knew would be easy prey because she lived alone.

The chat room discussion centered on cooking the victim, basted in olive oil, over an open fire and using her severed head as a centerpiece for a sit-down meal.

Valle had been facing life in prison but the charges were thrown out in July, with the judge writing that ' more likely than not the case that all of Valle's Internet communications about kidnapping are fantasy role-play'.

The former cop's defense lawyers said Valle recognized that the substance of his Internet chats was 'deeply troubling and disturbing' and now meets weekly with a counselor to discuss it.

They added: 'Gil does not want his life's legacy to be the story of the ''Cannibal Cop.''

'He is only 30 years old and intends to make something more out of his life. Inspired by the team of people who defended his innocence, Gil wants to go to law school.'

Valle, then a patrolman for the NYPD, was arrested in October 2012 after his wife found disturbing pictures on his computer that he had downloaded from the site DarkFetishNet.com.

The FBI found a list of 100 women he said he planned to kill, cook and eat.

They also found a transcript of an online chat in which he said he planned to take his 'girlfriend' Kathleen to Pakistan, where he and another man would murder her and cannibalize her body.

Valle maintains that his extensive writings were nothing more than fantasy - never meant to be acted on or carried out.

Valle's ex-wife, who testified against her husband at trial, was granted a divorce last July. She took the couple's young daughter and completely cut off contact with Valle and his family.
