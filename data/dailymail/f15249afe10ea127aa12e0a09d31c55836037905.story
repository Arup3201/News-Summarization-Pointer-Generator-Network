This is the moment a Kurdish reporter walked to the ISIS border and confronted jihadi militants.

Hunar Ahmad, a correspondent for Kurdish-language news channel Rudaw, strolled into the middle of a bridge and shouted over to the fighters that he wanted to interview them.

The men, who were allegedly building a Caliphate border post at the site near Kirkuk, ignored Mr Ahmad before warning him not to come any closer.

Shocking: Hunar Ahmad strolled towards the murderous militants near Kirkuk calling for an interview

Dangerous: The Kurdish news reporter waved wildly at the jihadis, brandishing a red microphone

It comes after the group seized the Yazidi border town of Sanjir, telling residents: convert or die.

United Nations human rights experts have warned that the world must take 'all possible measures' to prevent a massacre of minorities in Iraq as the UK continued aid drops but resisted calls for military intervention. 

But incredibly, Mr Ahmad casually sidles up towards the border separating the murderous militants and Kurdish Peshmerga troops.

One Peshmerga soldier advises him: 'Speak Arabic if you can' - as he advances clutching a red microphone.

Holding the microphone out to the soldiers, he shouts: 'Would anyone like to speak to Rudaw?'

There is no response from the 10 men standing 100 metres away clutching a black Islamic State flag. 

'We are here close to IS militias at Merriam-Beg, they have made here the border lines,' he tells the camera, according to Rudaw's translation.

'We are here to interview anyone of them but they are refusing to talk.'

Undeterred, he tries again, waving his hand at the jihadis as he advances into No Man's Land.

No Man's Land: Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers do not dare to go near the bridge for fear of attack

Repeated attempts: Mr Ahmad kept shouting at the militants as they seemingly constructed a border

Warning: The dozen men standing by the ISIS flag warned Mr Ahmad not to come any closer to their site

He shouts details about Rudaw as tractors can be seen shovelling mounds of dirt onto the border line.

Eventually he turns back: 'We repeatedly tried to talk to the IS militias, but they are busy strengthening their frontlines right here.

'They are warning me not to get any closer.'

The militants, who have shorten their name from ISIS (The Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham) to IS (The Islamic State), are believed to be strengthening their forces at the site near Kirkuk, north of Baghdad.

It comes after they seized Sanjir, home to 500,000 Yazidis.

Thousands of the minority sect were today desperately trying to escape the bloody Islamic State militants.

Battlegrounds: The militants have seized the Yazidi town of Sanjir, north west of Kirkuk, where they are now 

Fleeing: The military helicopter crashed on a mountain as it tried to provide aid to the 500,000-strong Yazidi population in Sinjar (pictured), near the Syrian border, as they flee Sunni militants of the Islamic State

Horrific: The refugees are trying to find safety after Isil gave them the ultimatum: convert to Islam or die

They are left with little option but to head from one war zone to another as they advance on the Syrian border.

The refugees, most of them women and children, were seen today slowly walking in the agonising midday 45C sun towards the Syrian border town of Elierbeh of Al-Hasakah Governorate. 

Persecuted by ISIS for their beliefs and forced out of Sinjar, their survival options are brutal: Head for the barren Iraqi mountain range where others have been trapped by Islamic State militants for a week with no food and water - or walk the gruelling miles, often with young children to join the 10,000 to 15,000 Yazidis who have already fled to neighbouring Syria.

Aid has been sent, but a member of the Iraqi air force today warned it could take up to 500 days to rescue the 50,000 refugees unless the UK and U.S. helps with the evacuations.

Desperate: The United Nations has warned the world must take 'all possible measures' to avoid a massacre

Today, an Iraqi helicopter providing aid to the Yazidis stranded on a mountain in the area crashed and killed the pilot after too many tried to climb aboard.

Twenty evacuees were injured in the accident on a mountain in Sinjar, including Iraqi MP Vian Dakheel, a member of the minority Yazidi community.

She and others on board the Russian-built Mi-17 craft were escorted to a hospital in the nearby Kurdish autonomous region.

The Yazidis, a 500,000 strong people, follow an ancient religion with links to Zoroastrianism but are seen as infidels by the radical Islamists. 

Dakheel, the sole politician from the Yazidi community, made an impassioned plea in parliament to save her people before leaving for the north.
