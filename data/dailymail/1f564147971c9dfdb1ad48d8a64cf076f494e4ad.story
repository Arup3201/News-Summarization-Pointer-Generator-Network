 A Michelin star chef and protégé of Heston Blumenthal has been hired by Lidl as the discount supermarket chases the ‘BMW classes’.

Kevin Love, who was formerly the head chef at the multi-award winning Hinds Head pub in Bray, Berkshire, will help the budget chain source gourmet ingredients.

The role as ‘chef in residence at Lidl’ will see him going head to head with his former mentor, who has had a long-term partnership with the upmarket chain Waitrose.

The 38-year-old star chef will also feature in the chain’s commercials, help develop ‘Deluxe’ range products with ‘a few cheffy twists’ and offer recipe and cooking tips.

The move is the latest effort by Lidl to attract Middle Britain shoppers who want good food but something different – and cheaper – than the mainstream supermarkets.

This has involved pushing a range of ‘Deluxe’ foods, including Stilton, Hereford fillet steaks and Mussel & Smoked Salmon Chowder, which have beaten the best of the high street in blind taste tests.

It has also won over wealthy shoppers with fine French wines at budget prices that have picked up gold medals in international competitions.

The company’s current adverts are based around the theme of ‘Lidl Surprises’, where ordinary people are given fine food on a market stall only to be surprised that it comes from the discount store.

Its Christmas TV campaign took up the theme with diners enjoying a fabulous festive spread only to be told at the end that all the food and drink came from Lidl.

The first TV advert featuring the chef shows him cooking meals in a north London gastro pub, before wowing shocked customers by revealing the cheap cost of the Lidl-sourced ingredients.

His role will involve sourcing produce that will be stocked in Lidl's more than 600 stores in the UK and working on food development.

In a promotional video on Lidl's website, he reveals that he will be creating new lines in the firm’s deluxe range ‘with a few cheffy twists’.

The partnership with the retailer brings Mr Love full circle, for just nine years ago he was a Lidl store manager before going off to develop his skills as a chef.

Inspired by his mother’s cooking his path in the world of food began washing dishes in a Wimpy bar at the age of 14 and then peeling potatoes in the kitchens of Michelin star Catalan chef Santi Santamoria in Spain. Other jobs in cafes and bars in his native Sussex followed.

Subsequently, he saw Heston Blumenthal on TV and set his sights on working for his culinary hero. Within three months of starting at the Hinds Head he was made head chef and later won a Michelin star and three AA Rosettes.

Mr Love said: ‘Lidl has a great foundation. I’m going to be working closely with buyers, suppliers and producers to see if we can take it to the next level.

‘Take a pie for instance. What other cuts of meat can we use? Can we slow cook or braise them? How about a water bath? How can make the pastry have more bite?’

Lidl head of advertising and marketing, Arnd Pickhardt, said the partnership goes will go far beyond the usual chef endorsement or product range.

‘Chef Love has joined the Lidl family full-time and will devote himself entirely to guiding the brand and customers on a journey of culinary discovery. As the partnership matures, so will Kevin’s role at Lidl,’ he said.

‘In addition to helping customers explore the possibilities inside every Lidl shop, he will be a brand champion and passionate advocate for technical simplicity.’
