Planning permission has been granted for a 100-seat dining room and facilities for business meetings at HMP Brixton

With its famous market and vibrant street-food, Brixton is a well established haunt for foodies from across London.

From simple pizzas to meatballs in monkey gland sauce, food and flavours from around the world are available to tempt the taste buds.

But one charity is about to open a eatery that will be unfamiliar to even the most seasoned gourmet: a restaurant in a prison.

The Clink Charity has been given planning permission to convert the former Regency Roadhouse, which was the old Governor's house at Brixton Prison, into a 100-seat high quality diner.

Prisoners will then be trained to serve customers, providing them with invaluable skills to help them become employable once they are released.

Chris Moore, chief executive of The Clink Charity believes Brixton will cement the future for further Clink restaurants.

He said: 'Brixton was the perfect site for our next restaurant.

'HMP
 Brixton is undergoing a regeneration project and was looking for an 
organisation to work with to develop the building into an opportunity 
for rehabilitation.

'The central location lends itself to 
securing support from local businesses and members of the public, 
providing they are committed to The Clink's vision and once the 
necessary security checks have been processed, providing real-life 
experience for those prisoners who make it through the selection process
 to join the programme.'

The Clink Charity already runs two other prison restaurants, one in HMP Cardiff, and the other in HMP High Down, in Surrey.

In
 2012 the charity agreed a partnership with Her Majesty's Prison Service
 (HMPS) who are supporting them in a bid to open a 
further seven Clink Restaurants over the next four years.

At HMP Cardiff 30 offenders from an open part of the jail are already serving customers

Edmond
 Tullett, Governor of HMP Brixton said: 'Brixton is more than delighted 
to host the third Clink training restaurant in the Regency Roundhouse 
which dates back to 1819.

'The restaurant will provide an 
unforgettable experience for customers and an unrivalled opportunity for
 prisoners to acquire marketable skills that will lead to local jobs and
 provide a pathway to a better life.'

In addition to the 100 seat
 restaurant, the building will also include rooms for business meetings 
and working lunches.

Five rooms for companies to organise 
'phone free' meetings will provide vital income 
for the charity to continue to operate.
