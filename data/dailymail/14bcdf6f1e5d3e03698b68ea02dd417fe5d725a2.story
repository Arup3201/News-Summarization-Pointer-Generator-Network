New York City officials have blown up a vacant building to make way for a new park.

The 11-story brick apartment building on Governors Island formerly housed Coast Guard families.

The Trust for Governors Island says the building has been vacant since 1996 and does not meet current building codes.

Before: The building demolished Sunday was a former Coast Guard residence from when the military branch used the island as a base between 1966 and 1996

Time bomb: The building had been vacant since 1996 and was no longer up to current building codes

Boom: Building 877 was the largest non-historic building on the island before it was demolished Sunday

The implosion just after at 7:30 a.m. Sunday took about 10 seconds. It was overseen by the city Fire Department and the Department of Buildings.

Governors Island, a 172 acre island off the tip of lower Manhattan in New York Harbor, was a longtime military base.

The city and state now control most of the island, and are redeveloping it, with some of it becoming parkland.

Twenty-two acres of the island belong to the Governors Island National Monument which is run by the National Park Service.

The island was open to the public Sunday as normal after the implosion.

Governors Island is only open seasonally, from May to September.

Visitors can access the island via a free ferry.

The island offers biking, kayaking and live music events.

Retreat: The island is now host to many New Yorkers looking to make a quick day-trip out of the city during the summer

For most of its history, Governors Island was used as a military base. It got the name Governors Island because it was used as the official residence of the British colonial governors of New York, before the Revolutionary War.

Over the years it transferred control from the U.S. Army to the Coast Guard and was eventually sold to the people of New York.

Today, the island is run by the Trust for Governors Island which is in charge of operations, planning and redevelopment on the island.
