An internationally acclaimed opera singer died at the age of 38 after doctors failed to find a grapefruit sized tumour in her chest, an inquest heard.

Cecilia Smiga graced some of opera’s finest concert halls and had sung at leading sporting events.

For several months she had been complained of shortness of breath and tiredness.

Cecilia Smiga, 38, died after doctors failed to spot a grapefruit sized tumour growing behind her heart

In December 2012 she went to her GP who prescribed antibiotics and, when these failed to improve her condition, eventually referred her for a CT scan at Frimley Park Hospital, in Surrey, in February 2013.

Her condition worsened but the tumour, which measured 10cm by 7cm and was forming behind her heart, was not spotted on the CT scan.

It was only picked up by doctors five days before she died on April 9, 2013.

Ms Smiga was admitted to the Royal Brompton Hospital when the tumour was discovered but nothing could be done to save her.

Her father, Michael Smiga, told Westminster Coroner’s Court his daughter had been ill since August 2012.

‘The first time I was aware there was a problem was August 2012 when she referred herself to a chiropractor,’ said Mr Smiga.

Miss Smiga, an opera singer, was initially given antibiotics but these failed to improve her symptoms so she was referred for a CT scan but doctors failed to spot the tumour on the scan

‘She had a complaint of pain in her shoulder and a tight chest and a stooping posture.

‘In November 2012 we attended the Wales vs New Zealand rugby match and went home afterwards.

‘We were walking up a steep hill and she was lagging far behind me - I had never noticed that before.

‘There was another instance when I took her back to Ascot - she was walking up the stairs to her flat and she began violently vomiting - I had never seen anything quite so bizarre.’

The inquest into her death heard that the tumour could have been spotted sooner but that there was no guarantee that this would have enabled doctors to save her life.

Dr Shirley Radcliffe claimed doctors probably should have realised there was a tumour behind her heart long before it was eventually found just five days before Ms Smiga’s death.

But she said there was no evidence to suggest doctors would have found a way to save her life.

Tributes flooded in for Miss Smiga, of Ascot, Berkshire, after her death.

Family friend, Mary Edwards, said: ‘Cecilia’s family has received messages from all over the world, which shows how much she meant to so many people.

‘Cecilia brought joy into people’s lives. She was a beautiful woman with a beautiful personality.

‘Cecilia devoted a great deal of time to help charity and believed in encouraging young people.’

Owen Roberts, conductor of the Cefn Mawr-based choir Choral Variations, for whom Cecilia performed in a number of concerts, said: ‘News of her death is a huge loss. She was a lovely young lady and very talented.’

The coroner, Dr Radcliffe, recorded a narrative verdict meaning she did not believe any individual could be held responsible for the death.

She said: ‘She (Smiga) was referred to as a delightful lady and obviously well-loved by her family.

‘She was a successful professional in her music and was a fit and healthy young woman with the rest of her life to look forward to.

Miss Smiga would have been diagnosed sooner if doctors at Frimley Park Hospital had spotted the tumour on her CT scan results but the coroner accepted that this might not have allowed them to save her life

‘This was a highly unusual tumour and a very rapid deterioration in her condition.

‘She strikes me as the sort of person who did not wish to make a fuss to the point it was detrimental to her and she was a brave soul who did not want to trouble anyone.’

She added: ‘Doctors had difficulty in understanding the underlying condition and she had a lack of response to conventional treatment.

December 2012: Miss Smiga visits her GP suffering from tiredness and shortness of breath. She is given antibiotics.

The antibiotics failed to work so she was referred for a CT scan.

March 21, 2013: Miss Smiga has a CT scan at Frimley Park Hospital but doctors fail to spot the tumour.

April 4, 2013: Miss Smiga's tumour is finally detected.

April 9, 2013: Miss Smiga dies at the Royal Brompton Hospital.

‘GP enquiries as to who the best person to send her to ended up with her being sent to the hospital to review this unusual condition.

‘Events took a turn for the worse - she was quite clearly unwell and doctors felt she required a CT scan but it was not entirely clear as to how quickly that should be done.

‘She was discharged and in the meantime became yet more unwell and again ended up in hospital this time in Wrexham.

‘She was seen in A&E and the following morning was seen by a doctor who felt her condition could be dealt with by waiting for her planned CT scan that was coming up at Frimley Park hospital on March 21.

‘She became severely ill on 9 April and went to Frimley Park where her symptoms had worsened - in view of her discomfort doctors thought it was a pulmonary embolism but the scan revealed a tumour.’

The coroner explained that abnormalities were visible on the CT scan, which took place on March 21 and that an independent expert believed the tumour should have been spotted at this point.

However, the expert accepted that the tumour was hard to see because of its position.

Dr Radcliffe concluded: ‘This was a very complex situation but one could only think that an earlier diagnosis would give a possibility of a better outcome but it is not possible to say for sure in her case.’
