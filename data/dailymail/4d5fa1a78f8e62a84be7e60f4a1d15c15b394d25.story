A military transport plane has crashed into a market in the Yemeni capital killing all 10 people on board.

The collision which happened in the early hours of this morning during a training exercise over the city of Sanaa, was caused by a technical problem, security officials said.

The Russian-made Antonov aircraft plunged from the sky and crashed into an empty market in al-Hassaba district destroying several shops.

A Yemeni military transport plane crashed near the capital's airport and burst into flames, killing all ten people onboard

The market has been abandoned since 
clashes between the country's biggest tribal confederation and security 
forces in the area during last year's uprising.

Officials said the pilot tried to make an emergency landing after one of the plane's engines failed, but instead the plane crashed and caught fire.

The victims included the pilots and crew members, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity having not been authorised to talk to the media.

Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the crash site but officials said there was no indication that the plane had been sabotaged.

Yemen's
military has been engaged in a wide offensive against al-Qaida since 
last spring, and has managed to uproot the militants from strongholds in

then, al-Qaida has been blamed for a series of assassinations and 
suicide bombings that targeted top Yemeni military, intelligence and 
security officials, as well as military camps and security headquarters.

The crash comes the day after U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon pledged support for the Yemeni government's efforts to stabilize the country and transition to democracy.
