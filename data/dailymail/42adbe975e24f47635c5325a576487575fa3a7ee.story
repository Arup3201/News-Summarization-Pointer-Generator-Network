Ever since Doctor Who began in 1963 it has frequently been accused of terrifying its young fans.

But the man currently in charge of the series has defended its dark themes, claiming children enjoy being scared.

Speaking at a screening of its Christmas Day special, writer Steven Moffat said he deliberately set out to frighten youngsters, while all the jokes are aimed at adult viewers.

Thrills: Peter Capaldi as Doctor Who, who comes face to face with Santa in the Christmas Special this year

Part of the festive episode – which sees the Time Lord, played by Peter Capaldi, come face to face with Santa Claus – is so spine-tingling it had both old and young screaming in fright at the preview.

His assistant Clara Oswald, played by Jenna Coleman, is stalked by an alien life form in a sequence that would not look out of place in an adult horror film.

But Moffat said he was confident that young viewers who tune in on Christmas Day will not be unduly upset by the episode.

He said: ‘Doctor Who is scary in the way a rollercoaster is scary. It’s not scary like being trapped outside your house at night. It is fun scary.

‘The thing people never say about hiding behind the sofa, is that hiding behind the sofa is itself fun. It is a fun thing to do. Kids like being scared of Doctor Who. It doesn’t horrify them. It doesn’t petrify them. It is just an enjoyable thrill. There is nothing wrong with a bit of adrenalin.’

Moffat insisted that every episode of Doctor Who softens its moments of terror with comedy.

He said: ‘It will be a bit scary, then it will be funny, and the Doctor will get a bucket stuck on his foot. The Doctor turning up in in any scene anywhere makes it less scary, because a man in stupid clothes walks out of a phone box and says, “I can I save the world”.’

He added: ‘It is softened and made lovely by that. Kids will have nightmares about monsters whether or not Doctor Who happens. Doctor Who gives them the Doctor, a man who fights monsters and does not become one. It adds that to their dreams.’

Moffatt also argued that children are more used to scary plots than adults because their lives are intrinsically more frightening.

She said: ‘The thing about children is that they are much more serious than we are. They are much more uncertain. Children live in a scarier, bigger world than we do. Imagine living in a world where everyone is taller than you. When was the last time you had to go into a school playground being shorter than people who can beat you up?

‘Children live in a more frightening world than adults do in any civilised country. The jokes in Doctor Who are for the adults. The scares are for the kids.’

The current Doctor, actor Peter Capaldi, has admitted that his interpretation of the long-running character is ‘less user-friendly’ and a ‘little darker’ than previous incarnations.

Last month, 118 viewers complained about an episode that saw Clara’s boyfriend appear to die in a car crash and including suggestions that the bodies of the dead could feel the pain of being cremated.

Doctor Who airs on Christmas Day at 6.15pm on BBC1.
