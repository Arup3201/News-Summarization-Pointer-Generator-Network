Police say a woman in an SUV followed the mother of Eliza Delacruz as she rode the bus with her daughter in Long Beach, California, less than two hours before the three-week-old girl was kidnapped on January 3. 

Eliza was found dead in a dumpster near the Mexican border the following day. 

During the kidnapping, a man burst into the Delacruz family home and shot the infant's parents and uncle before taking the girl.

She was found in a trash bin behind a pizza restaurant in Imperial Beach, a town near the Mexican border

Sketches were released on Wednesday of both suspects. 

The girl's parents and uncle were critically injured, but once they recovered the mother recalled her encounter with the woman.  

Authorities do not think the baby's father and uncle were followed before the shooting and kidnapping. 

Police say the woman was driving a black Range Rover SUV and that she stopped the mother and spoke to her about her infant after they got off the bus.

About two hours later, Eliza was kidnapped by the gun-toting man.

She was found dead the following day in a trash bin behind a pizza restaurant 120 miles south of her home in the town of Imperial Beach.

Cameras did not capture a license plate of the SUV. 

The FBI is assisting to see if the images can be enhanced.

According to the Long Beach Police Department: 'Detectives continue to consider all possibilities as to why these crimes may have occurred. 

'At this point in the investigation, a connection between the victims and suspects has yet to be identified.' 

Police have not determined a motive and have no indication the family was in any kind of trouble.

A small memorial was created near the location of the trash bin where Eliza's dead body was dumped

Imperial Beach is about 120 miles away from the home Eliza was kidnapped from in Long Beach, California 

Long Beach police Lt. Lloyd Cox said: 'We've looked at narcotics, we've looked at human trafficking, we've looked at all kinds of things to see if there's any indication as to why somebody would pick this family.

'They went through a significant amount of effort and violence to take one three-week-old baby.

 'Why?'

The death was ruled a homicide, but details from the autopsy have been withheld because of the ongoing investigation  

The family was moved to a different location Wednesday to protect them as police released the new information. 

The names of the baby's parents and uncle have also not been released for their safety. 

Cox declined to say if the family had been under police protection since the shootings.

He said: 'They know where they live, obviously.

'Somebody may want to silence them further. 

'They've tried to kill them once already and they killed their child.

'We can't just sit back and wait.

'We're hoping that they're local and we may get something.' 

A $25,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to any arrests. 

Long Beach Police urge anyone who may be able to identify the vehicle or driver who approached the victim on January 3, 2015, to call Long Beach Homicide Detectives Donald Goodman and Mark Mattia at (562) 570-7244.

Anyone wishing to remain anonymous may call 1-800-222-TIPS (8477), or text TIPLA plus your tip to 274637 (CRIMES).
