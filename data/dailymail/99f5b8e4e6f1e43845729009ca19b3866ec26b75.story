Foreign chefs, bricklayers and tilers will no longer require a sponsor to work in Australia come July in a bid by the Federal Government to fill labour and skills shortages.

The three professions have been added to the Skilled Occupation List which means workers do not have to be sponsored by employers for a permanent visa.

But the move has been slammed by unions who say the Government should be looking out for domestic workers instead of encouraging more overseas workers to come to Australia.

Foreign chefs will no longer have to be sponsored to come work in Australia from July 1

The changes were made following advice from the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency based on labour market, education and training, migration and general economic and demographic data, and stakeholder submissions.

Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Michaelia Cash said Australian residents would always come first.

'The Abbott Government believes that where there is an Australian who is ready, willing and able to do the job, they should always be considered first,' she said.

'However, it would be simplistic to say that there is always an Australian willing and available to fill a particular position in various geographical locations within Australia, and it is the role of the skilled migration program to fill the gap where such shortages exist.

'It is important to remember that a business that is forced to close due to an inability to source vital skilled labour is a business that employs no-one.'

A Department of Immigration spokesman said figures indicated chefs have been in shortage for the past 10 years, which threatens the sustainability of the hospitality and tourism industry.

He also said the vacancy rate for the sector was more than four times the national average, according to industry experts.

The union who represents chefs is United Voice and its acting national secretary David O'Byrne said he was 'very concerned' about the move.

'We don’t think labour issues within the industry need for this to occur,' he said.

'The hospitality industry is very good at and easily able to attract staff through the industry.'

Mr O'Byrne said instead of going overseas for jobs the government should be investing in training and furthering career paths.

'In the era of Masterchef are you telling me there aren’t people who don’t want to become chefs? It just doesn’t make sense,' he said.

Tilers and bricklayers have also been added to the Skilled Occupation List that currently has 188 jobs on it

Bricklayers and tilers have also been included on the list because of a predicted increase in demand coupled with a fall in apprenticeship completions.

Based on 2012 projections by the Department of Employment, there will be a 13.4 per cent increase in the number of people employed as bricklayers over five years to November 2017 and a 17.3 per cent increase in the number of people employed as tilers occupation over the same period of time.

Michaelia Cash, the assistant minister for immigration, hopes it will help address the skills shortage in these industries

But Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union's David Noonan said the Abbott Government's reasoning for adding the three occupations to the list were unfounded.

'In particular the building trades that the government intend to put back on the list are trades where there are no shortages and even the Master Builders Association have acknowledged that,' he said.

'It seems that the Coalition again is putting the Australian workers' interest last.

'Rather than ramping up migration in these areas they should be addressing the collapse in apprentice numbers in these trades.

'It’s extraordinary the Government would do this would do this based on the evidence and to the people who pay their wages.'

The number of skilled workers to be taken in under the program has been capped at 43,990.

To ensure these industries are not dominated by overseas workers, a ceiling cap of six per cent of the workforce is enforced for all industries, but the chef workforce will be dropped to three per cent for six months from July 1 and will then be reviewed.

The department's spokesman said it would increase if no 'adverse behaviour' was identified.

Currently there are 188 jobs on the Skilled Occupation List - including accountants, social workers, psychotherapists, fitter and turners, stonemasons and teachers.
