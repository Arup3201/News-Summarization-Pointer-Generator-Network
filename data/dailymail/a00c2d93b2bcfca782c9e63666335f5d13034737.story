Rugby coach Austen Howells, 40, led a secret double life as a doting father during the week and as a drug-taker at weekends. He was found dead following a massive binge at a stag do in Stockport

An NHS director's husband who led a secret double life of drug-taking and alcohol abuse died following a massive binge at a friend's stag weekend, an inquest heard.

Rugby coach Austen Howells, 40, was hailed a 'superdad' by his family and wife Alex, who knew him as a health-conscious home-loving father of two who rarely drank.

However, Mr Howells, from St Bride's Major near Cardiff, was known to friends as 'Mr all or nothing', who regularly snorted cocaine and took pills when he was out at weekends.

His hidden life emerged last August after he died following a binge during a weekend away with 40 friends.

A post-mortem examination found he had more than five different types of drugs in his system, including cocaine, amphetamines and methadrone.

A coroner at an inquest in Stockport, Greater Manchester, today described his death as 'particularly tragic' and said he was a 'man who had everything to live for'.

The inquest heard how Mr Howells had bought 150 tablets, which he had dubbed 'super pills', prior to the weekend away with his friends in August last year.

He had stashed the drugs in his glasses case, hiding them from his wife, before travelling from Wales to Bredbury Hall Hotel and Country Club in Stockport with 40 friends for the stag do. 

The hearing was told Mr Howells was due to be master of ceremony for the wedding of bridegroom-to-be Benjamin Davies and rang him days before the stag weekend to say: 'How much shall I bring? 2/3 ounce?'. He also spoke of 'super pills'.

Mr Davies, a former teammate, told the inquest: 'He would take cocaine most weekends and I believe there were periods when he was depressed.

'Austen was a different person on the weekend than he was in the week.

'In the week he was really homely and placid but on the weekend he used to let his hair down.  Austen was "Mr all or nothing". If he was doing something like that he wanted everyone to be in it.

'He rang me the week before the stag to discuss how much cocaine to bring.

'He said something about 'super-pills', I can only assume he meant ecstasy tablets.'

He said the health fanatic had become a regular drug user and was hooked on the painkiller Tramadol following an ankle injury.

Mr Howells was found dead in a room at Bredbury Hall Hotel and Country Club in Stockport (pictured) on August 8 last year following night-out for a stag do with 40 friends. He had taken a cocktail of various drugs

The inquest heard that the stags had started drinking on the coach after meeting at a Wetherspoons restaurant in South Wales on August 8.

Once arriving at the hotel, the group began drinking in the hotel bar and following an all-night binge Mr Howell's was found in his room, at about 5.30am, where he was 'talking gibberish', the inquest heard.

Mr Davies saw cocaine on the desk and a friend went into his bag and opened the glasses case to see the haul of grey speckled pills.

Mr Davies said: 'I assumed they were the pills he mentioned the week before on the phone, the super pills.

'He took about three in one go. Then I think he took another and gave me another.'

He added that they went to another room where they drank more and Mr Howells pulled more from his pocket despite being 'right out of it' and 'delirious'.

He said he got the impression that he was helping himself to more because 'it took a long time to kick in' and went on: 'He took another one. He would go round the boys and offer them it, share them out.'

Mr Howells, a rugby player and coach, was hailed a 'superdad' but hid a secret life of drug-taking and alcohol abuse at weekends, according to friends

As the binge continued into the morning, three of Mr Howells' friends opted to stay with him rather than go to watch a St Helen's rugby match which they had travelled to Stockport for. 

Ejike Uzoigwe said: 'He was talking about "I have got something with me", what I would describe as pills, sort of bluish greyish. 

'He didn't make any sense he was sweating, a bit agitated, he was going on about demons in his head. He would say, "think of a happy place think of a happy place".'

He said that he and another stag party reveller James Donavan spent three hours with their friend before briefly leaving him in the room. When Mr Donovan returned at about 2pm, he found Mr Howells unresponsive on the floor.

Tests found he had cocaine, amphetamines, methadrone, diazepam, tramadol and AMT, an ecstasy-type drug, in his system.

Police also found text and Facebook messages in which Mr Howells had spoken of 'high grade stuff', adding: 'It's banging stuff got it from the horse's mouth.'

One Facebook message said: 'Still haven't slept since Friday, on a bender got high-graded' while another read: 'Not going to make money, it's for the boys and Ben'.

The Stockport hearing was told how Mrs Howells, 46, an executive director for NHS Wales, knew nothing of her husband's drug taking.

The Welshman, who played rugby semi-professionally with Bridgend Ravens and was coaching with Maesteg, was described as a 'natural father' by Mrs Howells who he married in 1999.

In a statement she said she loved her husband for his 'energy, life and fun' and added: 'Everyone loved him, he didn't judge people on status or job.

'He didn't like drinking or going out, he was a serious sportsman. He was a natural father.

'His friends called him superdad. We were happy and good family unit. The children had the healthiest lunch boxes.

'Rugby Sevens, that was his thing. He had never been a big one for going out.'

She said that in the run up to his death they were in 'the happiest time' of their lives and had 'enjoyed a great family life'.

Mr Howells' sister Samantha Freeman said her brother had been a 'stay-at-home dad' and an 'extremely doting father' who had never mentioned any drug use.

She told the inquest: 'As a family Austen would always drive. A lot of people were shocked because Austen never used to drink alcohol.'

She added that although he had seen a mental health nurse in relation to depression he was never diagnosed.

Stockport Coroners Court heard that the quantity of the drugs individually did not kill Mr Howells outright, but that as a cocktail they are likely to have triggered his cardiac arrest.

Recording a narrative verdict, coroner Joanne Kearsley said Mr Howell's was a 'young man who everything to live for'.

She said: 'It is particularly tragic when someone who in many ways was clearly a talented, dedicated and respected individual who spent time developing and fostering youth talent, died in such a needless and senseless way.

'He appeared to be a man who lived an almost paradoxical life, health-conscious, sporty, family man but someone sadly who had an unhealthy long-standing drug habit. 

'He brought the vast majority of drugs to that weekend, he wasn't the only person to take drugs. It is in my view quite a shameful day when I hear that such drug taking is prevalent in rugby circles.

'He was a young man who had everything to live for. He was clearly respected in the community, it is a waste of talent. I hope others here that message loud and clear.'
