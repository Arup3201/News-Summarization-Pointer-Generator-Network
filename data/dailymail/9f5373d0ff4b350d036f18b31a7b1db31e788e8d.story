Wayne Rooney is no stranger to the karaoke machine, having been filmed warbling his way through Ed Sheeran's track Lego House in a Manchester pub last month.

And now it seems that the England captain has been at it again, this time while celebrating with wife Coleen and his fellow Manchester United players at the team Christmas party.

Rooney, who is currently having scans on a potential knee injury, posted this image on his Instagram page with the caption: 'My turn to do a song at the Manchester United Christmas party!'

In another image, which appears to be from the same event, the England striker can be seen watching someone else perform alongside wife Coleen (left) and teammates Ashley Young and Darren Fletcher (right)

In the picture the forward, who is a fan of Stereophonics and Queen, can be seen with a look of concentration on his face while clicking his fingers along to the music.

He is standing on stage at The Place Aparthotel, a converted former warehouse in Manchester, surrounded by the venue's house band.

In a second shot, which appears to be from the same event, Rooney is standing in the crowd apparently watching someone else perform alongside his wife, her friends and teammates Ashley Young and Darren Fletcher.

Rooney has also been pictured singing in the past, such as in this karaoke bar in Barbados while on holiday with Coleen and his children. He sang seven tracks, including Queen We Are The Champions

At the start of November Rooney was videoed singing along to Lego House along with musician Ed Sheeran in The Sir Ralph Abercromby pub in central Manchester.

The millionaire footballer was filmed sitting on a stool with a pint of lager on the table next to him, and at times closed his eyes and clasped his hands together as he sang one of his favourite songs.

The crowd joined in although at times those watching could be heard giggling as Rooney struggled to hit some of the notes.

Long before his rise to international fame as England's captain and star striker, Wayne Rooney seems to have harboured an ambition to be a musician.

During his days playing at Everton he was rumoured to be making a rap track with Mark Morrison, who sang 'Return of the Mack' which was UK number 1 in 1996.

Rooney also claims to know all the words to every song in Oliver, and has the title of a Stereophonic album - Just Enough Education to Perform - tattooed on his arm.

In 2007, he serenaded then-girlfriend Coleen McLoughlin with Lionel Richie's All Night Long after a Valentines Day meal in Manchester. 

Wayne, 29, later documented their late night drinks by sharing a fun post-show snap with his 10.1 million Twitter followers.

The Manchester United forward is known for his love of music and has the title of the Stereophonics' album Just Enough Education to Perform tattooed on his arm.

And in 2011 he took to the stage while on holiday in Barbados with his family to sing a seven-song set on a karaoke machine in a bar.  

He belted out Queen hit We Are The Champions and Yesterday by The Beatles after asking people for requests.

He later tweeted: 'Having a great night in Barbados! In lexys piano bar with ColeenRoo and friends. Been on the mic for about 7 songs and felt like a rock star'.

Rooney has long harboured musical ambitions, and during his early days of playing at Everton he was rumoured to be making a rap record with Mark Morrison - who's song 'Return of the Mack' was a UK number one single in 1996.

Rooney also once revealed via his webpage that he is a fan of 50 Cent, Jay Z and the Arctic Monkeys - and claims to know every song from the musical Oliver. 

His musical charms also extended to his love life. In 2007 he serenaded then-girlfriend Coleen McLoughlin with Lionel Richie's All Night Long in a Manchester restaurant after a Valentine's Day meal.

United and England defender Chris Smalling and his girlfriend Sam Cooke were also at the Christmas bash

After a rough start to the season under new manager Louis van Gaal,  Manchester United have found their form recently, and after four consecutive wins in the Premier League finally have something to celebrate over the festive period.

Also at the Christmas bash were Marouane Fellaini, the Belgian midfielder who scored yesterday in United's 2-1 win over Stoke, and striker Robin van Persie, who was pictured next to Fellaini wearing a giant fuzzy wig - mocking his teammates signature hairstyle.

England and United defender Chris Smalling also put in an appearance alongside his glamorous girlfriend Sam Cooke, alongside Colombian super-star Radamel Falcao and his pregnant wife Lorelei Taron.

United old-guard Ryan Giggs was also seen partying the night away before being driven away in the early hours with wife Stacey asleep on his lap.
