A mining enthusiast has built his very own 150ft ironstone mine replica in his back garden.

John Wiggins has spent 13 years making the perfect 19th century model in the farmland at his home in Skelton Green, Teesside.

Despite being located just 15 feet underground, the mine deceptively feels as if it is hundreds of metres below the surface.

Labour of love: For the past 13 years, John Wiggins has been building a 1840s Ironstone mine at the bottom of his garden

The depths: The mine is only 15ft deep but feels like it's much farther under the earth

Blackness: The 68-year-old thought up the idea after moving to Cleveland, which was once home to over 100 iron mines, producing over 444,000 tonnes of iron every year between the 1880s to the 1930s

The 68-year-old thought up the idea after moving to the Cleveland area, a part of the country which was once home to over 100 iron mines, producing over 444,000 tons of iron every year between the 1880s to the 1930s.

Thousands of men and boys were employed to work as miners, making it a vital national industry.

John, a painter, said: 'The mine is as close to a 100 per cent replica of a Cleveland Ironstone mine as you will find.

'I moved in here 15 years ago - the house is a barn conversion with a conventional garden but plenty of land.

'Having moved from out of the area, I started to become interested in local history and this part of the world is notorious for its mining background.

'I began talking to an unemployed local lad and we both shared an interest in medieval ruins.'

Accurate: The mine was mostly built using salvaged authentic materials that John scoured the region for

Tunnel: Many of the fixings in the structure were actually used in mines

He added: 'I visited a mine nearby in North Skelton, and it was an experience I will never forget.

'But it made me want to preserve Cleveland's identity so, as you do, I decided to dig up the garden!'

John embedded two shafts into an embankment and installed a headstock tower - where men and ironstone would be lifted in an out of the mine.

He also fitted a headstock for the upcast shaft that allows the mine to be ventilated and allows a small amount of light into the ground below.

Underground, he dug up the land using a JCB and built subterranean mine workings - a narrow gauge where a railed tramway led to a tippler staith and tubs of ironstone from the mine were tipped into the carts below.

The whole operation is ventilated to ensure water does not get in and flood the underground area.

His latest addition to the model mine is a lamp house, situated on the ground above, which draws air into the mine and would have been where lamps were cleaned and prepared ready to take down into the pit.

Left for John to complete is a mine office, which will be built close to John's house.

John said: 'I have spent 13 years completing the mine but I want it to look authentic, like it's from the 1840s.

Into the daylight: John extensively researched the iron industry of Cleveland for the mammoth undertaking

Echoes of history: John said: 'I want it to look abandoned, as if miners have just up and left'

Structure: John still has to build a mine office, which will be close to his house

'I want it to look abandoned, as if miners have just up and left.

'I believe it's the only one of its type in the country.'

'I've loved every minute building it and there's never been a point where I've said to myself, I'm sick of this.

'It will be very interesting for anyone interested in history and ironstone mining.'

John has used all reclaimed materials to build the mine, collecting them from local builders, scrapyards and local markets to make it as authentic as possible.

He said: 'Everything is an exact version of what was in the smaller old mines.

'I've consulted experts, used my own knowledge of ironstone mines and read lots of old books to get everything accurate.

'It's a very green project - I've also planted wild flowers and plants, and hope to attract natural wildlife and birds to the site.'

Built next to the roman road, 'Via de Whitby', John is hoping his project will help put Cleveland back on the mining map and act as a tribute to those who worked on them.

Track: These rails (left) were used to transport carts laden with ore. The shaft is ventilated for safety (right)

Deep: John's recreation has with two minehead shafts, a narrow gauge tramway and 150ft of subterranean mine tunnelling

He said: 'I've had potash miners visit whose fathers were in the ironstone mines and they say it's just like the real thing.

'There's no memorial like this to the ironstone miners of Cleveland.

'And without Cleveland's ironstone, there would be no Teesside steel industry as we know it today.'

He hopes that people with an interest will come and see how an iron mine used to run, first-hand.

He said: 'It's lots of fun. In my mind I can't spend an afternoon inside when there's exciting things to do outside.

John, describes himself as single, but is still hoping for a young lady who would like to share a ruin in a nature reserve.

He is prepared to welcome organised groups if they want a free tour of his site.
