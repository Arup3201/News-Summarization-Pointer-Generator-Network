The Sandy Hook elementary students who survived the shooting massacre are returning to classes in a neighboring town.

The children are being bused to the nearby town of Monroe, where a former middle school Chalk Hill was renovated for them shortly after the shootings in Newtown, Connecticut.

Several hundred students are 
starting their first full school year since the December 14 shootings by Adam Lanza which left 20 students and six teaching staff dead.

Prior to the massacre, Lanza killed his own mother at their home. The gunman killed himself as police arrived at the school. The motive remains unclear.

The Newtown school board will incorporate new security measures, according to CNN.

They include armed guards and real-time monitoring systems. 

Town
voters will be asked in October to approve plans to demolish the school
where the massacre occurred and build a new one on the same property.

The new school's design will be funded with a $750,000 grand from the state of Connecticut, First Selectman Patricia E. Llorda has said.

The referendum will also allow voters to decide whether or not to approve plans to spend the remaining $50million from the state grant.

The school will not be demolished until this final vote. They hope that a new school will be open by September 2016.
