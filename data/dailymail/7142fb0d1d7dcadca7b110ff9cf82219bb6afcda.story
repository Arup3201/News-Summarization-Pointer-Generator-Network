A man who had racially abused a stranger was knocked out by one punch and left unable to even drink through a straw after his victim's brother 'saw red' and hit him from behind.

Zack Collins had made insulting remarks to random people in the street as he staggered home from a nightclub in Plymouth with a friend.

One of these comments was aimed at the brother of Sami Krasniqi - who later hit Collins after he had become fed up with his family enduring racist abuse on an almost daily basis. 

Krasniqi knocked out Mr Collins with a single punch - leaving him with six missing teeth, a broken bone in his ear canal and a fractured jaw. Mr Collins was unable to eat solid foods for two weeks because of the injuries to his jaw, and was in so much pain he could not suck up blended food through a straw.

Krasniqi (circled right) walked up to him and punched from behind 

Plymouth Crown Court heard that Krasniqi, who pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm, had only intended to give Mr Collins 'a fat lip' when he walked up to him and hit him from behind. CCTV showed Krasniqi putting Mr Collins in the recovery position when he fell to the floor after he punched him.

Krasniqi was arrested and jailed for eight months for the attack.

The court heard Mr Collins had been out clubbing with a friend in Plymouth and was highly intoxicated when he left and the pair began walking home at 6am on June 22.

He made a number of abusive comments to strangers in the street, including to a man who turned out to be Krasniqi's brother.

Mr Collins's friend told police he held him back and apologised for his comments, before dragging him away from Krasniqi's brother, who he had just insulted.

CCTV operators spotted the pair and tracked them, apparently catching Mr Collins making a comment to a black man, while Krasniqi and his brother walked behind.

The court heard then the 'red mist came down' for Krasniqi - and despite only intending to give Mr Collins a 'fat lip' - Krasniqi punched him once, hard, to the back of the head.

This single punch knocked Mr Collins out and he fell to the floor.  

Alistair Verheijen, prosecuting, said Mr Collins lost two of his upper front teeth, four of his lower front teeth, and suffered a cut to his cheek, a fractured jaw, and an inch-long cut to his tongue. A bone in his ear canal was also fractured.

After he saw Mr Collins insult a black man Krasniqi walked up to him and punched him hard in the head 

He said Mr Collins was in such pain and discomfort he was even unable to suck up blended food through a straw.

Officers who arrested Krasniqi also found he had a knife with a two-and-a-half inch blade, but the court heard this was not used in the attack and he had it with him because he used it for work.  

Nigel Hall, defending, said Krasniqi had not realised the man he was following was Mr Collins, who had earlier abused his brother. 

He also said members of his family had endured 'some form of racial abuse' on a daily basis and a 'red mist came down.'  Krasniqi had become fed up with the constant racist abuse, having also been subjected to a tirade of comments from a woman earlier that evening who he had accidentally bumped into.

Krasniqi was arrested by police and jailed for eight months after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm 

Mr Hall said Krasniqi was 'absolutely remorseful' and never intended to seriously harm Mr Collins.

He said Krasniqi 'has to realise he can't take the law into his own hands – he knows that racial abuse isn't going to stop and he has to learn how to deal with it.' 

The court heard Krasniqi was already subject to a 12 month sentence, suspended for 18 months after an incident the previous December where he threw a glass at a woman in a pub.

Judge Alan Large sentenced Krasniqi to four months for breaching the suspended sentence and eight months for the latest offence to run consecutively, totalling 12 months.
