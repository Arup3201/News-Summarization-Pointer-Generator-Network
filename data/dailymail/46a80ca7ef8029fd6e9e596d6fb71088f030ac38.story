The Swiss public could be about to back a law which would stop company bosses earning more than 12 times more than their lowest paid employee.

Campaigners from Young Socialists Switzerland, a youth arm of the Swiss 
Socialist Party, are now 'pulling out all the stops' to ensure a win 
when the country votes on the proposed law on November 24.

The latest opinion polls, published yesterday, showed support for and against tied on 44 per cent after earlier polls predicted defeat for those pledging to vote for the law in the referendum.

The campaign has targeted UBS investment bank CEO Andrea Orcel after claiming his pay is 194 times higher than the lowest paid employee

As part of the campaign, the left-wing activists have launched a 'fat cat of the week' competition on their facebook page, targetting UBS' CEO Andrea Orcel, whose pay is 194 times higher than the lowest paid employee, they claim.

He also received a $29million (£17.9million) payment when he joined the investment bank in 2012, though Switzerland has already 
passed a law forbidding these so-called 'golden handshakes'.

The new move, which is fiercely opposed by the Swiss banking sector, had been expected to fail after being criticised by both right-wing and centre politicians.

Activists from Switzerland's Young Socialists have been projecting campaign material onto the UBS building and are organising a rally for November 2

However the recent polls have given hope to activists who have begun projecting campaign material onto banking buildings, and are organising a rally for November 2.

David Roth, head of the youth group, said: 'It’s better than previous polls which only gave 35 percent in favour, but it could still vary between 10 or 15 per cent for each side.'

That means campaigners still have their work cut out to ensure it passes, he added.

Switzerland hosts two referendums a year by postal vote, which form the cornerstone of Swiss democracy.

Earlier this month a petition signed by 120,000 people called on the Swiss government to ensure a minimum income of $2,800 (£1,700) per month for every worker in the country.

The petition was backed by enough people to force a vote on the issue in parliament, though no date has yet been set.
