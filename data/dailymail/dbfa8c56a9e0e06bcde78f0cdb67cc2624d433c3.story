A groom told he may never walk again without crutches fulfilled his dream of making it down the aisle without them - after his legs were injected with Botox.

James Taylor, 22, from Birmingham, was left barely able to walk after slipping down a flight of stairs at the city's New Street station just before Christmas 2012.

Doctors diagnosed him with the rare condition snapping hip syndrome - which causes a snapping sensation in their hips when walking - and told him he would probably be in agony and struggle to walk for the rest of his life.

Celebration: James Taylor and his bride Sarah on their wedding day in New York's Times Square. Reliant on crutches after a bad fall, he made a miraculous recovery in time for his wedding after Botox injections helped him walk again

In most cases, the condition is caused by the movement of a muscle or tendon over a bony part of the hip and can cause pain and weakness in the joint.

Mr Taylor was offered surgery on his hips, but was warned there was a risk of him losing the use of his legs completely.

But, after agreeing to a course of experimental Botox treatment, the marketing manager has finally been able to ditch his crutches - and was able to walk down the aisle to marry his bride Sarah, 22.

The treatment is thought to strengthen the muscles causing the snapping in the hip. This enables the patient to put pressure on the leg without it 'going' from under them.

Just married: Mr Taylor was left barely able to walk after slipping down a flight of stairs just before Christmas 2012. Doctors warned him he would probably be in agony and struggle to walk for the rest of his life

Mr Taylor said: ‘I was in absolute agony with my legs.

‘I took a tumble down the steps at the station, when I got up it was really sore, but I felt more embarrassed then anything.

‘Later that night no amount of painkillers were going to get rid of the pain I was having, and so the next day I was forced to go to the doctors.

‘The doctor gave me crutches and I just couldn't get about without them. I was in so much pain and I felt so useless.

'I have a two-year-old son, Alfie, who I wasn't able to look after, and it really got to me when I was off work and I couldn't even look after him.

Choices: Mr Taylor was offered surgery on his hips, but was warned there was a risk of him losing the use of his legs completely. But after having experimental Botox treatment, he was able to ditch his crutches and walk down the aisle to his bride Sarah

‘I kept thinking I was going to lose my job and if that happened, how was I going to support my young family?

'I couldn't even imagine how I would be able to walk down the aisle on my wedding day.’

Doctors diagnosed Mr Taylor with the rare 
condition snapping hip syndrome - which causes a snapping sensation in 
the hips when walking.

In most cases, the condition is caused by
the movement of a muscle or tendon over a bony part of the hip and can 
cause pain and weakness in the joint.

Botox is thought to strengthen 
the muscles causing the snapping in the hip. This enables the patient to
put pressure on the leg without it 'going' from under them.

Mr Taylor underwent the 10-minute experimental treatment at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham.

There, doctors gave him four Botox injections - two into the buttock area and two around the upper thigh area. He was able to walk unaided again within days.

As the Botox wears off, Mr Taylor may need further injections to help his mobility.

He added: ‘I really needed answers and to be able to walk again without being struck down by the excruciating pain.

‘I was passed from doctor to doctor, and I ended up seeing a consultant, who told me I could either have surgery, or trial this Botox treatment.

‘I couldn't carry on the way I was, so I felt like I had nothing to lose by giving it a go.’

And after just a week of Botox treatment
in September, Mr Taylor had already ditched the crutches and was able 
to start to walk unaided.

A month later, he was able to walk as
normal - and he and his partner decided to fulfil their dream of tying 
the knot in New York.

Mr
Taylor said: ‘As we walked through the city in our wedding regalia, 
people were looking at us and asking if they could take photos of us and
they would send them us.

‘Being
a camera enthusiast, I said yes and we've been receiving our wedding 
snaps through email from budding photographers who just wanted to take a
photo of us.’

The couple tied the knot on the famous Gapstow Bridge in Central Park.

Botox injections have been used to treat patients with a range of different muscular conditions.

They
have been used to treat neck pain and neck muscle spasms, eyelid 
spasms, crossed eyes, severe underarm sweating, muscle stiffness and 
migraines.

On the mend: Just a week after the Botox treatment in September, Mr Taylor had already ditched the crutches and was able to start to walk unaided. He may need further injections as the Botox wears off

As the Botox wears off, Mr Taylor may need further injections to help his mobility.

He said: ‘All this happened just before Christmas and before our wedding, it was looking to be a really bad year.

‘Now,
I've married the woman of my dreams, I have my legs back for Christmas 
and I'll be able to play in the snow with my little boy this Christmas. 
What more could I ask for?'
