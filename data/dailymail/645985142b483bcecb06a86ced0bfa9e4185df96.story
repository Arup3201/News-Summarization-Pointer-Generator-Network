An immediate ceasefire is necessary for talks to happen over eastern Ukraine, Vladimir Putin said yesterday.

The Russian president said he expects Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine’s president-elect, to show ‘goodwill’ and ‘state wisdom’ in dealing with the issue.

He and Mr Poroshenko shared a symbolic handshake yesterday as they met for 15 minutes to discuss the main issues related to settling the crisis.

Putin has 
described the events in Ukraine leading to Mr Poroshenko's election as a
 'coup', while the government in Kiev has accused Russia of fomenting 
conflict in its eastern regions, parts of which have declared themselves
 independent.

Putin also said that Moscow is ready for constructive discussion with Ukraine on settling its gas debt to Russia.

He
 said that he and Poroshenko discussed the main 
issues related to settling the crisis. The leader said he welcomes 
Poroshenko's position that the bloodshed in eastern Ukraine needs to be 
stopped.

Poroshenko,
 speaking to journalists in Normandy, said that he expects a statement 
from Russia about the recognition of his election, according to the 
Interfax news agency.

Topic of conversation: Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the two men spoke of 'the soonest end to bloodshed in south-eastern Ukraine and combat actions by both parties' - separatists and Kiev's armed forces

The
 meeting between Putin and Poroshenko came on the same day that Putin 
spoke with President Barack Obama, who had been keeping the Russian 
leader at arm's length over the Ukrainian crisis that has rekindled Cold
 War-era tensions.

Putin's
 spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the two men spoke of ‘the soonest end to 
bloodshed in south-eastern Ukraine and combat actions by both parties’ -
 separatists and Kiev's armed forces. 

They ‘confirmed that there is no alternative to settling the situation by peaceful political means’.

With Merkel in close attendance the two men spoke after a photocall of leaders attending the Normandy commemoration. 

All three stood up during the impromptu meeting, with Peskov confirming the session was ‘on their feet’.

Putin
 has not been invited for chocolate billionaire Poroshenko's 
inauguration on Saturday in Kiev but Moscow confirmed he would be 
represented by an ambassador.

Relations between the two ex-Soviet republics collapsed after Moscow claimed the West backed a coup of ‘fascist’ forces in Kiev and staged an audacious grab for Crimea, a region almost as large as Belgium.

Tense: Meanwhile tanks were seen standing by at Slovyansk in the disputed Donetsk region, where five Ukrainian soldiers were wounded today

Loading up: Soldiers pile shells into their tank in anticipation of more fighting. Ukrainian authorities say 200 people have died over the past few weeks

Proxy: Ukraine has claimed that Russia is behind the unrest in its eastern regions, which declared independence last month

Near-bankrupt
 Ukraine claims Russia is fomenting unrest in its eastern regions amid 
fears it could seek to annex far more territory. 

Putin
 earlier said that Poroshenko ‘still has no blood on his hands’ while 
urging a halt to Kiev's crackdown on separatist fighters in eastern 
Ukraine. 

Russia has yet to recognise the result of the Ukrainian election, and until now has maintained the position that Viktor Yanukovych, toppled by a coup, was the legitimate president. 

Merkel spent time with both men before bringing them together for what the West hopes will be the start of solution to the Ukrainian crisis. 

Putin - a KGB spy in East Germany during the Cold War - is seen as closer to Merkel than any other Western leader.
