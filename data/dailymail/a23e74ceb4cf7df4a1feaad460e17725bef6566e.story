A San Francisco sheriff's deputy who was accused of forcing inmates to perform sex acts on him in 2006 is now alleged to have organized 'gladiator style' fights between prisoners.

Deputy Scott Neu was accused of orchestrating two fights at County Jail No. 4 between inmates Ricardo Palikiko Garcia and Stanley Harris as deputies placed bets on the outcome, Jeff Adachi, the city's public defender, said on Thursday.

Three other deputies Evan Staehely, Eugene Jones and Clifford Chiba have also been accused of forcing the inmates to fight.

The alleged matches took place in March when Garcia and Harris were promised hamburgers if they won, or were threatened with Mace, handcuffed beatings and transfers to dangerous housing quarters if they refused to fight, according to a report.

San Francisco public defender Jeff Adachi (above during a press conference on March 26, 2015) has alleged that Deputy Scott Neu is ringleader behind organized fights between inmates that took place in March

Neu was the subject of two sexual assault lawsuits in 2006 and 2008, which were settled out of court. 

All four deputies have been placed on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation.

'These revelations are sickening,' said Adachi. 'Deputy Neu forced these young men to participate in gladiator-style fights for his own sadistic entertainment.' 

Ricardo Palikiko Garcia, 23, pictured, said Neu forced him to fight and promised him hamburgers if he won and beatings if he refused

Garcia, 23, told investigators that he does not know why Neu does it but believes he gets a kick out of it, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

'It looks like it brings him joy by doing this, while we’re suffering by what he’s doing,' he said.

Garcia, who weighs 150-lb, said he was forced twice to fight Harris, who weights 350-lb. 

Both men were injured in the bouts but were threatened with beatings if they sought medical treatment.

In a recorded conversation with Adachi, Harris said that Neu, as part of 'training', made him do 200 push-ups within an hour, and also threatened to anally rape him.

He also said Neu had a tattoo reading '850 Mob' in reference to the address of the county jail at 850 Bryant Street. 

Another inmate, Jonathan Christopher, said that Neu carried dice and playing cards he would use to make inmates gamble against him for benefits such as food and clean laundry.

Adachi said he went public with details from the report prepared by private investigator Barry Simon to forestall a planned jailhouse fight meant to take place next week.

He hired Simon after a public defender heard about the fights from Garcia's father on March 12.

Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi (above speaking during the press conference on Thursday) has moved both Garcia and Harris from the jail and said he does not accept the alleged barbaric behavior in the county jail system

The San Francisco Deputy Sheriff's Association called the allegations 'exaggerated' and that the fighting was 'little more than horseplay'.

'(Adachi) has done a cursory sham investigation by interviewing a few inmates over a scant two days rather than having the decency to request a serious impartial investigation,' said Harry Stern, an attorney for the deputy's union.

'It is unfortunate that Mr. Adachi didn’t initiate a formal complaint that would have been investigated thoroughly by the appropriate agencies. 

'The investigators would have had the opportunity to interview witnesses, including the accused deputies, and look for physical evidence.' 

San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi said he does not accept any kind of culture within the county jail system that reports such barbaric and unlawful activities, according to ABC.

Mirkarimi has moved the affected inmates to another facility, and Adachi has called for an investigation by state or federal officials.

Another inmate said they had to bet Neu for benefits such as food and clean laundry. Adachi made the information public once he got word that there was another planned fight meant to take place next week (above County Jail No. 4)
