This is the dramatic moment a brave police officer grabs his shot colleague and pulls him to safety during a stakeout with a gunman.

Despite the rain of gunfire the brave policeman dodged the bullets to get wounded officer Paul Hutchison to safety.

The identity of the heroic Mephis Police Tactical, or TACT, Unit officer is unknown,however, it was believed that Mr Hutchison, who was shot in the thigh, would have been killed were it not for the actions of his quick-thinking colleague.

Shooting: Officer Paul Hutchison was shot as he tried to arrest a suspect wanted for attempted murder

Safety: The unnamed officer then dragged Mr Hutchison behind a parked car and out of the line of fire

Mr Hutchison and his partner had been trying to arrest suspect Aaron Dumas, who had barricaded himself inside his home in Memphis, Tennesse, USA, when the shot which injured Mr Hutchison was fired in the stakeout.

Mobile phone footage taken at the scene shows the moment Mr Hutchison was shot, before the other officer comes to the rescue.

He was being hailed a hero today, after managing to drag Mr Hutchison, who has served with the Memphis Police for 15 years, behind a nearby vehicle.

Following the shooting Dumas, who police believe was also behind the shooting of another officer from the elite TACT unit, Timothy Jackson, torched his home in the south of the city while still inside.

His body was later found among the charred remains of the house, slumped inside a bath.

Mr Hutchison and Mr Jackson, who was shot in the leg just hours before his colleague, were both said to be recovering from their ordeal after they were both released from hospital.

Waiting game: The police officers had been engaged in a stand off with the suspect when Paul Hutchison was shot

Dumas had been wanted by police on attempted murder charges after a woman, believed to have been his girlfriend and her brother were shot in an argument earlier this month.

They were both treated in hospital and described by medics as being in 'good condition'.

The shooting was believed to have been sparked when police officers threw tear gas into the home, with Dumas firing back, hitting Mr Hutchison.

Mr Jackson, who has been with the TACT unit for five years, had been shot four hours before the second attack on Tuesday.

Neighbour James Wihite, 79, had been walking close to the scene when officers first tried to enter Dumas's home. 

'I heard one shot,' Wilhite told Memphis newspaper The Commercial Appeal.

'Immediately following that, I heard a volley of shots. Then immediately after, an officer came out limping, supported by another officer. He was limping, noticeably in pain.'
