A new US study may make you think twice about biting into a piece of lettuce.

Scientists claim plants can feel themselves being eaten alive – and some can even tell what type of creature is attacking them.

The discovery was made after tests on the Arabidopsis plant  found it can distinguish between insects eating it based on the way they chew and drool.

'It was no surprise that plants responded differently to having their leaves chewed by a caterpillar or sucked by an aphid,' Heidi Appel, senior research scientist University of Missouri told the Washington Post.

'What surprised us was how different plant responses were to each of the caterpillars and aphids. The plants could clearly tell insects apart - they really seem to "know" who's attacking.'

Professor Appel exposed a group of Arabidopsis, which is part of the cabbage family, to cabbage butterfly caterpillars and beet army worms.

She predicted that as the insects eat the plant, Arabidopsis could tell by the chewing motion and the drool whether the creature was a butterfly or a worm.

She also believed that the plant could tell several different insects apart, even when they were eating the leaves simultaneously. 

To test her theory, she harvested the chewed up Arabidopsis, extracted the genes, and froze it in a laboratory.

Plants attempt to defend themselves using different methods, such as giving off spicy flavours and rancid smells. These defences are expressed in their genes.

Researchers in Bonn, Germany, found plants give off a gas when under 'attack'.

Super-sensitive microphones picked up a 'bubbling' sound from a healthy plant.

But this rose to a piercing screech when it was under threat.

Even a tiny insect bite could have an effect.

'The more a plant is subjected to stress, the louder the signal,' said Dr Frank Kühnemann.

Plants do not actually scream in pain. But different sounds are heard when the gas they emit, ethylene, is bombarded with lasers.

The research could help to work out which pieces of fruit and vegetables are likely to stay fresh longer, as a cucumber which is starting to go off produces a squealing sound.

It could then be separated from the fresher ones.

Based on the gene analysis, Professor Appel found that the plant can sense when a caterpillar is drooling and provides a different defence mechanism, than if it sensed a butterfly.

There were also different genetic responses to each worm, showing that the plant knew what was eating it.

Professor Appel hopes that this will allow scientists to breed plants that are naturally insect resistant rather than spraying them with pesticides.

The research builds on a study last year that found plants can identify sounds nearby, such as the sound of eating, and then react to the threats in their environment.

In this study, caterpillars were placed on Arabidopsis.

Using a laser and a tiny piece of reflective material on the leaf of the plant, scientists measured the movement of the leaf in response to the chewing caterpillar.

Professor Appel then played back recordings of caterpillar feeding vibrations to one set of plants, but played back only silence to the other set of plants.

When caterpillars later fed on both sets of plants, the researchers found that the plants previously exposed to feeding vibrations produced more mustard oils, a chemical that is unappealing to many caterpillars.

'What is remarkable is that the plants exposed to different vibrations, including those made by a gentle wind or different insect sounds that share some acoustic features with caterpillar feeding vibrations did not increase their chemical defences,' co-author Rex Cocroft, said.

'This indicates that the plants are able to distinguish feeding vibrations from other common sources of environmental vibration.'
