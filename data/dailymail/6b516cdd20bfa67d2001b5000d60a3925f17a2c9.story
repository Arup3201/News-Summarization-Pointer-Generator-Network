Distraught: Driver Shannon McGarrigle told an inquest of the moment schoolboy Sam Belcher stepped out in front of her

A teenage driver has told of the moment a suicidal schoolboy sprinted into the path of her car with arms outstretched 'like Superman'.

Shannon McGarrigle wept as she told an inquest how Sam Belcher, 15, had been running along the side of a road in the village of Pamber Heath, near Tadley, Hampshire, when he dashed in front of her Ford KA.

'He started jogging away from me, he kept turning and looking at me,' Miss McGarrigle, told Alton Magistrates Court.

'He was metres away when he ran out in front of my car with his arms out in front of him, like Superman. He pretty much ran out in front. I went to swerve while he kept jogging.

'I stopped straight away.'

Sam suffered multiple injuries in the accident which happened at around 2.30am just four days before Christmas last year.

Miss McGarrigle told the court she dialled 999 and stayed with Sam until paramedics arrived at the scene, describing the wait as the 'loneliest 10 minutes' of her life.

'I kept talking to him throughout,' she told North Hampshire coroner Andrew Bradley.

"The lady on the phone said 'keep talking to him to see if you can get a response'.

'I don't know whether he was conscious.'

The hearing at Alton Magistrates' Court was told that Sam would have been unconscious from the moment of impact.

Despite the best efforts of paramedics, he was pronounced dead shortly after the collision.

His cause of death was given as severe head injuries.

Police investigators agreed there was nothing that Miss McGarrigle could have done to avoid colliding with Sam as he ran into Silchester Road, less than a mile from his home.

'The driver was confronted with a pedestrian in the road who she was unable to avoid and tragically the pedestrian suffered fatal injuries,' said PC Andrew McDonald.

The inquest heard that Sam had complained of feeling low in the months before his death and had been referred to mental health professionals by both his GP and his school, Hurst Community College in Tadley.

Sam's headteacher, Malcolm Christian, told the hearing that Sam was a 'pleasant pupil, who always appeared bubbly and happy.'

He said that Sam had a good academic record but that his attendance had slipped in the two months before his death.

Mr Christain said that school support staff had flagged up their concerns about Sam and that his mother Claire had also kept him up to date with what the boy was going through - as did Sam himself.

Dr Suzanne Gray, a psychologist, had been working with Sam and his mother and said that while Mrs Belcher had put his low mood down to a prior experience of bullying, the teenager had not agreed.

'Mrs Belcher related it to an experience of bullying but Sam did not equate with that,' she said.

'In the last few months he had an increasingly low mood. He said 'I can't find joy in life any more', and 'I wake up thinking this day is not going to go my way'.'

The inquest heard Sam had come to the end of his sessions with Dr Gray, by mutual consent, and that when he was re-referred to her team in November 2012 he had to join the back of a waiting list and was not seen again prior to his death on December 21.

Mr Bradley said that Sam had sought help and raised concerns that Sam was not seen sooner on his re-referral.

'He's effectively been taken off the conveyor belt and his re-referral puts him back at the beginning of the conveyor belt,' he said.

'I find this incomprehensible and it is certainly something that bears examination because the situation for Sam is clearly one of plummetting downhill and he is not handling whatever is causing him trouble.'

The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide.
