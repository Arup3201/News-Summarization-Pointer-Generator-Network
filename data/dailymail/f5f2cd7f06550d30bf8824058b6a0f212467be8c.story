President Barack Obama today condemned the 'cowardly, evil attack' on a satirical newspaper in France - two years after the White House questioned its judgment for publishing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad.

Speaking from the Oval Office about the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris, Obama said his thoughts were with the people of France, which he called 'America's oldest ally'.

'For us to see the kind of cowardly, evil attacks that took place today, I think reinforces once again why it's so important for us to stand in solidarity with them just as they stand in solidarity with us,' he said.

The paper had been repeatedly threatened for publishing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, and in 2012, the White House roundly criticized the paper for the cartoons.

On September 19, 2012 then-White House Press Secretary Jay Carney slammed the magazine's 'judgment' for publishing the artwork. 

'We are aware that a French magazine published cartoons featuring a figure resembling the Prophet Muhammad, and obviously we have questions about the judgment of publishing something like this,' Carney told reporters at a press briefing.

'We know these images will be deeply offensive to many and have the potential be be inflammatory,' he warned.  

On Wednesday, the president said that he would help France pursue those responsible for the attack on the journalists and, in turn, freedom of the press. 

'The values that we share with the French people, of freedom of expression, is something that can't be silenced because of this senseless violence,' he said. 

He went on: 'We will stand with the people of France during this very, very difficult time.' 

Attack: A victim of the shooting at Charlie Hedbo's offices in Paris on Wednesday is taken to an ambulance

Masked gunmen stormed the office of the satirical weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday and asked for the editor and certain staff members by name before killing them.

The attackers then escaped in a stolen car and remain at large.

Twelve people were killed, in what is France's deadliest terror attack in at least two decades. Footage also apparently shows a police officer being shot in the street as he begs for mercy.

Charlie Hebdo has been repeatedly threatened for its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad and other controversial sketches.

Among the victims were four of France's most revered cartoonists - Stephane Charbonnier, Georges Wolinski, Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac and Jean Cabut - who were behind the images.

Witnesses said the killers were heard shouting 'the Prophet has been avenged' and 'Allahu akbar!' as they stalked the building.

A little more than two years ago, the administration roundly criticized Charlie Hebdo for publishing the cartoons that enraged the Islamists responsible for Wednesday's attack.

On September 19, 2012 then-White House Press Secretary Jay Carney slammed the magazine's 'judgment' for publishing the artwork. 

'We are aware that a French magazine published cartoons featuring a figure resembling the prophet Muhammad, and obviously we have questions about the judgment of publishing something like this,' Carney told reporters at a press briefing.

'We know these images will be deeply offensive to many and have the potential be be inflammatory,' he warned.

The White House did not immediately respond on Wednesday to questions about its about-face in defending the magazine.

Ten people are also believed to have been wounded, four critically, including journalists, administrative staff, and police officers who attended the scene.

President Francois Hollande described the bloodbath as a 'barbaric attack against France and against journalists' and vowed to hunt down those responsible. 

At a press conference on Wednesday morning, House Speaker John Boehner added: 'This vicious terror attack is a reminder that we must always be vigilant against the enemies of freedom.' 

Secretary of State John Kerry said that the U.S. stands with its ally in solidarity and that the U.S. is committed to working with France to confront extremism and promote the cause that extremists fear: Freedom - or 'la liberte'.

Kerry, who has family ties to France, has visited Paris more than any other foreign city as America's top diplomat.

In earlier television interviews, Obama press secretary Josh Earnest also cautioned that the attack was still in the initial stages of investigation.

'We're at the very early stages of what happened and who was responsible,' Earnest said.

He said it is known that there are 'strong ties' between the al Qaeda terrorist network and the Islamic State extremists.

'We obviously are trying to monitor what we consider to be a very important threat,' he said.

'This is an attack on the basic freedoms of freedom of speech and freedom of the press,' he said.

A senior official from the Department of Homeland Security said they are 'closely monitoring' the situation. 

'DHS will not hesitate to adjust our security posture, as appropriate, to protect the American people,' the official said. 

Intelligence agencies are also scrambling to see if they missied warnings of a terrorist attack against France, a senior U.S. official told CNN. But officials have so far found 'nothing that matches'.

The official said they do not believe the attack suggests further attacks against Americans the U.S.

'Our major concern is to quickly identify the individuals involved,' the official said.

On Twitter, the U.S. embassy in France said it has 'no plans to close or limit access' to the embassy or other diplomatic facilities.
