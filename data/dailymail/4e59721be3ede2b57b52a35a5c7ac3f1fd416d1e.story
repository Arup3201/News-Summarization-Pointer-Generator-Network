It’s been almost a year since Google released its Nexus 5, and rumours about the next model have been ramping up in recent weeks.

The latest reports claim the device, dubbed the Nexus 6, has a 5.9-inch screen and will run Android L - the firm’s next-generation operating system.

This would put the device in direct competition with Apple’s phablet 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus.

The latest reports claim the device, dubbed Nexus 6, has a 5.9-inch screen and will run Android L – the firm’s next-generation operating system. Inside the device is rumoured to be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor, which is also found in the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. This should improve battery life

It would also put it on par with Samsung's flagship Galaxy Note 4, which has a 5.7-inch display.

Other rumoured specifications include a 2MP front-facing camera, and camera on the rear that could range between 8MP and 13MP.

Based on last year’s Nexus 5, prices for the Nexus 6 are rumoured to be around the £300 ($400) mark.

At this price, it would make the Nexus 6 more than half the price of the cheapest, SIM-only iPhone 6 Plus, which retails from £619 and from $299 a month on a two-year contract in the US.

By comparison, the Samsung Note 4 costs £629 in the UK, and $825.99 in the US. 

And the Nexus 6 may go on sale as early as 1 November, which would follow suit with the release schedule of its predecessor and release it in time for Christmas.

The Nexus 6 will be Google’s first foray into phablets. It currently sells the smaller 4.95-inch Nexus 5 and the 7-inch Nexus 7 tablet.

Other rumoured specifications include a 2MP front-facing camera, and camera on the rear that could range between 8MP and 13MP. LG and Asus manufactured previous Nexus devices, respectively, but Google is said to have hired Motorola for the next-generation model.

This should increase performance, and improve battery life. Android L is equally said to boost battery life.

Storage-wise, the Nexus 6 is expected to have 16GB and 32GB models, and may extend to a 64GB model.

If the rumours are true, the Nexus 6's 5.9-inch display size would put the device in direct competition with Apple’s 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus (pictured left with the smaller iPhone 5S), and Samsung's 5.7-inch Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (pictured right)
