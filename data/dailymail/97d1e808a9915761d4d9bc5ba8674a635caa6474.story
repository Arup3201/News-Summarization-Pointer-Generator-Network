As England near the end of their one-day series in Sri Lanka, and with the World Cup less than two months away, there remain as many questions as answers. Here are a few – less obvious ones – to be getting on with…

Why does Moeen Ali not face the first ball of the innings?

On the first day of the tour against Sri Lanka A, Alastair Cook played out a maiden at the start of England’s run-chase. In the next over, Moeen Ali hit six fours. A decision should have been made there and then to give Ali first strike. When I asked a member of the dressing-room why this wasn’t happening, he raised his eyebrows as if to consider the question, and replied: ‘Yeah, I don’t know.’

The folly of slowing down the innings almost before it had started was exposed – almost cruelly – during the first one-dayer, when Angelo Mathews twice won lbw shouts against Cook in the first over. Cook successfully challenged both, but England’s policy was being made to look ridiculous. And guess what? It was a maiden.

Moeen Ali should face the first ball for England and be allowed to attack from the start

Why was James Tredwell dropped?

There was at least some logic to leaving out England’s best one-day spinner in Hambantota, and it was backed up by a five-wicket victory. But to omit Tredwell for the next match, on a dry turner at the Premadasa, felt too clever by half.

England said they wanted to have another look at Ben Stokes, as if his rock-bottom confidence was going to stage a miraculous recovery in a single game (in the event, he made six and bowled two overs for 21). They also argued, in private, that Tredwell hadn’t turned it much during the second match, also at the Premadasa.

But, while Sri Lanka’s spinners picked up nine wickets in that fourth game, a Tredwell-less England lacked any sense of threat. What this team needed after pulling one back in Hambantota was to win again and engender some self-belief. Instead, they left out their best spinner on a bunsen.

James Tredwell is England's best ODI spinner and should be in the side, especially on turning tracks

Why was Alex Hales not tried at No 3 from the start?

Alex Hales should be part of England's top three

OK, OK, he should have been opening with Ali, but England weren’t budging on Cook, so first drop was Hales’s only option. 

But the selectors went for Ian Bell, who is their best Test batsman but has never really cracked the one-day malarkey.

By the time the penny dropped, Hales was a man under more pressure than he should have been.

England had discerned various technical ailments during his four one-dayers against India at the end of the summer, whereas most observers reckoned the more salient point was his ability to destroy world-class limited-overs attacks.

He was iffy in Hambantota, then nicked a half-volley first ball at the Premadasa. His part in the run-out of Ali, plus a dropped catch at third man, did little to dispel a suspicion of occasional doziness. But it feels all too English to worry about what might go wrong. 

And Hales will, sometimes, go very, very right. 

Why do England keep bowling wides?

In the warm-up game at the SSC, England sent down 14 wides in 43 overs. Ah, a bit of rust, we thought. They’ll sort it out. They didn’t. The first six one-day internationals produced 64 in wides, compared with 25 from Sri Lanka (by contrast, England have bowled only one no-ball, Sri Lanka five).

Once or twice, the umpires’ interpretation of what constitutes a wide has not always favoured England. But not 64 times. Generally, the malaise has been two-pronged: misdirected bouncers, and leg-side indiscipline. Both should be avoidable.

A list of the miscreants ahead of today’s seventh one-dayer: Woakes 12 wides, Ali 10, Jordan 10, Finn7, Gurney 7, Root 7, Stokes 6, Tredwell 3, Bopara 2.

Why doesn’t Ravi Bopara bowl more?

Going into Tuesday’s final match in Colombo, Bopara was England’s meanest seamer in this series, with an economy-rate of 5.46 (which tells its own story). Yet he had been given 15 overs in six matches, and never more than four in one. Cook plainly doesn’t trust him. Perhaps he should.

What on earth has happened to Eoin Morgan?

If the Morgan who hit 62 in 47 balls during the fourth game turns up at the World Cup, England will have a sniff. If it’s the Morgan who has otherwise scraped together 24 runs in five innings, they are doomed.

There is a theory that Morgan is at his best a) when England are chasing, and he has a goal to aim for, and b) when, batting first, he doesn’t need to rebuild an innings. But these conditions do not always apply.

Morgan says he neglected his own game while the new back-room staff bedded in at the start of the summer, and admits he was out-thought by India’s bowlers at the end. Whatever the reason, his decline has been one of the most alarming aspects of England’s one-day cricket since they returned from Australia.

Why can no one mount a convincing case for the leadership of Cook?

He’s the captain. It can’t be that hard. Paul Downton, the managing director, had a crack on Monday evening, even while admitting the selectors had thought long and hard at the end of the summer about Cook’s presence in the one-day team.

Downton made the best case yet: Cook emerged from the Test win over India as the leader of a dressing-room that was fully behind him, and experienced openers will be needed against two new balls in Australia and New Zealand.

The trouble was, his explanation will continue to lack conviction while Cook is failing and England are losing. The selectors have dug themselves into a hole. Now they’re reduced to crossing their fingers about a way out.

Alastair Cook has had a horror series but England have stuck with him as ODI captain

Whither Ben Stokes?

The buccaneer who slammed 164 for Durham in the semi-final of the Royal London One-Day Cup against Nottinghamshire has lost his way in England colours. Oh my century at Perth and my six-for at Sydney long ago…

Some of this is self-inflicted? He never regained his international equilibrium after breaking a wrist punching a locker in the Caribbean in March. But what exactly is his one-day role for England? No 8 seems too low, while fourth- and fifth-change (which is what he was in his two games here in Sri Lanka) felt like a slap in the face.

Stokes will come again. But he needs a defined role – and a bit of TLC.  

Ben Stokes is low on confidence and doesn't seem to have a defined role in the England side

NIGHTWATCHMAN COMPETITION WINNER

Last week we asked you how many County Championship games Northamptonshire lost by an innings in 2014. As everyone appeared to know, the answer was eight. Yes, eight. But there could be only one winner. Congratulations to Ray Foster of Teddington, who will be receiving a full set of all eight editions of The Nightwatchman, Bloomsbury’s cricket quarterly.

Special bundles of all eight editions of The Nightwatchman can be ordered here - and are guaranteed delivery by Christmas - if they are ordered before midnight tonight" http://www.thenightwatchman.net/news/give-the-gift-of-the-nightwatchman-this-christmas 

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS

To live or die by the sword?

A few days on from India’s heroic failure in Adelaide and this column is still torn. It was great that Virat Kohli urged his men to go down swinging: as a subconscious up-yours to the sterile cynicism of MS Dhoni’s leadership, it was hard not to love.

But once Wriddhiman Saha and Kohli had fallen in quick succession, it didn’t need Dhoni to tell you that the only reasonable option was to go for the draw. And if Dhoni’s return means India revert to their cautious ways abroad, it may all come to nothing anyway.

No escape for Captain Cook

Alastair Cook has repeatedly made a virtue of his absence from social media, where he is not exactly flavour of the month. But the newspaper shoved every morning under the doors of the England team here in Colombo – the hopelessly pro-government Daily News – may be harder to avoid.

According to this morning’s edition, Sri Lanka ‘must continue to go hard at Alastair Cook’s British Lions and make them fly back with greater embarrassment and humiliation by winning the final bash’. Not only that, but Cook’s dropping of Kumar Sangakkara on 41 during the sixth one-dayer in Pallekele was a ‘COOK(up) for England’.

With puns like that, who needs enemies?

Wot no KP?

Monday night and an enjoyable Q&A with some of England’s travelling supporters staying in Negombo, about an hour north of Colombo. These occasions are always fascinating, not least because they provide a sense of what’s bothering the average fan.

And so, in about an hour of chat, with guests encouraged to ask any cricket-related questions they wanted, we discussed James Taylor, England’s death bowling, Cook’s captaincy, Harry Gurney’s yorkers, the World Cup, Eoin Morgan’s struggles and the effect of the Sky TV deal on the sport’s place in British society.

Not once did the subject of Kevin Pietersen crop up. I say this not as evidence that no one cares – plenty do. But we should be careful not to confuse the anger of some with the indifference of others.
