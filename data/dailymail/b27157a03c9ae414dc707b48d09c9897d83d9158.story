Surprised: Shop manager Ali Iqbal, pictured with the black flag - inscribed with a Muslim prayer

The sinister emblem of Islamic State has already brought terror to Syria and Iraq.

So when people saw a suspiciously similar-looking black flag being displayed in Walthamstow, they naturally were worried.

Witnesses who called the police also reported seeing what looked like a gun on the East London premises, a dry cleaner’s shop.

Two officers from the Met investigated, aware that eight years ago a cell of Al Qaeda supporters based nearby were involved in the liquid bomb plot to blow up airliners.

However, their minds were quickly put at rest when manager Ali Iqbal explained that the flag was widely used in the Muslim world and had merely been pinned up to cover a hole in the wall – although his initial assertion that ‘the flag isn’t only used by IS – the Taliban use it as well’ was perhaps less than reassuring.

Mr Iqbal also explained that the ‘gun’ was a BB air gun left over from the shop owner’s market stall.

He was surprised that anyone had linked the flag, which bears the text of one of the central beliefs of Islam, to the IS jihadis bringing death and destruction to Syria and Iraq.

‘I’ve seen this flag before IS was created,’ he said. ‘The Taliban use it as well. And Pakistani tribal religious groups. You even see it on top of mosques or Islamic schools, madrassas. I’ve seen people waving them on TV too.’ 

Mr Iqbal, 30, who is of Pakistani descent but was born in Saudi Arabia and moved to London aged 14, added: ‘I’ve known Abdullah, the shop owner, for the last two years, and the flag’s been up all that time.

‘I don’t think there’s been any complaints until now. Police asked what the flag meant, and I just told them the wording.

‘I think the flag belongs to the Nation of Islam, not IS, but I am happy for it not to be on the wall.’

Proprietor Abdullah Abdur Rehman, who was busy minding his market stall on nearby Walthamstow High Street when the police were called on Wednesday, was also keen to deny supporting IS. 

Mr Rehman, 43, born in South Africa of Pakistani descent but living in London since 2001, said: ‘Somebody gave the flag to me two or three years ago as a gift at the Muslim festival of Eid, and we put it up to cover a hole in the wall.

All clear: Police officers leave after enquiring about the black flag, hanging in the circled area inside the shop in Walthamstow, east London. The shop's manager explained it was widely used in the Muslim world

‘I don’t like IS. And if people think it looks like the flag of terrorists, I have to remove it.’

The Met said: ‘It was found to be a flag that represents one of the five Pillars of Islam. This is not an illegal symbol. The proprietor has removed the flag from public view.’

The black flag mostly commonly used by IS fighters features a line of white text above a white circle which carries black writing.
