London Mayor Boris Johnson has hit out at the 'human rights' group who claimed Britain was to blame for Jihadi John's murderous actions.

He tore into controversial campaigner Asim Qureshi today branding suggestions UK authorities caused the ISIS killer's radicalisation '100% the wrong way up'.

The outspoken mayor then added: 'If you're a human rights group then you should be sticking up for the human rights of those who are being beheaded in Syria and northern Iraq.'

London mayor Boris Johnson today hit back at the group who have blamed the radicalisation of Jihadi John on British security services

Prisoners rights group Cage held a press conference in which they called Mohammed Emwazi - unmasked as Jihadi John last week - 'a beautiful man' who was 'harassed' by British security services.

After widespread condemnation of the group and their comments, the London Mayor took on Qureshi, the group's leader, today.

Qureshi called into Mr Johnson's radio show on London's LBC radio this morning, claiming his defence of Emwazi had been 'unfairly represented'.

But Mr Johnson refused to go back on his previous criticism of the group and slammed Mr Qureshi's claims.

The Tory mayor said: 'I really, really think that the focus of your indignation and outrage should be at people who go out and join groups that throw gays off cliffs, that behead people who don't subscribe to their version of Islam, that glorify in the execution of innocent journalists and aid workers.

'They should be the object of your wrath, not the security services who are trying to keep us safe.'

Families of the victims of ISIS killer Jihadi John (pictured) - unmasked last week as west Londoner Mohammed Emwazi - have also slammed Cage's comments, branding Emwazi 'a monster'

Mr Johnson said the group's claims sent out the completely wrong message, adding: 'If you're going to have an impact on the lives of young Muslims you have to focus on what these people are doing wrong and not instantly scatter blame around.'

But Mr Kureshi refused to change his line and replied: 'What we want is to understand whether or not, the security agencies, their actions led to [Emwasi] feeling that he did not belong to UK society.'

Mr Johnson, who looked furious on a video of the broadcast filmed in the studio, replied: 'I just feel that you've got it 100% the wrong way up. You need to see this thing differently.

'The security services are trying to keep is safe. They cannot conceivably be blamed for their actions trying to prevent people from committing such atrocities.' 

Qureshi's group press conference last week was broadcast live for 52 minutes on the BBC and 58 on Sky News, with Qureshi speaking uninterrupted for 18 minutes.

Mr Johnson is the latest politician to hit out at the perceived apologists for ISIS killers.

In a statement to the Commons yesterday, Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘I condemn anyone who attempts to excuse that barbarism in the way that has been done by Cage.’

The row came after a shocking press conference last week, at which Cage said Jihadi John was 'beautiful'

And Jacqui Smith, a Labour former Home Secretary, added: ‘We can – and should – dismiss the outrageous apologists of Cage who claimed that Emwazi was just a good lad radicalised by the actions of western authorities.’

Families of the victim's of Jihadi John's killing spree have also attacked Cage's defence of the murderer.

Reg Henning, brother of British aid worker Alan Henning who died at the ISIS executioner's hands, said: 'If he's a "beautiful, kind man", why is he killing innocent civilians?

'He's a monster. Everyone should be doing everything they can to capture him and bring him to justice - not stick up for him like he's been hard done by.' 

Qureshi previously urged protestors at a protest outside the US embassy to 'support the jihad of our brothers and sisters' in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and Chechnya'.

Speaking through a microphone at the 2006 pan-Islamic Hizb ut-Tahrir movement rally, he said: 'When we see the example of our brothers and sisters fighting in Chechnya, Iraq, Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan, then we know where the example lies.

Cage's comments last week has sparked a charity commission investigation into organisations, including the Joseph Rowntree trust and Body Shop founder Anita Roddick's Roddick Foundation, who fund the group.

Qureshi appeared at a protest in 2006 at which he said Muslims were being oppressed by the West and called for support for jihad, shouting: 'Allahu Akhbar! Allahu Akhbar!'
