An Air India flight from London was delayed for nearly 12 hours because there were no pilots to fly the Boeing 787 Dreamliner back to New Delhi, according to reports.

The twin-engine airliner landed at Heathrow Airport on Tuesday evening after a nine-hour journey and was scheduled to return to the Indian capital the same night.

But the departure did not take place because the airline ‘had not positioned any pilots in London’ to operate the aircraft's return leg, the Times of India reported, quoting an unnamed source.

The return leg was delayed because Air India 'had not positioned any pilots in London', reports suggest

The flight crew who flew the Dreamliner to Heathrow from New Delhi were unable to operate the return leg because they had reached their maximum flight time and were required to take a mandatory rest period.

With no one available to fly the plane the debt-ridden airline was forced to park the aircraft at Heathrow and pay for hotel rooms near Heathrow for about 200 passengers.

Following their mandatory rest the pilots who flew the plane to London were behind the controls for the return flight, which departed Wednesday morning, the Times of India reported.

Air India says blamed the mix-up on delays in Mumbai, which 'led to a lot of changes in crew movement'

An Air India spokesperson told the newspaper: ‘Air India had operated B-777 aircraft on January 3, 4 and 5 to London in order to clear the holiday rush.

‘Thereafter, from January 6, the aircraft was reverted to B-787 and the crew was scheduled accordingly.

‘However, due to fog in Delhi, one of the flights was diverted to Mumbai, which led to lot of changes in crew movement.

‘After giving the pilots minimum applicable rest and keeping in view the night curfew in London, the flight was rescheduled to January 7 at 4am. Air India regrets inconvenience to passengers.’
