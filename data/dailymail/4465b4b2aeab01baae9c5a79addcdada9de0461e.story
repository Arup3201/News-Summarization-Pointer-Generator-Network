What an explosive start to the week. Andre Villas-Boas has been axed by Tottenham and Manchester City will take on Barcelona in the Champions League.

Tottenham are searching for a new manager after parting ways with the Portugues coach following Sunday's humiliating 5-0 defeat by Liverpool at White Hart Lane.

Villas-Boas lost his best player Gareth Bale in the summer with the club spending over £110million on reinforcements.

So were Spurs right to get rid of him before Christmas or did he deserve more time to put things right?

No laughing matter: Andre Villas-Boas and Steve Clarke have been sacked by Tottenham and West Brom, respectively

And Villas-Boas was not the only manager to lose his job. Steve Clarke was sacked by West Bromwich Albion following their loss against Cardiff. Were the Baggies right to axe him?

The Champions League draw, meanwhile, has thrown 
up a host of mouthwatering fixtures. Didier Drogba faces an emotional 
return to Chelsea with Roberto Mancini's Galatasaray taking on Jose 
Mourinho's men in the last 16.

Manchester City will have to stop the
likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Co as they prepare to face the mighty
Barcelona for place in the quarter finals.
