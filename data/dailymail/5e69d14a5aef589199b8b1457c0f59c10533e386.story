A high school football player in Arizona died yesterday, from a brain injury sustained in the fourth quarter of a blowout playoff game loss.

Hopi High School senior Charles Youvella died of a traumatic brain injury while in hospital, the Arizona Interscholastic Association said.

He was injured on Saturday in Hopi's 60-6 loss to Arizona Lutheran, in a first-round playoff game.

Youvella scored his team's only touchdown in the game. He was described as '5'5'' and 115lbs ringing wet, but he played 10 times that size', the school's coach Steve Saban told 12 News in Phoenix.

The death has attracted national attention after Arizona Cardinals star wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald tweeted a picture of Youvella and asked people to pray for the teen's family, friends and teammates.

A community memorial is planned for Wednesday evening at the high school auditorium.

The Arizona Interscholastic Association says Charles Youvella died with his family by his side.

Youvella's father, Wallace Youvella Jr., is the school's athletic director.

'We'll all have to move forward and at least support one another and support our young children,' Hopi Chairman Le Roy Shingoitewa said.

The death comes at a time when head injuries in football are attracting attention at all levels of the sport.

The Institute of Medicine and National Research Council two weeks ago called for a national system to track sports-related concussions and answer questions about youth concussions.

The report said 250,000 people aged 19 and younger were treated in emergency rooms for concussions and other sports- or recreation-related brain injuries in the country in 2009.

That was an increase from 150,000 in 2001.

The Arizona Interscholastic Association says an account will be established to help defray costs for the Youvella family.

Hopi High School is in the community of Keams Canyon, on the Hopi reservation in northeastern Arizona.
