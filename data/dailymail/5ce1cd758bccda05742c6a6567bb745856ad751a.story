England will kick off Saturday's game knowing precisely what they need to do to win the Six Nations and take huge momentum into the World Cup.

They had a similar chance a year ago — although they didn’t play last — but blew it badly in Rome.

The common language of coaches in this position is ‘let’s win the game first,’ but that is nonsense. This is not about beating France, it is about winning the title.

They need a clear game plan to maximise points difference. Nobody remembers who comes second.

It is tempting to think England must throw caution to the wind and play a wild, attacking game. But if they get ahead of themselves and try to run up a big score early they could come horribly unstuck.

This is not a bad French team — in fact I have never really seen a bad French team as they do have so much talent available. They don’t look comfortable on or off the field but the French have a habit of performing under pressure and they’re capable of beating England.

Throughout this week, I would have gone through match scenarios with my captain, the scrum-halves and the fly-halves, discussing what decision we’d make depending on how many points we need in the match. That would then be presented to the whole team so everyone is on message.

Lancaster must make it clear to his players exactly what they need to do to win the title

If England need a big score, Chris Robshaw and the half-backs will face big decisions from the first minute. I hope Stuart Lancaster has made it clear to the players this week exactly how the day will pan out in terms of timings.

As soon as the early games finish, the results should be up on the changing-room wall. The amount of points they need to win by should be printed in big, bold type. This is the day for real detail and no surprises, and finding out which players can really perform under pressure.

England should be very pleased with the situation they find themselves in, especially after the hiding they received in Dublin. With the games falling as they do, I wouldn’t set out any directives for the team about watching them or not — it should be every individual’s decision. Personally, I would like to watch as much as possible; if nothing else, it takes your mind off our game for a few minutes. Some of the players may want to watch the Wales v Italy game while others won’t.

They’ll be warming up while the Scotland v Ireland game is being played so there’s no question of them watching that, but I’d let the players know I would be putting the score from the Ireland game up on the board in the changing room at 4.30pm so they know precisely what’s required of them. That can be broken down into six very clear areas.

1 Build the score

It sounds easy, but it’s critical. France are more susceptible than any international side if they are put under pressure and they have lost on their last three visits to Twickenham.

The best way to create pressure is to lead throughout. So England must try to ensure they take the lead early and force France to chase the game. They must take every penalty that is offered — if the referee, say, gives an advantage, decline it and take the points. Take three points from drop-goal opportunities — never leave their 22 without points.

This game is crying out for three drop goals in the first 20 minutes, even if you don’t score tries until later in the game. If opportunities arise, we must take them, something we failed to do against Scotland.

2 Maintain discipline

England must be squeaky clean and aim to concede no more than four penalties in each half. The contact area and scrum will be key and England cannot afford to gift France easy points.

Scrum-half Ben Youngs needs to establish a running dialogue with referee Nigel Owens and England must not allow France to have the ball at the breakdown. Yellow or red cards must be seen as a total disaster, and every player must take full responsibility to control himself in every aspect of the game.

3 Keep the ball in play

The speed of the ball and the speed and variety of the restarts are absolutely critical. I want to see quick, pre-called line-outs and the ball in and out of the scrum quickly to avoid the risk of giving penalties away at the back of it.

If the line-out isn’t secure, there’s nothing wrong with taking the tap penalty. Keep the tempo up because this massive French side will not want to be moved around.

George Ford passes the ball and England must keep the ball in play as much as possible

Also, to score maximum points, you need the ball in play for the maximum amount of time. Every time the ball’s out of play, it is not only time but points ticking away.

England must also employ an exciting restart policy. Every kick-off must be done with the aim of getting the ball back. We need variety so we can kick left, right or down the middle but we must get it back.

4 Kick well, chase hard

This is a huge test of England’s tactical kicking game, which I’m not sure is as good as it needs to be yet. In the 2003 World Cup semi-final, I picked Mike Catt at No 12 ahead of Mike Tindall because he had a superior kicking game. France will believe they can get at George Ford so Mike Brown needs to support his kicking game.

Mike Brown needs to support Ford's kicking game and limit the up-and-unders

I’d limit the up-and-unders and box kicks, too, as they are too much of a lottery. Ford, Youngs and Brown need to look deep and hit the green stuff. Field position gave Jonny Wilkinson the opportunity to get three drop goals as England won that semi 24-7 against a French team who were favourites to beat us.

5 Half-Time

The message needs to be that this is now a game of 40 minutes. You can’t change what’s happened in the first half but you can learn.

They’ll know exactly what is needed and the team and tactics can change if needs be. The bench can then be used to identify areas of French weakness and attack them.

England must make sure the second half is played as a game of 40 minutes

Understand, France are currently the best defensive team in the tournament, having only conceded two tries. Patience will be a key word, but tries will come as long as we are playing the game at real pace.

6 Keep your best men on

Matches are won in the last 30 minutes, not the first 30, and I’d always look to have my strongest side on the field at the end of the game. The key is not to bring any player on unless he is going to improve the team. I still believe Danny Cipriani can be a trump card. Will Lancaster dare opt for a Ford-Cipriani-Joseph combination if the game calls for it? You can score two tries in the last five minutes; it only takes 20 seconds to score.

I’d expect England to win — then it becomes about by how much. I just feel this French side is better than everyone is giving them credit for, and I’m very surprised Lancaster has not picked a specialist second-row on the bench. It’s a massive gamble as Courtney Lawes and Geoff Parling have a history of injuries, potentially leaving Nick Easter to play the majority of the match out of position in the second row.

This is a hugely exciting day of rugby. People have questioned the staggered kick-off times but for me it makes the day unbelievably exciting and is brilliant for fans watching at home.

It is a massive day for Lancaster and his team. They need this championship more than the others. They can’t afford another bad day at the office.
