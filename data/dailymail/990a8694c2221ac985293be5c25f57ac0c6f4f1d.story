An innocent commuter was strangled with a scarf until he passed out by a fellow bus passenger in an unprovoked attack.

CCTV footage released by police shows a man using his scarf to choke the 37-year-old victim, who was making his way to work in the Earls Court area of London.

It shows the passenger, who police say has been left 'highly traumatised' by the incident, losing consciousness briefly before coming around, at which point the suspect can be seen trying to strangle him once again.

Unprovoked: The man, seen wearing a hat and sitting behind the victim, was captured on camera removing his scarf

Violent: The suspect then launched at the commuter sitting in front of him, wrapping the scarf around his neck and strangling him

The assault took place as the commuter was en route to work on a single decker C1 bus in broad daylight in London at around 1.50pm on Saturday afternoon.

CCTV footage released by the Met Police shows the attacker boarding the bus, which was travelling to White City, at Cresswell Gardens and sitting down immediately behind the victim.

It shows the pair exchanging words briefly, before the suspect launches at his fellow passenger from behind, choking him with a scarf until he passes out.

When the victim regained consciousness a few seconds later, the assailant again tried to strangle him. In all the attack lasted around 30 seconds.

Attacker: The suspect, who got off the bus at Shepherds Bush, is described as a black male in his early to mid 20s

After being assisted by passengers, the victim got off the bus at Earls Court and told nearby police officers what had happened.

The suspect, a black male believed to be in his early to mid 20s, was captured on camera getting off the bus at Shepherds Bush at 1.57pm.

He was wearing a grey beanie hat, a sleeveless puffa-style jacket over a beige sweatshirt, dark jeans and boots.

Detective Constable Thomas Norman, of Notting Hill CID, said: 'This was an unprovoked attack on an innocent passenger who was on his way to work.

'The victim has been left highly traumatised. It was so violent that he passed out and this could have been far worse.

'I would urge anyone with information or anyone who recognises this man to contact us as soon as possible. This man is a danger to the public.'

Anyone with information can contact Notting Hill CID on 0208 246 0217, the non-emergency police line on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
