The ease with which traders at Royal Bank of Scotland rigged interest rates has been laid bare in a series of damning emails.

As the state-backed bank was yesterday fined £390million for its part in the Libor scandal, financial regulators released some of the swaggering messages swapped by its traders.

In messages littered with spelling mistakes, the RBS traders joked about manipulating rates up and down.

Royal Bank of Scotland must almost £400million to US and UK regulators for its part in the Libor-rate fixing scandal

A message from one said: ‘can we lower our fixings today please?’.

He was told: ‘make your mind up, haha, yes no probs’. The trader then replied: ‘I’m like a whores drawers’.

Another trader boasted: ‘its (sic) amazing how much libor fixing can make you that much money’.

The behaviour – described as ‘truly 
outrageous’ – went on between January 2006 and November 2010, even 
continuing after the bank received a £45billion taxpayer bailout during 
the financial crisis.

Revelations that Libor had been 
repeatedly manipulated by traders stunned the banking world last year 
and led to the exit of Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond.

Now damning evidence showed how 
traders at RBS in London were also part of a global conspiracy to 
manipulate rates. Libor is the key interbank lending rate, used to 
determine the mortgage and savings rate, and is linked to trillions of 
pounds of investments around the world.

Indicating how endemic the scandal 
was, the Financial Services Authority said RBS effectively encouraged 
rate-rigging, sitting traders next to colleagues responsible for 
submitting interest rates.

Chancellor George Osborne condemned the 'totally unacceptable' behaviour at RBS as Business Secretary Vince Cable called for a return to traditional values in banks

Last night Chancellor George Osborne 
promised those responsible would face the ‘full force of the law’. RBS 
chief executive Stephen Hester said he was ‘disgusted’, adding: ‘What is
profoundly depressing is this is an extreme example of the selfish and 
self-serving culture that the whole industry has been tagged with since 
the financial crisis.’

But he refused to resign or hand back a £1.5million bonus from 2010, despite taking the helm in November 2008.

RBS was hit with £300million in fines 
from the US Department of Justice and the Commodities Futures Trading 
Commission and an £87.5million fine from the FSA. It dwarfs the 
£290million fine slapped on Barclays last summer.

Swiss bank UBS was hit with a £940million penalty in December.  

Six of the 21 workers found guilty of 
wrongdoing are still working at the bank, although some are still 
awaiting disciplinary action. Just six had been sacked for misconduct, 
including two managers, while the remaining culprits quit before any 
action could be taken.

RBS also faces the prospect of criminal sanctions in the US.

Evidence of the 'truly outrageous' behaviour at RBS emerged after Business Secretary called for a return to traditional values at banks in a speech yesterday.
