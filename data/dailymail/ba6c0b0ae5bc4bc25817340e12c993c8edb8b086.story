Prime Minister David Cameron has been photographed leaving a performance of a controversial and hugely popular West End musical.

Book of Mormon is written by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with Robert Lopez, and is about two missionaries who are sent out to spread the word of Mormonism in Uganda.

Directed by Casey Nicholaw, it has enjoyed a hugely successful run in the United States and around Â£7.8million worth of tickets were sold ahead of the opening at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London.

The musical is a religious satire on Mormonism, also known as the Church of Latter-Day Saints, with songs like 'Making Things Up Again' and 'All-American Prophet', as well as containing a character called 'F*** Frog' and one scene with a singing clitoris.

It garnered both praise from critics and an impressive haul of theatre awards in the U.S., including numerous Tony Awards and a Grammy.

Nobody at the London Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was available for comment.

It is not known what the PM thought of The Book of Mormon, a satirical Broadway musical

The church released an official response to the musical, stating: 'The production may attempt to entertain audiences for an evening, but the Book of Mormon as a volume of scripture will change people's lives forever by bringing them closer to Christ.'

Matt Stone, one of the show's creators, described The Book of Mormon as 'an atheist's love letter to religion'.

Earlier in the day the Prime Minister was at the EU summit in Brussels.
