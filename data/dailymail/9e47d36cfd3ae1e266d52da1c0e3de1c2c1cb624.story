Japan last night became the first major economy to abandon the greenhouse-gas promises made in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.

In a setback for the UN talks on climate change this week in Warsaw, Tokyo announced it will let emissions rise 3 per cent above 1990 levels by 2020.

Tokyo’s announcement came as David Cameron said there was growing evidence that climate change caused extreme weather such as the Philippines typhoon. He said politicians should listen to scientists who say man is to blame and take ‘preventative steps’.

UN delegates have warned that plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions globally and reduce climate change could be threatened by Japan's decision to scale back its emissions target (file picture)

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said 
Japan’s decision was ‘deeply disappointing’ and a ‘major step 
backwards’.

However some Tory MPs called for the UK to follow Tokyo’s 
lead. Japan, which hosted the Kyoto Protocol, had promised to cut 
emissions by 25 per cent.

But the fifth biggest producer of greenhouse 
gases said the original targets could not be met following the decision 
to mothball its nuclear plants after the Fukushima disaster in 2011.

The country’s chief government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said the 2020 target of a 25 per cent cut was ‘completely baseless’.

The loss of a quarter of its power production leaves Japan more reliant on high-polluting coal and gas.

It
insists the change to the target is temporary, while it resolves its 
energy supply issues, and it still intends to halve emissions by 2050.

Britain,
which derives about 20 per cent of its energy from nuclear, is on track
to cut carbon emissions by 34 per cent by 2020 compared with 1990 
levels. It has a legally binding target to cut them by 80 per cent by 
2050.

Mr Davey said: ‘It is deeply disappointing that the Japanese 
government has taken this decision to significantly revise down its 2020
emissions target.

'This is inconsistent with the unequivocal message 
from the scientific evidence, which clearly underlines the urgency of 
addressing emissions reductions.’

Britain has committed to build a 
new generation of nuclear power stations, which will help cut emissions;
the first deal was signed for a reactor at Hinkley Point in Somerset 
last month.

But they will take years to produce power and Tory MPs are 
concerned that meeting climate targets with green taxes on homes and 
businesses, and building expensive wind farms, will harm economic 
growth.

Mr Cameron has already promised to ‘roll back’ green taxes on 
household bills this year - although they are expected to be put into 
general taxation instead.

Peter Lilley, a Tory MP and former trade 
minister who sits on the Commons energy and climate change committee, 
said: ‘This is part of a pattern. We have seen Canada resile from its 
climate targets, Australia abandoning green taxes, now Japan, and I 
think we will see something similar in Germany which is clearly going to
be unable to reach its ambitions for the same reason as the Japanese.

The climate talks are taking place in Warsaw, Poland, pictured. European Union delegates 'expressed disappointment' at the new figure, while UN climate chief Christiana Figueres said there was 'regret' over Japan's decision

'You
cannot say it makes any sense for Britain... to continue trying to 
set an example by crippling our industry with high costs and our 
customers with unbearable bills. Unilateral energy disarmament can only 
handicap us.'

Mr Cameron’s comments, made on his trip to the 
Commonwealth conference in Sri Lanka, will anger some Tory backbenchers,
a growing number of whom question the link between man’s actions and 
global warming.

Influential grandee Lord Lawson said this week that 
it was ‘a scare’ to suggest that Typhoon Haiyan, which is thought to 
have killed up to 10,000 people in the city of Tacloban alone, is linked
to climate change.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has also accused environmentalists of getting ‘emotional’ about global warming.

Mr
Cameron said governments should act even if there was a 40 per cent 
chance that climate change had nothing to do with extreme weather.

He
added: ‘I’ll leave the scientists to speak for themselves about the 
link between severe weather events and climate change. The evidence 
seems to me to be growing.'
