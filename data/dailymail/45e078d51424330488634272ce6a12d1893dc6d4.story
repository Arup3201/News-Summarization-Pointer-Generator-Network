A man ended up in hospital after jumping into a hot spring on the northern Nevada desert to rescue a dog.

Gerlach volunteer fire chief Willard Gooch said the man was scalded by water in the Double Hot Springs on the Black Rock Desert, about 120 miles north of Reno.

He added that the man was flown by medical helicopter to a Reno hospital, where his condition was not immediately released.

The Double Hot Springs in Black Rock Desert reach about 180 degrees with very steep and slippery banks

'There's three (hot springs) that's out there that you can get pretty burned from,' Mr Gooch told the Reno Gazette-Journal. 'There are several out there that people need to pay attention to.' 

The hot springs at Black Rock Desert can be streams or deep ponds of boiling water, he added. The Double Hot Springs reach about 180 degrees with very steep and slippery banks.

Although the area around the springs is fenced, dogs have been known to jump into or drink from them.

Mr Gooch told the paper that he has seen at least six cases in recent years of people jumping into the hot springs at Black Rock Desert trying to save an animal.

In 2000, a 27-year-old Reno woman and a friend were walking near the Double Hot Springs when their dogs leaped into one of the pools.

They tried to rescue the animals and ended up getting severely burned themselves.

The woman died from her burns and her friend suffered second- and third-degree burns over 80 percent of his body.

Both dogs had to be euthanized.

The status of the dog in the latest accident was not immediately known.

'With this being an open bird season, a lot of people are out here with their hunting dogs,' Mr Gooch said. 'That's what's scary is that people don't really know how fast it all happens.'

Mr Gooch said he's taken his water-loving hunting dog to Black Rock Desert, but he added that it is important that pet owners take the right precautions.

'Keep your dogs in the vehicle until you look around the area to see where the hot springs are before you let them out,' he said. 

'I just suggest people to really be cautions when they let their dogs out near hot springs, especially if they love water.'

Many visitors simply do not pay attention to where the springs are, he said.

'Some of those springs reach 180 degrees,' Mr Gooch said. 'That's how hot a lot of these springs are here. I wish people would understand how hot they are.'

'It happens quite often, more often than it should,' he said.
