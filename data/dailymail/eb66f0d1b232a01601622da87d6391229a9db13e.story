'You looked so beautiful and as I wiped away my own few tears, I knew it was right,' Mr Birrell said in his tribute

Ms Birrell had married her husband Tom in a surprise ceremony at their engagement party in December last year, reflecting the adventurous and passionate that her illness could never take from her.

Mr Birrell said in his tribute to his beloved wife, who he met at his parents cafe, that their wedding was 'perfect' and that Ms Birrell was 'so beautiful'.

'When you were walking across from the house, I was thinking to myself "Could this get any better?" Yes. and it did,’'he said.

'You looked so beautiful and as I wiped away my own few tears, I knew it was right.'

'It couldn’t have been more perfect. It was the best day of my life.'

Diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder affecting the lungs and digestive system, at just six weeks old, Ms Birrell knew what is was like to fight for the life she loved.

Before her health deteriorated rapidly two years ago, she was studying to become a paramedic, and had work hard towards becoming a talented dancer, fulfilling a dream to dance in the Rio Carnival, reported the Sunshine Coast Daily.

Ms Birrell's mother-in-law took to social media to express her grief at the loss of her son's wife, describing her as a fighter and praising her for her strength and courage.

Michelle Birrell wrote, 'She has fought valiantly for the last 25 years against Cystic Fibrosis, determining in her heart that it would never define her life,' the Sunshine Coast Daily reported.

'She has travelled the world, she loved to dance and she lived life with passion.'

Mrs Birrell said that her son and daughter-in-law never lost hope and clung to their strong Christian beliefs throughout their ordeal.

Friends posted tributes on her Facebook page attesting to her love for life and her unquenchable curiosity about the world around her.

In the past few years Ms Birrell had traveled to 44 countries, chasing her dreams and making the most of every opportunity presented to her.

One friend wrote, 'This girl, even in her darkest days never gave up fighting,' while another posted that she had learnt about joy 'in the midst of strife'.

'We learnt to treasure every single moment that we have with those that we love,' she wrote. 

One of her friends wrote in a blog post that Kari-Lee was 'in better hands and flying safely with the angels...I hope one day soon we can find comfort knowing the pain of her illness no longer constricts her.' 

Her husband Tom Birrell said that despite prayer for a miracle to heal his wife, she became the miracle instead.

'In a way she was the miracle,' he said.

'She changed all of our lives.'

A crowdfunding page has been set up to help Ms Birrell's husband in the wake of her death.
