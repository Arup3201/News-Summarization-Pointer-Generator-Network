Prime Minister David Cameron took a leaf out of macho President Putin's adventurous book when he accompanied the Russian leader on a helicopter flight.

Although Mr Cameron might be more likely to be seen on planes, trains and automobiles - helicopter travel is positively pedestrian for his new Presidential pal, who has previously been pictured riding bare-chested on horse back, in a race car, and in a motorised hand glider.

The pair chose to travel by chopper as 
they surveyed the site of the Sochi Olympic Park, where the 2014 winter 
games will be held.

New partnership: The helicopter ride came as it was announced that British and Russian security services would work together for the Winter Olympics

The upcoming sporting event will mark
the first time that British and Russian security services will have 
worked together since the death of former KGB agent Alexander 
Litvinenko, seven years ago.

The announcement of the new partnership came after Mr Putin took Mr Cameron on a helicopter ride high above the site of the next Winter Olympics - in a stunt to end the formerly frosty relations between their two countries.

Following more than three hours of talks at Mr Putin's summer retreat on the Black Sea, Mr Cameron agreed that there would be ‘limited cooperation between 
our security forces’ as Russia prepares to host the Games.

Britain had imposed a ban on secret service co-operation since Russia’s 
refusal to extradite the main suspect in Litvinenko’s polonium poisoning
in London in 2006, MP Andrey Lugovoy, to face murder changes.

However, animosity has since thawed, and Mr 
Cameron has agreed that people in both countries are ‘safer and better 
off’ through more engagement between London and Moscow.

While
Mr Cameron has tried to carefully cultivate a 'man of the people', and 
family-friendly image, his new Russian ally has long painted himself as 
an adventure-loving sex-symbol, oozing machismo.

Action man: Vladimir Putin is often pictured partaking in various sporting activities - often topless - such as horse riding in southern Siberia's Tuva region

Animal lover: Putin flew a hang-glider following his 2012 election win to shepherd a flock of cranes on their migratory route

He
was famously pictured in 2007 while on holiday in southern Siberia's 
Tuva region swimming, hunting and fishing with no shirt on to show off 
his masculine physique.

He 
is also a keen jodu player and has been photographed flying helicopters,
driving formula 1 racing cars and shooting guns on a regular basis.

And following his 2012 re-election, he even flew a hang-glider to shepherd a flock of cranes on their migratory route.
