The Leveson Inquiry is set to cost taxpayers nearly £6 million.

The press standards probe has already spent £3.2 million since it was set up in July last year.

Figures released to Parliament suggest the final cost is likely to be around £5.6 million.

'A lot of money': Lord Leveson speaking last July during the early stages of the press standards inquiry, which is expected to cost taxpayers around £5.6million, latest figures have revealed

Legal sources have suggested that the inquiry's lead barrister Robert Jay could pocket more than £500,000 for his work grilling politicians, journalists and celebrities.

The soaring cost has led to fresh questions about David Cameron's decision to set up the inquiry in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.

Philip Davies, a Tory member of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said most members of the public could not understand the point of the inquiry.

Mr Davies said: 'We are spending a lot of money feathering the nests of lawyers in order to find out what we already know and, potentially, to end up with a form of statutory regulation of the media that will be a disaster for free speech.

'All we have learned is the blindingly obvious - that journalists and politicians have close working relationships.

'I don’t think people are lying awake 
at night wondering what text messages Rebekah Brooks has sent the Prime 
Minister. We need to get back to focusing on real people’s concerns, 
such as jobs, bills, crime and immigration.'

Details
of the costs were revealed to Parliament by Culture Secretary Jeremy 
Hunt, who has himself given evidence to the inquiry.

Mr
Hunt said: 'The cost of the Leveson Inquiry to the public purse to date
is about £3.2 million, which represents payments made.

'The
total cost for part one of the Leveson Inquiry from start-up in July 
2011 is currently projected to be about £5.6 million.'

Part one of the inquiry is expected to report later this year on the future of the press.

Lord Justice Leveson has himself 
raised question marks over whether part two of the inquiry, due to look 
at unlawful activity at the News of the World after court proceedings 
have finished, should ever go ahead - partly on cost grounds.

‘That
inquiry will involve yet more enormous cost, both to the public purse 
and the participants,’ he said. ‘It will trawl over material then more 
years out of date and is likely to take longer than the present 
inquiry.’

If the second 
phase of the inquiry is abandoned it would mean that the issue of phone 
hacking at the News of the World, which sparked public outrage, will 
never be fully examined.

The Leveson Inquiry website's most recent entry, for expenditure to the end of January 2012, revealed spending of £536,100 on counsel to the inquiry, and £682,100 on the inquiry’s secretariat.

That suggests lead counsel Robert Jay can expect to pocket a hefty six-figure sum once the inquiry is concluded.

One legal source last night said Mr Jay would pocket more than £500,000, with his assisting barristers each taking £80,000.

Costs for the hearing room, annexe and office accommodation had run to £121,200 by January.

The Leveson Inquiry has dominated politics in recent days, with David Cameron, George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband all giving evidence, along with former Prime Ministers Gordon Brown and Sir John Major.

The inquiry will hold no public hearings next week. The next phase of the inquiry is expected to focus on evidence from political journalists.
