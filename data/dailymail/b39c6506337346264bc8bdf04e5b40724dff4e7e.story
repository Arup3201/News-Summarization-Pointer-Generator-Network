It was the Champions League against the Championship. A striker currently spearheading the favourites to win Europe’s elite club tournament against a central defence drawn from England’s second tier.

Their respective profiles and earning power would suggest only one winner. But there are still some things that Robert Lewandowski’s reputed £150,000-a-week salary at Bayern Munich can’t buy. A goal against Scotland is one of them.

Russell Martin and Gordon Greer, of Norwich City and Brighton and Hove Albion respectively, looked this superstar striker in the eye and vowed they would not let him score.

They were as good as that intention demanded. Yet keeping Lewandowski under wraps came at a price elsewhere. The thumping equaliser netted by Arkadiusz Milik was a painful blow given how well Scotland had done to recover from losing a sloppy opening goal.

Perhaps, though, any sense of disappointment at only drawing away to a team who had just sunk the world champions is a sign of how far Gordon Strachan’s side have come. This could yet prove to be a vital point on the long and winding road towards Euro 2016.

Lewandowski had set up the clinching second goal in Poland’s historic win over Germany on Saturday, but was mainly reduced to a frustrated figure as Tuesday night’s match unfolded.

Time and again, Martin and Greer denied him space or forced him out of the danger zone. Only once did he manage to unleash his formidable power on David Marshall’s goal. It was met with a superb flying save from the Cardiff City goalkeeper.

Yes, Scotland lack a global name to compare with Lewandowski but this was further evidence of how far a genuine team unit might take us.

What a stage this was for Greer to make his competitive debut for Scotland after four friendly outings. Two months short of his 34th birthday, only Celtic great Ronnie Simpson has entered international football at such an advanced age.

Having precious qualification points at stake may have been a new experience for Greer but, oddly enough, playing in this stadium wasn’t. He was part of the team that recorded a 1-0 friendly win here in March.

Alongside him stood Martin, who has become one of the first names on Strachan’s team-sheet in recent months. Like Greer, the door to his progression was opened by injuries to colleagues. A starring role in the remarkable 1-0 win over Croatia in June of last year confirmed his capability to be an effective international performer.

Neither was overawed by what they encountered in the Stadion Naradowy, a ground which is one of the most impressive in European football. Constructed for the Euro 2012 finals, four giant television screens hang from a central column its retractable roof. They featured the face of former Motherwell defender Tom Hateley in the countdown to kick off. Now with Slask Wroclaw, the full-back warned his adopted homeland not to expect old-fashioned route-one football from Strachan’s side.

One thing the locals do not need a lesson in is how to sing a national anthem. The ground reverberated to the noise of Mazurek Dabrowskiego as plastic banners turned the stands into one giant Poland flag.

The euphoria that filled this place after a first-ever victory over Germany was still lingering some 72 hours on.

Dampening that rampant positivity and injecting some doubt had to be the early aim. Instead Alan Hutton arrived with a gift for Krzysztof Maczynski to fire Poland into an 11th minute lead via David Marshall’s left-hand post.

It was a sign of Scotland’s confidence, however, that the recovery was both prompt and effective. Seven minutes was all it took for a fine move to end with Shaun Maloney placing the ball beyond Wojciech Szczesny.

Around the first half flurries, the battle to contain Lewandowski was unfolding. Martin won the first direct duel with a thumping challenge near the touchline that rebounded off the Pole to bring a Scotland throw.

It set the tone for the opening period as Strachan’s defence worked tirelessly to deny the 26-year-old space.

Greer tested his fortitude with a crunching block on an attempted shot from 25 yards out. Lewandowski writhed in the ground in pain and continued chirping in the direction of Spanish referee Alberto Mallenco. If Greer’s intention was lay down a marker, to remind his illustrious opponent that he would not be cowed by reputation, then it seemed to have the desired effect.

To help Martin and Greer in their quest, Strachan had opted to drop Andrew Robertson in favour of the superior physique provided by Steven Whittaker. There was no doubt the Poles were a powerful side and Whittaker’s selection was justified by one moment late in the first half.

It looked for all the vodka in Warsaw that Lewandowski would score after Waldemar Sobota got in behind Hutton and delivered a ball that eliminated the centre-backs. Whittaker, though, stole in from the striker’s blind side with a terrific covering challenge that rescued the situation.

Greer had been keeping things simple and steady in most of his work but allowed one pass to carelessly bobble him. Lewandowski was onto it in a flash but, just as he turned to home in on goal, he found Martin blocking his path. No-one could complain about the communication between the Championship pairing over the first 45 minutes.

There were times in the second period when it was more fraught, despite Steven Naismith putting Scotland in front.

The Bayern man was an inch or two away on getting his toe on the end a cross from the excellent Milik, before Marshall was finally required to deny him in impressive style.

Lewandowski will now return to Bavaria with the club game’s greatest prizes in his sights. The aims of Martin and Greer are more modest, but on Tuesday night they were all equals.
