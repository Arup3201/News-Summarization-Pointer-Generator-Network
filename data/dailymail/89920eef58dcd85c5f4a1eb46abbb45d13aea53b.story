Four Kurdish fighters were buried in a makeshift cemetery today in the latest tragedy to have come out of Kobane since ISIS fighters waged an unrelenting attack on the border town. 

They were laid to rest by hordes of mourners in Suruc, Turkey, their ages emblazoned in red paint on rickety tombstones.

Members of the YPG, the People's Protection Unit, they had been fighting tirelessly against the extremist group as it struggles to take hold of the border town.

Hundreds of mourners carried the coffins of three Kurdish fighters into a makeshift cemetery today in the border town of Kobane as the conflict against ISIS continues

Their corpses now lie alongside 27 others who have perished in the conflict this month. 

ISIS holds part of the town but has been forced to retreat following persistent clashes with Kurdish forces in recent weeks. Their efforts have also been thwarted by sustained airstrikes by American and Arab forces. 

Today mourners wept as men carried wooden coffins through sandy streets and lowered them into shallow graves.

The Kurdish flag was draped over each of their coffins, with mourners gesturing for peace as they carried them into the site. 

Earlier this week a young woman and two men were buried in the same cemetery after perishing in the battle for Kobane which began almost a month ago. 

Since the outbreak of war in Syria, more than 1million refugees are thought to have crossed the border into Turkey seeking safety.

With so many civilians displaced, it is almost impossible to locate the family of each fighter who has died in the ongoing conflicts. 

Strangers carried the coffin of one woman to her grave in Suruc this week after being unable to contact her loved ones. Though they did not know the deceased, they wept for her sacrifice as they lowered her body into the ground. 

Only five of the thirty graves dug in the cemetery belong to fighters whose families have been found, it was reported. 

Tensions on the border town have flared in recent weeks with a series of American and Arab airstrikes obliterating the black ISIS flag once positioned on top of a hillside earlier this week. 

The strikes have devastated parts of the region with hundreds of homes destroyed. But, as a yellow Kurdish flag was raised on the same hillside today, signs the terror group has finally been thwarted were rife. 

A video released earlier this month depicted black-clad ISIS fighters patrolling the streets, allegedly keeping Yazidi virgins and young Syrian women locked in brothels for their pleasing. 

Small cells are thought to still be operating within the city, though joint attacks from Kurdish fighters and American and Arab air forces have undoubtedly weakened their position.  

Meanwhile images issued by the Syrian Arab News Agency reveal a stockpile of weapons seized by the Syrian Army in Hama

Hundreds of rounds of ammunition were also seized by troops. Conflicts continue to rage across Syria with different groups fighting consistently 

Where fighters on each side of the multi-faceted conflict are sourcing weaponry has been a point of discussion for months
