A Wisconsin man says he still loves his ex-fiance, despite the fact that she offered $1,000 and sex to a hit man to have him killed. 

John Schellpfeffer, 50, of Merrill, told ABC News that his ex-fiance's murder-for-hire plot was a result of her mental illness and she needs help.

 'I do love [her] to this day,' Schellpfeffer told '20/20' in an interview airing tonight. 

In February, Jessica Strom, 33, planned a meeting with a former classmate to offer him a 'business proposal.' 

Plot: Jessica Strom, 33, offered a hit man $1,000 and sex to kill her ex-fiance

The proposal was this: to shoot her fiance, Schellpfeffer, in his law office and fly the body to Door County in exchange for $1,000 -- and sex.

What Strom didn't know was that the former classmate she hired to kill her ex-fiance and boyfriend of six years was actually an informant working with the local police department.

The mother-of-three was arrested later that evening and is now serving three and a half years in prison, ABC reports.

Prison: In August,  Strom was sentenced to three and a half years in prison for solicitation to commit first-degree intentional homicide. 

Schellpfeffer and Strom have reportedly had their ups and downs during their six years together. Both claim that the other was abusive, according to ABC News. WSAW reports that, Strom has had five straining orders against Schelpfeffer.

At one restraining order hearing, Schelpfeffer reportedly proposed to Strom, and she accepted -- then dropped the order. 

After all of that, Schelpepper is still standing by his girl. 

Love: John Schellpfeffer says he still loves Strom, even though she tried to have him killed

'[It was] a mental drama in her mind, all put together from that mental illness,' Schellpfeffer told ABC News. 'Instead of three years in prison, she should, with effective legal counsel, have been placed in a specialized mental health facility.'

Schellpfeffer blamed Strom's plot to have him killed on a 'hidden mental illness that, with certain triggers, will cause her to also lash out at a loved one,' Schellpfeffer wrote in a Facebook post. 

'I am not embarrassed to say I still love her even though I have now accepted that we will never be together again as I realize that I am a trigger for her abusive acts,' Schellpfeffer wrote.

Schellpfeffer was shown the video recording of Strom orchestrating his murder, but told ABC News that he believes his life was never in any danger and that Strom would have never gone through with the plan.

Strom told authorities that what they thought was a murder-for-hire plot was simply a misunderstanding.  

Strom told ABC news that she did offer the 24-year-old man money and sex to kill her ex-fiance, but she 'said it in a joking sense.' 

Strom told authorities that she had contacted her former classmate, who works in Information Technology, to get technical help with some computer issues. But, Strom denied being serious about the proposal to have Schellpfeffer killed.

'[Schellpfeffer] was frustrating me early that week,' Strom told '20/20.' 'I do know that I said something like, 'Well, you could kill him if you wanted to,'' 

Both Schellpfeffer and Strom have said that the relationship will not continue when she is released from prison, but both confessed that they still love each other.  

Joking: Strom said that she did offer the 24-year-old man money and sex to kill her ex-fiance, but she 'said it in a joking sense'
