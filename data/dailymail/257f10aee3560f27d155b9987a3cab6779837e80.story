The French hospital treating Michael Schumacher has denied rumours that the Formula One legend has died

Rumours of his death prompted some journalists to gather at the hospital.

Schumacher, 45, was put into an artificial coma after suffering traumatic brain injury in a near-fatal skiing accident on December 29. Shutting down function can give the brain time to heal.

Last week his manager Sabine Kehm confirmed that he was being brought round from his coma.

She said: ‘Michael’s sedation has recently been reduced to initiate a process of awakening which may take a long time.’

According to sources cited in the French media the seven-time world champion blinked during brain tests last week.

Citing ‘very reliable sources’, L’Equipe newspaper said Schumacher had undergone a number of neurological tests and had responded ‘positively’.

Surgeons performed two operations to relieve pressure on his brain and remove blood clots in the days following his accident.

Wife Corinna, 44, with whom the champion has two children Gina Marie, 16, and Mick, 14, has remained at his bedside.

Schumacher had his catastrophic accident in the French ski resort of Meribel, where he owns a chalet.

He had been skiing on the piste with his son Mick, 14, and family friends.

Shortly after 11am he skied on to a patch of rocky off-piste located in between two runs.

He skied into a rock and then catapulted on to another banging his head with such force that his helmet split in two.

He was wearing a helmet camera and his entire accident was recorded.

Investigators said it was a freak accident and Schumacher, who is a very competent skier, was not skiing at an excessive speed.

He was airlifted off the mountain and taken to Grenoble University Hospital where doctors put him into a medically-induced coma.

A scan revealed he had suffered serious brain damage.

His manager released a statement later that night saying the sportsman was fighting for his life.

A top neurosurgeon said stricken Michael Schumacher's brain cells are 'working together like a Formula One team' in a bid to get him to wake up from his six  week long coma.  

Dr Munther Sabarini, neurosurgeon and founder of the Avicenna Hospitals in  Berlin, Hamburg and Zurich, says the vital pyramidal neurons - control cells -  'are working together, so to speak, like an F1 team.  So if a driver shows  weakness, then another driver takes over under the new situation.  So it is  with the brain cells.  You can support brain function with a lot of resources  so that the healing process is accelerated and cause as little damage as  possible.

'Typically high-energy bodily functions are shut down during a coma. Only  after awakening can they be enabled again.  The vital signs are observed and  corrected. It is then up to the doctors to do a great deal; physiotherapy,  mental care, treatment of new or old diseases. 

'Depending on the aid required the patient receives medication - usually called neuro vitamins - but the measures applied vary stronly from case to case.   After awakening one needs a few months to a few years to learn to overcome  physical changes. Young and healthy people like Michael Schumacher have better  chances to recover from such a trauma.' 

His medical team at the Grenoble University Hospital in France announced last week they are slowly reducing the anaesthetic that has kept Schumacher, 45, unconscious since his low-speed ski accident on December 29 when he smashed his  head on to rocks. 

This could take many more weeks. Anaesthetic gases which may have accumulated  in his body's fatty tissue must be removed extremely slowly. 

So far, there have been no facial or bodily responses to his environment, according to  medical sources.  He receives food through a tube to his stomach, oxygen via a hose from a machine next to his bed as he still cannot breathe independently.

Three times  daily his joints and muscles are massaged to prevent atrophy and bed sores. 

The coma suppressed his swallowing reflex, pain perception and his respiratory  drive. 

He has to be acutely monitored around the clock during this wake-up  phase to see if such things are returning naturally. 

Experts say that perhaps the greatest risk of all facing Schumacher in his  prone position is pneumonia.  The lack of a competent swallowing mechanism can  make saliva run into the lungs and trigger the potentially lethal respiratory  infection. 

Andreas Pingel, medical director of the Centre for Spine Surgery and  Neuro-Traumatology at the BG Hospital in Frankfurt told Germany's Focus  Magazine; 'About 30 to 50 percent of all patients who lie in a coma as long as  Michael Schumacher has get it.' 

His blood is also thinned to prevent thrombosis and he is regularly turned and  even stood straight up at times to keep blood flowing.  He lies on a special  air-filled mattress to prevent pressure sores and his urinary tract is under  constant vigliance because of the danger of waste bacteria entering the  bloodstream and causing a potentially fatal infection.
