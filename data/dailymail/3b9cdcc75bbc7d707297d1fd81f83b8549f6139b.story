A Kansas City woman has pleaded guilty in a long-running case of child abuse involving her 10-year-old daughter, who was found emaciated and locked in a closet in 2012.

Jacole Prince, 30, entered the please in Jackson County Circuit Court on Tuesday, the Kansas City Star reported.

She has been charged with child abuse, child endangerment and assault and will be sentenced on April 25.

Her daughter, identified only as LP, was pulled from a dingy urine-soaked utility closet in June 2012 in a story that shocked the community.

Guilty: Jacole Prince, the Kansas City woman whose emaciated 10-year-old daughter was rescued from a locked closet in 2012, has pleaded guilty to felony child abuse, child endangerment and assault charges

According to the probable cause statement, Jacole Prince said she locked her daughter in the closet because she was malnourished and was worried she would get in trouble if someone noticed

Police had responded to a call made to  a child abuse hotline.

Officers made their way into the apartment and found a portable crib up against a closet, which it was tied to.

They asked if anyone were inside and a child's voice answered 'yes'.

The girl weighed just 32 pounds.

She told authorities that she hadn't been allowed to eat for days and hadn't attended school since kindergarten.

The girl was transported to a Children's Mercy Hospital, where she was diagnosed with multiple skin injuries and malnourishment, according to NBC News.

Hospital staff said she had gained just six pounds since she last was at the hospital six years earlier.

The girl had been in hospital for 'failing to thrive' in 2006 and it wasn't clear why she had fallen through social services checks.

The girl told detectives who interviewed her at the hospital that that she 'does not want to go back home anymore' and she said she gets in trouble 'because she keeps peeing on herself,' according to the probable cause statement.

Neighbors said the girl's half-sisters, who were two and eight, were well cared for, but that they hadn't seen the 10-year-old.

Other neighbors said they didn't know there was a third child.

All three girls were placed in protective custody.

The eight-year-old said in an interview she never told anyone that she has another sister and that her mother told her she would get in trouble if she did.

According to the probably cause statement, Prince told police she didn't let the girl leave the house because the child is malnourished and she would 'get in trouble if someone saw her'.

Prince's former boyfriend, Marcus Benson, was arrested some time after Prince, after authorities found him hiding in the attic of a home in the Kansas City suburb of Independence.

During an interview with police before he was released, Benson said he didn't live in the apartment. He said he often visited to see the two younger girls, but hadn't seen their half-sister in about a year, according to the probable cause statement.

Benson said that when he asked the mother about the 10-year-old, she told him she was with her aunt or in her room because she was in trouble.

He said he never knew the mother put the girl in the closet or 'he would have done something about it,' the probable cause statement said.

But neighbors said he had been living there for sometime.

The 10-year-old victim said her mother and Benson would fight about keeping the girl in the closet because Benson didn't want her there.

Benson pleaded guilty to child endangerment and initially was sentenced to five years of probation.

Prince, who initially pleaded not guilty, told the judge that she was pleading guilty to the assault and child abuse charges because the strength of the stateâ€™s case was so strong a jury would convict her anyway.
