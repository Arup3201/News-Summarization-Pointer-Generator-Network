One luxury department store is taking an unlikely leaf out of McDonald's book by launching a drive-thru outlet.

But forget Big Macs and diet cokes, because Selfridges are unveiling the world's first luxury drive-thru offering everything from Burberry coats to Chanel handbags.

The high-end drive-thru will allow customers to pull up to a reception area behind the Oxford Street Mecca on Edward Mews and collect purchases they’ve made online at Selfridges.com (you can even order on your smartphone en route).

Is the the most luxurious drive-thru ever? Selfridges is set to launch a drive-thru so customers can collect designer handbags on the go

You don't even need to lift a finger (or pay for parking) because after ordering your luxurious goods, they will be brought to your car by the department store’s staff.

The exciting new concept, which is set to be up and running by January 2014, is part of the 104-year-old store’s massive online push.

Inspiration: Taking inspiration from fast food drive-thrus such as Mcdonalds, Selfridges hope to have the concept up and running by January 2014

Speaking to The Evening Standard, Simon Forster, the company’s multi-channel director said: 'There will be a dedicated area providing the level of service you would expect from Selfridges.

'It will not just be the first drive-thru service, it will be the best.'

Currently, around half of Selfridges products are available to order online but the store predict that everything but perishable food will be available to purchase online by the end of the year.

Food chains such at Tesco and Sainsbury's have previously discussed testing out the scheme to halt profit losses.
