A Kansas City nightclub has been forced to apolizize for a distasteful Tweet that used the word 'rape' as an advertising tool for their New Years Eve party, resulting in a social media storm.

Aura nightclub, located on Main Street near E 39th Street, posted the message on both its Twitter and Facebook accounts Tuesday afternoon.

The post read: 'HOT ANNOUNCEMENT: AURA introduces the anti-rape program... We won't RAPE you on prices on NYE on "all inclusives" where they run out of liquor at 11 pm hahaha'

Kansas City nightclub Aura posted this announcement on their Twitter and Facebook pages on Tuesday as promotion for their New Years Eve party, which erupted in crticism

While the post was deleted about 6pm, with the @Aura_KC account closed down not long after, the damage had already been done.

Hundreds of tweets and Facebook comments had already been posted in protest.

'This is disgusting. Rape is not an advertising tool, morons! It is a horrific, invasive, violent act!' wrote one person on Twitter.

'Rape isn't a joke, or even a colorful word. Words matter...' wrote another person on the club's Facebook page.

'Disappointed in the poor choice of advertising tools,' one woman commented on the clubâ€™s Facebook page.

'Any self respecting woman would not want to set foot in your club after that.'

'Worst social media post of 2013,' someone else tweeted.

Bar owner Stuart Solomon apologized for the offending social media post, saying it was never their intention to offend

Bar owner Stuart Solomon said it was a mistake by a staff member who wasn't thinking properly and that the Tweet was taken out of context.

'Bottom line is, I own the bar. I will take responsibility for anything my members put out, and someone made a horrible mistake,' he told KCTV5.

'Obviously, I think we all know they did not mean for the connotation this was taken in, but they should have obviously chose their words much more wisely.'

Soloman added that, from now on, he will handle all social media for the venue.

Aura describes itself on its website as a 'liquor-fueled playhouse designed for the discerning club goer'.
