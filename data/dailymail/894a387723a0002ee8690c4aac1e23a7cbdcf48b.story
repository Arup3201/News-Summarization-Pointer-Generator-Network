A 'sadistic' killer who tortured and murdered his former partner and their two-year-old daughter has died just months into his whole-life sentence.

David Oakes, 50, was jailed in November after he went to Christine Chambers’s house in Braintree, Essex, where he subjected her to 'degrading assaults' before blasting her and her daughter Shania, two, with a shotgun.

His trial heard that Oakes stormed Ms Chambers’ home, laden with weapons, and killed the family just as they had gained a restraining order against him during a bitter custody battle.

Afterwards he shot himself in the face during a botched suicide attempt, but survived.

MailOnline understands that his death on Monday was not linked to his gunshot wound, and that he may have been terminally ill.

Torture: Oakes forced Christine Chamber to cut chunks of her own hair off before killing her and Shania (pictured together) in an attack that shocked Britain

Oakes had 'systematically tortured' Ms Chambers for several hours before the killings, forcing her to strip and cutting chunks from her hair.

Ms Chambers' 10-year-old daughter fled the house during the ordeal as police outside attempted to negotiate with the killer.

Oakes, of Steeple, near Maldon, was given two whole-life jail terms after being found guilty of the murders, which happened in June last year.

David Oakes' father Peter, 69, today confirmed the killer died from cancer.

Shocked Peter said his son had tumours that spread to his stomach and chest and that he was told a few weeks ago he had only six months left to live.

'I'm shocked, very shocked. I expected him to last at least another six months but he never,' he said.

'He never rang me this weekend for a chat so I thought something may be wrong.

'We use to write letters to each other, I used to send him letters you know and he would write back.

'He was still my son despite being a convicted killer. I still miss him.'

Today the Ministry of Justice confirmed that Oakes had died from natural causes after being taken to hospital.

A Prison Service spokesman said: 'HMP Frankland prisoner David Robert Oakes died at hospital on Monday.

'He is presumed to have died from natural causes.

'As with all deaths in custody, the Independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman will conduct an investigation.'

Attack: Oakes stormed their home in Braintree, Essex, with a number of weapons, intent on killing in the days after Christine had secured a restraining order

Family: Christine Chambers, 38, and her daughter Shania died, but her ten-year-old daughter managed to flee the scene

Oakes had denied two counts of murder but was found guilty after nine hours of jury deliberations at his trial in May.

Mr Justice Fulford ordered Oakes to serve a whole life sentence, making him one of a limited group of inmates who would never be released from prison.

Describing Oakes, he said: 'A bullying and controlling man, who had frequently inflicted violence on Miss Chambers during the six years of their relationship, he killed his ex-partner and their young daughter simply because he knew she could not bear to be with him and wished to start a new life.'

The trial heard Oakes arrived at the house with the shotgun, a drill and an axe.

Oakes did not appear in court to be sentenced, after prison guards raised concerns he would harm himself.

In November, the Court of Appeal refused to quash the whole-life order imposed on the killer.

He was one of several inmates who argued such orders were incompatible with Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment.

Judges rejected that argument, saying: 'Each of these appellants is dangerous, and on the available evidence, likely to remain dangerous for the indefinite future.'
