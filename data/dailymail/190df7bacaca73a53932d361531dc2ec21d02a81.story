An unlikely duo were both in attendance at the Mestalla as Barcelona grabbed a last-gasp winner against Valencia - with Manchester United legends Paul Scholes and Phil Neville taking in the action.

Neville tweeted a photo of himself with Scholes and the caption: 'With the main man!!!'

The pair both came through United academy's Class of 92 - before being reunited on the Old Trafford club's coaching staff after David Moyes' tenure came to an end.

Moyes became manager of Real Sociedad last month as he looks to restore his coaching reputation following his disastrous reign at Old Trafford.

His first home match in charge saw Carlos Vela bag a hat-trick in a 3-0 victory over Elche on Friday. 

The presence of one of his former coaching staff visiting Spain - Neville was brought back to United from Everton by Moyes - does raise the possibility of both Scholes and his ex-team-mate joining the ex-Toffees boss at Anoeta as the Scot looks to stamp his authority on the club.

At the Mestalla, however, Sergio Busquets snatched all three points for Barca with the last kick of the game on Sunday - but controversy surrounded the final moments as Lionel Messi was hit in the head with a bottle.
