Robots are helping stroke victims to regain the use of their arms.

The machines work by supporting a patient’s arm and letting them move it between targets on a computer screen, to build up their strength and improve their coordination.

‘Rehabilitation robots’, which have been seen in a number of studies are being taken more and more seriously, with a major trial underway at Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and Newcastle University.

The stroke patient sits at a table facing a computer screen and places their arm on to the robotic device.

A therapist then asks the patient to undertake some arm exercises, such as moving between targets on the computer screen.

If the person is unable to move their arm, then the robot moves the patient's limb for them.

If the patient starts to move, the robot provides adjustable levels of assistance to help out, in turn helping the brain and arm to learn to work together again.

Helen Rodgers, professor of stroke care at the institute for ageing and health at Newcastle University, leading the research, said: 'Announcing the start of this clinical trial is a really exciting step forward for stroke rehabilitation research in the UK.

‘We have been looking at the research undertaken in the USA and we are working closely with colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to see if robot assisted training is an effective treatment.

‘If shown to be effective, robot assisted training has the potential to change how we provide NHS rehabilitation for people with arm weakness due to stroke.’

North Tyneside General Hospital is one of 16 stroke services to take part in the five-year clinical trial and is one of the first in the country to use the new robot.

The £250,000 rehabilitation equipment was invented by scientists at MIT.

A total of £3million has been given to the scheme by the National Institute for Health Research and a clinical trial in America has already shown that robot-assisted training may improve upper limb recovery.

Researchers from Newcastle University will work in collaboration with teams from the Universities of Glasgow, East London and Cambridge, as well as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and NHS stroke teams to test the equipment.

Dr Hermano Igo Krebs, principal research scientist and lecturer at MIT, said: ‘The robotic technology we have developed at MIT is already helping many stroke patients and people with other neurological conditions in the U.S.

‘Our focus is on helping clinicians to facilitate a functional recovery for their patients by using intensive and highly interactive robotic therapy.

‘By using robotics, not only do we get a greater understanding of the neuro recovery process, but we can also build a rich stream of data that assists in ongoing patient diagnosis and customisation of the therapy.’

From April, researchers began to recruit patients who had suffered a stroke for the first time to participate in the clinical trial.

Stroke sufferer Tom Means, 61, from Walkerville, Newcastle, is one of the patients already taking part in the robot clinical trial. 

He had a 
stroke in March this year and spent around two months in hospital. Now 
back at home, he continues to receive physiotherapy twice a week.

Mr
 Means attends North Tyneside General Hospital three times a week for 
the 45-minute sessions on the stroke robot as part of the trial.

If the person is unable to move their arm, then the robot moves the patient's limb for them (pictured). If the patient starts to move, the robot provides adjustable levels of assistance to help out, which helps the brain and arm to learn to work together again

After only a few sessions into the 12-week programme, he is already seeing improvements in his arm and shoulder.

Mr
 Means, who used to work as a self-employed electrician, was unable to 
use his right arm or walk, but has gradually regained movement.

‘When you've had a stroke, every bit of exercise and movement you can do is a big help,’ he said.

‘Using the robot alongside my other exercises is ideal for me and what's great about the robot is that it also helps my hand-eye co-ordination.

‘I've only had a few sessions so far, however I've really felt the difference in my arm as I've got a lot more movement and much more strength.

‘I'm under no illusions that it's going to be a lot of hard work but it's all worthwhile because I know it's going to make me better.

‘I'm pleased to be taking part in the trial and helping people who suffer a stroke in the future.’
