Perhaps it was a question of bear necessity, as one furry felon was filmed breaking into a sweet shop no less than seven times in 15 minutes to grab a host of sugary treats.

The smarter than average bear, who could have given Yogi and his mate Boo Boo a run for their money, pawed his way through the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store in Estes Park, Colorado to find his favourite candies.

These apparently include English toffee,  chocolate-chip cookies dipped in caramel and milk chocolate appropriately named 'cookie bears'.

Bear with paw-pose: The young animal makes his way through the front door and over to the counter of the sweet shop

Amazingly, the cheeky thief used the front door and didn't break a thing during the daylight raid. But once inside, the young black bear behaved, well, just like any other kid in a candy store.

Cautious at first, he simply grabbed the candy nearest to the registers, duly carried them outside and ate them.

The sweet-toothed mammal then grew braver and returned to the shop another seven times for more, only leaving when a passing car scared him away.

Store owner Jo Adams said the bear managed to pop open the door, because the deadbolt was not completely secured.

The only evidence that her sneaky visitor left behind was some dirt on a counter and paper on the ground. There weren't even any wrappers left, so she assumes he ate those too.

'He was very clean and very careful. He ate a lot of candy,' said Adams of the bear break-in, which was first reported by the Estes Park News.

Pawfect: The thief finds what he's looking for shortly before scampering off with his haul

Bears looking for leftover food are often sighted sniffing around people's homes, cars and street rubbish in Colorado's mountain towns, including Estes Park, which is the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park.

But an ongoing drought this year has made the resourceful animals even more brazen in their search for food.

The 'store owner added: 'We're in their turf, and you just put up with these things when they happen.'
