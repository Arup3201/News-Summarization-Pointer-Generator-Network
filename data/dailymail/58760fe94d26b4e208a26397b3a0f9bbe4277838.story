Gordon Ramsay is embroiled in a High Court row claiming he should not be held personally responsible for the £640,000-a-year rent of his London pub and restaurant.

The chef, who took on a 25-year-lease of the York and Albany in 2007, claims his signature as a personal guarantee for the pub's rent was forged using an automatic machine without his permission. 

Mr Ramsay acquired the property while his father-in-law, Christopher Hutcheson, was still at the helm of Gordon Ramsay Holdings before leaving in 2010 after he was accused  of plundering more than £1million from the company.

Following a lengthy legal dispute, he was reportedly given around £2million in a settlement and severed ties with the company.

Afterwards Mr Ramsay's lawyers discovered for the first time that the TV personality was personally guaranteeing the rent on the York and Albany in Regent's Park, the court heard today.

Mr Ramsay claims he never agreed to this and that his father-in-law used a Ghost Writer - a machine which reproduced Mr Ramsay's handwriting - to forge his signature.

Today he told of his 'shock and horror' that he believed his father-in-law had forged his signature, adding his 'deep and extensive trust in Hutcheson was entirely misplaced', and that he had defrauded him and the group 'hundreds of thousands of pounds'. 

The chef claims the machine had been acquired 'for purposes of merchandising only'. 

The owner of the pub, film director Gary Love, dismissed his allegations as 'absurd' and accused the chef of trying to wriggle out of his rental commitments. 

In 2007, Gordon Ramsay Holdings won a bidding war to secure a 25-year lease on the 160-year old building, while Mr Hutcheson was CEO of the company.

It has since been turned it into an upmarket pub, restaurant and hotel, with rooms starting at £150. 

In 2010 Mr Hutcheson left his position in the company amid reports that he had a 'fiery relationship' with Mr Ramsay.

It was later claimed in court the former manager had breached terms of his confidentiality contract to access private emails and plunder more than £1million from the TV chef's empire.

He was accused of writing himself 'five-figure cheques', and involving Mr Ramsay's siblings-in-law in the schemes. 

In 2012 their dispute was settled, with Mr Ramsay's wife, Tana, thought to have severed all ties with her family. 

The latest legal row comes as Mr Ramsay's lawyers were 'piecing back together' what remains of his business following his father-in-law's departure, the court heard.

Mr Ramsay acquired the York and Albany in 2007 after winning a bidding war for a lease on the 160-year-old building. It is now an upmarket pub, restaurant and hotel in north west London's Regent's Park 

Giving evidence, Mr Ramsay said that between six and nine months after Mr Hutcheson was 'removed from the business' in 2010, 'it was discovered then that the lease was signed by the ghost machine'.

He said it was discovered that 'there were several documents that had been forged'.

Cross-examined by Romie Tager QC, for Mr Love, the chef said he could not remember exactly which documents had been forged, adding he and his wife were then 'going through a very difficult time', telling the court that 'there were several emails that were hacked so it is hard to categorise exactly when and what we discovered'. 

He said his father-in-law 'never had permission' to sign any deal 'via a ghost machine'.

Mr Hutcheson is accused of using the Ghost Writer machine to sign 'various contracts' in his son-in-law's name without his knowledge during his time at the company. 

The case continues.
