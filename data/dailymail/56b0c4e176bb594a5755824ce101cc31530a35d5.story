This should come as no surprise to anyone who has ever been on a long road trip or an all-inclusive holiday with their in-laws.

As the half-term holiday approaches, a recent survey has revealed that just three per cent of Brits would prefer to go on a trip with their partner’s parents.

It appears men enjoy – or tolerate – trips with their in-laws far more than women do. Of the three per cent who would welcome such a getaway, two-thirds were male.

We are family: A survey found that just three per cent of Brits would prefer to go on a trip with their in-laws

Bring the kids? Only 30 per cent of those polled said they prefer to travel with their children

The survey asked 1,000 UK adults to rank their top travel companions and it found that travel is not always a family affair.

Just 13 per cent of respondents said they prefer to go on holiday with their parents, with a higher percentage of women favouring getaways with mum and dad. 

In comparison, six per cent said they prefer to travel alone than with a partner, friend or someone else, according to the poll commissioned by travel search website Momondo.co.uk.

It should come as no surprise that a majority of Brits – 64 per cent – would rather travel with their partner or spouse than anyone else.

As for typical family getaways only 30 per cent of those polled said they prefer to travel with their children.

The survey found that more women (60 per cent) prefer the company off their offspring than men (40 per cent)

The option of travelling with children ranked slightly higher than travelling with friends, which was preferred by 29 per cent of respondents.

Lasse Skole Hansen, spokesman for Momondo.co.uk, said: ‘It is fair to say our survey uncovered some home truths about family dynamics when it comes to going away.

‘Without reverting too much to stereotype it seems the age-old label of the ‘nagging in-laws’ must still hold some truth today as just a very small percentage of those we surveyed like to travel with their in-laws.

‘Taking trips overseas is all about experiencing the unknown, so it makes sense that Brits tend to prefer partners, spouses or friends as fellow travellers to perhaps make for a more chilled break.’
