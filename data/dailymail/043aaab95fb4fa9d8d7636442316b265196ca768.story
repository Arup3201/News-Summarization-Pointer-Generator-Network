A Beaver Scout group has been hit by allegations of an affair between its married leader and one of the women who volunteers there after her partner made claims on the group's webpage.

Software developer Billy Fagan, 36, posted a message on the website of Stonywood Scouts, in Aberdeen, yesterday, accusing partner Catherine Mcneice, 35, of being unfaithful.

In the message, which he described as 'whisky-infused', he claimed Miss McNiece, who he has at least one child with, had been sleeping with scout leader Gareme Lornie, 48.

Billy Fagan, 36 (left), used the website of the Stonywood Scouts, based near Aberdeen, to post a  message claiming partner Catherine Mcneice, 35 (right), was having an affair with leader Gareme Lornie, 48

In the message Mr Fagan claims Miss Mcneice had been exchanging flirtatious texts with married Mr Lornie (pictured) since last summer

The letter was entitled 'Leaders in Love' and had a sub heading, which read 'two of our leaders scouting each other out (wink, wink).'

He wrote: 'Yes, our Beavers leader Catherine and our Scout leader Graeme have recently found a liking for each other’s attentions. And who can blame them!

'Following their regular nights together at scouts and all their camping adventures they've decided to take their love into the digital age with a series of texts showing their involvement.

'Over the past eight months  they've shared numerous flirtatious texts.'

Mr Fagan went on to claim that the text messages began last summer, adding that Mr Lornie's wife had also been unaware they were writing to one another.

He then offered to make the conversations available 'upon request', before adding: 'Billy, Catherine's partner and writer of this whisky-infused post, wishes them all the best for a long and happy life together.

In the message, entitled 'Leaders in Love' with the second headling 'Two of our leaders scouting each other out (wink wink), Mr Fagan describes himself as 'whisky-infused'

Mr Fagan was unavailable to comment on the message, but has since posted on Facebook telling his friends: 'All is fine here thanks guys. My good pal Glen (Livet) is sorting the day out fabulously'

'Obviously this affair should not be allowed to affect the running of the Stoneywood Scouts and indeed, it's being kept well under wraps.'

In the final part of the message he wrote that Scouts had been given a 'seedy' reputation in the press recently, likely referring to recent allegations of sexual abuse within the movement.

But, he wrote, the alleged affair should not be treated 'as a reflection of scouting as a whole'. 

He stated: 'I have never known anyone involved in scouts, as a scout themselves or as a leader, who has not gotten a whole lot of value out of being part of the movement.

'Everyone speaks highly of the organisation, the commitment of the volunteers and the integrity of the leaders to ensure it's a safe and appropriate part of your children's upbringings.'

When contacted about the claims yesterday, Miss Mcneice and Mr Lornie both refused to comment.

Mr Lornie (left) has been married to wife Kay for 27 years, who said the message 'did not come as a surprise'. Miss Mcneice is not married to Mr Fagan, but the pair have at least one child together, a daughter, eight

At Mr Lornie's home his wife of 27 years Kay, 55, answered the door. She said Billy’s post 'did not come as a surprise', but declined to say more according to the Daily Record. 

Mr Fagan, who has an eight-year-old daughter with Miss McNeice, also refused to say more, but posted on Facebook, telling friends: 'All is fine here thanks guys. My good pal Glen (Livet) is sorting the day out fabulously.'

A Scouts spokeswoman said: 'Scouts Scotland was made aware of a posting on a local Scout Group's website that caused offence and immediate steps were taken to ensure that the inappropriate posting was removed. 

'The circumstances are being investigated in order to determine what further actions may be required.'
