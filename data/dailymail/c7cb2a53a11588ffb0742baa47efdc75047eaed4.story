Hark! A new tablet has descended to reward the faithful - letting Christians enjoy cutting-edge computing without the risks.

The Edifi tablet is a full-colour touchscreen, much like Apple's iPad - but it's pre-loaded with Bible passages, Christian radio stations and free religious e-Books.

The seven-inch Android tablet is $149, and will launch soon in America - and even non-believers might be tempted by its low price.Â

'Our full-color touch display e-reader puts thousands of ebooks at your fingertips,' says makers Edifi.

The company also offers a range of free and paid-for religious texts, as well as 27 translated versions of the bible.

The wi-fi only device also offers 'safe' web browsing, with a custom-built web browser which blocks 'unsuitable' sites.

There are also pre-loaded apps for listening to Christian radio stations.

The HD screen can also play films, music, and download social networking apps.
