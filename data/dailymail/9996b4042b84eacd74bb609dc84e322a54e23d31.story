A former Marine has pleaded not guilty to killing the pregnant wife of another Marine.

Christopher Lee, 24, entered the plea on Tuesday to first-degree murder with a special allegation of lying in wait.

Lee said next to nothing at the short hearing in California where his lawyer pleaded not guilty on his behalf. 

Lee was arrested in Alaska on August 17 after the body of 19-year-old Erin Corwin was found down a 100-foot mine shaft near Joshua Tree in the Mojave Desert. The Tennessee native went missing on June 28.

The body of Erin Corwin, 19, was found down a mine shaft near Joshua Tree in the Mjoave Desert on August 17. Her alleged lover Christopher Brandon Lee, 24, was arrested in Anchorage, Alaska last week and pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to her murder 

Prosecutors said that Corwin and the married Lee were lovers. Her husband, Cpl. Jonathan Corwin, and Lee were both stationed at the Twentynine Palms Marine base.

MailOnline revealed last week that Lee allegedly cheated on his high-school sweetheart wife Nichole with neighbor Erin in a secret five-month affair amid claims she became pregnant with his child. It has been alleged that Lee was terrified that his wife would find out.

The murdered woman's husband, Marine Cpl Jonathan Corwin, attended the hearing with his father Tom and sat in the back of the courtroom, according to The Deseret Sun. Lee's wife Nichole was not present in court.  

Police sources said Lee has admitted conducting internet searches on human body disposal, and a witness told detectives that Lee asked him 'what was the best way to dispose of a human body,' a sheriff's investigator wrote in a document filed in San Bernardino County Superior Court in support of an arrest warrant.

Lee had allegedly searched online for the best ways to dispose of a human body before Mrs Corwin's body was found down a mine shaft in California 

In addition, .22-caliber fired casings and rebar were recovered from the scene where Erin's body was found in the abandoned mine shaft.

The head stamp from the casings matched those on casings found in Lee's vehicle and home, the document said. 

Lee is due back in court for his next hearing on September 16. 

Erin’s chance of becoming a new mom was cruelly snatched away on June 28 when she vanished.

She was allegedly murdered and her killer dumped her body down a 140ft deep mineshaft in a remote area around two miles from her home on Twentynine Palms Marine Base in California. She was three-weeks pregnant.

The woman had told her Marine husband Jonathan Corwin she was headed to Joshua Tree National Park to scout trails she and her mother could later bike, but she never returned home.

Her Toyota Corolla was found two days later abandoned just blocks from the Twentynine Palms Marine Base.

The alleged killer's wife, Nichole Lee, was not in the California courtroom on Tuesday

According to search warrant documents, tire tracks matching those of Lee’s Jeep were found near to Erin’s car. 

Search and rescue teams scoured a 300-square-miles area round Joshua Tree National Park, including more than 100 mine shafts, for nearly two months before Corwin's body was found.

The investigation grew to focus on Lee, who was the Corwins' neighbor at the Marine Base, according to court papers.

Erin’s friend told investigators that Corwin and Lee were having an affair and that the unborn child might be Lee's, the papers showed. 

A close friend said Erin had become friends with Lee and his wife Nichole and the trio often visited a horse ranch just outside the town of Joshua Tree. 

MailOnline revealed last week that the newly pregnant 19-year-old  was ‘super-excited’ at having a baby after suffering a miscarriage earlier this year.

Erin was heart-broken when she lost her first baby in February after complications during a brief pregnancy. 

But friends say the young girl was thrilled to fall pregnant for a second time and was looking forward to having a healthy baby.
