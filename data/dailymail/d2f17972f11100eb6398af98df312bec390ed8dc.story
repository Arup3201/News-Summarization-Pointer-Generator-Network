Manuel Pellegrini believes football will be the loser when his Manchester City team face CSKA Moscow behind closed doors here on Tuesday night.

The Champions League group game at the Arena Khimki will be played in a surreal atmosphere after UEFA punished the home team for the behaviour of their fans in recent games.

But City boss Pellegrini believes nobody wins from the decision.

He said: 'I had this experience many years ago. I can’t remember when.

'It will be very strange with everybody being able to hear the players’ voices during the game.

'But we have no option and we must play that way.

'Many may think the local team will suffer the most damage, but I think the biggest loser is the game of football.

'It’s a pity that we can’t play with fans. This show is for fans and it will be a strange game.' 

While Pellegrini has experienced the surreal atmosphere of an empty stadium before, it will be a new experience for Pablo Zabaleta.

He said: 'It will be strange. I have never had the experience before. Sometimes it happens. We just have to take care of ourselves. I hope we can play a great game and get an important three points.'

City have yet to win in Group E, losing to Bayern Munich in Germany on matchday one and then drawing at home to Roma. But the full back sees now reason to change their attacking approach against in-form CSKA, who sit second in the Russian league and beat Kuban Krasnodar 6-0 at the weekend.

Zabaleta added: 'We have great defenders. Normally we like to attack and sometimes we can concede space at the back.

'It would be easy to put 10 players in our own half but we aren't that kind of team. We press high and leave space between the lines, that's the way we like to play and we won't change.' 

Pellegrini launched a stern defence of Yaya Toure, who has come in for criticism for his inconsistent performances this season.

The Chilean said: 'If you compare his performances to last year's brilliant form maybe he just needs time.

Sergio Aguero scored all four goals in City's 4-1 win over Tottenham at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday

'He will continue to be a very important player for our team, if you look at his goal against Villa you can see his quality. He had a busy summer but he's getting better and is getting near to his normal form.' 

Pellegrini also suggested that Toure could be deployed as a No 10 in the future.

He said: 'It can be an option because he has the quality to play behind the striker. In the national team [Ivory Coast] he plays forward.

'In our team he's a very important midfielder and he will continue to play in that role. When he has had problems it's because the team has had problems.

Pablo Zabaleta said City will not change their approach and will take the match to CSKA on Tuesday

Pellegrini defended his midfielder Yaya Toure after some inconsistent performances this season

'When he plays well in his midfield position he is the best at that role in the Premier League.' 

Their slow start to the group stage underlined just how far City have to go to succeed on the European stage, but Zabaleta believes sheer hard graft is the key.

'It takes time,' the Argentine said. 'We are a team that's improved in the last few years but this competition demands so much, playing the best teams in Europe.

'We are improving and have great players but this is so difficult. We would like to win this but we have to work really hard to do it.

'We just need to work hard and win games and learn from mistakes in previous years.'

Sergio Aguero scored twice at the Arena Khimki to give City a crucial victory

The two teams met at this point in the Champions League last season, with two Sergio Aguero goals earning City a vital 2-1 victory.

But a bone of contention was the state of the pitch at the Arena Khimki, which had been unable to cope with heavy rainfall and was badly cut up. Pellegrini said it was 'unbelievable' that the match had been able to go ahead on such a poor surface.

Although the match is expected to be played in sub-zero temperatures, with the first snowfall of the Russian winter seen over the weekend, Pellegrini has no complaints about the surface.

He said: 'Last year we were concerned. It was impossible and we knew that before the game. This year, no. It's not the best as its difficult here in winter but its normal and we have no problems.'
