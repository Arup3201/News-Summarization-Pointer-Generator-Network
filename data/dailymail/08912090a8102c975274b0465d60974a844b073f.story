A 15-year-old girl who founded a babysitting business from her bedroom during her sixth grade summer vacation could end up making millions from the company, just three years after it was first set up. 

New York schoolgirl Noa Mintz founded Nannies for Noa when she was just 12 years old, after growing tired of seeing her parents spending hundreds of dollars to employ babysitters who seemed entirely uninterested in her and her three younger siblings. 

'For what you’re paying, your kids should be more stimulated,' Noa, who is now a freshman in High School, told the New York Post. 'At 7, I would tell my mom, "You need to get more bang for your buck." It would drive me insane.'

Eager to try and prove to her parents that there were better nannies and babysitters available, Noa took matters into her own hands and began sourcing childcare services for her own family - and then a number of her family friends. 

'I realized that agencies didn't realize what that real New York nanny was,' she told the Today show. 'It's not a qualification, it's not something you can just see in a personality, it's really just a vibe you get and I knew what that vibe was. 

'So I helped my mom get someone great, then I helped some family friends... and the business really took off from there.'

Three years after her business was founded, with the help of her father, Noa now employs more than 75 people, around 25 full-time nannies and 50 part-time babysitters. 

Nannies for Noa takes a 15 per cent cut of its full-time employees' salaries, which range from $50,000 to $80,000 per year. When it comes to part-time babysitting services, clients are charged a flat rate of $5. All of which amounts to some fairly impressive profits - which Noa refuses to divulge or discuss. 

However, business has now become so busy for Noa and her team that the precocious teenager has had to appoint a CEO to take over the day-to-day running of the company so that she can focus more time and energy on her school work.

Working 9 to 5: Noa still keeps a close eye on any and all developments within her company, which now employs more than 75 people

Helping hand: Allison Johnson (L) was hired as the company's new CEO. The 26-year-old is a licensed social worker and originally applied to the company as a full-time nanny

Enter 26-year-old Allison Johnson, a licensed social worker who originally applied to Noa's company as a nanny and ended up as its new CEO.

'At the end of eighth grade, I started to realize that I wasn't doing the business justice by putting in so many hours, because those hours weren't quality hours,' she explained. 

Now, Noa takes more of a backseat role when it comes to all of the daily administration required to run such a booming business - but still ensures that she keeps a beady eye on any and all developments that take place. 

Still, even after three years of running such a successful business, Noa admits that people are still skeptical when they first learn about her age.  

'People will doubt me and I think that I always try and assure people that I'm a businesswoman, I really know what I'm doing, I've learned a lot,' she added.

'And people really trust me and that really vouches for how successful our brand has been that they would trust someone so young and they've been so pleased with our nannies.'
