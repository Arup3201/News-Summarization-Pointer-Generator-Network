Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond has said the Argentinians behaved 'like animals' and threw rocks at them when they filmed the much-publicised Christmas special in the country. 

The Top Gear cast and crew had to flee the South American country after they were attacked by an angry mob, which frontman Jeremy Clarkson described as 'the most terrifying thing I've ever been involved in.'

Clarkson, who has been widely criticised in the past for making insensitive jokes, was pictured in a Porsche with the licence plate 'H982 FKL' - thought by some to refer to the war of 1982. 

The controversial number plate inflamed long-running tensions and incensed locals, with Clarkson claiming they wanted to 'barbecue us and eat the meat'.

Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond maintains the controversial numberplate was simply a coincidence 

He said the Argentinians 'behaved like animals' when they smashed up the cast's classic cars 

Argentine officials and newspapers took offence at the number plate, which they said was a 'provocation'

Speaking on tonight's Chatty Man on Channel 4, Hammond maintains the number plate was a coincidence and criticised the animosity directed at them.

He tells host Alan Carr: 'They scared the crap out of our crew and that is unfair. You will see it all in the show. Every window on every car was smashed.'

He added: 'That car, there were only two in the UK. We have never checked a number plate in our lives. That is the numberplate the car was born with.' 

His remarks follow previous comments he made to Radio 2 when he claimed the programme team felt 'a real chill' when it dawned on them their number plate could cause offence in Argentina.

He said: 'There was a tweet from somebody pointing out that one of the registration plates on one of the cars could be seen as having a reference to the Falklands War.

'There was a real chill went through all of us - it was a distinct moment, we all (went) "hang on a minute - it's a bit tenuous but yet it probably does"'.

He went on: 'That's when we realised we had to do something about it. That's kind of why we've all got our hands up saying "hang on a minute - the idea that we'd planned that is pretty much impossible and certainly isn't true"'.

He added: 'We didn't look at the plates. I've never looked at a number plate that we've used on a car for a special. Not with that kind of cynical outlook.

'You just get the car you want. There were only two of those 928 GTs for sale in the UK at the time - one of which was the one that we got.'

'We do spend quite a lot of time sailing quite close to the line. We know that, our viewers know that and sometimes we only know the line is there when we look back over our shoulders and say "oh we've gone over it" and we put our hands up - "fair enough, we got that wrong".

'On this occasion we were very keen for our viewers not to think that we would have done that gag, that it was deliberate, because it wasn't. We want them to know that it isn't.'

The BBC refused to apologise to the Argentinian ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, after the furore which Clarkson claimed made him fear for his life. 

In his newspaper column he revealed how he hid under a hotel bed  as an armed mob warned 'this is a mafia state, best you do as you're told'.

Together with Hammond and fellow presenter James May they hid while an angry gang of locals rampaged through the building looking for them.

Clarkson and the Top Gear team had flown into Buenos Aires on September 17, before heading to the ski resort of Bariloche to start a 1,350 filmed trek along the country's famous Patagonian Highway - route 40 - to the world's southernmost city of Ushuaia.

The controversy over his number plate erupted as he neared Ushuaia, from where the General Belgrano sailed only to be torpedoed by the submarine HMS Conqueror during the 1982 conflict.

Clarkson said: 'Our producers tried to explain that we were there to film at a ski resort and then to host a game of car football in the city – England v Argentina. The bottom of the World Cup we were going to call it.

'They were not listening. They were angry. They said that they were not violent but that a group of men from the local truckers' trade union were on their way.

And that when they arrived things would definitely turn nasty. Our local fixers advised that we stop filming immediately, leave the cars and go to a nearby hotel.' 

With the locals baying for their blood, government officials warned them to leave the country.

Clarkson revealed he and eight other members of the crew 'rounded up the girls from our party' and fled to the airport. 

But the furious locals pursued the rest of the crew and hurled bricks at their convoy, smashing windows and injuring two of the party - before they escaped via tractor in to Chile. 

The attack took place in Ushuaia, on the southern tip of Argentina, from where the General Belgrano sailed only to be torpedoed by the submarine HMS Conqueror during the 1982 conflict

The Falkland Islands were taken briefly by Argentina during its 1982 invasion which preceded a 74-day war with Britain.

The war claimed the lives of 649 Argentinians and 255 Britons.

Argentinian president Cristina Kirchner has attacked Britain repeatedly over the Falklands since taking over power following the death of her husband Nestor.

The controversial number plate is not likely to be a private one and was attached to the car when the BBC received it for filming, a spokesman for the show said. 

The H at the beginning of the plate represents the year in which it was produced - 1991. 

FKL, the last three letters, represent where the vehicle was first registered. In this case it was Maidstone in Kent. 

The numbers in between these characters are chosen at random by the DVLA. 

Porsche confirmed the car was not bought from them by producers at Top Gear, but from a private owner. 

It is possible to transfer registration plates to a new vehicle for £80. 

Plates beginning in NIQ or Q - Northern Ireland registered vehicles - cannot be transferred. 

Motorists cannot transfer a registration plate if it will make the new car look younger.  

The Falklands issue is particularly sensitive in southern Argentina, and Ushuaia has blocked several British-flagged cruise ships from docking under a controversial local law named after an Argentinian cowboy who led a bloody 19th century uprising against the British. 

The programme has been embroiled in a string of controversies over the years, including accusations of racism after Clarkson apparently mumbled the word n***** during an outtake and referred to an Asian man as a 'slope' during a Burma special.

In 2011, Hammond prompted a complaint by the Mexican ambassador after he suggested a Mexican car would be 'lazy, feckless, flatulent, overweight'.

In an interview with the Radio Times, the 44-year-old refused to say whether the BBC have since warned the Top Gear team to be more careful.

But he said: 'In society as a whole, we love to be offended and have a scapegoat.

'But at Top Gear we're the first to put our hands up and say we pitched it wrong. We have apologised.

'We're not in the business of genuinely upsetting or offending anyone. We're in the business of entertainment, and if it fails to entertain, it's wrong. If the public says we stepped over the line, then we have.'
