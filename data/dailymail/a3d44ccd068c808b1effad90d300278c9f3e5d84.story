An unjustified suspicion of statins is costing lives, one of Britain’s most senior doctors warned  last night.

Professor Sir Rory Collins compared fears over the cholesterol-reducing drugs to the MMR  vaccine scare, in which a researcher falsely claimed the jabs could cause autism.

Sir Rory, of Oxford University, singled out the British Medical Journal for running articles criticising statins, adding: ‘It is a serious disservice to British and international medicine.’

Seven million Britons take satins - which lower the cholesterol in the arteries that can lead to heart attacks

Referring to the MMR scandal, he added: ‘I would think the papers on statins are far worse in terms of the harm they have done.’

The professor, one of the UK’s leading experts on statins, said he believes GPs are being made unjustifiably suspicious of the drugs and not prescribing them, causing avoidable deaths.

Seven million Britons take the treatment, which lowers the cholesterol in the arteries that can lead to heart attacks.

But many doctors still hesitate to 
prescribe them because of reports of harmful side-effects such as 
nausea, insomnia, fatigue and kidney and muscle problems.

Sir Rory warned the claims of side-effects were particularly damaging because they eroded public confidence.

Speaking to the Guardian, he said: ‘We have really good data from over 100,000 people that show that statins are very well tolerated. There are only one or two well-documented side-effects.’

Myopathy, or muscle weakness, occurred in one in 10,000 people, he said, and there was a small increase in diabetes.

Only last week, a major study found that statins have virtually no side-effects. Scientists found that patients taking the drugs were less likely to suffer adverse symptoms than a control group taking a placebo.

Researchers at Imperial College London looked at 29 trials involving more than 80,000 patients and found the drug only raised the risk of diabetes.

Draft NHS guidelines will advise men over 50 and women over 60 to take the drugs as a precaution, which could raise the number using them to 12million.
