The owner of a property near GCHQ where Banksy daubed his ‘Spybooth’ artwork has claimed that the mural had made his life a misery after being given listed status.

David Possee could have expected a windfall after the work was sprayed onto the side of his end-of-terrace property close to Britain's surveillance centre in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

But after the stencil was granted Grade II-listed status, Mr Possee, 45, has been unable to remove and sell it - and cannot carry out building work to make the house habitable.

Eavesdropping: Spybooth features three 1950s-style agents, wearing brown trench coats and trilby hats, using devices to tap into conversations at a telephone box on the side of the £300,000 property

Public interest: Dozens of people came to see the artwork after it was sprayed onto the side of an end-of-terrace property close to Britain's surveillance centre in April 2014 in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire

As a result he cannot rent out the home, which is empty. He claimed he has been harassed by ‘malicious busybodies’ and now just wants to sell the property - so he can ‘get on with my life’.

Mr Possee said: ‘If Cheltenham want it, they can have it. Just buy the building off me, I just want to get on with my life. Cut me free, you can have the Cheltenham Banksy.’

It appeared last April before soaring in value when Banksy confirmed it was one of his pieces.

The wall was boarded up but a bidding war ensued as locals tried to raise an estimated £1million to secure it for the town. A businessman claimed to have raised enough, but his bid fell through.

Protection: Scaffolding was put up over the artwork after it was vandalised. After the stencil was granted Grade II-listed status, Mr Possee, 45, has been unable to remove and sell it

Covering: It was feared the chunk of wall could be removed and sold, but last month Cheltenham Borough Council voted to incorporate the mural into the building’s existing Grade II-listed status

It was feared the chunk of wall could be removed and sold, but last month Cheltenham Borough Council voted to incorporate the mural into the building’s existing Grade II-listed status.

This means Mr Possee - whose home is thought to have tripled in value since the mural was painted - now cannot carry out urgent repairs to strengthen and re-render the walls.

He said: ‘If this had been any other artist, it [the listed status] would have been laughed out of the chambers. I have no idea where I go from here.'

Mr Possee said he could fight the decision, but that would mean him spending his own money to launch a case at the High Court.

He said the council ‘agreed in principle’ to protect the mural when he first approached them for help.

Speaking to Terry Mechan on community radio station Swindon 105.5, he said: ‘They didn’t come up with any sort of ideas. So I suggested Perspex but they said it’s against listed consent.

Spybooth: The Banksy piece in its vandalised state. Mr Possee said he has had 'substantial offers from people who collect this kind of artwork'

‘They just said “you can’t put that on there” and I was threatened with a fine.'

He added: 'I think it deserves to stay in Cheltenham, but obviously it is difficult to re-render a house that has that artwork on it.

‘It’s sat empty now, and it can’t stay that way forever. At the end of the day, we can sit and let gravity take an effect and the decision will be made for us.’

Mr Possee has even been targeted by men posing as ‘millionaire architects’ trying to buy the building, who turned out to be frauds.

Controversy has surrounded the piece since its arrival, leaving the landlord inundated with ‘malicious messages’ from locals desperate to keep it in the town.

He added: ‘Some busybody from Cheltenham even came up with this idea that I didn’t own that part of the house. 

'There’s not a "pretty strong certainty" that I own it - it is certain that I do. I take a bit of umbrage with people getting involved with my business when it’s nothing to do with them. 

‘I’ve had substantial offers from people who collect this kind of artwork - and if it was about money for me I’d have sold it by now.’ 

After listed status was granted last month, the council's case officer Martin Chandler said: 'It will be afforded a greater level of protection than it has currently.

'But it doesn't mean we won't be faced with future applications to consider other changes to it. It [planning consent] doesn't automatically mean it's going to be retained in situ.'

Seeing the Banksy for the first time when he returned from holiday in April 2014, Mr Possee said he thought it was ‘quite nice’ and liked the new addition before the problems began.
