For most animal lovers, the fleeting dream of owning their very own wolf pup will never become a reality, but one U.S. artist may have come up with the next best thing.

Pictured in a range of poses, artist Lee Cross, 21, creates frighteningly realistic handmade animal cubs that are so lifelike they have even fooled people into thinking they are real.

Inspired by the Alaskan wildlife that surrounded her childhood home, she turns some of the cutest creatures around, such as wolf pups, baby otters and baby pandas, into bizarre looking dolls.

Once completed, the baby animal sculptures are then sold on Lee Cross' ebay account for hundreds of dollars

Wolf pup sculptures such as this normally sell from anywhere between $800 (£475) and $5000 (£3000)

Having never attended a single art class, she is entirely self taught and combines sculpture, synthetic fur and stuffing wrapped around a posable skeleton to produce the bizarre-looking soft toys.

She also paints white beads to make the eyes as true to life as possible, hand dyes the fur and even adds weights to create the sensation of holding a real life animal.

After spending the last eight years perfecting her craft, she has now started a worldwide phenomenon and receives hundreds to thousands of requests from people wanting to buy her sculptures everyday.

In an effort to keep up with demand, the creations are auctioned on her aptly named 'eBay Auction Adoptions' page, where fans pay anything from $800 (£475) to $5000 (£3000) to purchase their very own creepy critter.

She said: 'Since I grew up in the woods of Alaska, I would see wild animals every day.

The sculptures initially took weeks to make but are now created much quicker. Pictured is a baby otter

Demand for the sculptures - such as this wolf pup - has skyrocketed with orders coming from across the world

The animals are available for purchase from Lee Cross on what she has aptly named 'ebay Auction Adoptions'

'Whether it was a family of eagles nesting right outside my window, wild swans that lived on our lake that became so used to me being there, they would come when I called and let me pet them or even the moose that would eat the carrot noses off my snowmen. I wanted to sculpt the animals I was seeing.

'This is what inspired me to create animals as realistic as I experienced them in life.

'Each animal varies on how long it takes to make, when I first started it took weeks and weeks working all day.

'But it does not take as long now that I've made over 400 animals, it's become muscle memory.

'However, because every single animal is made with such care and attention, it still takes a very long while.

'I had no artistic ability at all until I turned 13 and I've never had any lessons of any kind.

Lee Cross realised there was a demand for her baby animal creations when her first sculpture won an art competition and then sold the very same day. Pictured is a baby cheetah

Lee Cross, 21, originally from Alaska, pictured working on her latest baby animal creation. She said she felt 'incredibly blessed' the animal creations had brought such 'joy and excitement' to so many people

'This was when I made my first animal sculpture, it didn't have the synthetic fur or posable skeleton but it won in an art contest and even sold the same day.

'I receive hundreds to thousands of commission requests every day, and due to the mass, I only sell these creatures through what I call 'eBay Auction Adoptions' where I let the people decide what each one-of-a-kind animal is worth.

'When I first started making these animals purely for my own delight, I had no idea they would erupt practically over night as a world wide 'must have', I was so shocked and it was a little overwhelming.

'My animals have also been noticed by the film company Stan Winston's Studios, who are the makers of the Jurassic Park movie, as well as the film company Weta Workshop who are the creators of Lord of the Rings, Narnia and The Hobbit.

'I just feel incredibly blessed that these animals have brought such joy and excitement to so many.'
