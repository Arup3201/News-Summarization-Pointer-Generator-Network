David Cameron promised a 'better time ahead' as he acknowledged today that families are suffering difficult times due to the uncertain economic situation.

The Prime Minister said the Government is taking action where it can to help keep families' bills down, citing Chancellor George Osborne's announcement yesterday of a one-year council tax freeze.

But he insisted that he would stick to the deficit reduction package of cuts and tax rises.

David Cameron left the conference hotel with MP Nicky Morgan this morning to give interviews in which he said he understood the financial difficulties faced by families

Speaking at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, the Prime Minister also warned that interest rates would
rise if the international money markets lost confidence that Britain 
was paying off its debts.

'The whole message of this conference is that we know things are difficult, we know families face difficult times right now, but we have got to show the leadership to make the right decisions and get us through this difficult time and get to a better time ahead,' he told ITV1's Daybreak.

'I completely understand that families today do see the prices at the petrol pump high, food prices have gone up. Many people, particularly in the public sector, have had their pay frozen.

'I understand the difficulty people are going through, so the council tax freeze is helpful because that is one bill that is not going up.

'All the time, we are looking to see is there spare money we can use to help Britain's families get through what is a difficult time.'

Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'People are very worried about future job prospects, and this Government has got to do everything we can to reassure them that the difficult decisions we are taking, and I believe they are necessary, are in the long-term interest of the country.'

The PM insisted it was 'completely unfair' to say the Tories were supporting the rich.

'Overall
the richest 10 per cent are going to pay 10 times more tax than the 
poorest. I think this is a fair way to reduce the deficit.'

Calling for responsibility at the top of society, Mr Cameron backed Mr Osborne's plan to tackle tax avoidance.

The Prime Minister repeated his Chancellor's vow that the Tories would not be moved from its deficit reduction plan

'I want responsibility from people at the top as well as at the bottom and paying your taxes is a key responsibility.'

Mr
Cameron rejected the idea that the government had found more than £1billion for extra spending commitments 'down the back of the sofa'.

And
he defended using the money to fund weekly bin collections and a 
council tax freeze rather than cutting the deficit more quickly.

'When a government is spending around £700billion a year it is perfectly possible, through good financial management, to find savings and underspends and use that money wisely,' he said.

'With bin collections, I think a lot of families in this country would say "Look, the one service I get from my district council is the bin collection and I really would like them to collect the smelly food waste once a week".

'I think that is a thing you should expect in a civilised country.

'I think that is a good use of money by (Communities Secretary) Eric Pickles, I think the use of money to freeze council tax is a good use of money.'

Mr Cameron said it was possible to take action on 'people's priorities' because the Government had been 'very tough on its own costs'.

Mr Cameron said he did not believe the Government should intervene to stop bonuses or put a cap on pay in the banking sector.

He told the Today programme: 'On the question of bonuses, if there is a bank entirely in the private sector, I want to see responsible behaviour and I want to see us regulating properly, but we can't determine the pay structure in every single organisation. That wouldn't be the right thing to do.

'Companies do need to attract and retain and recruit good staff. I am not opposed to the idea of bonuses. I used to work in business, I used to employ staff and negotiate bonuses with people.

'A bonus on top of what you earn to reward hard work and good behaviour is part of what happens in corporate life and that's entirely right.'

Mr Cameron said Labour leader Ed Miliband had gone 'off the rails' in his conference in Liverpool last week when he proposed using tax and regulation to support good business practices and penalise bad ones.

'Where I think Ed goes off the rails is the idea that the Chancellor of the Exchequer can sit there and say there is one tax rate for this company and another tax rate for that company.

Mr Cameron said that Ed Miliband had gone 'off the rails' at the Labour Party conference when he proposed using tax and regulation to support good business practices and penalise bad ones

'It is completely impractical and that is why the business response to the Labour conference was so negative, because they thought 'Heavens above, we are trying to grow an economy and get more people working and we need investment and jobs. What on earth is this guy talking about?''

Mr Cameron challenged Mr Miliband's claim that Labour was opposed to the culture of 'something for nothing' in British society.

'I have been saying for five years that if you put into society you should get out of society,' he said. 'If you do the right thing, bring up your children, work hard and try to take a role in your community, you should be able to look back on a life and say 'I did the right thing and it was worth it'.

'The tragedy in our country today is too many people who do the right thing think it's not worth it because actually they get punished for that good behaviour, rather than rewarded.

'What I found rather staggering about the Labour conference is that they don't seem to understand that the massive budget deficit they built up was a something-for-nothing deficit.

'The fact that they haven't tackled all these people on welfare who for years have been able to stay on welfare even though they could work - that was a something-for-nothing culture.

'The words are great, but what matters in government is are you doing the things to back them up.'

Mr Cameron insisted that the Government was following its mantra that 'we are all in this together' in paying down the deficit.

'I don't accept this is a Government that has one rule at the top and one rule at the bottom,' he said.

'We are absolutely asking people at the top of our society to be responsible and we are completely dissatisfied about the way the banking industry behaved over the last decade.'
