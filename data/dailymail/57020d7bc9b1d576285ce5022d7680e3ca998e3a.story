With sweeping curtains, a chandelier and luxurious sofas, this was once the home of a seemingly well-to-do family in Syria.

But now it is a place of killing, where a  rebel sniper was pictured taking aim from the window as his comrades casually lounge around.

The richly-decorated house is in the city of Aleppo, where constant fighting between government forces and rebels is tearing apart the lives of normal citizens.

Camouflaged members of the Free 
Syrian Army are holding positions around Syria's second city to defend 
it from an assault by troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.

But most of the fighters aren't holed up in such comfortable surroundings, and are instead taking cover in the rubble of their shell-hit city. The civil war has now been raging for 18 months and nearly 20,000 people have been killed - most of them civilians.

Today, U.N. human rights investigators accused Syrian government forces and allied shabbiha militia of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder and torture.

The rebels have also committed war crimes but these 'did not reach the gravity, frequency and scale' of those carried out by the army and security forces, they said.

'The commission found reasonable grounds to believe that government forces and the shabbiha had committed the crimes against humanity of murder and of torture, war crimes and gross violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, including unlawful killing, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, sexual violence, indiscriminate attack, pillaging and destruction of property,' said the 102-page report by the independent investigators led by Paulo Pinheiro.

Both government forces and armed insurgents had violated rights of children during the 17-month-old conflict, it said.

Karen AbuZayd, an American expert 
serving as senior investigator alongside Pinheiro, said: 'We have 
identified both parties as guilty of war crimes and of course a greater 
number and of bigger variety from the government side.

'What happened on the government side
appears to be a policy of the state. It is not just widespread but 
similar large-scale complex operations, how they are carried out, the 
way the military and security work together,' she said.

Completing their inquiry into a 
massacre in Houla north of Homs in late May, the investigators said on 
Wednesday that government forces and Shabbiha fighters were responsible 
for the killings of more than 100 civilians, nearly half of them 
children.

The investigators said they would 
update their confidential list of suspects or units responsible for 
violations and hand it over to U.N. rights boss Navi Pillay next month.

In Aleppo today, Syrian air force missiles 
struck a hospital in a rebel-held area of the city wounding one person, a
doctor there said, and Human Rights Watch called it was an attack in 
violation of international law.

Reuters saw at least two gaping holes
in the walls and major damage to four floors of the Al Shifaa Hospital 
which was hit on Tuesday.

'If we had lingered just another five
minutes, we would have died,' said the doctor who identified himself as
Dr Younes. He said he had been performing an operation on the fifth 
floor just minutes before the attack. He was smeared with blood from 
treating four patients for shrapnel wounds.

There had been 15 patients in the hospital at the time of the attack, all of whom were transferred elsewhere, he said.

Dust covered hospital beds, 
incubators were broken, and the floor was scattered with rubble. Water 
from a broken tank had gathered on the hospital floor, mixing with 
patches of blood.

Dr Younes said 90 per cent of 
patients received by the hospital were civilians who needed treatment 
either for shrapnel or bullet wounds. 'The actual team of doctors who 
worked at this hospital have all left and they've been replaced by us, 
volunteers,' he said.

Citing hospital staff interviewed at 
the scene, Human Rights Watch said no opposition fighters had been 
deployed at the hospital at the time of two attacks that had targeted it
on August 12 and August 14, and only several armed hospital guards were
providing security.

'On the fourth floor of the hospital,
Human Rights Watch saw the tail remnants from about a dozen S-5 
rockets. These rockets are fired from aircraft with a range of two to 
three miles,' it said in a statement.

The Russian-made S-5 is an unguided 
rocket originally developed in the 1950s. Though still in production, it
is not noted for its accuracy.

'All hospitals, whether civilian or 
military, are specially protected under international humanitarian law, 
known as the laws of war. They may not be targeted, even if being used 
to treat enemy fighters,' Human Rights Watch said.

Under the Geneva Conventions 
hospitals remain protected unless they are 'used to commit hostile acts'
that are outside their humanitarian function, it added.

'Hospitals, doctors, and ambulances 
should never be attacked,' said Ole Solvang, emergencies researcher at 
Human Rights Watch. 'In Aleppo, the Syrian government has flouted this 
principle of international law.'Â 

In the capital Damascus, Syria's state TV reported today
that a bomb attached to a fuel truck has exploded outside a hotel where
UN observers are staying in the Syrian capital, wounding at 
least three people.

The station said the explosion took 
place near a parking lot used by the army command, which is about 300 
yards away. None of the wounded were believed to be UN staff.

But according to an Associated Press 
reporter at the scene, the blast had gone off inside a different parking
lot belonging to a military compound near the Dama Rose Hotel, popular 
with the UN observers in Syria.

The hotel was slightly damaged in the
blast, with some of its windows shattered. A Labour Union building 
across from the hotel was also damaged and black smoke was seen 
billowing into the sky before the fire was extinguished. UN officials in
Damascus had no immediate comment.

Damascus has been hit by a wave of 
explosions in the past months and clashes between government troops and 
rebels have also recently reached the capital, which had been relatively
quiet since the uprising against President Assad's regime started in 
March last year.

Meanwhile, Iran is playing a growing 
role supporting the Syrian regime and is helping to build and train a 
militia to fight opposition forces, U.S. defence chiefs have said.

General Martin Dempsey, chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Pentagon reporters that the militia, 
generally made up of Syrian Shiite forces, was being used to take the 
pressure off the Syrian regime forces.

'Any army would be taxed with that 
kind of pace,' Gen Dempsey said. 'They are having resupply problems, 
they are having morale problems, they are having the kind of wear and 
tear that would come of being in a fight for as long as they have.'

Gen Dempsey also said that it 
appeared Syrian rebels were able to shoot down a warplane, but said he 
had seen no indication that they were yet armed with heavy weapons or 
surface-to-air missiles.

He said the MiG fighter could have 
been shot down with small arms fire. Syria has blamed the crash on a 
technical malfunction, but Gen Dempsey said the cause 'didn't appear to 
be mechanical'.

Gen Dempsey and defence secretary 
Leon Panetta voiced concerns about Iran's growing presence in Syria, 
even as President Assad's regime steps up its aerial attacks against the
rebel forces.
