Driving has been blamed for making many people lazy.

So Italian engineers at Italdesign Giugiaro have teamed up with Audi and Technogym to get car owners to exercise when they’re stuck in traffic.

The result is a high-end self-driving electric car with basic gym equipment built into the seats and floor, a fridge for drinks and a Wellness mode.

Italdesign Giugiaro has created the world’s first autonomous electric car with gym equipment built into the seats and floor. Two handles are fitted into the rear seats and pop out of their compartment at the press of a button. For lower limbs, two flat boards designed by Technogym have been fitted to the floor

The concept model is called Gea and was presented at Geneva's 85th International Motor Show this week. It is dubbed 'the future of luxury mobility.'

It has so-called 'book-type' doors that can be opened remotely and beam a red carpet from the car onto the floor. 

Two aluminium handles designed by Technogym are fitted into the rear seats.

By activating a sensor, the handles pop out of the compartment and can be used for upper body routines.

Senzati recently unveiled its luxuriously modified Jet Sprinter van.

Its layout and features, such as the colour of the seats, can be customised. 

It boasts a 6.5ft (two metre) sunroof, luxury bathroom, office, fridge and entertainment system - among other features - depending on the specification.

The vehicle was built by Coventry-based Senzati and is based on Mercedes’ Sprinter van, sometimes used by tradesmen.

It set out to design a vehicle to provide passengers with ‘the space uniquely found in a decent sized private jet’ that is able to be manoeuvred in cities and be discrete from the exterior.

The vehicle starts at £209,000 ($318,000) and is made to look discrete from the outside.  

For lower limbs, two flat boards have been fitted to the floor. 

These can be made to be raised and used for stepping exercises.

And a built-in monitor displays a video tutorial of Technogym exercise routines to help the user vary their workouts.

There is also room between the seats for a small fridge where drinks  can be stored.

And at the top to this compartment, a small drawer contains cosmetics and a perfumed pouch for aromatherapy.

Elsewhere, when the driver selects Wellness mode dashboard LED lights turn to amber to create a ‘warmer, more relaxing atmosphere’.

A Business mode turns the Gea into a mobile office with two 19-inch screens that drop from the roof to let passengers choose what information is shown.

The front passenger seat can also turn through 180 degrees to hold meetings on the move.

And in Dream mode the front seats join and fold-out to add a footrest, while the right rear seat can turn into a fully flat bed. 

LEDs project a relaxing blue light, the windows darken and  pictures of galaxies and starry skies appear on the monitors and on the front dashboard.

All of these lighting systems are based on Audi laserlight and LED technology. 

The red G icon of the manufacturer fitted on the rear of the car is illuminated and is fitted with a camera that serves as both a rear-view mirror and a parking assistant.

The car reaches a top speed of 155mph (250 km/h) and is powered by four motors, but there are no immediate plans to launch a consumer model of the luxurious car. 

Wolfgang Egger, Head of Styling Area of Italdesign Giugiaro said: 'Gea is not simply a car, we wanted to give shape to our vision of luxury mobility for the future'.
