When comedienne Joan Rivers first saw her Connecticut house, it was no laughing matter – she hated it.

And now, having had the estate completely revamped at great cost, she’s gone and sold it.

The house, in rural New Preston, was reportedly bought for $4.4 million.

According to the County Times, the new owners wish to remain anonymous. But whoever they are, they’ve bought a remarkable property.

Ms Rivers, who's moved to California, had the place completely rebuilt after she bought it in 2000, having described it as looking like a popular fast-food outlet to Architectural Digest.

The 80-year-old told the publication: ‘This was the ugliest house I’d ever seen. It looked like a Denny’s, by a student of Frank Lloyd Wright’s who didn’t study hard enough.’

The luxury property had been on and off the market since 2009

However, she was much happier with her home once retail executive Joe Cicio and architect Michael Boe had worked their magic.

Following the revamp, Architectural Digest describe the property as being ‘a 5,000-square-foot house featuring 22-foot-high ceilings, 100-year-old chestnut beams, four wood-burning fireplaces, skylights and a massive country kitchen’.

It added: ‘The living room, spacious enough to hold twin 10-foot-long custom-made sofas, is a festival of light, thanks to nine French doors, six of which open onto the free-form stone terrace that hugs the back of the house and abuts a lush expanse of lawn leading to the pool and poolhouse.’

The luxury property had been on and off the market since 2009. Some may wonder why it took quite so long to be sold.

The entertainer pocketed even more from the sale of her Manhattan penthouse, which according to Street Easy, went for $29.5 million earlier this year.
