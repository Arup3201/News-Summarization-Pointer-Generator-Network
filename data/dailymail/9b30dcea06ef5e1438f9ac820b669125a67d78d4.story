A Minnesota cop decapitated a boy's pet chicken and in a cruel mistake left the head outside the coop, where the owner's mother later found it.

Atwater Police Chief Trevor Berger beat and killed the chicken with a shovel at the home of Ashley Turnbull on August 16 after a neighbor complained about the fowl.

'I came home to find the chicken’s head lying in front of its coop,' Turnbull told the Star Tribune. 'No note left on the door. He just left the head.'

Family pet: Ashley Turnbull says her son, five-year-old Phoenix, treated his chicken, Carson Petey, as if it were a puppy

The
 small red hen, named Carson Petey, belonged to Turnbull's son Phoenix. 
The boy would shuttle the it around the yard in a toy wagon, according 
to Turnbull, who told Minnesota Public Radio, 'the chicken was like a puppy dog to my son.'

According
 to police reports, a neighbor repeatedly complained about a 'chicken on
 the loose' and said a hen wandered into a residential area near an 
elementary school.

It was not clear if Carson Petey was the offending chicken.

Turnbull
 was asked earlier in August to remove three hens and two ducks that she
 and her fiancé gave Phoenix for his birthday, as the animals are 
prohibited by city ordinance.

Berger
 found no one at Turnbull's home when he visited to follow up. Carson 
Petey was outside of its coop and Berger spent 10 or 15 minutes trying 
to corral it, he told Fox 9.

Berger then 'dispatched' the hen with a shovel.

Turnbull
 filed a formal complaint against Berger, claiming trespassing and 
animal cruelty, but she and her son accepted his apology during a 
personal visit Tuesday night.

Cut down: Phoenix Turnbull lost his pet hen when an officer responded to complaints about about a 'chicken on the loose'

'I feel absolutely horrible,' said Berger, who says he didn't know the chicken was a pet. 'I never meant for this to happen.'

The Atwater City Council will meet Wednesday night to address the issue and discuss whether to amend the city ordinance prohibiting fowl.
