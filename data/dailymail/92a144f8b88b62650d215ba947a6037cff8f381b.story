A grandfather who suffered a heart attack in a hospital car park died after being driven 14 miles to a different hospital.

Charlie Hall, 67, had been for a routine CT scan at the University Hospital of Hartlepool when he was taken ill immediately afterwards and collapsed outside.

His wife, Doreen, 59, says she was surprised when the nurses who rushed out and performed CPR on Mr Hall - who was slumped in his car and not breathing - called paramedics.

They then treated him in an ambulance.

When paramedics managed to get Mr Hall breathing again, they took him to the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton, over 14 miles away.

A spokesman for the North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust told MailOnline: ‘Mr Hall needed urgent emergency care which is provided at the University Hospital of North Tees.’

Grandfather-of-four Mr Hall was in a coma for five days and died on November 25.

His widow, from Peterlee in County Durham, said: ‘I am just devastated. I want to know why he wasn’t taken back into the hospital. The whole family are in shock.

‘He went in there fit and healthy; he even drove to the hospital himself. I just can’t get my head around it.

‘It was supposed to be his 68th birthday on Sunday but he is not here to see it. I have got nothing to celebrate now.

‘I am very angry. I think there are a lot of questions that need answering. I have asked for an investigation and filed a formal complaint.

David Emerton, Medical Director for North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘We've got every sympathy with the family and appreciate that this has been a very difficult time for them.

‘We are in discussion with the family and we will do everything we can to address their concerns.’

Mrs Hall has since been told that her husband, who had two children from a previous relationship and was a stepfather of three, was suffering from heart disease and pneumonia.

‘Charlie was due to get his results from the hospital two days after he died but obviously he didn’t live long enough to find out,’ she said.

Mrs Hall, who was married to her husband for 23 years, added: ‘‘I have since found out that he suffered from heart disease. But he could have lived for another three or four years.

‘I think he would have survived if he had been taken straight back into the hospital.’

Mr Hall originally visited the hospital because of the niggling pain in his hip.

The retired pit miner underwent a series of tests including an X-ray, an MRI scan, a chest X-ray and a full body bone scan.

His widow believes he should never have been discharged straight after his latest CT scan.

‘After the scan, two nurses walked him up the corridor and he couldn’t breathe,’ she said.

‘But rather than phone a doctor they left him in the waiting room and carried on with the next person.

‘We waited a few minutes until he could get his breathing back before leaving the hospital.

‘I think he should have been kept him in for observations or at least have somebody on standby.

‘They knew he was struggling to breathe so why did they let him leave the hospital?’

Mr Hall’s death certificate said his death is as a result of heart disease.

North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust has confirmed it is carrying out an investigation into the circumstances of the death.
