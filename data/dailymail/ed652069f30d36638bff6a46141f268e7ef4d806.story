Police officers are today appealing for help to identify a shopper who died after stabbing herself in the neck in the aisle of a supermarket in Shipley.

It is thought the woman was shopping at the ASDA branch when she inflicted the fatal wound to her neck.

West Yorkshire Police said a 'number of inquiries' have been carried out to try and identify the woman, who is Asian and is believed to be aged between 20 and 40 years old.

Tragic: A woman has died after stabbing herself in the neck in the hardware aisle at a branch of ASDA in Shipley, West Yorkshire

Shock: The victim, who is said to be of Asian appearance, was found lying in an aisle after injuring herself in the neck

Victim: The woman is said to be aged between 20 and 40 years old, and was dressed in traditional clothing. She had shoulder-length dark hair that was tied back in a ponytail

She is described as having shoulder-length dark hair which was tied in a ponytail and was wearing a dark blue top and trousers with large silver buttons to the front and a lighter blue or purple scarf.

Detective Inspector Ryan Bragg, of Bradford CID, said: 'We have tried various means to identify this woman but as yet have not been able to do so.

'I would urge anyone who believes they may know the identity of this woman or who has concerns for a family member of friend who fits this description to make contact immediately.'

One eye-witness said: 'One of the shop's first aiders was trying to give CPR.

'One of the young men who works there actually saw the woman stabbing herself in the throat. He's in terrible shock.

'Staff told me the woman had come in with a Polish woman and while her friend was at the bakery, she'd stabbed herself.

'Apparently the Polish woman is a regular customer. She was driven off by police.'

The store was cordoned off for the majority of today as police forensic teams scour the scene and interview staff and witnesses before examining CCTV.

Cordon: West Yorkshire Police have closed the store while forensic officers examine the scene and detectives interview staff members and witnesses. They will also be scouring the CCTV at the store to establish what happened

First aid: Trained members of staff at the Shipley branch rushed to give the woman CPR but a police spokesman said she was pronounced dead at the scene

Not suspicious: The police spokesman said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death

The store reopened at around 3pm - but all the knives from the kitchenware aisle where the woman died had been removed from the shelves.

A shopper said: 'They opened the doors bang on 3pm. They took the police tape down and let a few people in. There was really only a little old lady and her husband waiting.'

West Yorkshire Police were alerted at around 8.37am to the store, along with paramedics.

A spokesman for the police force said the woman was pronounced dead at the scene.

He said officers are not looking for anyone else in connection with her death.

Det Insp Bragg, said: 'Officers were called to the Asda supermarket in Shipley following a report of a woman inside the premises with serious injuries.

'The woman was pronounced dead at the scene.

'There are not believed to be any suspicious circumstances and no one else is being sought in connection with the incident. Enquiries are ongoing.'

Witness: One shopper, in the store at the time, said: 'One of the shop's first aiders was trying to give CPR. One of the young men who works there actually saw the woman stabbing herself in the throat. He's in terrible shock'

Condolences: A spokesman for Asda said: 'We are aware of an incident in our Shipley store this morning and our thoughts are with the individual's family at this time. Our priority at this time is looking after our colleagues and supporting the police in their investigation'
