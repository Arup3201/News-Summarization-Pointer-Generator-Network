To millions of Christians, they are a symbol of peace.

But to a pair of larger birds, the two doves released in the Vatican yesterday were nothing more than a chance for a bit of Sunday morning sport.

No sooner had the birds been set free in St Peter’s Square – as a symbolic gesture of peace for Ukraine – than they were set upon by a seagull and a crow.

The two larger birds swooped on the 
defenceless doves during the Pope’s weekly Sunday Angelus prayer in 
front of tens of thousands of worshippers gathered in the Vatican.

After
 saying a prayer for Ukraine, where at least three people were killed 
during the latest clashes that have seen Kiev in flames, the Pontiff 
helped schoolchildren release the doves from the window of the Apostolic
 Palace as a peace gesture.

But they were immediately attacked. The seagull pinned one 
of the doves against the wall of the palace and pecked at its tail, but 
was left with a mouthful of feathers as its victim made an escape.

The
 crow caught the smaller bird unawares, as it rested on a windowsill, 
before pecking at it repeatedly.  Again, the victim managed to get away.

Eventually both doves flew off, seemingly uninjured, to the relief of tens of thousands of onlookers.

The release of the birds concludes the Vatican’s annual  Caravan of Peace event.

Last year one of the doves was set upon by a gull, while in 2012 they simply flew back into the Apostolic Apartments.

While speaking at the window 
beforehand, Francis had appealed for peace in Ukraine, after at least 
three people were killed during the latest clashes in the two-month 
crisis.

Police and 
demonstrators in Kiev fought again as protests against President Viktor 
Yanukovich's abrupt turn away from the European Union towards Russia, 
Ukraine's former Soviet overlord.

‘I
 am close to Ukraine in prayer, in particular to those who have lost 
their lives in recent days and to their families,’ Francis said in his 
weekly Angelus in St Peter's Square.

‘I
 hope that a constructive dialogue between the institutions and civil 
society can take place, that any resort to violence is avoided and that 
the spirit of peace and a search for the common good is in the hearts of
 all.’

The mass rallies 
against President Yanukovich's rule erupted last November after he 
pulled out of a free trade deal with the European Union in favour of 
closer economic ties with Russia.

They have since spiralled into protests against misrule and corruption among Ukraine's leaders and officials.

There
 have been violent clashes with police in Kiev city centre, resulting in
 the death of three protesters last week, two from gunshot wounds.
