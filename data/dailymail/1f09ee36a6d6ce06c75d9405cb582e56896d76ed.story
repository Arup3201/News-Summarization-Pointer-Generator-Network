After waiting 31 years for the man who raped and murdered her daughter to face justice, mother Nola Mahon had a message for him as he was finally sentenced in a California courtroom.

'I forgive you,' she told Gregory Seamons, who had pled guilty to charges of manslaughter and rape in the March 1983 murder of 11-year-old Rebecca Lemberger.

'Not for his sake, but for ours,' Mahon said as family and friends around her broke into tears. 

Gregory Seamons confessed to the rape and murder of 11-year-old Rebecca Lemberger after DNA evidence tied him to the scene

Seamons was sentenced to serve a 1-15 year prison term and a 5 years to life prison term, The Standard-Examiner reported.

Seamons, 46, raped and murdered the girl when he was 15-years-old. 

Lemberger was missing for one day before her body was found. She had been beaten to death with a rock near a shed in Ogden.

The case was cold until July 2011 when DNA evidence from the crime scene was found to match Seamons.

His sentences will run concurrently with a sentence he is already serving in Idaho State Prison for a 2007 kidnapping conviction.

Once his sentence in Idaho is complete, he will serve rest of his time in Utah State Prison.

His defense team made a plea deal with the prosecution in the case reducing a murder charge to manslaughter.

As the case had been dormant for years and as Seamons was a minor at the time of the crime, Prosecutor Chris Shaw said he was comfortable with the deal.

And as sentence was handed down Mahon was there to address the court.

Rebecca's mother, Nola Mahon, said she forgave Seamons because of her religious faith

'When
 this happened, my brain wouldn't accept what was going on,' she said.
'I had been praying that she was at a friend's house. When the 
realization hit, for 29 years I suspected everybody. I suspected family,
 friends and neighbors. I felt so ashamed.'

Her own father, who survived Nazi-occupied Holland, was brokenhearted at the end of his life over Rebecca's death.

'I understand you were 15 years old,' she told Seamons. 'I don't understand why, but I forgive you.'

After she was finished, Judge Mark DeCarla was shaken and moved by the gesture.

'This case has been on the minds of the community for 30 years and has been a part of my entire career,' he said. 'I cannot understand how you 
can look this man in the eye and say you forgive him, but I appreciate 
that.'

Rebecca's sister, Cindy Hawke, also spoke remembering the happy girl that had been taken from them.

'She was 
our 'Boo Boo bear'. She was a bundle of joy and she loved everybody,' she said. 'When I got that call that she wasn't coming home, it turned
 my world upside down.'

Hawke noted that may of Rebecca's classmates are now adults. They were so hurt by her death they formed a Facebook group to keep in touch over the years. Several attended court for the sentencing.

Hearing Maho's words, Seamons began to cry.

'I've
 thought about it for a long time, and these tears are too late. Nothing
 I can do can fix this,' Seamons told the court. 'I don't expect the family's 
forgiveness.'

He also hoped this would finally clear the name of his late father, Larry Bingham Seamons, who he had blamed for the murder in several letters to the media.

'I've recommitted 
myself to God,' Seamons said. 'I'm not afraid of what Judge DeCaria can do to
 me, I'm afraid of what God will do with me.'

As Mahon did not seek financial restitution the case was finally closed.

'I'm glad to finally get closure, but I can never fully put it behind me,' she said.

She credited her faith for allowing her to find forgiveness.

'I felt sorry for him. I realized I could forgive him 
because of what awaits him on the other side if he does not repent.' she said.
