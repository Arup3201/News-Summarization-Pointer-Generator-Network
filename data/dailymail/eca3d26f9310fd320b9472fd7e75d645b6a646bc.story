Princess Beatrice is fast becoming the Royal Family's most enthusiastic gourmand, sampling London's finest culinary haunts night after night.

Last night, the 25-year-old was spotted leaving Roka Mayfair, the upmarket haunt by Rainer Becker, creator and founder of Zuma, Roka and, most recently, Oblix at The Shard.

In the last few months, she's visited the Chiltern Firehouse, Zuma, Nobu, Restaurant C, Balthazar, La Petite Maison, Les Trois Garcons and China Tang - it's a veritable roll-call of the capital's hottest dining destinations.

Out AGAIN? Princess Beatrice loves to dine out and last night saw her enjoying the Japanese culinary delights of Roka in Mayfair 

Last night's choice Roka is best known for its Japanese Robatayaki cuisine, but also serves up fresh sushi, sashimi and salads.

Dishes include grilled lobster hot pot with crab miso butter and mitsuba, as well as rock shrimp, wasabi pea seasoning and chilli mayonnaise - although the website doesn't reveal the prices. Never encouraging if your means are more limited than Princess Bea's.

The night before: Princess Beatrice enjoyed date night with her long-term boyfriend Dave Clark at exclusive Mayfair restaurant, La Petite Masion on Tuesday night

Beatrice appeared in good spirits as she left the restaurant wearing a waist-cinching black dress with an Aztec-print jacket.

Beatrice looked fresh-faced despite a late night the evening before, which saw her and long-term boyfriend Dave Clarke enjoying a low-key evening at La Petite Maison, a French restaurant in the heart of Mayfair.

The flame-haired royal, who is making a name for herself as quite the fashionista,
 looked sophisticated and chic in a fitted black dress, which she teamed
 with a tailored monochrome blazer.

Writing about the restaurant, a Square Meal reviewer writes: 'If you're pining for the Côte d'Azur, or neighbouring Liguria, you might consider heading over to La Petite Maison, which aims to capture some of that region's gastronomic spirit.'

The menu features tender grilled veal 
chops, lamb cutlets with smoked aubergine and whole sea bream cooked en 
papillote with lemon and herbs.

Who knew they were friends? Beatrice was last 
week joined by long-term boyfriend David Clark a meal with Jimmy Carr 
and his partner Karoline Copping

In one of 
the more surprising buddy-ups of recent times, Princess Beatrice enjoyed a 
double date last Wednesday with funny man Jimmy Carr.

The two apparent pals dined out at exclusive London restaurant Zuma with their other halves.

Beatrice
was joined by long-term boyfriend David Clark for the meal, while Jimmy
was accompanied by his partner Karoline Copping.

Zuma in London's upmarket Knightsbridge is another of Becker's restaurants and describes itself as 'offering something completely new - a sophisticated twist on the traditional japanese izakaya style of informal eating and drinking. 

Dishes
 include seared, miso marinated foie gras with umeboshi compote and 
moromi miso marinated baby chicken, oven roasted on cedar wood. Yet 
again, the website states no prices.

She loves a night out! Princess Beatrice seems to be an unofficial restaurant reviewer and has visited the trendiest restaurants that London has to offer, such as The Chiltern Firehouse, right

Two weeks ago, she was 
seen strolling hand-in-hand with Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas as 
they enjoyed an evening out at Annabel's - a very exclusive private members club.

The week before that, at the end of April, she enjoyed a romantic night out at celebrity hotspot, The Chiltern Firehouse, which she has visited a few times in recent weeks.

'Firehouse', as it is called (or hashtagged) by those who get to dine within its very exclusive confines, is the latest offering from hip hotelier André Balazs. The past fortnight alone has seen the likes of Tony Blair, Orlando Bloom, Lily Allen and Kate Moss dine there.

Chiltern 
Firehouse is part of the group owned by renowned hotelier André Balazs' 
collection of bespoke, luxury hotels which include celebrity favourites The Mercer in Soho, 
New York, Chateau Marmont in Hollywood and Sunset Beach in Shelter 
Island plus The Hamptons.

Starters
 include sea trout crudo, yellow mole, coriander (£11) and steak 
tartare, pine nuts, chipotle and Firehouse hot sauce (£12), while main 
courses include blackened salmon, sea kale, crispy skin and trout roe 
(£24) and pan-roasted chicken, charred leek heart, mustard tops (£26).

Princess Beatrice and Sarah Ferguson enjoyed two mother-daughter dates in a week.

The
 royal pair were seen leaving glamorous 45 Park Lane Hotel restaurant in
 Mayfair in April, having enjoyed another gourmet dinner.

While
 most of us have to curtail nights out during the week, or risk falling 
asleep at our desks, the 25-year-old royal is lucky enough not to have 
to get up for work in the morning.

The dinner marked the third time that Beatrice had hit the town that week. On the Wednesday night, Sarah Ferguson and 
Princess Beatrice were joined by her ex-husband the Duke of York for dinner
 at smart Mayfair restaurant ‘Restaurant C’ while the Friday before, Beatrice 
was seen leaving the Chiltern 
Firehouse (again), where she had been dining with friends.

In mid-April,  Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew dined with their daughter in London's 
fashionable East End.

The happy trio had a quiet family supper at the fashionable Les Trois Garcons on Bethnal Green Road.

It was an unusual choice for the group - edgy Shoreditch, although gentrified, isn’t yet a royal stamping ground.

Les 
Trois Garcons is a former pub decorated with stuffed animals and 
dangling handbags, and serves up dishes such as £25 dish of poached 
ballotine of chicken and lobster, and a £21.50 organic salmon with 
spinach, potato Dauphine, and a champagne butter sauce.

Around Valentine's Day, the Princess enjoyed a night out with boyfriend Dave Clark at famous Mayfair restaurant Nobu.

A
 notorious celebrity hangout, the young royal was at Nobu at the same 
time as singer Ronan Keating and friends but confident Beatrice seemed 
unfazed by the media attention, smiling for the waiting press as she 
exited the pricey restaurant, loved by Cheryl Cole and Victoria Beckham.

Princess Bea must have a penchant for Japanese food, considering that over half of the restaurants she's visited in recent weeks serve sushi and sashmini, perhaps that's how she maintains her trim figure.

While the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge prefer a quiet night in (the royal couple were once spotted buying pizza and salad at their local Sainsburys), at least Princess Beatrice is representing the young royal set, showcasing some serious style credentials and helping support Mayfair's gastronomic economy.
