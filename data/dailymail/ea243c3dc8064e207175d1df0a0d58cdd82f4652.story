Manchester United's players and their families gathered at Carrington on Sunday for a children’s fun day organised by interim manager Ryan Giggs knowing that the party is almost over.

For a number of the squad, Tuesday’s match against Hull City will be their last appearance at Old Trafford. For others, that moment has already passed. Hours later, Louis van Gaal is set to be confirmed as manager and life will never be quite the same again.

If there is one beneficiary beyond Wearside from United’s 1-0 home defeat to Sunderland on Saturday, it’s Van Gaal.

The party is almost over: United's interim manager Ryan Giggs walks off the field looking dejected

Changes: Louis van Gaal is set to be confirmed as United's new manager following Tuesday's clash with Hull 

The last thing the Dutchman needed was 
to come into the job on the back of four straight wins under Giggs and a
 clamour for the Old Trafford icon to be appointed; to see the players 
who let down David Moyes so badly try to save their own skins by 
reminding us why they were at United in the first place.

Instead,
 after Giggs’s opening 4-0 win over Norwich, it was as bad as anything 
we have witnessed this season with United showing a chronic lack of pace
 and ingenuity.

Ashley Young and Nani – who was linked with a 
move to Juventus over the weekend – were wretched, Javier Hernandez once
 again failed to seize his opportunity in the absence through injury of 
Wayne Rooney, while Rio Ferdinand and Darren Fletcher looked well past 
their best.

Afterwards Giggs wore the puzzled look and gave the vague answers that people came to expect from Moyes.

None
 of them are safe from the Van Gaal revolution as he prepares to take a 
£150million wrecking ball to the empire that Sir Alex Ferguson built.

Patrice
 Evra, who is still undecided about his future at Old Trafford, is in no
 doubt that the players are to blame for United’s worst Premier League 
season on record by quite some stretch.

‘It’s not about the 
manager,’ said Evra. ‘You have to take responsibility, every player. The
 young players, the senior players. This year everyone has failed. You 
should be there and it’s been a disaster. A nightmare to forget really 
quickly.

‘You always feel responsible even when David Moyes was 
in charge. When I spoke with him, I put the players before everything 
because we are on the pitch. I never point at anyone else.

Summed it up: Patrice Evra admitted it has proved very difficult without Sir Alex Ferguson this season

‘Sir 
Alex Ferguson was the heart of Manchester United. You cannot replace him
 so quickly and we knew it would be difficult, but not this difficult.

‘We
 can do much better than we have. Maybe not win the league but at least 
qualify for the Champions League with the players we’ve got. We deserve 
all the criticism. We didn’t play well enough. We lost some stupid games
 and that’s why we’re in this position.

‘But I really think it’s an accident. I know Manchester United will never die, and also that we’ll come back next year.’

Rooney
 did some light training over the weekend as he eases his way back from a
 groin strain but it remains to be seen if he will be involved against 
Hull.
