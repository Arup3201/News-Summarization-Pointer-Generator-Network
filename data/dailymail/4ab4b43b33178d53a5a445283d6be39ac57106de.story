Tennis fan Pippa Middleton was spotted in New York today as she attended day nine of the U.S. Open as a guest of Roger Federer.

Wearing a £375 colour block dress by Paper London, accessorised with tan wedges, £120 handmade wooden sunglasses by Finlay & Co and a straw Kate Spade handbag, the 28-year-old stopped to pose for photographers before entering the venue at Flushing Meadows, Queens.

Once inside the courts she promptly took a seat next to dark-haired, 6ft 3in Spencer Vegosen - a Harvard graduate and accomplished tennis player - before watching the women's singles quarterfinals game unfold.

Mr Vegosen, who now resides in New York but is originally from Illinois, Chicago  is a familiar face on the sporting scene and he was once one of the top junior tennis players in the U.S, winning 11 sportsmanship awards. His father Jon is also president of the U.S.Tennis Association.

It is believed Mr Vegosen received a BA in East Asian studies and mathematics from Harvard University and spent last summer working in Hong Kong as an analyst for Goldman Sachs. However it is not known where he currently works.

Since landing in the metropolis on Saturday to attend meetings about her upcoming book, Celebrate: A Year of Festivities for Families and Friends, Pippa  has been snapped with a number of men while sampling some of New York's finer delights.

In
an opulent welcome hotelier Andre Balazs, who is reportedly worth more 
than $450 million, flew her by seaplane - a trip that costs $525 for a 
single journey - to his resort, Sunset Beach, on Shelter Island on 
Sunday.

And later that evening the New York Daily News reported that she was spotted at the Electric Room at Dream Downtown in the Meatpacking district
with former New York Ranger Sean Avery.

'She was only there for a short time,' a source told the paper, adding they were there with Mazdack Rassi, owner of photography company Milk Studios.

It has been suggested that Pippa is staying at the Carlyle Hotel located in the Upper East Side, where Roger Federer also has a suite, with two friends, where rooms start at $600 and reach $15,000 - without taxes.

Her trip, during which she is apparently courting the perks of fame, come despite her demands to remain out of the public gaze.

While newspapers have respected her 
request to be recognised as a private citizen, she still very much seems
to be enjoying the high-flying life of a socialite.

Despite her request, U.S. news sites chose to publish photographs of her
playing table tennis with Balazs over the weekend, but MailOnline has respected her 
wishes.

Fashion pack: It is believed Pippa might make an appearance at New York Fashion
Week

Pippa, who turns 29 on Thursday, is in town for meetings over her new book, which is out on October
30. She will not be holding an publicity events for the book while she 
is here, Viking publishers said.

Billed as a 'comprehensive seasonal guide to simple and creative 
entertaining', it is a book she hopes will cement her credentials as a 
party planner, and industry observers believe it could net her a small 
fortune in the process.

It is believed that Pippa is set to make an appearance at New York's Fashion
Week, which kicks off on September 6.

Pippa Middleton eased into her new role as celebrity author as she partied with New York's finest this weekend.

The
younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge stayed at pricey hotels, 
dined at top restaurants and reportedly flirted with New York's 
wealthiest after arriving in the city on Saturday.

And Pippa, who is in New York for meetings about her upcoming book, has a packed schedule ahead of her - with jaunts to the U.S. Open and hotly-anticipated appearances at New York Fashion Week.

In an opulent welcome, hotelier Andre Balazs flew her by seaplane - a trip that costs $525 for a single journey - to his resort, Sunset Beach, on Shelter Island on Sunday.

Pippa, dressed in tight red jeans and
a white top, laughed as she played pingpong with Balazs, 55, at his 
boutique hotel before they shared dinner, the New York Post reported.

During
her trip to Sunset Beach on Sunday, she rode around in the hotelier's 
VW cream and red van, laughing and snapping photographs with another 
male and three females.

'They were taking pictures and 
popping their heads out of the van, smiling and laughing the whole 
time,' a source told the New York Daily News.

While a witness told Page Six it did not
look like they were a couple, it was 'flirt central', they said. 'There
was definitely chemistry,' the source said. 'Andre was being very 
charming.'

Travelling in style: Pippa and her friends were taken to Balazs' resort at the Hamptons on his seaplane, which costs $525 for a one-way trip or more than $3,200 to commission a personal flight

High life: Pippa and two friends are reportedly staying at The Carlyle Hotel, where rooms start at $600

Another source said that Pippa, whose book Celebrate: A Year of Festivities for Families and Friends comes out in late October, was there to talk business.

'But everyone was speculating what a great romantic pairing this could be,' the source said.

Pippa Middleton arrived in New York City this weekend and has enjoyed the city's more luxurious perks, although it is unclear what exactly she has paid for. Among her expenses:

Balazs,
who is reportedly worth more than $450 million, has been romantically 
linked to actress Uma Thurman and comedian and TV host Chelsea Handler.

Pippa, 28, was dating Alex Loudon, a former England cricketer, for more
than a year, but they split last November - reportedly over the 
attention she was garnering following her sister's marriage.

When
Balazs and Pippa parted ways at the end of the night, he reportedly 
gave her a friendly double kiss on the cheek, witnesses told the New 
York Post.

Pippa then made a trip to the Electric Room at Dream Downtown in the Meatpacking District, where she was seen chatting to former New York Ranger Sean Avery, the New York Daily News reported.

'She was only there for a short time,' a source told the paper, adding they were there with Mazdack Rassi, owner of photography company Milk Studios.

She also reportedly met Gossip Girl actor Chase Crawford, 27, at the bar, with a witness telling Us Weekly the pair 'spoke for 10 minutes'.

The trip to the beach-side resort 
came a day after Pippa and two friends popped by their pricey Upper East
Side hotel, the Carlyle, where rooms fetch as much as $15,000 a night.

They
went to Meatpacking District seafood hotspot Catch, where they enjoyed 
Chef Hung Huynh's rice cakes, crispy shrimp, salmon carpaccio, scallop 
dumplings and sushi, People reported.

Just
over an hour later, Pippa, who was wearing a sleek green dress, went 
for quiet drinks before hailing a cab and returning to the hotel.

There is also speculation that Pippa,
who turns 29 on Thursday, might make an appearance at New York's 
Fashion Week, which started on Monday at the Lincoln Center.

The stylish set are keeping her name 
on any show or party guest lists, should she wish to attend, the New 
York Daily News reported.

name after her sister's wedding, right, last year. Even though she has 
requested privacy from the press, she has put out a new book featuring 
her picture, left

Connections: Pippa with her sister Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, while at Wimbledon earlier this year

The cover's patchwork 
quilt-style design of pictures of Pippa may come as a surprise to some 
readers, however, as Miss Middleton has strongly defended her right to 
privacy in recent years.

Whether
Miss Middleton will be able to maintain her position that she is a 
private citizen following the book's release remains to be seen.

Her
first tome is expected to generate much publicity, and it was reported 
last month that she has negotiated a six-figure book deal with 
publishers Michael Joseph, the branch of the Penguin Group that deals 
with ‘highly commercial’ properties.

Miss
Middleton's book deal has attracted criticism, with some observers 
accusing her of cashing in on her sister Kate's position as a senior 
Royal.
