Cristiano Ronaldo be warned, Ghana’s John Boye has already left two World Cup stars in a bloodied mess.

It was during their Group G opener with USA that Clint Dempsey felt the full force of Boye’s head-high boot.

The reckless challenge left the American dazed, bleeding and stricken on the turf and still he sports a black eye as a reminder of the clash.

Boye, that hurt: Clint Dempsey feels the full force of John Boye's boot

Flat out: Dempsey needed help after Boye's hefty whack

Bloody mess: Dempsey will have a few battle scars after taking one full in the face from Boye

Ouch! Thomas Muller is on the receiving end of Boye's muscular frame

Red alert: A stoppage-time collision with Boye left Muller bloodied and dazed in the 2-2 draw with Ghana

Care: Muller is tended to by team-mate Miroslav Klose following the late clash

Nasty: Muller's bloody palm shows the extent of his injury

Are you ready? Cristiano Ronaldo takes on Boye in Portugal's final group game

USA and Dempsey emerged 2-1 victors, however, and they need just a point against Germany on Thursday to progress.

The Germans will have Thomas Muller in their line-up and he, too, will be wearing the scars of a Boye smash.

The
 forward was on the receiving end of the defender’s shoulder blade 
during their 2-2 draw and, like Dempsey, was left covered in claret and a
 little shaken.

Let’s see what Boye has got in store for Cristiano…
