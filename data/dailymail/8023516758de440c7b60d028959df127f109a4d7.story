Team news

Everton

Everton have 10 players on the injured list with most unlikely to feature against West Ham on Saturday.

Left-back Leighton Baines, who injured a hamstring on international duty, is doubtful while midfielder James McCarthy will be given every chance to recover from a similar problem he suffered a fortnight ago at Sunderland.

A late decision will also be made on fellow midfielder Darron Gibson after he returned from international duty with a minor knee problem.

Provisional squad: Howard, Coleman, Distin, Jagielka, Garbutt, Gibson, McGeady, McCarthy, Barkley, Osman, Lukaku, Robles, Browning, Hibbert, Pienaar, Besic, Atsu, Naismith, Eto'o.

West Ham

West Ham striker Diafra Sakho (back) and midfielder Stewart Downing (knee) are doubtful for Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Everton.

Forward Andy Carroll, fit again following ankle surgery, played and scored in a behind-closed-doors match with Fulham over the international break, so is pressing for a start after a late substitute appearance against Aston Villa.

Provisional squad: Adrian, Cresswell, Reid, Collins, Jenkinson, Downing, Noble, Song, Kouyate, Valencia, Sakho, Jaaskelainen, Carroll, Cole, Nolan, Amalfitano, Tomkins, O'Brien.

42 per cent of the goals the Hammers have netted have come from headers, the highest proportion in the top division.

Diafra Sakho has scored six goals in his last seven Premier League appearances for the Hammers.
