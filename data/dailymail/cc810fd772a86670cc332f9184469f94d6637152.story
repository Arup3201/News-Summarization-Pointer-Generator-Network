Trainer Richard Hannon says his flying two-year-old Tiggy Wiggy is now ‘unlikely’ to run in Sunday’s Group One Prix de L’Abbaye at Longchamp.

Initial enthusiasm for the cross-Channel raid after Tiggy Wiggy won Saturday’s Group One Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket has quickly evaporated.

Hannon said: ‘We haven’t completely made up our minds but I am not keen and would say it is unlikely she will run.

‘She has done plenty this season and won her Group One. I think enough might be enough for her.’

Tiggy Wiggy is 7-2 favourite to become the first two-year-old to win the Abbaye since Sigy in 1978.

If she is scratched, jockey Richard Hughes will be free to maintain his partnership with Eddie Lynam’s Sole Power on whom he was won both the Group One King’s Stand and Nunthorpe Stakes this summer.

Rain fell in Paris on Monday, a positive for the much diminished Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe claims of 2013 winner Treve but not for trainer Charlie Hills who wants dry conditions to persuade him to add his juvenile Cotai Glory to the Abbaye.

Meanwhile, Hannon could make another dent in the £150,000 he trails John Gosden in the trainers’ championship this weekend.

He is still considering whether to run top juvenile colt Ivawood in the £500,000 Tattersalls Millions Trophy at Newmarket where he hopes his 2013 1,000 Guineas winner Sky Lantern can recapture her form in the Group One Sun Chariot Stakes.

A poor run from Sky Lantern is likely to see her retired.

In two runs this season, the four-time Group One winner has been unplaced behind Integral in the Duke Of Cambridge Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Falmouth Stakes at the Newmarket July course.

Sir Michael Stoute’s Integral will be in opposition again while Andre Fabre is poised to be three-handed with Esoterique, Fintry and Miss France, this season’ s Guineas winner, intended starters.

Hannon said: ‘Sky Lantern is working better and has had a nice rest. We knew she wasn’t fit enough at Royal Ascot and then it was soft ground at Newmarket.

‘We are disappointed she hasn’t won so far and if she doesn’t run well she will probably be off to the paddocks.’
