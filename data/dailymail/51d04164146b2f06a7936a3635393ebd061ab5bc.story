These shocking clips capture the heart-stopping near misses recorded on level crossings around the country including one video of a man seconds away from being killed by a train.

In another astonishing piece of footage a cyclist is sent flying from his saddle by the closing barriers after failing to stop in front of the flashing lights.

The CCTV videos were released by the British Transport Police (BTP) as part of a new campaign to stop people misusing crossings.

Seconds from death: British Transport Police have released a series of near miss videos on level crossings as part of a new safety campaign. Here, a man strolls over  seconds before a train in Dundee, Scotland

In another clip, a motorist gets stuck on the train tracks after driving across the line as the barriers shut.

As part of the safety campaign, officers are carrying out a number of high-visibility patrols at a number of locations during a week of action that started today.

BTP will team up with the Network Rail in the 'Operation Look' awareness campaign, backed by the RAC and the AA, in a bid to promote the safe use of level crossings.

Inspector Becky Warren of BTP said: 'All too often people get into the habit of taking risks at crossings and our message is simple, use crossings safely.

Risking his life: The man was seen on CCTV casually passing the closed barriers on the crossing in Dundee

'It may be tempting to jump a light to shave a minute or two off your journey, but every time you do, you endanger your life and the lives of other road and rail users.

'Fail to obey the signals and you may also end up with a driving ban or a criminal record - is it really worth the risk?'

Figures showed that 337 motorists failed to obey warning lights or lowering barriers at level crossings in Scotland last year.

Darren Furness, head of level crossings for Network Rail, said: 'Level crossings create a risk for people that we want to remove.

'Where possible we close them and we have already closed more than 900 in the past five years.

Stranded: The motorist is suddenly forced to turn as their way is blocked by the safety barrier

Danger: The motorist desperately drives away from the crossing before the oncoming train can arrive

'Those we cannot close we aim to make safer and awareness events like these mean we can meet and talk to motorists, cyclists and pedestrians about the dangers and how to stay safe.

'We know waiting at crossings can sometimes be frustrating but it is really important that people do not get complacent or ignore warnings lights as this can put lives at risk.'

BTP will deploy their fleet of mobile safety vehicles at crossings across the country throughout the week of action and offer safety advice to motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.

Tina Hughes, Network Rail's level crossing champion, said: 'Having lost my 14-year-old daughter, Olivia, with her friend on a level crossing in 2005, I am delighted to see this nationwide week of action.

'It brings BTP and Network Rail together to emphasise the importance of education and enforcement to help and encourage people to behave safely at level crossings.'

The safey campaign has been welcomed by Tina Hughes, whose daughter Olivia Bazlington was killed with her 13-year-old friend Charlie Thompson when they were struck by a train at a level crossing in Elsenham, Essex.

Ms Bazlington, who is Network Rail's level crossing champion, said: 'Having lost my 14-year-old daughter, Olivia, with her friend on a level crossing in 2005, I am delighted to see this nationwide week of action.

'It's just the most awful experience and I don't want anyone else to go through this. If you are hit by a car you might survived but if it's by a train you won't.

'Trains can't stop so even if the driver sees you they cannot do anything. It's a horrible experience for the driver but for the family it's worse.'

This week BTP will station safety vehicles with automatic number plate recognition cameras to catch dangerous drivers in the act.

Between April 1 last year and January 1, 2015, 400 motorists were charged or summonsed for crossing misuse.

A further 357 received fixed penalty notices, 16 were cautioned and 568 were sent on driver awareness courses.
