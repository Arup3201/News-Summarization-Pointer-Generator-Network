If a boy wrestling for a Catholic school in central Pennsylvania should find himself across from a female opponent on the mat, he'll have to forfeit under a new diocese policy.

The policy from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg is meant to address safety and modesty concerns, officials said.

It also applies to football and rugby.

ABC News reports that Bishop Ronald W. Gainer outlined the new policy in a statement to the media.

'Preparation for Christian adulthood likewise involves  the development and encouragement of appropriate, dignified and respectful forms of contact between male and female students,' he said.

'The Diocese therefore believes that it is incompatible with its 
religious mission and with its efforts to teach Gospel values to condone
 competitions between young men and women in sports that involve 
substantial and potentially immodest physical contact.'

There are 15 south central Pennsylvania counties and over 11,000 students in the diocese.

That includes seven high schools.

The move comes after several years of controversy over co-ed sports.

The Archbishop of Philadelphia banned co-ed competition in Catholic Youth Organization football in 2013.

The decision was reversed after an awareness campaign.

Overall, female participation in high school wrestling is up.

In the 2013-2014 school year there were 9,904 girls wrestling according to the National Federation of State High School Associations - up more than 2,000 from the 2010-2011 year.

There were roughly 322 girls playing rugby in the 2013-2014 season and about 1,700 of them on high school football teams.

First reported by WITF, the policy bars women from being wrestlers, rugby players, or engaging in tackle football.

Catholic school students are, however, allowed to face female opponents from opposing school's rugby teams and football teams.

Besides forfeiting, male wrestlers could also try negotiating with the other team so 'a female wrestler would not wrestle one of our athletes.'
