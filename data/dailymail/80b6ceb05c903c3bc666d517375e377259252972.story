Police in Utah have praised the smarts of a three-year-old boy who was kidnapped on Tuesday morning after a thief stole a car with him on the backseat.

The toddler's mother, Elizabeth Barrios, told police she was dropping off another child at daycare about 7am and left three-year-old Aiden in the vehicle, which was running with the keys in the ignition.

A man then came alone and stole the 2012 Mazda 3 from the 200 block of 2nd St. in Ogden.

Barrios said she came out of the daycare to the see car driving away, with Aiden inside.

Close call:  Authorities say Elizabeth Barrios left her car unlocked and running as she dropped off another child at daycare, only for someone to drive off in the car with her son on Aiden on the back seat

Barrios told police that when she walked out of the daycare in Ogden, Utah, she saw her own car driving off down the street

Clever little thing: At just three-years-old, Aiden was able to lead police to his whereabouts after his, Elizabeth Barrios, left him in the car unattended and the car was stolen on Tuesday

Scene: Barrios was dropping another child off at Daycare in this block of Ogden, Utah, when a man came and took off in the car

Barrios went back inside the daycare and called 911, because her cell phone was in the car.

Police arrived at the scene and decided to call the phone to see whether the thief or Aiden might answer.

The phone picked up and it was Aiden.

He was able to tell police that he was in the car and that the man had left.

Police told Aiden to start honking the horn, which he did.

Within a few moments a patrol car was able to find him using the horn.

Aiden was not injured and was back with his mother just 45 minutes after the car was stolen, Fox 13 reported. 

Lucky: Police say the incident should serve as a serious reminded to never leave a child unattended 

Smart: Aiden, seen here as a child in a photo from his mom's Facebook, helped police find him

Mother-son: Elizabeth and Aiden Barrios seen here in a photo from Facebook

Reunited: Police were able to find the car and Aiden, who was not injured, within 45 minutes

Police are still investigating the incident and hope to find the man who stole the car.

It seems he fled the vehicle once realizing Aiden was in it.

Police also said the incident was a serious reminder never to leave a child unattended in a car, even if it's only for a moment.
