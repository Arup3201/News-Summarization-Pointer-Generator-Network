On board: TV personality Ryan Seacrest and his actress girlfriend Julianne Hough were on the latest flight which had to make an emergency landing

A British Airways jet carrying 266 people has been forced to make an emergency landing due to suspected toxic oil fumes, just 11 days after a similar incident.

The Boeing 747, which was carrying American Idol host Ryan Seacrest and his girlfriend, the singer and accress Julianne Hough, was not even one hour into the journey from Los Angeles to Heathrow when it was forced to land again after passengers and crew started to feel unwell.

The captain had become concerned after crew and business class customers were affected early on during the flight on Thursday.

All three pilots and four cabin crew had to be taken to hospital for checks, while a number of passengers were treated by paramedics, after emergency services met the aircraft in Las Vegas, the Sunday Express has reported.

Following the incident, a BA spokesman said: 'Safety is always our top priority and as a precaution, the Captain decided to divert our Los Angeles to London service into Las Vegas, following a suspected technical problem.

'Our pilots used their training and experience throughout and the flight landed normally at Las Vegas.

'We provided hotels for the customers and we will be rebooking customers onto alternative flights out of Las Vegas as soon as possible.'

The news comes just one week after it was revealed a BA Boeing 777 was forced to make an emergency landing in Canada, as it made its way from Heathrow to Philadelphia, after suspected toxic oil fumes were reported on the flight deck. In that instance the plane, carrying 158 passengers, made the unscheduled stop at Goose Bay, in Newfoundland, in temperatures of -30C.

British Airways said the latest aircraft has been taken out of service for investigation. It said there were early indications which pointed to a 'fault with the number three engine', according to the Sunday Express.

A spokesman said: 'The engine's maintenance programme would, of course, be in accordance with the manufacturer's regulations. Safety is always our top priority.'

The spokesman apologised to the passengers on Thursday night's flight and said: 'The smell could only be smelt on the upper deck and 20 business class customers in that area were informed of the situation. There was no unusual smell on the main deck.'

Three weeks ago the first picture was released of one of two top BA pilots who died within days of each other after complaining about being exposed to toxic oil fumes on passenger planes.

It was reported last month that Richard Westgate, 43, died after instructing his lawyers to sue BA for health and safety breaches days before fellow pilot Karen Lysakowska, 43, passed away.

Both claimed they had been poisoned by the fumes that can contaminate cabin air and which regularly force pilots to wear oxygen masks. Mr Westgate's lawyers want to 'give him the trial he never got' by suing the airline in a case they say will be a 'moment of truth' for the aviation industry.

They say they are on the cusp of proving in court the existence of 'aerotoxic syndrome', a chronic physical and neurological condition they insist will one day be seen as 'the new asbestos'. Thousands of pilots are currently 'unfit to fly', one specialist doctor has claimed.

A BA spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with the families of the two pilots at this very sad time and we offer our sincere condolences.Â 

'We are not aware of any legal claims relating to the two individuals. It would be inappropriate for us to comment or speculate upon the individuals' cause of death.'

BA has said it is not aware of any link between the deaths and the latest incident.
