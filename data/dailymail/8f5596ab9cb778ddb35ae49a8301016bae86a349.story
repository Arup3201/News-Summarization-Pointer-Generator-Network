Liverpool's hopes of qualifying for the last 16 of the Champions League hang in the balance following their 1-0 defeat away to Real Madrid on Tuesday night. Karim Benzema's decisive goal means the Reds have now lost three successive games in Group B with only two matches remaining. 

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has come under fire for his team selection against Real - opting to not include seven first-team starters from his line-up. We asked Anfield Road fansite's Jim Boardman his views on Rodgers' tactics.

For 5000 Liverpool fans lucky enough to travel to Madrid and take in the whole experience of a European away the feeling on Wednesday won't be one of despondency about the result.

Liverpool lost against Real Madrid, their third Champions League defeat in succession but, as many will tell you, there's a lot more to a European away trip than the game itself.

The match at the Santiago Bernabeu wasn't all that bad, at least if you forget about the score, if you look at it in the context of what has been awful season so far for Liverpool.

Over 5000 Liverpool fans made the trip to the Bernabeu expecting Rodgers to field his possible strongest team

The players drafted in from Brendan Rodgers' backup list performed well, in many cases putting in a better shift than those he might consider first choice. Yet there was always a sense that Madrid could do far more than they were actually doing in this game.

For Rodgers to announce that the Champions League was behind the Premier League in his priorities was a low point during his reign, a sign he didn't really understand what that trophy meant to the fans that have continued to sing his name even during the wobbles of this term. There is still time for him to get the season back in the right direction, but he is really testing the fans' loyalty. The players he put out Tuesday night helped him, to some extent, but that's based on a gradual lowering of expectations over the course of a season.

Perhaps the best indication of what the competition means to Liverpool fans, and what the expectations were at the outset, comes from skipper Steven Gerrard, one of those Rodgers chose to leave on the bench Tuesday night.

Speaking after the Champions League draw had been made, Gerrard said: 'It was massive - I planned my whole day around the Champions League draw. We couldn't wait for it, it was so exciting. I've missed it so much. There's almost a jealousy when you watch the Champions League and you're not involved in it.

'They (Real) were one of the sides that all of the players wanted, and certainly the supporters.'

Expectations are kept in place by the hope that sooner or later Liverpool will actually find some form, like last year. There is still some time for that to happen but Rodgers needs to show some honesty with the fans - who listen to everything he says to the press - and maybe a bit of passion if he wants their support through what will undoubtedly be some difficult weeks ahead.

In the summer Rodgers himself was feeding expectations, promising fans 'an exciting time' this season, thanks to the 'great work' he'd done and was about to do with new signings. 'The idea is by the end of August we'll have the squad together and it will be a really exciting time for us next season,' he promised.

Around £120million spent later - mixed of course with the loss of Luis Suarez - Liverpool have been far from exciting. Back in March, referring to Spurs, Rodgers said 'a team that spent £100m… must have been hoping to challenge for the league.' But not Liverpool?

Rodgers raised expectations, increased hope, then struggled to deliver what he'd suggested was on its way. He's still got time to deliver it, but no more time to waste.
