Americans have opened their hearts and their checkbooks in solidarity with the millions impacted by the ravaging hurricane that pummeled the east coast this week.

The American Red Cross said it has already raised $11million in the aftermath of the superstorm, with major corporations in the New York area leading the charge.

The New York Yankees donated half a million dollars to the charity, with Citi Foundation, CVS Caremark and the United Airlines Foundation also making sizable donations to the cause.

News Corp’s Rupert Murdoch donated $1million to relief efforts, saying despite the devastating damage he was 'heartened by the stories of communities pulling together'.

The media mogul gave $500,000 to the Mayor’s Fund for NYC and $500,000 for relief work in New Jersey.

Donations were also pouring into The Salvation Army, named the official feeding organisation by the Office of Emergency Management at evacuation shelters across New York City.

The non-profit was mobilising volunteers to feed thousands of New Yorkers displaced and without electricity by the superstorm.

Hope for New York was also asking for volunteers to donate blankets for homeless shelters without power and seeking supplies for hygiene kits.

Celebrities also jumped on the charitable bandwagon, publicising relief efforts and encouraging fans to donate.
