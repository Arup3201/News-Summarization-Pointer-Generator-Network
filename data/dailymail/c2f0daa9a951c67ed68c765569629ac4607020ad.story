A young mother who was left paralysed after a row over a spilt drink broke down in court yesterday after her attacker was allowed home for Christmas.

Claire Hilton, 29, yelled at Christopher Towers: ‘Look what you’ve done. You’ve ruined my life.’

She wept as Towers was granted bail, meaning he can spend the festive season at home with his family.

He will almost certainly be jailed when he returns in the New Year to be sentenced.

'You've ruined my life': Miss Hilton told the court it 'was not fair' was able to spend Christmas at home with his family

The court had heard how Towers, 24, 
chased Miss Hilton and then punched her in the face after an argument 
over a pint of cider costing £2.80.

The impact threw Miss Hilton back on to a dry stone wall and she broke her back and neck.

Yesterday
Miss Hilton, who was sat just a few feet away from Towers in her 
wheelchair, was unable to contain her anger as he was given bail and 
interrupted: ‘So he gets Christmas out and has ruined my life? It’s not 
fair.’

She then waited for 
him to leave the dock with his co-accused before looking him in the face
and demanding: ‘Look at what you have done to me. Look at what you have
done. You have ruined my life.’

Thug: Christopher Towers admitted grievous bodily harm but was bailed until the New Year

Towers,
whose mother and girlfriend were in the dock alongside him, refused to 
look at his tearful victim after admitting a lesser charge of grievous 
bodily harm and instead strode past her and out of  the court.

He
had originally been accused of GBH with intent – a crime that carries a
maximum sentence of life – but after an eleventh-hour plea-bargain the 
charge was dropped for the lesser offence which carries a five-year 
limit.

He will return to Newcastle Crown Court on January 6 when he will be sentenced.

Outside
court Miss Hilton, who is paralysed from the waist down, said: ‘I 
cannot see why he should have Christmas out with his family. He’s ruined
my life forever. I can’t understand why he was bailed.

‘I
feel totally let down by the justice system. I have been given the 
short straw of this throughout. I’m absolutely devastated. My Christmas 
is over this year – all because of him.’

Miss
Hilton, a former telesales worker, was enjoying a quiet night out at 
her local pub in June when her cousin, Lauren Mould, 18, accidentally 
knocked over the £2.80 drink with her handbag.

She
and Miss Mould apologised to Towers, his girlfriend, Kelly McCone, and 
his mother, Lynn Faherty, and even offered to buy them a drink by way of
a goodwill gesture, but they refused to calm down.

Towers,
his mother and girlfriend, who had spent the day drinking, were asked 
to leave the pub and escorted out.

But they waited outside the 
Wheatsheaf pub in West Boldon, South Tyneside, for Miss Hilton and her 
cousin to leave.

They then 
followed the pair as they made their way home with two friends before 
launching the mindless attack.

Miss Hilton, who has been told she will 
never walk again after the attack, recalled yesterday: ‘When we got so 
far away they seemed to be behind us somehow.

‘Christopher
Towers seemed to take a run up and punched me full in the face. I was 
thrown against this wall with such force that it broke my neck.

‘A
friend tried to protect me and he got punched. I was knocked 
unconscious for a few seconds. As I was lying on the ground he hit me 
again. He was like a man possessed.

‘I
just remember telling my friend “I’m paralysed, I’m paralysed”. I told 
him to call an ambulance and said “I can’t feel my legs”. I knew 
straight away.’

She added: 
‘It was all over a spilt drink. It wasn’t even half a glass. We offered 
to buy Kelly McCone a fresh drink but they refused. They had been out 
all day and were picking fights with other people. We were the 
unfortunate ones.’

Miss 
Hilton, who spent a month in intensive care, said the assault had 
destroyed her family life. She has been unable to live with her son 
Callum, 11, and he is being cared for by her mother.

‘He (Towers) is going to get at the most five years, if that. He has ruined my life and Callum’s life forever,’ she said.

She now relies on the support of her parents, Paddy and Jan, and sisters Sam, 24, and Amanda, 33.

Towers,
from Boldon, South Tyneside, also admitted assaulting Miss Hilton’s 
friend, Hugh Anderson, 47, who was attacked as he tried to protect her.

McKone, 30, of Jarrow, admitted common assault on Miss Hilton. Flaherty, 46, of Boldon, admitted assaulting another woman.

Judge Esmond Faulks adjourned the case for pre-sentence reports.
