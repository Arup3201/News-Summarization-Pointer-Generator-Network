There is no doubting the popularity of the English Premiership across much of the world.

But, with stiff competition from American Football, Ice Hockey and baseball, it has never quite reached the fevered levels in the U.S.

But, as these pictures show, that could all be about to change.

Popular: A New York City subway car bears advertising for NBC's coverage of the English Premier League. The network has spent $250 million to win the U.S. broadcast rights to the league for the next three seasons

Boost: The network will show 380 regular-season games live across its different platforms. This train shows a design which reads: 'Keep calm and pick Liverpool'

Subway cars in New York are currently bearing the slogans of some of English football's most famous clubs.

Doors on trains read: 'Arsenal fans enter here' while others read 'keep calm and pick Everton.'

The advertising is all part of NBC's attempts to promote its coverage of the Premier League.

The network has spent £161 million to win the U.S. broadcast rights to the English Premier League for the next three seasons.

Incredibly, the network will show 380 
regular-season games live across its different platforms.

Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Jon Miller, president of programming for NBC Sports Group, said: 'People are always looking for the best of the best. 

Branding: Subway cars across New York are bearing the slogans of some of English football's most famous clubs

Promotion: The insides of the trains are also decorated with the colours and badges of famous English football clubs. This train has Manchester United seats

'And clearly the sport is 
the No. 1 sport in the world.'

Despite the enormous popularity of the Premier League across Europe and Asia, it is nowhere near as popular with U.S. TV viewers.

The Premier League games will be competing with American Football, Basketball and Ice Hockey.

Viewers in America will also have to get used to early starts - the Liverpool v Stoke City 
game will start at 4:45 a.m in some areas.

But NBC is confident the Premier League will give the network a boost over its rivals ESPN
and Fox.

Exposure: Although the Premier League is hugely popular in Europe and Asia, it is as successful in America. It is hoped NBC's coverage will boost audience figures across the U.S.

Televised: The network's coverage begins on August 17 with a match between Liverpool and Stoke City

And it is not approaching the season half-hearted.  It has scheduled more than 1,600 hours 
of annual programming which, in addition to the live games, will also include studio programs and other 
content .

TV analyst Kyle Martino said NBC plans to show the U.S. audience as much football as possible. Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, he said: 'We think every single game is important. And regardless 
of who you're following, you can go see that.'

The subway advertising campaign comes after Tottenham winger Gareth Bale was splashed across Times Square as part of NBC 's promotion.

In adverts across the US, NBC had English voices chanting: 'Premier League on NBC,’ with people kitted out in shirts of Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Fulham.

Another promotion was: ‘Forget Downton Abbey. The real English drama is coming on August 17.’
