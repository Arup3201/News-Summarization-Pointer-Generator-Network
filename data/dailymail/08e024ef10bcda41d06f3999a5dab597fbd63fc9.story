It has long been a dream of man to possess the power to walk up vertical surfaces.

And now the wait could finally be over thanks to a team of student engineers from Utah State University who have constructed their very own wall-crawler out of an adapted vacuum cleaner.

Their 'Ascending Aggies' device, which is worn like a backpack, can climb 90ft up any surface - including glass, brick or rock - without a rope.

'Ascending Aggies': A team of student engineers from Utah State University have constructed their very own wall-crawler out of an adapted vacuum cleaner

Up, up and away: The device, which is worn like a backpack, can climb 90ft up any surface - including glass, brick or rock - without a rope

Led by Dr Steve Hansen, the 15-man 
team was inspired by a U.S. Air Force request for the scientific 
community to solve the problem of how a soldier can scale a high wall 
without using a grappling hook.

They have now been given $100,000 to continue development after impressing military chiefs with their prototype.

The Ascending Aggies is powered by a 
battery which lasts for half an hour, far longer than the length of time
anticipated for a soldier to hoist himself over a wall.

But the most important element of the team's mission was to come up with technology that can grip to any vertical surface.

They developed the Personal Vacuum 
Assisted Climber (PVAC), which is made from two suction pads and bits 
and bobs from a household vacuum cleaner.

The pads, unsurprisingly, form an 
airtight seal when pressed against a vertical surface which is 
strengthened by the suction from the vacuum .

Future improvements: The team wants to make the pack smaller, less heavy and less noisy

It can also be operated hands-free, allowing a soldier to wield a weapon or other device without falling to the ground.

Dr Steve Hansen told Business 
Insider: 'The beauty of this solution was that it is relatively surface 
independent, allowing a soldier to use a weapon or other device while 
hanging from the PVAC.'

One major drawback is the noise the 
Ascending Aggies currently makes, which totally destroys any chance of 
achieving a surprise attack.

But the Utah State team hopes to tackle this next.

Dr Hansen said: 'This is not a major problem in a daytime urban environment, but is a problem in a nighttime stealth operation.

'In the next version, technology will
be used or developed to suppress, reduce, or cancel the noise of the 
vacuums and the motors.'

Other improvements the engineers want to implement are to make the pack smaller and less heavy.
