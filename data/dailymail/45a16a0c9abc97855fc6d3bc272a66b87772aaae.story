Joleon Lescott has signed a two-year deal at West Browmich Albion to complete a major coup for the west midlands side.

The 31-year-old centre-back moves to the Hawthorns from Manchester City on a free transfer after his contract expired.

He has penned a deal worth in the region of £45,000 per week and links up again with new head coach Alan Irvine after they worked together at Everton.

Lescott won two Premier League titles,
 one FA Cup and a League Cup during his five-year stay at the Etihad and
 will bring valuable experience to the West Brom squad.

He
 had been tracked by Aston Villa, Hull and Stoke but becomes Irvine’s 
first signing after Craig Gardner joined for free earlier in the summer.

Lescott
 came through the ranks at Albion’s arch rivals Wolves before moving to 
Goodison for £5million, then on to City for £22m in 2009. He has a third
 year option at the Hawthrons related to performance.

‘I’m
 delighted we’ve been able to agree a deal with Joleon,’ said Irvine. 
‘He’s an England international and a proven Premier League player, who 
has been at the top level for a number of years.

‘When we realised he was available and there was a realistic chance of getting him here we started to work very hard on it.

‘Full credit to the board and everyone at the club for getting this done as quickly and effectively as they did.

‘I know Joleon and the type of personality and character he is, in addition to knowing what he can do as a player.

‘He’s a great professional and he will add to a number of very good professionals who are already in the squad.’

West Brom are also exploring the possibility of bringing Jack Rodwell to the club as well as former loan star Kieran Richardson.
