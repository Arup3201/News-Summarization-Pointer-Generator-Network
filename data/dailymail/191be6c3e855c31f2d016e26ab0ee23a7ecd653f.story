Children's sweets were last night at the centre of new fears over the horsemeat scandal.

It emerged that gelatine, which originates from the skin and bones of animals and is found in sweets as well as jelly, trifles and some yoghurts, will be tested for traces of horse.

The tests will be expanded to 514 products in total, including stock cubes and steak, the Food Standards Agency said yesterday.

Products such as stock cubes contain gelatine which is made from the skin and bone of animals

Last night the FSA could not confirm whether children’s sweets would be among the products tested, as it had not yet decided on the exact list.

The news came as the House of Commons catering outlets were dragged into the scandal.

Parliamentary authorities admitted four beef products had been withdrawn from the heavily subsidised eateries used by MPs, peers and staff.

Nestle has confirmed that three of its products have been recalled from France, Italy and Spain

A Commons spokesman said the withdrawn products were steak and kidney pie, beef and onion pie, steak and kidney suet pudding, and beef meat balls.

He added the move was 'precautionary' after one of the House’s suppliers, Brakes, announced it was carrying out tests.

He added: 'This relates to meat derivative products rather than to fresh meat provided at the House of Commons.'

A spokesman for Brakes last night said that all four of the products the Commons asked it to test were negative for horse DNA.

Two phases of FSA testing are currently ongoing. The first phase includes raw minced beef products such as burgers, minced beef and meat balls, which are being checked for horse and pork DNA.

The second includes 140 samples of beef-based ready meals including lasagne and cottage pie. The third phase, which will begin next week, includes products marketed or labelled as containing beef as a major ingredient, such as gelatine, stock cubes and beef dripping.

These 150 samples will bring the total number of products tested to 514.

The FSA will publish the results from all three phases of the study, including brand names, with initial findings available from the end of the month.

Twenty-eight local authorities are carrying out the sampling for the first two phases. Sampling for the third will be allocated to other councils. The agency will disclose any formal action taken in April.

Meanwhile Nestle confirmed that three of its products had been recalled in France, Italy and Spain. They were not on sale in the UK.

In a statement, the company said: 'Our tests have found traces of horse DNA in two products made from beef supplied by HJ Schypke [a German firm].

'The levels found are above the 1 per cent threshold the UK’s Food Safety Agency uses to indicate likely adulteration or gross negligence.

'We have informed the authorities accordingly.'
