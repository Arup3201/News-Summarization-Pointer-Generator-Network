Three Canadian men, including one who may have already been killed while fighting alongside militants in the Middle East, have been charged in an extensive terrorism investigation.

Khadar Khalib, 23, Awso Peshdary, 25, and John Maguire, who is 20 if still alive, are suspected of aiding ISIS fighters and plotting a domestic attack.

Peshdary was arrested in Ottawa on Tuesday morning while warrants are out for Maguire and Khalib, who are believed to be at large fighting with ISIS in Syria or Iraq.

'Through each terrorist-related charge we lay and each arrest we make, we send a message, which illustrates our strong resolve to root out terrorist threats,' Royal Canadian Mounted Police Chief Superintendent Jennifer Strachan told a news conference.

The national security investigation which led to the arrest warrants being issued has been dubbed Project Servant.

It began in December 2012, the month Maguire left Canada to participate in the civil war in Syria, and culminated on January 21, 2015. 

Peshdary of Ottawa has been charged with participation in the activity of a terrorist group and with facilitating an activity for a terrorist group.

It is believed he financed other young men’s travel to join the Islamic State. 

A senior police official said Peshdary was the subject of a prior terror investigation but there was not enough evidence to arrest him at the time.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak ahead of the planned announcement Tuesday. 

The Associated Press first released details of the arrest and charges against the three men.

Charges have also been laid in absentia against Khalib and Maguire.

Khalib is charged with leaving Canada to participate in the activities of a terrorist group, and counselling a person to participate in an activity of a terrorist group.

Police have charged Maguire with facilitating an activity for a terrorist group.

All three are also charged with conspiring to participate or to contribute in an activity of a terrorist group.

Last month, Ottawa confirmed that it was investigating reports that Maguire, who also uses the name Abu Anwar Al-Canadi, was killed in northern Syria while fighting alongside ISIS militants. 

A pro-ISIS Twitter account reported that Maguire had been killed in the city of Kobani, which has been hammered in recent weeks by coalition airstrikes.

A video posted online last December showed Maguire encouraging attacks on Canadian soil, similar to those carried out in October in Ottawa and St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec.

On Tuesday, RCMP said despite the reports of Maguire’s death, the force has not seen any credible evidence to confirm that he had died.

Chief Supt. Jennifer Strachan said Maguire travelled to Turkey in December 2012 and is confirmed to be a member of ISIS. 

Notices have been sent out through Interpol. Canada is taking part in the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State extremists in Iraq and Syria. 

The RCMP said in October it was tracking about 90 individuals who could pose a danger in Canada or abroad, and vowed to make more arrests.
