A New Zealand jihadi fighting for ISIS has been accidentally tweeting his location from within Syria as he updates his followers on his time in the warzone. 

Mark Taylor, who is known on Twitter as @M_Taylor_Kiwi had forgotten to switch off the geo-location on his tweets as he travelled across Syria. 

Taylor, who changed his name to Abu Abdul-Rahman, made a series of 45 tweets which broadcast his ever-changing location.

The series of tweets was saved by the Canadian based social media jihad monitor Ibrabo. 

Taylor soon deleted his tweets, which gave vital intelligence information to various government agencies. 

According to a blog post, Ibrabo claimed: 'Taylor isn’t the first jihadist to broadcast his whereabouts via social media and in fact looking at the battlefield in Syria we see fighters from Canada, France, and other western countries making the same mistake. The benefit of material like this when examining foreign fighters is it allows investigators to establish the extent to which an individual is tied to a terrorist group like Daesh (ISIS). In this manner they can better justify potential criminal charges against the individual and at the very least build grounds for their detention and investigation upon their return.'

According to Ibrabo, Taylor used one house in Al Tabaqah in the south west part of the city.   

'Taylor eager for the fame of being a violent jihadist took to twitter to get attention for his exploits. His statements and twitter missteps have solidified his involvement with ISIS and will provide the evidence should he ever try to return to New Zealand. His ignorance and the ignorance of others has been an advantage to intelligence agencies around the world looking to protect their nations and track the progress of ISIS. 

Ibrabo were able to track several of Mark Taylor's tweets to an individual house in Al Tabaqah

Ibrabo claimed that Taylor's error has provided vital information to western intelligence agencies 

Ibrabo found a series of 45 tweets which provided very detailed information about Taylor's location

The series of tweets could have identified a number of ISIS safe houses across several Syrian cities 

Ibrabo added: 'Taylor’s numerous failures demonstrate the opportunities that can be gained through monitoring and tracking extremists via social media and telecommunications. Given his need for attention I’m sure this will not be the last we hear from Kiwi Jihadi. With luck he will fail to read the manual on his next shiny new phone!'

Taylor came to public prominence when he burned his New Zealand passport and recorded the incident on YouTube. 

He later denied that he had been seeking new travel documents claiming that reports of his wish to return to New Zealand were false.  

In July this year he told the New Zealand Herald on Sunday that he would remain in Syria until he achieved 'martyrdom'.

He said he became a jihad because he was 'refused by the NZ Army for re-enlistment'.

In a 15 second video posted on YouTube in June, a man who is named as Taylor says: 'I am the New Zealander known as Mark John Taylor, my current location is in Syria and my commitment is for jihad, for Allah and his messenger.'

In September 2011, he appeared on TV3's 60 Minutes and claimed his life had been ruined after he previously travelled to Pakistan in 2009 and tried to enter the al-Qaeda stronghold of Wana.

He said he had only travelled to the Middle Eastern country to 'find a wife'.

He was exposed when he was named amongst a list of 23 Australian-based people of security interest in a secret diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks.

'I didn't have a death wish I was just looking for a lady for marriage. It was my mistake. People might call me stupid and dumb for making that mistake but that's my problem,' he told 60 Minutes.

New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said in 2011 that Taylor was 'someone that has quite a number of restrictions on him for very good reasons'.

But Taylor was released without charge in Pakistan and moved to Australia, back to New Zealand, and then Indonesia where he worked as English teacher before travelling to Syria via Turkey in July this year - despite his travel restrictions.

In June he reportedly told The Australian that he hasn't joined any groups 'except for al-Qaeda'.

The paper reports that on Sunday, he commented on Facebook that New Zealand authorities 'don’t seem concern (sic) I’m in Syria'.

Despite his apparent desire to have a New Zealand passport again, Taylor reportedly told the Aotearoa Independent Media Centre that he doesn't actually want to return to New Zealand.
