A massive 93 per cent of British women say that wearing high heels is painful

British women own 25 pairs of shoes - but don’t wear a quarter of them because they are too uncomfortable, according to a new study.

The research shows the typical woman has five shoes worth £190 languishing unused, as much as £3.3 billion worth lying abandoned across the UK.

Yet this apparent waste doesn’t slow down spending, with the research showing British women buy 17 pairs a year at a cost of £608.

Even the stylish French and Spanish buy fewer pairs, although it seems women on the continent are more likely to value quality over quantity.

The study commissioned by Compeed shows German, Italian and French women all spend more per pair, with ladies in this country typically raiding the sales and spending £38 a time.

Four in ten British women admit they snap up ‘bargains’ in the summer and spring sales.

In contrast, German and Italian women spend £55 on each pair of shoes.

Perhaps buying in haste leads British women to regret their purchases with 21 per cent admitting they feel pain due to blisters.

Indeed, 93 per cent say wearing high heels is painful.

So why is it women are happy to spend so much on unwearable shoes which they then leave to gather dust in the back of the wardrobe?

Psychologist Emma Kenny suggests they are willing to repeatedly endure discomfort because heels make them feel sexy, confident and elegant.

She said: 'Women buy high heels because they make them feel confident and sexy.

'Confidence is something we all aspire to. It makes us happy, full of direction and in control of our lives; so it makes sense that we invest in things which aid this feeling.

'The results show that British women agree, and that’s why they see shoes as important purchases they make on a regular basis.

'With confidence comes possibilities which helps explain the amount of money women will spend on shoes over a lifetime.'
