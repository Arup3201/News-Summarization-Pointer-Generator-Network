England struggled to get going on their tour of New Zealand, losing every game in a 3-0 whitewash. Here, Sportsmail's Chris Foy offers his verdict on all of Stuart Lancaster's men.

The All Blacks began the series with a narrow 20-15 victory in Auckland, before an incredibly narrow 28-27 victory in the second Test secured overall victory. And a 36-13 romp in the final game ensured that England would return to the Northern Hemisphere empty handed.

New Zealand have now won 17 tests in a row, equalling a record set by themselves in the 1960s, and equalled by South Africa between 1997-98.

Underwhelming: England were on the end of a 3-0 series defeat at the hands of New Zealand

Test starters   Chris Ashton – After late arrival, try-scoring cameo in Dunedin led to starting chance in third Test but couldn’t capitalise. 5.5

Light and shade: A good display off the bench in second Test couldn't be capitalised upon in the third

Mike Brown – A dip from the staggering heights of his season-of-a-lifetime. Errors crept in but still a spirited effort. 6.5

Dip: Mike Brown could not live up to his superb early season form

Freddie Burns – Rose and fell in a fortnight. Superb personal outing in Auckland gave way to a comedown in Hamilton. 6

Indifferent: Freddie Burns was superb in the opening Test, but disappointing in the final encounter

Luther Burrell – Brought in for second Test, he was exposed defensively and lost starting place but rallied in finale. 5.5

Exposed: Luther Burrell struggled in defence but rallied well

Danny Care – Calamitous end to a fine campaign with training-ground accident, off-key comeback and an injury relapse. 5

Relapse: Danny Care suffered a calamitous injury in training that curtailed his series

Kyle Eastmond – Another who veered from triumph to disaster. A quick-step revelation before his horrors in Hamilton. 5.5

Veered: Started the series well but had a horror show in Hamilton

Owen Farrell – Missed opener and was not at full throttle a week later, especially in defence, then injury ended his tour. 6

Mixed: Owen Farrell missed the start of the series then had it curtailed by injury

Dylan Hartley – Delighted to make the trip after injury but it fell flat. Was off the pace in front of his family in Hamilton. 5

Struggeld: Dylan Hartley was off the pace during the tour

James Haskell – Couldn’t do much more to prove his worth. Titanic effort at Eden Park and prominent in midweek win. 7.5

Standout: James Haskell couldn't have done much more to prove his worth

Joe Launchbury – Fell below previous standards. Struggled with re-starts and looked tired at the end of long season. 5.5

Not his best: Joe Launchbury fell below previous standards during the tour

Courtney Lawes – One of the victims of the fixture clash, forced to play catch-up. Committed as ever but not dominant. 6.5

Congested: Courtney Lawes had to play catchup after being a victim of the fixture clash

Joe Marler – Overall his stock rose on the tour. Scored scrum points in Auckland and kept carrying and tackling tirelessly. 7

Rising stock: Joe Marler impressed on the tour overall

Jonny May – His moment of truth came at Eden Park. After hit-and-miss display, he was dropped as coaches lost patience. 5

Disappointing: Failed in his big opportunity at Eden Park

Ben Morgan – Started with a thunderous performance in the series opener. Couldn’ t repeat it but finished in credit. 7

Thunder: Ben Morgan started superbly but tailed off slightly in the next couple of games

Geoff Parling – The stand-out performer in the entire squad. Provided leadership input to go with his varied individual feats. 8.5

Man of the series: Geoff Parling was England's top performer in New Zealand

Chris Robshaw – Magnificent in Auckland as he eclipsed Richie McCaw but concerns about his breakdown work linger. 7

Indifferent: Chris Robshaw was brilliant in Auckland but tailed off like so many others

Manu Tuilagi – Leicester centre pounded the All Blacks before switch to flank and back to midfield. So difficult to contain. 7

Uncontainable: Manu Tuilagi pounded the All Blacks at times

Billy Twelvetrees – A grim episode for him. Recovered from injury but then dropped as a scapegoat for Dunedin defeat. 5

Scapegoat: It was a grim series on the whole for Billy Twelvetrees

Billy Vunipola – Attitude was questioned by coaches early on then his most notable intervention led to costly yellow card. 5.5

Indiscipline: Billy Vunipola's attitude came into question in New Zealand

Rob Webber – Sterling effort from the hooker to return to full fitness and perform valiantly to raise his future prospects. 7.5 

Prospect: It was a valiant display overall from Rob Webber

David Wilson – Aside from fumbles in first Test, Bath prop was among top forwards. Strong work in tight and loose. 8 

Leading from the front: David Wilson put in a superb series of displays for England

Tom Wood – As fervently committed as ever, even amid meltdown in Hamilton. Typical grit, graft and defensive defiance. 7

Committed: Grit, graft and defiance from Tom Wood

Marland Yarde – Scored two tries and last Test may have been his coming-of-age occasion as he cut loose in second half. 8

Cutting loose: Marland Yarde managed two tries for England during the series

Ben Youngs – Wasn’t particularly convincing in opener but turned his tour around with sparky display on final weekend. 7

Turn around: Unconvincing start from Ben Youngs but he turned it around well

Test replacements

Dave Attwood 5, Kieran Brookes 6.5, Danny Cipriani 7.5, Lee Dickson 5, Joe Gray 6, Tom Johnson 6, Matt Mullan 6.5, Chris Pennell 7, Henry Thomas 5.
