It was once used to screen plays and films for children - but it's looking more like something from a horror movie now.

This massive hall was built in the Slovak town of Cierna nad Tisou during the post-war Communist era but has since fallen into disrepair, having been disused for years.

Hundreds of children used to fill the hall and watch left-wing propaganda on a big screen or as part of a play.

Disrepair: The building was used as a theatre and cinema during the Communist era after the Second World War- but it's seen better days

All that remains: The stage that was once home to performances that promoted the Communist message

After 
the communist regime failed and fell in the area, the building was never
 used again

Shocking state: The hall probably needs more than a lick of paint

Meeting point: The hall once hosted talks between leaders from Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union

Dusty and smashed up seats

It was also used for social meetings - and even for talks between the leaders of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.

Dusty, smashed-up seats now fill the spooky auditorium and the roof and walls are peeling and discoloured.

Not really the sort of place you'd want to break out the pop corn in.

Slovakia
 became part of Czechoslovakia in 1945, which came under the control of 
the Communist Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union in 1948.

It
 remained locked into this geo-political arrangement until the Warsaw 
Pact was disbanded in 1991. Slovakia became a sovereign state the 
following year.

Communist
 films that might conceivably have been shown at the hall in Cierna nad 
Tisou include 1946's The Stone Flower, Ballad of Siberia (1947) and 
Cossacks of the Kuban (1949).

The audience might also have been treated to Sergei Eisenstein's Ivan The Terrible.

Those
 wanting a feel for what it was like living in a communist regime might 
like to see 2006's The Lives Of Others. The plot revolves around two 
East Berlin secret police officers monitoring the city in the 1980s and 
offers brilliant insight into the paranoia that seeped through society.
