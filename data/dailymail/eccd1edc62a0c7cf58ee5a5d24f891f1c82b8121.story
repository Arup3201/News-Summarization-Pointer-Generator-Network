A Massachusetts man was convicted of stealing $600,000 worth of Legos, books, audiobooks, and other retail items from stores in the New England area.

John Strang, 67, stole the items from stores in Massachusetts and New Hampshire and then resold them online for profit, according to court documents.

He plead guilty to charges of transportation of stolen goods and now faces up to 10 years in prison.

Strang stole the $600,000 worth of merchandise over the past seven years, The Inquisitir reports.

He then resold the stolen goods for up to half of the market price at online outlet Half.com.

Strang shipped the products to buyers all across the country, according to the site.

It is not clear what kind of profit Strang made from the sales, only that he trafficked in stolen goods.

Strang pled guilty to the charges against him in a US District court earlier this week.

He now faces up to 10 years in prison for his crimes.

His sentencing is scheduled for October 15.
