American was frozen this morning, as temperatures plunged below freezing in every single state for the first time this winter.

From the mountains of Hawaii to northern Florida, through the frigid Midwest and, unsurprisingly, Alaska, thermometers read 32 degrees or below.

The Great Lakes have been the epicenter of the latest rush of winter weather, with parts of upstate New York deluged with an incredible five feet of snow in a matter of hours..

In western New York, authorities were forced to close down the New York State Thruway after snow piled up by the foot overnight.

More than three feet of snow has fallen in and around Buffalo, New York. Watertown, New York, has been hit almost as hard. Nearly two feet has piled up in northern Wisconsin. Northern and western Michigan expects one to two feet.  

Dozens of drivers were stranded and officials declared a state of emergency in Buffalo and the surrounded suburbs. Authorities were enforcing a travel ban and urging residents to stay home, according to the Buffalo News.

Almost the entire country is experiencing temperatures well below normal for this time of the year. In the Midwest, South, and Northeast, it's 15 to 25 degrees colder than it should be for mid-November.

In Northeast Ohio, temperatures hit record lows for November as wind chills dropped to -8 degrees. Lows in Chicago dropped to 12 degrees with a wind chill of -6.  

On Monday, parts of Upstate New York experienced thundersnow, the rattling early winter phenomenon, and could see it again. 

Accuweather meteorologist Tom Kines said big snowfall is contained to a few places experiencing lake effect snow from the Great Lakes. 

'Those places that are getting hit by lake effect are measuring snow by feet not inches,' he said. 

Snow last week ensured that nearly half of the nation is now blanketed in snow - which might not be a record, but it's rare for November, Mr Kines added. 

The arctic blast is expected to bring temperatures well below freezing as far south as Houston on Tuesday morning. Northern Florida and the southeast have even dropped below freezing. In Mariana, Florida, the low this morning was 31 degrees. 

Even lower temperatures are expected for tomorrow in the southeast - where even New Orleans could drop to 31 degrees, setting a record low for this time of year, according to Accuweather.com.

The winter weather has caused 17 deaths - mostly from car crashes because of slippery roads - since Saturday. More crashes are expected as commuters re-learn how to drive in the snow.  

Chilly: By Tuesday afternoon, much of the country was still under deep freeze. Even parts of the south remained below freezing

More of the same: Wednesday promises to severely cold all over again, with freezing temperatures dipping all the way into central Florida and south Texas

Warming slightly: Thursday will be slightly less cold as the weather warms ahead of the weekend. Lows in most places will still be unseasonably chilly

Colder than is should be: Nearly the entire country is experiencing below-average temperatures. In the South, Midwest and Northeast, it's 15 to 25 degrees colder than it normally is this time of year

Snow-vember: Nearly half of the country is covered in snow - from Washington to Texas, Tennessee to Maine there is at least a trace of snow on the ground right now

Whiteout: Snowy clouds can be seen swirling over the Great Lakes, center, and expanding into New York State and New England

Snowed in: One family is Buffalo will have a hard time getting outside thanks to the giant snow drift on their front lawn

Even in Buffalo, a city that knows snow, the winter pounding took some residents by surprise. A Buffalo News photographer captured this young man wearing shorts while helping a driver dig out

In the major northeast cities, residents broke out their heavy winter coats early and bundled up against the bitterest temperatures so far this season. 

In New York City, the low hit 27 degrees, 18 with the wind chill. Washington, DC, hit 28, with a wind chill of 17 degrees. The low in Philadelphia was 27 with a wind chill of 13 this morning. And Boston was a comparatively toasty 38, with a wind chill of 30. 

The temperature is expected to drop even lower tonight - hitting 21 in New York and Philadelphia, 24 in Washington and 23 in Boston. 

Mr Kines, of Accuweather, said the cold temperatures are due to the jetstream settling in the far southern US, which is bringing cold air south from the arctic to blanket nearly the entire country. 

The country is in for more cold the rest of the week - and it will possibly get colder on Wednesday. However, by the weekend temperatures will warm - possibly all the way into the 60s by Monday in the northeastern US. 

The weather forecasts show milder temperatures and few storms on the horizon for the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel, Mr Kines said.  

Coming down: Western Michigan was also hard hit by lake effect snow. Grand Rapids, Michigan, where as much as 10 and a half inches fell on Tuesday

Even cold down south: Two students in Jackson, Mississippi, bundled up on their way to school after temperatures hit 27 degrees. A low of 24 is expected tonight

Surf's not up: Even on the sands of Dania Beach, Florida, the chilly weather kept all but a hardy few out of the sea

Thunder and lightning are more usually associated with warmer climates but under certain conditions they can occur in cold ones too.

Thundersnow starts out like a summer thunderstorm - the sun heats the ground and pushes masses of warm, moist air upward, creating unstable air columns.

As it rises, the moisture condenses to form clouds, which are jostled by internal turbulence.

Lightning is caused by this rubbing of the clouds against each other - thunder is the sound of lightning but as sound moves more slowly than light we hear it later.

The tricky part for making thundersnow is creating that atmospheric instability in the wintertime.

When it is cold, and particularly in air conducive to snowfall, the lower atmosphere is dry, cold and very stable.

For thundersnow to occur there needs to be a very precise set of circumstances - the air layer closer to the ground has to be warmer than the layers above, but still cold enough to create snow.

When this happens warm air rises, snow falls and thunder, lightning and snow all occur at the same time.
