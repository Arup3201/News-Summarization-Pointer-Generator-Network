First Milk is delaying paying dairy farmers for two weeks after supermarket price wars saw the price of a pint of milk plummet to 22 pence last week  

More than 1,000 farmers were not paid for their milk yesterday after a crash in prices plunged the industry into crisis.

The biggest dairy co-operative First Milk delayed payments to its 1,300 farmer members by a fortnight – and cut the price it pays them.

Campaigners warned it was ‘the worst crisis the industry has ever seen’, with little sign of matters improving.

Global milk prices have plummeted in recent months, meaning some British farmers now receive as little as 11.4p a pint (20p a litre) – well below the average 15.9p a pint (28p per litre) it costs to produce it.

Just a year ago farmers could expect to receive 19.2p a pint (34p a litre).

The amount paid to farms is now at its lowest level for eight years, far lower than in 2012, when farmers blockaded milk processors in protest at the low prices they were paid. First Milk, which sells milk to be turned into cheese, butter, yogurt and powdered milk around the world, has increasingly struggled to pay farmers as the lower prices drive down its income.

Its announcement comes after co-operative Arla and processors Dairy Crest and Muller Wiseman also cut their milk prices in recent weeks.

More than 60 dairy farmers are now going out of business every month, according to the National Farmers’ Union.

First Milk chairman Sir Jim Paice, a Conservative MP and former farming minister, said the dairy industry was going through a period of ‘extreme volatility’.

He added: ‘We understand that the milk payment deferral will cause concern for members as direct debits and payments will have been lined up against milk cheques.’ He added: ‘We are aware that hundreds of UK dairy farmers are unlikely to find a home for their milk this spring.

‘Our priority is to make the business and our processing assets as secure as possible.’

Farmers have condemned supermarkets for cutting prices even further. Asda, Aldi, Lidl and Iceland now sell four pints of milk for 89p, while Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose are not far behind at £1. The stores insist they are funding the price cut through their own profits and have not changed what they pay farmers.

But farmers say selling milk more cheaply than mineral water is devaluing the product.

Rob Harrison, of the NFU’s dairy board, said: ‘It looks like this is going to be the worst crisis the dairy industry has ever seen. Retailers are fighting over market share and they are driving farmers out of business. If they don’t support us there will be very few dairy farmers left in this country in six months’ time.’

NFU president Meurig Raymond warned that as farmers have been paid less and less, ‘farm costs remain some 36 per cent higher than they were eight years ago and the single largest cost component of a dairy farm, animal feed, is more than 50 per cent higher than 2007 levels’.

He added: ‘This combination has left many producers under extreme financial pressure and fearing for the future of their dairy businesses. You only have to look at the number of dairy farmers now leaving the sector.’

David Handley, of lobby group Farmers For Action, said it was a ‘dire situation’, warning banks may ‘see this as a death knell’ and stop supporting some farmers, many of whom are already financially stretched.

Campaigners fear the crisis will particularly hit small traditional farms, with large intensive farms increasing their market share.
