Speaking to the hosts of the Dennis & Callahan program on Boston's WEEI radio station Friday, Jeff Bauman recalled the moment he learned that Tamerlan Tsranaev, the older of the two Chechen brothers suspected of setting off the twin blasts, had been killed in a police gun battle. 

'What I thought was, "He's dead and I'm still here,"' said the resilient 27-year-old double amputee.

Bauman, who is credited with helping 
the FBI identify Tamerlan while lying injured in the hospital, said on 
the show that as he was waiting for his girlfriend to cross the finish 
line April 15, he had a feeling that something was not quite right about
one of the spectators.

'Just that one guy, he didn't look 
like he was having a good time. He was standing right next to me. … He 
was just an odd guy, he struck me as odd.

'Next thing you know, I hear fireworks and I'm 
on the ground,' he recalled.

At the time of the explosions, Bauman's girlfriend was a mile away from the finish line and escaped unharmed. 

Bauman became the subject of 
the now-iconic and extremely graphic photo, which shows him being 
carried away by Good Samaritan Carlos Arredondo sporting a cowboy hat.

When Bauman regained consciousness in
Boston Medical Center after the bombing, his brother told Bloomberg 
News he asked for a pen and paper and wrote: 'bag, saw the guy, looked 
right at me,' referring to one of the suspected bombers identified as 
Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

'For the first suspect [Tamerlan] 
they just took my description,' Bauman told WEEI. 'They thought I saw 
the second suspect and they had a sketch artist come in [to the 
hospital] maybe on Wednesday.'

When asked about the moment Bauman 
looked down and saw that his legs had been blown off below the knee, the
27-year-old recalled just feeling 'sad that someone would actually do 
that.' 

Bauman said that before Arredondo picked him up and placed him in a wheelchair, he was certain that he was going to die.

The 27-year-old spoke about his recovery, saying that the process is 'going fast, but it hurts every day.'

Despite all odds, the marathon hero has managed to maintain a positive attitude and look to the future. 

'I’m pissed, obviously, but, I mean, it’s in the past, you know? You only look forward,' he said.

Bauman said he plans to attend the 
marathon next year to witness his girlfriend run, but he is likely to 
stay away from the finish line.

On April 15, the young Costco employee had both his legs blown off in
the first explosion near the marathon finish line and he was bleeding 
out when Carlos Arredondo swooped in to save his life by tying fabric 
around one of his legs and pinching an artery in the other.

Exactly one week after the bombings, Arrendondo visited Bauman in the hospital where he is still recovering.

'I was so happy to see him with his 
big open-wide eyes and very grateful to be able to hug him and let him 
know how proud I am of him,' Arredondo told the Concord Monitor of 
his visit.

A photograph of the two of them - Bauman
sitting white-faced in the wheelchair and grasping his left leg while 
Arredondo, donning a cowboy hat, runs beside him with his artery in hand
- became one of the most widely seen images from the day of the bombings.

'The picture that you see, that’s what 
it is and that how it happened, you know,' Bauman told the Monitor. 'I 
was just trying to help him in every way I could, and thank God he gave 
me the opportunity to help this beautiful young man.'

Arredondo said he spent
an hour with Bauman at the hospital, 'trying to talk with him and laugh
with him and let him know how great he was doing while all this was 
happening.'

He also brought Bauman gifts, 
including a hat and a card signed by military families who have lost 
someone in war. One of Arredondo's sons died in Iraq in 2004 and his 
other son took his own life just before Christmas in 2011.

Bauman has received more than $600,000 in donations for his medical bills over the last week.

His stepmother, Csilla Bauman, of 
Concord, told the newspaper that the 27-year-old has been feeling 
positive about his recovery.

'His mind is just very focused on 
just going every day and getting stronger and just adjusting to this new
way of life that he’s going to live, but in a positive way,' she said.

On  Wednesday, Bauman was photographed delivering a birthday present to 18-year-old bombing victim Sydney Corcoran. The photograph went viral online.

On the day of the marathon, Bauman 
was standing near the finish line and waiting for his girlfriend to 
cross.

When he woke in the hospital several days later, he blurted out that he had seen a man drop a bag near his feet. His description of the man led authorities 
to identify the suspects in the bombing.
