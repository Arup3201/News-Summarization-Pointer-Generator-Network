With temperatures to reach 24C on Saturday people are expected to dust off their barbecues and enjoy the hottest day of the year so far.

Sainsbury's is predicting it will sell 10million sausages – that's enough, if laid end to end, to stretch round the M25 five times.

It also forecasts a 400 per cent boost in sales of hot dog rolls and 250 per cent in suncream.

Meanwhile Waitrose has already seen a rise in sale of burgers, with shoppers favouring the Aberdeen Angus quarter pounder. Packets of salad have also been flying off the shelf with pre-packed salads sales up by 12 per cent compared to same time last year.

After a week of downpours Tesco is expecting its customers to buy around a million ice lollies and a million punnets of strawberries.

Emily 
Stuart, Tesco BBQ meats buyer, said: ‘Brits are among the keenest BBQ 
fans in the world but for much of the spring they have been denied the 
pleasure because of dull or rainy weather.

‘Now
 with weathermen predicting the warmest weekend of the year, shoppers 
are wasting no time in stocking up and judging by strong early sales 
many people will be spending the next few days enjoying al fresco dining
 in their gardens.’

Marks & Spencer think the weather 
will sway peoples drink choices and expect to sell 50 per cent more Rose
 compared to last week. While Morrisons predicts it will scan 220lb of 
ice through its checkouts.

Asda said sales of sunglasses were expected to be up 22 per cent this week compared to the same time last year and estimated an extra 15 per cent rise on hat sales – including cowboy, trilbies and caps. It also predicts a boost in the sale of lanterns as people enjoy the longer evenings in the garden.

Mark Wilson, Met Office meteorologist, said: ‘We are going to see a day by day increase in the temperatures. Through the course of today I think we could quite easily see 21C, possibly 22C, in the south east.

‘I think the South East is most likely to see the highest temperatures.’

Mr
 Wilson said by tomorrow temperatures could reach 22C or 23C (73.4F), 
with the greatest chance of this being in the London area.

The
 forecaster said some areas may get near 25C (77F) this weekend and that
 he was ‘pretty confident we will see the warmest day of the year so 
far’.
