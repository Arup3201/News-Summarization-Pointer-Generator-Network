Former swimmer Rebecca Adlington has revealed taking part in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here inspired her to lose weight in time for her wedding with Harry Needs. 

The 25-year-old, who won two gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and bronze at London 2012, decided to retire from professional swimming in February 2013. 

Adlington, who tied the knot with fellow swimmer Harry Needs at The Ashes, near Leek in Staffordshire, told Hello! magazine: ‘I lost nearly two stone in the jungle and perhaps another four or five pounds since then. So it was a great kick start, and I feel better for it.

Adlington said that taking part in 'I’m A Celebrity' last year inspired her to get in shape

‘But I don’t like it when people assume you’re really happy because you’re thin. I’m not suddenly confident because I have lost weight, I’m happy because I’m marrying the love of my life.’ 

In the lead up to the wedding, the former swimmer followed a Harley Street clinic’s weight loss and detox programme.

And she capped it off by spending a week at the clinic’s French retreat, which costs up to £3,295 per person. 

She embarked on a strict programme of vegetable juices, daily yoga and meditation sessions and long walks in the countryside at a secluded chateau in Provence along with her friend, fellow retired swimmer Katherine Wyld.

For the ceremony itself, Adlington, who won two golds at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and two bronzes at London 2012, and Mr Needs, 22, wrote their own vows. And the groom was more nervous than the bride.

‘The ceremony was so personal, which was exactly what we wanted,’ Adlington said. ‘I love the fact Harry was in bits before I even reached him. I was a bit nervous in the car on the way here with my dad, but as soon as I walked in, my nerves melted and I relaxed.’Needs, who lives with his new bride in Stockport, said: ‘I compliment her every single day, because to me she is the most beautiful woman in the world.’
