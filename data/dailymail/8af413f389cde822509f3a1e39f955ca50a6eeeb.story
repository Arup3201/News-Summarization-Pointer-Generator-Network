Newsmaker 

All of a sudden, the San Antonio Spurs own the Western Conference's longest winning streak. With a 117-107 thrashing of the Toronto Raptors, the Spurs have won six straight games behind the contributions of Tony Parker and Kawhi Leonard. Parker totaled 23 points and nine assists, which means he's surpassed the 20-point threshold in each of the Spurs' last three games. San Antonio are 11-2 when Parker compiles at least 20 points this season. Leonard, who posted 24 points, 11 rebounds and five steals, has a similar effect and the Spurs are now 7-0 over the last two seasons when he records a 20-10 game.

Good Week 

It's seemingly a nightly occurrence at this point, but LeBron James made franchise history again on Tuesday evening. En route to racking up eight assists, James passed Mark Price as the Cavaliers' all-time leader in assists. Opting to leave his headband in the locker room, James finished with 27 points (10-of-14 shooting), eight assists and seven rebounds as Cleveland's starting five trounced Dallas' lethargic line-up. Every Cavaliers starter finished with a plus/minus rating of plus-21 or better, and Timofey Mozgov (17 points) was the only member of that group to score fewer than 20 points. J.R. Smith and Kevin Love both scored 21, while Kyrie Irving added 22 points, five rebounds, five assists and two steals. Cleveland are now one game clear of the third-seeded Chicago Bulls in the East.

Bad Week 

The Dallas Mavericks are in a world of hurt, and head coach Rick Carlisle acknowledged as much following that loss to the Cavs. Over the past three weeks, Dallas has posted the worst net rating (minus-5.5) of any current Western Conference play-off qualifier. They are also scoring 96.6 points per 100 possessions which ranks 25th overall since the trade deadline. The Minnesota Timberwolves have recorded an offensive rating of 99.4 in that same span. Dallas still occupies the number seven seed in the West but Oklahoma City can shake things up in a big way if it takes care of business over the season's final month. The Mavs have a five game lead on the Thunder, but play OKC three more times in their final 16 games.

And Finally... 

Jimmy Butler is coming into his own as a leader of the Chicago Bulls, taking up the flag during Derrick Rose's absence. With leadership comes perks, of course, and Butler is making use of his growing role in the franchise, much to the detriment of his team-mates' eardrums. Butler admitted to blasting liberal amounts of country music and Taylor Swift when given control of the music for team warm-ups. 'I get my own playlist in warm-ups sometimes,' Butler said. 'My teammates don't like it very much because it's country music, but they get over it. I like Taylor Swift. I like music a whole, but her music is kinda catchy.'
