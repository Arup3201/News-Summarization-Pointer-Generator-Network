Sacked: Northamptonshire Police Inspector Daemon Johnson who was fired after posting a picture of his genitals of Facebook

A long-serving senior police inspector has been sacked after posting a picture of his genitals on Facebook.

Inspector Daemon Johnson - who had served Northamptonshire Police for 25 years - was fired after shocked officers spotted the explicit photo online.

The experienced officer also sent inappropriate emails and made lewd comments to female members of staff it emerged today.

He was sacked for gross misconduct following an investigation by Northamptonshire Police's professional standards department.

Confirming that an officer had been sacked this week, Superintendent Jan Meagher said: 'We can confirm that an officer appeared before a misconduct hearing in relation to allegations of inappropriate comments to female staff, misuse of the force email system and improper behaviour.

'The matters breached the standards of professional behaviour namely "discreditable conduct" and "equality and diversity".

'The panel decided that the most appropriate outcome was dismissal.

'We expect the highest standards from our officers and staff.

'We will take robust action in cases where we find the standard expected has not been upheld.

'As with all disciplinary hearings, every officer has a right to appeal.'

Johnson is not the first in the UK to be sacked or forced to resign because of Facebook indiscretions.

One officer from Cheshire resigned in October 2010 after being accused of harassing a former partner on Facebook.

And earlier this year four officers from the same force as Inspector Johnson were banned from using Twitter after being caught sending inappropriate messages to each other.

The officers, who were among more than 40 police officers and staff who have been tweeting about their jobs over the past few months, were told to leave the website because they breached force rules.

It came after HMIC inspectors visited the force over this summer to look into how officers were using Twitter and later made recommendations.

At the time a force spokesman said: 'We expect the highest standards from our officers and staff at all times and this is reflected in procedures regarding the use of social media across the force.'
