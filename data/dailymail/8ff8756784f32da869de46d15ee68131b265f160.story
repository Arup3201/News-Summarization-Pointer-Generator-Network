With London Fashion Week kicking off in the capital next week, Samantha Cameron is already flying the flag for one of her favourite designers.

The first lady of fashion showed off her style credentials in a floor length blue Roksanda Ilincic gown as she arrived with her husband, David Cameron, at the annual Conservative Party Black and White Fundraising Ball.

The dress, which costs around £1,000 and features cream and green colour block panels, is part of the Serbian designers Resort 2014 collection.

She's got style! Samantha Cameron was bang on trend in a blue Roksanda Ilincic gown as she arrived at the Conservative Party Black and White Fundraising Ball at Old Billingsgate Market with husband David

Speaking about Samantha's fashion coup, fashion editor Simon Glazin said: 'Roksanda Ilincic’s gowns are instantly recognisable by their bold, bright, colour blocking designs.

'Sam Cam has made it no secret that Roksanda is one of her favourite London-based designers, wearing her dresses to meet the First Lady and to various events with her husband.

'This particular dress is from Roksanda’s Resort 2014 collection, which is now on sale, and retails for over £1000.

'Historically, a designer’s Resort collection (also known as Cruise or Holiday) was aimed at their wealthiest clients, those who enjoyed taking a cruise for their summer holiday.

'Nowadays, it is expected for designers to design a resort range as part of their four seasonal collections. And often the Resort collections are those that are most sold.'

Favourite designer: Samantha often champions the Serbian-born designer, who is also loved by the Duchess of Cambridge 

Support: Former model Jemma Kidd alongside her husband Arthur Wellesley, Earl of Mornington (left). Also in attendance were actress Joan Collins and financial services entrepreneur Ivan Massow (right)

This isn't the first time that Mrs Cameron has donned the designer's clothes and she is not alone in her love of the label - the Duchess of Cambridge 
and Michelle Obama have also worn Roksanda’s creations.

She may be Serbian by blood, but Roksanda Ilincic has been resolutely embraced as one of our own.

The London-based designer has risen swiftly and steeply through fashion's ranks since settling in the capital in 1999.

And
 her ascent has been assisted by some extremely important women, all of 
whom have been busy filling their wardrobes with her vibrant colours and
 statement dresses.

Remember this one? Samantha Cameron wore a turquoise and hot pink creation straight off Roksanda Ilincic's spring/summer 2012 catwalk as she hosted a reception celebrating British fashion

Simple elegance: The Duchess of Cambridge is a fan of Roksanda Ilincic, too

Royalty of the genuine, political and Hollywood variety have all demonstrated their fondness for Ilincic's idiosyncratic and ever-elegant creations.

The Duchess
 of Cambridge, Princess Beatrice, Michelle Obama and 
Tilda Swinton are just some of the sartorially clued-up women to 
appreciate her bold colour-blocking and clean, unfussy lines.

Ilincic - who has confessed to being 
fanatical about Yves Saint Laurent and having some 500 of the brand's 
vintage pieces - must be used to spotting celebrities wearing her 
creations by now.

Princess Beatrice stepped out wearing
her delicious, long-sleeved peach frock - complete with appropriately 
royal blue sleeve tips - at a recent event.

And Hollywood royalty including Penelope Cruz, Emma Stone, Keira 
Knightley and Gwyneth Paltrow have all been photographed in her dresses, which cost from £300 to over £1,000.

Fashion's first ladies: Samantha Cameron and Michelle Obama are both staunch Ilincic supporters

Ilincic, who lives in north London with her husband  Philip Bueno de Mesquita and toddler daughter Efimia, designs four womenswear collections per year.

The former model - who yearned 
to be a ballet dancer when she was growing up, but felt 'too tall and 
awkward' - moved to London to study design after reading about Louise 
Wilson, a teacher at Central Saint Martins.

She
thought to herself: 'If all those big-name designers are coming out of 
the same college, something amazing must be happening.'

The designer: Roksanda Ilincic, who was born in Serbia but has made London her home since 1999

She recently made her 
creations accessible to even more women (and also little girls), designing an
affordable range for high-street department store Debenhams, and a 
unique designer line for children.

Her children's line, Blossom, is a selection of pretty dresses, stretchy tops and bold colours, made for two to eight-year-olds.

The designer plans to create two Blossom 
collections per year, with items on sale at Liberty and on 
AlexandAlexa.com, priced between £135 and £270.

Ilincic's almost-two-year-old daughter modelled the babywear for Blossom's debut line.
