Country superstar Luke Bryan, 38, and his wife have taken in their orphaned nephew after the teen lost both parents unexpectedly.

Luke and his wife Caroline, are now looking after 13-year-old Til following the death of his father, Ben 'Lee 'Cheshire - Luke's brother-in-law - in November. He was 46.

Til lost his mother, Luke's sister Kelly, seven years before when she died suddenly in May 2007 at age 39. Lee had remained close with the Bryan family since then.

Luke's sister Kelly (pictured left with him) died in May 2007, leaving her husband Lee (pictured right) to raise their three children. Lee died in late November 2014 and Luke has taken in their youngest child

The youngest of Lee's three children with Kelly, Til has two older sisters, Jordan and Kris.

Following the death of Til's father, Like moved the boy into his Nashville home to live with him and wife Carolina and their two sons Bo and Tate.   

The 'Play It Again' singer, even took his nephew to the American Country Countdown Awards in December - a few weeks after his father's death - and the teen sat between Luke and Caroline.

Til's older sisters are regular visitors and the Bryan family are helping them get through their loss.

'We feel like if we just stay positive through this, maybe we'll be a positive inspiration for people that had these things happen to 'em,' Bryan told ABC News. 'You just have to plow on and play the hand that's dealt.'

Luke and his wife Caroline have opened their home in Nashville, Tennessee, to Til, 13, who joins them and their own sons Bo and Tate. Til's older sisters Jordan and Kris are regular visitors

Luke canceled an appearance at the CMT Artists of the Year Special, at which he was an honoree, to attend his late brother-in-law's funeral in early December 2014.

The country music community rallied around Luke and his family, and the band Lady Antebellum teamed up with songwriter Chris Stapleton to perform Luke's hit, 'Drink A Beer'.

The song has deep significance for Luke, who recorded it in 2013 in memory of his late sister and his brother, Chris, who died in a car accident in 1996 aged 26.

In February 2014 the song became Luke's seventh number one on the Billboard Country Airplay chart.
