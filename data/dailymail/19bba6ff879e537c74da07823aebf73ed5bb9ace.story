After a string of run-ins with the law, Justin Bieber seems to be taking stock of his life.

And on Thursday night, the troubled 19-year-old took to his social media accounts to thank both his local town Mayor - Dan Mathieson - for supporting him, and his father Jeremy Bieber for being the 'greatest dad in the world'.

The outpouring of appreciation comes as the teen is currently taking a little respite at home in Canada with his father and siblings following a controversial few weeks.

Hometown kid:  The troubled 19-year-old took to his social media accounts to thank both his local town Mayor - Dan Mathieson - for supporting him, and his father Jeremy Bieber for being the 'greatest dad in the world'

'Thanks!' Justin Bieber expressed his appreciation for his local town Mayor's support of him by re-tweeting an article in which Stratford Mayor defends him

Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson made 
his support and sympathy clear for Justin - who is a native of the town -
 and apparently his words resonated with the young star.

The
 Baby singer made his sentiments known in a tweet on Thursday evening, 
writing: 'never forget where you come from or those who supported you 
before anyone else.'

'Still the small town kid. thanks,' the hitmaker wrote, before linking his 49 million followers to an article in the Beacon Herald that details Mathieson's support.

'As far as Iâ€™m concerned, he is a 
19-year-old person who has made some errors,' the Mayor had said, adding:
 'I hope for his sake that he can get a reset, and get back to music and
 doing what he loves.'

'He's taught me how to love, learn, and stay true to myself': Justin posted this photo of his father Jeremy on the same evening, expressing his appreciation for his parenting skills

Justin's arrival home comes as it was confirmed in a toxicology report that he had marijuana and THC and Alprazolam (key ingredients in anti-anxiety drugs such as Xanax) in his system at the time of his Miami arrest.

Perhaps
 a little time at home with the family could be just what the doctor 
ordered for the teen, as his tweet is the first reference he has made to
 the troublesome saga since it began.

Later
 in the evening, Justin hopped on Instagram and shared a photo of his 
father Jeremy, smiling at the camera whilst wearing a Batman beanie.

'I have the greatest Dad in the 
world,' he claimed in the caption. 'He's taught me how to love, learn, 
and stay true to myself. I will forever be grateful because he was my 
superehero #batman'

And
 in yet another outward expression of gratitude and love in the midst of
 the mayhem, Justin tweeted about how great it was to be hanging out 
with his siblings.

Safe and sound? Justin Bieber's father Jeremy Bieber posted a photo of the hitmaker sleeping soundly alongside his little brother Jaxon

'Lovin on @JaxonBieber and @JazmynBieber,' he wrote on the social networking site, adding a sweet and simple hashtag: '#FAMILY.'

Justin's controversial few weeks 
have included DUI charges, testing positive to marijuana and Xanax - 
according to TMZ - and assault charges over an altercation with a Canada
 limo driver.

But
 his father Jeremy - who has faced accusations over his own parenting 
skills of late after allegedly partying with the youngster in the midst 
of the madness - posted a relaxed snap of the star sleeping peacefully 
alongside his younger brother Jaxon.

The
 Love Me singer's model friend Carmen Ortega, however, told MailOnline 
on Wednesday that she personally feared he 'could wind up dead' on 
account of his current state of being.
