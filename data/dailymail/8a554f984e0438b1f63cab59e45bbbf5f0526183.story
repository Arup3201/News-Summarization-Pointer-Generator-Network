A dog who was born with differently coloured eyes is having trouble leaving a rehoming shelter because potential owners can't see past her condition.

Molly the collie arrived at the Dogs Trust in Newbury, Berkshire, with her near identical sister Holly a month ago.

But while Holly quickly found a new home, Molly has struggled and staff believe it is because she has one blue and one brown eye.

Molly, a one-year-old collie, has one blue and one brown eye, caused by a condition called heterochromia

The one-year-old dog is happy and healthy with her blue eye having less pigment than normal in it, a condition known as heterochromia.

Actor Kiefer Sutherland and actresses Mila Kunis, Jane Seymour and Kate Bosworth are all affected by the condition, though the differences between their eyes are not as pronounced as with Molly.

Jane Seymour has heterochromia, with one brown and one green eye 

Native American myth is thought to hold that dogs with two eye colours can see both heaven and earth.

The lack of pigment does not affect Molly's sight.

Staff at Dogs Trust are appealing for someone to come forward and stop the friendly pet and her pale blue eye from lingering around too much longer.

Nicki Barrow, from the centre, said: 'Molly and Holly arrived at the same time, they are both sweet, playful girls of the exact same age.

'They were both looking for similar homes so there is no reason that Molly would be left behind, other than her unusual eye colour.

'It’s baffling as she is a fantastic dog and we think her blue eye makes her look really striking.' 

Molly is described as an 'affectionate girl' who loves nothing more than playing. 

Dogs Trust says she is best suited to an adult-only home with a secure garden, ideally in a rural location so she can enjoy plenty of exercise.

Nicki added: 'Molly loves company so she would like to find a home with another dog who can act as her doggy guide and help her settle in quickly.

'We really hope a new owner can see behind Molly’s blue eye and offer her a happy home, just like her sister Holly.

'We think Molly is a dog in a million and we really hope she catches the eye of a loving new owner soon.'
