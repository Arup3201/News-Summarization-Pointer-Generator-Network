Dreams of stardom: Simone Reed, who stripped to her underwear in the middle of a Jobcentre in a Neknomination dare, has now auditioned for X Factor

A young mother who stripped to her underwear in the middle of a Jobcentre in a Neknomination dare has set her sights on more than just internet notoriety by auditioning for X Factor.

Simone Reed made headlines at the height of the Neknomination craze after she walked into a branch of Jobcentre Plus and shed her coat to reveal her bra, knickers and stockings.

The mother-of-two said that despite having initial regrets about the dare in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, she is now embracing the exposure it gave her as she bids for X Factor fame.

Ms Reed, 25, says she has already made
 it through the first auditions for the ITV talent search and is now waiting 
to hear if she has made it onto the live shows.

It would be a far cry from her online strip show, which she said she had immediately regretted.

'The minute I did it I regretted it straight away. I didn’t even put it on the internet.'

The film footage, posted on Facebook, 
showed her disrobing while claiming she is protesting against sanctions to 
her jobseeker's allowance.

In the clip she is quickly thrown out of the job centre by a security officer, who
 can be heard telling her to 'grow up' as she is thrown out, just before
 her coat is thrown out as well.

She was then seen outside the office, drinking from a can and nominating someone else to do the challenge.

Ms Reed said the clip had been posted online by a friend.

'It was just a bit of a laugh,' she said.

'I am game to do a bit of everything. It went viral and global, in every newspaper across the world. It even reached China.'

She now says that stripping off for the camera has provided her with something of an un-dress rehearsal for a life in the spotlight.

'I don’t regret it now. I am glad I done it.'

Ms Reed says it has led to her doing 'topless glamour' for the Daily Sport newspaper and auditioning for X Factor.

But she said she had been 'terrified' during her first audition for the hit television show's 11th series, which is set to welcome back judges Simon Cowell and Cheryl Cole.

'I sang a song called The Power of Love by Celine Dion,' she said.

'I was really nervous. I crumbled. I didn’t even hit the note properly.'
