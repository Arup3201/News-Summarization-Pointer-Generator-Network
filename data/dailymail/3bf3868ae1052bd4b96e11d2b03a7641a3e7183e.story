A motorist caught running red lights and swerving between lanes claimed he was 'under the influence' of drum and bass music.

Delivery driver Aaron Cogley, 25, said he was 'high' on the 'intoxicating effects' of his favourite music, which he said made him drive erratically.

Police spotted him running two sets of red lights in Bristol and then 'cut up' another driver.

Aaron Cogley was banned from driving for 12 months at Bristol Crown Court, pictured, after he admitted dangerous driving but said it was because of the 'intoxicating' effects of drum and base

Bristol Crown Court was told Cogley then rounded a corner so sharply his van rocked on its chassis.

Officers pulled him over but he passed a drink and drugs test.

When asked why he was driving erratically he blamed his drum and bass.

Cogley, of Portishead, Bristol, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and his defence team argued he had been 'intoxicated' by the music.

David Miller, defending, said: 'It was stupid. He was carried away because of the intoxicating effects of drum and bass music.'

Passing sentence, Recorder Mr Kevin De Haan QC described drum and bass as 'Intoxicating for some. Very irritating for others.'

Cogley was ordered to do 80 hours unpaid work, was banned from driving for 12 months and ordered to pass an extended driving test and pay a Â£60 victim surcharge.

Mark Hollier, prosecuting, said police in an unmarked car spotted Cogley driving his Ford van in the streets near Bristol Royal Infirmary.

He 'cut up' a motorist, drove slowly through two sets of red lights before swerving from lane to lane as he headed towards a train station.

Police rushed the vehicle and Cogley was arrested and breathalysed, but blew a zero reading.

Mr Hollier said: 'When asked about it he said he was listening to drum and bass and was in a hurry.'

Recorder Haan QC told Cogley: 'It's always serious, dangerous driving.

'Even if you only went up to 40mph you were lucky that night.

'You could have had an accident and been hurt, or worse you could have hurt someone else. Police thought you had taken something.'

The court heard that Cogley would now lose his job as a delivery driver.
