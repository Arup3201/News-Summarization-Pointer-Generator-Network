A couple has been handed a £900 bill from Virgin Media for pornography over a five-year period - despite the fact that they insist they have never ordered any.

Ann, 72, and Ron Hayward, 75, who live in a one-bedroom bedsit in Stockport, Cheshire, now have no internet or television because the provider have accused the couple of 'abusing' services.

The great-grandparents first received a bill for almost £200 in 2009, and another £200 last week. They were also sent another letter ordering them to pay more than £500 for blue films.

Adult channels paid for through Virgin media cost £5.99 for a 16 hour period.

Users can also buy a monthly subscription package to channels such as Playboy TV for a monthly fee of £11.

For the price of the bill, the couple could have watched 150 16-hour stints through different channels or a total of 2,404 hours of pornography - the equivalent of 100 days.

But the pensioners, who live in a quiet housing block for elderly residents, were adamant they had never ordered, let alone watched, the pornographic films.

The company then agreed to waive the bills and said they would remove the ‘on demand’ feature.

It was not until they upgraded their service to Virgin’s latest 'TiVo' box last month that they reluctantly agreed to reactivate their on demand services, and problems resurfaced.

Mrs Hayward said: 'Because of what happened before, we were reluctant to have the on demand services switched back on - even though we were paying the full cost for them the entire time'

The TiVo box allows viewers to record up to 500 hours of television.

Mrs Hayward, 72, said: 'Because of what happened before, we were reluctant to have the on demand services switched back on - even though we were paying the full cost for them the entire time.

'The lady I spoke to promised me that we had absolutely nothing to worry about and that there was no way it could happen again.

'After a couple of days a message appeared on the TV saying ‘channels unavailable’ and I had a feeling something wasn’t right - that’s one of the things that happened the last time.

'I started to get a bit worried so I called them the next day, just to be told that I had ordered more than £200 worth of films.

'I was in complete shock - I just couldn’t believe it was happening to us all over again after they reassured us that everything would be okay.'

Last week, the elderly couple received another bill for watching dozens of 18-rated films a day - costing more than £200.

Virgin staff have now told the Haywards that all of their services will be cancelled because ‘they are abusing the service’ - and they have until 9th May to find a new provider for their telephone, broadband and TV.

Retired nursery nurse Mrs Hayward said: 'I told them I’m not paying a penny of these bills - they insist it is us, but they won’t even tell us what time the films have supposedly been downloaded.

'I just feel like I am being ignored and it makes me so mad that this big company can just brush off their customers like that.

'Just because they can’t find a solution to the problem they are going to cancel all of our services - it is so stressful and frustrating for us.

'We are retired and in our 70s, we can’t afford to pay out to have everything installed again.'

The pair has a large family with five sons, 12 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren but both Mr and Mrs Hayward are adamant that no one else has had access to the television.

To watch adult films through Virgin, the user has to enter an adult pincode.

Mrs Hayward added: 'We live alone in a small bedsit, in a secure residential complex - no one else has access to our flat.

Mrs Hayward said: 'Just because they can't find a solution to the problem they are going to cancel all of our services - it is so stressful and frustrating for us.'

'If we lived in a big house with a big family then maybe I could understand it, as you couldn’t know what was happening in every room.

'You wouldn’t believe the conversations we have had to have with our family, friends and neighbours about it all.

'There is obviously something wrong with the technology or someone somewhere is hacking into our services, and if it can happen to us it can happen to anyone.

'Virgin just keep insisting that the 
films have been bought using our box and that it must be us doing it. 
But it isn’t as if someone has been sneaking in and out of our flat.

'The
 whole situation is just ridiculous. I am just completely gobsmacked, 
they were supposed to have made the situation better for us, but they 
have just made it worse.'

Dana Hashem, from Virgin Media, said: 'These films were unquestionably watched by someone in the Haywards’ home.

'We are happy to arrange a payment plan but have said they may want to find an alternative provider going forward.'
