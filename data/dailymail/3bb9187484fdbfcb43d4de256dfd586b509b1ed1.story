A picture of the British boy scout who died during a canyoning expedition in the Italian Alps has now been released.

Elliot Alexander Peacock, 14, emerged from the water unconscious as the youth group carried out training exercises in the Lillaz waterfalls, police said. 

As his horrified friends watched, instructors supervising the adventure holiday attempted to revive him.

The schoolboy emerged from the water unconscious after an ill-judged dive at the Lillaz waterfalls and despite several supervising instructors coming to his rescue he was unable to be revived

Mountain rescue guides believe the teenager, from Glasgow, may have received internal injuries after hitting a rock while diving into a pool between two waterfalls

A helicopter arrived on the scene within minutes but after two hours the teenager was declared dead.

Rescue workers said the youth, from Glasgow, may have hit his chest on rocks in an ill-judged dive.

He was travelling with a group of 40 children aged between 10 and 17 and was a member of the Eastwood District Scouts.

The trip to the Valle D'Aosta was organised by UK-based company called Acorn Adventures which organises adventure holidays for schools and youth groups.

They had arrived at the waterfalls at an altitude of 1800m by coach from their accommodation in the village of Villeneuve.

A spokesman for the Guardia di Finanza 
police in Courmayeur, who are investigating the cause of the tragic 
accident, said: 'The boy was on holiday with an adventure group of 40 
young people.They were playing games in a waterfall.

'When he re-emerged from the water he was unconscious.

'There were five instructors in the water and they immediately tried to revive him but they were unable to do so.

'We are carrying out interviews to find out if anyone saw him dive or hit rocks.'

Mountain rescue guide, Dante Bibois, said the teenager, who was wearing a helmet and wetsuit, may have received internal injuries after hitting a rock diving into a pool between two waterfalls.

He told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera: 'There was a lot of water in the river- and the current was strong. There are lots of rocks.'

'He had no visible external injuries - so he may have hit his chest on rocks as he dove.'

The Scout Association said it was 'devastated' by the death at the Lillaz waterfalls and was working with Acorn Adventure to support the victim's family

The schoolboy's parents were expected to arrive in the area today, police said.

The autopsy will be carried out this week.

Acorn Adventure, said of the accident: 'They were jumping into the water, where instructors were waiting for them. All participants were wearing buoyancy aids, wet suits  and helmets as is standard on this activity, carried out by hundreds of participants every year for the past 18 years.

'As yet it is unclear why this participant lost consciousness as he entered the water. Despite very swiftly being given CPR by trained first aiders and nurses who attended the scene, very sadly paramedics were unable to resuscitate him.'

The outdoor education provider added: 'The thoughts and condolences of all at Acorn Adventure are with his family and friends; the team's efforts are fully focused on ensuring they are supported in any way possible.'

Acorn Adventure said it is working with the Italian emergency services and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to ensure the teenager is brought home to his family 'swiftly and respectfully'.

Senior operations staff were travelling to Italy to provide all possible support, the company said.

The boy was a member of the Pegasus Explorer Scout Unit which is linked to the 35th Glasgow Scout Group.

In a statement the Scout Association said: 'We are working with Acorn Adventure to support the family, leaders and other young people involved in this very sad event.

'We are devastated that a young person has died and our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of the young person at this time.'

The Foreign Office said they were aware of the death and were ready to provide consular assistance.
