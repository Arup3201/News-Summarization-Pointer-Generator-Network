A violin-playing pensioner has told how he feared he would lose his fingers after being mauled by a Japanese Akita in a 'horrendous' attack outside his late-daughter's home.

John Onyett, 76, was visiting the house in Leeds, West Yorkshire, when his arms, hands and legs were ripped open by the savage dog. 

The retired teacher was left with such severe injuries that he
 thought he would have to miss his daughter Andrea's funeral.

John Onyett, 76, was left with wounds to his arms, hands and leg after being mauled by a Japanese Akita in a 'horrendous' attack outside his late daughter's home in Leeds

The pensioner had been forced to spend one week in hospital where he underwent surgery to repair the horrific wounds.

But he was temporarily released from Leeds Royal Infirmary so he could attend the service. His daughter died after struggling with alcoholism for several years.

The dog - which belonged to a man who used to live with his daughter - is now due to be destroyed.

No arrests have been made because the incident took place on private land and the dog is not a banned breed.

Mr Onyett, who has eight grandchildren, said: 'I was so upset that I might have to miss the funeral because of what happened.

'I don't remember a lot - only feeling like my arm was going to be ripped off and being in terrible pain.

'If
 it had been a child, I've no doubt their arm would have come straight 
off. I play the violin and I was terrified of losing my fingers.

'It
 was horrendous, I literally didn't know what to do. Every time I moved 
my arm, the dog bit harder. The more frantic I got, the more excited the
 dog became.'

Several neighbours came to Mr Onyett's rescue and had to bat away the dog with a garden fork. Police arrived and removed the animal.

The pensioner is now calling for dog owners to be licensed.

He said: 'A dog isn't inherently dangerous, it's all to do with the way it is treated. There has to be some form of control.'

West Yorkshire Police confirmed the animal that attacked him was due to be destroyed.
