A new round of images of the hunt for the Boston bombing suspects released by a police photographer reveal the moment that SWAT officers seized Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - along with other insider moments from before and after the teen's arrest.

Sergeant Sean Murphy, a tactical photographer for the Massachusetts State Police, had a front-row seat to the dramatic capture of the fugitive who shut down the entire city of Boston on April 19.

His pictures documented the moment that the 19-year-old terrorism suspect climbed out of the boat in a backyard in suburban Watertown, Massachusetts and gave himself up.

Dramatic: This is the moment that SWAT officers pounced on Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev after he climb out of the boat where he was hiding in Watertown, Massachusetts

Surrender: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is bloodied and appears dazed as he climbs out of the boat where he was hiding in Watertown, Massachusetts. He lifts his shirt to show that he is unarmed

Medic! Officers and paramedics work to stabilize Tsarnaev. He was shot multiple times when officers fired 100 rounds into his hiding place

Tsarnaev suffered severe head and facial injuries and substantial blood loss when he was shot multiple times. However, he recovered and it currently facing numerous charges for the April 15 blast that killed three

The images also showed the frantic 
hunt for Tsarnaev after he escaped during a bloody gun battle with 
police early that morning that left his brother Tamerlan dead. The 
search spread across the entire greater Boston area and set the nation on edge.

Sgt Murphy handed his pictures from April 19 to Boston Magazine in July because he was furious that the baby-faced Tsarnaev was being glamorized by Rolling Stone magazine, which had published his picture on its cover.

'I hope that the people who see these images will know that this was real. It was as real as it gets. This may have played out as a television show, but this was not a television show,' he wrote.

'What Rolling Stone did was wrong. This guy is evil. This is the real Boston bomber. Not someone fluffed and buffed for the cover of Rolling Stone magazine.'

Boston Magazine published a second set of Sgt Murphy's images in the September issue. They were released online today.

Sgt Murphy, a 25-year veteran of the state police, has paid dearly for leaking his pictures. He was condemned by the U.S. Attorney prosecuting Tsarnaev.

Heavily armed: Armored SWAT officers from local and state police teamed up with federal agents to approach the boat where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was hiding out. He was unarmed, but authorities thought he was equipped with guns and bombs at the time

He was reprimanded and nearly fired - though a wave of public support may have allowed him to keep his job.

Boston Magazine reports that he had been transferred far away from Boston to Athol, Massachusetts, a small state police post in the northern part of the state.

He's currently working the 11pm to 7am graveyard shift - despite being a veteran on the force.

Murphy has been labeled a 'hero' for 
his actions by many with popular option - especially in Boston - that he
 did the right thing to counter act the cover of the current issue of Rolling Stone which was widely perceived to have 'glamorized' Tsarnaev.

Murphy's
 actions have received a lot of support on social media platforms, more 
than 10,000 people have 'liked' a 'Save Sgt. Sean Murphy' Facebook page and supporters have also taken to Twitter to call him a hero.

Federal prosecutors however were quick to voice their displeasure at Murphy’s actions.

'The release of these photos was completely unacceptable,'
 said a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz, whose prosecutors
 are preparing a case against Tsarnaev on 30 federal charges, 17 of them
 capital offenses.

'We 
have spoken with the Massachusetts State Police, who have assured us 
that the release of the photos was unauthorized and that they are taking
 action internally in response.'

It
 is unclear whether the photos could damage the federal case against the
 man accused of setting off pressure cooker bombs that killed three 
people and injured more than 260.

Murphy accompanied the Swat teams as 
they descended on a boat in the backyard of a Watertown home, where 
Tsarnaev sought refuge following one of the biggest manhunts in U.S. 
history.

Rolling Stone magazine has failed to apologize over its latest cover which has been accused of glamorizing Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev
