She may only be 21, but Nina Agdal has already landed a Sport's Illustrated cover, huge commercials and even a reported date with Hollywood heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio.

And now the Danish model is making her high street campaign debut for London-born store Accessorize.

The brand, which is celebrating its 30th birthday year, called on the hot new face to showcase its SS14 range.

New face: Nina Agdal showcases her model looks and enviable body as the new face of Accessorize SS14 campaign

Shot in sunny Los Angeles, campaign photographer Ben Weller shot Agdal in a series of holiday poses styled by former Harper's Bazaar stylist, Naomi Miller.

But what's the secret behind the enviable bikini body that has won her both Victoria's Secret and Sports Illustrated fame?

'I try to work out at least four times a
 week for an hour,' she told MailOnline.

'I personally enjoy going to Barry's Bootcamp; it's 
such a great work out. It's hard but afterwards you feel like you can 
take over the world.'

Much to the annoyance of the majority of the female population, Agdal told us she doesn't overly worry about what she eats.

She works out: The 21-year-old says she tries to work out at least 4 times a week for an hour - it certainly pays off!

'I
 wouldn't say I'm strict but I'm aware of what I eat. I eat what I want, and
 I love food but if I have a burger for dinner I'll eat healthy the next
 day and work out. It's all about moderation,' she said.

The model, who follows in the footsteps of former Accessorize famous faces Kate Upton, Tamsin Egerton, Claudia Schiffer, Lily Cole and Bar Rafaeli, said she can't really be picky about food since she travels so much.

'I make sure to take vitamin C and drink water. That's about it,' she said of her healthy regime.

Au natural: Agdal says she prefers to go natural and only wears minimal make-up when she isn't shooting campaigns

All things bright and beautiful: Agdal showcases her natural beauty as she models the colourful new range for Accessorize

As is clear from the campaign imagery, Agdal is a natural beauty, revealing she only carries L'Oreal's mascara, Clinique's foundation (which she uses as a 
concealer), CK One's skin illuminator and a good lip balm in her make-up bag.

The model, who recently called time on her relationship with The Wanted's Max George, has big things in the pipeline.

She said: 'Sports Illustrated Swimsuit has definitely pushed my career. Since I don't have to sell a product it's all about me just being me, which is relaxing as a model.

'This
 whole year is exciting to me. There are so many things I want to do. I 
take one day at a time but hopefully I'll be able to keep improving 
myself and my career.'

Body secret: Agdal works out at Barry's Bootcamp, where Jessica Alba and Kim Kardashian have also worked out

The future is bright: She may only be 21, but says there is so much more that she wants to do in the coming years

What diet? Nina Agdal, fronting a campaign here for Carl's Jr. Hardees, says she is partial to a burger but will always work out the next day if she does indulge
