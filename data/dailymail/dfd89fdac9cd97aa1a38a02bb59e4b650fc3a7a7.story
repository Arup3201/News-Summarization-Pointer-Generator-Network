Fraudster: David Brice, 48, preyed on women on dating websites

A conman who swindled thousands of pounds from vulnerable women he picked up on online dating sites was on bail for a similar crime when he committed the frauds.

David Brice, 48, targeted women across Britain and charmed them into handing over more than £7,800 in cash and possessions by gaining their trust.

Bristol Crown Court heard he defrauded the women while on bail from a three-year jail term for 'carbon copies' of the latest crimes.

Three years ago,  Brice conned nearly £17,000 from women he had struck up an online relationship with.

Brice, a self-employed tyre fitter, cried in the dock as he was jailed for four years after pleading guilty to six charges of fraud and one of theft, having swindled more than £7,809 from five more victims.

Recorder David Evans told Brice: ‘You have a long, shameful history of stealing from and deceiving people for your own gain.

‘It seems clear that it is more than greed that motivates you. You have acknowledged that deceiving others out of their property gives you a perceived thrill.

‘In other words, you actually enjoy deceiving others. That is a most disgraceful character trait and one that you show no sign of casting off.’

Brice, of St George, Bristol, was jailed for three years in May 2010 after admitting nine charges of fraud and six of theft for swindling almost £17,000 from women he met on dating websites.

Upon his release, he returned to several online dating sites and followed the same pattern as before to carry out near identical offences, the court was told.

His plan fell apart after failing to con a woman of her car and cash.

Brice picked up a Norfolk woman, referred to in court as Brenda, on dating website Smooch, and posed as a charming Good Samaritan, telling her he would help her swap her broken car through a friend.

Taking him up on his fake promise, 'Brenda' drove to Bristol and paid Brice £150 for repairs to her car, then took him out for dinner, where he asked for a further £100.

Brice drove Brenda to her sister’s home in Newport and promised the Ford Fiesta would follow, but vanished when she refused to pay a further £350.

Police were called and Brice was arrested, prosecutor Ian Fenny said.

Cruel con: Brice was jailed for four years by Bristol Crown Court after admitting to re-offending and conning five women out of more than £7,800

Mr Fenny added: ‘He was continuing to offend while on bail for that matter. He continued to offend after his appearance before this very court where he entered a guilty plea.’

Another women, Rosemary, met Brice on the Plenty of Fish site, where he had the username ‘alwaysgrinning1’, and the couple arranged to meet at a B&Q car park in Yate, Gloucestershire, in April this year.

Brice extracted £1,000 from Rosemary after telling her he needed the money to set up a fast food business, after which he returned to beg for a new computer and a mobile phone.

Brice then disappeared and moved on to another woman, named as Carol, on dating site Oasis, claiming to be a fireman.

On April 15, Brice met Carol in a Tesco car park in Eastville, Bristol, and persuaded her to hand over her daughter’s laptop before claiming he was tired and leaving.

He charmed his third victim, Sylvia, a  57-year-old from Reading suffering from MS, on Plenty of Fish under another username.

Sylvia paid for a hotel room and lent Brice £1,800, which she withdrew with her credit card at a cashpoint.

Watching her from behind, Brice saw her pin code and later used the card to withdraw around £200, Mr Fenny told the court.

Pickup-lines: Brice used online dating sites such as smooch.com to look for vulnerable women whom he could con out of money and possessions

Victim number four, Jill, who has learning difficulties, met ‘davethehappy1’ on Plenty of Fish and arranged to meet him on August 5 in Bristol.

Yet again, his 'date' paid for a hotel room after which he persuaded her to withdraw £300 in cash.

Looking for a way to get his hands on more of Jill's money, he ‘told her she was the one’, before the pair embarked on a £2,100 spending spree around the city.

Mr Fenny said: ‘The spending spree involved the purchase of expensive items, items of jewellery, cigarettes and computers.’

Final victim Marie also met Brice on Plenty of Fish and he offered to fix her £2,409 moped. Brice collected the moped and a laptop, then vanished.

‘The complainants in this case are all in different ways vulnerable women,’ Mr Fenny said. ‘They are all mature women. One has learning difficulties, two have physical disabilities.

‘They were all looking for friendship through the internet. That was a frailty which the defendant preyed on.

‘They were anxious to find a relationship. This defendant - clearly in the eyes of many women - is very plausible. That has the hallmarks of a professional fraudster, which we say he is.’

Mr Fenny said Brice had 30 previous convictions dating back to 1984, including offences of theft, kidnapping, deception, burglary and fraud.

Defending Brice, David Martin said his client did not exploit the women romantically or sexually.

‘In fact, one of the women went very close and was denied,’ Mr Martin said.

He said Brice was a potential kidney donor for his partner Rachel and the couple had a ‘close relationship’.

‘It is like an addiction,’ Mr Martin said. ‘He can’t stop it. He has to stop it or he is going to spend the rest of his life in prison.

‘He said to me, ‘this is the last time, I am not doing this again, I feel genuine remorse for what I have put these women through’.’

But the judge told Brice: ‘I regard your word as utterly worthless.’

The victims full names were withheld from court for their protection.
