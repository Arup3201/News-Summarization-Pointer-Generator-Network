It's been more than 20 years since the original cast of Saved By The Bell walked the halls of Bayside High School.

But on Wednesday evening Mario Lopez - who played A.C. Slater on the popular 90s sitcom - was joined by his former co-stars for a reunion on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

The show's heartthrob was joined by fellow hunk Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Zack Morris), the beautiful Elizabeth Berkley (Jessie Spano) and Tiffani Thiessen (Kelly Kapowski), as well as Dennis Haskins (Principal Belding).

Hooray! On Wednesday evening the former cast of Saved By The Bell reunited for a hilarious skit on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon

Missing from the line-up was Dustin Diamond (Screech) and a Lark Voorhies (Lisa). 

Dustin is accused of stabbing a man during a bar fight on Christmas, while Lark has withdrawn from the limelight as she is reportedly battling bipolar disorder.

During the evening Lopez took to Instagram to share behind-the-scenes snaps with his nearly 400,000 followers.

Where was Screech? Dustin Diamond was recently charged with 'second-degree recklessly endangering safety, disorderly conduct and carrying a concealed weapon'; pictured in his mug shot (L) and in 1993 (R)

Missing: Lark Voorhies who played Lisa (Screech's love interest) was absent from the reunion as she is reportedly battling mental illness, pictured in LA in May

In the photos, the 41-year-old Extra host barely looked a day older than his teenage self, wearing a pair of high-waisted bleached trousers and a bright blue short-sleeve shirt with black vintage print.

Mario even showcased his former trademark hairstyle - curly locks with a mullet-like section in the back.

In one of the pictures he is seen posing beside Gosselaar - who models spray-painted blonde hair.

Flashdance? While in character for their skit, Mario busted out some impressive ballet moves 

One on the way: Then, Tiffani Thiessen (Kelly Kapowski) appears and announces she's pregnant, showing off a baby bump. The actress is currently expecting her second child, a boy, with husband Brady Smith

Nothing has changed: Jessie confuses Slater with an emotional outburst

The Franklin & Bash actor, 40, also donned his respective character's wardrobe - khaki trousers, a blue print shirt and a salmon button-up shirt over top - for the realistic parody.

In their hilarious skit the group of stars are  joined by a new Bayside High student - Jimmy Fallon.

As Jimmy stands at his locker he begins talking with Gosselaar and soon the duo are joined by Mario dressed as Slater.

Spinning for joy: Mario showed off his incredible physique in a leotard

Oh oh! The 'students' are then confronted by the school's principal Belding, played by Haskins

He walks in with a too-cool-for-school gait and greets them with, 'What's up, preppies?'. 

Team spirit: The five friends bonded as they discussed future plans

Hurrah! The parody came to a close as they all leaped for joy

The three guys begin discussing the upcoming 'big Valentine's Day dance' and who they're each bringing as a date.

A short time later they are joined by Mario's former flame from the show, Berkley.

Mario rips off his attire, revealing a skintight black leotard, as he performs an impressive ballet dance.

High school sweethearts: Tiffani posted a photo with her former on-screen love on her Instagram (L) which proved they hadn't aged a bit since 1991 (R)

Spot the difference! Elizabeth (L) didn't look a day older than she did while filming the show in 1991 (R)

Better with age: Mario was looking leaner and perhaps even younger 25 years later

Shortly after, Gosselaar receives a phone call from his beloved girlfriend, Kelly, played by Tiffani.

As they wait for Kelly to arrive Jimmy confesses that he is moving to New York City. He says, 'I love it here but I want to be on Saturday Night Live. Host my own talk show, who knows, maybe one day, date Nicole Kidman'.

The comedian pokes fun at himself following a recent awkward revelation on his show, in which Kidman said she had been interested in dating the star many years ago but thought he wasn't interested in return.

The 'students' are then confronted by the school's principal Belding, played by Haskins.

Reunited: Mario - who played A.C. Slater - and Mark-Paul Gosselaar - who played Zach Morris - were each dressed in their former character's favorite garb

Former TV flame: Mario also posed with co-star Elizabeth Berkley - also known as Jessie Spano - who he dated on the television programme

After he leaves Tiffani joins them in the hall way where she  announces she's pregnant, showing off a baby bump in her cheerleading uniform.

The actress is currently expecting her second child, a boy, with husband Brady Smith. The couple already has a four-year-old daughter Harper. 

Diamond and his fiancee Amanda Schutz were arrested on December 25. 

He was charged with 'second-degree recklessly endangering safety, disorderly conduct and carrying a concealed weapon', according to People. 

Throwback: Mario Lopez shared the behind-the-scenes snaps to his nearly 400k Instagram followers

Back to school: Elizabeth cuddles up to Mark-Paul

Meanwhile, Diamond's onscreen love interest Voorhies (Lisa)  has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, according to her mother. 

Lark, now 38, has largely shied away from the spotlight following her tenure on Saved By The Bell, which wrapped in 1993, unlike her co-stars.

Her mother told People Magazine in October: ‘There are things that have traumatised her. I care deeply about my daughter and I want her to resume her life.’

Also backstage: Mario then shared a picture with LA Lakers basketball star Kobe Bryant, who has been recovering from surgery on his shoulder

Special guests: Mario saved a snap of the Saved By The Bell signage from backstage of The Tonight Show

The 64-year-old shares a home with her daughter, who found fame aged 15, in Pasadena, California.

But it seems Lark is not willing to face up to her condition. When asked by the magazine if she is suffering from any chronic condition including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, she responded: ‘Oh no. We’re alive in a major time of all-in-all prophecy.’

The Jehovah’s Witness also said her long lapses of silence during conversations were merely moments in which she is praying, and added: ‘I have a strong spiritual sense.’
