A furious member of O J Simpson's legal team has reacted angrily to claims that the lead defence attorney in his murder trial case tampered with a key piece of evidence, a glove, helping him to walk away a free man.

Alan Dershowitz responded with outrage to the allegations made by former assistant prosecutor Christopher Darden on Thursday, when he accused the late Johnnie Cochran of 'manipulating' one of the infamous gloves that the prosecution claimed linked him to murder.

On Friday, Dershowitz called the claim 'a total fabrication' adding that the defence would never have had access to a piece of evidence outside of the courtroom.

'Having made the greatest legal blunder of the 20th century,' Dershowitz said of Darden, speaking to NBC News. 'He's trying to blame it on the dead man.'

Darden's shock at the allegations was echoed by fellow attorney Shawn Holley in an email to the Los Angeles Times.

'As members of the defense team, Carl
Douglas and I were present in court on the day that Chris Darden asked 
O.J. Simpson to try on the glove,' she wrote.

'Mr Darden's self-serving assertion that Johnnie Cochran tampered with the glove or any piece of evidence is false, malicious and slanderous,' said Shawn Holley (pictured)

'Mr Darden's self-serving assertion 
that Johnnie Cochran tampered with the glove or any piece of evidence is
false, malicious and slanderous.

'Almost 20 years later, it seems Mr 
Darden is still trying to exculpate himself from one of the biggest 
blunders in the history of jurisprudence.'

Nearly seventeen years ago, former NFL star and actor O.J. Simpson was shockingly acquitted of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.

After 'The Juice' struggled to fit 
the gloves on his hands – in one of the defining moments of the racially
charged trial that captivated the nation – Cochran famously admonished 
the jury: 'If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.'

On Thursday Los Angeles deputy district attorney Christopher Darden made his allegations of tampering during a panel discussion about the trial at Pace Law School in New York City.

'I think Johnnie tore the lining,' he declared.

'There were some additional tears in the lining so that O.J.'s fingers couldn't go all the way up into the glove.'

Darden said in a follow-up interview 
on Friday that he noticed that when Simpson was trying on a glove for 
the jury its structure appeared to have changed.

'A bailiff told me the defence had it during the lunch hour.' He said 
he wasn't specifically accusing anyone, adding: 'It's been my suspicion 
for a long time that the lining has been manipulated.'

He said he had previously voiced similar concerns in TV interviews, but could not recall the details.Darden's incendiary charge surprised key participants in the trial and related legal action.

Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, who was a member of Simpson's 
defence team, and Paul Callan, who represented Nicole Brown Simpson's 
estate in a successful civil trial against Simpson, said it was the 
first time they had ever heard the allegation.

On
Friday, Dershowitz called the claim that the defence had an opportunity
to tamper with the gloves 'a total fabrication' and said 'the defence 
doesn't get access to evidence except under controlled circumstances.'

'Having
made the greatest legal blunder of the 20th Century,' Dershowitz said 
of Darden, 'he's trying to blame it on the dead man.'

Darden's remarks came after 
Dershowitz, a fellow panellist, called Darden's decision to have Simpson
try on the glove for the first time before the jury 'the most stupid 
thing' a prosecutor could have done.

Dershowitz
said that if Darden had evidence that there had been tampering, he 
would have had an ethical obligation to report the alleged misconduct.

He also questioned why Darden hadn't filed a grievance with the state bar association.

Darden
responded by saying that this would have been a 'whiny-little-snitch 
approach to life' and that was not what he believed in because it didn't
change anything.

The event
was part of a 'Trials and Errors' series, co-sponsored by Pace Law 
School and the Forum on Law, Culture & Society at Fordham Law, that 
examines America's most controversial cases.

Also on the panel were Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, and his sister, Kim Goldman.

Derek
Sells, the managing partner of Cochran's old law firm, The Cochran 
Firm, did not respond to requests for comment. A call to Cochran's 
daughter, Tiffany Cochran Edwards, who is a communications director for 
the firm, was not immediately returned. 

Cochran died in 2005 from a brain tumour at age 67.

Simpson was acquitted in the double murder case despite what prosecutors described as a 'mountain of evidence' against him. The evidence included a blood-soaked glove found on Simpson's estate and a matching one found at the scene of the murder.

Questions about the lining of the gloves emerged during the 1995 trial, but they did not involve allegations of tampering by defence lawyers.

Two other members of Simpson's defence team, Robert Shapiro and Barry Scheck, did not return calls for comment. Robert Kardashian and F. Lee Bailey, who also represented Simpson, are both deceased.

A civil jury in 1997 found Simpson liable for the deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5million in damages to the murder victims' families. 

Simpson is currently serving up to 33 years in prison for a 2007 armed robbery in which he claimed he was trying to recover his own sports memorabilia.
