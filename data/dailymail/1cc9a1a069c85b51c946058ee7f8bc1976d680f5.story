Airman Daniel Wassom II spent his life putting others first - and his final act of selflessness was to use his body to shield his five-year-old daughter as a tornado demolished their Arkansas home.

As the twister ripped through the town of Vilonia on April 27, the 31-year-old huddled with his wife and two daughters in the hallway of their Aspen Creek home - the hardest hit street in the area. 

But as a large piece of lumber crashed toward his family, Wassom threw himself in front of little Lorelai, taking a fatal blow to the neck.

'Lorelai kept telling the emergency room people, she said, ‘My daddy saved me; the house exploded and my daddy saved me; he’s a hero', Wassom's heartbroken mother Pamela Wassom told Air Force Times.  'And he is. He’s a true hero.'

Family members said Wassom's wife Suzanne, was also a hero, shielding their seven-year-old daughter, Sydney, when the tornado tore through their neighborhood.

Suzanne moved both daughters to safety and helped a little boy who lived across the street.

Suzanne was hospitalized with a concussion, and Lorelai suffered a shoulder injury.

To relatives, Wassom's final act of heroism was not surprising.

'Dan always put his family first,' his grandmother Carol Arnett said, wiping away tears.

Relative Sherry Madden said the family had just returned home from church, where the girls were fighting over who got to sit next to dad: 'He was the best dad'.

Wassom II served in the Arkansas Air National Guard's 189th Airlift Wing for 12 years as a loadmaster.

His mother Pamela Wassom said her son had a college degree and could have trained to be a pilot, but he liked being a loadmaster.

'We're a military family. His father is retired Air Force. His grandfather was in the Navy. He joined right after 9/11,' she said.

'That boy loved his country. He was patriotic. He even volunteered to go to Kuwait a couple years ago, and he said if it hadn't been for the wife and kids, he would even have stayed longer.'

Wassom II and his father shared a passion for old cars, and spent their free time rebuilding a 1934 Ford that was in his garage when the tornado destroyed their home.

The half-mile-wide tornado which claimed Wassom II's life had carved an 80-mile path of destruction through the Little Rock suburbs.

Twisters or powerful straight-line winds were blamed in at least 17 deaths on that dark Sunday - 15 of them in Arkansas.

The tornado outbreak which hit Southern states continued the next day, responsible for at least nine more deaths in Mississippi and Alabama. LA Times reports the current death toll stands at around 34.

Following the April 27 twister, most of the dead in Arkansas were killed in their homes in and around Vilonia, population 3,800.

Firefighters searched for 
anyone trapped amid the piles of splintered wood and belongings strewn 
across yards. Hospitals took in more than 100 patients

The
 tornado that hit Vilonia and nearby Mayflower was probably at least an 
EF3 on the 0-to-5 EF scale, which means winds greater than 136 mph, 
National Weather Service meteorologist Jeff Hood said.

Among
 the ruins was a new $14 million intermediate school that had been set 
to open this fall in Vilonia, a community also terrorized by a twister 
just three years and two days earlier.

But
 the epicenter of the tornado was Aspen Creek Drive, an 
upper-middle-class street of well-kept brick homes and friendly 
neighbors, an American dream kind of place.

A
 few houses down from the Wassom family, neighbors Deanna Noble, 32, and Regina Chavez, 31, 
couldn't find their trucks. Their homes were shredded and their vehicles
 were missing, perhaps blown hundreds of yards away.

Both tried clicking their truck remotes to see if they heard a distant honk. Nothing.

Officials
 said the death toll could have been worse if residents hadn't piled 
into underground storm shelters, safe rooms and fortified community 
shelters after listening to forecasts on TV and radio, getting cellphone
 alerts or calls or texts from loved ones, and hearing sirens blare 
through their neighborhoods.

Maggie
 Caro rushed with her husband and two children to a community shelter at
 a Vilonia school, where they were among the last to get inside the 
fortified gym before the doors were shut.

'They were screaming, 'Run! Run! It's coming!'' Caro recalled.

Kimber
 Standridge and a friend had gathered up seven children they were 
watching and sped through the streets, getting to the shelter just 
minutes before the twister hit.

'When
 they shut the doors, we knew it was on us,' Standridge said. 'Everybody
 hunkered down. There were a lot of people doing prayer circles, holding
 hands and praying.'

On 
Aspen Creek Drive, Noble and Chavez were lucky. Both thought the storm 
would blow over, and both stayed home, taking shelter in closets with 
their husbands and kids.

At 
the worst of it, the unthinkable happened: A neighbor man flew out of 
his own home into the side of the Noble home. Noble tried CPR 'but I 
think he was already dead,' she said.

Chavez and her husband clung to the kids the whole time.

'I
 held onto my youngest, and my husband held onto my oldest,' Chavez 
said. 'The windows were breaking but the kids were good because we 
shielded them.'
