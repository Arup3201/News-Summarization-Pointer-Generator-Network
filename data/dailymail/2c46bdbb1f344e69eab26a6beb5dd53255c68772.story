Fear: Jodie Marsh received up to five letters a week from stalker Joseph Mafwenke

A man who bombarded glamour model Jodie Marsh with letters and photographs of his penis faces prison after being found guilty of stalking.

Joseph Mafwenke, 38, left Miss Marsh fearing for her life after sending hundreds of letters and photographs to her home address in Brentwood, Essex in an attempt to win her affection.

Today a jury at Basildon Crown Court took just 30 minutes to find Mafwenke guilty of a stalking campaign that lasted from November 2012 until September last year.

Mafwenke’s bizarre actions included sending Miss Marsh, 35, doctored images of the pair having sex and strolling hand in hand.

During the trial Miss Marsh said she feared she could be kidnapped, raped or even murdered.

That fear forced the glamour model turned bodybuilder to move out of her home in the hope of escaping Mafwenke's letters.

Mafwenke was eventually arrested after Miss Marsh spotted him staring into a window at her old house when she arrived back in the neighbourhood to visit her family last September.

Although that had not met at that point, Miss Marsh recognised Mafwenke from the photographs she had been sent.

Mafwenke, of Crawley in West Sussex, denied the claims by arguing that an interview Miss Marsh gave to Zoo magazine suggested she wanted a boyfriend.

He told the court: 'I wanted to try my chances with her.'

In court Miss Marsh gave evidence from behind a screen so she would not have to face the defendant.

At one point she broke down in tears when confronted with letters that had been sent to her home address.

The letters initially arrived at a rate of once or twice a week, before increasing in volume to one a day.

'Straight away, I knew it was not normal fan mail, the letters would say things like 'you will be my wife', 'we will be together', 'you will have four children', 'we are meant to be together', Miss Marsh said.

'The way it was said, it was like it was a given that it would happen,' she added.

Miss Marsh said the letters, which included pictures of a naked Mafwenke Photoshopped on top of her, left her 'really scared'.

Miss Marsh said she 'feared for her life' when she received the letters - some of which had been photoshopped to show her having sex with Mafwenke. He also sent her pictures of his penis, jurors heard

The former glamour model, who is now a bodybuilder, said she initially told police not to take any action in case it 'tipped Mafwenke over the edge.' He would send up to five letters a week to Miss Marsh the court heard

'He would send photos of himself, at first he was fully clothed then the photos turned explicit and he sent pictures of himself  naked and photos of his penis and erect penis,' she said.

'That was really upsetting. It was really disgusting - not something that I would want to see.'

'I was left nervous, thinking about what he might do in the future... I was worried that he was mentally unstable,' Miss Marsh added.

She told the court she had initially asked police not to take any action in case it encouraged Mafwenke to escalate his stalking campaign.

Asked by the Crown what she feared could happen, Miss Marsh said: 'I thought it might be rape, murder, kidnap. In my line of work, you don’t think anything is too far-fetched.'

The frequency of the letters then increased to up to five per week with the mail being sent by recorded delivery.

One letter said: 'I love you and the way you are alone... I plan to have four babies with you in married life. Thank you for I make it happen.'

'Our time is now to have our childrens,' another read.

The court heard Mafwenke also made 
'calculations' using his date of birth and Miss Marsh’s to work out 
whether they would be happy together.

When questioned in court Miss Marsh, pictured in training, said she never responded to any of the messages

Talking about the letters, Miss Marsh said: 'I honestly thought he was deluded. I did not think he was mentally stable.'

Miss Marsh told the court she had never responded to the letters and only accepted recorded mail as much of the post she received for work was delivered that way.

Mafwenke, who appeared in the dock wearing a blue and white striped shirt and black trousers alongside his Swahili interpreter, had pleaded not guilty to stalking Miss Marsh at an earlier hearing.

He did not react as the guilty verdict was read out and was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing at Basildon Crown Court in May.
