Fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden is guilty of treason for leaking details of eavesdropping operations by GCHQ and the NSA, Liam Fox declared yesterday.

In a speech in the United States, the former defence secretary said the former spy has endangered the lives of British spies and their families by revealing the techniques used by the intelligence agencies to al Qaeda and foreign enemies.

And he accused the editor of The Guardian of ‘egotism and self-importance’ for continuing to print Snowden’s revelations after being warned that they damaged national security.

Dr Fox ridiculed the claims of Snowden sympathisers that his revelations have been in the public interest because they have cast light on the extent of cyber surveillance by the security services.

He told the American Enterprise Institute think tank: ‘Snowden thinks of himself as a cyber-age guerrilla warrior but in reality, he is a self-publicising narcissist.

‘He did not find or expose anything illegal. Let us not imbue his cowardice with higher motives. Let us not confuse his egotism with public service. Let’s not call his treachery by lesser terms. For once, let’s say what we mean. Let us call treason by its name.’

Dr Fox pointed out that Snowden, who has said he did not want to live in a surveillance society, first took his revelations to ‘the internet-blocking, cyber-attacking and increasingly militaristic’ Chinese state and is ‘currently snuggled up with Putin’s henchmen’ in Moscow.

Dr Fox accused The Guardian of showing ‘contempt’ for the Government’s efforts to limit the damage from the leaks.

British spies destroyed computers at the paper’s offices which contained the Snowden documents on the grounds that terrorist groups and foreign spies could hack into them.

But the paper simply sent a further copy of the data to the New York Times so they could continue working on the story outside the UK.

Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald’s partner David Miranda was caught travelling with a computer hard drive containing 58,000 ‘highly classified UK intelligence documents’.

Dr Fox said: ‘It is clear that the material seized from Miranda contained personal information would allow security staff to be identified, including those deployed overseas. This poses serious dangers to staff including a risk to life, both to intelligence officers and their families.’

Accusing Snowden’s collaborators of ‘pathetically amateur behaviour’, he added: ‘Their toxic mixture of ignorance and arrogance is compounded by basic incompetence in the way in which information has been handled.’

Dr Fox said Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger has shown ‘no sense of understanding, never mind remorse, about what damage might have been done to the security of the country’.

‘This attitude is testament not only to the egotism and self importance of the man but the feeling of impunity that both he and Greenwald seemed, and still seem, to exhibit.’

The former minister, who is tipped to return in David Cameron’s next reshuffle, said there is a ‘legitimate debate’ about ‘whether GCHQ have infringed on the personal privacy of citizens’.

But he said too little attention has been given to ‘the material threats posed by the Snowden disclosures’.

‘We have actually seen chat among specific terrorist groups at home and abroad, discussing how to avoid what the now proceed to be vulnerable communications methods,’ Dr Fox said.

‘No doubt these terrorist groups are extremely grateful to Snowden and Greenwald and their accomplices for these useful tools in their war against our citizens, our Armed Forces and our way of life.’

He added: ‘It is not our security agencies who undermine freedom or democracy. It is the terrorists, the criminals and the enemies of our country who seek to do so. What sort of distorted logic suggests that compromising our security agents, potentially putting their lives in danger, is a service to democracy?’
