They may make sweet pets with their fluffy tails and bunny hops around the garden but rabbits have become an unlikely menace in Denver International Airport - vandalizing cars. 

Wild rabbits are wreaking havoc on holidaymakers' cars by chewing through spark plug cables and other wiring while they're away, according to CBS.

Hundreds of the animals are removed from the site by the USDA Wildlife Service every month but the animals are still breeding like, well, rabbits. 

Not so innocent: Rabbits are causing problems at Denver International Airport chewing through car wiring

Lying in wait: Hundreds of rabbits are removed from the area every month but still manage to cause problems for motorists by chewing through wires

'I see them constantly. At least dozens. They run out of your way and they'll wait under cars where they are warm,' shuttle driver Michelle Anderson told the broadcaster.

Arapahoe Autotek spokesman Wiley Faris told the channel: 'They like to chew on the insulator portion of your ignition cables mainly.'

'If they get into the wiring harness which runs all the wiring for the car it can run from the hundreds into the thousands depending on where the harness is damaged.' 

USAirport Parking is carrying out a number of changes to try and deal with the problem such as stronger fences and building perches for predators such as hawks and eagles.

'It’s hard to get rid of the bunnies but we’re going to try as many natural things as possible,' said a USAirport Parking employee.

Constant presence: A shuttle driver at the airport said she saw the rabbits all the time in the car park of Denver International Airport

Scaring them off: The airport is using predator urine to scare rabbits off the land and restoring fencing to try and prevent the kind of damage reported by motorists in recent months, right

'We’re going to build raptor perches for the hawks and eagles.'

Mechanics in the area of the problem have reported the problem and are now trying to turn the rabbits off by coating car wires with coyote urine.

Drivers are also being told they can buy fox urine from hunting shops  to protect their own cars.

Bunnies aren't the only unusual menace to parked vehicles.

In December special covers were given out at the Everglades National Park to help motorists protect their vehicles from vultures.

Vultures love to pick at cars pulling off rubber sunroof seals and hood plastic. It is not known why the vultures cause such damage as they just discard the material once they've removed it.

Often Insurance firms won't pay out for animal damage making the problem an even bigger headache for car-owners.
