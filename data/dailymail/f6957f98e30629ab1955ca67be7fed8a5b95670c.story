A British ISIS fighter who has threatened to return home has urged Muslims in the UK to avenge the murder of a Saudi Arabian woman in Essex.

A man using the nom de guerre Abu Rashash Britani has previously claimed that he and other British insurgents have been ordered to return to Britain once they have finished fighting in Iraq and Syria by the fanatical ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Following the murder of 31-year-old PHD student Nahid Almanea in Colchester, Essex on Tuesday, Abu Rashash Britani said: 'I call upon any brother to take up a knife and kill as they did #colchester'.

A previous tweet by Abu Rashash suggests Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, head of ISIS, will target the UK with homegrown fighters

Anti-terror investigators in London are already examining claims in a tweet by Abu Rashash that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, head of ISIS, is targeting the UK with homegrown fighters.

Baghdadi, who has a £6million bounty on his head, is considered the world's most dangerous terrorist leader.

Now, following the murder of a Saudi woman of Ms Almanea in Colchester - which police believed may have been inspired by her conservative Muslim clothing - Abu Rashash Britani called for revenge attacks.

'These kuffar getting out of hand, dare they touch a #Muslimah. I call upon any brother to take up a knife and kill as they did #colchester,' he posted on Twitter.

Drawing comparisons to the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby outside his barracks in Greenwich last year, the ISIS fighter added: '#colchester attack is cowardly act. At least when our noble brothers, killers of #leerigby did so they killed a soldier not a civilian.'

Twitter has since suspended the account used by Abu Rashash Britani.

Nahid Almanea was found bleeding to death at 10.40am on Tuesday on a footpath in Colchester.

She was wearing a dark blue robe called an Abaya, as well as a multi-coloured hijab scarf, leading police to believe she may have been targeted for religious reasons.

A 52-year-old man from Colchester was arrested in connection with the incident. Officers are thought to 
have requested extra time to question him.

Probe: Police are appealing for anyone with information. It is the second brutal murder in Colchester since March

Abu Rashash Britani has previously 
declared: 'I my brother intend to go back to #UK under the order of our 
Ameer Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi #foreignpolicy.'

It was the first time it had been suggested that Baghdadi is preparing to 
send his battle-hardened and highly trained ISIS fighters back to the 
UK.

The revelation came as 
David Cameron warned that Britain cannot afford to ignore the chaos in 
Iraq and Syria because of the risk that British jihadis will bring their
 murderous tactics back to the UK.

He
 told MPs: 'I disagree with those people who think this is nothing to do
 with us and if they want to have some sort of extreme Islamist regime 
in the middle of Iraq, that won't affect us. It will.

'The
 people in that regime – as well as trying to take territory – are also 
planning to attack us here at home in the United Kingdom. So the right 
answer is to be long-term, hard-headed, patient and intelligent with the
 interventions that we make.'

Mr Cameron, who described the 
estimated 400 British fighters in the region as 'the most serious threat
 to Britain's security that there is today', later chaired a meeting of 
Britain's National Security Council.

In
 a statement, No 10 said British military intervention was 'not on the 
table'. Sources said the security services are focusing on the threat 
posed by returning foreign fighters.

In other developments yesterday:

* Downing Street said 14 Britons have had their passports seized to stop them going to Syria to fight over the past year.

* A senior Tory MP called for Tony Blair to be impeached for misleading the Commons in the run-up to the 2003 invasion. Father of the House Sir Peter Tapsell said ancient Parliamentary powers should be revived to hold Mr Blair 'to account'.

* MI5 and Scotland Yard are  monitoring the use of social media by British jihadists in Syria.

Baghdadi, known as 'The Ghost' because
 he is rarely seen, is said to control between 3,000 and 5,000 fighters,
 many of them thought to be foreign.

He is called the 'new Osama Bin Laden' but even Al Qaeda have  distanced itself from his bloodstained methods and goals.

The identity of Abu Rashash Britani is not known, but he is thought to be linked to a group of eight Britons from London and Portsmouth operating as part of a unit called the British Kataa'ib, meaning British Brigades.

Britons in Syria are encouraging others in the UK to follow them by offering a rough travel guide for would-be jihadists.

In a series of postings, they advise people to travel light and bring a smartphone for internet access, but to leave religious books at home to avoid suspicion when travelling through airports.

They highlight the need for visas for those heading to Turkey, the main 'gateway' border to Syria, and even detail the type of plug adaptors new recruits will need to charge their electronic devices.

One Briton, who goes by the alias Abu Abdullah al-Britani, told would-be militants on the Ask.fm website to delete 'jihad pics' from their phones in case they are searched. He added: 'Be careful is my advice. I would delete them kinda things'.
