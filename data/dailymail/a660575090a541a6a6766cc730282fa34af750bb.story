Owners of Australia's first Hello Kitty Cafe are in a froth after getting a stern warning from company headquarters in Japan when bosses there noticed they were serving coffees with the bow on the wrong side of the cat-like character.

To celebrate the opening of the store in Adelaide, fans were invited to come and sample sweet treats and enjoy a cup of coffee - topped with a motif of Kitty made out of chocolate powder sprinkled through a stencil.

One fan shared an image of her cuppa on the cafe's Facebook page and the picture was spotted by executives at Sanrio, who own the Hello Kitty licence, in Tokyo.

They noticed that because the stencil was used the wrong way, the bow was on Kitty's right ear - and quickly pointed out it should be on the left.  

'We got into a lot of trouble from Sanrio,' store owner Jade told Daily Mail Australia.

'Her bow is meant to be on the left hand side but we're not sure why or how that photograph turned out that way.'

In August, Sanrio revealed the beloved character is not actually a cat. In fact, she's a real human named Kitty White who lives outside of London, has a twin sister and owns a cat.

While her little bow is famously attached to her left ear, her twin sister, Mimmy White wears a yellow bow on her right ear.

Offering plenty of selfie opportunities with the beloved cat, the first Sanrio-licensed Hello Kitty Café in Australia opened its doors in Adelaide this week.

More than 1000 foodies attended the official opening on Sunday and anyone who celebrated their birthday in November was treated to a free ‘mini Hello Kitty mousse cake’.

From macaroons and mousses, to birthday cakes and crème brûlées, the menu serves up cat-face treats for casual coffee dates, birthdays as well as high tea gatherings.

‘Our main focus will be on desserts and of course, everything from the food to the décor will feature the character,’ staff member Damaris Oaurovics told Daily Mail Australia.

‘We’ve got our own chefs to freshly make and bake all the desserts from scratch daily and also our own baristas to serve up hot or cold beverages.

‘We’re also looking at bringing out a savoury cafe-style menu in the future – so light meals like burgers, chips, salads, sandwiches and many more.’

Despite the Sanrio character famous for its 'pink theme', the coffee chain store is not decked out in pink but still stay true to its character with giant kitty figurines.

‘Our café is not pink – A lot of people assume that our café would be pink from the ceiling down to the floor but our colour code at the moment is brown, yellow, grey and white,' Ms Oaurovics said.

‘When the owner from Sanrio brought the café here, he decided to keep it simple and change the colours to make it look like a café-style place for everyone to enjoy.'

Ms Oaurovics added: ‘The reason why Adelaide was picked to opened its first Hello Kitty-themed café was because the business partners happened to live here.’
