Tom Watson has been placed at the centre of Labour’s vote-rigging row in Falkirk after one of the candidates for the seat directly accused him of trying to fix the selection.

Gregor Poynton, a Blairite communications expert, said Ed Miliband’s former campaigns chief had used his power in the party to try  to install his union-backed office assistant as the candidate.

Mr Poynton also claimed that Mr Watson had been involved in ‘all the shenanigans’, including trying to pack the Falkirk party with members of the Unite union to win selection for his assistant, Karie Murphy.

He also alleged that the party leadership ‘knew what was going on’.

It is the first time Mr Watson, who stepped down from his frontbench role in the wake of the row, has been publicly accused by another party figure of trying to influence the selection process.

Mr Watson did not respond to messages but has previously denied any wrongdoing or involvement in the alleged ‘fix’ of the selection process in Falkirk.

The explosive claims come just days before the contest to succeed Eric Joyce, who quit the party after a Commons bar brawl, is reopened in the Scottish seat.

Labour suspended the selection in May after The Mail on Sunday revealed it was investigating allegations of vote-rigging by Unite and had referred the matter to the police.

Ms Murphy and the local party chairman, Stephen Deans, were also suspended - triggering a knock-on threat of industrial action by Unite at the nearby Grangemouth petrochemical plant, where Mr Deans is a union convener.

Mr Miliband dropped the investigation in September after key witnesses withdrew their testimony. Mr Poynton, the UK political director of communications firm Blue State Digital, made his remarks at a party fundraising dinner last week.

He described an atmosphere of ‘serious intimidation’ during the selection process - claiming he and fellow candidates had ‘all been taken out in one way or another’.

He told how Mr Watson had tried  to help Ms Murphy by ‘packing’ the local party with Unite members, ‘getting them put on the membership list... they had a spreadsheet of names and a cheque, and he phoned up party office and said you need to accept this’. He described the reaction of Labour HQ as ‘it’s a bit dodgy... not sure about this’, adding about Mr Watson: ‘He was involved in it all behind the scenes... all the shenanigans, pushing things through’.

But Mr Poynton said that when the party leadership uncovered the allegations it tried to broker a deal with Unite for Ms Murphy to quietly stand down: ‘The party came to a deal... we’re not going to investigate this stuff that’s gone on, we know what’s all gone on, but you have to pull out of the selection,’ adding: ‘Their preference was, we know it’s all happened but it’s better for everyone if you just pull out.’

Shortly before the process was suspended, Mr Poynton was eliminated from contention when an all-female shortlist was imposed.

Mr Poynton, who is married to West Dunbartonshire Labour MP Gemma Doyle, said he still had not ruled out being selected when the process is reopened. The allegations follow the leak of emails last week which appeared to show Unite officials were involved in a bid to undermine Labour’s inquiry.

Unite dismissed the suggestion and said neither the law nor party rules had been broken in the selection process.

Last night, a senior party source said: ‘We have acted swiftly and decisively throughout the process, and the candidate at the centre of the issue has now withdrawn.’

Mr Poynton did not comment.
