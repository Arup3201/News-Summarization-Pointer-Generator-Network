The parents of missing student Lauren Spierer are outraged that their daughter's reputation has been tarnished by her boyfriend's parents who claim that the young woman was a drug user.

Today marks the two-year anniversary of when the Indiana University student was last seen in 2011 after a night of partying with friends in Bloomington.

Lauren's parents Robert and Charlene Spierer said on Monday that they were appalled by claims by the parents of Jesse Wolff that their daughter used drugs. 

Desperate search: Lauren Spierer, 20, has been missing for two years with very few leads into what happened to the 20-year-old Indiana student

The Spierers told the Indy Star on Monday: 'We are appalled that the Wolffs have defamed our daughter knowing that Lauren will never have the opportunity to respond.'

Their outrage came after Nadine and Alan Wolff, whose son Jesse was dating the young woman at the time she disappeared, called the Spierers 'liars' last week, adding: 'This poor little girl is not with us today because of her drug abuse.'

The couple said that they were defending their son against the constant public scrutiny and calls from the Spierer family for Jesse, and three other young men who were the last to see Lauren, to come forward with information.

Focus: Jesse Wolff, Lauren Spierer's boyfriend at the time of her disappearance, has passed a private polygraph test

The Wolffs' explained that the reason their son had not taken a police polygraph is because they did not trust law enforcement in the town.

They told the paper that their son passed a private polygraph test.

One of the young men who was last to see Lauren, Jay Rosenbaum, told investigators that she may have told him she had snorted a prescription drug on June 3, 2011.

He also claimed that Miss Spierer 
and a friend David Rohn had taken cocaine - but no evidence has been 
found of this allegation.

Police
 have given no further information on whether investigators have made 
any progress into what happened to the 20-year-old two years ago. 

Her parents say they still believe someone will eventually reveal what happened to her.

Robert and Charlene Spierer say it would be devastating to never find their daughter even though they assume she is dead.

Seeking answers: This surveillance photo is the last known image of Lauren. Several of the people to see her last have hired lawyers and stopped fully cooperating

The Spierers have maintained since 
soon after Lauren vanished in the early hours of June 3, 2011, in 
downtown Bloomington that several of the people who were with her that 
night haven't fully cooperated with police.

'There's
 a sense that someday, some week things will change for us. That someone
 will have the strength, the crisis of conscience to come forward,' 
Robert Spierer told The Herald-Times of Bloomington.

The 20-year-old apparel merchandising major from Greenburgh, New York, could have graduated with her college class last month.

Indiana University President Michael 
McRobbie asked those attending the commencement ceremony to keep Miss 
Spierer and her family in their thoughts.

Bloomington
 police officials won't comment on the search other than to say the 
department has received more than 3,000 tips, with some 160 of those 
coming in this year.

'There's only so many ways you can say we continue to investigate,' police Captain Joe Qualters told The Indianapolis Star.

'We will not talk about people. We will not talk about evidence. We will not talk about the investigatory plan.'

Robert
 and Charlene Spierer spent weeks in Bloomington after their daughter 
disappeared, and hundreds of volunteers joined searches around the city 
and parts of the surrounding wooded countryside that is dotted with old 
limestone quarries and lakes.

Although
 many of Lauren Spierer's friends and classmates have left Bloomington, 
there were rejuvenated efforts in April to rebuild signs and hang new 
posters to keep up awareness about her disappearance.

Bloomington
 firefighters rebuilt 20 large, wooden-framed signs to replace the 
weathered billboards that were first erected two years ago. Members of a
 Lauren Spierer Facebook group invited the public to distribute and hang
 new posters and fliers.

'We do have local support,' Robert Spierer said. 'Her presence is in Bloomington.'

The three young men who were last
 seen with Lauren said earlier this month that her parents are harassing
 them for information about their daughter's whereabouts. 

One of the young men 
who was seen carrying her out of a restaurant towards his house is saying
 that the Spierers are harassing him by repeatedly calling him demanding
 information that he claims he does not have.

'We’ve done nothing wrong. If we’d 
done something wrong, we would have been arrested already. All they’re 
doing is hurting my career,' said one of those men Corey Rossman.

'It’s inappropriate the way they’re harassing people that are also victims in this case,' he told The Indianapolis Star.

Rossman told the paper that he has had 
to field phone calls from reporters, the Spierer's lawyers, and the 
Spierers themselves, though the parents deny that they ever called the 
young men themselves.

'Rob and I have never spoken to Corey Rossman,' Lauren's mother Charlene said to the paper.

'The
 private investigators have never spoken to Corey. So I don’t know how 
it is we’re harassing him other than asking him to talk to the 
Bloomington police department. All of them.'

Rossman is involved in the case is 
because he accompanied Lauren to a bar, and then back to her apartment 
at a building called Smallwood Plaza. While there, he was punched in the
 face by another student.

His
 lawyer has previously said that Rossman does not remember anything 
after the punch, but the building's surveillance footage shows Rossman 
helping Spierer out of the building in the direction of his own 
apartment.

Plea for information: Lauren Spierer's mother Charlene asks the public to help find out what happened to her daughter, two years after she went missing in Bloomington, Indiana

Rossman, his roommate Mike Beth, and their neighbor Jay Rosenbaum are the final three people to see her alive.

The
 article in the Indianapolis Star paints Rossman as defensive, as he 
said the following when a reporter called him at work: 'What do you 
think, I’m doing drugs now? No, I’m at work. Don’t ever call again. If 
you contact me again, you’re going to hear from my lawyer. Either way, 
you’re going to hear from my lawyer.'

No arrests have been made in relation to the young woman's disappearance.

The
 search for Lauren has taken one frustrating turn after another. When 
the investigation began two years ago, five of her male friends, who police believed 
could have offered insight into the final moments before her 
disappearance hired criminal defense lawyers and stopped fully 
cooperating with police.

Speaking on Katie Couric’s daytime talk show in December, Lauren’s parents said that their daughter’s friends are impeding the search for her. They hypothesized that the friends have made a pact of silence.

‘Despite their claims of doing whatever they could do, the fact of the matter is they refuse to meet with us…they refuse to take a police polygraph, which we feel is important for a number of reasons,’ Mr Spierer said.
