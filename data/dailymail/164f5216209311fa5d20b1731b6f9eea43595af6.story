Cheat: Former England boss Steve McClaren has allegedly been having an affair with a woman who also had a fling with Sven Goran Eriksson

Former England boss Steve McClaren has allegedly been having an affair with a woman who also had a fling with Sven Goran Eriksson.

Married McClaren, 51, is said to have met Saima Ansari at the same hotel in Manchester where she first met Eriksson - who was also the head coach of England.

McClaren - a father of three - has been regularly meeting up with Miss Ansari after flying back into Britain from Holland, where he is manager of FC Twente.

According to The Sun, Miss Ansari said McClaren introduced himself to her while she had lunch with a friend at the Lowry Hotel in June.

Incredibly, she was sat at exactly the same table where she first met Eriksson five years earlier.

Before leaving the hotel, McClaren - who had a three-month affair with a secretary while boss at Middlesbrough in 2006 - exchanged numbers with Miss Ansari.

Later the same day, they arranged to meet for a coffee. Miss Ansari noticed McClaren was wearing a wedding ring and confronted him about it but he laughed and replied 'it's complicated'.

The pair then text each other over the course of the following week.

'He would just say that he couldn't stop thinking about my sexy eyes,' said Miss Ansari. 'Sometimes the texts would start at 6am and sometimes we'd still be texting at midnight.'

Eventually, they met again in Manchester where McClaren seduced the divorced mum of two at the Radisson Blu Edwardian Hotel.

Speaking to The Sun, she said they met at the hotel and had some drinks. 'Before I knew it we had started kissing,' she said. 'One thing led to another and I stayed the night.'

The news will come as a devastating blow to McClaren's wife Kathryn following his previous affair.

After that was exposed, he said he wanted to draw a line under it and concentrate on his family.

History: Miss Ansari went on a series of dates with Eriksson in 2007 - shortly after he left as England coach to become the new manager of Manchester City

Miss Ansari went on a series of dates with Eriksson in 2007 -shortly after he left as England coach to become the new manager of Manchester City.

Over the course of a year, they slept together on a number of occasions.

McClaren was Eriksson's assistant manager when he was England boss and took over from him when the Swede lost his job.

It is thought that McClaren is unaware that Miss Ansari also had a relationship with Eriksson.

Miss Ansari says she last met with McClaren last Monday lunchtime and told him to sort out his marriage otherwise their relationship was over.
