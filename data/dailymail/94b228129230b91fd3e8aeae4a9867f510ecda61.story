A father determined to find his missing daughter has reunited nine families with their lost children as he travels China hunting for his own.

Feng Jianlin's daughter Feng Yun was kidnapped at the age of nine  by human traffickers in 2008.

Three months after his daughter's disappearance, Jianlin closed his tyre shop in Taiyuan, capital of Shanxi province, and decorated his small truck with pictures of the girl and his phone number. 

He has since travelled thousands of miles around China in a bid to find her.

Determined: Father Feng Jianlin pictured driving his van decorated with the faces of missing children - including his own daughter Yun who disappeared in 2008

He said: 'We'll never give up looking for her.

'My wife was overwhelmed and has been sick ever since. My other two daughters miss their sister a lot. We all need her.'

Feng Yun had just left home for afternoon classes in March 2008 when she vanished. Her parents appealed for help from the police and relatives in other cities, but their initial searches proved fruitless.

But in the four years since his daughter went 
missing, Feng has never given up hope and has travelled thousands of 
miles around the country searching for her.

As time went by, he started to travel with the parents of other missing children and added their pictures and details to the side of his van.

Incredibly, Feng Jianlin has reunited nine parents with their lost children, but tragically is still to find his own daughter. 

Search: Feng Jianlin closed his tyre shop in Taiyuan, Shanxi province, and decorated his truck with pictures of his missing daughter Yun before travelling around the country in search of her

Dedicated: Feng Jianlin has refused to give up on his daughter Yun and spent the last four years looking for her

'We don't know how far we can go, but it's the most effective way to find our kids,' said Li Yongfei, who recently traveled with Jianlin to look for his own missing daughter.

'I have to work, so most of the time Feng is the one looking for my child. I really appreciate his help.'

Feng now visits city after city handing out fliers in public squares and has also set up a website that collects information about lost youngsters.

He added: 'If I reach as many people as possible, the chances that I will find someone who knows something about my daughter will greatly increase.'

Feng's family now survives on a basic living allowance from the government.

Since Yun disappeared, they have burned through their entire savings and borrowed about 100,000 yuan - around £10,000 - from relatives.

Feng said: 'The pain of failing to find our daughter tortures us every day. But we just can't afford it anymore; we have two other daughters and my aging parents to care for.'

There are no official statistics on the number of kidnapped children in China each year, but unofficial numbers show that each year at least 30,000 to 60,000 children in China are kidnapped for human trafficking.

Campaign: Feng and other families with missing children now travel from city to city handing out leaflets and appealing for information

Unknown: There are no official figures for the number of children who go missing every year - but up to 60,000 are kidnapped for human trafficking
