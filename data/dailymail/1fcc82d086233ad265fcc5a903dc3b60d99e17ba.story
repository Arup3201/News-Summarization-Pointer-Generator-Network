Zlatan Ibrahimovic has revealed what started the bitter feud between Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal and his Southampton counterpart Ronald Koeman.

The Swedish striker was caught up in the power struggle between pair while he was at Ajax - where Van Gaal was technical director with Koeman manager of the Eredivisie club.

According to the PSG superstar, the bust up between the two Dutchmen was sparked by Van Gaal's insistence that Ibrahimovic should only be used in Champions League matches as Ajax were coasting in the league.

Speaking the Sun on Sunday, Ibrahimovic said: 'Koeman went mad. He was furious at Van Gaal.

'He felt that statement meant his hands were tied and limited his chances to fight for me.'

Ibrahimovic, who refers to Van Gaal as 'a pompous a***' in his autobiography I Am Zlatan, also revealed how Van Gaal 'stuck his oar in' at a meeting with Koeman to discuss his performances.

The 33-year-old was accused of deliberately trying to injure former Tottenham playmaker Rafael van der Vaart during an international between Sweden and Holland - and claimed the United manager told him: 'I am the dictator here'.

The warring managers will face each other for the first time in the Premier League when Manchester United travel to St Mary's  on Monday evening.
