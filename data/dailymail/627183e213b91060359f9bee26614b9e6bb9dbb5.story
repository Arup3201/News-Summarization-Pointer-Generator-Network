A 14-year-old boy was stabbed to death and three other teenagers suffered knife wounds after a Bronx house party descended into violence.

Justin Fallu was stabbed in the chest following an argument at the apartment in the early hours of yesterday morning. Two 18-year-olds also suffered stab wounds to the chest and a 17-year-old was cut on the left side of his torso. 

All four victims were taken to Jacobi Medical Center, but Justin did not survive the journey.

Neighbors comfort one another on hearing the news of the death of 14-year-old Justin Fallu stabbed to death at a Bronx house party that got out of control

Paramedics found one of the blood-covered victims a block away, the New York Daily News reported. Above his stab wound was a tattoo that read, 'Never Fear Death'.

Residents of the building where the incident took place said the teenagers had been partying in an apartment and smoking marijuana in the stairwells all day. 

Shortly before 3am the party spilled out into the lobby and appeared to have spiraled out of control.

'They were screaming at each other in the lobby,' said one woman, who did not want to be identified.

'Someone said, 'Yeah? Well go ahead and do it.' And the next thing you know, they came out and did it,' she said.

Another tenant said that he called the police after he felt the party had gotten out of control.

'I called the cops at 2am, and they just said all they could do was ask to turn the music down,' he told New York Daily News.

'As soon as the cops left, they turned the music back up, and 20 minutes later, this [is] what happened,' he said, pointing at the bloody clothing in the middle of the street.

Justin's neighbors expressed shock at the news of his death.

'I just saw him last night,' one said. 'He said, 'I'm going to a party.' He was a good kid, he didn't deserve to go out like that.'

A neighbor and family friend, Nick West, 45, told the New York Times that Justin was 'a young man with morals and principles who, unfortunately, turned out to be a statistic'.

Asked how Justin's parents were coping, Mr West said: 'They are devastated.'

Mr West added that Justin used to run errands for his wife, who was an amputee. He described the neighborhood as a rough one where it was tough to stay out of trouble.

But Justin, he said, 'was smart enough to see the bigger picture'.

'Unfortunately,' he added, 'the friends that he had were into things they shouldn't have been into.'

The three surviving victims are listed as in stable condition. There have been no arrests.
