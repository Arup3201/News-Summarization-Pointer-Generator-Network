A congressman was tricked into retweeting photos of Nazis and war criminals.

Darrell Issa, a Californian Republican, started retweeting pictures of US military veterans in a publicity stunt on Twitter that has courted significant traffic for his account in the past.

But it seems he and his media team weren't paying astute attention to the images being sent to them.

Hijacked: Congressman Darrell Issa of California unwittingly retweeted this picture of senior Nazi Heinrich Himmler among photos of American war veterans after pranksters hijacked his Twitter publicity stunt

Didn't get the joke: Issa (left) was unwise to the trolls who tweeted, among others, this image (right) of William Calley, the US officer who was found guilty of murdering 22 Vietnamese citizens during the war in 1968 

Among the naval officers, soldiers and corporals, Issa's followers were also bombarded with murderers and convicts sent to the unwitting politician by pranksters.

One user, @Butt_C_Planet, posted a picture of his 'late grandfather' - that was in fact a picture of Nazi Heinrich Himmler.

Another used the AmericasVets hash tag to tweet a picture of JFK's assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, with the words: 'my uncle Lee in 1956'.

Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh also appeared in the feed.

One user posted a photo of the controversial 3rd Battalion 5th Marines who posed with a Nazi SS flag.

And finally an account with the name Uncle Dad tweeted a picture of William Calley, the US officer who murdered 22 Vietnamese, adding: 'love you dad'.

Issa's team rushed to undo the retweets after receiving a wave of criticism.

A spokesman told the Daily Dot that Issa does not always control the account himself.
