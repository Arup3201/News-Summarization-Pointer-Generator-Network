Police are hunting for Britain's meanest romantic after he took his date for a Valentine's night curry only to flee before the bill came.

The cheapskate was caught on CCTV leaving a South Wales restaurant without stumping up the £62 he and his partner had racked up on food and drink.

After getting through copious amounts of curry, rice, and naan bread, all washed down with glasses of white wine, he persuaded his girlfriend to join him outside for an after-dinner cigarette - but then grabbed her by the hand and ran for it.

Scam: He convinced his 'large build' girlfriend to pop out of the restaurant for a cigarette before running for it

The manager of the Bengal Lounge in Kenfig Hill, near Bridgend, admitted today the incident had left him convinced that 'romance must be dead'.

The couple enjoyed two courses before running out before paying their bill at the Bengal Lounge restaurant.

They tucked into poppadoms and chutney, onion bhajis and king scallops.

They then shared Murgh Makhani - tender pieces of chicken cooked in a rich, butter and almond sauce. They also had Harash Komola which is grilled duck tossed in an iron wok with sweet and sour orange sauce.

They also had sides of pilaw rice, Peshwari naan and a portion of chips.

This was all washed down with two bottles of Pinot Grigio wine.

'Given that this crime happened on the most romantic day of the year I 
thought the woman's partner would have paid for the meal instead of 
doing a runner,' Abdul Kahim said.

'I was absolutely devastated when they walked out without paying for all the food they'd had.'

The absconding couple guzzled two bottles of Pinot Grigio wine, two three-course Valentine's Day special set meals, as well as poppadoms and mango chutney.

Mr Kahim added: 'Valentine's Day is an important day for our restaurant as it brings us in a lot of revenue, so it's very worrying for us when a couple walk out.

'I saw the couple in the restaurant myself and they didn't look like the type to walk out or cause any kind of trouble.

'But it's a good thing that we captured their faces of CCTV, I'm hoping they can be caught now.'
