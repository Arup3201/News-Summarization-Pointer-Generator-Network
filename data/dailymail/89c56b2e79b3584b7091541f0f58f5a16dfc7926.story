Arsenal once again lead the way in what is developing into a fascinating title race.

But will Arsene Wenger's men end their eight-year trophy drought this term? And who better to ask than Gunners' legend Martin Keown...

Sportsmail's columnist returns to tackle your questions with another big weekend on the cards at the top of the table.

The A-team: Jack Wilshere scored to help Arsenal reclaim top spot in the Premier League with their win over Aston Villa

Title challengers Chelsea take on 
champions Manchester United. Will Jose Mourinho pile on further misery 
for David Moyes or will the Red Devils prove they're not dead and buried
 yet?

The transfer 
window is beginning to hot up too. United boss Moyes held talks with 
Juventus over Paul Pogba and Arturo Vidal, while a host of moves have 
been completed elsewhere in the Premier League. But with just over a 
fortnight until the window slams shut, who should your side sign?

And
 Cristiano Ronaldo was crowned the greatest player in the world as he 
beat Lionel Messi to the coveted award. Was it the right result? And if 
there was a Premier League Ballon d'Or, who would make the top 1-2-3?

Ask all these questions and more as Martin Keown takes over at 12.30pm on Thursday for a LIVE Q&A session on the site.
