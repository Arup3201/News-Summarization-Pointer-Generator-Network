Internet service appear to have been restored in the Syrian capital following nearly three days of a nationwide communications blackout.

The Syrian government apparently sought to flex
its muscles on Thursday by shutting down internet and phone services across the 
country.

But journalists in the capital, Damascus, have reported that internet connections are now up and running with dispatches coming in from the central cities of Homs and Hama, the northern city of Aleppo and areas along the coast.

While the 
government attributed the loss of the internet and cellphone service to 
'terrorists', experts said the progressive shutdown of connectivity 
could only have been orchestrated by a central authority.

Meanwhile, Syrian troops continued to clash with rebels today as government forces pushed a major offensive on villages and towns near the capital's international airport, activists said.

The fighting over the past few weeks in Damascus is the worst to hit the capital since July, when rebels captured several neighborhoods before a quick government counteroffensive swept out the opposition fighters.

It comes after the U.N reported syrian refugees are being shot at as 
they flee to neighbouring Jordan.

U.N spokeswoman Melissa Fleming told a news briefing in Geneva: 'We have received very disturbing reports from Syrian refugees in Jordan who say they were targeted as they were fleeing.

'UNHCR calls on all sides to ensure that at least civilians have access to safe passage outside the country.'

It was not clear who was taking aim at civilians as they ran for their lives under cover of darkness.

'These reports are generally kept highly confidential, people are terrified. They don't like having their stories told,' Fleming said.

Some families sedate their children during the journey to the border to keep them 'calm and quiet', Fleming said.

More
than 465,000 Syrians have registered as refugees in neighbouring 
countries and North Africa. Thousands more have not signed up for 
refugee status and assistance, the UNHCR says.

Nearly 138,000 are registered in Jordan, where the largest camp at Za'atri north of Amman houses more than 32,000.

The UN refugee agency also said 250,000 
people were living in temporary shelters in the flashpoint city of Homs,
without adequate food, clothing or medicine as winter added to the 
misery of civil war.

A UNHCR team managed to reach Homs this week, where they found 250,000 displaced people living in 'squalid' conditions.

Fleming added: 'They saw thousands of displaced people living in unheated communal shelters.

'They also observed that half of the city's hospitals are not functional and there were severe shortages of basic supplies ranging from medicine to blankets, winter clothes and even children's shoes.'

One communal building sheltered 70 families, or 400 people, while at another '2,300 people are crammed into an abandoned public building, the largest such shelter in Homs'.

'These are displaced people, some may 
be from Homs and left their embattled neighbourhoods as their homes were
destroyed, others come from other parts of the country and have been 
displaced many times,' Fleming said.

Some
city hospitals have been converted into communal shelters and 60 
percent of Homs doctors have left, along with other medical personnel, 
according to the agency.

A UNHCR convoy of nine trucks delivered winter assistance to Homs during the two-day visit ending on Thursday night, including quilts, sleeping mats, winter blankets, mattresses and sanitary napkins.

'We are scheduled to deliver more aid in coming days. We have a better idea of needs in a city going through tremendous shelling since the beginning of the conflict and is really in a desperate situation,' Fleming said.

Brutal: Unarmed men appear to plead for their lives in footage allegedly filmed in Ras al-Ain, Syria, by a rebel fighter

Execution: The armed gunman filming the footage appears to shoot the prisoners in the head

The report came just hours after footage was posted on the Internet on Thursday night that appeared to show a Syrian rebel shooting 10 unarmed prisoners.

The video shows 10 men wearing t-shirts and camouflage trousers lying face down next to a building and a lookout tower. Even before the shooting, two of the men are not moving and one has blood coming from his torso.

'I swear to God that we are peaceful,' begs one of the men to the camera, which is being held by the gunman. Cowering, the man gets up to plead with rebels. As he approaches a rebel off-screen, a shot is heard and he returns holding his bloodied arm.

The cameraman then points the camera along the barrel of his Kalashnikov assault rifle as he shoots the men.

'God is great. Jabhat al-Nusra,' he says, referring to the secretive al-Nusra Front, an Islamist rebel unit linked to al Qaeda that has claimed responsibility for several suicide bomb attacks around the country.

The gunman gets on the back of a pickup truck and the camera pans to show the man who had been shot in the arm still moving. More shots are fired and his body spasms.

The authenticity of the footage has not been verified. Comments accompanying the video said it was filmed in Ras al-Ain, a town on the border with Turkey where pitched battles have raged in recent weeks.

Activists say some 40,000 people have been killed
in the violence since the rebellion against Assad began 20 months ago.
