Tim Vine has cleaned up with a one-liner about a vacuum to win a funniest joke contest at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for the second time.

His gag, ‘I decided to sell my Hoover… well, it was just collecting dust’, received nearly a fifth of the votes in the competition run by television channel Dave.

Punslinger:
 Comedian Tim Vine's gag about vacuum cleaners has won an award for the 
Edinburgh Fringe's funniest joke, the second time he has taken the award

Vine, 47, clearly saw the funny side of becoming the first to win the contest twice.

‘I’m a little bit surprised but very delighted,’ he said.

‘This is the second time I’ve won this award but I guess nobody loves a repeat more than Dave.’

Second place in the competition, which has been running for seven years, went to Masai Graham with: ‘I’ve written a joke about a fat badger, but I couldn’t fit it into my set.’ Mark Watson came third with: ‘Always leave them wanting more, my uncle used to say to me. Which is why he lost his job in disaster relief.’

In contrast to last year, when men filled all the places, three women performers made the top ten this time. Highest placed was Bec Hill, who came fourth with: ‘I was given some Sudoku toilet paper. It didn’t work. You could only fill it in with number 1s and number 2s.’

Ria Lina came fifth with: ‘I wanted to do a show about feminism. But my husband wouldn’t let me.’ And Felicity Ward was tenth with: ‘This show is about perception and perspective. But it depends how you look at it.’

The organisers said the appearance of three female stand-ups in the top ten reflected a reported 62 per cent rise in the number of women performing at this year’s Fringe compared with last year.

A panel of ten judges scoured the Edinburgh Fringe’s venues for a week before each nominating their three favourite jokes.

The shortlist was then put to the public vote, with 2,000 people choosing the ten they found funniest.

Vine, the 
younger brother of Radio 2 host Jeremy Vine, is perhaps best known to 
most people for his appearances in the BBC sitcom Not Going Out.

He
 first won the Fringe award in 2010, with the joke: ‘I’ve just been on a
 once-in-a-lifetime holiday. I’ll tell you what, never again.’

But
 Vine also had one of his jokes voted among the most unpopular this 
year: ‘I’d like to start with the chimney jokes – I’ve got a stack of 
them. The first one is on the house.’
