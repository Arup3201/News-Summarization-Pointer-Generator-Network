Daniel Sturridge proved that he hasn't been letting himself go during over four months on the sidelines after sharing a picture of himself and team-mate Philippe Coutinho comparing physiques.

The Liverpool striker is back at Anfield after a course of rehabilitation in the US to recover from a series of  thigh and calf problems.

The 25-year-old obviously felt in good nick on his return to training and, on this evidence, winning a 'six-pack off' with the Brazilian playmaker - the results of which were posted on Instagram with the caption: 'Back at training and Philippe Coutinho said let's have a 6 pack off. This guy is my brother. #assistgenius #hermano'

Manager Brendan Rodgers hopes the England international will be back in action before the end of the month after working with medical staff from the Boston Red Sox and personal trainer Scott Schrimscher in a bid to get his season back on track.

He said: 'He [Sturridge] will be back in the country over the next 24 hours. The work he has done has been fantastic. 

'His rehabilitation has been great and we hope that he will be available at some point in January.

Liverpool have fallen out of the title race and the Champions League during Sturridge's absence

'He is a top class player with wonderful idea of the game. His pace is frightening and he is at a great age. If he can sustain that and stay fit, we hope he will lead the charge for many years.'

The Reds could certainly do with the return of Sturridge's goals after slumping out of the Premier League title race and Champions League during his absence - while Mario Balotelli is yet to score a single league goal.
