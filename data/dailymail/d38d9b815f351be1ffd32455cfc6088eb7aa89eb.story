A toddler has died after swallowing a tiny battery which caused internal bleeding and lacerations to his esophagus.

Julian Wilson, who was about to celebrate his second birthday, ingested a small battery at his family home and passed away on October 18.

His family rushed him to hospital in Las Vegas after the little boy began vomiting blood but doctors were at a loss as to what was wrong with the child.

Julian Wilson was almost two years old when he died from ingesting a small battery at his home in Las Vegas

Julian’s grandmother Elena Derbyshire told the Las Vegas Review-Journal: 'They didn’t know what it was in the X-ray.

'They didn’t figure out it was a battery until they did the autopsy.'

The Clark County coroner ruled the death an accident and reported on Monday that Julian died from internal bleeding with lacerations in his esophagus, gastric irritation and a collapsed lung.

Las Vegas police and the Clark County Department of Family Services continue to investigate.

Julian's grandmother said that the family have nothing to hide and the incident was a tragedy.

The family had previously been investigated by family services in 2012 but the claims were not substantiated.

The little boy's death is still being investigated by Las Vegas police and the Department of Family Services after he swallowed a battery on October 18

Button batteries are found in everyday household appliances including remote controls, key fobs, musical greetings cards and watches.

Each year in the U.S., around 2,800 kids need hospital treatment after swallowing the tiny batteries.

The number of serious injuries or deaths as a result of button batteries has increased ninefold in the last decade, according to safekids.org.

Parents of young children are advised to lock away loose batteries or duct tape over compartments in battery-operated devices.

If you suspect a child has swallowed a battery, take them to hospital immediately.
