A woman car passenger hit by a concrete block hurled from a bridge had four titanium plates inserted in her face as surgeons reconstructed her shattered cheekbones.

Grandmother Carol Manley, 57, was inches from being killed as the bucket-shaped 20kg block was thrown through the windscreen of her husband's Nissan on the A12 in Essex.

Today her husband Steve, 56, who was driving, said if the concrete had been six inches further over he would be planning his wife's funeral.

Inches from death: Carol Manley, 57, in her hospital bed after undergoing reconstructive surgery following the attack on the A12

Horror: Carol Manley has suffered cuts and bruises, a fractured eye socket, a broken nose and her ribs are broken. She also has internal injuries

Mr Manley, a lorry driver, escaped with just a scratch to his face when the two-foot-high block came through the window.

He revealed his wife of 37 years, who has four grown up children and 11 grandchildren, is epileptic and has had three fits in two days following the attack at West Hanningfield Bridge, Galleywood.

She is covered in cuts and bruises, has a fractured eye socket, a broken nose and her ribs are broken. She also has internal injuries.

Just 40 minutes before the attack, on the evening of December 1, and only three miles away on the same stretch of road, thugs had lobbed another missile at a Vauxhall Astra.

Mother-of-two Lisa Horne, 26, and her mother Stella, 48, both escaped serious injury as the   block hit their car after it was thrown from Fryerning Bridge near Ingatestone.

Police are treating both attacks as attempted murder.

Today Mr Manley told of his fury as he spoke out a week after the attack.

Happier times: Carol with her husband Steve on holiday before the accident

Missile: This is the two foot 20kg concrete block inside the Manley's Nissan car. Firefighters had to cut the roof off the vehicle to get Mrs Manley out

Shattered: This picture shows the full extent of the damage to the windscreen of the Nissan. The roof was cut off as Mrs Manley was rescued and rushed to hospital

Huge weapon: The block was two foot tall and weighed around 20kg. Police think it may have been a bollard outside a property

He said: 'I could not tell you just how angry I am or what I would do to the culprits should we ever cross paths.'

The couple were returning to their home in Harold Hill, Essex, after visiting friends near Chelmsford last Thursday.

He said any bystanders at the scene with the culprits probably didn't have the 'backbone' to contact police.

'Even if someone who was maybe with the culprits but didn't play a major part, who might see this story and realise how much damage their friends' actions have done, maybe they can call the police and come up with some sort of deal, a lighter sentence or no charges,' he said.

'But then I imagine the people involved haven't got the backbone to call the police and do the right thing. These are the kinds of people who stood in the dark, threw a block off the bridge and then ran away.

'It's almost like a pyromaniac who starts a fire but then stays to watch the flames.

'I don't know what makes these people tick.'

He said his wife is still drifting in and out of consciousness. 'She is recovering but it is not so much the physical scars as they mental ones.

'Carol is epileptic and she has now had three fits in the space of two days yet she had not had a fit for nearly a year.

'The stress of everything that has happened has made her much worse.'

Emotional: Mrs Manley's daughter Michelle wipes away a tear at today's press conference, while her husband Steve describes the injuries his wife sustained

Accident scene: This is the West Hanningfield Road bridge that the concrete block was thrown from into the Manley's car

Mr Manley said that he could not at first understand what was happening when the concrete hit the car.

He said: 'We heard a thud and I thought that I had hit a fox. When I went to look at Carol to say "what the hell was that" I realised there was a hole in the roof and windscreen and this great lump of concrete was on her lap.

'I just did not give a thought as to where it had come from - I just wanted to check that Carol was okay.

'I did not get to speak to her properly until we got to the hospital - that is when we realised that had the lump of concrete been six inches further over, I would be planning my wife’s funeral right now.'

Probe: Police cordon off West Hanningfield Bridge over the A12 at Galleywood, Essex, from where the missile was thrown

He pulled over onto the hard shoulder before his wife was cut from the car by firefighters and taken to Chelmsford’s Broomfield Hospital.

Police have been comparing the two attacks with 30 similar incidents on the A12 over the past three years.

The block which hit the Manleys is thought to have been a bollard from a nearby house, police have said.

So far there have not been any arrests but detectives revealed earlier this week that they are planning on speaking to three teenagers who were arrested previously but released without charge.

Officers have been carrying out door-to-door inquiries in recent days and doing stop-checks on motorists in the areas close to where the two bridge attacks took place. 

Block victims: Lisa Horne, 26, and her mother Stella, 48, escaped uninjured when another block was thrown into their Vauxhall Astra 40 minutes before the Manley's car was struck
