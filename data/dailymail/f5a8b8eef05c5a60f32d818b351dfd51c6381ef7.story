UKIP supporters are cousins of the Tory party ‘and we want them back’, a former Conservative minister has declared.

Ex-chief whip Andrew Mitchell also hit out at the European Union as a ‘supranational organisation’ unable to respond to British needs.

But he sought to reach out to people who have backed UKIP, in stark contrast to previous attacks launched by senior Tories dismissing them as fruitcakes, racists or clowns.

Appeal: Former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell reached out to voters who have switched to UKIP

Ahead of the Conservative conference in Manchester, party strategists are increasingly anxious about how to win back voters who have switched to the UK Independence Party.

In the latest YouGov poll Labour has a nine-point lead over the Tories, but 11 per cent say they will back UKIP.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage predicts his party will win next year’s European Parliament elections before winning their first seats in the Commons in 2010.

Mr Mitchell, who is tipped for a return to government in the forthcoming reshuffle, hinted at a new Tory attempt to reach out disaffected voters who have defected to UKIP.

‘They are mostly our cousins and we want them back,’ he told the New Statesman.

The remark strikes a more conciliatory tone than the outright attacks launched by senior Conservatives in the past.

Most famously, in 2006 David Cameron 
declared: ‘UKIP is sort of a bunch of ... fruit cakes and loonies and 
closet racists mostly.’

Ahead
 of local elections this year, Tory minister Ken Clarke suggested UKIP 
were ‘a collection of clowns or indignant, angry people’.

Attempts
 by Mr Farage to present a more professional image for his party have 
been hampered by the outlandish behaviour of some of his members.

MEP
 Godfrey Bloom this week he announced he would not represent UKIP in the
 European Parliament after repeatedly embarrassing the leadership.

A row has erupted over attempts by the main political parties to exclude UKIP from TV leaders' debates.

Ed Miliband yesterday challenged David Cameron to sign up to TV debates at the next election.

The
 Labour leader told the Prime Minister to 'stop ducking and diving' and 
agree to repeat the live broadcasts first seen during the 2010 campaign.

But Mr
 Miliband ruled out the idea of UKIP leader Nigel Farage being given a 
place insisting it should be the same format as last time, with Lib 
Dems, Labour and Tories represented.

In response, Mr Farage said: 'Ed Miliband was all for UKIP being involved in televised debates until he woke up to the fact that we take votes from all over the political spectrum.'

Things reached a head when he called described UKIP members at an event promoting women in politics ‘sluts’ before hitting a TV report over the head.

Mr Farage hit the roof as the farcical antics overshadowed UKIPs annual conference in central London.

Mr Cameron has sought to tackle the threat posed by UKIP by promising an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU by 2017.

A future Tory government would seek negotiate a ‘fresh settlement’ with Brussels before holding the vote.

Asked which powers he would like to see clawed back from the EU, Mr Mitchell said: ‘There are areas where national governments are better at responding to the wishes of those they serve than a supranational organisation can be.

‘We should discuss the repatriation of these powers with our colleagues in other national parliaments and try to reach a common understanding with other national politicians.’

Mr Mitchell was forced to resign last year after he was accused of launching a foul-mouthed rant at police officers guarding Downing Street as he asked to cycle through the main gates.

Pressure intensified a police log of the incident emerged, which claimed he called officers ‘plebs’ and swore at them repeatedly for making him walk through a side gate.

He insisted he did not use the words attributed to him, and later said he was the victim of a deliberate attempt to ‘toxify’ the Tories and ruin his career.

This week eight people including five police officers arrested as part of the heavily criticised investigation were re-bailed until late October.

They include five constables from the Diplomatic Protection Group, which is responsible for guarding politicians and foreign dignitaries, one of whom, a 46-year-old woman, was present when the row happened.

Two of the officers - the woman and a man who is also 46 - were arrested over alleged leaks to the media about what happened.

The members of police staff are two women aged 46 and 49 who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, and a 23-year-old man who was held in December.
