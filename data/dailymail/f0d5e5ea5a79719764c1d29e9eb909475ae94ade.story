She was taken to Atrium Medical Center where an autopsy is currently underway.

'She got halfway through the house and just collapsed,' her grandmother Betty Benge said to ABC 5 News. 'She was almost through it.'

Christian was at the attraction with about 100 friends and family members. 

Land of Illusion features 'four enormous haunted houses and one terrifying haunted trail.

The park boasts 'live spooks, lunatics and chainsaw-wielding madmen.'

Mom Jean Benge said that that her daughter was born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which prevents the lungs from developing normally but she tried to save her daughter and performed CPR on her

The owner of the attraction Brett Oakley said no 'injury accident' occurred on the premises. 

Christian's mother performed CPR on her after collapsing. 

Jean said her 'mother instinct' kicked in as she performed CPR on her daughter.

'I did CPR until the paramedics arrived. And I trust God. He has the ultimate plan,' she said.

'She's better off than we are … because of her faith in Christ I know she's home.'

Christian was a sophomore at New Miami High School and an active member of Eaton Road Full Gospel Church, where she sang in the choir.

Her grandparents described her as a kind, gentle and lovable person.

Her family say her love of God and strong faith are what they will remember most about her. 

'You couldn't find a better kid than she was,' her grandfather Ernest Benge said.

Christian had a birth defect and was born with a very low chance of living, 

She was living with one lung and sometimes had breathing problems.

Despite health problems, Ernest said Christian's death was sudden and unexpected.

Medical officials said part of Christian's heart was enlarged four times its size.

'They said she was like a time bomb,' her grandmother Betty said.
