Burnley footballer Marvin Sordell is the latest athlete to get his kit off for Sport magazine.

The 23-year-old striker, who netted his first goal of the season against Tottenham last week, took time out of  Burnley's Premier League relegation fight to pose for pictures in the nude.

The former Bolton player bared all for new photography project Sport Uncovered, a series of pictures that celebrate the athleticism of sportsmen and women.

While Sordell clearly spends a lot of time in the gym, the striker insists it is being out on the pitch that he enjoys most.

'I prefer being out on the pitch to doing the gym work, to be honest,' he said.

'Everyone who plays football would tell you that because you start playing football when you're a young child - you play on the streets and you just enjoy kicking the ball around as often as possible. 

'That's all I used to do in school and out of school. I'm lucky enough to be able to do it as a job now.'

Sordell is the second athlete whose picture will be in the magazine as part of the series after heptathlete Louise Hazel appeared in last week's edition.
