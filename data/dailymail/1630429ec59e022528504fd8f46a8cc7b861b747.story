Two mothers, who had grown frustrated with stereotypical clothing collections designed for little girls, have launched their own fashion line which features the cars, dinosaurs and pirates that were once exclusive to boys' clothing.

Rebecca Melsky and Eva St. Clair, both from Washington D.C., took to Kickstarter on February 3 to raise $35,000 for production of their gender-bending Princess Awesome collection. 

Since then, their crowdfunding campaign has already made more than $90,000, making it the highest-funded children's clothing project in Kickstarter history.

'Girls shouldn't have to decide between dresses and dinosaurs or ruffles and robots,' they explained on their fundraising page. 'We're a different kind of girly.'

The Princess Awesome line includes colorful dresses featuring airplanes, pirates, spaceships, trains and classic art, as well as math and science symbols. 

Ms Melsky, a third-grade teacher with two children, told Yahoo that when her daughter was two years old, she insisted on wearing frilly dresses, but she would also wear boys' pajamas featuring spaceships and trucks to bed.

'She loved them,' Ms Melsky recalled. 'And I thought, "I wish she had a dress with spaceships" or, really, any of the patterns we could get on her "boy" jammies.'

She teamed up with her friend Ms St. Clair, who is a mom of four, and they debuted their innovative designs in April 2013. They started by selling their unique dresses at the Christmas bazaar held by Ms St. Clair's church and later made their collection available online.

Their original play dresses featuring dinosaurs and Pi symbols sold out within a few weeks of production.

'The demand is there, but the supply is not,' Ms Melsky said in their fundraising video.

Ms Melsky and Ms St. Clair's website is currently closed as they prepare to begin factory production and add new styles to their growing collection. 

Many online commenters took to Princess Awesome's Kickstarter page to praise the project and thank the moms for their designs.

Big business: The money earned from Ms Melsky and Ms St. Clair's Kickstarter page will go towards factory production of their designs

'As a scientist and a mom, I couldn't be more excited about this movement,' one woman wrote. 'I hope your success and the budding popularity of your dresses is a signal to mainstream clothing/toy makers that parents want more for their daughters than what they currently offer.'

She added: 'If I could have given more money, I would have! Thank you for being a voice for us!'

Another mom added: 'I don't know who is more excited about your company, me or my daughter.'

Ms Melsky explained that she and Ms St. Clair believe that a lot of girls like things that are 'traditionally girly' as well as things that aren't. 

'As a parent, I want to honor my daughter’s love of feminine fashion choices and also foster her interest in math or science or construction all in one outfit,' she told Yahoo Parents.
