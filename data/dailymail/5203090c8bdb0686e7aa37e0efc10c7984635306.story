If you live in Australia and love  dumplings then your life just got three times better. 

Tim Ho Wan, the world's cheapest Michelin-starred restaurant from Hong Kong is set to open three eateries in Sydney next year.

The bite-sized  dumplings have attracted large crowds obsessed with dim sum, prompting founder and chef Mak Kwai Pui from Four Seasons Hong Kong to set up restaurants throughout Singapore.

Now, Australians will get to experience the  sort-out dumplings at Tim Ho Wan, as the restaurant prepares to open their first restaurant outside Asia in Sydney's northshore, with more Australian outlets to come.

'The first will open in Chatswood, above the railway station, in late February. Then at Westfield in Burwood in June, with the George Street restaurant, located opposite Event Cinema, in October,' Vince Howe, who is heading up Tim Ho Wan's Australian operations, told Good Food. 

Like in Asia, Mr Howe is expecting long queues at his international box-sized restaurants.

Australia's appreciation for Asian food helped in the decision when trying to chose between Tim Ho Wan's global fan base for the next location for their new restaurant

'Most of our restaurants you can queue for up to an hour and a half, in Sydney we'll be offering a reserve option,' he said.

Mr Howe said Australian taste-buds are well tuned to Asian food, so it was only natural to bring the Michelin-starred restaurant to Australia, over Europe or the US.

'Plus, the Aussies were the first foreigners to flood to Tim Ho Wan,' he said. 

Unlike yum cha, Tim Ho Wan promises to provide the freshest dim sum in their restaurants.

'Everything we make is fresh and made to order. Nothing is made overnight or frozen. It's also good to have a menu, so you know what you're paying for. With [the cart system] there is that surprise at the end of the meal when you find out what it cost.'

In 2009, the original 24-seat dim sum eatery in Mongkok, Hong Kong's Kowloon, was branded the cheapest Michelin-starred restaurant in the world.
