These days, police officers are likely to respond to emergencies in a modest Vauxhall Astra or Ford Focus.

But back in the Sixties, one cool constabulary got its hands on  a fashionable Triumph convertible to catch criminals.

Now, a TR4 acquired by Southend-on-Sea County Borough police in 1962 is expected to sell for a staggering £40,000 at auction.

The nimble sports car, with a top speed of around 110mph, was ideal for pursuing bank robbers who tried to get away in their powerful but heavy Jaguar cars.

The Triumph was supplied to the force with a number of modifications including a Pye radio, Winkworth bell, air horns and windscreen-mounted, hand-operated lamp.

Unlike today's gaudy panda cars, the only police markings were a discreet sign on the front grille and a stop sign on the boot.

But one thing it didn't have was seatbelts - with one officer once describing the time he 'hung on to the underside of the seat whilst in fast pursuit'.

The car, which has been fully restored to showroom condition, is owned by a Somerset enthusiast who has enlisted Historics Auctions to offer it for sale.

Historics, which describe the Triumph as 'exceptional and rare', has given the convertible an estimate of between £35,000 and £40,000.

The car is so well known that toy maker Vanguard made a limited edition toy model - complete with '4100HJ' registration plate - which can now be bought on eBay for £15.

John Williams, from Historics, said: 'It is in beautiful condition and is a very interesting car which will get you into many classic events.

Eventually retired from service in the 1970s, the car was last sold to its current owner in 1991 who decided to restore it to original police specification

'The TR4 is one of those cars which really needs to be seen. It is a genuine period police car.

'Standard police cars were normally saloons but the odd force would buy something different. This is probably the only one left.'

The TR4, a 'fast pursuit car', would be used for two shifts every day, clocking up around 1,000 miles each week.

One winter, amid considerable snow and ice, a call came in from Southend Hospital to deliver an urgent drug from London.

There were no helicopters available in those days, so the TR4 was pressed into service and the journey was completed in double quick time despite the conditions.

When the weather was good, officers would take advantage of its convertible roof and drive around with the top down while wearing their helmets with chin straps in place.

Eventually retired from service in the 1970s, the car was last sold to its current owner in 1991 who decided to restore it to original police specification.

It is being sold with a large history file which includes a copy of Advanced Driving Explained by Inspector W H Jobson, priced at one shilling and sixpence, with a picture of 4100 HJ on the cover.

The Triumph is one of around 100 classic cars which will be sold at the Historics sale, which takes place at Brooklands, in Weybridge, Surrey, on June 1.
