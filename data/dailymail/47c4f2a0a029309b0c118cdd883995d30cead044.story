Damaging: Oliver Robbins, the deputy national security adviser, said articles based on confidential files leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden, pictured, exposed the capabilities of the intelligence and security agencies

Newspaper stories based on stolen top secret documents have caused ‘real and serious damage’ to Britain’s national security, a senior official warned yesterday.

Oliver Robbins, the deputy national security adviser, said articles based on confidential files leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden exposed the capabilities of the intelligence and security agencies.

As a result, they risked helping terrorists evade detection and endangering the lives of British service personnel.

His stark warning came at the start of a judicial review into the use of counter-terrorism powers to detain and question David Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, by the police and Security Service earlier this year.

Mr Miranda was stopped at Heathrow Airport on August 18 and found to be carrying 58,000 documents, part of the cache stolen by Mr Snowden from the US National Security Agency.

He was held for nine hours.

He later revealed he had no idea what he was carrying for Mr Greenwald, prompting descriptions of him as a ‘document mule’.

Matthew Ryder QC, for Mr Miranda, told the High Court yesterday that the use of the Terrorism Act 2000 to seize the materials was a ‘disproportionate interference with his right to freedom of expression’.

The Home Office argues that MI5 had a duty to stop him and seize the documents to protect national security.

In a written submission handed to the court, Mr Robbins said the Government was ‘extremely concerned’ about the damaging reporting attributed to the highly classified material stolen by Edward Snowden.’

He said it risked making it easier for ‘foreign states to identify our intelligence officers and take steps against them’

The hearing, before Lord Justice Laws, Mr Justice Ouseley and Mr Justice Openshaw, concludes tomorrow.
