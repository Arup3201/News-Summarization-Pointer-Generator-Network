The BBC licence fee could be cut after the Culture Secretary warned that it was a big expense for families and that ‘nothing should be ruled out’ when it is reviewed next year.

In the clearest signal yet that the Conservatives are preparing to overhaul the Corporation’s funding and governance if they remain in government after the general election, Sajid Javid said the annual £145.50 payment would be scrutinised.

Mr Javid also said the BBC Charter, which sets out its scope and remit and will be renewed for another decade in 2016, must take into account big technological changes in how people watch programmes.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said the £145.50 licence fee was a 'large amount' of money for ordinary families

The former Economic Secretary to the 
Treasury was speaking to BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show yesterday in his first 
big interview since being appointed in April.

The ex-banker was a surprise replacement for Maria Miller, who stood down amid a scandal about her expenses.

Asked about the future of the licence fee, which raises £3.6billion a year for the BBC, he said: ‘That’s a very important issue.

'One
 thing we did when we came into government was to freeze the fee at 
£145.50. I  still think that’s a large amount for many families up and 
down the country. This needs to be looked at when we have the Charter 
review process.’

MPs 
are considering scrapping the licence fee and replacing it with a 
subscription system or a household levy similar to council tax. John 
Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons Culture Select Committee, warned 
last month that the fee was ‘designed for a different age’ and ‘will not
 survive’.

Mr Javid 
said he would look at the alternatives after the election and when a new
 BBC chairman is appointed to replace Lord Patten, who quit last month 
after heart surgery.

He 
said: ‘Since the last Charter review technology has changed. Think of 
the number of people who consume  programmes through platforms like 
Netflix or iTunes or even the BBC’s own iPlayer.

Lord Tony Hall, the BBC's Director General, could face a significantly smaller budget if the Government slashes to licence fee in 2016

‘That’s
 been a big technological change. When we have the review it needs to 
take all this into account... nothing should be ruled out and nothing 
should be ruled in.’

The MP for 
Bromsgrove, who has taken criticism from some figures in the arts who 
say he lacks knowledge of the subject, also said he had always enjoyed the 
theatre and the last play he saw was ‘War Horse’ with his daughter.

His comments come after John Whittingdale, the chairman of the influential Culture Select Committee warned last month that the licence was ‘designed for a different age’ and ‘will not survive’.

Mr Whittingdale told the Mail it would either be dropped at the next renewal of the BBC Charter in 2016, or if no alternative is agreed on, it may be kept for the start of the next ten-year Charter period.

Alternatives being considered by his cross-party committee of MPs, which will make recommendations to Mr Javid, are a ‘TV tax’ for every home, perhaps added to council tax or another utility bill; or a subscription service whereby people who want to watch television have to purchase a pay-TV box.

He said last month: ‘It’s outmoded and was designed for a different age. We have a situation where if you watch live TV online you have to pay the licence fee and if you watch it on a five minute delay you don’t. Even if someone watches live TV online and doesn’t pay its very difficult to detect. It’s also regressive and there’s no help for people who can’t pay.

Changes: On-demand service iPlayer does not require users to have a licence unless shows are watched live

‘Support for it is weakening by the day. The original settlement was that everybody gets something from the BBC so everybody pays it. But the explosion of choice in terms of channel and different ways to access it.’

Labour’s culture spokesperson Harriet Harman has also conceded alternatives need to be looked at. There is understood to be no appetite among MPs for introducing adverts to fund the BBC.

In March MPs backed plans to decriminalise non-payment of the TV licence fee – which accounts for one in ten magistrates court cases, from next year. The BBC fears it could lose £200million a year from the change and could be forced to close channels.

There is a growing clamour from MPs and the public to reform the BBC Trust, but Mr Javid said this ‘important decision’ would also be left until after a new chairman has been appointed.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘He simply said
 that the next negotiation will need to consider changing technology, 
which is what every negotiation since the first has done. 

‘The
 licence fee, at 40p per day, remains much more popular than alternative
 methods of funding the BBC and we are working hard to offer the public 
the best value possible for every penny.’
