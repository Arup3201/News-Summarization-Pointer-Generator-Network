The expenses cheat congressman who decorated his office in the style of Downton Abbey has compared himself to Abraham Lincoln as he finally quit office.

Aaron Schock predicted in his farewell address on Thursday that like another Republican representative from Illinois who once held his seat, he would ultimately persevere. 

Schock said he would leave Capitol Hill with 'sadness and humility', but he knows that 'God has a plan for' everyone. 

He offered no apology to other members of Congress, his constituents or taxpayers for a litany of lavish claims.

Schock's downfall came after a Washington Post reporter discovered that he had redecorated his office in the style of acclaimed British television show Downton Abbey to the tune of $40,000, paid for by the taxpayer.

Another trip saw him take a group of 20, including several interns to New York for a Katy Perry concert at a cost of $10,000.

It was one of a series of celebrity events he attended and which were posted on his Instagram, featuring Arianna Grande and even Pope Francis. 

It was billed by Schock as a 'very legitimate trip' as it coincided with a visit to the city by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He then posted a picture of himself with the Indian leader.

The final blow was when Politico discovered that Schock had wrongly reported and been reimbursed for mileage on his personal vehicle - bought at taxpayers' expense.

But he acknowledged nothing of that in his speech, instead using it to say he was going through 'defeats' like Lincoln - the president nicknamed 'Honest Abe' throughout his political career for his utter personal integrity.

'I also know that every person faces adversity in life. Abraham Lincoln held this seat in Congress in one term. But few faced as many defeats in his personal, business and public life as he did,' Schock said.

'His continual perseverance in the face of these trials, never giving up, is something all of us Americans should be inspired by, especially when going through a valley in life.'

A rising star in the Republican Party, and one of the youngest members of Congress from either political party, the flashy congressman, first attempted to weather the storm - hiring top-level communications strategists to help him beat back the charges - before announcing he would quit hours after his mileage claims came to light.

In exiting Congress swiftly Schock avoided an ethics investigation from his peers.  

He could still be charged with criminal wrongdoing, however, and is now under investigation by federal law authorities for possible campaign finance violations, several news reports have indicated. 

Technically a Member of Congress until the end of the month, Schock said goodbye to his constituents and colleagues today as representatives prepared to head home for a two and a half week long recess built around the Easter holiday.

The nearest he came to an apology was to speak of 'humility'.

'I was never more excited than the day I walked into this chamber six years ago. I leave here with sadness and humility,' Schock said on the House floor.

'For those whom I've let down, I will work tirelessly to make it up to you.'

He could still be charged with criminal wrongdoing, however, and is now under investigation by federal law authorities for possible campaign finance violations, several news reports have indicated. 

Lincoln was first nicknamed Honest Abe when he was a store clerk in Springfield, Illinois, and the epithet stuck with him throughout his life. He used it as the 1859 presidential campaign slogan.

Schock was correct that they had represented the same seat but Lincoln's sole term was not because he had to resign or because the voters kicked him out - he in fact was standing by his pledge that he would serve only one term. 

A Whig at the time he served in the federal legislature, Lincoln went on to become the 16th President of the United States, a position he held while the country was immersed in its first, and only, civil war. 

His Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves in Confederate, southern states fighting against the Union.

Sounding more optimistic than humiliated, Schock said today that he believes 'through life's struggles, we learn from our mistakes and we learn more about ourselves.'

'And I know that this is not the end of a story, but rather the beginning of a new chapter,' he added. 

'Thank you for the honor to serve,' he said in at the conclusion of his remarks, nothing that he looks forward to keeping in touch with both his friends in Congress and in his district.

He then left the House chamber - and an empty coffee cup, violating the legislature's rules - to applause.

According to the Hill, three of his Republican colleagues - Jason Smith of Missouri, Kristi Noem of South Dakota and Mark Sanford of South Carolina - were waiting in the wings for him as he gave his speech.

Sanford memorably rose from the ashes to take back his old congressional seat after leaving his state's governor's office in disgrace several years before. 

Following his first stint in Congress Sanford was elected and reelected as governor of South Carolina before he was caught cheating on his wife with an Argentinian mistress whom he later proposed to but never married.

Still beloved in South Carolina by some of his former constituents Sanford reclaimed his House seat via a special election in 2013 and achieved reelection last fall.

He ironically shares the same birthday with Schock. 

After Shock announced his resignation, his father said: 'Two years from now he’ll be successful, if he’s not in jail.'
