Fears of a global nuclear war breaking out were today stoked after Israel suggested Iran has been developing missiles with an extraordinary range of 6,200 miles - enough to reach the U.S.

An international political storm is now in full force as the U.S. desperately tries to talk Israel out of an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities amidst fears a strike could now come within just two months.

Israel's deputy prime minister Moshe Ya'alon said the missiles were being tested at a site near Tehran that was destroyed three months ago and they were ‘aimed at America, not at us’.

Mr Ya'alon said Iran is creating ‘a 
nightmare for the free world’. Iran, which is accused of preparing to 
build a nuclear bomb, says it will retaliate over Western-backed oil 
sanctions and any attack threat.

The U.S. doesn’t believe Iran is 
producing such a long-range missile, but Defense Secretary Leon Panetta 
is still reportedly fearful of a growing chance Israel would attack Iran
 as early as April.

‘Threatening Iran and attacking Iran 
will harm America,’ Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned 
in a defiant speech on Friday.

‘Sanctions will not have any impact on
 ‘our determination to continue our nuclear course’ and it will impose 
any threats ‘at the right time’, he added.

‘I have no fear of saying that we will
 back and help any nation or group that wants to confront and fight 
against the Zionist regime (Israel).’

America is leaning heavily on Israel, 
even though it has largely concluded that outside argument will have 
little effect on Israeli decision-making.

Warning: Israel's deputy prime minister Moshe Ya'alon suggested Iran is developing missiles with an extraordinary range of 6,200 miles - enough to reach the U.S.

'In light of the realisation of the divine promise by almighty God, the Zionists and the Great Satan (America) will soon be defeated,' Mr Khamenei added, reported World Net Daily.

The stand-off poses a major political 
challenge for President Obama, who has been regularly mocked by most of 
the GOP presidential candidates for failing to take a tougher stance 
against Iran.

Israel fears that Iran is fast 
approaching a point at which a limited military strike no longer would 
be enough to head off an Iranian bomb.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and defense minister Ehud Barak have been increasingly vocal in expressing concern that Israel might be running out of time.

'The world has no doubt that Iran’s nuclear program is steadily nearing readiness and is about to enter an immunity zone,' Mr Barak said, reported Bloomberg.

'If the sanctions don’t achieve their goal of halting Iran’s nuclear weapons program, there will arise the need of weighing an operation.'

Mr Ya'alon told a security conference Iran was successfully building 
long-distance ballistic missiles. He said: 'Such a non-conventional regime should not have such non-conventional capabilities.'

He
 told the annual Herzliya national security conference in Israel that an
 Iranian military compound that mysteriously exploded on November 12 
last year was developing long-range missiles.

Secretary Panetta believes Israel 
could strike before Iran enters a 'zone of immunity' to start building a
 nuclear bomb, reported the Washington Post.

The Israelis fear the Iranians will 
soon have ‘enough enriched uranium in deep underground facilities to 
make a weapon’, the newspaper reported.

Mr Khamenei said any U.S. strike 
against Iran would backfire and the ‘painful and crippling’ Western 
sanctions would only increase its resilience.

‘Americans say all options are on the 
table - even the option of military strike,’ he said. ‘Any military strike
 is ten times more harmful for America.

Mr Khamenei said strike threats show 
the U.S. can only use ‘force and bloodshed to achieve its goals’ and 
cannot speak against ‘Iran's logic'.

‘Such sanctions will benefit us,’ he 
said. ‘We would not achieve military progress if sanctions were not 
imposed on Iran's military sector.’

Mr Khamenei described Israel as a 'cancerous tumour that should be cut and will be cut’ and talked about Iran assisting foreign militant groups.

Escalating row: The U.S. has sent the USS Abraham Lincoln to the Strait of Hormuz along with British warships after Iran threatened to close the strait

Israel, widely believed to possess the
 Middle East's only nuclear arsenal, views Iran's uranium enrichment 
projects as a major threat.

The delay of a joint U.S.-Israeli 
military exercise due in spring may signal the prospect of an Israeli 
attack soon, reported the Washington Post.

'Israel has indicated they are considering this, and we have indicated our concerns'

Leon Panetta, U.S. Defense Secretary

Iran has said repeatedly it could 
close the vital Strait of Hormuz Gulf oil export route if sanctions 
succeed in preventing it exporting crude.

Israel estimates it could make four 
atomic bombs by further enriching uranium already stockpiled, and its 
first bomb within a year of starting.

China stepped up its opposition to a 
Western push for tighter sanctions, warning tensions over the nuclear 
programme are hurting energy markets.

It comes a day after German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel urged Beijing to use its influence to persuade Iran to 
give up its nuclear programme.

China, the biggest buyer of Iranian 
oil, has long opposed unilateral sanctions that target Iran's energy 
sector and has tried to reduce tensions.

Escalating tensions between Iran and the West have pushed up Brent crude prices by about 9 per cent since mid-December.

'Sanctions will benefit us. We would not achieve military progress if sanctions were not imposed on Iran's military sector'

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader

President Barack Obama maintains the 
U.S. is reserving the right to attack Iran if it one day feels it must, 
but an Israeli strike on Iran is more likely.

'Israel has indicated they are 
considering this, and we have indicated our concerns,' Secretary Panetta
 said on Thursday in Brussels.

In Washington, the Senate Banking Committee easily approved yet more penalties on Tehran on Thursday in a sweeping measure.

It’s not yet law but would, amongst other plans, expand penalties for energy and uranium mining joint ventures with Tehran.

Congress approved - and President 
Obama signed - a bill last month to target financial institutions that 
do business with Iran's Central Bank.
