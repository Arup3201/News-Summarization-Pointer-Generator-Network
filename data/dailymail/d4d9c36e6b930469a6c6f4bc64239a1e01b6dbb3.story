Manchester United legend Paul Scholes seemed to get caught jokingly muttering an obscenity in the direction of former team-mate Robbie Savage on Wednesday night.

Scholes was previewing Liverpool's Premier League clash against Tottenham on BT Sport's Fletch & Sav show when his former United youth team-mate Savage made a joke about Scholes' height.

The 40-year-old looked as though he found Savage's joke genuinely funny, laughing along with the host, before seemingly muttering 'k***head' under his breath.

Scholes then smiles as he glances to people in the studio, perhaps not realising that the whole incident had been caught by the BT Sport cameras.

Savage has since responded to clip, writing on Instagram that he will have to 'make Scholes pay' on the golf course.

He wrote: 'Scholesy called me much worse as a youngster... Top Guy! Will have to make him pay on the golf course now #Scholes #Sav #YouthTeam #Mufc #beckham #neville #greatbarnet' 

Scholes, who has been part of BT Sport's live football coverage, usually alongside former Liverpool midfielder Steve McManaman and host Jake Humphrey, seems to have increased his popularity with the cheeky comment.

Match of the Day presenter and former England international tweeted: 'Some of Paul Scholes' punditry is top drawer @RobbieSavage8'

Earlier in the show, Scholes slammed Louis van Gaal for reacting to Sam Allardyce's 'long-ball United' comments  - labelling the Dutchman's outburst 'bizarre'.

The former England midfielder believes Van Gaal should have ignored the West Ham manager's comments, which were made following the 1-1 draw at Upton Park on Sunday.

The 63-year-old turned up for his press conference ahead of United's game against Burnley on Wednesday with a four-page dossier, which he insisted dispelled the claims made by Allardyce.

Scholes said: 'Why would you react to a West Ham manager? It’s different if it’s a rival manager like Chelsea or Manchester City's, but at the end of the day you're the Manchester United manager.

'I found it all bizarre to be honest with you, as I felt Allardyce's comments were light-hearted in the first place.'
