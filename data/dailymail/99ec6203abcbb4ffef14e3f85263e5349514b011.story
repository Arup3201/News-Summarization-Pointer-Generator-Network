Timothy Giles, 46, sent this photo of a random pilot - who is not connected to the 
case - to various lovers to convince them he worked for Qantas airlines

An unemployed toilet cleaner used a random photo of a pilot he found online to convince women that he worked for Qantas airlines - so he could con the victims out of money.

Timothy Giles, 46, from Blunsdon, near Swindon, swindled would-be lovers by spinning a series of elaborate tales about his apparent high-flying jobs.

He downloaded a picture from the internet of a pilot 
which he believed looked like him and sent it to his
 various lady friends, pretending it was him at work.

The fraudster even sent one victim a picture of the Indian Ocean which he had also downloaded, claiming it was the view he was looking at.

Once he had tricked the women with his fake life story, the real-life Catch Me If You Can fraudster - described in court as a 'ladies' man' - then persuaded the 'vulnerable women' to give him money.

Giles covered his lies by creating back stories about his past, sending the women 'photos' of his latest working environment and even pretending that he lived in a house which he did not own.

The court also heard how he raised money for charity through a sponsored cycle ride, but handed over less than half of the total amount. 

Giles' tale has echoes of Frank Abagnale, who was played by Leonardo Di Caprio in the Steven Spielberg film Catch Me If You Can.

But on New Year’s Eve last year, Giles' fake identities were exposed when he was arrested at one of his victim's homes in East Devon.

The unsuspecting 40-year-old victim had believed Giles - who stole money from her - was a Qantas airline pilot.

During a hearing at Exeter Magistrates' 
Court, Giles admitted seven charges of fraud and theft between July and 
December last year.

The court heard he had already been convicted in December 2013 of posing as a policeman in Somerset - but was back conning more victims just months later.

At
 the same time he was pretending to be a pilot while dating another 
woman in Kingsteignton. He had also previously duped another woman into 
believing he was a fireman.

Now one of his victims has spoken out as a warning to other women who may fall for his lies.

Giles, from Blunsdon, near Swindon, swindled money out of women he met online by 
pretending he had a series of high flying jobs, including being a pilot, a policeman and a fireman

The mother-of-two, who was convinced he worked for Australian airline Qantas, revealed how she was conned into giving Giles £200 after a four-month romance.

She said: 'His story was that he was an airline pilot working for Qantas and had been doing for ten years.

'He said his parents lived in Australia where he used to work but he had moved to the company’s English base.

'He then moved to Devon and would stay at mine a lot and leave at silly o’clock to say he was driving back to Heathrow. I now know he was going to see another woman.

One of his victims, who believed he was an airline pilot for Qantas, 
said he had 'an answer for anything and everything' and had 'a complete 
life mapped out' 

'He had details about his job, parents, house and past life. He had a complete life mapped out but it was all just a fabricated mess.

'He would send me photos of where he was in the world. He would text me his ‘current view’ of a hotel or beach in the Indian Ocean.

'But it was all just downloaded off the Internet - just like the photo he initially sent me in a pilot’s uniform.'

The woman, who does not want to be named, said they chatted online for a long time before they met.

his past, and sending women photos of the foreign cities in which he was
 allegedly based - which he downloaded from the internet

She said: 'He kept coming around and 
worked on getting to know my children. He became very close to my son 
and they bonded over a love of planes.

'It all seemed to slip into place. I felt so happy that I went along with it all. He just won me over.

'But
 he stole £400 from my home and I lent him £200 as he claimed to have 
left his bank card in a hotel in Australia and couldn’t access his money
 over Christmas. I trusted him and thought I would get it back a few 
days later.

'He was here at 
Christmas and was in all the photos with my children. I thought he was 
becoming part of the family. I am so angry he has been allowed to do 
this.

'I never suspected anything, he seemed so genuine. He had visited my family and told them the same story.

'I had started to think a few things were not quite right but I still believed at the time he was arrested he was a pilot and lived in this house in West Hill.

'He had details about his job, 
parents, house and past life. He had a complete life mapped out but it 
was all just a fabricated mess'

One of Timothy Giles' victims

'He had shown me his home and we had pulled up outside. He told everyone we met he lived there and nobody suspected anything different. He had an answer for anything and everything.'

During the hearing, Exeter Magistrates' Court heard that Giles targeted vulnerable woman that he met through online dating agencies by posing as a career man.

Prosecutor Lindsey Baker said he took cash from a female victim he met through a dating agency who lives in east Devon.

She said: 'He was targeting vulnerable women while pretending to be someone that he is not.

Giles admitted seven counts of fraud and theft when he appeared at Exter Magistrates' Court. He is due to be sentenced at a later date

'One lady parted with money because he said he was an airline pilot and was a safe bet for the money to be repaid.

'He met her through a dating agency. He misled into forming a relationship claiming to be someone he was not for his own gain.'

Miss Baker said Giles also pocketed money he had ‘raised’ for the Children’s Hospice South West.

He only handed over £65 from the £190 he had been donated from the sponsored cycle ride.

He had also helped himself to the fuel provided by his company, a toilet firm, she said. 

The magistrates said the offences passed the custody threshold and ordered an all options report.

Giles, who was bailed before sentencing, told the court he could not appear for sentencing in August because he was jetting off on holiday with his latest lady friend, who was in court with him.
