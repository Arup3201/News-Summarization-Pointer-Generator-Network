Oxford-educated pianist Robin Zebaida pictured outside Isleworth Crown Court is accused of groping a 15-year-old girl while 'French-kissing' her mother

An internationally renowned concert pianist seduced and 'French kissed' a love-struck fan on his sofa while simultaneously fondling her 15-year-old daughter, a court heard today.

Oxford-educated Robin Zebaida, 49, had an arm around each of them after plying the pair with alcohol at his London home.

Isleworth Crown Court was told how the musician, who is a graduate of the Royal College of Music, groped the teenage girl while  embracing her mother.

The widow and her daughter met Zebaida in the summer of 2011 while he performed during a Mediterranean cruise.

'The mother and the defendant became friendly with each other and made arrangements to meet in England and some sort of romantic attachment may have grown as far as the mother and the defendant were concerned,' a jury heard.

The pair had travelled from their Essex home to Steinway studios in west London and to the Imperial War Museum, where the pianist who is also a certified masseur, claims to have given the girl an 'innocent' back-rub over her clothes.

They met for a third time at his north-east London home last November when the alleged incident took place.

'We sat on the sofa and he put some 
music on and we had some alcoholic drinks,' said the woman who cannot be named for legal reasons.

'My daughter had one or two vodka miniatures and I think he had some 
whiskey.

'He had an arm around each of us and he kissed me, which turned into a French kiss,' she said.

'It was a bit of a surprise.

'He had an arm around my waist and an 
arm around my daughter’s back and French kissed me several times within 
bouts of conversation.'

The jury heard how the woman and her daughter shared a sofa-bed in Zebaida's apartment that night, though the 15-year-old pleaded with her mother to leave. 

'She told me his hand had been under her shirt and against her stomach.'

The pair left early the next morning, despite the defendant allegedly asking them to stay.

'He said we should stay longer and began cuddling me and started undoing my bra,' added the girl's mother.

Three months later, the teenager told a counsellor about the alleged incident and police were informed.

Prosecuting Mark Gadsden told the jury: 'Mr Zebaida, as he brought his hand down on the girl's hip, put his hand under the top she was wearing on her bare flesh.'

'He stroked her there and moved his hand up to her breast, where her bra was, but did not touch her breast.

'He started kissing the mother, "smooching" as the daughter described it, French kissing.

The trial continues at Isleworth Crown Court in Hounslow, west London

'The daughter then lay on the floor complaining of the effects of the alcohol the defendant plied them both with.

'She had been drinking miniatures and consumed more than the adults.

'He coaxed her back on to the couch and caressed her thigh and bottom in a slow and deliberate way.'

The court heard how Zebaida also kissed the girl's neck in a way that she felt 'unable to stop happening.'

Zebaida also teaches music master classes around the world with the British Council, and is an examiner with the Associated board of the Royal Schools of Music.

British-born Zebaida pleaded not guilty to one count of sexual assault by touching.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
