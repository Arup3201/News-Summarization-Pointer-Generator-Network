Arsenal's Christmas reindeer has revealed himself, and unsurprisingly it is a familiar face under the mask.

With the Gunners set to face Queens Park Rangers on Boxing Day, they will certainly be hoping he can help deliver a much-needed three points to the Emirates stadium.

And it wasn't Rudolph or Blitzen, but was Arsenal's very own dasher and dancer Alexis Sanchez.

In the video uploaded to Arsenal's official Instagram page, Sanchez performs a series of his trademark flicks and tricks before revealing himself to be Arsenal's festive reindeer.

Despite only joining in the summer, the Chilean has quickly elevated to one of the most popular players at the club, no doubt down to the fact that he has already scored 14 goals in 25 games so far.

In fact, it's difficult to envisage where the Gunners would be this campaign without him, as they currently sit sixth in the Premier League table.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger will be hoping that Arsenal can improve their form over the Christmas period

No doubt Arsene Wenger will be hoping that he helps to deliver for against Queens Park Rangers on Boxing Day, as Arsenal look to close the gap on the top four. 

And Arsenal boss Wenger is hoping that his side can show their true from over the hectic Christmas schedule.

'We have a good opportunity over Christmas to show that we are much better than people think we are,' he said.

'Every team has difficult games, so it is the consistency in that period that will matter.'
