Nibbling contentedly at a twig, this beaver is one of a group caught in an unprecedented conservation battle.

At least ten have made their home on the banks of a Devon river, to the delight of wildlife lovers.

But the first beavers to breed in the wild in England for 800 years face a threat from an unexpected quarter – the men from the ministry.

For officials from the environment department, Defra, say the creatures must be caught and culled or rehomed in zoos. They claim the beavers, which have been living and breeding on a 12-mile stretch of the River Otter for at least five years, may carry diseases that could harm other species or even pose a risk to human health. 

Whitehall has issued licences for pest controllers to round them up and cages have already been bought. But wildlife experts and conservationists have begun a court battle to save the beavers and 12,000 people have signed a petition to back their cause.

Environmental charity Friends of the Earth has started legal action in a bid to block Defra, claiming that rounding up the beavers would be illegal.

It says they are protected under European law and alternatives to their removal have not been properly considered.

The Devon Wildlife Trust agrees the beavers should be caught and tested for disease, but wants them returned to the river afterwards and has submitted a proposal to monitor them for a further five years. The trust’s Peter Burgess said: ‘They do not have a big negative impact. They have been there for four or five years and nobody has noticed, let alone complained. Beavers have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers.

‘They provide habitats for other species. Our rivers are not in great health and one solution is to have these natural engineers back in our watercourses.’

Friends of the Earth campaigner Alasdair Cameron said: ‘At a time when our wildlife is facing an unprecedented crisis, the Government should be taking steps to protect and expand the range of key native species like the beaver – not removing them.

Officials have claimed that beavers may carry diseases that could harm other species or even pose a risk to human health 

‘Beavers can bring many benefits – as well as injecting a little more joy into our landscape.’

Retired environmental scientist Tom Buckley, who spotted the first of the beaver group near Ottery St Mary a year ago, said: ‘There is an overwhelming majority of people are in favour of the beavers staying and being left alone by the Government.’

Beavers were wiped out by hunters in the Middle Ages and their reappearance in Devon remains a mystery. There are several captive breeding programmes, one 30 miles away. But none of the animals is missing.

A Defra spokesman said: ‘The beavers on the River Otter may carry a disease which could pose a risk to human health. That is why it’s our responsibility to take precautionary action.’

A bid to reintroduce beavers to the wild in Scotland is considered an outstanding success and has caused no threat to other species.

Five families were trapped in Norway and released into the remote forests and lochs of Knapdale in Argyll in 2009 and 2010.

Some died and some disappeared but others bred and 14 young – known as kits – have been born. The beavers have engineered dams 60ft long, while the biggest lodge is as large as a double garage.

Their presence has boosted local tourism, with more than 30,000 people taking part in walks, talks and education sessions and more than 200 school and college visits.

Those running the five-year trial say it has shown that beavers can live and breed in the Scottish countryside.

The results will be presented to the Scottish Parliament, which is expected to give the go ahead for the programme to be expanded.

However, it could also shut the project and order the beavers to be put down, or trapped and taken to a zoo.
