Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers faced a group of Boston's youngest journalists in his latest press conference.

The 41-year-old faced questions as wide-ranging as what lessons should be learnt from the World Cup and why Scousers have a strange accent to whether he thought draws in football should be decided by a race between managers.

On the USA's World Cup team he said: 'They were very much a team. They weren't individuals - they played together they played a system well.

'I think in general the World Cup was about the best teams. The best team won, which was Germany and the USA were a great team.'

When asked about America's World Cup chances  in the next 20 years, Rodgers seemed optimistic.

'I think they will go close,' he said, 'They have got better and better. The level of players is very high. To get out of the group stages was a great achievement.

'If they continue to make the improvement that has been made in the last 20 years then for sure they will go close.'

The former Swansea manager also said that if he had to coach an America sport it would be basketball, if he could see one musician ad Anfield it would be Shakira, and he can't help that he 'talks funny'.
