There are rumors of romance surrounding Caroline Wozniacki and Washington Redskins player Ryan Kerrigan after the pair attended a charity function together.

Wozniacki, whose engagement with top-ranked golfer Rory McIlroy ended very publicly this Spring, was pictured at the DC-area charity event with the linebacker on Monday night. 

According to CSN Washington, the two spent the evening in close proximity and quiet conversation, though both declined to comment on their relationship status.

When they arrived at the live auction to benefit a D.C. area high school athletic department, Kerrigan hovered by the 24-year-old's side and looked on slightly awkwardly as she chatted to fellow guests.

Kerrigan, 26, spoke at the event, but not about his date, and Wozniacki turned down attempts for interviews. 

Later in the night they were snapped talking as they sat down at a table, although they were careful to remain neutral in their body image.

Wozniacki, who is worth an estimated $24million, was due to be married last month, but McIlroy ended their relationship at the end of May this year, just days after the couple sent out their wedding invitations.

At the time, the Northern Irish golfer said the end of the three-year relationship was 'mutual and amicable' - but now Wozniacki has revealed McIlroy broke up with her out of the blue during a ten-minute call and did not even give her 'a face-to-face'. 

Speaking about the break-up, she told In Depth With Graham Bensinger on Yahoo! News: 'It was very hard because he made it very public from the start. He put out a press release so I didn't have a choice, you know, it just got put in my face.

'Oh I was shocked. I thought at least, you know, I would get a face to face or something. But there was nothing – it was just a phone call and I did not hear from him again. 

''I don't think you expect to find yourself in a situation like that, you can't prepare yourself or your body for anything like that so I think I was in a bit of a shocked phase there for a while.' 

She said after she was left 'shocked', but says she now intends to date a taller man.

Multi-millionaire McIlroy, who won the coveted British Open in July, announced he and Wozniacki had split earlier this year because he was not ready for 'all that marriage entails'.

He later said in a statement released through Dublin-based communications consultants that the 'problem is mine'.

At the time, he said it would be difficult to concentrate on the tournament on the back of a public break-up. But days later, McIlroy went on to win the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.

His form continued and, in July, he won the British Open by a clear margin, before going on to win the U.S. PGA Championship.

Kerrigan is having a good year for his team - he is currently in the top 10 in sacks and forced fumbles in the league, according to EPSN

He later claimed that the break-up was the reason behind his unstoppable form, saying: 'I think what happened has been for the best in terms of my golf.

'I've put a bit more time into it and it has refocused me. I mean, what else do I have to do now?'  

According to sources, their wedding was due to take place at the Rockefeller Centre in New York on November 8. 

In a statement after their break-up, McIlroy said: 'The problem is mine.

'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails.

'I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had.'
