Pensioner Dave Northcote has spent £55,000 on developing and manufacturing a device which helps put pillows into pillowcases

A pensioner has spent his life savings of £55,000 on an invention that helps put pillows into pillowcases - but has so far not sold a single device.

Former care agency boss Dave Northcote came up with the idea after struggling with the chore while recovering from an operation.

He has contacted major stores including Tesco, Sainsbury's and John Lewis, but has so far not sold any of the Easyfit devices, which have cost him and his wife their entire pension savings.

The grandfather of 27 is now looking for a manufacturer to mass produce the device - a U-shaped plastic tray which slides the pillow into its case.

Mr Northcote said his wife June, 67, is concerned about how much money has been spent on the invention, but he is confident it will take off.

He said: 'To me this invention is another cat’s eyes. It works 100 per cent every time with every kind of pillow, from great big bulky ones to ones with memory foam.'

The device comes in a deluxe 'Zoox' version, which is expected to retail for up to £15, and a £5 'Znooze' supermarket variety.

Mr Northcote said most of the money had been spent on buying and fitting an industrial unit in West Heath, Birmingham, along with materials, machines, prototypes, patents, design rights and the registered trademark.

He said: 'Both June and I have staked our entire pension savings of £55,000 but at no time did we give up hope that our patent would be granted.

The device works by compressing the pillow into a shape with is then more easily slid into a pillow case

Once inside the pillowcase, the pillow is then able to expand back to its original shape

'Once you’ve started, you’re committed to carrying on. We are living on our uppers, but we are happy as pigs in muck because we now have the patent and I have a lot of faith in this.

'Now at 68 and almost broke I feel it too late to start manufacturing and selling but we are hopeful someone will like our product enough to produce it under licence. And they can have a free one.'

Mr Northcote said he came up with the idea while recovering at home from major surgery to have bones in his right arm fused.

He said: 'I was doing chores around the 
home and successfully tackled them all, except for putting pillows in 
cases. It just came into my head. If you have a problem, solve it, my 
mother used to say.'

Mr Northcote said the device works by compressing the pillow into a shape which can then be placed into the pillow.

He said: 'Because pillows are getting bigger and plumper and are now a lot bigger than most pillow cases, this product compresses the pillow into a funnel, then it expands inside the case.'

He believes the invention could be used to save hours of work at hotels, hospitals and care homes.

He, his wife and their 40-year-old son Darren have already made 400 of the products and had them tested at hotels.
