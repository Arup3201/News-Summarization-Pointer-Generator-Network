More than one in three victims of anti-social behaviour say their calls to police have made no difference.

And the problem is even worse among those whose lives are made a misery by yobs in their neighbourhood. Nearly half of the victims who suffer the most said officers took no action.

Details of the scale of police failings over anti-social behaviour were revealed in a report by academics published yesterday.

Tragic: Fiona Pilkington suffered years of abuse

A survey of nearly 10,000 victims revealed that people tormented by gangs of thugs were most likely to ‘fall through the net’.

Critics said the study showed forces cannot be relied on to protect the public from threatening behaviour, vandalism and intimidation.

It came as one force was criticised for plans to categorise attacks on goths and punks as ‘hate crimes’.

Dr David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘Greater Manchester Police have announced they are going to pay special attention to groups identified by their lifestyle, clothing and make-up, such as goths and punks.

'This is another example of the police spending too much time trying to please pressure groups that demand preferential treatment. Instead, they should devote their resources to providing equal protection for all.’

The Cardiff University study comes more than five years after police were castigated for their failure to protect Fiona Pilkington and her disabled daughter Francecca.

After ten years of abuse and repeated failures by police and council officials, Mrs Pilkington killed herself and her daughter in 2007 by setting fire to their car in a layby near their home in Barwell, Leicestershire.

The survey found that people tormented by gangs of louts were mostly likely to 'fall through the net' (posed by models)

The study found that ‘the repeat and vulnerable victim’ was most likely to ‘fall through the net’.

It said 35 per cent of victims who made initial complaint calls to the police saw ‘no difference’, compared to 45 per cent of repeat victims.

The study looked at 9,311 victims who called police in England and Wales in a one-month period in 2011.

More than half said they called the police three or more times in a year and one in five made ten or more calls over a 12-month period.

It found the well-off and middle classes were among the most likely to be repeat victims. The survey found 47 per cent of those targeted more than once were from the A and B social classes.

The authors of the report, Professor Martin Innes and Dr Helen Innes, said their study ‘reaffirms that this type of problem is pervasive and has the potential to cause significant harm to the individuals concerned’.

They added that, ‘the repeat caller is often an individual who feels that their first report of anti-social behaviour has been, or continues to be, unsuccessful’.

A police spokesman said they would get better at identifying vulnerable victims.  

The report was published alongside data from the police inspectorate which scored forces on how well they were tackling the problem.

The Met, the country’s largest force, was among the worst performers, along with the Gwent, Wiltshire and Essex forces. Top were Lancashire and West Mercia.
