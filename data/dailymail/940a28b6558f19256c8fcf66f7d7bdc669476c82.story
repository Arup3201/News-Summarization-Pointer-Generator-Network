Beleaguered heiress Kerry Kennedy has been quietly seeking comfort from sexy 90210 actor Trevor Donovan, who is 19 years her junior. 

'Trevor and Kerry have been tight for a couple of years. They travel around the world together,' a Kennedy family member revealed to MailOnline.

'Kerry called Trevor shortly after the DUI accident', Michael Yanni, Trevor’s manager, told MailOnline.

Closer: Hunky 90210 actor Trevor Donovan, 35, shares a special bond with Kerry Kennedy, 54, despite their 19-year age difference. They were introduced by his manager several years ago

Aprez-ski cuddle: Trevor and Kerry,  here in Park City, Utah in 2012, are avid skiers. Trevor has also joined the Kennedy clan at their Hyannis Port, Mass. retreat and he's considered an honorary member of the family

The niece of President John F. Kennedy was arrested by police in Westchester County, NY in July, 2012 after crashing into a truck during a wild ride down the interstate highway in her Lexus SUV while under the influence of Ambien. She was acquitted of DUI today by a jury in White Plains, New York.

'Trevor was supportive - he’d never seen her drunk or under the influence when he’s been out with her,' said Yanni, a human rights activist who introduced 54-year-old Kerry to Donovan several years ago.

The 35-year-old actor became a poster boy for women - and men - when he won the role of Teddy Montgomery in 90210 in 2009.

Donovan’s character morphed from a serial dater of women to an out-of-the-closet gay man in the series.

Asked about being a straight man playing a gay character, Donovan said at the time: 'It’s been good for me. Girls want to challenge it. They kind of assume I’m gay in real life and want to change me back. Of course I let them.'

Donovan famously did a steamy 'reverse cowgirl', straddling actress Sandra Echeverria in Oliver Stone’s 2012 drug dealer film, Savages.

Party harty: Trevor has been to numerous events with Kerry but has never seen her get drunk or do drugs

Ripped: Trevor was hands on with British beauty Kelly Brook at a modeling shoot in California

9021 OH: Life's a beach for the TV star. Trevor was always a fan fave--and is there any question why!

Kennedy, 54, the seventh child of the late Robert F. Kennedy, runs the RFK Center for Justice and Human Rights and travels extensively as an advocate for children and women.

The couple connected a few years ago when Donovan volunteered at the organization and have been close ever since.

Donovan has been included in ski vacations with the family and has even been a guest at the exclusive Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Mass.

They have been photographed in public together several times— his arm placed lovingly around her.

Donovan has called her his 'besty' and revealed that Kerry and her mother, 85-year-old Ethel, made him an 'honorary Kennedy'.

While there's no suggestion they're anything other than very close friends - Donovan has been tweeting recently about going on a series of blind dates - Kennedy family members worry that Kerry’s relationship with Donavan could spark additional censure for the controversial family.

'Trevor and Kerry are extremely low 
key and discreet. But there is great affection between them. They are 
soul mates and have the same passions for social justice, outdoor sports
 and animals', the family member told MailOnline.

Kennedy
 has three daughters with her ex-husband, New York State Governor Andrew
 Cuomo, Michaela, 17, and twins Cara and Mariah, 19.

Kennedy’s
 marriage to Cuomo exploded in 2003, when it was revealed she was having
 an affair with a handsome polo playing multi-millionaire named Bruce 
Colley, then 50.

Trying times: Kennedy was arrested for driving under the influence after she crashed her SUV in 2012. She was accompanied by sister Rory Kennedy, left, at the trial. Trevor has offered his full support of his "besty"

Cuomo, who reportedly had himself been having a series of extra-marital affairs, promptly divorced the Kennedy heiress.

Sources close to the families have revealed that the Cuomo/Kennedy union was basically an arranged marriage meant to unite the two powerful American political dynasties and revive the badly sagging Kennedy brand.

Years of scandal - from posthumous revelations about JFK’s sexual exploits with movie stars such as Marilyn Monroe and mob molls like Judith Campbell Exner to Ted Kennedy’s drunken plunge into the sea where a female aide drowned - did little to bring back the glory days of Camelot.

Even tragic John F. Kennedy Jr., who famously denounced his Kennedy cousins as 'poster boys for bad behavior', had a tumultuous marriage with a reportedly cocaine-addicted wife.

Cheating & lies: Kerry Kennedy married now NY Governor Andrew Cuomo in Washington DC in 1990. But 13 years later they split after her scandalous affair with polo player Bruce Colley was revealed

Blind Date: Trevor has admitted that he's been dating. He was spotted lunching with a brunette at King's Road Cafe in Hollywood during the trial.  But the actor has tweeted how much he misses Kerry

Donovan has not been at Kennedy’s side at the New York trial, remaining in Los Angeles where he is working on several projects.

On November 22, Trevor tweeted Kerry: 'Miss you friend'.

Family sources believe that now the trial is over and Kerry can focus once again on her human rights work, they will pick up where they left off. Yanni says they are 'best friends'.
