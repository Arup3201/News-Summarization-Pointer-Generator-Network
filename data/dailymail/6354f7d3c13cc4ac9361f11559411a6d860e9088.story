The Duchess of Cambridge is to move back in with her mother when her baby is born.

In a break with royal tradition, Kate, 31, will not employ a maternity nurse after the July birth.

Instead, she has told friends, she will live with her parents for at least the first six weeks after leaving hospital.

Support: The Duchess of Cambridge is set to move in with her mother Carole Middleton following the birth of her first child, and future heir to the throne of Britain

First home: The royal baby will spend at least the first six weeks of his or her life at the Middleton's £4.85million manor in Berkshire

The decision means a future monarch 
will be starting life in a commoner’s home in Berkshire rather than in 
the splendour of a royal residence.

Kate
says she ‘just feels safest and most secure’ with her family and 
believes that no one could be better placed to teach her about bringing 
up a baby than her mother, who has three children of her own.

New tradition: The Duchess of Cambridge will not employ a maternity nurse

She
will particularly need her advice and moral support when Prince William
returns to work as a helicopter pilot after taking his paternity leave.

It also solves the 
niggling problem of where the newborn third-in-line to the throne will 
live for the first few weeks of his or her life.

Sources
have confirmed that William and Kate’s plans to move into a new 
apartment in Kensington Palace in time for the birth have hit a huge 
stumbling block.

This 
follows the discovery of asbestos – which has to be cleared before the 
couple themselves, let alone a new-born child, can set foot inside.

Kate’s
parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, recently bought a £4.85million 
Georgian manor in rural Berkshire with plenty of space for their first 
grandchild to run around.

A
recent visitor said Carole, who is ‘over the moon’ at the prospect of 
being a grandmother, is busy overseeing the redecoration of the house – 
including the installation of a new kitchen and ‘nursery-style’ room.

‘Carole
fully intends to be part of this baby’s life and Catherine, for her 
part, plans to spend a lot of time with her parents, especially while 
she is waiting for the new apartment to be completed,’ they said.

‘And surely it is no bad thing this little prince or princess is given a taste of life outside of the Royal Family?’

At the moment, Kate and William 
are shuttling between their rented farmhouse in Anglesey, where William 
is based as a Search and Rescue pilot with the RAF, and Nottingham 
Cottage, a relatively modest two-up, two-down in the grounds of 
Kensington Palace.

They had hoped to move into their new home, the 57-room Apartment 1A – well before the arrival of their first child.

Prince Harry is to take part in a perilous charity trek to the South Pole with a group of seriously injured ex-servicemen.

The 28-year-old, who recently returned from a second tour in Afghanistan, will join a British team in the Walking With The Wounded South Pole Allied Challenge 2013.

The challenge involves three teams from the UK, US and Commonwealth (Australia and Canada) racing across the Antarctic to the geographic South Pole. It aims to highlight the courage and determination of those who have been injured while serving their country.

Over four weeks in November and December, the teams will cover a total of 210 miles in temperatures as low as -45C and 50mph winds.

In 2011 Harry spent five days with another team from the Walking With The Wounded charity trekking to the North Pole before being forced to return home early to prepare for his brother’s wedding.

But,
according to one well-placed source, Kate conceived almost as soon as 
they started trying for a baby following their official tour to the 
South Pacific last year, meaning it has become a race against time to 
get their new home ready.

This week, however, the source said their scaffold-covered apartment is still ‘virtually uninhabitable’.

Aides
confirmed the apartment was unlikely to be ready until at least 
September or October, meaning the new third-in-line to the throne will 
endure something of a peripatetic existence for the first few months of 
their young life.

Prince William was born in the private
Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital Paddington, where Kate is also widely 
expected to give birth. Afterwards he was taken home by Charles and 
Diana to their apartment at Kensington Palace.

Diana
employed a paediatric nurse, Anna Wallace, to help her with William for
the first month, after which a nanny, Barbara Barnes, moved in.

÷
 US magazine Time has named Kate for the third year running as one of 
the 100 most influential people in the world – alongside the likes of 
Barack Obama and the Pope.

The publication described her as ‘dignified, dutiful and unflappable’.
