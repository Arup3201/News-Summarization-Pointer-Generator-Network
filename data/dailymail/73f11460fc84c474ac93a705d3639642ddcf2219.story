At the height of war, in the dead of night, the Halifax HR980 bomber was struck from the ground as it raced over Berlin in 1943, and plunged into a marsh.

The World War Two aircraft was crushed by the impact and sank into the murky water, where five brave servicemen on board have lain trapped for 70 years.

Generations later the wreckage has been found in a shock discovery signalling a long-awaited moment of closure for their families.

Crashed: During a night raid on August 23, 1943, (left-right) Sgt Arthur Cox, Flt Sgt William Burgum, Flt Sgt Harley Harber, and (in front) Sgt Donald Hemstock were shot down over Berlin. Cox (far left) was one of just two German soldiers recovered and buried before the plane sank into the murky water

Sgt Peter Buck and Flt Sgt Gordon Harrison are both still trapped in the wreckage in the tiny village of Gollin

Now, the team of German archaeologists have been granted permission to recover the wreckage and bodies, prompting the brothers, sisters, and children of the Halifax airmen to demand a proper burial for their loved ones from the government.

The men were deployed for a night raid over Nazi Germany on August 23, but never returned home.

Enemy soldiers pulled two bodies from the wreckage before the plane sank from view into a marsh near Gollin, 35 miles north of the capital.

While Australian air gunners Flt Sgt Harley Harber, 27, and Sgt Arthur Cox, 
age unknown, were recovered and buried in the Berlin 1939-45 war cemetery, the others were deemed 'missing'.

But this year, German aviation archaeologists announced a shock discovery as the marsh, which is now drying up, has pushed the wreckage back to the surface.

Aviation archaeologists have scoured the area for years but only as the marsh dried up have found the plane

Delighted family members are desperate to see their loved ones finally honoured and buried.

Pat Davies, 93, the sister of trapped navigator Sgt Peter Buck, said: 'It would be a nice thing for them to finally be laid to rest in a proper burial.

'I think the government should do something - they went down protecting the country and doing their duty.

'Peter really loved flying and the crew were great friends.'

Mrs Davies, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, added: 'We just weren't told anything at the time - it was quite extraordinary.

'One letter came and said the plane went down and roughly where it happened. That is all we ever heard.

The family of Flt Sgt William Burgum was one of the five told their relative was 'missing' after the HR980 crashed

'I don't know what happened to the letter - I expect my mother did away with it.

'We never had any more details about what had happened to them after that.'

The team of German archaeologists, who discovered the bomber crash site in 2002, have been given permission by the German authorities to recover the wreckage.

The families of the airmen are calling on the British government to help fund the £50,000 project.

John Williams, whose aunt was fiancée to air gunner Flt Sgt Harber, has worked with German archaeologists to rediscover the bomber crash site.

He said: 'These airmen died a long way from home. They left to fight for a better world and died for it.

Action: The recovery project set to be undertaken by these archaeologists will cost £50,000

The team discovered the site in 2002 but have spent years rallying for permission to extract the craft

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it is not custom to fund recovery projects but if bodies are found, measures will be taken to ensure they are buried properly. The plane will most likely be donated to a museum

'We owe them a debt we can never repay but it is important to give them a decent burial and for them to be with their fellow crew members.

'A team has now been put together to recover the remains of the remaining trapped crewmen.

'All we are waiting for is a decision from the British and German governments as to which one is responsible for the operation.'

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: 'The MoD does not fund archaeological digs of historic aircraft.

'However, if human remains are found, in co-operation with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the MoD will inform families, fund a burial in the local area where the remains are found, and support close family members attending a funeral service, if appropriate with a level of official ceremonial support.

'UK aircraft belong to Her Majesty's Government, however on conclusion of the formalities, we normally gift the remains of the aircraft if a local museum is willing to take them.'
