European human rights judges rejected Former Labour Cabinet Minister Geoff Hoon's claims to have been unfairly treated by a Parliamentary inquiry

Former Labour Cabinet Minister Geoff Hoon suffered a fresh humiliation yesterday when European human rights judges rejected his claims to have been unfairly treated by a Parliamentary inquiry.

Mr Hoon said Parliamentary authorities had been wrong to punish him after he was exposed trying to use his status as a former Defence Secretary to make large sums of money.

But the European Court of Human Rights brusquely rejected the charges as ‘manifestly ill-founded’.

The defeat meant the end of a legal battle lasting nearly five years that began when Mr Hoon was caught out by a newspaper sting in March 2010.

Mr Hoon, who was still an MP at the time, went to a meeting with a company calling itself Anderson Perry Associates and discussed providing it with advice on defence matters.

He told company executive Claire Perry that he was looking forward to ‘translating my knowledge and contacts about the sort of international scene into something that, bluntly, make money.’ He told Miss Perry that he charged £3,000 a day.

But the consultancy was really a front for the Sunday Times and Channel 4’s Dispatches programme and Mr Hoon, who was at the time a special adviser to the Nato Secretary General, was one of a number of politicians targeted. Others included one-time Labour ministers Stephen Byers and Patricia Hewitt.

Mr Hoon’s exposure was followed by a complaint by another MP to Parliamentary authorities, and an inquiry by the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee.

The Committee called on Mr Hoon to apologise to the Commons, and it effectively banned him from the Palace of Westminster by withrawing his Parliamentary pass for five years.

Mr Hoon, who was Defence Secretary from 1999 to 2005, and a Cabinet Minister until 2009, complained to the Strasbourg human rights court that the inquiry was not a fair trial and interfered with his civil rights, and that by damaging his reputation it had breached his right to a private and family life.

The Strasbourg judges, headed by Latvian Ineta Ziemele, said that Mr Hoon had no reason to complain that he did not get a fair hearing because the dispute was political and not a matter of his civil human rights. It said his complaint was inadmissible.

It also rejected his complaint under Article Eight of the European human rights charter, which protects private and family life. The human rights court said that although the damage to his reputation caused by the inquiry might have breached his human rights, the Committee had followed the rules of the Commons.

It said that while Mr Hoon had suffered damage to his reputation, it was more important to maintain freedom of speech.
