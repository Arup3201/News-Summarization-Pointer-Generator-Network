Seemingly nonsensical notes in the margins of a rare edition of Homer’s Odyssey have remained unread for 150 years.

Until a competition was launched to crack the code in the 1504 Venetian edition of the Odyssey, which contains annotations in an unknown script thought to have been written in the mid-19th century.

An Italian computer engineer has won the challenge and has finally solved the mystery – to find that the notes are written in a form of French shorthand.

Code cracked: An Italian computer engineer has solved the mystery of what these strange scribbes mean in a rare 16th century copy of Homer's the Odyssey.He found that the notes are written in French shorthand

The script is a system of shorthand invented by Jean Coulon de Thévénot in the late 18th century.

The annotations are mostly French translations of words and phrases from the Greek text.

'Every consonant and vowel has a starting shape and they combine together to form new shapes representing syllables,’ code breaker Mr Metilli wrote.

'The vertical alignment is especially important, as the position of a letter above or below the line, or even the length of a letter segment can change the value of the grapheme. This explains why most notes in the Odyssey shorthand are underlined - the line being key to the transcription.'

The case of the mystery marginalia began 
when the University of Chicago received a donation of Homer’s works from
 collector M.C. Lang in 2007, which included the 1504 volume with the 
unusual notes.

The university library’s Special Collections Research Centre lured linguists, classicists and amateur sleuths to identify and translate the script with a cash prize of $1,000, (£592) which was won by Daniele Metilli, who is studying a digital humanities course at the university.

Working with Giula Accetta - a colleague who is proficient in contemporary Italian stenography and fluent in French - he identified the mystery script as a system of shorthand invented by Jean Coulon de Thévénot in the late 18th century and two runners-up reached the same conclusion.

The annotations themselves are mostly French translations of words and phrases from the Greek text of the Odyssey.

They include lines from the epic poem such as: 'τὴν πάντες μνώοντο περικτίται, meaning 'whom all the neighboring princes wooed.'

Daniele Metilli, discovered that the script is a system of shorthand invented by Jean Coulon de Thévénot in the late 18th century and won a $1,000 competition at the University of Chicago to translate text that has remained illegible for 150 years

To crack the code, the duo began with the assumption that it was a system of French stenography in use in the mid-19th century as the notes were dates April 25, 1854.

After rejecting several 19th-century French stenographic - or shorthand - systems, they found a chart comparing one of them to the ‘tachygraphie’ or shorthand system invented by Mr Thévenot.

They found an 1819 edition of the work online and armed with two contemporary French translations of the Odyssey - one published in 1842 and the other in 1854 - they began the work of decoding the annotations.  

In Mr 
Thévenot’s system, ‘every consonant and vowel has a starting shape and 
they combine together to form new shapes representing syllables,’ 
Metilli wrote.

‘The
 vertical alignment is especially important, as the position of a letter
 above or below the line, or even the length of a letter segment can 
change the value of the grapheme. This explains why most notes in the 
Odyssey shorthand are underlined - the line being key to the 
transcription.’

The annotations in the book are mostly French translations of words and phrases from the Greek text of the Odyssey, which features here Odysseus, who in this 1920s illustration is homesick

They translated one line of script to read: 'que recherchaient tous les princes dans les entours,' which is a word-for-word translation of a line from the poem: 'whom all the neighboring princes wooed'.

Mr Metilli wrote in his blog: 'This is our best match for now and it gives us the certainty that the method we employed is correct,' and shared other examples.

In the poem, Ulysses says that Neptune disguised himself as Enipeus and laid with Tyro at the mouth of the river.

The person making the notes has underlined important words and written them in shorthand beside the main text, including 'prendant donc sa ressemblence,' which means 'taking his resembelence,' and 'embouchure' for mouth of the river.

There are times when the writer gets a translation wrong and makes corrections in their translation of the Greek, mistaking the word 'vain' for 'sterile', for example.

Mr Metilli and Ms Accetta are continuing to study the annotations and hope to discover the identity of their author and an explanation for why they only exist in one section of the text.

'We cannot help but feel a bit disheartened that after going this far we still know next to nothing about the annotator. Who is he or she? We do not know.There are no personal references,' he wrote.

'In the annotations, and in the few instances in which the author uses the ﬁrst person it is only to explain why he or she committed a translation mistake. What about the shorthand? It was very popular at the beginning of the 19th Century, but certainly not in 1854.

'Where did the annotator learn the code? What is the motive for its use? These remain open questions.'
