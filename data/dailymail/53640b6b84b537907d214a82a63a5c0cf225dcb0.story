America's position as the world's leading power inevitably makes it a love-it-or-hate-it nation.

Such is the complexity of global politics and conflict, its reputation is constantly in flux - whether its providing humanitarian aid with one hand or diving into a war with the other.

But a new survey has been released which could well give Washington a clearer idea about where to focus its attention in the coming years.

The Washington haters: Figures from the Pew Research Center reveal the top ten biggest critics of the U.S. based on a survey of citizens from 44 countries

Friction: The biggest anti-U.S. sentiment comes from Egypt, which will come as a blow to President Obama, who made a speech in 2009 (above) that promised to seek a 'new beginning' for the U.S. and Muslims

According to the Pew Research Center, which questioned citizens in 44 countries, anti-American sentiment features strongly in the Middle East, while many of those in favour come from Europe and Asia.

The biggest anti-American sentiment currently comes from Egypt, where 85 per cent held an unfavourable view of Uncle Sam.

Meanwhile, only 10 per cent showed support for the U.S., which is viewed as having failed to oppose the overthrow of long-serving president Hosni Mubarak by the Muslim Brotherhood.

The figures will come as a blow to President Barack Obama, who made an impassioned speech in Cairo in 2009 that promised to seek a 'new beginning' for the U.S. and Muslims in the wake of 9/11 and the subsequent Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

Fanbase: Many in favour of the U.S. come from Europe and Asia, with The Philippines its biggest supporter

Pro-Moscow militants guard the MH17 crash site: In Russia, pro-America reaction has plunged 28 points in just one year to 23 per cent in large part due to America's opposition to its intervention in Ukraine

America is in more danger than it has been for years because of the Islamic uprising in Iraq, a top U.S. intelligence official has warned.

Lt General Michael Flynn said Washington had been taken by surprise by the lightning offensive by ISIS despite knowing about their growing influence months ago.

He was speaking a national security forum in Aspen, Colorado, where various counter-terrorism officials warned that the U.S. was being threatened by several emerging threats in the Middle and Africa.

Asked if the United States was safer than it was a few years ago, he said: 'My quick answer is we're not.'

But he said officials are 'working to organize ourselves better,' it was reported by ABC News.Â 

Second in the list is Jordan (with 85 per cent against and 12 per cent in favour) followed by Turkey on 73 per cent.

Meanwhile, in Russia, which comes fourth, pro-America reaction has plunged 28 points in just one year to 23 per cent, while the number of critics has risen to 71 per cent.

This is perhaps unsurprisingly due to Washington's opposition to Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea earlier this year and its ongoing antagonism in Ukraine, where pro-Moscow rebels have been blamed for shooting down flight MH17, killing 295 people.

Palestinian territories complete the top five, with 66 per cent, but the 30 per cent who do like the U.S. is the highest since the survey started in 2002, according to GlobalPost.

At the other end of the spectrum, however, American still has its fair share of fans.

The Philippines are its strongest backers with 92 per cent and just 6 per cent opposed, followed by Israel (84 per cent), which GlobalPost notes has been sent some $115billion by the U.S. in foreign aid since the Second World War.

In third place is South Korea (82 per cent) then Kenya (80 per cent) and El Salvador (80 per cent).

In Europe, Italy comes out on top, with 78 per cent in favour.
