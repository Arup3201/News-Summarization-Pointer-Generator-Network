She's famous for her glossy chestnut locks but it seems that pregnancy has been taking its toll on the Duchess of Cambridge's beauty regime.

Touring the West Midlands with her hair in an elegant half-up hairstyle, a glimpse of grey could be seen peeping from beneath the knot holding it in place.

Of course, this is not the first time the 33-year-old royal has been snapped showing off a silver streak, with the most recent sighting coming early in January during a shopping trip.

Glimpse of grey: The Duchess of Cambridge showed off a streak of silver during her trip to the West Midlands

Part of the reason for the spate of recent silver sightings is her second pregnancy: the Duchess has reportedly given up many of her beauty treats in a bid to avoid harming her baby.

Hair dye is one such beauty essential often given a wide berth by mothers-to-be, although celebrity hairstylist Jo Hansford says going without isn't always required.

'Although colouring your hair doesn't affect pregnancy and there is no need to avoid it, some people do worry about the consequences,' she explained in an interview with MailOnline.

'Nevertheless, if someone is concerned, there are different techniques that can be used to avoid touching the scalp.

'For example, if they have an all over tint, they could revert to highlights. Alternatively, they could use a colour gloss that would add more depth and tone to the hair as well as enhancing the shine and condition.'

The Duchess of Cambridge is paying a visit to the Emma Bridgewater factory in Stoke-on-Trent today to inspect some charity pottery. And as expected, she looked as pretty as the prints on the plates!

She always dresses for the occasion (remember her boat print dress for her Portsmouth visit last week? Perfect!), and today she showed off her baby bump in a print dress from Seraphine with a blue coat by MaxMara. Blue for a boy, perhaps...?

It’s been a busy few weeks for Kate, and we’ve had plenty of opportunities to see what’s in her maternity wardrobe the second time around. Of course, Seraphine has featured highly, as well as some old favourites like L.K. Bennett. But when it comes to coats, MaxMara is a must!

No doubt the Duchess managed to fit in a spot of shopping whilst at the factory, and it's a good excuse for us to follow suit. Everything she touches turns to gold, so you’d better be quick off the mark if you want to copy Kate!

Not that Hansford is giving expectant mothers a license to go mad in the salon: 'We would always recommend seeking advice from a specialist before booking an appointment,' she warns.

Official NHS advice agrees, with the health service website explaining that the chemicals involved 'are not highly toxic' and concluding that it is safe to dye your hair while pregnant.

'Most research, although limited, shows that it’s safe to colour your hair while pregnant,' the advice continues.

'Some studies have found that very high doses of the chemicals in hair dyes may cause harm. 

'However, these doses are massive compared to the very low amount of chemicals a woman is exposed to when colouring her hair.'

Celebrity hair stylist Errol Douglas adds: 'I recommend vegetable dye and colour glosses to my clients when they're expecting. 

'They're safe and take them through those months with a gentle solution to keeping roots at bay.'

The Duchess herself is no stranger to hair dye and reportedly booked an emergency appointment with colourist Rossano Ferretti after unflattering photos of her greys were published in November 2013.

According to witnesses, Kate left his salon 'looking amazing' and her locks appearing 'big and glossy' after a £600 six-hour session with the Italian stylist.

But like many 30-something women, greys have become an increasingly regular occurrence for Kate, with friends saying the Duchess first noticed hers in the run-up to her first pregnancy.

To combat these, she had organic vegetable-based dye and subtle low-lights applied during regular four-hour visits to the Richard Ward Hair and Metrospa in Chelsea.

But, like the rest of us, she can't prevent further greying as she ages. Not, say stylists, that going silver is always a bad thing.

'Going grey marks nature’s way of softening the hair colour giving natural highlights as the skin pigmentation changes,' says celebrity stylist Daniel Galvin Jr.

'I always recommend using a semi-permanent colour with no ammonia or peroxide, to blend the grey hair and tone it down slightly.'
