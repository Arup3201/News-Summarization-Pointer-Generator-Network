Use of the extremely common ADHD medication Ritalin can cause dangerously long-lasting, unwanted erections with long-term use.

The Food and Drug Administration released a statement Tuesday announcing it will update its priapism, a condition that can permanently damage a patient's penis.

The stimulant drug in Ritalin, methylphenidate, is also found in the brand names Daytrana and Concerta--an extended release version often prescribed to adutls--among many others.

Possible side effects: Ritalin is one of many commonly prescribed stimulant medications that the FDA now warns causes a dangerous, long-lasting medical condition called priapism

Priapism is a long-lasting, sometimes painful erection that can last for several hours.

The condition occurs when blood becomes trapped in the penis.

The FDA says patients taking a methylphenidate product who experienced priapism ranged in age from 8 to 33 years old.

Patients experiencing priapism should see a doctor immediately.

If left untreated, the condition can cause permanent scarring and erectile dysfunction.

The agency warned people to talk to their doctors before halting the drugs and said priapism has only occurred from use of methylphenidate in rare cases.

Despite the condition's rarity, the shear popularity of drugs like Ritalin make it a cause for concern.

According to the New York Times, sales of stimulant ADHD medications have more than doubled since 2007, from $4 billion to a whopping $9 billion in 2012.

Parents should discuss warning signs with younger boys using the stimulants, who who may be embarrassed to talk about the symptoms.

Medical help should be sought for patients on the stimulant who develop erections lasting longer than four hours.

ADHD is a common disorder that hampers a one's ability to pay attention and control behavior. Medications that use the stimulant can help increase focus and reduce impulsivity in patients.

The FDA said patients taking a methylphenidate product who experienced priapism ranged in age from 8 to 33 years old, with a median age of 12 and a half.

Priapism happens when blood becomes trapped in the penis, leading to abnormally long-lasting erections.

ADHD treatments have received FDA scrutiny before.

Isolated reports of heart attacks and strokes in kids taking the drugs caused worry and prompted a study a few years ago that concluded the treatments don't raise the risk of serious heart problems.

Commonly prescribed: The possible side effect of Ritalin and other drugs containing methylphenidate is rare. However, the sale of such stimulant medication has spiked in recent years, meaning more patients need to be aware of the the potential risks
