Manchester City are finalising a £3million move for Argentine midfielder Bruno Zuculini of Racing.

The 21-year-old is in England for his medical. City are allowing Marcos Lopes, 18, to join Lille on loan for a season.

City will also increase their efforts to sign Eliaquim Mangala from Porto even though Mehdi Benatia has made it clear he wants to leave Roma.

Raring to go: Zuculini is signing for Manchester City from Racing

City consider Benatia an alternative to France defender Mangala although both have expressed a preference to join Chelsea.
