A naked man was saved by police officers Tuesday morning after he reportedly dove into a river during a police chase.

Prior to the rescue, the suspect 'was trying to break into vehicles' and 'going from vehicle to vehicle,' KCTV5 said.

Rescue: A Kansas City, Missouri police officer approaches the suspect in the Blue River

Kansas City, Missouri police told the station the man, whom they said was under the influence of drugs and behaving strangely, was arrested and handcuffed before he went into the water.

The man tried to run away from police before he 'ran down the embankment, took his clothes off and jumped into the [Blue River],' the station said.

Video shot by KCTV5 shows the handcuffed man in the water having trouble trying to stay afloat in the river. An officer is seen out of uniform and wearing a tank top swimming toward the man and eventually carrying him through the water.

Police told the station two officers went to save the man before others helped him out of the river.

The man was hospitalized, police also said.

The man was later identified by KCTV5 as veteran and PTSD sufferer Geoffrey Jenista.

'He's a veteran who had served multiple tours overseas. He'd seen lots of combat. He was suffering from PTSD,' Sgt. Michael Ward told the station. 'Somebody that serves our country, you know, bravely like that, we're not going to turn our backs on him. We're going to try to help him.'

A request for information to the Kansas City Police Department was not immediately returned.
