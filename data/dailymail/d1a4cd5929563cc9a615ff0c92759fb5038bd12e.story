When asked who was his toughest opponent, Shaw said: 'That's a tough one but I'm going for Victor Moses, purely for his pace and power found it a very difficult test.'

Shaw also revealed that 'Arsenal away was the hardest game of the season' and if he had the choice to play another position he 'would want to be a forward, scoring goals must be a great feeling and that's something I haven't felt.'

The 18-year-old was
 selected ahead of Chelsea's Ashley Cole in Roy Hodgson's 23-man World 
Cup squad and when he received the call the 'first person I told was my 
mum'.
