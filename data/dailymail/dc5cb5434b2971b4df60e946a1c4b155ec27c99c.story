Twelve struggling towns offered help from TV guru Mary Portas to save their high streets still have fewer shops than two years ago, it emerged today.

The businesswoman and presenter was hired by the government to turn around town centres in places like Bedford, Dartford and Margate, with a share of a £1.2million fund.

But two years on, there are still 53 fewer shops in their dozen towns than before the project started, with Labour claiming it is 'politically embarrassing' for the government.

The plight of town centres was thrown into the spotlight in the wake of the recession, when a revival in the economy was not matched by empty stores reopening.

The loss of big names like Woolworths, Zavvi, Whittard and JJB Sports from many high streets was accompanied by the rise of charity and betting shops.

In 2012, Portas was appointed by the government to bring about a revival in areas worst affected by the economic downturn and the rise of out-of-town shopping centres.

The first 12 Portas Pilot towns were Bedford in Bedfordshire, Croydon in Greater London, Dartford in Kent, Bedminster in Bristol, Liskeard in Cornwall, Margate in Kent, Market Rasen in Lincolnshire, Nelson in Lancashire, Newbiggin by the Sea in Northumberland, Stockport in Greater Manchester, Stockton on Tees in Teesside and Wolverhampton in the West Midlands.

They were promised an injection of life, with more markets, better branding and pop-up shops. Ideas included ‘guerilla gardening’, street art, town criers and bicycle rickshaw services.

However, many of her main recommendations including free parking and cheaper business rates were not taken up by ministers.

After a year of the project, the total number of shops in the first 12 Portas Pilot towns had fallen by 95. 

New research by the Local Data Company shows things are improving, but are still not back to the level seen in 2012.

In the last 12 months, there has been a net increase of 42 in the number of shops in the first pilot areas, according to research commissioned by BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme.

This means the number of shops is still 53 lower than it was two years ago.

In the first 12 Portas Pilot towns, there are still 52 fewer shops than there were two years ago. The towns are Bedford in Bedfordshire, Croydon in Greater London, Dartford in Kent, Bedminster in Bristol, Liskeard in Cornwall, Margate in Kent, Market Rasen in Lincolnshire, Nelson in Lancashire, Newbiggin by the Sea in Northumberland, Stockport in Greater Manchester, Stockton on Tees in Teesside and Wolverhampton in the West Midlands.

Labour MP Adrian Bailey, chairman of the business select committee, told the BBC: ‘The response was inadequate to actually transform the fortunes of the high streets in those selected areas.

‘These are pilots. Now, you would normally expect the government when they have introduced pilot schemes to have some process for assessing how they have worked, then doing a report and then making recommendations arising from the evidence that they have got there.

‘None of that appears to have taken place.

‘So I think the inevitable conclusion you can draw is this was really a political response to the Portas recommendations and is now being exposed as not delivering and potentially politically embarrassing to the government.’

The government argues that across the country shop vacancy rates are down to their lowest level since 2010, at 13.4 per cent in June.

High Streets Minister Penny Mordaunt insisted Portas Pilots and Town Teams are ‘helping to drive the local economy, boost business and adopt shopper-friendly parking policies’.

She added: ‘The main aim of the scheme has always been to harness the energy and enthusiasm of the local community and give them the freedom to try out their ideas. This is a long term project, but pilots are already showing what is possible.

‘From Nelson getting empty shops back into use to Braintree developing 10p parking initiatives.

‘The Government’s long term economic plan is supporting high streets. We have provided over £1 billion of business rates support which includes the doubling of small business rate relief and a reoccupation discount of 50 per cent for businesses taking on long-term empty shops.’
