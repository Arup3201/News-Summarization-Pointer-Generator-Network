They pulled in a strong showbiz crowd to fill the front row of their spectacular catwalk show at Somerset House last month.

And now Tesco clothing label F&F have released the sharp campaign images to go with their AW13 menswear campaign, fronted by Spanish model of the moment Jon K, and revealed exclusively on the MailOnline.

The sophisticated selection of sartorial ensembles appear unlike anything one might expect from an affordable fashion brand.

The campaign is fronted by Spanish supermodel Jon K, who has fronted Tom Ford, Hugo Boss and more

The collection features olive green, burgundy, navy, marl, neutrals, black and stonewash denim. Prints are kept to a minimum with the odd striped scarf or checked shirt as standout separates.

Roll-necks styled with quilted jackets, parkas teamed with tartan shirts and thrown over sharp suits, the season's offering appeals to gentlemanly elegance with a street edge throughout. 

The collection marks a landmark occasion for the brand, which is seeking to give the customer more fashion and trend-led items of the best quality while still maintaining affordability.

F&F say of their collection: 'The season that lies ahead symbolises bravery and a carefree attitude.

'We
see the F&F woman come full circle from ladylike chic to rebel with
a cause; a smart, independent, modern woman with a desire to challenge 
the ordinary and tear up the rule book.'

Sought-after model Jon K made an 
entire audience of fashionistas swoon at the first ever F&F Catwalk 
show at Somerset House on 16 May as he made a spectacular runway appearance.

Jon previously worked with Tom Ford 
for seven back-to-back campaigns (a rarity in the industry), 
Karl Lagerfeld, Hugo Boss and Roberto Cavalli, and has won a number of modelling awards.

'Jon K embodies the new F&F agenda; bravery, inspiring customer to wear what they want, however they want'

With razor-sharp cheekbones and killer looks, Jon K is a wise choice to front the F&F range

The front row was 
studded with celebrity faces, including rugby player Thom Evans 
and his new girlfriend, 90210's Jessica Lowndes, TOWIE's Lauren Pope and Denise Van 
Outen.

Alexandra Burke and friend and fellow model Petra Nemcova commented on the young model’s dashing young 
looks.

According to the brand, Jon
K 'embodies the new F&F agenda; bravery. Inspiring the F&F 
customer to wear what they want, when they want and however they want to
wear it'.

Pairing a casual jacket such as a parka or bomber with a smart work outfits looks understatedly cool

with all pieces designed to mix-and-match across formal and casual-wear.

Prices reach £70 for a suit jacket.

All items will be available this autumn, with the full collection also available online at clothingattesco.com.
