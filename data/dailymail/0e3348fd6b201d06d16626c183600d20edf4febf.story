Robin Roberts spoke for the first time on GMA today about her long-time girlfriend Amber Laign as she showed a photo of them happily posing together at a family wedding.

The morning show anchor, who battled cancer in 2012, was choked with emotion as she talked about her relationship, saying: 'I have never been happier or healthier than I am right now'.

Ms Roberts spoke about her Christmas vacation to the Turks and Caicos Islands with Ms Laign, 39, to her co-hosts on Monday, revealing that the couple also attended the wedding of Roberts' niece in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The 53-year-old presenter then showed a family wedding shot which included her girlfriend.

The GMA star said: ''My year in post was just full of gratitude and telling everyone all that I'm grateful for, including my girlfriend Amber who really loved me through a very difficult year and I'm very happy for the support.'

At the end of last year, Ms Roberts
 posted a picture of herself gazing into the ocean as the sun sets over 
the beach on the Turks and Caicos Islands.

And
 after saying she was looking forward to celebrating a 'glorious new 
year' with Amber, Robin wrote: 'My loved ones and I thank the beautiful 
people of Turks & Caicos for your hospitality.#SweetSerenity'.

Robin
 and Amber also spent Christmas on the beach as the 53-year-old star 
said she was 'grateful to be with loved ones', posting a picture of a 
sign propped up on the sand, reading: 'Let it Snow Somewhere Else!'

Amber's family last month told MailOnline they were happy and supportive of the 
couple's romance, as Amber's mother Andrea Laign revealed she and her 
husband Paul had met Robin and given their blessing to the relationship.

Speaking from the family home in Clayton, near Concord, Northern California, Mrs Laign said: 'We are very, very happy for them. Her dad and I and the whole family are very happy and totally supportive.'

For the past 10 years, Robin kept her romance with Amber out of the spotlight - until she 
chose to publicise their relationship yesterday.

However,
 Amber has secretly been by Robin's side and has joined her at a string 
of public events - watching on proudly as she sat next to her 
girlfriend's sisters as the GMA anchor was honoured with the ESPN's 
Arthur Ashe Award For Courage in in July.

Amber, a massage therapist who 
studied with the Swedish Institute of Health Sciences, graduated from 
Clayton Valley High School in 1992. The family moved to California from 
 Lebanon, New Jersey, where Amber attended the Round Valley Middle 
School.

In a rare public 
appearance, Amber, 39, looked elegant with her blonde hair swept up and 
wearing a grey gown, as she sat sandwiched in between Robin's sisters 
Sally-Ann and Dorothy and 
was caught on camera at the ESPN awards in July.

The
 pair were also pictured together as they arrived at the Women's 
Basketball Coaches Association awards in Covington, Georgia, where Robin
 annually hands out her broadcasting scholarship award.

And as Robin appeared on 
the Oscars red carpet in February - Amber was at Sir Elton John's Oscar 
bash, where they were later reunited.

They do live together at Robin's multimillion dollar apartment on Manhattan's Upper West side - however, Amber does own her own home.

Cancer survivor Robin, 53, thanked her girlfriend as part of a heartfelt end-of-year 
thank you addressed to fans and loved ones posted to her Facebook.

'I
 am grateful for my entire family, my long time girlfriend, Amber, and 
friends as we prepare to celebrate a glorious new year together,' 
Roberts wrote.

And Amber, a massage therapist, looks equally in love with Robin as they enjoyed a vacation together and even posted 'selfies' while on vacation in Hawaii with friends in August. They have also enjoyed trips to Fire Island together.

A source told MailOnline that Robin told ABC bosses of her decision to come out, adding: 'This was all Robin, she gave ABC a heads up on Sunday morning and told them she was going to post her message on Facebook. Of course she had everyone's support.'

Robin is the most popular woman on breakfast TV and her Q score - which measures the appeal of a celebrity - was most recently tested at 29 with adult women at 23 with adults over 18. In contrast, Savannah Guthrie on NBC's Today's show Q score is 12 with adults and 11 with women.

Meanwhile, Robin was inundated with messages of support from fellow celebs, including openly gay Ellen DeGeneres, who tweeted: 'Good Morning, America! Congratulations, Robin Roberts.'
