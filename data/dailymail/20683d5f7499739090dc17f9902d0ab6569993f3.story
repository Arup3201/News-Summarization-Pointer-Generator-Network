The National Basketball Association is one of the pre-eminent sport Leagues in the world and last Tuesday, the 2014-15 season commenced. 

Every Thursday, Bleacher Report will bring you a round-up of all the action on and off court Stateside.

HEADLINE-MAKER

Lebron James - The four-time NBA MVP made his long awaited return for the Cleveland Cavaliers. 

Four years, three months and 21 days on from his last match for the club, the Cavs fell to a 95-90 defeat at the hands of the London-bound New York Knicks in their season-opener.

James' return has not started as well as he would have hoped, with the Cavs losing their first game

The Cavs did hit back to win one game this week, but they are 1-3, despite a promising pre-season

Never afraid of hyperbole, the 10-time NBA All-Star told reporters before the game that the match was 'probably one of the biggest sporting events that's up there ever.' 

The hyped Cavs, after looking so connected during the pre-season, have underwhelmed so far and their record stands at 1-3.

GOOD WEEK

The Houston Rockets, Memphis Grizzlies and Golden State Warriors may still be unbeaten but the NBA's global expansion was the week's big winner. 

Tickets for 'NBA Global Games London 2015' featuring the Milwaukee Bucks and the New York Knicks sold out in a new record time.

The game, which will be played at The O2 on Thursday January 15, sold out inside an hour. It will be the fifth NBA regular-season game to be played in the capital and marks the ninth consecutive sell-out NBA contest at The O2, dating back to 2007.

BAD WEEK

The Los Angeles Lakers have won five NBA titles in the 21st century but have started with five consecutive losses for the first time since 1957, when they were still in Minneapolis. 

Their miserable start was compounded as rookie power forward Julius Randle crumbled to the hardwood after landing awkwardly on his right leg midway through the fourth quarter of the opening 108-90 loss to the Houston Rockets.

Bryant could be tempted to leave the franchise in 2016, despite previously stating he would stay for life

The Lakers confirmed that Randle had fractured his tibia and would be out for four to six months. 

Star man Kobe Bryant has said he'll remain a Laker for life but there is a definite possibility that the 16-time All-Star could look to leave the franchise in 2016.

BRIT WATCH

A record 101 international players from 37 countries were on opening night rosters for the 2014-15 season and they include two Brits. 

Luol Deng, who went to school in Croydon, made his Miami Heat debut as they defeated the Washington Wizards 107-95.

The two-time NBA All-Star scored 12 points as Miami began life without LeBron. Deng has averaged nearly 30 minutes on court per match as the defending champions have started the season with a 3-2 record. 

However Surrey's Joel Freeland, a power forward for the Portland Trail Blazers, has been sidelined because of a foot injury after playing six minutes in the opening two matches.

AND FINALLY

No chance of going hungry at the Time Warner Cable Arena this season as the Charlotte Hornets are selling a massive eight pound (that's 3.6kg) burger during their home games for the 2014-15 NBA season. 

The $75 burger on sale at the Time Warner Cable Arena weighs almost 4kg - maybe one to share with friends!

The burger is called 'Hugo's Boss,' has 14 patties and is divided into eight pieces. It will set you back $75.
