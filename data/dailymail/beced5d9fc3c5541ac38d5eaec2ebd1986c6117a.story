At least seven people were arrested Thursday morning in Manhattan after trying to disrupt the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade as part of a protest against the grand jury decision in Ferguson, Missouri.

The demonstrators used the hashtag #Stoptheparade on Twitter to rally supporters to their cause in New York City ahead of the holiday festivities.

'Listen, I am a big defender of parades. Basically #stoptheparade is just taking the existing parade & making it more meaningful, so win-win? wrote user Em Cameron Thursday morning.

Before the annual parade got under way at 9am, some 50 people gathered outside the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue carrying signs and chanting ‘No Justice! No peace!' and ‘Justice for Mike Brown!’

The group protesting the grand jury decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the August killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson walked down Fifth Avenue towards 37th Street, but then tried to enter the parade route on Sixth Avenue.

When officers posted along the street told the demonstrators that they were not allowed to be there, tempers flared and some of the marchers reportedly started pushing against NYPD barricades.

One of the marchers was arrested after he allegedly flipped over a trash can.

The station WNYW also reported that someone tossed an object from a building overlooking the parade path.

However, rally participants claim that cops attacked them for no reason.

All told, seven people were handcuffed and placed inside an NYPD bus, reported PIX11. They are facing disorderly conduct charges.

Some people continued protesting peacefully near Fifth Avenue and 37th Street.

NYPD Commissioner William Bratton had said in no uncertain terms that he would not let anyone disrupt the Thanksgiving celebration, which was attended this year by estimated 3.5million people, with 50million watching from home.

‘We will not tolerate, under any circumstances, any effort to disrupt this parade,’ Bratton said Thursday morning. ‘This is a national event, a historic event. Anybody who would seek to interrupt it would be callous, indeed, on this very special day.’

Twitter user Gabrini Leblanc wrote at the conclusion of the parade: '#stoptheparade was a success, even if the parade itself wasn't shut down. People are seeing the truth, and stopping to think. ‘

Children and adults alike flocked to the parade route to take in the balloons, floats and performers 

The hashtag #StopTheParade set social media on fire on Wednesday night, after thousands took over the streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn on Tuesday in response to the conclusion of the Ferguson case. 

Those protests - in which 10 of an estimated 3,000 were arrested - had inspired a plan to use the spotlight surrounding the parade to push what they say is injustice.

A notice posted to Facebook read: 'We do not accept state violence or genocide as cause for celebration. When the masses gather for the Thanksgiving Day Parade, we will gather to remind the public that BLACK LIVES MATTER.

'We will meet on the steps of the Public Library bright and early to plan exact flash mob location and make our signs. Please bring cardboard/posterboard small enough to hide on your person and markers.' 

Drumming up support: This post was circulating Facebook Wednesday night, urging people to join a flash mob that will hit the the 88th Annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade

Time and place: The group are set to meet at the New York Public Library at 7am to plan the protest, so as not to telegraph their plans online

 #StopTheParade: Twitter was alight with people supporting the push against the Thanksgiving Day Parade

Plan: A map of the parade and of a plan of how to disrupt it was being spread on Twitter

On the eve of the parade, thousands of people marched through the streets of New York and congregated in small groups in Union Square to discuss their plans for the parade. 

'With this hands-off approach (by police), it gives (protesters) free rein to do anything they want,' a law enforcement source told The Post.

'It’s a free pass to act like a fool.'

One group marched to Times Square, with police officers on their heels keeping tabs on the situation while avoiding confrontations. 

The protesters disrupted traffic on the FDR Drive and gathered at the entrances to the Williamsburg and Manhattan bridges, as well as the Queens Midtown Tunnel.

Commissioner Bratton said that his officers were giving demonstrators 'breathing room' to air their grievances. .

'As long as they remain nonviolent, and as long as they don't engage in issues that cause fear or create vandalism, we will work with them to allow them to demonstrate,' he said.
