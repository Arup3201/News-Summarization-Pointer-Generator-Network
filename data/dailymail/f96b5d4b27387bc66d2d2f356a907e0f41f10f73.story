David Cameron’s political guru Steve Hilton is to make a shock return to Downing Street in a No 10 shake-up.

The ‘blue skies’ thinker, who left for America last year because he was disillusioned by the pace of reform in Whitehall, will advise a new policy board set up by the Prime Minister.

The board will be run by Boris Johnson’s younger brother, Tory MP Jo Johnson, who will become a Cabinet Office minister and also take charge of the No 10 policy unit in the run up to the 2015 election.

Cameron aides hailed the move as a 
return to the days of Margaret Thatcher, when the policy shop was run by
highly ideological Tories.

Until now, Mr Cameron’s policy unit has been
staffed solely by civil servants, a situation which has dismayed Tory 
MPs who think the Government has lacked drive and focus.

Lord Ashcroft, the former Tory donor, 
was among several party grandees who had been calling for Mr Cameron to 
set up an advisory board to consult his MPs.

Mr Hilton will continue to live in 
California, flying back for some meetings of the new board ‘a few times a
year’ to help develop and push through Conservative policies.

Mr Hilton was the champion of the Big Society concept and urged Mr Cameron to adopt more green policies

The Prime Minister tweeted this pictured of a meeting with some of his new advisers, including Jo Johnson (centre left)

Insiders said the aide, notorious for 
his scruffy and shoeless attire and penchant for travelling by bicycle, 
would also conduct video conferences around once a month.

Given the Johnson family’s reputation 
for being fiercely competitive, MPs saw Jo’s appointment as an effort to
neutralise the threat from his brother Boris, Mr Cameron’s most 
high-profile leadership rival.

Margaret Thatcher would be ‘appalled’ at Tories who switch to the UK Independence Party, one of her closest allies has said.

Former defence secretary Liam Fox warned that Conservatives flirting with the eurosceptic party will simply open the door to another Labour government.

He also argued that Tory politicians should remind the public of Lady Thatcher’s belief that countries shouldn’t spend more than they earn.

His outspoken address to the Midlands Industrial Council came after UKIP leader Nigel Farage claimed that if Lady Thatcher were entering politics today she would join his party.

Dr Fox said: ‘Lady Thatcher used to say that she was born a Conservative, would die a Conservative and would fight for her beliefs inside the Conservative party.

‘I think she would be disappointed, if not appalled, to see Conservatives switching to UKIP rather than argue their case inside the Conservative party.

‘But worse, she would be horrified to think that such switching could open the door to power . . . to her mortal enemy, the Labour party.’

Dr Fox spoke out as UKIP faced the embarrassing revelation that one of its local election candidates was a member of the far-right BNP and another blamed Jews for the Holocaust.

It also sparked speculation that the 
younger, less ostentatious brother could end up eclipsing his more 
established sibling, just as Ed Miliband usurped his brother to win the 
Labour leadership.

The London Mayor hailed his brother’s 
appointment, saying: ‘Great there is finally a Johnson in Number 10.

Jo 
will be superb.’ In a reference to their other siblings, he added: ‘Now 
for Rachel and Leo!’ Rachel is a journalist and novelist and Leo an 
entrepreneur.

The Mayor was then photographed 
wielding a copy of a newspaper which had carried the headline: ‘A 
Johnson finally gets into No 10.’ It had been impishly doctored to read:
‘A B. Johnson finally gets into Number 10.’ His full name is Alexander 
Boris Johnson.

Their father Stanley said: ‘I’m delighted. The odds on a Tory victory must have shortened.’

Both Jo and Boris were educated at Mr 
Cameron’s old school, Eton College, and at Balliol College, Oxford, 
where both were members of the notorious and socially exclusive 
Bullingdon Club dining society.

The creation of the new policy board 
is designed to show backbenchers that Mr Cameron is listening to their 
concerns and dispel the notion that he runs an exclusive clique in No 
10.

But the addition of a third  old 
Etonian to his inner circle will do little to help his cause.

Among 
other appointments to the board are Jesse Norman, who led the House of 
Lords reform rebellion and is also an old Etonian, and Peter Lilley, who
was in Lady Thatcher and John Major’s cabinets.

‘I told them I want more ideas to help hardworking people,’ Mr Cameron posted on Twitter after meeting the board yesterday.

The PM’s spokesman batted away 
questions over whether appointing another Eton-educated figure meant he 
was receiving a ‘narrow’ range of advice.

Mr Cameron has already sought to 
strengthen communications with restive Tory backbenchers after 
right-winger John Hayes was recruited as a ‘sounding board’ last month.

But not all Tory MPs were  convinced 
by the moves. One senior figure said: ‘I love Jo Johnson, but when will 
Dave realise it’s leadership we want, not go-betweens.’

Labour vice-chairman Michael Dugher said: ‘The country needs new policies, not a new policy team.

‘These appointments are all about 
shoring up this out-of-touch and weak Prime Minister. This looks like 
rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.’
