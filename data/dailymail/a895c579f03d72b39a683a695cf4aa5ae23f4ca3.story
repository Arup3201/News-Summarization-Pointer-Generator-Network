An artist has explored the light and dark aspects of human character by shooting real-life representations of chess pieces.

Italian portrait photographer Francesco Ridolfi's Chess Portraits fine art series sees pieces including the Queen, King and Knight bought to life.

He shot the same models in contrasting white and black outfits as a ‘set of archetypes that convey different aspects of human nature’.

Rooky: Italian photographer Mr Ridolfi has brought chess pieces to life with a series of stunning portraits

The Italian-born snapper spent nine months working on the project, carefully choosing which costumes to use

The photographer explained that he's always been very interested in chess - but he's not an expert

It took nine months to realise the project, including researching the right period costume for each of the twelve characters.

Mr Ridolfi said: ‘I have always been fascinated about Chess. When I was a child, my father taught me the rules of the game and we used to play together. That said, I'm certainly not an expert on it, but still today I love to play chess with friends. So, probably this is the roots of the whole idea.

‘The idea to humanise the different pieces of the chess board came to me probably a couple of years ago, and it took a while to grow and shape in my mind.

Mr Ridolfi was keen to explore the light and dark sides of human nature - the dualism that exists in us all

Mr Ridolfi divides his time between Italy - he was born in Bologna - and Belgium and often shoots adverts

‘To me, the most interesting part of the whole project was the possibility to portray the same character both in black and white. To highlight different and sometimes opposite parts of the human nature, that often coexist in each of us.

'Chess figures offer an opportunity to explore this dualism. As a portrait photographer, I've always been interested in these different feelings that could emerge in the subjects in front of my lens.

‘The fact that the chess game has a set of six different archetypes - the King, the Queen, the Bishop, the Rook, the Knight, the Pawn - to work with, gives me the possibility to explore different parts of human nature. And, actually, it was a great source of inspiration to play with period dresses and costumes.’
