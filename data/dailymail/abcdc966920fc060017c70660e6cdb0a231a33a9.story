Hull expect to find out on Thursday how much they will have to pay for former Blackpool winger Tom Ince.

It is understood that representatives from both clubs will attend a tribunal on Thursday to fix the level of compensation due to the Championship side.

Ince moved to the KC Stadium in July after his Blackpool contract had expired, but as he is only 22 his former club are entitled to a fee.

Tom Ince joined Hull in the summer on a free transfer after leaving Blackoop at the end of his contract

The midfielder has only made eight appearances for Hull this season, scoring one goal

Blackpool are due a compensation fee for Ince because he was only 22 when he left for nothing

Ince started City's first three Premier League games of the season but was subsequently loaned to Nottingham Forest.

The former Liverpool trainee returned to Hull and has featured a further four times including against Arsenal in the FA Cup and West Brom in the league.
