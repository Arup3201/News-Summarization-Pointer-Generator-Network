U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said America is ready to support Kofi Annan's push to find a diplomatic solution to Syria's war.

Speaking at the start of a European visit focused heavily on the Syrian bloodshed that has killed around 15,000 people, Clinton said she supported the former UN secretary general's efforts to 'prepare for a democratic transition that leads to a post-Assad Syria.'

'I've been in close consultation with special envoy Kofi Annan about the prospects for a meeting that would focus on a roadmap for political transition in Syria,' Clinton said during a visit to Helsinki.

Annan today confirmed talks between world powers would take place in Geneva on Saturday, but plans have been beset by differences between the United States and Russia on the need for political transition.

Washington, facing a domestic outcry over human rights atrocities committed by the Syrian army, has pressed for an immediate end to the violence and for President Bashar al-Assad -- never an ally of the West -- to step down.

Russia, which has ties to Syria's military and the ruling Ba'ath Party that stretch back to the Soviet era, has stressed the need for Syrians to decide their own future and has not ruled out Assad staying in power.

Clinton said she had spoken with Annan 'three times in the last 24 hours'.

He 'has developed his own very concrete roadmap for political transition, he has been circulating it for comments and when I spoke to him yesterday I conveyed our support for the plan that he has put forward'.

'We think it embodies the principles needed for any political transition in Syria that could lead to a peaceful, democratic and representative outcome reflecting the will of the Syrian people.'

Top State Department officials have previously insisted Clinton would only attend the meeting if all parties agreed on the need for political transition in Syria.

'If we can meet on the basis of that roadmap, with everyone agreeing before we arrive in Geneva that this will be the document we are endorsing by our presence, then this makes a lot of sense and we support it,' Clinton said today.

'But we want to make sure any country that participates firmly supports the envoy's transition plan and his original six point plan,' she added.

Clinton said there was 'great hope that this perhaps can be a turning point in the very tragic circumstances affecting the Syrian people'.

If an agreement were to be reached at the meeting, 'that's the first time that the international community will really evidence a direction that I think Assad will have to respond to,' she said.

'If (Annan) is able to pull off such a meeting and if he is able to get people there who up until now have either been on the sidelines or actively supporting or protecting the Assad regime, then that gives heart to the opposition. It also disheartens a lot of the regime insiders.'
