The waiting is over, the World Cup is finally here. But after 84 years, how much is really new?

What can we expect that we have not seen in some form or other in football’s greatest competition?

Here, Sportsmail lists 10 things you will - or might - see at this World Cup for the first time…

Best yet? This summer's tournament promises to be the most colourful and intriguing World Cup in history

1) Signs that the Brazilians have stopped trying

There was a time, not so long ago, that a Brazilian footballer’s name carried with it mystique and meaning. Pele, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Socrates, Zico, Garrincha – the Little Bird. Flair by name and deed.

Step forward the class of 2014, step forward Fred and, er, Bernard. There’s a chap named Victor on their bench as well. Truth be told, little Bernard is a real dazzler and is believed to be on the radars of Tottenham and Arsenal. If the name doesn’t get pulses racing, Shakhtar Donetsk’s £30m valuation might.

2) Shaving foam on the pitch

It’s
 1974, Brazil have a free-kick 25 yards from Zaire’s goal. The referee’s
 whistle blows and from the Zaire wall Mwepu Ilunga comes charging, 
kicking away the stationary ball. Forty years later, the gently 
simmering issue of encroachment might finally have been dealt with.

Referees will use vanishing spray in the World Cup for the first time 
this summer, drawing a foamy circle around the ball and a line 10 yards 
away to keep that pesky wall at bay. We are informed the spray is 
non-toxic, water-based and designed to fade from the pitch after a 
minute.

3) Big Head the turtle

There’s a turtle sanctuary north of Salvador where Big Head the loggerhead is channelling the cosmos (probably) to make predictions for each game. It’s a bit like that octopus in South Africa, but a turtle.

The 25-year-old is predicting the results by choosing one of three fish, with a fish representing each of the teams in a given fixture and a third fish representing a draw. Big Head initially appeared to back Brazil-Croatia to end in a draw, but slowly turned away and crawled purposefully, menacingly to the Brazilian fish, which he devoured.

Confident: Big Head the turtle says Brazil are going to win the World Cup

4) Goal-line technology

Soon there will be nothing to gripe about or dissect and football can be at peace. This World Cup ought to signal the end of goal-line controversies. German company GoalControl has focussed seven high-speed cameras on each goalmouth from the roofs of all 12 stadiums.

If a ball crosses the line, the referee's watch will vibrate and the word ‘GOAL’ will appear on his screen within a second. Within five seconds of this happening in an England match, TV pictures will cut away to Frank Lampard’s reaction.

No goal: Mistakes such as the one which saw Frank Lampard's goal against Germany in 2010 not awarded should be a thing of the past with goal-line technology introduced

5) England win a penalty shootout

In a world where turtles predict football results, stranger things have happened. However, the numbers actually indicate England are less likely to win a shootout in the World Cup than elsewhere, with all three of their previous attempts ending in defeat with a conversion rate of only 50 per cent (seven scored, seven missed).

If you factor in the European Championships, where England beat Spain in 1996, England have won one of six shootouts, with a 68 per cent conversion rate (21 scored, 10 missed). This time, of course, they have Steve Peters strengthening the minds and training sessions where they have kicked penalties into open nets. Cue second-round pandemonium when England knock out Colombia on penalties and Joe Hart, dandruff free, holds Peters aloft, while players mimic their inner chimps in the background.

6) An African team reaches the semi-final. Maybe

It’s never happened before, with the quarter-finals previously claiming Cameroon (1990), Senegal (2002) and Ghana in 2010. The draw has not offered any glaring opportunities to do better this time, with only Ivory Coast in Group C and Nigeria in Group F holding realistic chances of progression from the first round. Nigeria might fancy their second-round chances against the winners or runners up of a modest Group E, while Ivory Coast would take on a side from England’s group.

7) The world loves Belgium

Vincent Kompany, Thibaut Coutois, Jan Vertonghen, Daniel van Buyten, Eden Hazard etc. Belgium are no longer only the hipster’s choice. They have an easy group but will likely face either Germany or Cristiano Ronaldo in the second round.

Red alert: Belgium are the outside bet of many punters

8) A Wayne Rooney goal

Eight years after his first attempt, and four years after Nike’s ‘Write the Future’ campaign hinted he might end up in a caravan, Rooney is yet to do at a World Cup that thing strikers are meant to do. This time, with pressure and expectation at an all-time low, can he do it? Or is his move into a Lunar Quasar drawing closer?

9) The voice of reason

After England’s impressive run to the quarter-finals, the glow fades and radio debate analyses what went wrong. After some discussion on the merits of playing at least three passes in the control zone, it is quickly agreed that passion was the problem. Overpaid players don't want it enough.

Passion play: Can Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney succeed where they have failed in previous tournaments?

10) Rio in Rio

Rio Ferdinand has made enough forays into television for his transition into pundit to be nothing too out of the ordinary. However, unlike Rio’s World Cup Wind-Ups, it’s unlikely that he’ll be teaming up with the Policia Ferderal to ‘Merk Nev’. He tweeted on Thursday that he will be kicking off his World Cup by watching Brazil-Croatia at the home of Fabio and Rafael.
