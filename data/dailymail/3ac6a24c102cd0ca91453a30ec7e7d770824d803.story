From holodecks and virtual surgeons to 3d printed smart clothes and virtual sex, it seems the future is about to get a lot more hi-tech. 

Researchers were asked to imagine the technology they believe will be around in 2025, when ultra high speed 'gigabit' internet connections are commonplace.

The agree that virtual reality will be key, and say the age of the Star Trek 'holodeck' could finally arrive.

'Wearing clothes that are tailor-made for you every day, 3D-printed at home, will also become normal, with the previous day's clothes recycled efficiently, one expert claims.

The age of gigabit connectivity is dawning and will advance in coming years.

A gigabit connection can deliver 1,000 megabits of information per second (Mbps).

Globally, cloud service provider Akamai reports that the average global connection speed in quarter one of 2014 was 3.9 Mbps, with South Korea reporting the highest average connection speed, 23.6 Mbps and the US at 10.5 Mbps.

The new report from the Pew Research Center and Elon University called Killer Apps in the Gigabit Age, asked 1,464 experts what the advent of gigabit-speed internet connections will mean.

They all agree that virtual environments were likely to become key. 

'There will be full, always-on, 360-degree environmental awareness, a semantic overlay on the real world, and full-presence massive open online courses. 

'Plus Skype won't break up nearly as much,' said David Weinberger, Berkman Center for Internet & Society.

However, they believe that pornography will be among the prime uses of the technology as holodecks appear at home.

'On the entertainment front, something like the Holodeck concept first shown in the old Star Trek series is actually within our grasp by 2025,' said Kathryn Campbell, an analyst with Primitive Spark.

'Games, films, shopping for cars and vacations, and (of course) porn will all become immersive 3D experiences.' 

However, rather than the current vitual worlds, experts say that holograms could finally become a reality. 

'No doubt the killer app will be real-life holograms operating in real time: for instance, as doctors, as surgeons, as coworkers,' Futurist Marcel Bullinga said. 

He believes it could mean the end of having to go to the office. 

'Sensors everywhere—on property, on our clothes, on (and perhaps in) our bodies, all of it feeding digital information to be processed on servers or filtered and passed to the cloud. 

'By 2025 small devices might be powered by harvested energy, in which case the possibilities expand dramatically. 

'On the receiving end of this massive information flow will be large displays at work and in many homes through which vast quantities of information can be rapidly visualized. 

'We have lagged in exploiting this because it is more difficult to model or demo than a simple application, but it will come.'

Jonathan Grudin, Microsoft Research 

'It will change the workplace. Not only will it diminish the need for business travel, it will also increase competition in the labor market immensely. 

'Whereas before you had to compete with fellow humans in the same physical area, immigrants for example, in the future you have to compete with 'cloud immigrants'—coworkers appearing in their work as a hologram.'

Schoolchildren are also likely to spend far less time in the classroom, it was predicted. 

'The school day will disaggregate into a number of learning sessions, some at home, some in the neighborhood, some in pairs, some in larger groups, with different kinds of facilitators.' JP Rangaswami of Salesforce.com said.

He also believes that advances in technology will lead to a massive change in how we shop - with a new outfit being printed every day, and recycled once it has been worn.

'Wearing clothes that are tailor-made for you every day, 3D-printed at home, will also become normal, with the previous day's clothes recycled efficiently' said Rangaswami 

'Entertainment appliances, environmental control systems, and security alarm systems will all benefit from third-party service providers managing these systems on our behalf. 

'Smart cities will amass substantial information in real time to deal with traffic, power generation, and distribution. 

'High-speed connectivity means streaming will be replaced by download/playback except for real-time events. Group interaction and perhaps 3D video will become a reality. 

'Already we see a lot of the former in Google’s Hangouts. 

'3D printing will lead to completely new supply chains including for raw materials. 

'Designs will be transferred on the Net and devices created at the end points with 3D printing and manual or automatic assembly.”

Vint Cerf, vice president and chief Internet evangelist for Google 

The report also says that our diets will change dramatically, as will the way we monitor our health.

'The next big food fad, after hipster locavores, will be individualized scientific diets, based on the theory that each person's unique genetics, locations, and activities mean that she requires a specific diet, specially formulated each day.'Judith Donath, Berkman Center for Internet and Society claimed.

Hal Varian, Google's chief economist, says that our health will also improve thanks to more monitoring.

Experts all agree that virtual environments were likely to become key in the future

'The big story here is continuous health monitoring... It will be much cheaper and more convenient to have that monitoring take place outside the hospital. 

'You will be able to purchase health-monitoring systems just like you purchase home-security systems. 

'Indeed, the home-security system will include health monitoring as a matter of course. Robotic and remote surgery will become commonplace.'
