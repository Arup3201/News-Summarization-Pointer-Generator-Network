Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher slammed Kevin Mirallas after the Everton midfielder refused to let Leighton Baines take a penalty against West Brom, only for the Belgian to then miss.

Baines, Everton's regular penalty-taker, tried to convince Mirallas to surrender the ball after Roberto Marinez's side were awarded a spot kick minutes before half time during the 0-0 draw at Goodison Park on Monday night.

But Mirallas ignored Baines and team-mates Romelu Lukaku and Steven Naismith, who both tried to reason with the Belgian, before firing his effort from 12 yards wide via the base of the left-hand post.

Gary Neville described Mirallas' decision to take the penalty as a 'despicable breach of team orders'

It proved to be Mirallas' last impact on the game as he was hooked at half-time, replaced by Bryan Oviedo, and pundit Neville was heavily critical of the winger.

'It was a despicable breach of team orders,' Neville said on Sky Sports during halftime. 'Letting your team-mates down. It was a selfish act on the pitch by taking things off a specialist. 

'At 0-0 in such a crucial match, it's unacceptable. Free-kick and penalty-takers are usually listed and discussed in a team meeting.'

Sportsmail columnist Carragher described Mirrallas' decision to take the penalty ahead of Baines as shocking and questioned why the club's senior players didn't intervene.

Baines then slapped Mirallas across the face to offer some encouragement ahead of the spot kick

Jamie Carragher said Everton's senior players should have intervened and told Mirallas to let Baines take it

‘Where are your senior players and why aren't they getting involved?' Carragher said.

'Gareth Barry walking back, Roberto Martinez talking to John Stones. In the back four you naturally would think Leighton Baines would be taking it.

'It doesn't matter how well you're playing, you don't take the penalty off the penalty-taker. It was a shocking decision. There's no bigger chance than a penalty.

'It's like kids football. Whoever got the ball first took the penalty. Kids fighting over the ball.' 

Baines' penalty record in the Premier League is brilliant - he has netted 15 of his 16 spot kicks - yet Mirallas was determined to take the set piece.

And that is despite the Belgian not having scored from the spot since March 2012.

Gary Neville, while on commentary for Sky Sports, was fairly scathing in his analysis of the incident.

He said: 'If he's gone against team orders it's despicable, but we have to wait until then.'

Interestingly, Craig Bellamy took a penalty against team orders while playing for Liverpool against Birmingham City and was fined by then-manager Rafael Benitez as a result.

Bellamy missed the penalty during Liverpool's last-16 League Cup victory over Birmingham in November 2006.
