A mother told the High Court yesterday that ‘miracles do happen’ as she pleaded for the life of her critically ill baby son.

The boy, who was left severely brain damaged after a traumatic premature birth by Caesarean section, has spent his short life on a ventilator in an intensive care unit.

The NHS Trust in the case is carrying out what the health service calls a ‘serious untoward incident’ investigation after accepting that something had ‘gone wrong’.

Now doctors at the hospital involved say there is nothing more they can do for the child and it is in his best interests to have his life-support machines switched off – against the wishes of his parents who believe he can recover.

Today, a High Court judge will rule on the case of the one-year-old boy who cannot be named or otherwise identified for legal reasons.

But in an impassioned appeal to the Family Division of the High Court yesterday, the child’s mother, who cannot be named, said she refused to believe the NHS or the courts should have the right to end her baby’s life.

‘At the end of the day he is still alive,’ she said. ‘The ventilator is helping and supporting that life.

‘Where there is life I don’t think you should get the right to determine whether that should be taken away. We believe that [he] does respond to us … We don’t feel that the Trust has the right to end his life because he has got brain damage.’

She added that she felt her son might one day recover to the point where he could experience ‘pleasures of life’, adding: ‘He is still alive. Miracles do happen.’

The boy’s father, also unnamed, told the court his son could sense the environment around him and added that no one should be allowed to ‘take the privilege of life from him’.

In words that echoed those of the parents of five-year-old cancer victim Ashya King, whose family fled the UK after disagreements with the NHS over his treatment, the baby’s father said they had been made to feel ‘our child is not our child any more’ by doctors who gave ‘no consideration’ to their feelings.

He said: ‘Even though [my son] is going through all these problems, he still knows … what is going on … He knows, he acknowledges certain things that are going around him. As parents, we want him to be alive. That is our desire. We want him to be comfortable.

‘I spend a lot of time with him, talking to him. I know when he is listening … We know he is reacting to certain things. He still has life.’

He said he believed as time went on his son would ‘develop much better’, adding: ‘We have told these doctors several times of the improvements that he is making and they have always refused to listen to what we have to say … We have been told that this child is not even our child any more. I just cannot believe they can come out with some of these things.’

Ms Justice Alison Russell will today decide whether the child should have ‘life-sustaining care’ withdrawn. 

Claire Watson, representing the unnamed NHS trust, told the court yesterday that the boy was born prematurely by emergency Caesarean section in ‘poor condition’ and had suffered ‘profound irreversible brain damage’.

But she admitted that there had been problems with the care the child received and told the judge: ‘The trust have endeavoured to be entirely transparent about what has gone wrong.’

Miss Watson added that the baby cannot breathe without a ventilator and that since his birth his condition had not improved despite ‘ongoing intensive care’.

She said that as a result specialists recommended that removing his life-support was in the boy’s best interests.
