A restaurant has unveiled the largest chilli cheese hotdog in Europe with 13,000 calories - that's six times a woman's recommended daily intake.

At over one metre-long and filled with 1.5kgs of beef sausage, a whole pound of homemade chilli and lashings of cheese, the Monster Dog at Smokey’s Joint in Walsall, near Birmingham, contains an estimated 13,000 calories.

It is more than five times the daily recommended allowance of 2,500 calories for a man.

The gastronomic gauntlet is the latest in what the eatery hopes will be a long line of food challenges and follows the creation of the 3lb cheeseburger, which has yet to be successfully tackled by any contender.

Dean Key, 30, director of Smokey’s, said he began seeking out a new challenge following his customers failed attempts to complete the Monster Burger.

He said: ‘I’ve had people asking us for weeks when it’s going to come out and if it’s ready yet.

‘We’ve spent ages developing the prototypes and we’ve had a lot of fun trying them out. The most any of the guys here have managed to eat is about half of one.

‘The real struggle was in sourcing a really big sausage and eventually we got a local butcher to supply the meat which he uses to fill extra large sausage skins ordered especially from Holland.

‘It’s pure beef sausage. We wanted to make sure the ingredients were of a really high quality because if you’re going to eat that much of something it has to taste good.’

The Monster Dog boasts a massive 1,000 grams of fat as opposed to the modest 70 grams recommended as part of woman's recommended daily intake, and 100 grams recommended for a man.

The chefs help lift up the latest challenge, which is more than a couple of handfuls, to Miss Ironside

The restaurant's latest challenge contains a whopping 34,274 mgs of salt and 523 grams of saturated fat

It also contains a whopping 34,274 mgs of salt.

With 80 people so far having attempted - and failed - to overcome the gut-busting burger, it is unlikely anyone will manage to complete a whole Monster Dog in the near future.

Dean said: ‘Both the burger and the hotdog are £29.95 or free if you eat it in an hour.

‘When we made the burger I had a load of T-shirts printed that said “I conquered the Monster Burger” and I still have all of them.

‘I wish I’d got a bunch that said, “I was defeated by the Monster Burger” because I could have sold dozens of them.’

The restaurant launched the challenges after enjoying the hit American show Man vs Food, in which presenter Adam Richman travels the US seeking out the biggest food challenges.

Dean, who runs the restaurant with business partners Jonanthan Caddick, 31, Dale Key, 27 and Stefan Hilton, 22, believes the Monster Dog is the biggest in Europe, dwarfing the competition.

However, it has a long way to go to beat the current world’s longest meat hot dog record holder, measured at 203.8 m and manufactured by Ochsi of Paraguay.
