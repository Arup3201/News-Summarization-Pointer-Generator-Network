An Oklahoma father has penned a sympathetic letter to a student who was last week caught planning a mass casualty attack on the high school that his son attends.

Police became aware of the 16-year-old student after his friends alerted school authorities about worrying texts he had sent them, with a search of his home finding explosives, blueprints of explosives and plans to carry out a mass killing at Edmond North High School.

Charles Martin's son, Michael, is a freshman at the school, which has 2,437 students.

But rather than feel anger toward the student and his plan, Mr Martin, a writer, said he felt compassionate. 

He subsequently penned a letter to the boy titled 'To The Teen Who Planned To Kill My Son'.

Sympathetic: Charles Martin wrote a letter to a 16-year-old Edmond North High School student who was caught allegedly plotting to stage a mass killing at the school where Mr Martin's son goes

'Instead of mourning, my son, his brother, and I are going to have a long, happy spring break,' Mr Martin wrote in the letter about his son, Michael (right)

Compassionate: The letter was posted to Facebook after Mr Matin's company website crashed from all the clicks it was receiving 

The letter is an attempt to understand what the teen was going through as he planned the alleged attack.

It questions whether the area's harsh winter had anything to do with it, and suggests he may have never intended to actually go through with the plan.

Mr Martin believes he may have wanted to get caught. 

'The first thought just goes back to what it’s like being a teenager,' Mr Martin told KFOR.

'It’s a brutal, brutal time.

'Even if what he was going to do was monstrous, he is a human being.

'I hope he can find his way back to something even close to normal, that he can just survive this hole that he’s in and find something better on the other side.' 

Writer: Charles Martin said the first thing he thought about after hearing of the alleged plot was how 'brutal' it is to be a teenager

Scene: The 16-year-old allegedly planned to set off explosives at Edmond North High School in Oklahoma

The student is now being treated at an in-patient treatment facility.

He has not been charged, but may get convicted on possession of explosives charges.

He will not be returning the school. 

Mr Martin owns a small publishing company, and posted the letter to his website, Literati Press.

It quickly went viral, causing the site to crash.

He then posted it to Facebook, where it continues to circulate.
