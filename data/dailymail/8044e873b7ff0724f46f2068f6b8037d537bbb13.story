The grandmother of Heather Mack’s newly-born daughter has been having ‘intense discussions’ with the teenager about the future of the baby girl who is destined to spend the first two years of her life behind bars in Bali

Ms Kia Walker has flown from her home near Chicago to stay in the hospital where 19-year-old Miss Mack has given birth to the daughter, whom she has named Stella Schaefer, after her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer.

Ms Walker, Mr Schaefer’s mother, is understood to be concerned that the baby girl will remain with Miss Mack in Kerobokan Prison when a court verdict is delivered in the next few weeks.

Miss Mack and Schaefer have been accused of the premeditated murder of Miss Mack’s socialite mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack and if they are found guilty they will face many years behind bars - or even the death penalty by firing squad.

In a desperate attempt to come to an arrangement for her granddaughter’s immediate future, it is understood Ms Walker has been talking in detail to Miss Mack about her intended plans to keep the baby with her in Kerobokan prison for the full two years that babies are allowed to remain there with their mothers.

‘The discussions have been pretty intense,’ said a hospital source. ‘There has been a lot of pressure on Heather to think again about keeping a baby in a prison cell for the first years of her life.’

It has not been revealed whether Ms Walker has offered to look after her grandchild - or whether the same offer has been made from Miss Mack’s relatives.

'There is no doubt she is concerned about the welfare of the baby,' said the source.

While Miss Mack recovers from the caesarian delivery in Bali’s Sanglah Hospital on Wednesday, Mr Schaefer’s mother has been seen through a hospital window talking to her at length.

Ms Walker has also been observed standing on a hospital balcony, smoking cigarettes.

While she has not spoken publicly about her son’s murder case - nor about the birth of his baby - she revealed on social media in October that a plea for donations to help pay for her son’s legal fees had reached $10,600.

She said she had been advised not to comment publicly on the murder case in which her son has been accused of battering Mrs Wiese-Mack to death and stuffing her body in a suitcase, with the help of his girlfriend Heather.

‘I spent the weekend practicing self-care,’ she wrote at the time, adding: ‘I’ve accomplished a great deal by staying home and being surrounded by my friends and chosen family.’

But now she is in Bali - and at the bedside of Heather Mack while her son paces up and down his cell in Kerobokan prison, reportedly frustrated because he has been unable to set eyes on his baby daughter.

The accused couple are scheduled to appear in court again next week but legal sources suggested the case might be adjourned to allow Miss Mack more time to recover from the birth.
