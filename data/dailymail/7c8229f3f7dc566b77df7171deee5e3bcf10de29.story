A man has died after crashing into a post while strapped to a board in a new craze known as 'land surfing'.

The 26-year-old  and two friends were skating with their feet secured to a surfboard on wheels when the accident happened.

He suffered life-threatening head injuries after hitting a post in the car park of the D-Day Museum in Southsea, Hampshire. He had not been wearing a helmet.

The man, who is believed to be from Lithuania, was taken by air ambulance to the neurological unit at Southampton General Hospital.

Hampshire Constabulary informed his next of kin of the accident, which happened on Sunday evening.

He was placed on life support in a critical condition with his family at his bedside and died in the early hours today.

Now calls are being made for people taking part in the sport to wear proper safety equipment.

David Evans, the seafront manager for Portsmouth City Council, said: 'The thing about longboards is they tend to have straps on.

'People will take risks, but they should find a place to do it safely and wear the proper equipment.

'Even in the skate park they must wear helmets and knee and elbow pads.

'It's like climbing rocks without ropes on. His parents must be devastated.'

Mr Evans said land surfing was not allowed on the museum's private car park area.

He added: 'Land surfing is relatively new and there are no by-laws against that particular activity.

'The carpark is not the highway - it's private land so it wouldn't be permitted.

'We would ask our community wardens to talk to people they see doing it, not least because they can get injured and bystanders can be injured.

'Any activity of this type is dangerous and users can be involved in a serious accident as has sadly happened in this case.'

David Walker, leisure safety manager for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said land surfing can be dangerous.

He said: 'We would recommend that those participating in skateboarding and land surfing take the opportunity to learn from those with more experience.

'They should approach it in a similar way as they would to other adventurous activities.

'Joining a club and practising runs within their limits, while still learning the basics, are the key ways to avoid injury and improve quickly.

'Finding an appropriate location to take part and choosing the right safety kit, including a helmet and wrist guards - particularly if you are beginner - is also advised.'
