A medical marijuana activist from Florida is accusing Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of attempted bribery after the congresswoman allegedly offered to back legalization if the man stopped criticizing her in public.

At stake for Wasserman Schultz is the possibility of a Senate bid. If Florida's junior senator, Marco Rubio, runs for the presidency as expected, he has said he won't seek reelection to Congress - leaving the seat open for the taking.

Politico first reported on the allegations, brought by Democratic donor and Orlando, Florida, trial lawyer John Morgan. 

The Florida congresswoman, who also heads the national Democratic Party, has since disputed the charges, calling them 'outrageous.'

LIES: Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz says is not true, and frankly 'outrageous' that she offered to support a ballot initiative in her state that would legalize medical marijuana if one of her critics piped down as she mulls a Senate campaign

The brouhaha goes back to last year, when Wasserman Schultz refused to support a ballot initiative that would have legalized medical marijuana in her state. It fell just short of the 60 percent approval rate it needed to become law in November's midterm election.

Ahead of the election, Wasserman Schultz made it clear she did not support decriminalization and tried to rally other Democrats in her state to do the same.

According to Politico, the fight was personal for Morgan, who devoted $4 million of his own money to initiative, and he's continued to hold the loss against fellow Democrat Wasserman Schultz.

With rumors afoot that she planned to seek a promotion, Morgan and other medical marijuana supporters began badmouthing her again. 

That's when Wasserman Schultz's political adviser, Jason O’Malley, allegedly contacted the former campaign manager for Morgan's ballot initiative, Ben Pollara, and offered the activist a quid pro qou.

If Morgan stopped beating up the congresswoman, she would back medical marijuana, O’Malley is said to have told Pollara.

In an email provided to Politico by Morgan that had the subject line 'DWS,' Pollara told his former client that Wasserman Schultz is now 'saying she might be willing to support new amendment.'

'Any chance you’ll retract your statement' Pollara asked.

'No,' Morgan told him. 'She is a bully. I beat bullies up for a living.' 

He then told Politico: 'Actions have consequences...Her days of pushing people around are over.'  

On Friday she told the Florida-based Sun Sentinel that Morgan's assertions were false.

'I wouldn't change my position in exchange for support under any circumstances — ever,' she told her home state publication. 'I'm always very proud to stand in front of my constituents and explain when I have a difference of opinion with them.'

President Barack Obama greets Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, also the chair of the Democratic National Committee before speaking at the DNC's winter meeting in Washington on Friday. The congresswoman appeared to be high spirits despite the public spat taking place between her office and the medical marijuana activists

What really happened, she said, is that her team approached Morgan and other medical marijuana backers after the suggested in an interview with Politico that they'd be open to discussing the issue with her.  

'I've seen the language that they've proposed for the 2016 ballot,' Wasserman Schultz told the Sun Sentinel. 'I was more comfortable with the way the language was going…. I wanted to see if, before battle lines were drawn again, we could start a conversation.'

That's not how Morgan sees it. 

'What Debbie leaves out in her pushback was the crystal clear message that her potential support of the new amendment was predicated upon me withdrawing my comments to Politico,' he told the Sun Sentinel. 'I don't know how to view that as anything but an offer of a quid pro quo.' 

And he reportedly has the text messages to prove it, including one from Pollara to O'Malley in which the go-between said, 'Tried. Failed.' - to which O'Malley replied 'thanks.'

A spokesman for Wasserman Schutlz told Politico that Pollara just had 'an unfortunate misunderstanding' of his conversation with the congresswoman's political adviser, an no deal was offered.

Morgan says that's absurd. 

'What on earth did he think "Tried. Failed" mean?” he told Politico as part of a follow up article that was published on Friday.

Neither Wasserman Schultz's political adviser O'Malley or Pollara would offer direct comment on the incident to Politico, which unfolded as the DNC held its winter meeting in Washington, D.C., but Pollara didn't dispute the publication's reporting.

And in a message to O'Malley after the original Politico article ran he allegedly said: 'Dude. I know it wasn’t your call but I told you no good come from me reaching out to morgan yesterday. I’m sorry man. You guys need to fire your press person though.'
