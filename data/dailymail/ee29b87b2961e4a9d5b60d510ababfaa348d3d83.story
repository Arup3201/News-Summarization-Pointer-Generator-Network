It is an assessment many might agree with – but had probably  never expected to hear from the woman herself.

Sally Bercow has confessed that she  is ‘deeply unsuited to being the  Speaker’s wife’.

She also claimed that she wants to return to a life of anonymity away from the Houses of Parliament, where she lives in an  ornate grace-and-favour apartment with her MP husband John, saying: ‘I’m infamous and I hate it.’

'I was a bit tipsy': Speaker's wife Sally Bercow, pictured leaving a champagne-fuelled party, has confessed that she is 'deeply unsuited to being the Speaker's wife' 

Before disappearing from the 
public eye, however, the publicity shy Mrs Bercow used a double-page 
interview in a Sunday newspaper to get a few things off her chest.

She
 said she was forced to drink to help her survive ‘an awful lot of 
boring parties’ she and Mr Bercow attend with people who had ‘their 
heads up their arses’.

And she admitted that her husband  might never
 have married her if he had known he was going to have such a 
high-profile Westminster role because ‘he’d have seen trouble ahead’.

With
 a touch of melodrama,  she added: ‘But what should I do? Divorce the 
man I love? Spend my life avoiding cameras, which I can’t because 
everyone has one on their phone?’

The mother of three, who in 2011 
posed in nothing but a bedsheet against the backdrop of the Houses of 
Parliament for a magazine photo-shoot, said she did not want to be ‘out 
there any more’.

Unsuited: Sally Bercow thinks she is the wrong type of person to be married to a high profile politician

She said: ‘Truthfully, I hate publicity. I can’t 
wait till John’s job is finished so we can move  out of that stuffy 
grace-and- favour apartment.

‘It’s like living in a goldfish bowl. 
But it’s part of John’s contract that he lives there so we’re probably 
there for another five years – then I’ll be free.’

The 43-year-old 
insisted that ‘I just want to go back to being anonymous’, but in her 
next breath hinted that it might not be happening any time soon.

She said defiantly: ‘Politics is full of pompous snobs and they would like to put me back in my box. But I won’t go.’

Sally Bercow says that she has appeared on television shows such as Celebrity Big Brother and ITV's Big Star Little Star only to help charities for autism, which her nine-year-old son Oliver suffers from

Unlikely friendship: Sally Bercow with her friend and Big Brother co-star Paddy Doherty. Mrs Bercow has said she 'hates' publicity and can not wait until her husband is no longer Speaker

Two
 weeks ago, Mrs Bercow put on an unexpected show for paparazzi when she 
danced in the street as she emerged from a champagne-fuelled party.

Flashing
 her underwear as  she clambered into a taxi, she grabbed a friend’s 
leg and provocatively placed it over hers,  and made a rude gesture with
 her middle finger.

Defending her raucous behaviour, she said a photographer had goaded her to ‘give us the money shot Sally’.

She
 said: ‘Yes, I was a bit tipsy. But I didn’t vomit in the street, I 
wasn’t rude to anyone. I didn’t do anything any other mum wouldn’t do on
 a night out. To hell with what people think.’

She said she was 
always careful about how much alcohol she drank because she was acutely 
aware that she had had a drink problem during her twenties.

Sally Bercow agreed to take part in Celebrity Big Brother in 2011, she said her husband John Bercow MP did not want her to go on the show

‘Yes, I 
like a few drinks, but I’m very strict about how much,’ she said. ‘I 
only started to drink again last year after ten years off it.

‘I 
drank every day, sometimes up to two bottles of wine, and I was out of 
control. I did go to a couple of AA meetings but hated all the group 
sharing stuff so I did it on my own. I needed to prove to myself that I 
could. I don’t drink every day but I know I’m an addictive person so I 
have to watch it.

‘I’ve got three kids and there’s no way I’ll ever be alcohol dependent again.

‘But
 John and I have to go to  an awful lot of boring parties  where there 
are lots of people  with their heads up their arses. So a few glasses of
 wine do make it all more tolerable.’

Mrs Bercow said she was aware of being in the public eye but felt unable to avoid bad press without changing her personality.

‘Do
 I wish I could change  that? Yes. Do I think I can? No. Because the 
only way I could is to become someone totally different,’ she said. ‘I 
don’t want that and neither does John.’

She claimed she had appeared 
on television shows such as Celebrity Big Brother and ITV’s Big Star 
Little Star only to help charities for autism, which her nine-year-old 
son Oliver suffers from.

She added: ‘How is a politician’s wife meant
 to behave? Do people expect me to wear pretty dresses, have no opinions
 and walk ten paces behind my husband? Well b******s to that.’

During
 the frank interview with the Sunday Mirror, she also spoke about the 
stress of being sued by Lord McAlpine for libel after she wrongly linked
 him to child abuse claims on Twitter.

Last week, she agreed to pay 
£15,000 in damages, which will be donated to the Chelsea Pensioners. She
 said: ‘There hasn’t been a day it wasn’t there, tormenting me. I’ve put
 on a stone just comfort eating because I was terrified.’
