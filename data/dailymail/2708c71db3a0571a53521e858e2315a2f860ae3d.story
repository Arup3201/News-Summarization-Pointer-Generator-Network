Vice-president Joe Biden has controversially told an audience made up of several hundred black supporters that Mitt Romney would put them 'back in chains' with his Wall Street financial deregulation plans.

The potentially inflammatory comments were made to an audience of 800 at the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research in Danville, Virginia, where the majority of people are African American.

'Romney wants to, he said in the first 100 days, he’s gonna let the big banks again write their own rules, unchain Wall Street,' said Mr .Biden, who then lowered his voice and added, 'They are going to put y'all back in chains.'

Asked about the comments on MSNBC, President Obama's deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter said Mr.Obama 'probably agrees with Joe Biden's sentiments.

'I mean he's using a metaphor...He was making a point that if we repeal Wall Street reform which is what Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to do, we're going to go back to the days where they're writing their own rules, and we saw what happened.

'Taxpayers had to bail them out.

'We had to spend billions of dollars of taxpayer dollars bailing them out.

'Now I would think that that, you know, that is a problem for middle class taxpayers.

'That would hamper their ability to take care of their own finances.'

Following Joe Biden's comments to the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research in Danville, Virginia, Republican commentators have called upon President Obama to apologise for his deputy

However, Mitt Romney's spokesperson Andrea Saul hit back, claiming that the Obama campaign had hit the gutter.

'In case anyone was wondering just how low President Obama could go in his campaign for re-election, we now know he's willing to say that Governor Romney wants to put people in chains,' said Saul.

Democrats rushed to defence of Mr. Biden claiming that his metaphor was taken out of context and that he was talking in purely financial terms

'Whether its accusing Mitt Romney of 
being a felon, having been responsible for a woman's tragic death or now
 wanting to put people in chains, there's no question that because of 
the President's failed record he's been reduced to a desperate campaign 
based on division and demonisation.'

As the controversy over Mr. Biden's comments grew, Saul called on the President to distance himself from his deputies comments.

'After weeks of slanderous and baseless accusations leveled against Governor Romney, the Obama Campaign has reached a new low,' press secretary Andrea Saul said in a statement.

'The comments made by the Vice President of the United States are not acceptable in our political discourse and demonstrate yet again that the Obama Campaign will say and do anything to win this election. 

'President Obama should tell the American people whether he agrees with Joe Biden’s comments.'

Rush Limbaugh also waded into the controversy.

'They’re going to put y’all back in chains, he says to a 
predominantly black audience. They’re going to put y’all back in chains.
 And, of course, the reaction, ‘Oh that’s just Joe. That’s just Joe,' said the right-wing radio host.

'He
 sees a guy in a wheelchair, ‘Stand up Chuck! Oh God bless you, what 
have I done. Everybody stand up for Chuck.’

'He’s a walking buffoon and 
Obama knows it. They all know it. But it’s getting to the point it’s too
 late to do anything about it. … Is Obama going to be in chains? That’s a
 good question. Good question. Is Ryan going to put chains back on 
Obama?'

Republican's such as Ari Fleischer, George W. Bush's press secretary took to Twitter to denounce the comments.

'The press pounded (Sarah) Palin when she talked about 'blood libel'..,what will they do about Biden's 'chains' remark.'

And as an interesting conclusion to his speech, Mr.Biden appeared to forget where he was.

He thanked those who had come to hear him speak and told them that with their help they 'can win North Carolina again.'

Biden had seemed to forget that he was speaking in Virginia.

Mr Cowen's mother is alive; his father had died.

J-O-B-S, jobs.'September 2008: During a political rally in Missouri, he urged wheelchair-bound state senator Chuck Graham to rise and be recognised, saying: 'Stand up, Chuck, let 'em see ya.' Realizing his mistake, he said: ‘Oh, God love you… what am I talking about?’September 2008: After he was named the vice presidential nominee, he addressed a crowd in Nashua, New Hampshire, questioning how he beat out Hillary Clinton: 'Hillary Clinton is as qualified or more qualified than I am to be vice president of the United States of America,' he said in New Hampshire.

A man who will be the next President of the United States - Barack America!'

Mitt Romney's campaign is blocking reporters from covering GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan's first meeting with donors in Las Vegas.

Tuesday night's event at The Venetian hotel is expected to draw casino owner and Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson.

The decision to block access marks a break from rules previously established by Romney's campaign.

Reporters usually are allowed to cover President Barack Obama's fundraisers when they are held in public venues.

A Romney aide who was not authorized to speak for the record said the event is closed to the media because it is a 'finance meeting' instead of a fundraiser. The aide said fewer than 40 people were expected to attend.

Ryan attended two Denver-area fundraisers on Monday night where media coverage also was prohibited.
