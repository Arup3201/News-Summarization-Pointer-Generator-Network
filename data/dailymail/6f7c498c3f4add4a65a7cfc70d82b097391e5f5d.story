Murderer: Marc Dutroux, seen being escorted by police officers at Brussels' Palace of Justice, is seeking early release from prison (pictured in court on February 4)

Serial paedophile child killer Marc Dutroux has been denied early release from prison amid fears he will re-offend.

A Belgian court today turned down a request by the 56-year-old to serve out the rest of his life sentence at home under electronic surveillance.

It came after Dutroux's mother warned that her son will kill again if a court grants his appeal for early release from prison.

The court then said there were 'no grounds' 
for an early release, citing the 'absence of any prospect that Dutroux' 
could be reintegrated into society.

Jeannine Dutroux, 78, described her son as a 'repeat offender in his soul' and begged judges to keep him behind bars.

The 56-year-old psychopath was arrested in 1996 and jailed for life in June 2004 for the kidnap, rape and torture of six young girls in the mid-1990s, four of whom died.

But he has now applied for early 
release under Belgian laws which state prisoners can be freed after 
serving 15 years of a life sentence if they are no longer a risk.

But
 his mother Jeannine has told Belgium's Le Soir newspaper: 'I am certain
 he will start again. Marc isn't ready to be released because he still 
wants to attribute to others the responsibility for what he did.

'This is a repeat offender in his soul, as he has already proved throughout his life.'

Dutroux
 insists he is no longer a danger to the public and it is his 'human 
right' to live at home wearing an electronic bracelet.

Judges
 will consider his application in private at Belgium's sentencing court 
in the capital Brussels at 2pm today - two months before he becomes 
eligible for release in April.

The
 demand comes after Dutroux's hated ex-wife Michelle Martin was freed 
from prison earlier this year to spend the next ten years 'at prayer' in
 a convent.

Martin, 52, had 
served 16 years of 30-year jail term for complicty in the imprisonment 
and murder of her husband's young victims.

Dutroux's bid for freedom is opposed 
by Belgian prosecutors, the victims' families and the governor of the 
high security Nivelles prison, where the killer is currently held in 
solitary confinement.

Belgium's
 Sudpresse newspaper said: 'According to the law, the sentencing court 
must take into account the views of the prosecutors, the prison and the
 victims' families.

'But it is not bound to follow their pleas to keep him locked up and can free him if it deems fit.

Abducted: Laetitia Delhez, left, was was found alive two days after going missing in 1996, aged 14, along with severely emaciated Sabine Dardenne, then 12, right, in the basement of his house the Charleroi suburb of Marcinelle

'In that case, he would be freed to be electronically tagged and live at home under house arrest.'

The Dutroux affair erupted in August 1996, when police arrested the unemployed electrician following the abduction of 14-year-old girl Laetitia Delhez.

She was found alive two days later along with severely emaciated Sabine Dardenne, 12, in the basement of his house the Charleroi suburb of Marcinelle.

In August, 1998, the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo were found buried in the garden of Dutroux's other home in the southern town of Sars La Buissiere.

A month later, the bodies of Ann Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks were found in another property owned by Dutroux.

Public anger increased when came to light that police had missed a string of clues that could have led to Dutroux being apprehended earlier.

It also emerged that he had been released from jail in 1992 after serving just three years of a 13-year sentence for the abduction and rape of five girls.

Nationwide fury boiled over and more than 300,000 people took to the streets of Brussels in October 1996 in a series of marches to protest at judicial incompetence.

Jean-Denis Lejeune, the father of victim Julie Lejeune, spoke of his 'outrage' at the release of Michelle Martin this year.

But he has now said on his Facebook page that he 'will not react' to the possible release of Dutroux.

He wrote: 'I have definitively turned the page on the whole Dutroux affair and I will not be reacting any further on this subject.

'I want instead to convert this energy into a positive force to use for the good of others, for political projects in Belgium and humanitarian work abroad.'
