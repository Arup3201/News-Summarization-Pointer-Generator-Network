Its 970 acres offer you breathtaking island views, unspoilt sandy beaches and the chance to watch otters, golden eagles and red deer.

If you fancy the self-sufficient lifestyle, Wiay off the north-west coast of Scotland also boasts an endless supply of lobster, scallops and grouse.

The private island has just gone on sale for £500,000 – less than you’d pay for a family home with a tiny patch of garden in London and many parts of the South.

The island of Wiay: It has been uninhabited since the Second World War

Famous visitor: Hercules with owner Maggie Robin

Before you decide to leave the chaos, 
expense and pollution of city life behind, however, a word of caution: 
Although it looks idyllic in this picture, Scotland’s north-west coast 
is the windiest part of Britain, and it suffers more than its fair share
 of rain – up to 250 days a year.

Wiay (pronounced ‘wee-a’) used to be 
home to a crofting family with ten children, but has been uninhabited 
since the Second World War.

Half a mile south-east of Benbecula, it has 
to be accessed by private boat from nearby Petersport.

The island is currently owned by Sarah
 Chettle, a mother of five from Dorset, who bought it for about £20,000 
in 1980 after she and her late husband, Robert, spotted a small advert 
in a newspaper.

She said: ‘It just seemed such an opportunity to have our own island. It was a bit of a romantic whim.’

As far as she can recall, they did not
 even visit the island before buying it.

The hideout used by Bonnie Prince Charlie following the Battle of Culloden in 1745 was put up for sale earlier this month

The 970-acre island also has sporting rights, and in recent years the land has been used for woodcock and duck shooting. There is also red deer stalking and fishing

Mrs Chettle, 57, compared 
owning the island to having ‘your own wildlife reserve’, adding that 
deer often swim over from nearby islands.

Wiay, which has views to neighbouring North and South Uist, has two claims to fame.

The fugitive Bonnie Prince Charlie is 
said to have hidden in a cave there for a few days after the disastrous 
Battle of Culloden in 1746.

The cave, known as Prince Charlie’s 
Rest, is on the east side of the island, which is mostly covered in 
heather with a number of small freshwater lochs.

More recently, the island was briefly 
home to Hercules, the tame grizzly bear which ran away while being 
filmed for a TV advertisement for Kleenex tissues.

In August 1980 Hercules, who was an 
impressive 8ft 4in, escaped while swimming, triggering a three-week hunt
 which became a worldwide media sensation.

Wiay from the air. The island has been uninhabited for over a century, although the current owners - the Chettle family from England, who bought it in 2003 - used it for holidays and summer camping

Bonnie Prince Charlie eventually sought shelter in this cave on Wiay, now known as 'Prince Charlie's Rest', while his followers kept watch for the British navy

The prince eventually obtained passage to France and escaped, pledging to his remaining followers that he would return with an army

After a long and fruitless search, the
 first clue was found on Wiay when his collar and his pawprints were 
spotted there. He was eventually rescued on North Uist and reunited with
 owner Maggie Robin.

Yesterday Archie Leslie-Melville, an 
associate at Bell Ingram, the estate agency selling the island, said it 
has already attracted one viewer keen to return for a second look.

But there are some significant hurdles
 for anybody keen to get away from it all and live the ‘Good Life’ 
dream.

There is no house on the island, except the ruins of an old stone
 cottage, although it does have planning permission to be turned into a 
small three-bedroom home.

The planning rules dictate that it can
 be used only as a holiday home, although it is not clear who will 
enforce this rule if the new owner decides to move permanently to the 
island.

It currently has neither running water
 nor electricity, although Mr Leslie-Melville said both problems could 
be fixed by a wind turbine, solar panels or a generator, and water pipes
 from the fresh water lochs.

He said: ‘You could live on the island very happily and be self-sufficient.’

It is likely to have its own salmon and sea trout fishing rights, although these are currently being negotiated.

For her part, Mrs Chettle admits that 
she and her children rarely visit the island, which is why she has 
decided to put it on the market, although she feels in two minds about 
the decision. ‘I don’t really mind if it does not sell,’ she said.
