Tourists and car enthusiasts have been flocking to one of London's wealthiest districts to catch a closer glimpse of some of the world's most extravagant super cars.

A fleet of luxury cars were spotted jamming the street of Cannes, in southern France, earlier this week - now dozens more have descended on Knightsbridge and Kensington.

Many of the impressive vehicles are owned by mega-rich Arabs and wealthy playboys, from the likes of Dubai and Kuwait, who have their expensive cars delivered to west London where many 
spend their summer holidays.

Some residents have complained that the drivers are behaving in an anti-social manner, by allegedly treating the area as their personal racetrack - but lots of tourists and children seem impressed with the models

Despite residents dreading 'The Season', there is one group of people salivating at the supercars and leaping to the defence of the drivers - the so-called Carparazzi

Impressed by-passers stop to take photos of a Ferrari parked in 
Knightbridge. The cars have been spotted just one day after a series of 
luxury vehicles were seen around the streets of Cannes, southern France

The vehicles - which act as a magnet for curious tourists and car enthusiasts - are tailor-made versions of famous models from car manufacturers such as Ferrari, Lamborghini and Bentley.

The owners, many of whom arey Qataris, Saudis, Emiratis and Kuwaitis, happily leave their luxury cars parked up on the side of the road, as they move to Britain to escape the Middle East's baking mid-summer months.

But the growing number of sports cars around the wealthy Knightsbridge district is causing some local residents to worry about breaches of parking rules and potential dangerous driving.

Residents in affluent Knightsbridge have
 complained some drivers are allegedley behaving in an anti-social 
manner, revving the cars and treating the exclusive area as their 
personal racetrack.  

Wealthy families from Dubai and Kuwait reportedly had their cars delivered to the Carlton hotel in Cannes where many spend their holidays in the summer months, while other have appeared in the wealthiest suburbs of London

Panda Morgan-Thomas, a management consultant, said: 'I am not angry. I am just exhausted. After a relatively calm three years the last few days have seen the return of supercars to Knightsbridge.

'They are again racing down Sloane Street from late afternoons until 3 or 4 in the morning. We honestly thought we had made progress but it seems as though local residents are in for another sleepless August.'

Most of the wealthy holidaymakers, 
predominantly from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, arrived in London around a 
week ago following the end of Ramadan.

But despite residents dreading 'The Season', there is one group of people salivating at the supercars and leaping to the defence of the drivers - the Carparazzi.

When the wealthy Arabs arrive in London, car enthusiasts show up with their cameras to film and photographer the million-pound motors.

Paul Wallace, who runs the YouTube channel Supercars of London, played down their bad behaviour. He said: 'August always proves to be the best time of year for petrolheads to see their dream machines on the road.

'Having seen the change in driving styles and cars, I still can't believe the police presence and residents kicking up a fuss. For four weeks out of 52, these super-wealthy individuals come and pump millions of pounds into the UK economy.

Fears have been raised that some foreign drivers feel they can flout the rules either
 because they can easily afford the penalties, or because they know 
they'll be able to move home and ignore the fines. Pictured: A Ferrari 
drives in Sloane Street

The cars include a gold Range Rover, various Rolls-Royces, Lamborghinis - pictured above - Ferraris, numerous Bugatti Veyrons and a 1970s Datsun

'Not only that, they fulfill many car fan's dream by bringing super rare Bugatti Veyrons, or special edition Paganis. I feel sorry for these guys coming here with their expensive toys as they get harassed by police.'

Previous summers have seen expensive cars clamped outside department store Harrods, towed for being uninsured and locals complain about being kept awake by revving engines.

Westminster council has revealed the parking fines handed out to cars registered in the United Arab Emirates have nearly doubled in the last three years.

Cars from the Middle-Eastern country were given a whopping £57,060-worth of fines last year, up from just £31,780 in 2011/12.

Fears have been raised that some foreign drivers feel they can flout the rules either because they can easily afford the penalties, or because they know they'll be able to move home and ignore the fines.

A Westminster City Council spokesman said: 'We do all we can to ensure that all outstanding fines are paid – whatever the nationality of the driver.

'However, when cars aren't registered in this country, it is sometimes extremely difficult to track people down.

'We already work with an agency to help recover money owed by European drivers and we're currently exploring other avenues that might further our success. The start and end point here is that every driver who parks in Westminster is subject to the same laws.'
