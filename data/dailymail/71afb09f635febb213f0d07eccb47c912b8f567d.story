A rough sleeper died today after being impaled on the railings outside David Cameron's parish church.

A passer-by discovered the motionless body of the homeless 38-year-old in an alley by St Mary Abbots Church in Kensington at around 6.35am this morning.

Paramedics could not revive the man,   and firefighters were called to free him from the railings.

David Cameron and his wife Samantha worship at St Mary Abbots Church, and their children were baptised there and go to the school next door.

Scotland Yard said this afternoon the death is unexplained but not suspicious. 

Homeless Dave Redmond,39, said : 'The police came up to me this morning just after 8am and asked me if I know any homeless guys who sleep in the church gardens.

'At first I thought that somebody had broken into the church or something stupid like that. But then I saw two forensic vans turn up and I thought it must be something more serious. But what a terrible way to go'. 

Local Resident Nick Selmes, 43, a property consultant, saw the aftermath of the death. 

'I went to the gym about six and there was nothing then - no police or fire crews and no cordon - but when I returned there were several police vehicles and ambulances,' he told the Evening Standard.

'It's a tragedy and shocking that someone could lose their life in such a horrific way'.

One woman who lives just off of Kensington High Street and asked not be named, said : 'Oh my god, that is so sad and so close to the school. I'm so glad the kids are on half-term and didnt see anything. And that is the school where David Cameron's kid goes to as well.

'It is really sad. Why was that poor man trying to climb the fence?'

She added: 'I am really shocked because it is is normally busy at most times of the day. People normally cut through here to get to and from Kensington High Street.'

Another local resident, a man in his 40s, who also asked not to be named, said his daughter goes to the school. He said: 'I'm really glad that it is half-term because if the body was discovered during term time it would be full of school children around here'. 

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The body of the man, who has yet to be identified, was impaled on railings. The man was pronounced dead at the scene. 

'There is nothing at this very early stage to indicate that the death is suspicious. Officers are at the scene and their inquires continue.' 

Theory: Police are investigating whether the man was homeless and trying to get in or out of the locked church gardens

Beautiful: The church is where the Camerons worship and his children go to the linked state primary. The Prime Minister had a memorial built for his son Ivan built inside after his death 

The spokesman added: 'We think he may have been climbing the railings but because it only happened this morning we still have police work to do.'

A spokesman from the London Fire Brigade said: 'The victim is approximately 55 year old male.

'At the scene he was found unconscious, not breathing and no vital signs. He was pronounced dead at the scene.'

St Mary Abbots Church is the Prime Minister's parish church and his children go to the prestigious linked state primary school, just off High Street Kensington.

The Camerons snubbed 15 other primaries closer to their Notting Hill home.

It has 210 pupils, mainly from families of professionals, such as high-flying media figures and architects and an enviable record of being a feeder for fee-paying schools.  

In 2012, three years after the heartbreaking death of their six-year-old son Ivan, David and Samantha Cameron  unveiled a memorial to him there.

In a moving tribute to their son, who suffered severe cerebral palsy, the couple commissioned an arched altar made from English oak.

It bears an inscription on each edge which reads: 'Remember before God 2002 — Ivan Cameron — 2009. A child greatly loved.'
