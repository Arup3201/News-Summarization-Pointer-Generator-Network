Bayern beat Freiburg with headed goals from Robben and Thomas Muller as they moved well clear of second-placed Wolfsburg.

It proved such an uneventful evening at the back for Bayern that sweeper-keeper Manuel Neuer got up to his old tricks, standing near the half-way line as the home side mounted an attack.

In the end, Freiburg goalkeeper Roman Burki did well to repeatedly deny Bayern, who managed 31 attempts on goal during the 2-0 win.
