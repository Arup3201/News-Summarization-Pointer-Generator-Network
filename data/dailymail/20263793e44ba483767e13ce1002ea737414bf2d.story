Sussex Police has become the first force fit patients with GPS tracking devices to save money searching for them when they go missing

Patients with dementia are to be tagged by the police for the first time in a bid to save time and money when they go missing.

Sussex Police has become the first force to fit pensioners with GPS tracking devices and hopes the move will save hundreds of thousands of pounds currently spent on extra staff and helicopters.

It has bought 15 GPS tags which can be worn around a
patient’s neck, clipped to a belt or attached to a set of house keys.

The device sends details of the person's location 
to a website every four minutes.

As long as the wearer has a mobile signal, they can be located anywhere in the world.

There are currently 800,000 people with dementia in the UK and the number is expected to rise to more than a million by 2021.

A number of 
local authorities are already using similar devices to track sufferers, 
but this is believed to be the first time a police force has taken on 
such a scheme.

But
critics have branded the move as 'completely wrong'. Dot Gibson, 
general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, described the 
policy as 'barbaric'.

She
said: 'I think they should withdraw it straight away. Trying to equate 
somebody who has committed a criminal act with somebody who is suffering
dementia is completely wrong.

'I doubt whether anyone in the Cabinet would want their parents dealt with in this way if they were suffering from dementia.'

'If
you've got people in the community who are so bad that they are 
wandering off at night and are not safe, they should be properly cared 
for, they shouldn't be tagged.

'It's a crude form of monitoring when 
the issue needs a much more detailed response than this. This is a 
back-of-an-envelope response.'

The trial will cost the force £400 a 
month, but if successful, will be rolled out across the county, which has a higher than average number of elderly people.

The MindMe scheme, as it is known, will 
be paid for by Sussex Police but monitored by  Chichester Careline, a company run by 
Chichester District Council.

The devices cost £27.50 a month, which includes round-the-clock monitoring.

A number of local authorities are already using similar devices to track sufferers, but this is believed to be the first time a police force has taken on such a scheme

Sergeant Suzie Mitchell, from 
Chichester Neighbourhood Response Team, said: 'The scheme is only 
costing Sussex Police a few hundred pounds but comparing this to police 
time, resources, potential risk to the missing person let alone the 
anxiety and worry for their family, it is in my opinion, a few hundred pounds really well spent.'

Eileen Lintill, of Chichester District Council, added that the devices give vulnerable people, and their relatives, peace of mind.

She said: 'Hundreds of thousands of 
people across the country have dementia. This solution gives both those 
with dementia and their families the confidence and reassurance they 
need.

'The latest model also allows customers to speak to us directly by pressing a button.

'This can be used by anyone who wants
to maintain their independence, but have the reassurance that someone 
is always around to help them.'

But Bill Bentley, an East Sussex Conservative councillor who is responsible for adult social care in the region, believes the tracking system could stigmatise dementia patients.

He said: 'It’s about getting the balance between a person’s wishes and imposing a technological solution on them that they may or may not wish to have happened.'

Joanne Taylor and her mother Anne Grimshaw, who has a GPS tacking device to locate her when she goes missing

Dementia sufferer Anne Grimshaw, 78, has been fitted with a GPS tracking device because she gets lost so often when out walking.

The transmitter, known as a Buddi, is attached to her keys and sends out an update of her position every five minutes.

If she wanders too far from her bungalow in Rochdale, or suffers a fall, her daughter Joanne Taylor receives a phone call from the Buddi team.

Mrs Taylor is also able to log on to her computer or iPad to see a map showing her mother’s exact location.

Mrs Taylor said the device, supplied by Rochdale Council’s assisted technology department, had enabled the great-grandmother to retain her independence rather than having to be put in a home.

She said: ‘The police once brought her home when she was found on the hard shoulder of the motorway. She doesn’t think there is anything wrong but she gets completely lost.

‘One day she went missing for 12 hours and caused a massive police search. We live near the moors and I was sick with worry.’

Mrs Taylor says others should consider a tracking device for their relatives.

‘There are thousands in my position whose lives would be changed if they knew about Buddi,’ she said.

She added: ‘My mother’s independence is key to her and I think your independence is just about everything to you especially if you can live in your own home and be in your own surroundings.

‘But you have got to be safe at the same time. I know my mum would hate being in a home and I believe she would have deteriorated.'
