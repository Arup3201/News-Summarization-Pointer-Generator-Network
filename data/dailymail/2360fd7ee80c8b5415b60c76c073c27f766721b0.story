Swimmers in Florida have been warned about a deadly flesh-eating bacteria that is carried in seawater after three people were killed in the state last month.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that Vibrio vulnificus can enter the body through open wounds or when people swallow water containing the bacteria.

So far there have been 13 confirmed cases of infection in Florida, resulting in three fatalities - one in Lee, one in Dixie County and one in Sarasota - according to the Florida Department of Health’s latest figures.

Warning: Three people have died from an infection so far in Florida, including one swimmer in Sarasota

The bacteria occurs naturally in the warm Gulf Coast waters and thrives during the summer months.

Symptoms of infection include vomiting, fever, 
diarrhoea, low blood pressure, swelling and pain in the areas of the 
skin that have been infected.

Most swimmers are unaffected by the bacteria but it can enter the body through an open wound or sore and eat away the flesh.

Anyone 
with a low immune system - including people suffering from cancer, 
kidney disorders, chronic liver disease or HIV - is also at higher risk of 
being infected.

Precaution: Tourists are being advised to wash themselves after swimming and to avoid raw shellfish

People have also been warned against eating raw shellfish, which often contains the bacteria.

There is no evidence that it can be transmitted from person to person though, according to the CDC.

Florida's 
state epidemiologist, Carina Blackmore, said: ‘People with underlying 
health problems and people who are immune-compromised, especially those 
with chronic liver disease, are at higher risk.

‘The bacteria have toxins that are destroying the cells in the tissue. The cells end up dying from the toxin exposure.’

The 
infection can be treated with antibiotics but people have been advised 
to seek medical treatment immediately as patients could require surgery 
or even amputation if the disease spreads.

Swimmers have also been advised to wash themselves thoroughly after swimming in the sea.

Around 95 cases of infection are reported in the U.S. each year, 35 of which result in death. In 2013, 41 cases were reported in Florida, resulting in 11 deaths.

Along with Florida, infections have also been reported in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.
