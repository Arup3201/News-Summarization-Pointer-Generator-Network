An 'outstanding' hospital doctor has been jailed for six months after he supplied meow meow and date-rape drugs to a university polo club president who  choked to death on a sock after a night out.

Dr James Morgan, 29, gave the cocktail of drugs to trained huntsman James Steen, after inviting him and two other friends back to his home in Rugby, Warwickshire, at the end of the night.

The doctor, who had only met Mr Steen that night, gave the 23-year-old media student class B drug Mephedrone and class C drug gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), one of the most common date-rape drugs.

'Talented': The trained huntsman (pictured), who was President of the Polo Society at Newcastle University, had gone back to Morgan's house following a night out with him and two other friends

But the court heard how the student, from Poyntzpass, near Newry, Northern Ireland, had a fetish for sniffing socks and later suffocated to death after partially swallowing one.

Jailing him at Warkwick Crown Court, a judge told Morgan that his career had been left in tatters for committing the 'terrible dereliction of duty'.

Judge Sylvia de Bertodano added that, as a doctor, Morgan should have lived up to his 'position of authority'  - and known more than anyone that drugs 'ruin lives'.

She said: 'It's tragic cases like this which reinforce the message courts send out when they sentence for the supply of drugs, that drugs of whatever class ruin lives.

'You, better than anyone, should know that. You are not only a doctor, you are an outstanding one. So as well as taking James's life, you have ruined your own life. Your career, which you worked so hard to build, is in jeopardy.'

She added: 'As a doctor, even in a social context, you were in a position of authority. He had taken a great deal more of the class C drug than any of the other three of you.

'Allowing that to happen was a terrible dereliction of your duty.

'The message has to go out that if someone, in particular a doctor, supplies a non-drug-user with illegal drugs and they die as a result, they must go to prison.'  

Tragic: Judge Sylvia de Bertodano said Mr Steen's 'tragic' death sent out the message that 'drugs or whatever class ruin lives'. 

She also offered her sympathies to Mr Steen's family, saying: 'You are going to have to work very hard to rebuild your life - but that is something James Steen will never be able to do.   

'James Steen was a young man on the very threshold of life. He had everything to live for. Nothing you can do, and I can do today can reconcile his family to their loss.' 

Morgan, who worked as registrar at Coventry's University Hospital, met Mr Steen through his partner Simon Chapman and his friend John Deptford.

Mr Deptford, who played for Northampton Outlaws Rugby Club, had befriended Mr Steen online and stayed with him when he visited Newcastle. 

'Threshold of life': She added that Morgan had committed a 'terrible dereliction of duty' by allowing Mr Steen (pictured) to take drugs, despite him being a doctor 'in a position of authority'

Promising: The student (left and right), from Poyntzpass, near Newry, Northern Ireland, was a keen skier and was studying media, communications and cultural studies at Newcastle University

The student, who was a keen skier, lived in Newcastle while studying media, communications and cultural studies at the university.

The court heard Mr Steen had travelled to Rugby for a meal with Mr Deptford, Mr Chapman and Morgan.

The four men went to the Steam Turbine pub in the town and had a meal before moving on to another pub.

Prosecutor Lal Amarasinghe told the court they all went back to Morgan's Victorian terraced home, where he got a bottle of 'poppers' which was passed round to sniff.

He said: 'Mr Deptford, who had been quite drunk, could not recall anything else until waking up and realising he and the other three were all naked and Mr Steen was lying on the floor.

'Everything to live for': The night before his death he travelled down to Rugby for a meal with Mr Deptford - who had befriended Steen online - Mr Chapman and Morgan. The four men later went back to Morgan's home 

'Realising something was wrong, he pinched him to try to get a reaction, but without any response, and immediately called to Morgan who examined the student.

'An ambulance was called, and as they waited they tried to resuscitate Mr Steen but realised his airway was blocked.

'Mr Deptford, who knew Mr Steen had a fetish for sniffing socks and putting them in his mouth, found he had a sock blocking his throat, and pulled it out. Paramedics then arrived, but Mr Steen was already beyond help.'

Morgan was arrested in the street nearby on suspicion of murder. That was later reduced to supplying drugs.

The court heard how police found traces of Mephedrone, a synthetic stimulant, on a chopping board and a bottle which had contained GBL, which can be an anaesthetic and hypnotic agent, in the property. 

In large amounts it can cause respiratory failure.

Spirit: After his death, Mr Steen's parents said their son had been a 'kind, caring, intelligent and very talented young man, with a generous spirit'

The court heard Mr Steen died of respiratory failure as a result of a blockage of his airway, although the drugs were said to be a ‘direct contributor’ to that. 

Christopher Millington QC, defending, said: 'This was a talented student, and the consequence of his death has caused terrible grief to his family.

'This case is tragic in many ways. At the heart of it is the death of a talented student, and in the dock to face the consequences is a gifted doctor.

'The case is complicated by this fact: as we understand it, the cause of death was asphyxiation.

'What the deceased had done was put a sock in his mouth which, according to Mr Deptford, he had partially swallowed. Nobody knew it was there until after his death.

'The role the drug played is that it increased the risk of asphyxiation. It was not the direct cause of death.'

He added that the consequences of jailing Morgan would be to deprive the public 'of the services of a gifted doctor.'

He said there was a 'stand-out reference' from Dr Belinda Stanley, a member of the GMC's disciplinary tribunal, who described Morgan as 'among the best she has ever worked with.'

Mr Millington added: 'The sad fact is that having devoted so many years of his life to becoming a doctor, he has put his career in jeopardy because of the irresponsibility he displayed during that social gathering.

'That is something he will have to live with, together with the guilt and feeling of responsibility over the death of the deceased.'

After Mr Steen's death, his family described the young man as 'kind, caring and very talented'.

In a statement released through police, they said: 'James enriched our lives, and the lives of others, in so many ways.

'He was a kind, caring, intelligent and very talented young man, with a generous spirit. He touched everyone he met with his positivity and his sense of humour.

'We are devastated by James' untimely death, but we are comforted by knowing how much he was loved and admired by his family, friends and university colleagues.

'We are immensely proud of our son, and all he achieved and the significant mark he made during his brief time on this earth.'
