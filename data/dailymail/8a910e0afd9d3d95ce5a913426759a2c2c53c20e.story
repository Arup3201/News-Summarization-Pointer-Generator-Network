Police had to ferry sick patients to hospital last night as over-stretched NHS services struggled to cope with yesterdays strike.

Desperate ambulance chiefs made a plea to the Metropolitan police yesterday evening as they were hit with a deluge of emergency calls.

Staff were supposed to provide 'emergency cover', which is the level that unions and the
Service have agreed staff working in frontline roles can provide
while still supporting industrial action.

But this morning, Mr Killens said: 'It is disappointing that,
despite asking staff to return to work as normal or volunteer for
emergency cover during the afternoon when we had significant
numbers of patients waiting for ambulances and had declared an
internal major incident, few did so.'

He added: 'We will carry out a detailed review of the events of yesterday,
and we have already started discussions with the unions about
this.'

The astonishing scenes were played out as the London Ambulance Service revealed it was under 'increased pressure', with 
30 per cent more 999 calls today than normal, according to NHS London. Some 42 per cent 
of its staff are on strike.

Commander Simon Pountain in charge of the today's policing operation for the public services demonstration said: 'It is normal for the emergency services to work together on large scale events and incidents and the MPS will provide whatever support is necessary to the LAS.

'Whilst these are exceptional circumstances, we will work with colleagues from the other blue light services to provide whatever support and assistance we can to help. All police officers are first aid trained.

Yesterday the Deputy Director of Operations, Jason
Killens, urged patient's only to call them in an absolute emergency, 
adding: 'We are still under severe pressure and expect this to increase 
over the next few hours as a result of today's industrial action.

'There are still a number of patients 
who are waiting for an ambulance response and it is more important than 
ever for Londoners to only dial 999 for an ambulance if somebody's life 
is in danger.

'We have asked unions to encourage their
members to return to work as normal or increase their emergency cover, 
as per the agreement with Union and GMB.'

However, the picture varies across the UK, with some trusts facing major disruption while others are working as close to normal as possible.

Today, the NHS is more or less operating as if it was a weekend or Bank Holiday. Emergency and trauma care will be the priority.

NHS trusts across the country have 
written to patients informing them not to come in, although they are 
still providing emergency and critical care.

In
England, the Government estimates around 60,000 non-urgent operations, 
out-patient appointments, tests and follow-up appointments have been 
postponed while in Scotland at least 3,000 operations and thousands more
hospital appointments are affected.

They estimate around 400,000 nurses and healthcare 
assistants, paramedics, physiotherapists and support staff like cleaners
and administrators are joining the action.

The 24-hour walkout by two 
million public sector workers was called in response to the bitter row 
over pensions. Unions are furious over plans to reform pensions which 
will involve members working longer and having to pay more. 

As the strike got underway today Health Secretary Andrew Lansley told 
BBC News that NHS staff would still have the 'best pension scheme 
available' after the changes and negotiations were ongoing.

'Unfortunately this (the strike) is 
happening at the point of course when we tend to go into winter 
pressures and the consequences of Christmas and New Year,' he said.

'It makes it harder. Not great timing. It will inconvenience patients, I'm disappointed about that.'

Mr Lansley added: 'I asked staff to 
consider patients' interest first. I hope that many staff who have been 
balloted to go on strike will choose not to go on strike.'

Mr Lansley said patients who had an appointment today should get it rescheduled so they are still treated within 18 weeks.

'Our objective will continue to be to ensure that patients have their NHS Constitution right to treatment within 18 weeks of referral by their GP, and that diagnostic tests, they get that within six weeks,' he said.

'We will continue to do that.'

More than half of the 100,000 Unite members are thought to be taking industrial action, as are swathes of Unison members.

However, the British Medical Association, Royal College of Nursing and Royal College of Midwives are not.

Christina McAnea, head of health at 
Unison, said: 'It is outrageous that the Department of Health are 
desperately trying to hide the fact that NHS services are being 
disrupted across the UK.

'Our members are reporting fantastic support for the day of action.'

Most hospitals in Merseyside, Cheshire and north Wales said only urgent appointments and surgery were taking place.

The Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust said all planned operations had been cancelled, together with 'virtually all' outpatient clinics. A spokesman for Colchester Hospital said it had postponed 34 operations and re-scheduled 14.

In Manchester, around 200 non-urgent outpatient appointments have been cancelled at the Wythenshawe Hospital.

A
spokesman said all other services will be operating as normal and 
patients who have not already heard from the trust should attend 
hospital as planned.

Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
said, so far, 211 out of 1,149 outpatient appointments have been 
cancelled and 47 out of 99 elective inpatient and day case operations 
have been cancelled.

The trust said patients who have not been told their appointment has been cancelled should attend as normal.

Pat Oliver, director of operations, 
said: 'The hospital will be running similar to a Christmas Day service, 
which means that all essential and emergency services will run as 
normal.

'However, 
services are likely to be under extra pressure so we would ask people to
bear with us as they may experience some delays as patients will be 
seen in order of clinical priority.'

The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, 
which runs five hospitals - the Royal Oldham Hospital, North Manchester 
and Fairfield General Hospitals, Rochdale Infirmary and Birch Hill - 
said no operations have been cancelled so far and they were expecting 
'minimal disruption'.

A number of non-urgent routine outpatient physiotherapy and orthopaedic clinics have been postponed and rescheduled.

Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust said around 300 planned procedures, including operations, and outpatient appointments have been rescheduled.

'Managers
and frontline staff have worked closely together to ensure that all 
essential services provided by the trust continue,' a spokesman said.

'Some elective procedures and outpatient appointments on the day have been rescheduled and we have already been in contact with these patients to ensure that any inconvenience is minimised.'

The Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust said most outpatient appointments and planned operations are going ahead as planned. There will be limited non-urgent patient transport services.

NHS Milton Keynes and Northamptonshire said there was 'minimal disruption' to health services and their ambulance service was unaffected by strikes.

A spokesman said: 'Hospital contingency planning has seen some non-urgent surgery and outpatient appointments postponed from today.'

The University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust said only a small number of operations had had to be cancelled and no outpatient clinics needed to be rearranged.

South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, which covers emergencies in Kent, Sussex and Surrey, said its ability to respond to patients had been 'significantly hampered" by the  walkouts. It is only responding to life-threatening emergencies.

But a spokesman for East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust said 'no planned operations have been cancelled' and a 'minimal amount of appointments have been affected'.

The Great Western Ambulance Service (GWAS), which covers Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and the former Avon, said it was committed to providing a safe and effective 999 service but urged those with less serious conditions to seek help elsewhere.

Ken Wenman, GWAS interim chief executive, said: 'Our staff are passionate about patient care, but also feel strongly for their pensions and the expectation that they must work until they are 68 years age in what is an extremely demanding job.

'Although there is no doubt that the strike action will cause some disruption to normal services, we are working with unions and with our staff directly to ensure contingency plans are in place so together we can protect the 999 service and continue to provide safe, excellent care to our patients wherever and whenever they need us.'

There is expected to be a full patient transport service for patients with essential, planned appointments for renal, cancer and palliative care services.

A spokeswoman from Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital said around 100 elective operations are normally performed each day.

Today, around 45 are being carried out, all of which are either operations for paediatric or cancer patients.

The Christie NHS Foundation Trust
in Manchester, which specialises in cancer care, said they were not 
anticipating cancelling any planned operations and were contacting 
patients to ensure they keep their appointments.

Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust
said 41 elective operations - 80 per cent of the elective workload - 
had been cancelled and rescheduled. Outpatient clinics have also been 
cancelled but emergency and trauma care will continue.

A spokeswoman from Scarborough and North East Yorkshire Healthcare NHS Trust said no planned operations had been cancelled.

In North Wales, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which covers hospitals in Bangor, Conwy and Wrexham, said it cancelled 92 operations and 1,097 appointments. On a typical day it would have between 200 and 250 operations.
