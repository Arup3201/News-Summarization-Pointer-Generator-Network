Rap artist Jay-Z's management agency, Roc Nation Sports, has added Georgia running back Todd Gurley to its client list.

Gurley intends to become eligible for the 2015 NFL Draft early and has been lauded as a potential star in the making from college football. The deadline for underclassmen to do so is January 15. 

He joins Dallas Cowboys' Dez Bryant, NBA star Kevin Durant and Detroit Lions' Ndamukong Suh on the books at management company Roc Nation.

It comes after controversial boxer Adrien Broner  issued a grovelling apology to Jay-Z and singer Rihanna after he launched a scathing attack on the pair last week.

Jay-Z, real name Shawn Corey Carter, offered Broner a contract worth $8million (£5.2million) a year for five years  but the fighter turned it down after being 'offended' by Roc Nation's deal.

In a stunning statement on Facebook, Broner claimed that Jay-Z could 'suck his d***', before continuing his attack during an interview with TMZ Sports. 

When asked if he had considered accepting the offer to enable him to get 'one degree closer' to singer Rihanna - who is also signed to Jay-Z's label - Broner claimed: 'F*** Rihanna, she's only good for p***y.' 

But the boxer, who has a record of 29 wins to one loss, has since backtracked on his claims, apologising to both parties in a second interview with TMZ.

'I've gotta address something because I'm getting a lot of feedback from this interview I did with TMZ,' Broner said. 'I was going to let it ride out and say, "Forget the haters", but my big homie called me, somebody that I respect, and he made me understand why I was wrong.'
