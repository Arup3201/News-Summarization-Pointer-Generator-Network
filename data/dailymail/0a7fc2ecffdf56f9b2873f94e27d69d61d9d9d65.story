A six-month-old baby girl who died after she was shot sitting on her father's lap in his van was buried amid emotional scenes in a Chicago church yesterday.

As the tiny body of Jonylah Watkins lay before mourners in an open coffin, Reverend Corey Brooks, who led the service, called on local gang members - with whom her father was allegedly connected - to change.

And the baby's maternal grandmother Mary Young read a poem pleading for the local community to change, saying: 'My neighbours of Chicago, what have thou done?'

In his eulogy Reverend Corey Brooks called on gang members to use Jonylah's death as a catalyst to change their lifestyles

Jonylah died last week when she was struck by a bullet police say was intended for her father, former offender Jonathan Watkins, 29.

The bullet tore through several organs in her body in what was the second time the infant had been a victim of gunfire: when her mother Judy, 20, was eight months pregnant, she was shot in the knee as she walked home with a group of women.

Jonylah's father was shot twice in the attack that killed his daughter but survived.

Frustrated by the lack of progress in their murder investigation, police say no-one has come forward to help from the local community.

At yesterday's funeral, Jonylah's grandmother hit out at the culture of silence in a poem she had written for the service.

She said: 'My neighbours of Chicago, our youth is in danger on the streets of the town with the false code of silence while they shoot each other down.

'My neighbours of Chicago, take back your home.  Don't spare the rod and leave your children to roam.'

Rev. Corey Brooks echoed Mrs Watkins' sentiments in his eulogy, saying: 'I want to challenge you to get clean, change, and that change starts with believing you can change.' reported yahoo.com.

Jonylah had been sitting in her father's lap in the driver's seat of a parked minivan on March 11 when a gunman opened fire.

The baby, whose mother was working at McDonalds at the time, died the next morning from her wounds after surgeons spent hours trying to save her.

Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said the shooting appeared to be gang-related, though detectives don't have a specific motive.

Despite the shocking crime, neighbors are refusing to cooperate with police.

'We don't have one individual who's stepping up to help us,' McCarthy said.

Chicago continues to struggle with devastating gun violence at some of the highest rates in the nation.

The city had 57 murders in January and February - including 43 in January alone, the most violent month in a decade.

The number grabbed national headlines at a time when Congress was debating tougher gun control laws.

Many - if not most - of the killings are the result of gang-related violence that is largely concentrated on the city's south side.

The 43 murders in January in Chicago compare to just 24 in New York for the same month - despite the Big Apple being three times the size of the Windy City.

The killing of Jonylah Watkins is only the latest high-profile Chicago murder to shock the nation.

Just days after she performed at President Barack Obama's inauguration ceremony in Washington, Hadiya Pendleton, 15, was killed on the street near her home.

Still, there is good news. In February the city charged just 14 murders - the lowest number since 1957.

Mr Watkins told the Chicago Sun-Times from his hospital room that he was devastated by the death of his infant daughter.

'I was trying to help. I was trying to help. I was trying to help her,' he said, breaking down.

Still, he claims he has no idea who shot him or why he was targeted.

The fatal shooting came months after Jonylah's mother Judy, 20, was hit by a gunman when she was pregnant with Jonylah.

Her family said Mrs Watkins was hit in the knee when she was eight months pregnant as she walked home with a group of women.

In January and February this year, 57 people were killed in Chicago - most of them victims of gang-related shootings on the south side of the city.

Chicago gained national attention when its murders for January spiked to 43, the highest rate in years - making the city even more dangerous than when mobster Al Capone ruled the streets.

In February killings dropped to 14 for the month - the lowest since 1957.

Police said Mr Watkins,had links to the Gangster Disciples clique, though his family denies he has ties to gangs.

The gunman shot at the father and baby from an alley and hit Mr Watkins in the cheek and buttocks, Chicago police spokesman John Mirabelli said.

The gunman then got into a nearby blue minivan and fled the scene, according to DNAinfo.

Dominique Young, 21, Mr Watkins' sister, said she heard the gunfire and arrived at the van within seconds to find the windows had been shot through.

She told DNAinfo: ‘They knew she was in there and they tried to take my niece's life, and it's so wrong.'

Rev Brooks' church New Beginnings Church of Chicago is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest.

The family have called on the 'cowardly' gunman to turn himself in.
