Being a racing car enthusiast, you would think grandfather Peter Bradley may have clocked up a few speeding tickets over the years. 

Despite owning more than 20 Porsches since he bought his first in 1957 and driving the equivalent of 40 trips around the earth, the 82-year-old has never broken down or had a fine. 

Careful driver Peter, who still helps to run the family business Bradley Refrigeration Ltd, in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, put his amazing record down to his love of Porsches.

Petrol-head: Peter Bradley has clocked up his millionth mile in Porsche cars which he has owned since 1957

The grandfather said: 'When I get behind the wheel of such great machinery you don't need to show off.

'Every time I turn the ignition key I know I am going on a fabulous journey in a superb motor car.

'It's like being a jockey on a thoroughbred horse and I've enjoyed every mile of my many journeys in my many Porsches.'

Mr Bradley owned VW Beetles but always dreamed of owning a Porsche.

'I had always been very impressed with Porsches as race cars. They were not perhaps the fastest, but they were the most reliable and always finished the race,' he said.

He remembers purchasing his first Porsche on August 5, 1857, like it was yesterday - a 356 in ice blue for £1,200.

'I bought it from the factory in Germany and drove it all around Europe. I did 6,000 miles just getting it back home and had it serviced in Paris,' he said.

Despite owning more than 20 Porsches since he bought his first in 1957 Peter Bradley has never had a speeding ticket

'Since then I've been back to that factory more times than I care to remember and I've seen that many Porsches being built I could probably assemble one myself.'

Mr Bradley tends to keep a car for 18 months to three years and often owns more than one model at a time.

The last model he bought was a 997s, but he sold it six months later because it was 'a bit quick' for him.

'I've never had a speeding point on my driving licence since I started driving Porsches 56 years ago.

'I was stopped for going too fast once, but that was before you got points on your licence.

'I can't even begin to calculate how much I have spent on Porsches, but they have been worth every penny.'
