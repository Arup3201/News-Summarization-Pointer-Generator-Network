It's been in need of a roof to protect it from the elements for 328 years.

And now Clifford's Tower in York has finally got some respite with an art installation inspired by Britain's wet summer.

The exhibit, a canopy of 45 colourful umbrellas suspended within the castle's walls of Clifford's, will keep visitors to a historic tower under cover for the first time since 1684.

It is the first time the medieval tower has had any kind of covering since an explosion blew off the roof in that year.

The umbrellas are hung level with the
walk around the ramparts of Clifford's Tower so that views over the 
city of York are not interrupted.

Louise Wyatt, site manager at 
Clifford's Tower, said: 'The idea came out of the rather damp summer 
that we've had, when someone joked that it would be wonderful to have a 
huge umbrella over the open courtyard - and then we started thinking 
about what else could be done with umbrellas.

'We found some pictures online of 
streets in Europe that had been covered with suspended umbrellas and 
realised that the quatrefoil shape of Clifford's Tower would lend itself
to such a display fantastically.'

Ms Wyatt added: 'The tower was used 
as a store for gunpowder and munitions in the 17th century and, on April
23, 1684, an explosion blew off the roof and the floors, leaving just 
the shell that you see today, so it has been over 400 years since the 
tower last had any kind of roof covering.'

The Umbrella Sky will remain in place until Sunday October 21, weather permitting.

The Umbrella Sky will remain in place until October 21, weather permitting. Clifford's Tower is all that remains of York Castle, originally built by William the Conqueror

Downpour: The umbrellas would have come in handy when the area surrounding the tower flooded two weeks ago
