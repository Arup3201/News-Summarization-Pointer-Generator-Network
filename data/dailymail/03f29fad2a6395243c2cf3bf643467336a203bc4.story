An inquest has been opened into the death of a talented horse rider who tragically died after being kicked by a horse she had raised since birth.

Mary Hancy, 55, was grooming one of her horses in a yard last Sunday when it kicked out at her and left her with head and abdomen injuries.

An air ambulance rushed her to Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge after the accident but doctors could not save her life.

She had worked for Howard Rose at the Crows Hall Hannoverian Stud in Norwich, Norfolk, and competed in equestrian events all her life.

Her daughter Kelly Hancy, 24, said her mum had worked with horses since the age of 13 and was in the 'wrong place at the wrong time'.

She said: 'She has left a massive gap that can never be replaced. If I can do half as good a job as she did then I will be pleased.

'She was amazing really. She was so strong could do anything she wanted to with horses. I would always go to her for advice.

'I would always be on the yard with mum and I think it was her favourite place. She was like my best friend.

'We were just clipping at the time and it was the last horse that she had bred. She was very proud of him. He was only five years-old and he was a bit spooked by something and kicked out and caught her.

'It was just a case of the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't know what is going to happen to the horse now.'

Mrs Hancy, who lived in Ashill, Norfolk, would frequently groom her daughter's horse in preparation for competitions.

She also worked as a lorry driver for family haulage business R Hancy and Sons that she ran with her husband Steve, 59.

But her real passion was horses and her close friend Howard Rose said the whole of the horsing community was in 'shock'.

He said: 'She was an exceptional horsewoman and worked for me since she was 13 years old.

'Mary was one of those people that if someone was in trouble she would be sure to help. We're all in shock really, it's terribly sad.'
