Sir Bob Geldof is preparing to release a new Band Aid single 30 years after Do They Know It’s Christmas? first topped the charts.

The new charity track, Band Aid 30, is expected to feature boyband One Direction, none of whose members were born when the classic hit was released in 1984.

Sir Bob, 60, and 61-year-old Scottish musician Midge Ure – who co-wrote the first Band Aid track – will announce the full details of the project tomorrow.

Other stars rumoured to be involved are singers Adele, 26, Ed Sheeran, 23, Ben Howard, 27, Florence Welch, 28, and indie rock band Alt-J.

Do They Know It’s Christmas?, which featured Bono, George Michael, Paul Weller, Boy George and Simon le Bon, was the biggest-selling single of all time in the UK when it was first released.

It led to the successful Live Aid concerts in 1985, which raised around £150million for the fight against famine in Ethiopia.

Since then, there have been two further charity recordings of the same track, Band Aid II in 1989 and Band Aid 20 in 2004, both of which also topped the charts.

Band Aid II included contributions from Jason Donovan, Kylie Minogue, Bananarama and Sir Cliff Richard among others, while Band Aid 20 featured Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, Sir Paul McCartney and Dizzee Rascal

The 2004 version raised money for famine relief in the war ravaged Sudanese region of Darfur.

Alt-J are also thought to be involved with the project, which comes 30 years after the original Band Aid single

Although it also reached Number 1, it sold just over one million copies, compared with the 3.5million sold by the original hit.

Band Aid 20 was also criticised by the World Development Movement, which said many of the song lyrics were ‘patronising, false and out of date’.

Its director Mark Curtis said at the time: ‘The song perpetuates the myth that Africa’s problems can somehow be blamed on lack of rainfall and failed harvests.

‘It conjures up an image of a continent inhabited entirely by starving children with flies on their faces sitting in the sunbaked bed of a dried up stream.’

Band Aid 20 (pictured), featuring the likes of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, Sir Paul McCartney and Dizzee Rascal, saw the re-release of Do They Know It's Christmas? to mark the 20th anniversary of the original in 1984

It is thought Band Aid 30 will also be a recording of Do They Know It’s Christmas? and may help raise funds to fight the Ebola crisis in west Africa.

Sir Bob recently revealed that reuniting with his band the Boomtown Rats had helped him cope with his grief after the death of his daughter Peaches from a heroin overdose in April.

He said: ‘For those two hours I’m utterly, utterly lost in it. Somehow you’re allowed this other thing to come out and it is utterly cathartic, and so for two hours I forget it. I forget that stuff.’
