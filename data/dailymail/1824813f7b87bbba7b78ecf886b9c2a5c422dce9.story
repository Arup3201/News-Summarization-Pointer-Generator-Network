Britain’s smallest man fell victim to an hilarious prank during his Ice Bucket Challenge as his family concocted a plan that resulted in him being soaked by two buckets of water.

Michael Henbury, the 2ft 11in actor best known as a Harry Potter goblin, completed the challenge in support of his friend Kevin Lamb from Southampton who is receiving treatment for myeloma cancer.

Mr Henbury, who was nominated by a colleague at the UK Border Force in Southampton, said it had been agreed that only a small bucket of water would be appropriate because of his small size.

In the video the entertainer's nephew Simon Leah, 10, is seen pouring a small bucket of water over Mr Henbury. 

The star then subsequently suggests the challenge was not as difficult as he had anticipated. He said, 'Nothing to it really' and adds, 'I don't know what all the fuss was about; it was quite easy.'

However, moments later, much to the delight of Mr Henbury's family, Michael's son Joseph, 13, is seen tipping a second larger bucket of iced water over the actor's head. 

Good cause: Mr Henbury was in good spirits before the charity Ice Bucket Challenge

As his family laugh hysterically Mr Henbury is seen grimacing as the water flows down his body.

Despite the unpleasant surprise the 53 year-old, who also starred as Ewok in Return of the Jedi, had the grace to laugh off the prank. He says, 'I nearly drowned there. I may have to go to A&E now. There's bits of me that have frozen.'
