Worried: Prime Minister Mario Monti raised concerns that Sicily was on the cusp of defaulting on its debt

Italy’s economic woes refuse to go away with ten cities including Naples and Palermo reportedly struggling to manage their own finances.

The country has taken steps to try and sure up its economy on a national level in recent weeks, but the report by daily newspaper La Stampa today highlights growing concerns about the state of local finances.

According to the newspaper unnamed government specialists say the euro zone's third largest economy is under severe stress at a regional level.

Last week Prime Minister Mario Monti 
raised concerns that the autonomous area of Sicily was on the cusp of 
defaulting on its debt.

The news comes in the wake of Spanish
reports that six regional authorities are on the brink of following the
Vatican’s request for financial aid, as they struggle to keep afloat.

In Italy local level funding issues 
do not add to the country’s 2trillion euro public debt, but they 
highlight the fact that the economic crisis is not solely biting at a national level.

La Stampa said a provision in the government's spending review obliging municipal authorities to make a 25 per cent cut in the book value of certain assets had revealed big holes in municipal accounts.

The assets in question include 
anticipated revenues from sources such as fines or waste management 
taxes, often over-estimated in budget plans by authorities that know 
they cannot expect to collect all of the projected funds.

With the economy deep in recession and the central government looking to cut spending sharply, the heavy costs of bloated and wasteful local public administrations, particularly in southern Italy, are being laid bare.

But local authorities have also long complained that successive budget cuts have squeezed their resources while leaving them responsible for many vital municipal services.

Even in the prosperous north, some cities are having trouble with Alessandria, near Genoa in the northwest declaring a state of financial emergency last month under the weight of 100 million euros in debt.
