Ebola could have a devastating effect on Africa's gorilla population, researchers have warned.

They say the virus has already affected primates - and caused major changes in the way they reproduce.

It has even broken up groups and forced infected animals out of their families.

The disease can influence reproductive potential, immigration and social dynamics, researchers say

Ecologist Peter Walsh with the University of Cambridge watched 90 to 95 percent of the gorillas he was studying in a Congolese sanctuary disappear in two Ebola outbreaks in the early 2000s.

He co-authored a scientific assessment that put the western lowland gorilla on the critically endangered list in 2007.

“The combination of bushmeat hunting and disease was really slamming western gorillas,” he said.

Walsh and his colleagues estimated that Ebola would wipe out 45 percent of the entire population in just one generation.

Researcher studied animals affected by a previous outbreak in the Republic of Congo.

The gorillas that were affected by an Ebola virus outbreak shows that disease can influence reproductive potential, immigration and social dynamics.

Researchers say it highlights the need to develop complex models that integrate all the different impacts of a disease.

This approach requires long-term monitoring of wildlife populations to understand the responses of populations to emerging changes in the environment, according to the Journal of Animal Ecology study.

'Along with the decrease in survival and in reproduction, Ebola outbreak perturbed social dynamics in gorilla populations,' said Dr. Pascaline Le Gouar of the University of Rennes, the senior author of the study.

Scientists estimate that in a worst-case scenario, Ebola would wipe out 45 percent of the entire population in just one generation

'During outbreak, transfers of both males and females between social units increased. 

'Some adult females have been observed transferring to non-breeding groups, which is unusual in non-affected population. 

'Although, six year after outbreak, most of vital rates returned to pre epidemic rate, recovery of the population is slow, especially because no compensatory immigration occurred after outbreak indicating that the neighboring populations might have been also affected,'
