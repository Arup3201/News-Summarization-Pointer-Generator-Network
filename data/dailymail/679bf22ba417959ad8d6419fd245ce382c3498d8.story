Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has heaped praise on Shinji Kagawa by calling the former Manchester United midfielder 'the sausage in a sandwich'.

Klopp decided to bring Kagawa back to the Bundesliga in the summer after the 25-year-old failed to settle into life at Old Trafford.

However Kagawa appears to have had no such trouble impressing his manager since returning to Westfalenstadion despite scoring just one league goal since completing a £6.3million move.

Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp has heaped praise on Japan international Shinji Kagawa 

Kagawa sealed a move back to Dortmund after failing to hold down a first-team spot at Manchester United 

Klopp, speaking to Uefa's official website, said: 'Shinji is someone who moves so well in the most difficult areas of the pitch, between the two lines of four.

'It's like he is the sausage in a sandwich, because players are coming from all sides.'

The 47-year-old German tactician went on to hail Marco Reus for deciding to reject a big-money move to the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayern Munich.

Klopp added: 'Just how important Marco is, you could see from the extension of his contract. With such a top player, and with our history [financially], you would think a player of his calibre would leave the club at some point.

'But even though the whole world wanted him, he said: "I'm staying here".

'I think that was an extraordinary act at such a young age and not normal, so that's why I think he is a great player and a great lad.'
