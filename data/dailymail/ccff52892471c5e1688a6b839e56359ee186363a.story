He hit an all-time low last week, dumping his fiancée after their wedding invitations had been sent out.

But Rory McIlroy was back on top of the world last night. Rejuvenated by his newly single status, the 25-year-old golfer yesterday spectacularly won his first tournament since announcing the split.

The Northern Irishman won the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth, Surrey, in what commentators described as an 'absolute masterclass' and 'incredible stuff'.

It is not known what his former fiancée, Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki, made of his very sudden return to form – but with her first match in   the French Open tomorrow, she is bound to want to prove a point in return.

From despair, victory: Golfer Rory McIlroy won the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth after splitting from his fiancee last week

Tennis star Caroline Wozniacki had already tried on her bridal dress before her ex-fiance, golfer Rory McIlroy called off their wedding

McIlroy revealed on Wednesday that he had broken up with 23-year-old tennis champion Miss Wozniacki because he was not ready for 'all that marriage   entails'.

After a three year relationship, the multi-millionaire said he got cold feet only after they had sent out invitations to their wedding to family and   friends.

She had reportedly already tried on her wedding dress. 'The problem is mine,' he said. 'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready.

'I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had. Everyone has been through break-ups and it's obviously   very, very difficult.'

At Wentworth yesterday, McIlroy responded by scoring an impressive 14-under total of 274 at the European Tour's flagship event, beating 16 golfers in   the top 50 of the world rankings.

Speaking out: Wozniacki took to Twitter to thank her fans for their support, and perhaps make a subtle dig at her Manchester United supporting ex

It was his first professional win since last December and he hasn't won on the PGA Tour since 2012.

He missed the cut in his past three BMW PGA   Championship starts. The former world number one had been widely expected to perform badly at the championship, considering the tumultuous week he had.

After teeing off, however, he said: 'I have exceeded my expectations so far. I think once you get inside the ropes, you are concentrating on your golf.   It's almost like it's a nice four or five hours of a release in some way just to get everything out of your head apart from doing the job at hand.

'You   can't let your mind wander at all when you're trying to win a golf tournament. It's the hours in the day when you're away from it that are probably a little more difficult. It has been tough.'

McIlroy, who is worth an estimated £28million, proposed in Sydney, on New Year's Day after dating Miss Wozniacki for three years.

He gave her a £98,000 eight-carat diamond engagement ring after the couple watched fireworks from a boat in front of Sydney Opera House.

Split: Tennis star Caroline Wozniacki will play in the French Open tomorrow after golfer Rory McIlroy's 'totally unexpected' break up just days after the couple sent out their wedding invitations

It is thought they were planning to marry at the Rockefeller Centre in New York in a lavish ceremony in November. Miss Wozniacki is due to play her first match at the French Open on Tuesday.

Miss Wozniacki, who grew up in Denmark to Polish parents, last week sent a message to fans saying it was a 'hard time' for her and thanking them for   their support.

She then, somewhat cryptically, added: 'Happy I support Liverpool right now because I know I'll never walk alone.'

The message, which was forwarded thousands of times online, is thought to have been a dig at McIlroy, who is a keen football fan and is known to support   Liverpool's arch rivals Manchester United.

It prompted an overwhelming rush of support among sports fans and other female tennis players, with Serena Williams replying: 'I'll always walk with   you. Friends forever.'  Miss Wozniacki had described herself on Twitter as a 'fiancee, daughter, sister, tennis player' and 'mother to our dog Bruno'.

But, last week, she   removed the word 'fiancee'. Sources close to Miss Wozniacki's family said she is determined to carry on as normal despite her heartbreak.

The former women's world number one, who is worth an estimated £15million, is battling a knee injury as well as the very public humiliation of the   breakdown of her relationship.

'She still wants to play in Paris despite having struggled,' a friend told the Mail. 'It is looking almost certain that she will try to play.'
