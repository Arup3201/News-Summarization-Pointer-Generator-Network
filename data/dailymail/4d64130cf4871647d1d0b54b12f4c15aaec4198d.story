Nathan Hughes may be wrestling with a three-way quandary over national allegiance but there is no doubting his commitment to Wasps, as his wife would confirm.

On the night of his wedding to Ella, back home in Lautoka, Fiji, the 23-year-old No 8 wound up in a pub watching his team-mates in action — thousands of miles and many time zones away. It may not have made sense to his bride but Hughes was determined to watch the club that had ignited his career claim their place in the inaugural European Champions Cup.

He had been given special dispensation to miss the tie against Stade Francais in Paris last May because of his need to be on the far side of the world. ‘Before the fixtures came out, we had planned the date for the wedding,’ said Hughes.

Nathan Hughes proved his dedication to the club by spending his wedding night watching Wasps play 

‘When Dai (Young, Wasps’ director of rugby) said we had a game on May 24, I was a bit nervous about going to ask him if I could miss it.

‘I delayed the flight to Fiji so I could play in the first game, then I went out after that. I watched the second game on TV, after the wedding. It was about 3am in Fiji, so I put my missus to bed and said, “I’m going to the pub to watch the boys play”. 

She asked why I didn’t just watch the replay but I said, “I can’t, I have to see it now”. It was the game which decided whether we made it into Europe (Champions Cup) or not, so I had to watch it and I was so pleased we won.’

The new elite continental tournament will be a fitting arena for Hughes to demonstrate his explosive talent and enhance a soaring reputation. He is already making waves in the Aviva Premiership, having come to Wasps from Auckland as a relative unknown.

Young signed the raw lock-cum-flanker on a hunch, switched him to No 8 and soon found he had a barnstorming replacement for Billy Vunipola, who had moved to Saracens. 

Hughes has been a potent threat to opposition defences with his ball-carrying, off-loading, try-scoring routine, as he demonstrated last Saturday by touching down during a sensational performance at Twickenham.

Yet hockey was his childhood sport and, remarkably, he did not play in a rugby match until six years ago. When he gave it a go, the results were immediate. ‘I started playing hockey aged five and switched to rugby when I was 17,’ said Hughes.

‘At my school in Fiji, we were doing hockey training one day and the rugby coach asked if I wanted to play against a team coming from New Zealand because he didn’t have any locks.

‘I said I didn’t know any rules and all he said was, “Catch the ball, run it straight and if you see an opposition player with the ball, tackle him”. The week after, we played against the school from New Zealand — Kelston. Kelston sent some scouts out and they were impressed with the way I played.

‘That was my first-ever game of rugby. After the game, our coach called me over and the guy (scout) from New Zealand gave me an envelope. 

When I went home, I opened the envelope and it said, “2010 scholarship for Kelston Boy’s School”. I told my dad and he just said, “You don’t even play rugby”. But I showed him all the papers they gave me and he was so surprised.’

One game had brought one big breakthrough and Hughes continued to make rapid progress, from the Kelston 1st XV into the Auckland academy and on into the senior squad to play in the domestic ITM Cup. He was also called up for the New Zealand Sevens squad but held off from accepting while he awaited a Super 15 contract.

That next step up eluded him, so despite being eligible to chase All Blacks selection after three years’ residency, he explored options abroad and Wasps took a chance on him. 

His impact has been so eye-catching that there is now a tussle for his Test services. Fiji and Samoa see him as a potential asset at next year’s World Cup and England are monitoring his development.

Hughes is eligible to play for Fiji, Samoa and could turn out for England in two years time 

Hughes will qualify to wear the Red Rose in 2016 and while he is non-committal for now, it seems he is leaning towards that target. ‘People have been saying, “I think Fiji want you, I think Samoa want you”,’ he said. ‘But they haven’t approached me face to face. The Fiji coach did call to ask if I wanted to play in the summer but I said I couldn’t because I was getting married.

‘My mum is Samoan-Chinese and my dad is part Samoan, part Fijian, so I am majority Samoan but I was born in Fiji and grew up there. I love both countries but it’s about taking my time to make the right decision.

‘I don’t want to make a decision and then regret it later. There are two options and once I qualify (for England) on residency, there will be three. I haven’t heard from England but, if they want me, I have to keep working on my game.’

On Sunday afternoon at Adams Park, Hughes has a prime opportunity to highlight his Test credentials when Wasps face champions Northampton and their outstanding No 8, Samu Manoa. The American is from a Tongan family, with body art depicting their journey to San Francisco.

Hughes is also proud of his Polynesian heritage and wears the ink to prove it, along with a wedding tattoo. ‘The one on the right arm, which goes to my back, is a map of Fiji, to show where I come from,’ he said.

‘On my left arm, the turtle symbolises myself and where I’m from. The tulip is the Dutch flower, so it symbolises my wife — who was born in New Zealand, but her family are Dutch. The design on the left represents the wedding. Most people have a wedding ring but I’ve got a wedding tattoo instead.’
