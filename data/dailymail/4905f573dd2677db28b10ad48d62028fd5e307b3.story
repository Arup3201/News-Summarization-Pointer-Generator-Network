A cat lost one of his nine lives when he plunged 70-foot from a viaduct - and survived.

Bengal cat Gus badly broke a leg when he fell from the viaduct in Frampton Mansell, Gloucestershire, but managed to drag himself to safety under a trailer nearby.

The 18-month-old cat was saved from certain death by maggots which nibbled the necrotising flesh away from his broken leg and prevented blood poisoning.

He was discovered six days after the plunge by a stunned dog walker who called his owner Caroline Bush, 39.

Mrs Bush rushed Gus to Clockhouse Veterinary Hospital in Wallbridge, Glos., where staff were sceptical about his chances of survival. But amazingly, Gus pulled through following an operation to remove his leg and is happily back with his family.

Mrs Bush, who runs as dog walking business with husband Ian, said children Sashi, 10, Fintan, nine, and Orlah, six, were delighted Gus was home.

She said: 'We had a phone call from a gentleman who said, I think your cat is under my trailer. We were on our way to school at the time so we went straight there.

'I helped him out but his leg had rotted away. It just looked like a shrivelled up banana skin.

'The vets said they had never seen an injury that horrific and the animal survive, so they suggested the kids come and say goodbye to him at one point.

'He had gone six days without food or water and was so weak they had to wait a day before operating.

'When they did amputate his leg he died but thankfully they were able to bring him back to life by resuscitating him.

'They told us the maggots that had been feeding on his leg saved his life, as they had eaten all the dead flesh and prevented him from getting blood poisoning.'

Mrs Bush added that Gus had become a 'local celebrity' in Frampton Mansell, where the family live.

She added: 'We were so glad to have him back - he has become a bit of a local celebrity around here now.

'Everyone seems to know about him and they keeping asking us, was your cat the one that fell off the viaduct?'
