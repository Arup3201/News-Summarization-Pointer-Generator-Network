Labour is today cast as the ‘Downton Abbey party’ which refuses to back opportunities for poorer people which have been enjoyed by the political elite.

Education Secretary Michael Gove is to use a speech to accuse Ed Miliband of reacting to the idea of increasing the aspirations of students with the ‘horror’ of the Earl of Grantham in the ITV drama to the news that a chauffeur wanted to marry his daughter.

In a surprise reversal of class-based political attacks, Mr Gove will claim Labour believes working class pupils should ‘stick to their station in life’ and not enjoy the elite Oxford education enjoyed by the party’s leadership.

Labour leader Ed Miliband's reaction to raising 
aspirations for working class students is likened to when Downton's Earl
 of Grantham learned his daughter wanted to marry a chauffeur

In a speech to the Social Market 
Foundation tonight, Mr Gove will defend the Government’s English 
Baccalaureate measure, which recognised students who secured at least a C
 grade in English, Maths, two sciences, a language and a humanities 
subject.

The measurement, 
introduced two years ago, had been greeted with ‘visceral horror’ from 
the Labour party and the unions, he is expected to say.

‘How
 dare anyone - let alone the Department for Education - reveal how many 
state school students were getting the sort of education that enables 
the children of the rich to dominate British life?’

The eBacc inspired opposition ‘because it revealed how poorly served so many state students were’, he will say.

Mr
 Gove claims the attitude among the Labour leadership is like that of 
the landed gentry in ITV’s landed gentry, who do not believe that the 
working classes and the servants should enjoy the same privileges that 
they do.

He will contrast the privileged 
education of Mr Miliband, shadow chancellor Ed Balls and shadow 
education secretary Stephen Twigg who all studied Philosophy, Politics 
and Economics at Oxford with the lack of ambition for students from 
poorer backgrounds.

And he 
will draw on the explosive storyline when the Earl of Grantham 
discovered  Lady Sybil was running away to marry Irish chauffeur Tom 
Branson.

‘At the moment just
 16 per cent of students in the state sector secure the EBacc. Only 23 
per cent are even entered for it. More than three-quarters of state 
school students have been denied access to the qualifications which will
 empower them to choose their own path,’ he will say.

‘But for Labour that’s not only no cause for concern – it’s a truth which should be suppressed.

‘The
 current leadership of the Labour Party react to the idea that working 
class students might study the subjects they studied with the same 
horror that the Earl of Grantham showed when a chauffeur wanted to marry
 his daughter. 

‘Labour, under their current leadership, want to be the Downton Abbey party when it comes to educational opportunity.

‘They
 think working class children should stick to the station in life they 
were born into – they should be happy to be recognised for being good 
with their hands and not presume to get above themselves.’

The ITV drama was rocked by the revelation that aristocrat Lady Sybil had fallen in love with Irish chauffeur Tom Branson

Mr Gove will say that claims of ‘rapid and relentless educational improvement’ under Labour which saw GCSE results soar have been ‘shown up as a far more complex narrative of inequality and untapped potential’.

He will add: ‘But instead of using this information to demand that poorer children at last enjoy the education expected by the privileged, far too many on the left attacked the very idea that poor children might aspire to such an entitlement.’

Labour hit back tonight, insisting there remains widespread opposition to the plans.

Mr Twigg said: 'Michael Gove is clearly rattled by the widespread opposition to his EBacc exams. Instead of lecturing others, he should listen to business leaders, entrepreneurs, headteachers and parents who think his plans are backward looking and narrow.

'We need to get young people ready for a challenging and competitive world of work, not just dwell on the past.'
