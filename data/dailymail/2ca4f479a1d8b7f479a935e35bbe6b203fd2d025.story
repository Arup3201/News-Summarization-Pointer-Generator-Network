Defiant: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said he will take on Strasbourg judges on prisoner IVF ban

Chris Grayling last night pledged to face down Strasbourg human rights judges and stop prisoners getting IVF at taxpayers’ expense.

In a highly combative move, the Justice Secretary made clear he wants a ban on convicts accessing costly fertility treatment from behind bars.

The European Court of Human Rights has ruled blocking prisoners’ access to treatment may breach their right to a ‘private and family life’.

Since a 2007 case involving a British killer, 13 inmates have demanded the right to father children, citing the decision.

In 2011, one application was approved by then Prisons  Minister Crispin Blunt.

But today Mr Grayling, a critic of human rights rulings, told the Daily Mail: ‘I am extremely concerned about prisoners having access to  artificial insemination, which is why I am reviewing the policy with a view to banning it.

‘There can be no clearer example of why we need changes to the human rights framework.’

In December, the Mail revealed five life prisoners, four murderers and a drug dealer, had made applications to the Ministry of Justice for fertility treatment. The decision on what happens ultimately rests with the Justice Secretary.

Two of the five have already been refused, while the remainder are still in the system.

Any ban would inevitably end up back in the courts and test ministers’ resolve to stand up to Strasbourg.

It might also mean compensation for inmates who are refused IVF under the ban.

But critics say ministers could simply refuse to pay out and let the Council of Europe – the court’s governing body – decide what action to take.

The 2007 ruling in the case of convicted killer Kirk Dickson led to rule changes making it easier for IVF to be approved.

Dickson and a friend kicked to death George Askins, 41, in 1995 for a few cigarettes.

He was handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 15 years, but met wife Lorraine in a prison penpal scheme.

She was also a convict,  sentenced to 12 months in 1999 for a £20,000 benefit fraud.

They married while he was behind bars, and officials refused to authorise her access to a sperm donation from him for IVF treatment.

In 2001 then Home Secretary David Blunkett rejected their application on the grounds any child would be without a father for much of its childhood. He also said there was a need to maintain public confidence in prison as a punishment.

Using legal aid, Dickson appealed – losing in every court in England. But Strasbourg set aside ministers’ arguments.

The court said his rights had been breached under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to a private and family life, and awarded £18,000 damages.

Perversely, the decision makes it more likely IVF  treatment will be given to inmates who commit the most heinous crimes, as they spend longer locked up.

Mr Grayling has said he wants to ‘curtail’ the powers of the Strasbourg court and return it to the vision of its founders, who were reacting to the  horrors of Nazism.

He has also criticised the court’s decision to demand an end to the ban on prisoners having the vote.

Last year he said: ‘I don’t believe the originators of the Convention on Human Rights ever imagined it being used for things like this.’
