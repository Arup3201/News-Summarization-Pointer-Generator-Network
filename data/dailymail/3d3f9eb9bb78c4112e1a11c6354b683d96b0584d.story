Nick Easter was quickly dragged down to earth after his memorable England comeback earlier this month – with a fine for failing to practise what he preaches at Wimbledon RFC.

The 36-year-old Harlequins No 8 has taken on the role of first-team coach at the London & South East Division One club this season. A return to Test rugby in Cardiff – where he made his first international appearance since the 2011 World Cup – was not about to stop him being on hand to shout orders to his players the next day.

After a dash back from the Welsh capital to England’s Surrey HQ, Easter made it in time to oversee a resounding home win over Havant. ‘I arrived just in time for the warm-up,’ he said. ‘We got the coach back to Pennyhill Park and I drove into the rugby club just as they were starting the warm-up.

The 36-year-old has been gearing up for England's next RBS 6 Nations match against Ireland 

‘I don’t think they expected to see me, but the manager said it was a little bit of a lift for them for me to turn up. I was barking orders straight away! They won 45-0.

‘I really enjoy it down there. It is a good group of lads and they are willing to learn. It reminds you of what rugby is all about. None of the players are paid, obviously. There is a club house and muddy pitches that you go and coach on, on a Tuesday and Thursday. You try and get the best out of them and we are enjoying a successful year. Everyone is enjoying themselves.’

On Easter’s watch, Wimbledon are on a roll – currently top of their league table with 16 wins from 19 matches. But his positive impact didn’t stop him from facing the music, after his accidental obstruction had denied England a late try in Cardiff.

‘I got fined,’ he said. ‘We had a fining session last week and the 2nd-team coach said, “Everyone has been drilled to make sure they time their decoy runs right and make sure they’re an option”. Obviously I got penalised for that for Dave Attwood’s disallowed try in Cardiff, so I was up before the beak.’

Easter was part of the England side which lost 24-8 to Ireland at the Aviva Stadium back in March 2011

Now that Easter has become the oldest try-scorer in RBS Six Nations history and proved to himself that he can withstand the ferocity of Test rugby at the age of 36, he has a score to settle in Dublin.

Four years ago, the Harlequins No 8 was the last Englishman to lift the championship trophy – but it was a surreal ceremony in the lobby of a hotel, after Martin Johnson’s team had been beaten 24-8 by Ireland, to dash their Grand Slam hopes. Easter is back in the Red Rose ranks and he is desperate for another shot at the title-chasing Irish on March 1.

‘Hopefully, I will be involved against Ireland because there are a few wrongs to put right after 2011,’ he said. ‘Wig (Graham Rowntree, England forwards coach) was around then, as well as a few other guys – Dylan, Coley, Ben Youngs. It was a long time ago. The important thing this week is it will be a cracking game, with a big build-up, but we have two weeks’ preparation.

‘Back then – and I’m not using this as an excuse – I think we played Scotland the previous Sunday and then had six days to prepare. We just didn’t do it in 2011. It wasn’t because of the six-day turn-around, I think it's because we forgot what it takes to get a result in tough places like that.

‘But this time we have two weeks to prepare, so we can get back up to the same level we were at going to Cardiff. Training will be pretty intense.’

England's Easter, pictured driving with the ball, has said he wants to put things right after previous defeat 

That intensity will suit Easter just fine. Since his recall to the England squad last month, he has felt at home as the senior player. Asked if he feels his body can cope with taking part in another World Cup, he said: ‘I’m even more convinced now. I only played 10 minutes in Cardiff and 25 against Italy. It is very different if you start a game, but I have no issues whatsoever.’

His try against Italy was his first for the national team since he touched down on November 15, 2008, against Australia. ‘It was a long time ago,’ he said. Easter has spoken of having ‘unfinished business’ in Test rugby, but admitted that the satisfaction of returning to the England fold would be tempered by poor results.

So far, however, he has played a cameo role in back-to-back wins. Now he will prepare for the next trip to Dublin, full of hope and expectation. ‘It is about winning,’ he said. ‘There is no reason we shouldn’t if we get everything right, with the resources we have got and the players we have.’
