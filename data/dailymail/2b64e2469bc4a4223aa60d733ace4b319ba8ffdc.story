It's the stuff of nightmares. 

A man frantically bounds from roof-to-roof, running from a pack of blood-thirsty zombies.

Thankfully, this is not the apocalypse, but a white-knuckle point-of-view video, featuring a Parkour athlete dramatically scaling walls and leaping between buildings.

Inspired by the highly-anticipated action survival game, Dying Light, the video is shot from the point-of-view of a Parkour athlete, charting his frantic escape from zombies, over the rooftops of Cambridge.

Its director, Scott Bass, 23,  told MailOnline: 'I wanted to have something that took the viewer on a whirlwind parkour experience, but finish in a way that felt true to the tone of the game.

No injuries occured while filming the Parkour scences - but there was an incident when one cast member was eating while walking down the stairs

'I’ve been involved in Parkour since 2005, and pursuing it professionally since 2010. I usually work as a director for films involving parkour, but also as photographer and consultant from time to time.' 

The dramatic video was shot over three days in the director's home town. Bass explained: 'Collectively, I felt we all knew Cambridge best for this film. Its the closest looking city to the game I could think of, and I had a lot of confidence in scouting out locations that I knew we could work with.'

'We had to battle the weather and light a bit, as we shot last november. We had quite a lot of rain during the shoot, and you can see plenty of puddles in the film because of this.' 

Well-known Parkour athlete Toby Segar stars as the hero, who is chased through the streets of Cambridge

Hands off: In a dramatic moment, one of the video's blood-thirsty zombies grabs the hero's crotch

'We had Toby Segar as the hero zombie, and Alex Potts, Phil Doyle and Neil Cointet rounded out my zombie cast. They’re all very talented and well known Parkour athletes, so I had a bit of an all-star crew really.' 

'I think my favourite moment is around 2:15, where the zombie jumps at the hero and grabs at his… crotch. It was planned the zombie would grab at the hero, but it just happened to be that he grabbed there. 

'I actually liked the authenticity of the take and knew it would be something that viewers would want to comment on, so I left it in. 

'We had one small injury where one of the guys was eating while walking down stairs during a location move, but nothing from parkour! These guys are so highly trained in their movement, its always the little things that get them.'
