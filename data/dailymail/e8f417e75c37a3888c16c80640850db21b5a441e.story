Maria Sharapova has swapped the court for the stands at a tennis match - but luckily for her, she won't have time to get used to it.

Fresh from winning the French Open, the 27-year-old sports star took a well-deserved break today to watch her boyfriend claim a stunning victory just a week before Wimbledon.

Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, 23, beat Spaniard Feliciano Lopez in the men's singles final of the AEGON Championships at the Queen's Club in Kensington, west London.

Delight: Maria Sharapova swapped the court for the stands when she watched her boyfriend and world No 13 Grigor Dimitrov triumph in the AEGON Championships at the Queen's Club in Kensington, west London

Windswept: Sharapova and her boyfriend have their eyes set hungrily on Wimbledon, which starts on June 23

The weather was not ideal for a summer
 of tennis, with Sharapova keeping warm in an outdoor coat as the wind 
whipped up around the fiercely-concentrating fans.

But
 otherwise she was the perfect picture of a spectator, clasping her 
hands together as she focused on Dimitrov's tie-break win - his third 
title on three surfaces in the last four months.

While
 her boyfriend is ranked the world No 13, Sharapova is the women's No 5,
 and both have their sights hungrily set on Wimbledon.

The
 world's most famous tennis championships begin in south west London on 
June 23 and will see Andy Murray defending the men's singles title which
 he won to national celebration last year.

The
 focus will not be solely on the tennis. As a world star and 2004 
singles champion, Sharapova will also be using her name for a pop-up 
sweet shop called Sugarpova near the All England Club.

Dimitrov saved one 
match point on his way to a 6-7 (8-10), 7-6 (7-1), 7-6 (8-6) victory in today's match.

His opponent Lopez, though nine years his senior, was a formidable one - and counts Andy Murray's mother Judy among his fans.

The
 highly-rated player had long been tipped for a grand slam winning 
future, and was set to attack Wimbledon with increased hope.

Dimotrov had dispatched top-seed Stan Wawrinka in the semi-finals and will prove a popular champion in Kensington.

Britain's
 24-year wait for a doubles champion at Queen's continues, however, after Jamie 
Murray and John Peers were unable to topple second seeds Alexander Peya 
and Bruno Soares.

Sealed with a kiss: Dimitrov's win was a big boost for the 23-year-old ahead of Wimbledon in a week's time

Jumping for joy: Dimitrov fought about from a set down to win second and third set tie breaks

Down low: Dimitrov reaches for a low ball as he fights back at Queen's Club

Advantage: Lopez, whose fans include Andy Murray's mother, won the first set but was unable to press home

Jeremy Bates remains Britain's last doubles title-winner at the Queen's Club Aegon Championships, back in 1990.

Neil Broad made the final in 1993, and Murray had impressed in being the first Brit to follow suit.

Murray
 and Peers saw off top seeds Bob and Mark Bryan en route to the final, 
but were unable to repeat that giant-killing when silverware was on the 
line.
