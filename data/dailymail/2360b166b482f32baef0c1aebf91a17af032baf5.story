It is supposedly the next great technological leap forward that will carry us all into a brighter tomorrow – the ‘wearable computer’ that will revolutionise our daily lives.

But will Google Glass be able to tell us if our flight is running late, whether there are traffic delays on the way to the airport, and where our lost bags have ended up?

Faces of the future: Staff at Copenhagen Airport try Google Glass devices for size

They may well if the airline industry follows the example set by Copenhagen Airport.

The main transport hub in the Danish capital has stepped into the future after becoming the first airport in the world to equip its staff with Google Glass.

The experiment was conducted earlier this month, and declared a success by the airport’s operational team, who found that it assisted in the job of looking after the 62,000 passengers who pass through the complex’s four terminals every day.

‘The feedback from our passengers and service team has been overwhelmingly positive,’ says the airport’s Marie-Louise Lotz.

‘We found Google Glass very easy to use, and more user-friendly than other devices such as tablets.

‘We can reduce the amount of paper our managers need to carry, such as duty rosters, desk allocation sheets, peak prognosis, passenger numbers and cruise arrivals.

‘And because the devices are hands-free, our managers are not focusing on a screen and can engage better with our passengers.’

A leap forward, maybe: Reaction to the devices among passengers varied according to age group

The devices are not yet available for passengers to use, but the airport hopes that they will be introduced on a wider basis at some point in the future – although there were also concerns about certain shortcomings in the technology.

‘The devices need improved scanning capability, battery life and reduced heating during operation,’ says Jim Peters of SITA, a technology firm which works with the air industry.

‘But the potential for widespread usage in the air transport industry is great.

‘SITA will continue testing and researching the best ways for this innovative technology to be embraced by airports and airlines.’

Reaction from passengers at Copenhagen Airport was mixed.

Younger travellers recognised the Google Glass devices, and were positive about their implications. But older passengers were often unaware of the wearable items until they were pointed out to them – although they liked the concept when they were given details.

Changing times: Google Glass has been available to the public since May - but is still expensive

‘The pilot was very promising,’ says the airport’s Christian Poulsen.

‘We are now investigating how we could efficiently introduce wearable technology to our passenger services team.’

Google Glass has been available to the public since May, although the price – US$1500 (£1100) may still be considered prohibitive to the casual buyer.
