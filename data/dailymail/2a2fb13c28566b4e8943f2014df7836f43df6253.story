Payout: Rugby league star Keith Mason, 31, pictured, has been awarded almost £150,000 in damages after Super League club Huddersfield Giants sacked him when a naked picture of his teammate was posted online

A rugby league star has been awarded almost £150,000 in damages after Super League club Huddersfield Giants sacked him when a naked picture of his teammate was posted online.

Former prop Keith Mason, 31, was dismissed from the team on grounds of gross misconduct last October after a picture of a fellow player's bottom appeared on Twitter.

Throughout the three-day High Court battle in Leeds, Mr Mason, who claimed wrongful dismissal, maintained his former club wanted to get rid of him because of his expensive contract and that the Twitter picture was only a smokescreen.

His Honour Judge Andrew Saffman ruled in favour of the player and has now awarded him £146,000 in damages.

After the hearing, Mr Mason said he was going to Los Angeles with his boxing friend Joe Calzaghe to celebrate.

He said: 'It’s been a stressful time and I’m glad it’s over. I will go away, enjoy myself, relax and re-charge my batteries.

'I am still in great shape and training every day and I want to move on in my career. But first I’m off to celebrate.'

Mr Mason, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire., was sacked a few weeks after a picture of then teammate Scott Moore’s bottom was posted on his Twitter account where it stayed for around 48 hours.

The court heard that the photograph was taken as the team celebrated after the final game of last season during a three-day 'communal bender' known in the rugby league world as ‘Mad Monday’.

The club, even though it admitted it was posted without Mr Mason’s knowledge, said he brought them into disrepute by not deleting it soon enough.

After playing seven seasons for the club, Mr Mason was fired with nearly three years left on his contract.

The player claimed he was sacked by the club to free up space in the salary cap for new signings.

At the time of his dismissal the rugby ace was one of the team’s highest paid players, with a yearly salary of £95,000. 

The total figure including legal costs will leave the West Yorkshire club - currently leading Super League - with a debt of around £400,000 - as Mr Mason’s legal fees are estimated to be £200,000.

The club will also have to pay their own legal fees of at least £50,000. It was also revealed that Mr Mason had offered to settle just days before the case went to court - for £100,000. But the Giants responded with a paltry offer of £5,000.

Ruling in Mr Mason’s favour last month, the judge said: 'When all is is said and done the claimant was employed as a rugby player.

'I’m not convinced that this Tweet can been seen to be inextricably linked to the club.

'I think it is very unlikely that anyone seeing this Tweet would assume that the Tweet is condoned by the club.

'Therefore I have no difficulty in finding the claimant has established on balance that this was a wrongful dismissal.

'I am satisfied that the club was keen for the claimant to go. But this was not an unhappy player. He did not want to go, he wanted to stay.'

The court hearing yesterday also heard that the Giants only disclosed vital documents by court order days before the case began.

The documents related to who had made complaints about the Twitter picture and about details of the signings of other players.

Judge Saffman said the documents were 'clearly embarrassing' and should have been handed over at the outset.

He said: 'On balance I am entitled to assume that these documents were deliberately not disclosed and, if that’s not the case, then significant efforts were not made (to find them) until the last minute.'

Mason’s counsel said he was entitled to ‘indemnity costs’ because of the club’s “dismissive attitude” to the case.

The judge ordered the club to pay Mr Mason’s £146,510 in damages within seven days.

The club had previously been told to make a down-payment of £35,000 towards the legal fees but this was paid several days late.

The judge ordered a further £5,000 to be paid. The exact costs have yet to be finalised.

After the hearing, Mr Mason’s solicitor Richard Cramer confirmed his client had been on a ‘no-win, no-fee’ arrangement, which means a win bonus of between £75,000 and £100,000 payable on top of his £98,000 legal fees.

Mr Cramer said: 'It has been a resounding win and Keith has been vindicated in taking the action he did. Keith has only done what he is entitled to do and I hope Huddersfield Giants comply with the court order.

'The indemnity order sent a clear message that the judge was disatisfied with the way Huddersfield conducted the case by trying to conceal significant documents.'

Mason, who is coming to the end of a 12-month deal at Castleford Tigers, said he wanted to stay a Super League player.

Giants managing director Richard Thewlis declined to comment.
