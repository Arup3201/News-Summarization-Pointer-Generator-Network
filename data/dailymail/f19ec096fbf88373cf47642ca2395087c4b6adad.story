Westminster Abbey is to add a £19million Gothic tower - its first new building in 270 years - as part of major plans to create a new museum and exhibition space.

The tower will allow public access to the Abbey's eastern Triforium gallery, which will be turned into a museum called The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries. 

Exhibits will include a selection of treasures, including royal funeral effigies, silverware and stonework. The 14th century Liber Regalis manuscript and a crimson velvet cope worn by the Dean of Westminster at Charles II's coronation will also be on display.

The project is the most significant addition to the fabric of the Abbey church since the construction of Nicholas Hawksmoor's west towers in 1745. It is expected to open in early 2018 after Westminster council approved the plans this week. 

The Triforium  gallery runs 70 feet above the floor of the Abbey and around almost all its internal walls. When Henry III began to rebuild the Abbey church in the 13th century, he planned to house chapels at the east end of the Triforium, but the idea was never followed through.

Plans to open up the gallery will give visitors views along the whole length of the Abbey  and create a new and much larger museum and an exhibition space. 

The tower, which will reflect the Gothic architecture of the Abbey church, will be 'substantial but largely hidden from view' and 'should be entirely in keeping with the historic fabric of the Abbey', according to a statement released online last year. 

It has been designed by the Abbey's Surveyor of the Fabric, consultant architect, Ptolemy Dean.  

The Very Rev John Hall, the Dean of Westminster, said: 'We are delighted that our proposals for the new tower and for opening the eastern Triforium to the public have the support of Westminster City Council, reflecting that of our local community and of other bodies concerned for the preservation of the local and national heritage.

'This planning approval will enable us to approach with confidence the final stages of the necessary fund-raising and drive us towards the timely completion and opening of The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries, the most exciting development of the Abbey building for over 250 years.'

Famous writers including Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy and Rudyard Kipling are buried in the 900-year-old Abbey, as well as 17 monarchs.

Robert Davis, deputy leader of Westminster City Council, said: 'In a city full of spectacular buildings, Westminster Abbey stands out not only for its architectural merit but for the fundamental role it plays in our cultural and civic life.

'I am certain that this new tower, which will give people access to some of the abbey's previously hidden treasures, will be an attractive and successful addition to the city's heritage.' 

Much of the present building was built during the reign of King Henry III. In 1245 he pulled down the eastern part of the 11th century Abbey, which had been founded by King Edward the Confessor and dedicated in 1065. 

It is said that Henry's devotion to St Edward later prompted him to build a more magnificent church in the newest Gothic style, and also to provide a new shrine for the Saint.

The architect was  influenced by the new cathedrals that had been built in Reims, Amiens and Chartres at the time, and used characteristic Gothic features of pointed arches, ribbed vaulting and rose windows in his design.

The Abbey has the highest Gothic vault in England - nearly 102 feet - and the narrow aisles were made to make it seem even higher.

By 1269 the apse, radiating chapels, transepts and choir were complete and the new shrine received the bones of St Edward on 13 October.

The next major addition to the building was the construction of a new Lady Chapel by Henry VII between 1503 and 1519 to replace the 13th century chapel. The architecture in this part of the Abbey contrasts with the rest and no records for this building have been found. 

The last phase of building was the completion in 1745 of the West Towers in Portland stone, to a design by Nicholas Hawksmoor, the Abbey's Surveyor.

The new power is expected to open in early 2018 after Westminster council approved the plans this week.
