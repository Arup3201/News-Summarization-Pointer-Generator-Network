The family of one-punch victim Daniel Christie, who died after being hit to the head, have spoken out against the relaxed drinking laws for this year's New Years Eve.

Daniel Christie, 18, was allegedly knocked unconscious with a single blow to the head by martial arts fighter Shaun McNeil in Sydney's Kings Cross on New Year's Eve last year.

'I am disappointed that in spite of all these good things that have happened, the government is now saying, 'because it's improved, relax it',' said Daniel's father, Michael Christie.

'Because we aren't all getting killed on the roads are we going to up the speed limit? It just doesn't make common sense,' he told The Sun Herald.

The teenager died after 11 days on life support, contributing towards the introduction of stricter lockout laws in NSW, preventing entry to venues after 1.30am and no alcohol served after 3am.

On New Year's Eve the laws will be relaxed in Sydney's CBD to 3am, a ruling which Mr Christie says sends the wrong message.

Despite Mr Christie's concerns, Deputy Premier Troy Grant said that the relaxed drinking rules had the support of the family of teenager Thomas Kelly, who died in 2012 from a punch to the head.

Mr Grant said that safety was the priority of the NSW Police, and the City of Sydney, who also backed the decision.

'We recognise people want to celebrate the start of the new year but we also want to maintain there will be no change to the last drinks at 3am or the tough measures we have implemented to protect the community,' said Mr Grant.

The laws have been introduced to reduce street congestion and public transport pressure following the fireworks display at midnight, but only apply for the night.

People will be able to enter venues until 3am, though the no-take-away law still applies after 10pm. 

Former premier Barry O'Farrell said the new laws, which included a curfew on trading hours to 3am across the city, sent out 'the possible strongest message' that drug and alcohol-fuelled violence will no longer be tolerated.

Mr Christie's death was one of several attacks that sparked new laws introduced to help curb alcohol-fueled attacks

Under the new laws anyone convicted of reckless grievous bodily harm or wounding a member of the public or a police officer while intoxicated can expect a minimum sentence of three to five years and a maximum penalty of up to 16 years.

There has been a drop in alcohol-related assaults in licensed venues by 40% since the introduction of the laws, reported The Sun Herald. 

Mr Christie said that the objections to the ruling did not come from a place of bitterness, and that the family did not 'hate' Ms McNeil for allegedly causing the death of Daniel. 

Around the CBD there will also be heightened security following the spate of terror threats, with counter-terrorism agents working around the city.

Assistant Police Commissioner Michael Fuller said it was not uncommon for authorities to be involved in New Year's Eve celebrations.
