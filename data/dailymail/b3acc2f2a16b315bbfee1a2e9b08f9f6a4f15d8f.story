Shane Sutton wants his British cycling team to be ‘Rio ready’ by January 1, 2015, which makes this weekend’s track cycling World Cup in London perfectly timed.

Some of the signs are worrying, however. If the Rio Olympic Games were to begin on January 1, then there would arguably be only one event that Team GB would start as clear favourites: the women’s team pursuit.

Led by the biggest star of the current team, Laura Trott, they have suffered just three defeats since the event was inaugurated at the 2008 world championships in Manchester. For the past four years they have established a 100 per cent record and in the London velodrome on Friday evening they extended that, racing to victory over Australia.

Across the whole squad, there seems little doubt the British team are feeling the absence of Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, the talismanic figures who retired in 2012 after each starring in two Olympic Games and contributing to the haul of 16 gold medals.

The difficulty for Sutton, who replaced Sir Dave Brailsford as performance director in April, is in trying to maintain such dominance. ‘It’s all about continuous improvement,’ said Sutton of the squad’s philosophy, ‘so we’d like to think success would follow.

‘However, life goes in cycles,’ he added. ‘You have a talent pool and sometimes that gets saturated. I wouldn’t say we have a massive amount of talent but I do think we have the tools in the toolbox to do the job in Rio.’

The shallowness of the talent pool only accentuates the importance of Trott, the 22-year old from Essex who won two gold medals at London 2012. She will be 24 in Rio, 28 in Tokyo and could go on to 2024 and beyond. 

Pendleton was 27 when she won her first Olympic title, Hoy 28 when he claimed the first of his six gold medals, so it is far from inconceivable that Trott might succeed Hoy as Britain’s most decorated Olympian.

Trott is fortunate to be surrounded by strong team-mates, with the emergence of Scotland’s Katie Archibald over the last 12 months bolstering the team pursuit squad.

But as Trott admitted on Friday evening, after the latest win, the competition is getting tougher all the time. ‘It’s getting harder,’ she said. ‘You definitely feel the pressure now.’

Today, Trott will go for a second World Cup gold medal in the omnium, which would repeat her double success at London 2012. She has something beyond mere talent that allows her to connect with the crowd and gets them behind her. The feeling is mutual. ‘I absolutely love it here,’ said Trott.

‘It’s nice to know they are totally behind you. You can hear them going absolutely nuts. It’s that spirit and energy that carries you around the track.’

If the women have Trott to lead the line, the men should have Sir Bradley Wiggins, who has promised to return for Rio. His presence will certainly lift a team pursuit squad who battled to a gold medal on Friday evening after perennial rivals Australia punctured in their semi-final.
