Desperate to burn the calories but really can't be bothered to leave your bed? The latest Hollywood craze might be just the ticket.

Bulk perspiration, which involves being wrapped in something akin to an extremely hot electric blanket that promises to burn 1,000 calories a session, is fast becoming a weight loss sensation in LA.

According to The Mirror, the 'urban sweat lodges' are frequented by the likes of Demi Moore and the Kardashians.

The hour-long session, which costs £30, sees you wrapped up in a padded infrared foil blanket which is slowly heated to 75C - that's twice the temperature of the Saudi Arabian desert.

But how does it work?

'Infrared energy produces a uniform deep heat penetration without the usual sensation of feeling hot. This is achieved by using a specific Infrared band of energy peaking at around 9.4 micons; a level designed to penetrate beyond the skin (where heat is most acutely felt) to a depth where fat resides,' reads the Shape House's website, a salon offering the treatment in LA.

'As this subcutaneous fat begins to heat, your body begins to thermo-regulate itself by producing sweat.

'And in the process of sweating, the multiple benefits are achieved… detoxing, skin conditioning, cardio fitness, relaxation, weight loss, and emotional health.'

Sophie Chiche, founder of the Shape House in Larchmont, Los Angeles, told the paper: 'This technology was originally used in France helping to fuse broken bones. But people found they slept better and their skin and digestion improved.

'It burns a lot of calories, not just from water loss, but because the body, heated to 70-75 degrees, is tricked into thinking it has a fever.

'So as the temperature goes up, up and up, the body tries to go down, down, down. This requires a lot of energy.

'Toxins are stored as a layer of fat 
protecting your organs. By sweating, you lose toxins and your body no 
longer needs this barrier and the water we retain from stress is 
removed.'

Sophie, who once 
weighed 23st, swears by the method herself. In eight years, she has lost
 11st, which she claims is down to her sessions three times a week.

Thanks
 to the Kardashians, who paid a visit to the Shape House in their hit 
reality show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, there is a lengthy 
waiting list.

But does it work and, most importantly, is it safe?

Dr Marilyn Glenville PhD, nutritionist specialising in women's health from www.marilynglenville.com, said: 'A sweat lodge has been traditionally used as an ancient ceremony for centuries. It was used for marriages, births, death anything where there was a new beginning or change in life.

'But it is very different from the urban sweat lodge suggested here. In a traditional sweat lodge hot stones are used and it is the steam that comes from the rocks that is supposed to help clear out toxins.

The urban sweat lodge is not using steam but the equivalent of an electric blanket (using infrared) to heat up the body. There will be contraindications for some people who have heart problems, high blood pressure, during menstruation and in pregnancy.

'But my biggest concern is that if people are using it for weight loss, it is not changing any of the unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as eating unhealthy foods and not exercising. So people are looking at it as a quick fix.'
