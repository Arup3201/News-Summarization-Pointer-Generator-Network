Arriving back on American soil after a pioneering operation the world’s first ever transsexual was captured on camera by the renowned film company British Pathe.

Christine Jorgenson underwent gender reassignment in Denmark in 1953 
and was the first person to go public after the surgery.

She is seen here at the age of 26 in archive footage that was recently posted on the website of the historic newsreel company to mark the 60 year anniversary of the operation.

The black and white clip is billed as “GI” CHRISTINE RETURNS HOME and shows Jorgenson being greeted by a huge pack of cameramen as she arrives back at an airport in the USA. 

She was born as the son of a carpenter and grew up in New York’s tough Bronx district.

A plummy-voiced narrator tells viewers: 'A 26 year old ex GI arrives home from Denmark where doctors converted him into a woman. Two years ago the name was George Jorgenson. Today it is Christine.'

Wearing a matching fur coat and hat Christine holds a cigarette while a reporter attempts to interview her.

She nervously answers a few questions before being seemingly over-awed by the attention.

She tells the cameramen: 'I don’t have any plans at the moment, and I thank you all for coming, but I think it is too much.'

Despite her initial discomfort in front of the cameras, Christine later became a famous spokesperson for transgender people and toured universities and colleges to talk about her life.

A spokeswoman for British Pathe said: 'To mark the 60th anniversary of sex change operations, we put up a clip of Christine Jorgenson being interviewed in 1953 on her return to New York.   

'Christine had been born George Jorgenson and was one of the first to have a sex change using surgery and hormone replacement therapy.

'The story caused a sensation and amongst the media scrum, the Pathe cameras caught a brief interview with Christine. Interestingly, we also have a clip of Christine receiving the woman of the year award in 1953 for her contribution to science.

'Even though it was 60 years ago, the clips show a tolerance and progressive interest in sex change.'

Before joining the army in 1945 she attended photography college, and in later life she also worked as an actress and a singer. Her stage act initially included changing into Wonder Woman, but she was asked to stop using the costume by the character’s copyright owner.

Christine died in 1989.

Christine's story:

George
Jorgensen shocked the nation in December 1952 by returning from a trip 
to Denmark as a 27-year-old woman named Christine.

Wrapped
in a fur coat with eyelashes long, cheekbones high and full lips 
painted red, Christine resembled nothing of the young man she had been 
when she departed.

Jorgensen was one of the first patients to undergo both surgery and hormone therapy to change her gender, according to the BBC.

'Ex-GI becomes blonde beauty!' one U.S. headline declared as the news broke.

Jorgensen
had a happy childhood, growing up in the Bronx in a close-knit family. 
But as she reached adolescence, she became convinced she had been born 
into the wrong body - that of a man instead of a woman.

'The
young Jorgensen never identified himself with homosexuality but rather 
as a woman who happened to be in a man's body,' Teit Ritzau, a Danish 
doctor and documentary maker who got to know Christine Jorgensen when he
made a film about her in the 1980s, told the British broadcaster.

While
living as George, Christine said in her autobiography that she felt 
physically sick when men approached her, despite being attracted to 
them.

But in the late 1940s, after a 
short career in the military, Jorgensen read about Christian Hamburger, a
Danish doctor who was experimenting with sex change therapy using 
animals to test hormones.

She booked her ticket to Copenhagen in 1950, convincing her Danish-born parents she intended to visit relatives.

'I
was a bit nervous because there were too many people at that period who
insisted I was crazy,' Jorgensen recalled years after the operation. 
'But Dr Hamburger didn't feel there was anything particularly strange 
about it.'

Dr
Hamburger quickly diagnosed Jorgensen as transsexual and prescribed her
a long course of female hormones, encouraging her to take on a female 
identity for the first time and to start wearing women's clothing in 
public.

'The
first sign was an increase in size of the mammary glands and then hair 
began to grow where the patient had a bald patch on the temple,' he 
later said, according to the BBC.

'Finally the whole body changed from a male to a female shape.'

Psychologist Dr Georg Sturup assessed Christine and was quickly convinced that she knew what she was doing.

To
proceed, Dr Sturup successfully persuaded the Danish government to 
allow castration for such medical purposes. It had previously been 
outlawed.

After
taking the female hormones for more than a year, Jorgensen underwent 
the first of a number of operations to transform her genitals from male 
to female.

It
is unclear exactly what Dr Hamburger and his team did during the 
surgeries but, according to the BBC, it's likely they followed the lead 
set by a group of surgeons several decades earlier.

The
first attempt at a modern sex change is believed to have taken place as
early as the 1930s in Berlin on a patient known as Lili Elbe.

It,
however, was unsuccessful and Elbe died of complications during one of 
the operations. But the medical notes the pioneering doctors made were a
helpful guide.

Supportive: After the procedure, Christine wrote to her parents stating: 'Nature made a mistake which I have had corrected, and now I am your daughter'

'Apparently the surgery was 
successful enough for Jorgensen to feel satisfied,' Teit Ritzau told the
BBC of Christine's operation.

'There
seemed to be no complications and no side-effects from the treatment, 
which is quite amazing when you think about how primitive things were at
the time.'

Christine touched on the results in interviews but never went into detail.

'Everyone
is both sexes in varying degrees. I am more of a woman than a man... Of
course I can never have children but this does not mean that I cannot 
have natural sexual intercourse - I am very much in the position right 
now of a woman who has a hysterectomy,' she said in 1958, the BBC 
reported.

Luckily, Christine's parents were supportive of her decision.

After the procedure, she wrote them a note.

'Nature made a mistake which I have had corrected, and now I am your daughter,' she said.

Later, she said her mother had always known her son wasn't like the other boys.

When
she returned to New York, there was little hostility towards the 
new-found bombshell. Instead she was greeted with curiosity, fascination
and respect by the media and the public.

She
became a Hollywood star with theatre and film contracts piling up and 
invitations to all the most glamorous parties being thrown at her.

Christine was even crowned Woman of the Year by the Scandinavian Society in New York.

Sexual revolution: Christine Jorgensen's sex change was the beginning of the sexual revolution

Trying to explain her sudden popularity, Jorgensen once said: 'I guess they all want to take a peek.'

She
made a comfortable living singing and performing around the country 
throughout the 1960s and 1970s but her personal life was less 
successful.

Her first serious relationship broke down soon after their engagement.

The
next went as far as the register office, only for Jorgensen to be 
refused a marriage license when she pulled out a man's birth 
certificate, the BBC reported.

'I haven't found the right fella yet,' she regularly told reporters.

Mr Ritzau believes that, overall, she had a contented life despite her apparent loneliness.

'There
had been ups and downs and I think she had a little problem with 
alcohol, but in the end she was very straightforward, and she told me 
that the best company she had was herself,' he recalls.

Jorgensen died of cancer in 1989, at the age of 62.

A
few years before she passed away, she travelled back to Denmark to 
reunite for the last time with the doctors that changed her gender and 
her life.

With good humour, she acknowledged the significance of her operation, nearly 40 years earlier.

'We didn't start the sexual revolution but I think we gave it a good kick in the pants!'
