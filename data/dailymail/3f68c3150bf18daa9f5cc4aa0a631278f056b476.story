The police investigation to find Sumon Miah's killer was closed in 2008, but was reopened after new evidence emerged in 2010

A mother who arranged for her 13-year-old daughter’s boyfriend to be battered to death after he posted topless pictures of the girl on the internet is facing jail today.

Gedu Bibi, 47, lured 21 year-old hospital worker Sumon Miah to her home after being shown the photos of the schoolgirl. 

Once there he was hit over the head with a table leg and fell into a coma from which he never recovered. 

Mr Miah died nine days later from brain damage on October 17, 2006.

Bibi got her teenage daughter to tell police she had hit the victim in self defence after he turned up with a knife. Her 12 year-old son Fhalak also backed up the story.

Detectives shut down their investigation in 2008 but fresh information emerged two years later which led to Bibi and her former lover, 48-year-old cafe owner Lilu Miah, being charged with murder.

After a trial at the Old Bailey, jurors cleared Bibi of murder but convicted her of manslaughter and perverting the course of justice. Lilu Miah was cleared of both murder and manslaughter.

Bibi, who claimed she was asleep at the time of the attack, had suggested that her husband Angur Miah was involved.

Judge Gerald Gordon said he would sentence Bibi at a later date when her counsel is available.

The court heard Sumon Miah and Shuhina Khanam started a relationship after meeting at the hospital where he worked as a porter while she visited a friend.

Just days before the attack, Lilu Miah had shown Bibi four lewd photos of her daughter he had discovered on the internet.

On October 8, 2006, he was invited into Bibi’s family home in Walthamstow on October 8, 2006.

After being knocked out with the table leg, the weapon was immediately wiped clean and then thrust into the hands of Shuhina to ensure it held her fingerprints.

No blood or hairs were found on the weapon, and only her prints were found on the knife she claimed Miah had threatened her with.

Following Sumon’s death, a friend handed his camera phone to the police - with the same pictures still saved in its memory.

‘It seems likely that these photographs were the trigger for the show-down that took place that day,’ said Mr Aylett.

Lilu Miah admitted his guilt to close friend Monor Uddin, but it was not until Miah was behind bars that he gave an account to police.

‘He said he had done this murder by himself,’ he told jurors.

'He did it. As soon as the boy came in the door they push him in the sofa. Lilu was sitting in the kitchen with a stock. Lilu came out and banged his head just once. The boy collapsed. The stick was given to Shahina.’

During the trial, it emerged Lilu Miah’s teenage daughter had told police her father had ‘got away with murder’ - but officers ignored the information because the file had been closed.

Bibi concocted a story that allowed her and the killer or killers to cheat justice for years, said prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC.

'If that was intended to hoodwink the police into an entirely false position, it worked,’ he said. 'Years went by without any charges being brought. But, in time, the case came to be reviewed.’

When Bibi was finally arrested, she claimed she was asleep when the killing took place, while Lilu Miah claimed he had been working at his cafe.

She was overheard by a police officer fluent in her Bengali dialect muttering: ‘One bastard died, and we have to go through this.’

While being photographed in the police station, she added: ‘It’s good the b*****d died.’

Even more damning evidence came when a recording from a 999 call made seconds after the attack was re-examined.

Talking to a police operator, Fhalak claimed Sumon Miah was outside the house trying to get in. But, listening carefully, an expert in phonetics heard a man groaning in pain in the background - revealing he had already been hit.

In the same tape, Bibi is heard ordering Lilu Miah to flee: ‘Go now, get out of this house - through the garden.’

Bibi, of Forest Gate, east London, and Lilu Miah, of no fixed address, both denied murder.
