One trio of amphibians were more than happy to pose for the camera - with one grinning widely for its close up. 

But a fellow frog didn't look too happy when a butterfly disturbed his peaceful moment on a tree branch.

The three Reinwardt's Flying Frogs, commonly known as the black webbed tree frog or the green flying frog, were spotted playing in a tree by photographer Hendy Mp.

The 25-year-old, who saw the frogs near his home in Sambas, Kalimantan Barat, in Indonesia, said they reminded him of three brothers playing together.

Say cheese: The trio, pictured in Kalimantan Barat, in Indonesia, were happy to pose for the camera, with one offering up a big grin

He said: 'They were playing and kept moving around every couple of minutes - climbing on each other and changing positions.

'They reminded me of three playful brothers and the one frog that looks like he is smiling I thought was very cute.'

He added: 'I stayed there for about two hours taking pictures.

'They moved very quickly and elegantly - it reminded me of a dancer, they had the same sort of style in their movements.'

The Reinwardt's Flying Frog, native to Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, is classed as a near threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). 

Branching out: These frogs clearly have personality as they posed like pros. 'They reminded me of three playful brothers and the one frog that looks like he is smiling I thought was very cute,' said the photographer

Photographer's dream: Mr Mp said the frogs 'kept moving around every couple of minutes, climbing on each other and changing positions'

Leap frog, anyone? The three moved quickly and elegantly and reminded the photographer of dancer, who said he stayed for two hours

Hang on: The frogs, native to Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, change their position and expressions yet again

Meanwhile, in Palangkaraya, Indonesia, photographer Muhammad Berkati spotted a butterfly sat atop a green tree frog's head whilst walking through a meadow.

The 30-year-old, of Kelua, South Kalimantan, said: 'I was ecstatic that I got to witness this phenomenon, as it is very rare and not something you'd see every day.

'I woke up early on this particular day to go on a morning walk through a meadow when I spotted the special moment.'

He added: 'The frog didn't seem to react at all, it just kept quiet and let the butterfly move around and get into a comfortable position on its head, and then they just sat there together.'

Mr Berkati watched as the butterfly perched on the head of the frog for around three minutes, before flying away.

Line-up: This time, the frogs form an orderly queue on the branch. They are classed as a near threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature

Go away: The frogs turn their back on the 25-year-old photographer, who spotted them near his home in Sambas, Kalimantan Barat

Green and yellow: They can be either light green or dark green in colour and they have black spots around their backs and heads

The blue pansy butterfly was lucky to leave in one piece as the diet of a green tree frog, otherwise known as a dumpy frog, consists mainly of insects and spiders.

This breed of frog has also been known to eat smaller frogs and even small mammals.

A green tree frog can grow up to 10cm in length, and is native to northern and eastern regions of Australia and to southern New Guinea

Mr Berkati added: 'When people see these photographs they usually laugh, I've had a few comments from people saying the frog looks like it's wearing a little bow.

'I was originally only out looking to photograph frogs, but to my surprise the little butterfly hopped on this unsuspecting frog.

'I let the butterfly move freely, and the frog did not seem bothered by the presence of butterfly at all.'
