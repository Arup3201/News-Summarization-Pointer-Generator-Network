An American employee of the U.S. Embassy in Malta has been sent home after getting into a nasty dispute with a Maltese driver that was videotaped and posted on YouTube.

On Wednesday, the Embassy identified the man as a former employee. They did not name the employee but said that he 'did not comport with the standards of behavior that we expect from all embassy personnel.'

It didn’t say if he had been fired, just that he had 'departed.'

Embarrassment: A former employee at the U.S. Embassy in Malta has 'departed' the country after a video surfaced of him accosting a local driver

The incident occurred Saturday. The American challenged the Maltese driver after their two cars came nose to nose on a narrow street in the town of St. Julian’s.

With neither conceding passage, the American got out of his car and launched into a tirade of expletive-laden abuse.

He walked up to the man's car and challenged him to a fight saying: 'Hey tough guy, you wanna f*** with somebody? You wanna f*** with me? Pull over.'

Aggression: The three minute video posted on YouTube shows the embassy worker continually challenging the man to a fight, and even trying to get into the other driver's car

Road rage: Eventually the American driver backs up and the Maltese driver passes through but not before the American slaps the other's sideview mirror

He continued the verbal abuse while pulling at the car's handles, reaching into the car through an open window and slapping the sideview mirror.

His tirade took a racist turn when he started bringing the driver's heritage into his tantrum.

'Motherf*****, I will kick your Maltese f****** ass,' he said.

Eventually, the American backed out.

Reaction: The U.S. Embassy in Malta immediately apologized for the incident before they even announced that the driver was an employee

Before the man was even identified as a U.S. 
Embassy worker, the embassy released a statement on Facebook condemning 
the American driver's actions. 

'The U.S. Embassy deplores the conduct shown in the video, We regret such inexcusable behavior, whether on the part of an American citizen, or those of any other nationality. We strongly believe that everyone should be treated with respect and courtesy on the roads in the streets of our towns and villages. We're all in this together.'
