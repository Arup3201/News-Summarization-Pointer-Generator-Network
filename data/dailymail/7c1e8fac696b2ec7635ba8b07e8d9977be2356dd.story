Clutching assault rifles and with ammunition slung over their shoulders, a band of Al Qaeda sympathisers deliver the chilling rhetoric of war.

In Fallujah, an Iraqi city which came to symbolise the horror of the war to topple Saddam Hussein, their domination will for many now symbolise its futility.

Faces masked by balaclavas or headdresses, members of the Fallujah Military Council pledge to punish tribesmen who try to drive them from the besieged city.

Menacing: Masked insurgents brandish rifles and bullets as their commander warns the Iraqi government

Speaking into a microphone in front of
 an Iraqi flag, the commander of the armed brigade rants that militants 
will crush anyone loyal to government forces.

At least 200 troops, rebel fighters and civilians have died in clashes in the area in recent days.

Its descent into chaos will leave many asking what was achieved by eight years of war.

Britain
 lost 179 troops in the push to topple Saddam, after which Fallujah 
became the scene of bloody battles between insurgents and US-led forces.

Despite the sacrifice, the city is now under Al Qaeda control.

The
 Iraqi army is surrounding Fallujah, and has deployed tanks and 
artillery ahead of an all-out military assault to retake the city.

But
 prime minister Nouri al-Maliki is delaying an all-out offensive in the 
hope locals can regain control from the insurgents without major 
bloodshed.

The violence – 
the most direct challenge to al-Maliki since the US withdrew in 2011 – 
has been inflamed by the civil war in neighbouring Syria.

Rebels have been strengthened by recruits, guns, missiles and ammunition smuggled over the border.

The US is speeding up the delivery of military equipment to help the Iraqi government.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said additional Hellfire missiles would be shipped to Baghdad as early as the spring.

Military
 experts fear the problems in Iraq do not bode well for the British 
withdrawal from Afghanistan, where 447 troops have been killed since the
 mission began in 2001.

Ex-SAS
 commander Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams said: ‘I will be very 
surprised if the future governor of Helmand is not very closely 
connected to those who we call the Taliban.’
