Syria's first lady is seen in public for the first time in months as air strikes by her husband's forces kill at least 39 people, more than half of them civilians.

Pictures of Asma al Assad smiling with the young winners of the a science competition in Damascus have been uploaded on to the Syrian Presidency's Instagram and Facebook accounts today.

President Bashar al-Assad's British-born wife has not been photographed in public for many months, and her appearance comes as government air strikes hit two main battlegrounds in the north of the country, according to the The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The British-based organisation has documented the deaths of at least 27 people in the attacks targeting the outskirts of Tal Hamis.

Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said nine of those killed had been identified by his group as civilians.

'More of the dead may be civilians too, but we have not yet been able to confirm that,' Mr Rahman said.

He added that Tal Hamis, situated in Hasakeh province which borders Iraq and which is home to a sizeable Kurdish population, is under the control of the Islamic State jihadist group.

'There are daily air regime and (US-led) coalition air strikes against IS positions in Hasakeh,' said Abdel Rahman.

Today's bombing was especially deadly because it struck a cattle market.

Earlier today, the observatory reported a string of air strikes against the town of Saraqeb and the village of Sheikh Mustafa in the northwestern province of Idlib.

Eleven civilians were killed in Saraqeb, and another man died in Sheikh Mustafa, according to the group. Both towns are under jihadist control, though all of Tuesday's casualties there were civilians.

This is not the first time the first lady has come under fire for social media images. In 2013 she was criticised for a shameless PR stunt which showed her helping some of the country's refugees. 

And she's not alone in making the most of picture opportunities - President Assad was captured on camera during a New Year's Eve visit to a combat zone in the east Damascus district of Jobar.

The conflict began when forces loyal to President Assad launched a brutal crackdown on peaceful pro-reform protests in March 2011 that triggered a complex, multi-sided civil war.

It has cost the lives of more than 200,000 people and forced half the country's population to flee their homes.
