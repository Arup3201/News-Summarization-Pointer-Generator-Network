Alan Shearer has warned Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal that he needs to sign three world-class players just to make the top four.

The Red Devils are desperate to make up for their Champions League failure this season and the Dutchman vowed to spend after watching his injury-hit side lose 2-1 at home to Swansea on the opening day of the Premier League season.

And Match of the Day presenter Shearer said Saturday's disappointing defeat at Old Trafford could be a 'blessing in disguise'.

He said: 'As poor a performance as it was, and a poor result, it could be a blessing in disguise because it could say to the money men at Manchester United they need at least three world class players.

'They need big money to be spent on top, top players to get into the top four let alone to challenge for the championship.'

United's pursuit of players during the summer has been hampered by their failure to qualify for the Champions League.

Shearer added: 'It's similar to last season when they left it late to sign players and they were found wanting.' 

Dutchman Ruud Gullit expressed surprise that Van Gaal had ditched the attacking philosophy that had served his fellow-countryman so well during his spells in charge at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich,

He said: 'My biggest surprise was when he played the 3-5-2 system with Holland it was a necessity because we had bad defenders.

'But at Manchester United you have to play attacking football and he adapted the game he did with the national team.

'At Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich he played 4-4-3, and always attacking football and now all of a sudden he's going to play this way.'
