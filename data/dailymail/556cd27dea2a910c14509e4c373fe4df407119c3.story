It's long been thought that humans evolved by looking out for themselves and making selfish decisions, yet it appears this evolution theory may have taken a turn as scientists discover being generous and working as a team is now the only way we can survive.

Being selfish in the short term may garner the best immediate results, but selfish people will end up being less successful over time compared to their more generous counterparts, claims a new study.

By applying the Prisoner's 
Dilemma theory - usually played with two people in which they are 
asked to incriminate each other to escape punishment - to populations, researchers from Pennsylvania found that cooperation evolved because being generous breeds success for all.

This is because when the dilemma is played in pairs, being selfish guarantees the person making the decision the best possible outcome, yet, over time, being selfish to someone will eventually cause that person to be selfish in return meaning the initial successes are undone and no one wins.

Researchers from Pennsylvania claim that teamwork, seen in insects such as the leafcutter ants pictured, evolved because being generous makes groups as a whole more successful. This only works when generous people also forgive selfish people and don't seek revenge

Researchers used the Prisoner's Dilemma 
game to study cooperation where two people who have committed a crime 
are arrested and each are offered a deal by police.

The premise is, grass on your friend
 and go free while the friend spends six months in jail.

If
 both prisoners grass, they both get three months in jail. If they both 
stay silent, they both get one month in jail for a lesser offence.

If
 the two prisoners get a chance to talk to each other, they can 
establish trust and are usually more likely to cooperate because then 
both of them only spend one month in jail.

But if they're not allowed to
 talk, the best strategy is to grass because it guarantees you don't get
 the longer jail term.

The game allows scientists to study a 
basic question faced by individuals competing for limited resources - do
 I act selfishly or do I cooperate?

They add that when everyone cooperates and is generous, that generosity spreads and everyone succeeds eventually, even if they have to make sacrifices.Â 

The study continues that this also needs to be coupled with forgiveness, meaning if someone has been wronged they should not seek revenge but instead show generosity in return.

Researchers Alexander J. 
Stewart and Joshua B. Plotkin from Pennsylvania's Department
 of Biology in the School of Arts and Sciences, examined the outcome of 
the Prisoner's Dilemma when played repeatedly by a large, evolving group 
of players.

While other
 researchers have previously suggested that being cooperative can be 
successful, Stewart and Plotkin offer 'mathematical 
proof' that the only strategies that succeed in the long term are 
generous ones.

'Ever 
since Darwin,' said Plotkin, 'Biologists have been puzzled about why 
there is so much apparent cooperation, and even flat-out generosity and 
altruism, in nature.

'The
 literature on game theory has worked to explain why generosity arises. 
Our paper provides such an explanation for why we see so much generosity
 in front of us.'

According to
 Plotkin, in 2012, Press and Dyson 'shocked the world of game theory' by
 identifying a group of strategies for playing this version of the game.

They called this 
class of approaches 'zero determinant' strategies because the score of 
one player is directly related to the other. They also focused on a range of zero determinant approaches they called extortion strategies.

If
 a player taking part in a so-called extortion strategy - in which they extort the situation for their personal game - against an 
unwitting opponent, that player could force the opponent into getting a
 lower score, or losing out.

Being selfish in the short term guarantees the best possible immediate outcome, yet, over time, being selfish to someone will eventually cause that person to be selfish in return meaning the initial successes are undone and no-one wins. This then affects the overall success of a group

Instead
 of a head-to-head competition, Stewart and Plotkin applied this to a population of people 
playing against one another, to mimic what might happen in a human or 
animal society in nature.

In their version of the game, the most successful players would get to have more offspring, therefore 
passing on their strategies to the next generation of players.

During
 research, Stewart and Plotkin found that the extortion strategies 
wouldn't do well if played within a large, evolving population because 
an extortion strategy doesn't succeed when played against itself.

Study used the Prisoner's Dilemma in which a person is offered the chance to walk away free if they incriminate someone else

'The
 fact that there are extortion strategies immediately suggests that, at 
the other end of the scale, there might also be generous strategies,' 
said Stewart.

'You 
might think being generous would be a stupid thing to do, and it is if 
there are only two players in the game, but, if there are many players 
and they all play generously, they all benefit from each other's 
generosity.

'In generous 
strategies 
players tend to cooperate with their opponents more, but, if they don't,
 they suffer more than their opponents do over the long term.

The
 continued that 'forgiveness' is also a feature of these strategies - a 
player who encounters a defector may punish the defector a bit but after
 a time may cooperate with the defector again.

After
 simulating how some generous strategies would play out in an evolving 
population, he and Plotkin crafted a mathematical formula proving that, 
not only can generous strategies work best in the population version of 
the Prisoner's Dilemma, these are the only approaches that resist 
defectors over the long term.

'Our
 paper shows that no selfish strategies will succeed in evolution,' 
Plotkin said. 'The only strategies that are evolutionarily robust are 
generous ones.'

The 
discovery, while abstract, helps explain the presence of generosity in 
nature, an inclination that can sometimes seem to go against the 
Darwinian notion of survival of the fittest.

'When
 people act generously they feel it is almost instinctual, and indeed a 
large literature in evolutionary psychology shows that people derive 
happiness from being generous,' Plotkin said.

'It's
 not just in humans. Of course social insects behave this way, but even 
bacteria and viruses share gene products and behave in ways that can't 
be described as anything but generous.'

'We
 find that in evolution, a population that encourages cooperation does 
well,' Stewart said. 'To maintain cooperation over the long term, it is 
best to be generous.'

The findings were reported in the PNAS journal.

Dilemma involves choosing to save yourself or help another person

When played with two people, being selfish gives the best result

Yet being selfish when in a large group eventually breeds selfish behaviour and the group as a whole loses out on initial benefits

Study concludes that this 'proves' why generosity evolved in nature
