Mark Zuckerberg has responded to the recent tragedy that occurred in Paris by recounting a 2010 incident he had with a Pakistani extremist.

Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook, 'A few years ago, an extremist in Pakistan fought to have me sentenced to death because Facebook refused to ban content about Mohammed that offended him.'

This as a result of the site's promotion of an Everybody Draw Mohammed Day which took place on May 20 of that year.

Speaking out: Mark Zuckerberg (above) has responded to the recent tragedy that occurred in Paris by recounting a 2010 incident he had with a Pakistani extremist

Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook , 'A few years ago, an extremist in Pakistan fought to have me sentenced to death because Facebook refused to ban content about Mohammed that offended him'

And while he did not end up being charged with any crime or sentenced to death, the Pakistani government did block Facebook in their country.

'We stood up for this because different voices -- even if they're sometimes offensive -- can make the world a better and more interesting place,' explained Zuckerberg. 

'Facebook has always been a place where people across the world share their views and ideas. We follow the laws in each country, but we never let one country or group of people dictate what people can share across the world.' 

The idea for the day came after Comedy Central decided to censor a not-so-flattering rendering of the prophet on their show South Park.

This act was deemed illegal under Pakistani law, where it is a crime to defile the 'sacred name of Mohammed.'

This under Islamic Sharia law. 

Zuckerberg ends his statement by honoring those who lost their lives in Paris, writing; 'My thoughts are with the victims, their families, the people of France and the people all over the world who choose to share their views and ideas, even when that takes courage. ‪#‎JeSuisCharlie‬.' 

Many Muslims however are taking issue with Zuckerberg's statement, with one, Aftab Ahmed, writing; 'What about all those people in Palestine , Iraq , Afghanistan , Syria died Never seen you condemned about those barbaric acts talk about standing for right Mr Zuckerberg.'

He then added; Yet you ban countless pages for posting "offensive" things so how can you say that you refuse to let one group silence everyone when Facebook bans pages for posting humor?'

'Freedom of speech and hate speech is not the same.. Go educate yourself please...'

That comment already has close to 10,000 likes.
