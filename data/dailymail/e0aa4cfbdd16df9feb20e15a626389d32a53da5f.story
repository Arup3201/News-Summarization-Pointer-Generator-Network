Neighbour from hell: Bill Seed admitted harassing William and Carolyn Maxwell

An 80-year-old has pleaded guilty to waging a five-year harassment campaign against his neighbours which they described as 'like a form of water torture'.

William Seed would beep his car horn at all hours of day and night, make loud animal noises, scrape shovels along the ground in order to make a racket, and slowly drive past Carolyn and William Maxwell while staring at them in a bid to intimidate them.

He repeatedly accused Mrs Maxwell of having an affair with an ex-policeman, and swore at the couple in front of children, a court heard.

Mr and Mrs Maxwell told Blackburn Magistrates' Court that Seed's behaviour was 'like a form of water torture' and 'had a ruinous effect on what should have been the best years of our lives with our young family'.

Seed, who was previously convicted of killing cats, started his campaign against the Maxwells when they erected a fence on their property in Longridge, Lancashire, soon after they moved to the town.

When the couple complained about his behaviour, police asked them to keep a diary of his misdeeds.

Officers also examined video footage captured on mobile phones and CCTV, and saw Seed banging on his neighbours' fence with a spade in an effort to wake their dog.

Seed, a retired lorry driver who has lived on the same street with his wife for 44 years, initially refused to co-operate with police, but pleaded guilty at the last minute.

However, he insists that he was provoked by the neighbours, and denies making up the affair rumours and swearing at the Maxwells.

In an impact statement read to the court, the couple said: 'It has been absolutely soul-destroying and puts a chill in our blood.

'It means that we never get a lie-in at weekends as we wake up when Mr Seed does, and it makes the children think that this is what people do.

'This is not like living near to a public house or a train line, it’s an entirely voluntary act by this man who didn’t get his own way over one thing and has decided to make his neighbours' lives hell.

'We deeply regret ever having moved next to Mr Seed. It has had a ruinous effect on what should have been the best years of our lives with our young family.

'We thought about using the same mechanisms against him, but what example would that set for the children?'

Defence lawyer Scott Parker said that his client was 'apologetic about what's been going on', adding: 'Mr Seed is 80 years of age, and by his own admission is not as educated as his neighbours.

'He has been retired a long time and has a lot of time on his hands, and that's the problem in this situation.

'He maintains that he is always careful of his language in front of young people, but he was a working man and swearing is part of his common parlance.'

The Probation Service drew up a report on Seed, which stated that he 'accepts that it has reached a point where a line has to be drawn'.

He was sentenced to a 12-month supervision order and has to pay a total of £250 compensation to his victims.

Speaking after the case, Mr and Mrs Maxwell said: 'All we ever wanted was to have quiet lives and now we want to be left alone.'

Seed previously avoided jail in 2003 after he admitted killing up to 10 cats by smashing them over the head with a hammer and then drowning them in a dustbin filled with water.
