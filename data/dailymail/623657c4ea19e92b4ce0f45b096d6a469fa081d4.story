A mosque has been under attack for the second time in less than a week after a pig's head was discovered at the site.

Worshippers found the head in the mosque's courtyard in Wallsend in Newcastle's western suburbs of New South Wales shortly before midday on Wednesday.

The incident has been caught on CCTV and police are currently investigating the attack.

'It's a sad incident,' Newcastle Muslim Association spokeswoman Diana Rah told AAP.

'It's not so much the action itself, but it's the intention and hate behind it.

'We've got a lot of support from the wider community, so it's a shame that there are elements in the community who commit these sorts of crimes.' 

The incident follows just days after a Muslim man was punched in the face and racially taunted outside the mosque as he left a prayer last Wednesday.

But Ms Rah said she wasn't sure if the two attacks were linked.

'In the last couple of months there has been a heightened level of verbal abuse, especially with women in the community being targeted because they're easily identifiable wearing hijabs,' she said.

'But that had started to die down and we thought we'd hopefully seen the end of it.

'But the incident last week, and this incident again this week, has probably put a bit of fear into our community.'

Newcastle Superintendent John Gralton would not comment on the motivation behind the attack and has appealed for information from the public.

'This type of incident does not belong anywhere in Newcastle or in NSW,' he said.

'The command will use all resources to bring those responsible to justice.'

The NSW member for Wallsend Sonia Hornery condemned the 'sickening racist attack' on the mosque

The NSW member for Wallsend Sonia Hornery condemned the 'sickening racist attack' on the mosque.

'There is no place for racist attacks in the Hunter like this one. There have been very few incidents at the Mosque since it opened its doors more than 20 years ago,' she posted on Facebook.

'But this is the second attack on the Mosque within seven days and I will be seeking more information from local police to see what can be done to ensure that this stops.

'I absolutely deplore this attack and hope the perpetrators are brought to justice quickly.'
