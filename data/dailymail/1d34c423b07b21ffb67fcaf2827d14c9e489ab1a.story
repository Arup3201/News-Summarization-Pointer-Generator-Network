Ted Bishop has been removed from his post as the president of PGA of America for the 'insensitive gender-based statements' he made about English golfer Ian Poulter on social media, the golf governing body announced after a vote on Friday.

Bishop called Poulter a 'Lil Girl' in a series of outbursts on his personal Twitter on Thursday in a post that have since been deleted.

He also elaborated on the comments on Facebook, describing Poulter as like a 'little girl screaming during recess'. 

Bishop, the 38th PGA president, was reacting to the English Ryder Cup star making critical remarks in his recently-released autobiography about Tom Watson and Nick Faldo's methods as captains in the Europe vs United States format.

Ousted: Ted Bishop aimed an assault at Ian Poulter, who had criticized Nick Faldo's captaincy at the 2008 Ryder Cup. The PGA of America board voted to remove him from his position on Friday as a result

Offensive: This is the Tweet - which was deleted - from Ted Bishop that called Poulter a 'Lil Girl'. Those two words got the PGA chief sacked 

'Lil Girl': Poulter said the comments made by Bishop were 'disappointing for the leader of the PGA of America'

Statement: Bishop apologized for his comments after he was removed from his position as PGA chief 

Poulter hit back at the 38th PGA president, labelling the comments 'pretty shocking and disappointing', and on Friday the PGA of America announced it had voted to relieve Bishop of his duties.

A statement read: 'The PGA of America board of directors voted today to remove Ted Bishop from office for insensitive gender-based statements posted yesterday on social media. The board deemed the remarks to be inconsistent with the policies of the PGA.'

PGA chief executive Pete Bevacqu said: 'The PGA of America understands the enormous responsibility it has to lead this great game and to enrich lives in our society through golf.

'We must demand of ourselves that we make golf both welcoming and inclusive to all who want to experience it, and everyone at the PGA of America must lead by example.'

Vice-president Derek Sprague has been appointed interim president until November 22, when there will be an election.

Sprague said: 'We apologize to any individual or group that felt diminished, in any way, by this unacceptable incident.'

The PGA of America acted following Bishop's comments about Poulter.

Firing line: Poulter said English golfer Sir Nick Faldo (pictured) has lost a lot of respect from players because of his comments about Sergio Garcia. Bishop was responding to those claims

The Englishman also hit out at US golfer Tom Watson (pictured) for dropping Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley at the Ryder Cup 

Bishop first wrote on Twitter: '@IanJamesPoulter -Faldo's record stands by itself. Six majors and all-time RC points. Yours vs. His? Lil Girl. @NickFaldo006 @pgaofamerica.'

Bishop then expanded his point on Facebook, saying: 'Used to be athletes who had lesser records or accomplishments in a sport never criticized the icons.

'Tom Watson (8 majors and a 10-3-1 Ryder Cup record) and Nick Faldo (6 majors and all-time Ryder Cup points leader) get bashed by Ian James Poulter. Really? Sounds like a little school girl squealing during recess. C'MON MAN!'

Poulter, himself yet to triumph in a major, was taken aback by the remark.

'Is being called a 'lil girl' meant to be derogatory or a put down?' Poulter told Golf Channel.

'That's pretty shocking and disappointing, especially coming from the leader of the PGA of America. No further comment.'

The 38-year-old questioned Watson in his book, saying his captaincy at the recent Ryder Cup - which Europe won 16 1/2-11 1/2 - was 'utterly bizarre' and handed the initiative to Europe.

Faldo, Europe's all-time leading points scorer, also came in for criticism from Poulter for saying Sergio Garcia was 'useless' in 2008 in television commentary.

'Faldo has lost a lot of respect from players because of what he said,' Poulter wrote in 'No Limits'. '[2008] is the only Ryder Cup we've lost in the last 15 years. And he was captain.

Winners: Poulter and Garcia (right) celebrate with the trophy after Europe's Ryder Cup victory earlier this year

'So who's useless? I think Faldo might need to have a little look in the mirror.'

Bishop has since apologized for his comments. 

However he tried to fight his impeachment, refusing to step down as president until he could personally speak with the PGA board.

After the meeting, the board voted and removed him 

'The board heard me out and then voted to impeach me,' Bishop said in a statement. 

That is the due process and I respect that, as painful as it might be.'

In removing Bishop as president, he will be removed from the association's list of past presidents.

Bishop went on: 'I want to apologize to Ian Poulter and anyone else that I might have offended with my remarks on social media that appeared on October 23, 2014.

'Particularly, I have great remorse that my comments contained the words 'little girl' because I have always been a great advocate for girls and women in golf.

'My two children, both girls, have made their careers in golf. I have a 4-year old granddaughter who I hope will someday play the game. In my 37-year career in golf, I have worked with many women to grow the sport and I have been a champion for inclusion and equal rights for women in golf.

'However, this is a classic example of poor use of social media on my part and if I had the chance to hit the delete button on the things that I sent out yesterday, I would without hesitation.

'The PGA of America asked me to avoid any interaction with the media in the past 24 hours and that is why I did not issue a formal and public apology, which I have wanted to do since early this morning.'
