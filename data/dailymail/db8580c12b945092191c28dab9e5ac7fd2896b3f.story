These deer would look more at home on the set of Strictly Come Dancing than in the forest. 

Standing tall on their hind legs, the animals appear to be pulling off well-timed dance moves.

But the rhythmic deer were actually playfully rutting - and even stopped for a quick game of hide and seek in the bushes.

Standing tall on their hind legs, the two animals appear to be pulling off well-timed dance moves. In fact, they are playfully rutting

Rutting, which usually occurs in October and early November, is when stags lock antlers to compete for mating rights with the females

Keen photographer Bartek Olszewski, 32, snapped the spectacular scene in Richmond Park, London.

Bartek, a cleaning supervisor from Southwest London, said: 'I was so lucky - I saw these two rutting stags rising up high into the air.

'It only lasted a few seconds so I sank to my knees and snapped away as fast as I could.'

The photographer said that wildlife can be unpredictable and can surprise you at any time - so you have to be ready

But this pair seemed to be moving in perfectly in time with each other as though ballroom music was playing.

'People then began jesting - saying they look like dancing deer,' Bartek added.

'Wildlife is unpredictable so can surprise you at any time, I have to always be ready.

'What fascinates me most is to find deer and enjoying the natural behavior without noticing my presence.'
