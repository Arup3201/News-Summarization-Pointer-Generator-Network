Peter Eveson, 39, was jailed for two years and four months after he admitted to breaking into his father's neighbour's home

A serial crook has been jailed for breaking into a house after he was accidentally shopped to police by his own father - who called the police after becoming concerned about his neighbour's burglar alarm.

Peter Eveson, 39, smashed into the property on his father's street and stole jewellery and a phone on November 27 last year.

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard after committing the crime he then casually went to his father's house nearby for a cup of tea and a chat.

But while he was there, Mr Eveson Snr became concerned as the alarm on the house his son had just raided was sounding in the street.

He contacted police when he saw from his Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, home that his neighbour's patio doors had been smashed in

Eveson then became agitated prompting his dad to confront him about about the burglary and ask if he was responsible.

But the thief pleaded his innocence and denied any involvement telling his father he 'would never commit such a crime on his doorstep.'

He later came clean and admitted the break-in and on Thursday was jailed for two years and four months.

During sentencing, Judge David Fletcher said: 'You will be 40 next year, by the time of your release probably 41.

'That may be an opportunity for you to take stock of your life. At the time it is in complete chaos.'

The court heard Eveson has 39 convictions for 79 offences, including 20 previous convictions for burglary, and had committed his latest crime just days before this raid.

Neil Ahuja, prosecuting, said the victim left his house secure on the afternoon of November 27 when Eveson broke in and went to his father's home at 5pm.

He said: 'His father went to check as the alarm was sounding and discovered the rear patio doors had been smashed. He reported the matter to the police.

'The defendant became agitated. His father challenged him and asked if he was responsible for the burglary.

'He denied it and said he would not do it at his doorstep.'

Hamish Noble, defending, said drink had been the 'chief mischief' and Eveson committed the offences to fund his alcohol addiction.

Eveson, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to two charges of burglary and asked for four other house burglaries to be taken into consideration.

He also admitted two charges of criminal damage.
