Online shopping has revolutionised how we buy groceries, but it still requires a fair amount of time sat ordering items from a laptop or mobile device.

To make spending our money easier, Amazon has launched a magic wand-style device called Dash that acts as a handheld, personal shopping assistant.

It scans barcodes of items that are running low in cupboards or fridges, for example, or customers use voice commands to add goods to an online shopping list.

Dash (pictured) is a free, black and white wand-like device available to customers of Amazon Fresh in select U.S states. It scans barcodes of items that are running low in cupboards or fridges, or users can use voice commands to order goods. Each scanned or spoken item is then added to their basket on Amazon Fresh

Dash (pictured right) connects to a smartphone or laptop via Bluetooth. 

It has a built-in barcode scanner and microphone.

Users scan barcodes of items that are 
running low in cupboards or fridges, or use voice commands to 
add goods to an online shopping list.

Each scanned or spoken item is automatically added to the customer’s basket on Amazon Fresh.

They then checkout using the Amazon Fresh site on a laptop or via an app.

 Dash is a free device but only works with Amazon Fresh, which is only currently 
available in Southern California, San Francisco and certain 
neighbourhoods in Seattle.

Amazon Dash is a free device but only works with Amazon Fresh, which is only available in Southern California, San Francisco and certain neighbourhoods in Seattle.

Although Amazon hasn’t revealed when its Fresh service will be rolled out globally, Amazon's UK vice president Doug Gurr said in February: ‘We don’t publish forward strategy plans but history would suggest that once we roll out something across North America, typically that leads to international expansion.’

In addition to groceries, Amazon Fresh sells a total of 500,000 items including electronics, household tools, software, games and entertainment.

The Amazon Dash tool complements Amazon's  Flow app that launched in February.

Flow uses augmented reality to help people discover information about items around them.

For example, when a user holds the phone’s camera over an object - such as a book, game or box of cereal - the app will identify what it is, and reveal more information about the product.

This includes the author, release date, calories of food items, and more. It also lets users scan and dial phone numbers of launch websites from magazines, adverts or posters. 

Other items will start playing audio clips or video clips when the app scans it.

Amazon Flow works in a similar way to Google’s Googles.

Once an item has been identified, it can be shared on social networks or that item can be bought directly from Amazon.
