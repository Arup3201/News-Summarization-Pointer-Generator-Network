Samsung has already taken its first steps into the world of wearables - with its Gear range of smartwatches - and rumours suggest it’s gearing up to launch a Google Glass rival in the autumn.

These reports were bolstered this week by a Samsung patent that not only hints at an upcoming wearable device – it details a system in which wearers could turn their hands into the keyboard.

In the proposed system, people wearing a camera - on a Google Glass-style device dubbed Galaxy Glass - would be able to look down at their hands, which would be mapped using a virtual keyboard, and use their thumbs to select the keys.

The patent was filed in 2013 to the World Intellectual Property Organisation. In the proposed system, people wearing a camera - on a Google Glass-style device, dubbed Galaxy Glass - would be able to look down at their hands, which would be mapped using a virtual keyboard, and use their thumbs to select keys, pictured

In
 the proposed system, people wearing the camera - on a Google 
Glass-style device dubbed Galaxy Glass - would be able to look down at their hands, which 
would be mapped using a virtual keyboard.

For
 example, numbers could be assigned to a forefinger, while symbols could 
be assigned to a middle finger.

Alternatively, letters could be 
plotted at various points across the fingers and palm from top to 
bottom.

Users would then use their thumb to 'press' the various keys on both hands.

The
 camera would capture the movement of the thumb, or identify the force 
pressed onto each finger to establish which key had been pressed and 
type the message accordingly. 

The patent was filed in 2013 to the World Intellectual Property Organisation as well as South Korea’s Korean Intellectual Property Office, and was found by Galaxy Club Netherlands.

It relates to 'an input apparatus and method for providing a camera-assisted input operation for use in a portable device.'

‘Recently there is much interest in the wearable computers such as glasses-type terminal and wristwatch terminals,’ continued the patent.

‘Such wearable computers are even more limited in space for mounting an input means such as button type keypad and touchscreen.'

The system involves a camera for capturing an image, a storage unit that stores the ‘key to hand mapping table’, a display and a control unit.

Numbers could 
be assigned to a forefinger, for example, while symbols could be assigned to the middle
 finger. Alternatively, letters could be plotted at various points 
across the fingers and palm from top to bottom.

For example, numbers could be assigned to a forefinger, middle finger and closed fist, pictured, while symbols could be assigned to a little finger. Alternatively, letters could be plotted at various points across the fingers and palm, from left to right and from top to bottom

The proposed system involves a camera for capturing an image, a storage unit that stores the ‘key to hand mapping table’, pictured left, a display and a control unit. This table would then be mapped onto the wearer's actual hand. Wearers would then use the table as a guide on the glasses' display to type their message

Users would then use their thumb to ‘press’ the various keys on both hands.

The camera would capture the movement of the thumb, or identify the force pressed onto each finger, to establish which key had been pressed and type the message accordingly.

Reports in The Korea Times in January were the first to suggest Samsung is working on a Google Glass rival.

The article explained the Galaxy Glass would sync to a smartphone and let the wearer make and receive calls, and listen to music. This makes it simialr to how the Galaxy Gear, Gear 2 and Gear Neo smartwatches work.
