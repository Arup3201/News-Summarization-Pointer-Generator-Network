A plane intercepted on its way from Moscow to Damascus was carrying military equipment and ammunition to Syria, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said today.

Erdogan says the cargo seized by Turkish authorities late Wednesday was destined for the Syrian military.

He told reporters in Ankara that Turkey was still examining the equipment and that 'the necessary will follow.'

Syria has denied that the Syrian Air Airbus A320 was carrying an illicit cargo.

'Air piracy': Passengers and investigators gather at the entrance of the jet, which was forced to land at Ankara airport late on Wednesday

Moscow has accused Ankara of endangering Russian lives after Turkey
scrambled fighter planes to force the Syrian passenger jet to land and 
seized what it suspected was military equipment being ferried President 
Bashar al-Assad's forces.

The
interception of the Syrian Air plane came hours after Turkey's chief of
staff warned that his troops would respond with greater force if shells
from Syria continued to hit Turkish territory.

Military
jets escorted the Damascus-bound Airbus A-320, which was carrying 
around 30 passengers from Moscow, into Ankara airport late on Wednesday 
after Turkey received intelligence that it was carrying military 
supplies.

The plane and its passengers were allowed to continue after parts of the cargo were seized.

Officials gave no details of what was confiscated, saying investigations were underway, but some Turkish newspapers said the cargo included non-lethal supplies such as radio equipment.

Ghaida Abdulatif, head of Syrian Arab Airlines, said: The plane was not carrying any illegal material.

'When the plane was inspected it was clear that there were ...
civilian packages with electrical equipment which are allowed to be 
transported and had been officially registered.'

Diplomatic row: Turkey's Foreign Minister said his country was within its rights to investigate planes suspected of carrying military materials

Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet 
Davutoglu said: 'We are determined to control weapons transfers to a 
regime that carries out such brutal massacres against civilians. It is 
unacceptable that such a transfer is made using our airspace.

'Today
we received information this plane was carrying cargo of a nature that 
could not possibly be in compliance with the rules of civil aviation,' 
he added in Athens during an official visit in comments broadcast live 
on Turkish television.

Davutoglu
said Turkey was within its rights to investigate planes suspected of 
carrying military materials but declined to say what was in the cargo.

Turkey would continue to investigate Syrian civilian aircraft using its airspace, he said.

Syria's transport minister has accused Turkey on Thursday of 'air piracy', according to Lebanon's al-Manar Television.

The channel quoted minister Mahoumd Said as saying the move 'contradicts civil aviation treaties'.

Turkish authorities have also instructed Turkish passenger planes not to fly in Syrian airspace, saying it was no longer safe.

A
witness at the border saw at least one passenger plane turn around as 
it approached Syria and head back into Turkey on Wednesday.

Russia, which has stood behind Assad's government during an 18-month-old uprising that has killed some 30,000 people, has
demanded an explanation from Turkish authorities for the interception 
of the plane, Interfax cited a Russia Foreign Ministry source as saying.

'The lives and safety of the passengers were placed under threat', the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement, adding that 17 of its nationals on board were refused access to Russian diplomatic staff.

A source in a Russian arms exporting 
agency told Interfax that no Russian 'weapons nor any kind of systems or
parts for military equipment' were on board the aircraft.

'If we needed to send any kind of military-technical equipment or arms it would have been carried out properly and not through any illegal means, certainly not on a civilian aircraft,' the source said.

Rebels are outgunned by the government but can still strike at will, and President Bashar al-Assad has assumed personal command of his forces, convinced he can prevail militarily.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 70 people had been killed across Syria on Wednesday, including six rebels in the strategic town of Maarat al-Nuaman, on the north-south highway linking Aleppo to the capital Damascus.

Meanwhile, the conflict threatens to 
spill over Syria's borders and ignite a wider Middle Eastern war, 
drawing in neighbouring states and pitting Sunni Muslim states against 
Syria's rulers and their allies including Shi'ite Iran.

Russia, from where the Syrian plane took off, has blocked tougher U.N. resolutions against Damascus.

'Once
a week a Syrian Airlines airplane flies from Moscow bound for 
Damascus,' Interfax reported Vnukovo Airport spokeswoman Yelena Krylova 
as saying. 'The plane took off normally, there were no incidents.'

Interfax
cited her as saying 25 people were on board the chartered plane and it 
left 20 minutes after its scheduled afternoon departure time.

Turkey's armed forces have bolstered 
their presence along the 900km (560-mile) border and have been firing 
back over the past week in response to gunfire and shelling coming 
across from northern Syria, where Assad's forces have been battling 
rebels who control swathes of territory.

'We
responded but if it continues we will respond with greater force,' 
state television TRT quoted Turkey's Chief of Staff, General Necdet 
Ozel, as saying.

Several 
mortar bombs landed outside the Syrian border town of Azmarin and heavy 
machine gun fire could be heard on Wednesday as clashes between the 
Syrian army and rebels intensified.

Scores of civilians, many of them women with screaming children clinging to their necks, crossed a narrow river marking the border with Turkey as they fled the fighting.

The news comes after the UN reported that 335,000 Syrian refugees have 
registered with the organisation, an increase by ten times since March.

NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Tuesday the military alliance had plans in place to defend Turkey.

It is not clear whether the shells that have hit Turkish territory were aimed to strike there or were due to Syrian troops overshooting as they attacked rebel positions.

Turkey has provided sanctuary for rebel officers and fighters.
