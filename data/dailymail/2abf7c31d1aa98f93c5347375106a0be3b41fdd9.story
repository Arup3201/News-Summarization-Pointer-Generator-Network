Central Park West will soon be missing an unlikely inhabitant to its rarefied row of multi-million dollar homes as NASCAR great Jeff Gordon puts his $30 million Manhattan condo on the market.

The four-time NASCAR Cup Series champion will likely be driving away from the place even richer than when he purchased the Central Park adjacent digs in 2007 for a mere $9.67 million.

And $30 million is just the asking price since many well-heeled Manhattanites (or wannabe Manhattanites) will undoubtedly be clamouring for a spot in the highly sought-after building at 15 Central Park West.

Steal: NASCAR superstar Jeff Gordon has put his Central Park West condo on the market for a cool $30 million

The New York Times calls the building the ‘reigning superstar of Manhattan trophy residences,’ and Gordon’s apartment, with its Brazilian cherry floors, spatterings of flamed black granite, and other precocious appoints is front and center of the pack.

His unit, number 7C, is located in the building’s preferable 20-story frontispiece, known only as ‘The House,’ which allows sprawling views just at the edge of the treetops in the city’s favorite strip of woodland.

The great room in Gordon’s 3,454-square-foot residence offers the lucky buyer a personalized view of the park. Through the residence’s only glass doors (the rest are rift-cut oak), those eating in the dining area are also privy to peeks at nature.

Less desirable is ‘the Tower,’ a tower that rises 43-stories behind ‘the House’ and offers views of the Hudson River.

Breathtaking: The 3,454-square-foot stunner offers treetop views of Central Park

The best: Gordon's pad is located at the most desired address in the already beloved row of multi-million dollar apartment buildings, 15 Central Park West

Kitchen: The elegant kitchen features Italian ceramic floors and neo-Paris stone backsplash

Upon entering the lavish abode, visitors step upon bronze-inlaid flooring in the foyer and pass a powder room with a limestone vanity just past the cloak room.

A steel-topped oak built-in that Gordon calls ‘the sushi bar’ is the living room’s centrepiece and hides a refrigerator underneath.

From there, one may tiptoe across the Italian ceramic floors past the finest culinary appointments, a wine cooler, and neo-Paris stone backsplash.

Bathroom: All three bedrooms have en suite baths and the master bath features a stand-up shower with room for two

Bedrooms: The condo's bedroom wing has window's facing the building's verdant courtyard

And for those who are invited, the master suite beyond offers a roomy 743-square-feet of slumber space.

For now, though, that room is reserved—as is the entirety of the pristine and playful pad—for Gordon and wife Ingrid Vandebosch.

Whoever ends up buying the place will have the two of them to thank.

The pair purchased the apartment from the offering plan, so it came to them as ‘a big white box with high ceilings.’

Dining room: Those lucky enough to be invited are treated to Central Park views while they eat

Playful: Brazilian cherry wood hugs the floors and flamed black granite accents peek out throughout the home

So both the compliments and hefty dividends, like those driver has been earning for years, will be well-deserved.

And before you ask why the couple wants to leave the breathtaking condominium, agent Nora Ariffin of Halstead Property has an answer, straight Gordon himself.

She said the stock car legend has chosen now as a time to sell because 'the demand for trophy apartments is pretty strong.'

Sensible: The unlikely Central Park West dweller usually calls North Carolina home and reportedly wants to unload the place because 'demand for trophy apartments is pretty strong'
