With DNA and computer records, policing has come a long way in the last century. But one thing remains eerily similar - the humble mugshot.

These 1880s photographs were among the first of their kind, showing a host of sepia-printed criminals staring into the camera and holding up their hands to show tattoos or missing digits.

Inspired by the work of French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon, who was the first to take 'standardised' photographs so convicts could be told apart, the images feature in a new exhibition which documents our fascination with forensic science.

Eerie: These mugshots, taken from 1883 to 1889 at an unknown prison, are among the first of their kind. The technique of standardising photos - with similar clothes and background to spot distinguishing features - was pioneered by the French criminologist Alphonse Bertillon

Flip book: An photofit book from 1970 provided by the Metropolitan Police. In 1938 Jacques Penry, a facial topographer, began to develop a system of illustrations to identify facial features, which later became a bank of photographic images used to help witnesses record the details of suspects. This system replaced the ‘Identikit’ that used line drawings on overlaid acetate sheets, and gradually expanded as more police forces introduced the system. For instance, the selection of white male features comprised 204 different foreheads and hairstyles

Cracked: The fractured skull of a murder victim who suffered repeated blows with a blunt instrument sometime in the 1960s and reconstructed

Behind every crime is a trail of evidence, of shattered bones, bloodied tiles, empty shell casings, of sketches and mugshots. Physical remnants of foul deeds, waiting to be found and pieced together to convict the guilty.

This is the stuff of forensic science, and now the exhibition in central London has honed in on the fascination by showcasing a collection of original evidence, footage and instruments from real cases throughout history.

'Forensics: The Anatomy of Crime', which opens at the Wellcome Collection this week, includes the shattered skull of a murder victim, a brain damaged by bullet holes and a floor where a murdered man was found. 

Visitors are also able to walk into a working mortuary fridge, read original autopsy index cards and view a bullet used in a suicidal shooting - as well as the fatal wound it caused. 

In one installation, visitors will be confronted with the sounds from an autopsy of a murder victim and view the tools used by pathologists.  

The spring exhibition also features sketches from the site of a murder attributed to Jack the Ripper as well as authentic weapons used in a murder. 

Skeleton: These bones are from an installation by Jenny Holzer named Lustmord, which means sexual murder involving rape in German. It consists of 312 bones and 33 engraved with silver rings engraved with lines from a text and present three perspectives on sexual violence: those of the perpetrator, the victim and observer. They were made during the conflict in Yugoslavia and signify the acute physical and psychological damage caused by major war crimes and human rights abuses in 1994

Crime scene: These 105 ceramic tiles and concrete floor was the site of the murder of Luis Miguel Suro, the artist friend of Teresa Margolles - who spent several years working the morgue in Mexico City and is concerned with the consequences of widespread violence in Mexico. He was murdered Guadalajara, Mexico in 2004, but the motive is not known

These two sections of human brain (left) are from a young man who committed suicide by shooting himself through the temple. He lived for two days but died from his injuries in the 1960s. The specimens show that the bullet created a blood track through both brain hemispheres, causing associated haemorrhage. The skull (right) is one of the many authentic human remains on display at the forensic exhibition in London

This exhibit shows the bullet from a suicide shot and the flesh wound (inside box, left) in the 1960s. When a bullet passes through the body, heat from the gun’s discharge causes cauterisation, creating blackened area around the wound. The two segments of scalp show the entry and exit wounds, along with the offending bullet, which passed through the man’s head and subsequently became lodged in a nearby wall. The large-calibre bullet (0.455) was fired from a Webley MK VI service revolver

Mexican artist Teresa Margolles has displayed a section of the tiled floor on which her close friend was found murdered. The crime scene 'signifies the absence of the person and emphasises loss', according to the Wellcome Collection. 

The gallery is divided into five sections including 'The Crime Scene', which investigates the different techniques of recording the location of a crime and its power both as a repository of evidence to be examined and a haunting site of memory.

This department also includes the work of Mr Bertillon, whose 'God's Eye View' format, taken from above, brought rigour to the field. He also standardised the method of taking the criminal's photograph face on and in profile, which would be added to their file card.

Ken Arnold, head of public programmes at the Wellcome Collection, which recently underwent a £17.5million said: 'Forensics reminds us of the human body's extraordinary capacity to leave traces beyond death and disappearance.

Visitors are also able to walk into a mortuary fridge, part of an artwork by Sejla Kameric exploring the missing victims of the Bosnian war of 1992-5. They can also hear the sounds from a real life autopsy and view tools used by pathologists 

'Forensics: The Anatomy of Crime' opens at the Wellcome Collection this week and includes this working morgue refrigerator. From a space for viewing corpses in Paris (the word morgue comes from morguer, ‘to peer’) to the virtual autopsies afforded by MRI, CT and 3D scanning, the morgue offers a vital space for questioning the dead 

These forensic instruments would have once been used in post-mortems but are now on display for the public in a free exhibition on Friday

The display allows members of the public to see first hand the evidence from what happens after a victim dies, to how the perpetrator is caught

'This unsettling truth is both the focus of an astonishing range of scientific enquiry and fertile territory for the cultural imagination.' 

Lucy Shanahan, curator, said: 'This exhibition gives alternative views of the forensic process from the CSI detections of popular fiction and television, whilst exploring the cultural fascination that the disciplines of forensic medicine inspire. 

'Our journey from crime scene to courtroom takes in pioneers of scientific techniques that have revolutionised the way in which crimes are investigated, and offers visitors unexpected encounters with the changing relationship between medicine, law and society.'

The free exhibition opens Thursday and runs to June 21. 

These autopsy notes are from celebrity pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury, and have been displayed for the first time at the new exhibition

This book, 'Murder the Result of Various Injuries: Atlas of Legal Medicine', was written by Eduard Rittervon Hofmann in 1898. It explains that in an external examination the surface of the body is inspected and any irregular signs, scars, lesions or abnormalities as a result of disease or trauma are noted. In addition, the appearance of livor mortis – discolouration caused by the settling of blood under the skin – is assessed. Also known as lividity orhypostasis, this transformation is usually apparent half an hour to two hours after death, fully developing within 12 hours

The gallery is divided into five sections including 'The Crime Scene', which investigates the different techniques of recording the location of a crime and its power both as a repository of evidence to be examined and a haunting site of memory

From the Romanforum to the Old Bailey the exhibition closes with the space which brings together themany strands of forensic medicine, either as a conclusion to an investigation, or tocontest previous convictions

The free public gallery opens on Thursday at the Wellcome Collection in central London and will be on display until June 21. Pictured, the art installation entitled Lustmord by Jenny Holzer
