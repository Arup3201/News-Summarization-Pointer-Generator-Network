UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon has asked U2 frontman Bono to join the fight against Ebola - by putting on a concert to raise money to battle the virus.

He made the plea as it was revealed a trust fund he launched to provide fast and flexible funding for the fight against Ebola has only $100,000 (£62,000) in the bank.

The fund, which is part of a $1 billion (£620 million) UN appeal for humanitarian needs in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, is intended to provide fast and flexible funding to respond to the medical emergency.

But as it became clear its funds would do little alone to stem the spread of the killer virus, Mr Ban revealed he was considering alternative measures.

'I would welcome any initiative taken by Mr. Bono or some other leaders around the world to join this campaign to mobilize funds and mobilize awareness to take urgent action all together and to show solidarity,' Ban said. 

It comes as it emerged UK Prime Minister David Cameron will use an EU summit in Brussels next week to push for more funding and assistance for the poverty-stricken countries on the frontline of the Ebola outbreak.

And US Secretary of State John Kerry pleaded with diplomats on Friday to rush more money and supplies to battle Ebola in West Africa, calling it 'a real test of global citizenship.' 

The Royal Navy medical ship RFA Argus, with a fully-equipped 100-bed hospital on board, is setting sail from Cornwall to join the humanitarian effort and is due to reach West Africa by the end of the month with 225 military personnel from a total planned UK deployment of 750.

British Army medics arrived in Sierra Leone yesterday to work at a UK-supported treatment centre, which has 12 of its 92 beds set aside for healthcare workers who risk infection while treating others.

The World Health Organisation has reported a total of 8,997 cases of Ebola, including 4,493 deaths up to the end of October 12, the vast majority of them in the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

Premier League clubs have said their doctors will closely monitor players who are returning from African Nations Cup qualifiers. 

Mr Ban said last night that a 'huge and urgent global response' was needed and that countries which have 'the capacity' should provide funding now.'

'I believe that it is time that those other countries who really have the capacity, provide financial support and other logistical support,' said the UN Secretary General.

'This is quite serious. We need an urgent global response and support.'

Some $20 million (£12.4 million) have been pledged to Mr Ban's trust fund, but only $100,000 has actually been received.

The wider UN appeal has received $376 million (£234 million) in pledges - about 38% of the amount sought - though some countries are also providing help directly to affected countries and humanitarian agencies.

Mr Ban's predecessor as secretary general Kofi Annan has said he is 'bitterly disappointed' at the scale and speed of the international community's response to the crisis.

'If the crisis had hit some other region it probably would have been handled very differently,' Mr Annan told BBC2's Newsnight. 

'In fact when you look at the evolution of the crisis, the international community really woke up when the disease got to America and Europe.

'And yet we should have known that in this interconnected world it was only a matter of time.

'I point the finger of blame at the governments with capacity ... I think there's enough blame to go around.'

The British and US governments are ramping up diplomatic efforts to get more money and resources from the international community to fight Ebola

Mr Cameron has urged other European countries to introduce Ebola screening regimes at airports, warning they 'must do more' to halt the spread of the killer disease.

At Thursday's Cobra meeting the Prime Minister voiced doubts about the quality of protection in place in Europe, saying other governments should emulate the checks brought in by the UK.

A Downing Street spokesman said the meeting heard that the chief medical officer still regarded the risk to the UK as 'low'.

UK pharmaceuticals firm GlaxoSmithKline is trying to fast-track a vaccine for Ebola.

But the company's head of Ebola vaccine research said it would come too late for the current epidemic.

Dr Ripley Ballou told BBC Radio 4's File on Four: 'To have a vaccine that people can use, you have to have the vaccine registered and it has to be manufactured on a scale that is consistent with the intended use.

'It is going to be well into next year if not the year beyond before we have that kind of level of manufacturing and the data that is necessary ... The vaccine is going to come too late for this epidemic.'

US president Barack Obama has given the go-ahead to the Pentagon to call up reserve and National Guard troops if they are needed to help fight the disease in West Africa, and said he may appoint someone specifically to head America's response to the virus.

The US has faced criticism after Amber Joy Vinson, a nurse with Ebola, was allowed to board a flight from Ohio to Texas despite telling officials she had a fever.

Senator Kerry said the UN has raised barely a third of the $1billion needed for Ebola, and asked diplomats attending a State Department gathering on Friday for their nations to send more cash, trucks, helicopters, hospital equipment, generators and incinerators.

'Meeting this crisis is going to require that we draw on each other's collective experience and our collective capacities,' he said. 'No one country, no individual group of nations is going to resolve this problem by themselves. This is going to take a collective,  global response, all hands on deck.'
