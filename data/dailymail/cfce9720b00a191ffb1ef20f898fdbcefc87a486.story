Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud will return to first team training next week after stepping up his comeback from a broken leg.

Arsene Wenger has revealed Giroud is ahead of schedule as the 28-year-old was originally supposed to be out until the new year.

Giroud, who broke his leg in August while playing against Everton, has played just four games for the Gunners so far this season.

Mikel Arteta will miss his side's match against Swansea while Jack Wilshere could return 

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta has been ruled out of his side's Premier League encounter against Swansea after sustaining a hamstring injury in midweek.

Wenger, speaking to Arsenal's official website, said: 'Arteta will be out for Sunday. He has a mild hamstring strain and he will be out for a short period because it's a grade one. He should be back after the internationals.'

Arteta's fellow central midfielder Jack Wilshere will be back in Arsenal's squad for their visit to the Liberty Stadium.

'Jack is alright, he is back in the squad for Sunday,' added Wenger.

'Laurent Koscielny has a little chance to be back after the international break.

'Mathieu Debuchy, David Ospina and Mesut Ozil are progressing very well, but of course they are not available before or straight after the international break.'

Laurent Koscielny has a 'little chance' of returning after the international break, according to Arsene Wenger
