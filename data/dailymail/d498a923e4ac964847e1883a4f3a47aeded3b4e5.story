The Utah mother who allegedly killed six of her newborn babies before stashing their bodies in her garage has pleaded guilty to six counts of murder.

Megan Huntsman, 39, appeared in court in Provo on Thursday and faces between five years and life in prison for each murder when she is sentenced on April 20.

In exchange for the guilty pleas, prosecutors said they will recommend that her sentences run concurrently - but the Utah County Attorney's Office still expects she will spend the rest of her life behind bars, the Deseret News reported.

Prosecutors had called it a unique case in both its heinousness and in the number of victims.

The deaths sent shockwaves through the quiet, mostly Mormon community where Huntsman stored the tiny bodies for more than a decade after strangling the newborns.

Her estranged husband, Darren West, made the grisly discovery in April 2014 while he cleaned out a garage in the home they had shared in Pleasant Grove, just south of Salt Lake City.

He called police to report finding a dead infant in a small white box covered with electrician's tape, and they ultimately found six other bodies. Authorities say the seventh child had been a stillborn.

Huntsman told police she either strangled or suffocated the babies immediately after they were born. She wrapped their bodies in a towel or a shirt, put them in plastic bags and then packed them inside boxes in the garage.

Police say Huntsman killed the babies over a 10-year period from 1996 to 2006, during a period of her life when she told investigators she was addicted to methamphetamine and didn't want to care for the babies.

DNA results have revealed that all seven newborns were full term and that West was the biological father of the infants.

West lived with her during the decade the babies were killed, but he is not considered a suspect in their deaths.

West discovered the bodies shortly after he was released from federal prison where he spent more than eight years after pleading guilty to meth charges.

In her few brief court appearances, Huntsman has said very little.

The day the babies were found, Huntsman told police that were eight or nine dead babies in her home, search warrant affidavit show. But police later concluded Huntsman was confused and was taking a ballpark guess.
