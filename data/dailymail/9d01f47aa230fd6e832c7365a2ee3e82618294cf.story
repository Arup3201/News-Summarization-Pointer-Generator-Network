While Rory McIlroy was forced to put his champagne on ice in Dubai, Ian Poulter was seething in the rain in Turkey.

For two rounds Poulter had looked to be back to his best after a horrible year, with a lead at one stage of six shots at the Turkish Airlines Open.

On Saturday, he produced what he described as a ‘c**p’ performance, shooting a three-over-par 75 that left him level with Lee Westwood and a shot behind Australia’s Wade Ormsby, who leads on 12 under.

More relevant to McIlroy’s interests is the fact that Poulter’s drop in pace allowed Marcel Siem back into contention, with the German also at 11 under par. That raises the possibility of Siem winning the storm-ravaged tournament on Sunday, which would threaten McIlroy’s coronation as the Race to Dubai champion.

Siem remains one of only three players - along with Jamie Donaldson and Sergio Garcia, who are respectively 10 and eight shots off the lead here - with a mathematical chance of stopping the Northern Irishman from winning his second Race crown in three years.

But to do so Siem needs to wins both this event and the season-ending tournament in Dubai next week, where McIlroy would need to finish outside the top 17. McIlroy is currently practising in Dubai ahead of his return to competitive golf after more than a month off, which has been spent preparing for the trial over his legal dispute with his former management company.

Poulter’s concerns were closer to home after a round containing three bogeys and a double at 15 when he miscalculated with a wedge and hit a tree. He has seemingly turned a corner after plummeting from 12th to 44th in the world rankings this year, but was furious about his performance.

He said: ‘It was c**p. I’m going to get my head down and do the job. It was really disappointing to be out of rhythm after playing such great golf. As good as it was for two days, this was as poor as it was and disappointing.

‘It’s brought obviously a lot of players back into the fray. Their dinner is going to taste lovely and mine is going to taste horrible.’

Westwood, who shot a brilliant five-under-par 67 after his own struggles this season, said: ‘I’m just going to be enjoying being in contention really. It’s been a while since I’ve been up there, and I know what to do. Just enjoy it and enjoy playing well again.’

England’s Danny Willett is at 10 under, while 48-year-old John Daly is in the frame at eight under.
