This is the moment dozens of buffalo confronted a pride of lions in a desperate bid to rescue a small member of the herd.

The buffalo were captured approaching the big cats after they had taken down a calf at Londolozi Game Reserve in Skukuza, South Africa.

They could be seen running towards the lions as they tore at their prey's flesh, before tackling them with their horns.

They were then involved in a standoff with the large predators, which saw the two sides repeatedly confront each other, before backing off.

Finally, the buffalo succeeded in reaching their young one - but their bravery was for nothing as they could not revive the calf.

The dramatic incident was captured on video by an explorer at the wildlife reserve, bordering Kruger National Park.

Footage shows the lions, members of the Sparta pride, chasing after the buffalo, before pouncing on the youngest, slowest member of the herd.

Desperate: Finally, the buffalo managed to reach the fallen calf - and desperately tugged at its body and face (pictured) in an attempt to revive it. But despite their efforts, the animal remained motionless on the ground

All over: The buffalo eventually accepted their young one was dead and moved away to allow the lions to feed
