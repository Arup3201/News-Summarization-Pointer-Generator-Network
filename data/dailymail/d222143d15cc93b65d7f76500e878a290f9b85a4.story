Air passengers are paying up to eight times as much for their seats as the person sitting next to them - including in coach class.

Fliers are routinely being ripped off if they book a route which is popular with business travellers even if they are using it for a holiday.

A study found that as a result air passengers were paying up to $1,200 (£710) more than they should on a flight that took just one hour.

The findings will likely enrage consumers who are nowadays being forced to pay for many things that once came a standard.

Airlines like Ryanair routinely hit passengers with hidden fees of $17 (£10) per trip and $120 (£70) for checking in at the airport.

The study looked at flights in the US and found that some airlines had a greater price disparity between the lowest fares and the highest than others.

Fares varied the least on Spirit Airlines, five per cent. On Virgin America they had a 15 per cent disparity, and United Airlines had 18 per cent variability.

The study also looked at the amount it cost you if you booked the wrong seat.

Flying between Los Angeles and Las Vegas,
 a one hour journey, the highest paid for a seat in coach was $1,400 (£830) and 
the cheapest was $200 (£120), a difference of $1,200 (£710).

Other fares were not so high in monetary terms but up to eight times more than the lowest seat.

Overall, the study showed that flights to popular destinations like Hawaii were not so likely to have a price variability because consumers are more willing to switch to another airline.

However trips to Washington DC and Chicago changed more because business travellers had to take them regardless, meaning the airlines could take advantage of them.

The study was compiled by travel website Hopper.com, which advised passengers to book early and watch prices closely.

Hopper.com analysed flight data using its own software which monitors 10million flight requests a day. The survey was carried out at the start of May.
