The woman at the centre of a 'too fat to fly' controversy has announced that she is suing Southwest Airlines, which refused to allow her on a flight because of her size.

New Orleans resident Kenlie Tiggeman is taking on the airlines controversial 'Customers of Size' policy which requires passengers to buy a second seat if they can't fit between the 17-inch wide armrests.

In her quest to seek an injunction against the Dallas-headquartered carrier, Ms Tiggeman alleges that Southwest ignored her 'constitutional rights' and demonstrates 'discriminatory actions towards obese customers'.

Too fat to fly? Kenlie Tiggeman is suing Southwest Airlines after being told she was too large to have only one seat for the second time in six months

Conflict: Ms Tiggeman, left, now 120lbs lighter, was on a layover with her mother, Joan Charpentier, right, when they said they were singled out by an official in front of some 100 other passengers because of their size

Should airline passengers be required to buy a second seat if they can't fit between 17-inch wide armrests?

While she is not seeking monetary damages from the airline, Ms Tiggeman has claimed that she wants to enact an industry wide standard for rules to be put in place clearly stating the official policy of all U.S air companies.

'We need to know what the rules are,' she said.

'We need to know if we need one seat or two, because this eyeballing happening at the gate is incredibly discriminatory, and it's so unnecessary.'

Ms Tiggeman rose to national 
prominence last year when a Southwest Airlines employee declared that 
she was 'too fat to fly,' and asked her to buy a second seat.

The political strategist, along with her mother, Joan Charpentier, were on a layover in Dallas 
when they said they were singled out by an official in front of some 100
other passengers because of their size.

'The gate agent came up to me and he asked me how much I weighed, what size clothes I wore,' Ms Tiggeman told ABC News.

'He said that I was too fat to fly, that I would need an additional seat, and he was really sort of crass about the whole thing.'

She added: 'There was no privacy.'

Weigh in: Southwest says any passenger who cannot fit comfortably in their 17-inch seats with both armrests down must purchase another seat

Policy: More than 90 per cent of the time, 'customers of size' receive a refund for their second seat, a Southwest spokesperson said

At the time, Ms Tiggeman said she weighed between 240 and 300 pounds. She said the agent 'didn't know what the policy was,' so a supervisor was brought in to assess the situation.

According to Southwest’s website, the definitive gauge for a Customer of Size is fairly simple – the armrest. ‘It serves as the boundary between seats, which measure 17 inches wide. Customers who are unable to lower both armrests and/or who encroach upon any portion of the adjacent seat should proactively book the number of seats needed prior to travel.’

Southwest requested that its employees use sensitivity when addressing customers of size, noting it’s difficult to hold a private conversation in a crowded airport.

The airline encourages passengers to proactively purchase additional seats, the website reads, in order to avoid ‘embarrassing conversations.’

The airline said that in 98 per cent of cases, the customer of size may obtain a refund because the flight is not full.

However, the supervisor was unaware of the airline's policy as well, Ms Tiggeman said.

Following the incident, which Tiggeman blogged about on her website alltheweigh.com, a Southwest executive apologised, refunded her ticket, and offered flight vouchers.

Flying on the same airline twice more Tiggeman suffered no more embarrassments until Thanksgiving last year when she had to go through a similar experience.

'Something has to change. I just need some consistency,' said Tiggeman to WDSU.com.

Responding to the impending law-suit, a spokesman for Southwest Airlines offered some advice.

'The best case scenario is for the customer to notify us of any special needs ahead of time,' said Brandy King.

'If providing the additional seat does not result in our having to deny another customer boarding, we will refund the ticket to the customer at no charge, which happens more than 90 percent of the time.'

In fact, the airline said on their website that in 98 per cent of cases, the customer of size may obtain a refund because the flight is not full.

Struggle: For Ms Tiggeman, pictured three years ago when she weighed 400lbs, the two incidents with Southwest Airlines were hurtful after she battled hard to lose weight

Wide load? Director Kevin Smith was famously asked to leave a 2010 Southwest flight

In February 2010, director Kevin Smith famously was told he was ‘too wide for the sky.’ According to his Twitter feed, he was removed from the Southwest flight because he was deemed a safety risk. The Jay and Silent Bob director was given a $100 voucher by the airline and boarded another flight. Southwest later reached out to apologise. 

The airline also booted a thin flier from one of their seats in July of 2010 on a Las Vegas-to-Sacramento flight so an obese 14-year-old could have her seat. ‘It didn’t seem right that I should have to leave to accommodate someone who had only paid for one seat,’ she told the Sacramento Bee at the time. 

A Southwest spokesperson later told the Bee: ‘We know this was awkward and we should have handled it better.’ The airline later apologised to the woman.

At the time of the incident, 
Southwest said they clearly stated in their ‘Customers of Size’ policy 
that passengers who cannot fit within the 17-inch armrests must purchase
an additional seat.

According to Southwest’s website, the
definitive gauge for a Customer of Size is fairly simple – the armrest.
‘It serves as the boundary between seats, which measure 17 inches wide.

'Customers who are unable to lower 
both armrests and/or who encroach upon any portion of the adjacent seat 
should proactively book the number of seats needed prior to travel.’

Southwest requested that its 
employees use sensitivity when addressing customers of size, noting it’s
difficult to hold a private conversation in a crowded airport.

The airline encourages passengers to 
proactively purchase additional seats, the website reads, in order to 
avoid ‘embarrassing conversations.’

While Tiggeman's crusade continues many passengers feel that they are being attacked by airlines.

Spirit Airlines announced this week that passengers might have to pay up to $100 for a carry-on bag, meaning any larger hand luggage could be charged for.

However, the issue of size and passengers is clearly still emotive.

'I don't want the person next to me on top of my seat, or coming underneath the armrest because I've paid for my whole seat,' said MeMe Roth, the founder of National Action against Obesity.

On the flip-side, Brandon Macsata, a passenger rights spokesman wants greater acceptance shown to overweight people.

'These aren't durable goods being shipped from point A to point B,' said Macsata.

'This isn't cattle being shipped to a livestock farm.'

While her suit against Southwest Airlines continues, Tiggeman wants it to be known that she isn't an advocate for obesity.

In fact, her blog records her current weight loss which at the moment is over 100 pounds down from what it was in April 2011.

'While we may not be born with an innate privilege of flying on a plane, as paying consumers we do have the right to fly if we’re willing to follow the rules,' said Tiggeman.

'And in order to do that, we need to know the rules.'
