A 23-year-old man accused of causing £20,000 of damage to the Houses of Parliament during an eight-hour stand-off on the roof has appeared in court today. 

Braydon Liam Anderson, 23, allegedly smashed a stain glass window, broke an ornamental crown and a CCTV camera and pulled valuable brickwork and masonry off the historic landmark. 

It sparked a major security alert on Saturday night with police, fire engines and specialist negotiators scrambled to the scene.

Braydon Liam Anderson, 23, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court today accused of causing £20,000 of damage to the Houses of Parliament after he gained access to the roof on Saturday evening

Izolda Switala-Gribbin, for the prosecution, told Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'Mr Anderson gained access to the roof of the House of Commons and he was first seen at the top of the roof at about 9.14pm in the evening.

'Police were called as there were serious concerns about Mr Anderson's safety.

'Two police officers gained access to the roof, where Mr Anderson was in the process of smashing windows and causing criminal damage.

'When he was asked how he gained access to the roof, he simply stated "by magic" to the officer.

'He indicated if the officers approached, it will not end well and went on to say "today's the day".

'After he finished smashing windows, he told the officers he'd had enough and was ready to leave and restated "today's the day to leave".

'Eventually when Mr Anderson fell asleep, the officers attempted to restrained him and managed to arrest him at 5.15am on Sunday morning.'

Ms Switala-Gribbin said the damage was estimated to be in the region of £10,000 and £20,000 and included a 'stained glass window, ornamental crown, and CCTV camera'.

Anderson was charged on Sunday after tourists reported seeing a man walking up and down the roof for hours. It is still unclear how he gained access. 

The standoff came after around 5,000 climate change protesters gathered outside Parliament on Saturday afternoon, although it has not been confirmed if he attended. 

Police, fire crews and specialist negotiators were sent to the Houses of Parliament to try and bring him down, watched by crowds who had gathered below.   

Anderson appeared in the dock at Westminster Magistrates Court today charged with criminal damage and trespass on a protect site.

Wearing a grey prison issue tracksuit, Anderson was supported from the public gallery by his sister Charmaine.

Anderson, who is from Northampton but works in the West End as a rickshaw driver, had only recently returned from a month of travelling to Spain and Morocco. 

Aurindam Majumdar, defending, said Anderson's sister was in court as she was 'very concerned about her brother's wellbeing'.

But Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle remanded Anderson in custody until tomorrow, when he is due to see the court's in-house psychiatrist.

The judge also said consent had to be sought from the Attorney General for the charge of trespassing on a protected site to be brought.

Anderson became visibly distressed when he was told he would be remanded in custody for the night.

He shouted out: 'It's my right to protest' as he was led away to the cells.

Anderson, of Portland Place, Northampton, is accused of trespass on a protected site and criminal damage.

He has not yet entered any pleas.
