Karl Albrecht, co-founder of the Aldi supermarket empire and one of the world's richest men, has died aged 94

Karl Albrecht, co-founder of the Aldi grocery store empire and one of the world's richest people, has died  at the age of 94.

He was buried on Monday in a family plot in a small ceremony in the western German city of Essen, where he lived.

Albrecht and his brother Theo built up the business from nothing after returning home from the war and selling bread and milk cheaply from the family's small shop.

Aldi spokeswoman Kirsten Gess said in a statement: 'He created a corporate culture of mutual respect, he trusted his employees and their talents, and he gave them a chance to use them. Our sympathies are with his family.'

Albrecht and his brother, who died in 2010, shunned publicity throughout their lives, and when Forbes featured them in 1992 as two of the world's richest men, it had to use silhouettes to illustrate the article because no pictures of them had been published for years.

Albrecht was ranked No. 24 on this year's Forbes list of the world's richest people with an estimated net worth of £15 billion.

Both brothers worked in their parents' grocery store as they were growing up.

After both serving as German soldiers in the Second World War, the brothers took over the business and began a rapid expansion. By early 1960 they were operating some 300 stores.

After splitting the company into two, the brothers in 1962 rebranded the group Aldi — a contraction of 'Albrecht Discount' — with Karl Albrecht leading Aldi South, and Theo Albrecht taking Aldi North.

They still worked together, using their combined bargaining power to negotiate lower purchasing prices.

Their motto was 'concentrating on the basics: a limited selection of goods for daily needs' and their formula sold well.

He once said: 'What you want to achieve is that the customer believes there is nowhere cheaper to shop.' 

Today the group has around 10,000 stores in 17 countries in Europe, North America and Australia, and a family trust established by Theo Albrecht in 1979 bought the U.S. specialty grocery chain Trader Joe's. It made £29billion in 2013.

Karl Albrecht is survived by a son, Karl Junior, and a daughter, Beate. His wife of 67 years, Mia, died in 2013.

The  chain has taken the world by storm and now has 10,000 stores around the globe with 500 in the UK
