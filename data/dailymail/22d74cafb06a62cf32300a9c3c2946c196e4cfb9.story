The mother of one of Bill Cosby's accusers has penned a letter to his wife Camille, pleading for her to speak 'the truth'.

Judy Thompson, whose 44-year-old daughter Jennifer Thompson claimed she fended off unwanted advances from Cosby as a teenager, sent the letter to Mrs Cosby three weeks ago.

'It was mother to mother,' she said. 'This letter was written from my heart.'

Judy Thompson, who has yet to hear back from Mrs Cosby, said she was inspired to write the letter after she read Camille Cosby's statement issued in December suggesting that her husband, not the women, is the party being harmed by the allegations.

'None of us will ever want to be in the position of attacking a victim,' Camille Cosby said. 'But the question should be asked - who is the victim?'

Judy Thompson bristled when she read the words. She said she watched her daughter go from a sparkling, ambitious teen to a woman 'with an inner light extinguished' after the incident in the 1980s.

Only recently has Jennifer Thompson emerged from under 'the dark cloud,' said Judy Thompson, who included a Psalms prayer in the letter.

'Your husband crossed boundaries that never should have been breached,' she wrote to Camille Cosby. 'He shattered her innocence.'

Judy Thompson said she prays daily for the Cosbys and ended the letter by writing, 'May you and Bill speak the truth and be afforded peace for your souls.' 

Mrs Thompson and her husband, William Thompson, met with Bill Cosby in the late 1980s to discuss their teen daughter's modeling and acting career and said they felt immediately at ease.

Mrs Thompson said she was inspired to write the letter from 'mother to mother' after Camille Cosby suggested her husband was the real victim in a statement last December.

'Your husband crossed boundaries that never should have been breached,' Mrs Thompson wrote. 'He shattered her innocence.'

She added that no one believed her daughter's claims. 

'To be so hurt and violated, and then not be believed! Resolution has not been easily forthcoming. We all remained in the shadows of your husband's sick behavior.'

Judy Thompson said she prays daily for the Cosbys and included a Psalm in the letter.

She ended by writing: 'May you and Bill speak the truth and be afforded peace for your souls.'

Cosby reassured the Thompsons that their then-17-year-old daughter would be fine living in an apartment with other models as she launched her career. He promised to help the teen, they said. 

'We thought we were talking to Dr. Huxtable,' said William Thompson, referring to the comedian's TV persona in 'The Cosby Show'.

Jennifer Thompson now says she fended off unwanted sexual advances from Cosby and once performed a sex act on the comedian. He then gave her $700.

She said that she felt he kept pushing her to return to his apartment with him.

'He said, "And then after the dinner, you can just come back here because you'll be tired"... and I knew right away then - it was clear that this is what had to happen for me to do anything in this industry with him,' she said. 

The encounter clouded Jennifer Thompson's next two decades.

'It basically shattered my faith so that anything that used to look promising to me, I saw it through a different lens,' she said.

Judy Thompson said that it was difficult to find anyone, even a therapist, who would believe her daughter's story. She didn't go to police. 

'To be so hurt and violated, and then not be believed!' she wrote in her letter. 'Resolution has not been easily forthcoming. We all remained in the shadows of your husband's sick behavior.'

Jennifer Thompson was one 13 so-called 'Jane Does' in a 2005 civil suit that was brought by a woman named Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee who claimed Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in 2004.

Constand later settled out of court and Thompson and the other women did not testify in the case.

More than 20 women have stepped forward in recent months to level various accusations against Cosby, ranging from unwanted advances to sexual assault and rape.

Additionally, Cosby is being sued by three women for defamation and by another woman who says he molested her when she was 15. 

Not backing down: Cosby released a 10-second video on Monday, pictured, to promote his upcoming show in West Virginia. He also released a message saying: 'Hey, hey, hey, I'm far from finished'

Cosby has not been charged with any crime, and neither Cosby's lawyer nor his spokesman returned calls seeking comment. Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, previously has denied some of the allegations and made no comment on others. 

On Monday, Cosby released a new video message, his first in months.

He doesn't discuss the allegations and in the short video, promoted his Saturday show in Wheeling, West Virginia, the next stop in Cosby's stand-up comedy tour.

'You know I'll be hilarious,' Cosby said in the video. 'Can't wait.'

He also added a note to the video, which read: 'Dear fans, I hope you enjoy my wonderful video message that's filled with laughter... Hey, hey, hey, I'm far from finished.'
