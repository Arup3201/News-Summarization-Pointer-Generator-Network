Jose Mourinho took a swipe at Manchester City as Chelsea prepared for their trip to the Etihad Stadium, claiming UEFA must take points and titles from clubs who fail to comply with Financial Fair Play.

The Chelsea boss said it would be a fairer punishment than the fines and squad restrictions which City have faced this year.

‘Everybody knows there are fines and, if these fines exist, control exists,’ said Mourinho, in an interview with Portuguese broadcasters TVI. ‘But are fines fair? I don’t think so. In my opinion the first thing is to remove points and remove titles.

‘If you have important capital which allows you to overcome the FFP; if you win titles and then you are fined economically, you keep doing the same thing.’

Mourinho added with a shrug: ‘They will take from you one or two players from the Champions League list. Then, instead of 24, you go with 22. But if you’re stating that you will start the next Champions League with six points fewer, or you won’t play in the next edition of the Champions League and go into the Europa League instead, it’s more serious.’

UEFA punished City, Paris Saint-German and Zenit St Petersburg this year for breaking FFP rules. City were fined £50million — though this will be reduced if they comply in future — and they had their squad for this year’s Champions League campaign cut to 21 players.

After years of huge cash losses, Chelsea worked hard to comply with FFP and this week, chief executive Ron Gourlay admitted the club had changed its policy from the days when they were unashamedly bankrolled by Roman Abramovich. Gourlay says they now have to ‘chase the penny’.
