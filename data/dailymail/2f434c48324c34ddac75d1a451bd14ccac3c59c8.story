In a cryptic tweet, Elon Musk has announced the launch of a 'major' new line of products. The launch date coincides with the arrival of the stationary battery pack designed to power an entire home

The launch date coincides with the arrival of the stationary battery pack designed to power an entire home, according to The Verge. 

Last month, Musk said the unit would be ready for a public debut within months and that it should start going into production by the summer.

It is likely to build on the power packs used in Tesla’s range of electric cars such as the Model S.

‘We are going to unveil the Tesla home battery, the consumer battery that would be for use in people’s houses or businesses fairly soon,’ Mr Musk told analysts.

‘We have the design done, and it should start going into production in about six months or so.’

The Mirai features the Toyota Fuel Cell System, which combines fuel cell technology with hybrid technology.

The firm said it can serve as a 'high capacity power supply during emergencies'. 

The Mirai converts the DC power from the CHAdeMO power socket in the boot to AC power, using an attachment.

Toyota calls it a vehicle-to-home system. 

Tesla's home battery could work in a similar way, or be a standalone battery.  

He didn’t reveal what a home battery would be used for, but it could act as a generator during a power cut, for example.

Rival car manufacturer Toyota already uses a hydrogen fuel cell in its Mirai car that can be removed and used to power a home.

According to the Japanese car maker, the battery can supply electric power to an average home for a week. 

Last year, Tesla Motors unveiled plans for a $5billion ‘Gigafactory’ designed to help the firm ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars, and now homes.

Tesla said the factory will cut current battery production costs by up to 30 per cent, and will be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. 

Elsewhere, Mr Musk is already the chairman of SolarCity - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and Tesla's home battery could be an extension of this. 

Following today's announcement, Tesla stock jumped more than three per cent to over $190 per share.
