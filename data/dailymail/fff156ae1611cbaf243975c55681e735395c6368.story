A study has found people who are dating, in a serious relationship or co-habiting, are the most frequent sexters

Approximately 80 percent of 21-year-olds have received 'sext' messages, while just under 50 percent of young adults have shared nude or semi-nude photos of themselves using a smartphone, scientists said.

While some people might send a sext in the hope it will lead to a hook-up, a study has found people who are dating, in a serious relationship or co-habiting, are the most frequent sexters.

The results could mean couples are either spicing up their sex lives or cheating by sexting several people, but the research did find that single people and married couples sext least frequently.

The study said: 'Single individuals had significantly 
stronger negative expectancies about sending and receiving sexts 
compared to others who were in some romantic relationship.'

Scientists found sexting behaviour and the outcome people expect from sexting may differ depending on a person's gender, relationship status, and sexual identity.

The study, published in Cyberpsychology, Behaviour and Social Networking, said 80 percent of 21-year-olds have received sext messages, while 67 percent have sent them.

Around 46 percent of young people have sent revealing or nude photos of themselves to another person using a mobile phone, while 64 percent have received them.

Men were found to send more sexts, more frequently to more people, compared with women, according to the research by Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis, which questioned 611 university students, 42 percent of which said they were in serious relationships.

The study suggests women are less engaged with the joy of sexting than men.

Allyson Dir, author of the study, said females may be more pressured into sexting by male peers.

She believes more needs to be understood about the 
reasons for sexting and how these reasons influence participation in 
sexting behaviours for different individuals.

Writing in the journal, Ms Dir said: 'Much of our understanding about sexting comes from media and anecdotal reports about the dangers of sexting.'

'Negative beliefs about sexting include 
the potential for legal ramifications the risk of sexts being shared 
with others and the resulting cyberbullying social humiliation, and 
psychological distress.'

However as sexting is a prevalent behaviour among young people, there are potentially a number of positive outcomes from the activity, she said.

The study found 27 percent of people said sending sexts makes them feel desirable and excited, and the study foundÂ  young people mainly felt they were 'fun and flirataceous' or said sexts are a way of experimenting with their sexuality.

However,16 percent of people admitted to being embarrassed by sending sexts, perhaps indicating a level of peer pressure was involved.

The study suggests that women were less thrilled at receiving texts than men and had stronger negative experiences of sending and receiving sexts.

Approximately 37 percent of people said receiving a text made them feel 'uncomfortable' but 17 percent said it gave them confidence.

Interestingly, despite the fact the vast majority of the young people surveyed had received a sext message, individuals are not sexting frequently, with most sending less than three sexts a month.

Ms Dir said: 'These frequency rates are similar to 
what has been shown in previous samples of young adults, suggesting that
while many have experimented with sexting at least once, most 
individuals do not sext regularly.'

'Although individuals who sext more often
might be at a higher risk for negative outcomes simply due to 
probability, this does not mean that those sexting infrequently are not 
prone to risk.'

The study claims to be the first cross-sectional research of how sexting expectancies influence sexting behaviours, but its author admits the field has yet to fully understand expected sexting outcomes.
