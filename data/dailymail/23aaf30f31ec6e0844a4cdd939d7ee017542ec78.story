As Floyd Mayweather Jnr took in an NBA game on Thursday night the crowd left the pound-for-pound king under no illusions about which opponent they want to see him fight next.

Mayweather's presence at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles for the game between LA Clippers and Brooklyn Nets led to chants from supporters of 'we want Pacquiao, we want Pacquiao'.

Negotiations between the two fighters are ongoing as the boxing world waits with bated breath hoping for confirmation of the $200million mega fight that has been more than five years in the making.

Manny Pacquiao has already agreed terms for the most eagerly-awaited fight in boxing which has been penciled in for May 2 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

But the Filipino, who insists he has agreed to fight Mayweather on his own terms, is waiting on the undefeated American to commit to the bout.

Mayweather was joined at the LA Clippers game by Jay-Z and Beyonce and well-known celebrity pal Justin Beiber.

The Clippers recorded a comprehensive 123-84 victory against the Nets.
