Desperate refugees trying to cross the Sinai Desert are having their organs snatched while they are still alive by ruthless doctors, it has emerged.

Medics travel from Cairo to camps in the heart of the vast sands to harvest kidneys, livers, corneas and corneas from the helpless donors.

They then transport the organs back to Egypt in mobile refrigeration units where patients are waiting to receive them.

Thousands of refugees are believed to have died as a result of the operations, their bodies bearing tell-tale scars which show where the organs have been removed.

The illegal trade – believed to be the second most lucrative in the region behind weapons smuggling – has been exposed in a CNN documentary.

Death In The Desert, part of the network’s Freedom Project, reveals the plight of refugees from Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea crossing the Sinai in an attempt to reach Israel.

According to the report, refugees also face rape, extortion and slavery and are frequently held in labour camps in the lawless desert.

The Sinai Peninsula is under the control of Bedouin tribes, and police rarely ever venture into the area.

Smuggling and contraband is the main economy and when refugees put their trust into smugglers to get them across the border, they are instead being sold to the Bedouins and taken to labour camps.

Instead of making it to the Israeli border, they are held by the tribes – including the Sawarka - who try to extort huge sums of money from relatives they might have overseas.

If no ransom is received, the women are frequently raped while the men are tortured. Both sexes are usually enslaved and may have to work on marijuana plantations in the depths of the desert.They also face the terrible prospect of having their organs harvested.

‘Doctors from Cairo call me and say they have a private case and they need this or that,’ one Bedouin chief told CNN journalist Fred Pleitgen.

‘It’s like spare parts for a car. The doctors come with some sort of mobile fridge where the organs can be stored for six to eight hours and resold in Cairo or elsewhere.

‘They deal directly with the Sawarka tribe and they buy the organs for anything from 1,000 to 20,000 dollars’

The documentary crew was shown photographs of dead bodies laced with the scars from surgery by Hamdy Al Azazy, the head of the New Generation for Human Rights.

‘A few years ago I heard from one of the Bedouins about spare parts,’ he said.

‘But I couldn’t accept at that time, whether it is true or not. It is not logical for me because the spare body parts need high technology and special clinics.

‘But I didn’t know the technology has become very easy now because of mobile clinics.’

A forensic doctor who later examined the pictures said that the nature of the scars suggested the bodies were operated on while still alive.

He had no doubt that the organs were taken while the person was still alive.

Pleitgen said that the extent of the trade that the team had uncovered was staggering.

‘We’d actually gone to Sinai to do a completely different report,’ he said.

‘And then we were told that organ trafficking was going on. The trade is run by the tribes and the doctors are based in Cairo.’

The team attended a burial carried out by human rights workers while they were in Egypt. The bodies had simply been dumped with no clue to their identity.

‘The two guys were completely unknown,’ he said. ‘The cemetery was bleak, next to a garbage dump. Dogs have dug bodies up in the past.’

The documentary is part of the network’s Freedom Project, which was launched in March.

It is part of a global news initiative to expose and raise awareness of sex trafficking and slavery around the world.

Death In The Desert is one of more than 200 stories of human trafficking found by CNN, which spans five continents.

The documentary will be broadcast on November 19, 20 and 21st.
