Parents agonising over what to name their sons may wish to take note... researchers have revealed which names are most closely linked with success.

They found that men called John, David or Steve are more likely to do well in business than those called Tony, Matthew or Jimmy.

The study examined the connection between first names and the achievements of their bearers, discovering that Paul, Alan and Richard also have a better chance of striking it rich.

Name game: Researchers found that men called John, David or Steve are more likely to do well in business than those called Tony, Matthew or Jimmy. The late Steve Jobs, the former Apple CEO, was one such example

Men named Fred, Brian and Ben were amongst the least likely to hit the business big time, along with Ed and Alex.

Peter and Andrew have a good chance of doing well, unlike those going by Kevin and Sam.

A spokesman for domain name site Siteopia.com, which commissioned the study, said: ‘Although we shouldn’t do it, there is a tendency to make an assumption about someone, perhaps before we’ve even met them.

‘Traditional strong names seem to have more luck in business – even though we don’t get to choose our own first names.’

Barry, George and Harry, however, would probably do better to avoid entrepreneurship.

Giles is currently earning the highest annual salary, of more than £42,000, and Alex the lowest, at just over £22,000 a year. Gareth is also a high earner at £39,000 a year, as is Martin on nearly £36,000.

Nigel will have attended the most interviews and had an average of five rejections. Men named Justin are most likely to be regretting a business decision or career move.

Rick, Gary and Edward are also likely to have regrets about a past business choice or career change - and men called Rick are most likely to have lost a lot of money at some point in their career.

Alex, Ben and Matthew are most likely to be seen as creative, while men called Daniel have experienced the most luck.

The spokesman for Siteopia added: ‘So confident and attached to their name are they that some men have backed this up by naming their personal brands and websites after themselves.’
