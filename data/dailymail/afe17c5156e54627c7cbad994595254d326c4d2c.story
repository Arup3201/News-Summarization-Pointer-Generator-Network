An MP has been banned from Mumsnet after posting details online of a mother forced to give up her baby after a caesarean ordered by a secret court.

Lib Dem John Hemming said he had also been put on the ‘naughty step’ for revealing the identities of other users of the website.

The MP for Birmingham Yardley admitted using Mumsnet after drinking, writing on the site: ‘I am not sober, but I am right.’

Mr Hemming, a long-standing campaigner against secrecy, was an outspoken critic of the treatment of an Italian woman forced to have a caesarean against her wishes.

The newborn was taken into state care by Essex County Council on the orders of a judge in the notoriously secretive Court of Protection – despite the mother’s pleas to be allowed to raise her.

Mr Hemming inadvertently named the woman on Mumsnet after posting a transcript of court proceedings from Italy.

Under family law, all identities have 
to remain anonymous. Mumsnet deemed this a breach of its rules and Mr 
Hemming was banned just before Christmas.

He insisted he was not bothered by the suspension, which will be reviewed after a ‘cooling off period’.

Mr Hemming also incurred the wrath of 
Mumsnet after posting a link to the Twitter account of a user named 
‘spero’ which identified her as family lawyer Sarah Phillimore. It is 
against Mumsnet rules to name users.

Justine Roberts, CEO of Mumsnet, said: 'The naming of the Italian mother's children and the somewhat aggressive outing of another mumsnet user's identity led us to suspend John Hemming.

'We have received a number of complaints about the MP's posts and posting style over the years so we thought it appropriate that we should suspend his membership for a cooling off period.'

Mr Hemming, 53, said that he had inadvertently named the woman and her family involved in the Italian court case.

He added: ‘Although I do read Italian, I don't read it that well, and didn't realise there was an Italian court order in place.

‘As soon as I realised my error, I contacted Mumsnet and asked them to take the posts down.’

He also admitted he had been drinking 
while writing some posts. He said one night on the forum members 
questioned if he was ‘Mumsnetting under the influence’ and he replied: 
‘I am not sober, but I am right.’

He
 also admitted he had inadvertently revealed the identities of Mumsnet 
contributors by posting links to their Twitter accounts, which gave 
their real names.

‘I didn't realise it was against Mumsnet's rules and regulations, I haven't read them,’ he said.

But
 Mr Hemming said he was ‘not really that bothered’ about being banned. 
‘My eight-year-old daughter is thrilled I'm on the naughty step and if 
she's happy, I'm happy,’ he said.

Mumsnet said it would look again at Mr Hemming's use of the site after a cooling off period

A
 statement from Mumsnet said: ‘Although we don't formally verify the 
identity of our users, we believe that it is John Hemming MP posting on 
Mumsnet. He has been posting for some time.

‘Before
 Christmas, he was involved in a long discussion surrounding the forced 
Caesarian/adoption case. He posted a long transcript of Italian court 
proceedings which named some of the mother's children, which is in 
breach of UK reporting restrictions on the case. It was reported to us 
by John Hemming and by other users so in accordance with our guidelines,
 we deleted the post.

‘John 
Hemming was also reported for posting information that linked to Mumsnet
 users' real names, which is against our ethos (the vast majority of our
 members greatly value the anonymity of our site and value being able to
 keep their real life identity and MN identity separate), and so we 
suspended him from the site on 21/12/13.

‘After a cooling off period while we review the things that lead to the suspension we will decide on the best way forward.’

The mother in the Caesarian case Alessandra Pacchieri, 35, from Tuscany, can be named openly in the British media after a High Court judge refused a request from Essex County Council for a blanket ban on anything which could identify her.

MailOnline reported last month how she had written a poignant letter to her 'little Princess' promising never to forget her.
