A teacher whose phone was stolen then used to rack up £15,000 in bills by foreign thieves has been told by Vodafone that he must pay for the calls. 

Osian Rhys Edwards from Barmouth, Gwynedd, was on holiday in Barcelona in August when his phone was stolen after he asked for directions from locals. 

The 29-year-old phoned Vodafone to report the theft, but is now being held accountable for thousands of pounds as the company claims it has no record of his call.

Osian Rhys Edwards was told to pay the £15,000 bill despite claiming to report his phone stolen on the night of the theft

The primary school teacher now faces financial ruin after being told to hand over £15,000, including £2,500 in VAT. 

'It's clear that I have been the victim of fraudsters but Vodafone wants to hold me responsible. 

'I can't believe that this is allowed to happen. If I'd lost my bank cards, the banks would soon stop them when they spot unusual activity but even though I reported my phone stolen, Vodafone not only says I'm liable, but it is probably making money out this,' he told the Guardian. 

Records show that phone calls to two Spanish numbers at premium rates were made on the night of the theft. 

Shortly after the incident Mr Rhys Edwards says phoned Vodafone  from a payphone in Barcelona to cancel his contract.

But upon his return to the UK, he discovered the company had no record of the call. There is no hope of tracing the call now as logs are deleted after 60 days, the company said. 

While the provider has agreed to reduce the £15,031 bill by 30 per cent, it still holds him accountable for more than £10,000. 

'Despite not reporting the theft of his phone for four days, we have offered to reduce Mr Edwards' outstanding charges by 25%.

'In the light of our failure to call him back when we should have done, we will increase this offer to 30%.

The primary school teacher now faces financial ruin as despite the company reducing the bill by 30 per cent, he has been told to pay more than £10,000 

Pickpockets in the Catalan city target tourists and use their phones to place premium-rate calls before the handsets are blocked 

'We are also prepared to discuss a payment plan,' a spokesman said. 

Mr Rhys Edwards is the latest victim of pickpockets in the Catalan city who steal mobile phones and use them to place premium-rate calls in quick succession before the handset is blocked. 

Sarah Harvey, an NHS worker from Brighton, was told to settle a £5,800 bill run up after her phone was stolen in the same city.

Georgia Harris, a recruitment worker, was initially told to pay £21,000 after her phone was stolen in 2013. Vodafone later withdrew its demand she pay for the foreign calls. 

In 2012, the telecoms regulator Ofcom ordered mobile phone companies produce plans to cap customers' bills. 

But the plans were never produced, and the issue was handed to the government with which companies are thought to be in continuing discussions.
