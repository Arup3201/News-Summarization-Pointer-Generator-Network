Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi was reunited with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall on a visit to Britain today.

The Burmese opposition leader made a special request to see the royal couple on a tour which also saw her meet political leaders including Prime Minister David Cameron, Labour leader Ed Miliband and Foreign Secretary William Hague.

Mr Cameron backed her efforts to amend the Burmese constitution, which currently 
prevents her standing for president in 2015.

Aung San Suu Kyi met Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall at Clarence House during a visit to the UK

Earlier in the day, Charles and Camilla accompanied Ms Suu Kyi into the Garden Room at Charles's London home Clarence House and the Prince explained: 'There's endless people taking photographs.'

Ms Suu Kyi replied: 'You've got to obey the photographers.'

And the Prince assured her: 'That's by far the best policy.'

Ms Suu Kyi met the Royal couple shortly before they attended the christening of Prince George. 

She has close connections with Britain having read philosophy, politics and economics at St Hugh's College, Oxford, between 1964 and 1967, before settling in the university city with her late husband Michael Aris, a Tibetan scholar.

In July 1989, around a year after her return to her homeland to care for her mother, Ms Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest by the ruling military which feared the influence of a woman whose father was instrumental in gaining Burma's freedom from British rule.

She remained there for much of the next 20 years, finally being released in November 2010.

Her husband died of prostate cancer in 1999 at the age of 53. He had asked the Burmese authorities to grant him a visa to visit her one last time, but was refused.

Charles knew Mr Aris and the year the 
scholar died he became patron of the Michael Aris Memorial Trust for 
Tibetan and Himalayan Studies.

Charles and Ms Suu Kyi have another connection apart from his links to her late husband.

Lord Mountbatten, the prince's great uncle, and the campaigner's father, General Aung San, were involved in important events leading up to Burma's independence from British rule.

As supreme allied commander of South East Asia Lord Mountbatten held negotiations in 1943 with Aung San, Burma's war minister, who switched his country's military allegiance from Japan to Britain and helped the Allies defeat the Japanese in his homeland.

The general went on to play a crucial role in Burma becoming an independent nation before he was assassinated in 1947, months before independence was realised.

The Prime Minister, who said he was one of Ms Suu Kyi's 'greatest admirers', pledged to build international pressure for the constitutional changes.

Welcoming her to Downing Street, Mr Cameron said Britain would do 'everything we can' to support Ms Suu Kyi in her efforts to change the constitution, which will require the agreement of the current president Thein Sein and the military.

Suu Kyi later met David Cameron at Downing Street where he backed her calls for a change to the Burmese constitution

Mr Cameron said that some progress seen in Burma on human rights needs to be sustained

Mr Cameron said: 'You are hugely 
admired in this country, I am one of your greatest admirers - for 
everything that you have done for your country but also for everything 
you stand for in the world.

'Your example and your perseverance in your beliefs is a huge inspiration to people across Britain and people around the world.

'We wish you well with everything that you are doing and want to do everything we can to support you.'

He said there had been progress on human rights in the country, with the release of political prisoners and Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy winning seats in a by-election.

But he added: 'The most important message is that progress needs to be sustained and, in particular, we need to see the constitution amended.

'It would be completely wrong for elections to be held under a constitution that really excludes one person, who happens to be the leader of democracy in Burma, to be excluded from the highest office in the land.

Ms Suu Kyi also met William Hague, Justine Greening and Ed Miliband during her visit

'Those would be no elections at all, in 
my view. Those would not be democratic elections, the constitution has 
to be changed in that way and in other ways.

'We will do everything we can to build 
the international pressure to send the clearest possible message to the 
Burmese government that these changes must be made.'

Ms Suu Kyi said: 'The crucial issue at the moment is to make amendments to the constitution.

'If
the process of democratisation is to move forward, if it is to be 
sustainable, we have to amend the constitution to make it a democratic 
one, one that will ensure that the future of our society is going to be 
rooted in genuine democratic institutions.'

The Burmese opposition leader added: 'Although there has been some progress there has not yet been enough and in order to carry it forward we have to address this very important issue of constitutional change, of inclusive development which must have, at its heart, providing jobs for our young people and for others.'

Asked about progress on religious freedom and citizenship, Ms Suu Kyi said: 'It's for the president and his government to set a timeframe for their policies with regard to citizenship or any other matter that the government has to deal with.

'If you want me to give you a timeframe you had better make sure that I become president.'

Mr Cameron announced support for Ms Suu Kyi's plans for the renovation of the Rangoon General Hospital, with the UK funding a team to assess plans for the renovation of the 1,500-bed facility.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'Rangoon General Hospital has offered life-saving healthcare to the Burmese people for generations and it is right that we help Aung San Suu Kyi in her work to restore this crucial institution.

'Her project shows that Burma is getting back to business and I am pleased to support this and the country's wider agenda of healthcare reform.'

Ms Suu Kyi also met Labour leader Ed Miliband, who said she was an 'inspiration to politicians across the world'.
