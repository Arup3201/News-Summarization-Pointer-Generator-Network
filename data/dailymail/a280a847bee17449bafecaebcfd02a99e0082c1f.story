These stunning images may look like a scene from a sci-fi movie and you could be mistaken for thinking you're looking at an alien planet.

But these pictures actually show Iceland's river system taken from 3,000 feet in the air showing the view of the glacial landscape.

They were captured by French photographer Emmanuel Coupe-Kalomiris, 39, who has been on an expedition across the country.

His photos show the contours of the volcanic black sands as they meet the icy waters, making for a visual spectacle.

With tourism forming over 30 per cent of the island's income, visitors to the ice flows are treated to wonders such as the Jvkulsarlsn lagoon, dramatic ice walls and ominous icebergs.

Iceland is fast becoming the photography capital of the world - and with stunning results such as these, it's easy to see why.
