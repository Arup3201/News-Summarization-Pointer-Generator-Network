Kelly Davies, 31, was found dead at her home in Farnworth, Bolton on June 4 last year. The trial of her ex-boyfriend Joseph Davies is ongoing

A little girl was found clutching her doll and standing by the body of her mother, who had been stabbed to death, a court heard.

The body of Kelly Davies, 31, was found by a family friend at her home in Farnworth, Bolton, on June 4 last year.

Her ex-boyfriend Joseph Davies - no relation - is accused of stabbing her 22 times two days earlier - the day after he had been released from prison.

Davies, 36, of no fixed address, denies murder.

He was arrested in The Netherlands after being hit by a train in The Hague the day after Ms Davies' body was found. His injuries were so severe that he had to have his right leg amputated below the knee.

Family friend Vincent Walmsley told Manchester Crown Court that he discovered the body when he went to collect Ms Davies and her young daughter to take them to a party.

Mr Walmsley, 65, had acted as a carer to Ms Davies and had taken her to appointments for several years.

Mr Walmsley told the court how he let himself into the flat using his key just before 1pm on Monday June 4 last year.

There was no sign of a break-in, the patio doors were shut, but Ms Davies was lying 'prone' on the sofa.

Mr Walmsley told the court how he put his hand on Ms Davies' chest to see if she had a pulse but there was none and her face was white.

The television was on, but not tuned to a channel and her daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was standing by a wall.

'(The girl) was standing there clutching a little doll,' said Mr Walmsley, who rang the emergency services.

Mr Walmsley told the court how he had known Ms Davies since she was a teenager but for the last few years of her life had acted like a carer, taking her to appointments three or four times a week and helping her beat her heroin addiction.

The prosecution alleges that Joseph Davies stabbed his ex-girlfriend 22 times at her flat in Queen Street, Farnworth, Bolton, only a day after his release from prison

He said that in the months before her death she had been winning her battle and had been testing negative for drugs.

Davies,
the father of Ms Davies' three children and her former long-term 
boyfriend, was released from Haverigg prison in Cumbria on June 1 and 
had made arrangements to stay temporarily with Mr Walmsley.

The
pensioner told the court that on that morning he had taken Ms Davies to
the Stonehill Medical Centre, where she was seeking treatment for 
depression.

He received a 
call from Davies just after 1.30pm saying he had dropped bags of clothes
off at Mr Walmsley's house before going to the community drugs team 
centre to get a methadone prescription.

Mr
Walmsley said he collected Joseph Davies from the centre and took him 
to Ms Davies' flat in Queen Street, even though a judge had ruled the 
former couple should not be in contact.

He added the pair wanted to talk before deciding to visit friends in nearby Tonge Moor, so he gave them a lift in his van.

After receiving text messages from Ms Davies later that evening, asking him to pick them up again, he did so, taking them back to Ms Davies' flat.

Mr Walmsley said the pair had been drinking but were not in a bad mood until later on in the journey when Joseph Davies accused Ms Davies of seeing other men while he was in prison.

He added that during the conversation Ms Davies referred to a previous occasion when Davies had threatened to chop her up and throw her in the river.

She then swore on her children's lives that she had not been seeing anyone.

'I know now you're telling the truth because of the way you answered,' Davies is then said to have told Ms Davies.

On the morning of June 2 Davies turned up at Mr Walmsley's home, saying he wanted to go shopping in Bolton to buy some clothes for Ms Davies.

Mr Walmsley said Davies had a graze above one eye but did not explain how he got it.

The pensioner drove Davies into town and then went with Ms Davies to collect her daughter from a party and take them back to the Farnworth flat before he returned to Bolton to collect Davies.

Davies was carrying a polythene bag containing three dresses he had bought for Ms Davies and a mobile phone.

When the two men got back to Ms Davies' flat she came outside to collect the bag from the van and Mr Walmsley drove off.

He was never to hear from either of them again.

Two days later he went back to the flat to help Ms Davies take her daughter to another party, only to find the mother-of-three dead.

The court had previously heard that she had suffered multiple stab wounds to her throat, face and hands.

The prosecution allege this occurred on Saturday evening, shortly before Davies took a taxi to Manchester Airport and then on to London, where he caught a Eurostar train to Lille.

The trial continues.
