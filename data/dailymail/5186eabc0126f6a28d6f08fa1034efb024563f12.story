Joy Grigg, 50, from Tregeare near Launceston, Cornwall sleepwalked nine miles to local town Camelford, where she was found in a hedge

A mother-of-two who went missing after sleepwalking out of her kitchen window has been found - nine miles away.

Joy Grigg, 50, sparked a major police search after vanishing in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

Her husband Richard, 53, awoke to find his wife gone and the kitchen window wide open.

She was missing for nearly 24 hours until a member of the public found her in a hedge near Camelford, Cornwall, at 12.30am on Thursday.

Amazingly, it was the second time she has sleepwalked out of the family farm in Tregeare near Launceston, Cornwall, after wandering five miles away in January.

Mr Grigg, who lives on Lower Kyrse Farm with Joy and their two sons, Martin, 27, and Geoff, 25, said: ‘It is so great that she has been found.

‘She is currently in hospital, and we just want to get out lives back together and try and get things back to normal.

‘We are all very relieved and are very much looking forward to her coming home.

‘We were all very worried for her safety and as time went on obviously the worry grew, although that is all gone now that she has been found.

‘She is a very sensible person, a loving mother and wife and we are glad to have her back.’

Joy was found just as rescue workers were about to call off their search for the night.

A spokesman for North Dartmoor Search 
and Rescue team said: ‘We have been out in the Launceston area again 
today, helping with the continuing search for Joy Grigg.

‘As we were approaching the end of our searching for the day, Joy was located safe and well.’

Chief Inspector Shaun Kenneally of Devon and Cornwall Police said: ‘There was a great amount of support offered by volunteer agencies and the public in the search for Joy.

‘I'd like to particularly thank farmers in the area who took the time to search their land as part of the effort.

‘We're thankful the search was brought to a safe conclusion and that was in no small part due to the support of local people.’

Mr Grigg, Joy's husband of 28 years, said it is not the first time his wife had gone missing.

He said: ‘She has wandered off before, about six or seven weeks ago in January, that time she ended up around five miles away.

‘We managed to bring her back after I kept calling her mobile and eventually the vibration in her pocket woke her up.’
