Rapist: Barry Howell 'showed no remorse nor admitted his guilt' Manchester Crown Court heard

A father has been convicted of raping a woman 24 years ago after his son's DNA profile led police to him.

Barry Howell, 56, was jailed for nine years after a police cold case unit compared sample evidence from the attack and cross referenced it with the biological profiles of convicted offenders.

They found a familial link between the key DNA sample and a reading from that of Howell's son.

After that breakthrough officers tracked down the rapist and launched action against him which ended in a successful prosecution today at Manchester Crown Court.

Howell was arrested in February over the rape of his then 25-year-old victim in a derelict yard near Manchester Victoria rail station on November 22, 1989.

The woman was grabbed from behind as she left work between 6pm and 6.30pm and had a knife held to her throat.

Howell, of Denshaw Close, Burnage, told a jury at Manchester Crown Court that consensual sex took place and that it was the woman who had initiated it.

His account was rejected and he was found guilty of the rape.

Police said no arrests were made at the time of the attack but the inquiry was never closed as detectives pursued numerous forensic leads.

In 2004, Greater Manchester Police’s Cold Case Unit reviewed the case as part of Operation Advance, a nationwide review of unsolved rape cases using the latest DNA profiling techniques.

As a result, officers obtained a full DNA profile of the offender from the original forensic samples taken but despite this breakthrough there were no matches on the national DNA database and Howell remained at large.

Officers continued their search to expose this man and in 2012 they made the vital breakthrough.

DNA lists of convicted offenders were examined and a familial link was established with the full DNA profile obtained in 2004, said police.

This led officers to Howell who initially refused to provide a voluntary DNA sample when quizzed by police but finally gave one when police obtained a search warrant for his home.

His sample proved a direct match as further inquiries revealed he was living and working in Manchester at the time of the attack.

Detective Constable Michaela Clinch, who led the investigation, said: 'After 24 years of living with the terrible memory of being raped, I am absolutely delighted that finally this brave woman has seen her attacker exposed and brought to justice.

'She suffered a terrifying ordeal at the hands of Howell that evening 24 years ago. She was brutally raped at knifepoint and I know it is an experience that left her emotionally scarred and traumatised.

'But she has shown tremendous courage, patience and tenacity and today finally she can take some comfort knowing Howell has been convicted of this awful crime.

“This man hid for nearly a quarter of a century. When advances in DNA profiling led us to his door, he showed no remorse nor admitted his guilt, subjecting this woman to the further ordeal of giving evidence during a trial.

'But the DNA evidence itself was compelling and thankfully this rapist is now behind bars.

'Over the last 10 years in particular, advances in forensic technology have had a huge impact on the ability of the Cold Case Unit to investigate historic crimes.

'As a result of these developments, we are able to revisit historic crimes such as this rape and find new evidence that will help us pursue a conviction.

'Investigations into rapes are never closed because at the heart of those cases are men and women who deserve to see justice done, no matter how long it takes.

'All cases remain open in the hope that further information will come to light and that is where we are today.

'This woman has had to wait many years to see Howell exposed for the criminal he is and I hope she feels some sense of closure.

'I also hope it sends a message to other men and women who were raped or sexually attacked decades ago that Greater Manchester Police will never rest until your attacker is caught and as technology continues to develop, so too do our abilities to relentlessly pursue these criminals.'

In a statement issued by police, the woman said: 'What happened that evening has had an enormous and negative impact on not just my life but the lives of others, over the past 24 years.

Manchester Crown Court heard Mr Howell put his hand around her mouth before dragging her on to wasteland

'But I do not want to look back now, or pass any comment on Howell whatsoever. I want to move forward with my life and this process has brought me some sense of closure.

'What I would like to say is that if anyone else is in this situation, or has experienced what I have been through, I would encourage them to come forward and report it to the police.

'Times have changed and technology has developed so people do not have to suffer in silence or think that something that happened to them years ago can never be solved. It can.

'I also want to let people who have suffered a similar crime know that there is tremendous support now for victims.

'If you do come forward, you will receive a lot of support. I hope this story encourages others to speak up.'
