A pilot had a lucky escape when the replica First World War British fighter plane he was flying nose-dived into the ground after clipping a fence on landing during a public display.

The historic Sopwith Triplane fighter finished nose-down in the turf with its propeller ripped off by the force as rescue teams pulled the stricken pilot from the wreckage at the Shuttleworth Military Pageant.

Display pilot Roger ‘Dodge’ Bailey was coming in to land on the grass airstrip after a flying display at the Old Warden airfield near Biggleswade in Bedfordshire on Sunday afternoon at around 3.45pm.

Lucky escape: This is the moment a replica First World War British fighter plane nose-dived into the ground after clipping a fence on landing during a public display

But thankfully he emerged momentarily ‘stunned’ but otherwise unhurt for the ordeal after being eased gently from the upturned cockpit by rescue staff.

Witnesses described seeing the pilot trying to bring the Sopwith down quickly but said the afternoon’s unsettled weather and occasional gusting winds seem to have pushed the plane off course.

Eyewitness Hilton Holloway from London said: ‘The plane was just a few feet above the ground, when the undercarriage clipped a fence, causing it to nose dive straight into the ground, shattering the wooden propeller, tearing off the undercarriage and damaging the upper wing.'

As it approached the runway, some of the 
enthusiasts at the display said they suspected the pilot was also 
battling engine problems and that the Sopwith suffered a loss of power 
on its approach and a resulting loss of height.

The historic Sopwith Triplane fighter, a replica First World War 
British fighter plane nicknamed 'Dixie', got into trouble as it was just feet above the ground, among unsettled weather and gusty winds

Witnesses say the pilot was 
battling engine problems which led to a loss of power for the Sopwith 
and a loss of height. The plane then clipped the fence, 
causing the aircraft to career off course, and to nose-dive into the ground

Mr Holloway who was on hand with his camera said: ‘Luckily the Triplane did not roll over completely, because the engine embedded itself in the ground, reducing the risk to the pilot and greatly reducing the overall damage to the aircraft.

‘The crowd was stunned into silence. But thankfully the accident was not as serious as it might have been. The lack of smoke or fire was also reassuring.

‘The pilot seemed momentarily stunned. But the ground crew reached his shattered plane in  a matter of seconds and helped unstrap him and lift him out. The pilot did not receive immediate treatment and was seen talking to ground staff at few minutes later.

because the engine embedded itself in the ground, which reduced the risk
 to the pilot and the damage to the aircraft

The pilot was left unharmed
 and just momentarily 'stunned' after being eased gently from the 
upturned cockpit, pictured above. The crash shattered the wooden propeller, tore off the undercarriage and damaged the upper wing 

The airshow was suspended for just over an hour 
while permission was sought from the Air Accident Investigations Branch 
(AAIB) to move the aircraft

After the plane nose-dived, rescue workers began the work of getting the stricken crashed plane properly back on the ground

an hour while permission was sought from the Air Accident Investigations
 Branch (AAIB) to move the aircraft from its resting place. Bedfordshire
 police also arrive to take pictures of the incident.

Ground staff and emergency services managed to rapidly lift the Sopwith away from its resting place despite it being partly embedded in the ground.

Once the crushed undercarriage was extracted from under the plane, a large forklift truck was used to hoist the Triplane up by its propeller hub.

Sources at the Shuttleworth Collection say that the Sopwith, which is nicknamed ‘Dixie’ will be repair and returned to the skies, it is out of action for the rest of the flying season.

‘Dixie’ is an exact replica of the 1917 original and was built by the Northern Aeroplane Workshops in Harrogate for the Shuttleworth Collection. It is painted in the colours of the wartime Triplane N6290 which flew with the No 8 Squadron Royal Naval Air Service.

The plane first flew in 1992 and was awarded production Number ‘153’ by aeronautical pioneer and founder of the company, Sir Tom Sopwith who was so impressed by re-creation he declared it a ‘late production example’.
