A heartbroken couple are preparing to say their final goodbyes to their dying five-year-old son - three years after losing their daughter.

Kiran Nusrat and Irfan Akhtar, from Coventry, are living a nightmare that most parents couldn’t begin to imagine - knowing that shortly they will lose a second child to a cruel degenerative condition.

Abdullah is dying of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, the same condition that killed his sister, Adeeba, in 2010 when she was just three.

Kiran Nusrat and Irfan Akhtar had two children both with devastating mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. Their daughter, Adeeba, died in 2010 at the age of three and their son, Abdullah, five, is also dying

Ms Nusrat, 27, said: ‘I will never see them grow up like other parents see their children grow older and that really hurts.’

But she added: ‘I may not have had them for long but they are a blessing.’

Abdullah began to be gradually robbed of the ability to move before he could even crawl or say his first words.

He is unable to move anything other than his eyes and is currently being given palliative care at home.

His parents know that they will probably eventually have to make the traumatic decision to turn off his life support machine – just as they did with his sister.

Ms Nusrat said: ‘It’s hard seeing other parents with their children, going shopping and seeing children hold their mum’s hand and say “mummy”.

Adeeba appeared to be a healthy baby when she was first born but by the time she was six months old her parents had started to notice that she was becoming weak

Abdullah's parents are caring for him at home but they know he will probably have to go into a hospice

‘I’ve been a mum to two children and yet never heard them say “mum”.

‘I will never see them grow up like other parents see their children grow older and that hurts. It really hurts.’

The syndrome is an inherited disease which starts to show symptoms in infancy.

Most patients are born after a normal pregnancy and appear healthy at birth.

Symptoms usually begin to appear in the first few months of life.

It causes progressive muscle weakness, decreased muscle tone and kidney problems.

It also causes patients to lose motor skills such as standing, walking, eating and talking.

Eventually the muscles that control breathing become weak and respiratory failure is the most common cause of death.

Intelligence is not usually affected.

Children with severe forms of the condition usually survive for less than a year.

It is not yet fully understood what causes the condition but both parents of the child have to carry the gene mutation.

It is recessive meaning a child has a 25 per cent chance of suffering from the disease if both their parents carry the mutation.

There were no signs of problems when 
Adeeba was born in 2006, but when she was six months old her parents 
noticed she was getting weaker.

Their world came crashing down when she was rushed to hospital gasping for breath one night having suddenly deteriorated.

Adeeba struggled to get enough oxygen and she was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary where she was ventilated.

She had a tracheotomy, and spent 10 months on the high dependency ward where she was finally diagnosed with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome.

The condition results in neurological symptoms that start to appear in infancy and is characterised by generalised muscle weakness.

As the disorder worsens, the muscles which control breathing are weakened and ventilator support is needed.

Ms Nusrat soon discovered she was pregnant with their second child and Adeeba was in intensive care by the time her little brother was born.

The couple prayed Abdullah would escape the rare genetic disorder - and were told there was a 75 per cent chance he would.

But their world was shattered for a second time when he too suffered developmental delays and was finally diagnosed with the same condition at seven months old.

‘We weren’t only unlucky once, but twice,’ Ms Nusrat said.

Ms Nusrat, 27, said: 'I will never see them grow up like other parents see their children grow older and that really hurts'

Just after his first birthday, Abdullah was also admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary and he and his sister were in cubicles next to each other some of the time.

But after a bad bout of the respiratory infection bronchiolitis, Adeeba was taken to Rainbows Hospice for Children and Young People in Loughborough where she passed away in July 2010.

Her parents found Rainbows to be a ‘magical’ place, nothing like what they expected it to be.

They were so impressed by the care Adeeba received they vowed it would be where they switched off Abdullah’s life support machine when the time came.

The couple are raising money for the children’s hospice where Abdullah will probably spend his last hours.

The condition causes muscle weakness which becomes so severe patients are unable to breathe unaided
