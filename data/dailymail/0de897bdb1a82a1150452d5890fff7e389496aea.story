Defeated: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he would never accept a peerage in an unreformed House of Lords

Nick Clegg said he will never sit in the House of Lords as he was mocked by other MPs over a reform cave-in.

The Deputy Prime Minister told political opponents he would never accept a peerage in an unreformed House of Lords, in a humiliating cave-in.

His admission came as he told the Commons about the Government's withdrawal of its Lords reform plans, which was met with mocking jeers from Labour members.

He was asked by Dennis Skinner if, for all his talk of 
wanting democracy in the Upper House, he would accept the title ‘Lord 
Clegg’ - a question he has dodged when previously asked.

However, this time he replied: 'No, I will not. I don’t think I’d be very welcome, 
in the first place. I personally will not take up a place in an 
unreformed House of Lords.’

While Mr Clegg's admission was mocked by Labour members, the current system favours the party considerably.

The reform cave-in allows Labour to keep an Upper House filled with former comrades.

Plans to make constituency boundaries fairer have also been dumped, meaning the number of MPs will not be reduced.

Nick Clegg said that he hoped his plans to reform the House of Lords could be revived in the next parliament as he formally confirmed the proposals had been abandoned by the current Government.

The Deputy Prime Minister has led calls for a mainly-elected second chamber, but was forced to concede defeat last month when faced with entrenched opposition from Tory MPs and Labour's refusal to back a crucial timetable for the House of Lords Reform Bill.

Little progress: Mr Clegg confirmed the Bill had been withdrawn but said he hoped the process had 'inched us forward' towards his goal of a reformed Lords

As MPs returned to Westminster 
following the summer recess, Mr Clegg confirmed the Bill had been 
withdrawn but said he hoped the process had 'inched us forward' towards 
his goal of a reformed Lords - a flagship Liberal Democrat policy.

Speaking
in the House of Commons, he allowed himself a rueful smile as he told 
MPs: 'I would like to make a statement on House of Lords reform... or 
what’s left of it.'

The formal announcement that the Bill
had been killed off was greeted with cheers by Tory backbenchers sat 
behind the Deputy Prime Minister.

'I
can confirm that the Government has today withdrawn that Bill, about 
which I am not as happy as members behind me are,' Mr Clegg said.

He continued: 'Regrettably the coalition will not be able to deliver Lords reform during this Parliament.'

But Mr Clegg said that the 'hard work' of MPs and peers on the proposals had 'inched us forward'.

Status quo: Legislation to reform the House of Lords received a second reading earlier this year, but Mr Clegg was forced to admit defeat for his proposals last month

The legislation was given a second reading by MPs earlier this year, as Labour backed the principle of the reforms.

But
the Bill's progress was halted as Labour sided with Tory rebels in 
refusing to back a timetable necessary to prevent it being talked out.

Prime
Minister David Cameron failed to reach an agreement with his backbench 
rebels over the reforms and Mr Clegg was forced to concede defeat.

Mr
Clegg condemned Labour’s actions, but told the Commons: 'My hope is 
that we will return to this in the next parliament, emboldened by the 
historic second reading vote.

'For
now, the immediate decision for the Government is how we fill the gap 
in the legislative timetable and we will bring forward measures to 
promote growth.'

Deputy 
Labour leader Harriet Harman said she shared Mr Clegg’s 'disappointment 
at the lack of progress' in reforming the upper chamber.

'It can’t be right that in the 21st century we have an unelected chamber making decisions on the law of the land,' she added.

Pressure point: David Cameron leaves 10 Downing Street today. Cracks in his coalition Government have widened after Tory rebels failed to support proposals for reform of the House of Lords

The fallout from Mr Clegg's humiliating defeat has widened cracks in the coalition Government.

When
the Deputy Prime Minister announced the end of the proposals last 
month, he claimed that the Tories had broken the coalition 'contract'.

He
revealed that, in retaliation, Liberal Democrat MPs could no longer 
support changes to constituency boundaries for the 2015 general 
election.

David Cameron denied the contract had
been broken, and said he intends to press ahead with the boundary 
changes, which would reduce the size of the House of Commons from 650 to
600 seats.

Sympathy: Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman said she shared Mr Clegg's 'disappointment at the lack of progress' in reforming the upper chamber

It is thought the changes could 
deliver as many as 20 extra seats to the Tories, by equalising the size 
of constituencies across the UK.

Ms Harman asked Mr Clegg whether the process of boundary changes would now be stopped in its tracks as a result of Lib Dem opposition.

'Isn’t it pointless and costly to allow the Boundary Commission to carry on with its work for a further 14 months?'

She asked for an early opportunity for MPs to vote on the issue, promising Labour support for Mr Clegg.

Ms Harman asked: 'Will you turn your words of August 6 into action? The ball is in your court, will you assure the House that at least we have a Deputy Prime Minister who is a man not a mouse.'

But Mr Clegg attacked Labour, who he blamed for the Lords legislation’s failure, giving Ms Harman '10 out of 10 for spectacular insincerity'.

'The Labour Party used to campaign against privilege and patronage,' he said. 'The Labour Party used to say it was the party of the people.

'The Labour Party used to believe that the second chamber should be abolished altogether.

'And yet when push comes to shove what did they do?'

The Deputy Prime Minister continued: 'They voted for the idea of reform but not for the means to deliver it.

'They delivered lofty speeches about the need to give the people a say about how to elect the legislators in the other place, but they wouldn’t even tell us how many days they wanted for the timetable motion to make that lofty rhetoric a reality.

'I think the history books will judge the Labour Party very, very unkindly indeed.'

Mr Clegg said that, faced with the opportunity to build on the work of former ministers Robin Cook and Jack Straw and be the 'friends of reform', Labour instead 'turned into miserable little party point-scoring politicians instead'.
