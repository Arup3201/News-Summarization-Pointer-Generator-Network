Heartbreaking: This is one of the last photos showing Justine Davis together with her 3-year-old son, Cameron, at a Cuban turtle preserve just hours before he was struck and killed by a truck

A Canadian mother who has been detained in Cuba since Christmas in connection to a scooter crash that killed her 3-year-old son learned today that she will be allowed to return home in time for his funeral.

Justine Davis, a General Motors worker from Toronto, went on a last-minute vacation with little Cameron on the small island of Cayo Largo del Sur during the winter holidays.

On December 23, three days into their trip, the mother and son rented a Jeep and then a gas-powered scooter to explore the island around the Playa Blanca resort where they were staying.

About 5 minutes after leaving the hotel area, Davis' scooter was struck by a large truck on a partially paved road.

Miss Davis was airlifted to a hospital in Havana to be treated for serious injuries, including a broken arm and fractured leg, which required five surgeries.

It was not until a day later that the woman learned from a Canadian embassy official that her only son, a sweet, curly-haired toddler, was killed the collision.

While the Toronto resident has not been charged with any crime, Cuban police ordered her to remain in the country for six weeks as they continued to investigate the crash.

Under Cuban law, traffic accidents are treated as crimes, and the victims are considered prime suspects until they are proven innocent.

Trip gone awry: The mother and son rented a scooter, and five minutes later they were hit by a truck, which killed the 3-year-old on the spot and left Justine with broken bones 

Three-year-old Cameron's body was released from custody in mid-January and flown back to Canada in preparation for his funeral.

Miss Davis had spent the past month-and-a-half convalescing in a foreign country against her will, and wondering if she would make it back home to attend the toddler's funeral and deliver a eulogy, which she had already written, Toronto Sun reported.

Justine Davis' plight has been extensively covered by Canadian news media, while the woman’s friends and family took to social media sites to drum up support for her cause and pressure the Cuban government to let her go.

A Facebook page called 'Bring Justine Davis Home for Cameron's Funeral February 8, 2014' has drawn more than 6,500 'likes,' and the mother's supporters also have been spreading the word about her tragic ordeal through the Cameron Davis Foundation.

In order to give Justine Davis time to heal from her injuries and return home, Cameron’s memorial service was delayed as long as possible, but because of Cuba’s sub-par embalming techniques, the child must be laid to rest no later than Saturday.

“This has been a total nightmare … it’s going to crush me,’ Davis told CTVNews.ca Wednesday in a phone interview. ‘I just can’t imagine not being allowed to go. I’m his mother.’

When news came down Thursday that Justine will be allowed to go home after all, her close friend Amber Hussey said the mother was both 'excited' and 'completely overwhelmed.'

Hussey revealed to the news station that her friend lost her father to brain cancer just a moth before the fatal scooter crash that killed her son.

This morning, officials at the Cuban Embassy in Ottawa and Canada’s Minister of State Lynne Yelich confirmed that Davis would be coming home, according to Toronto Star.

‘Pleased to relay that Ms. Davis is free to leave Cuba. We appreciate Cuba’s efforts to resolve this situation,’ Yelich tweeted.

Deborah Ojeda Valedon, deputy chief of mission at the Cuban embassy in Ottawa, said Davis would arrive in Canada on Friday.

Cameron’s funeral will take place Saturday morning at St. Chad’s Anglican Church in Toronto.
