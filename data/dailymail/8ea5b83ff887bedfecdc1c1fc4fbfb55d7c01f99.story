Mistake: Toby Donachie, 19, was supposed to be 
flying to Biarritz with Ryanair, but ended up boarding a flight with the
same airline to Malmo, Sweden

A professional surfer who thought he was flying to the south of France to go training was shocked when he discovered he had touched down in Sweden.

Toby Donachie, 19, was supposed to be flying to Biarritz with Ryanair, but ended up boarding a flight with the same airline to Malmo, in southern Sweden.

The mistake came after a last-minute gate change and Mr Donachie only realised he was in the wrong aircraft when he heard an in-flight announcement.

The teenager, from Padstow, Cornwall, said his tickets were checked twice before he got on board, once by the staff at the gate and again on the plane.

He said: 'Half-way there, there was a call saying we’re flying over Denmark.

'The tickets were looked at. My boarding pass said Biarritz, and yet I was on a plane to Malmo, Sweden.

'The cabin crew just felt really bad for me when I told them. They were worried about me and super helpful.'

Mr Donachie added: 'The cabin crew told me that when they did the head count, a child was hiding on the plane; so the crew didn’t notice that there was an extra passenger.'

Once he arrived in Sweden, he was put on another flight back to the UK.

The airline paid for a hotel and gave him a new ticket to Biarritz the following day.

'All my family and friends cried with laughter when I told them I had arrived in the wrong country,' he added.

Questions: A Ryanair plane pictured at Stansted airport. Staff checked Mr Donachie's tickets twice but no one picked up on the error which has raised questions over how secure Ryanair's boarding procedures are

But he said the incident raised questions over how secure Ryanair’s boarding procedures were.

Stansted Airport said the responsibility for checking passengers at the gate and on to planes lay with airlines.

Ryanair
said: 'While the primary responsibility for boarding the correct 
aircraft lies with each passenger, we have asked our handling agent in 
Stansted to investigate this error and ensure that whatever procedural 
breakdown happened in this case will not recur.'

Mr Donachie began to be noticed for his talent in 2006 and that year came 4th place in the European Championships.
