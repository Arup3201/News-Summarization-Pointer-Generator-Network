A range of dinosaur t-shirts aimed only at boys has landed both Marks and Spencer and the Natural History Museum at the centre of a sexism row.

The store has been accused of 'gender stereotyping' and sending a 'perplexing message' to girls with the clothing line, produced in partnership with the London Museum.

 'It is a real shame that children are being told implicitly what is for them and what is not,' said Ruth Lopardo, co-founder of Let Clothes Be Clothes. 

Marks and Spencer has found itself at the centre of a sexism row over its range of dinosaur clothing, produced in partnership with the Natural History Museum, aimed only at boys

'All kids like dinosaurs. I am sure we can all remember the excitement of going to the Natural History Museum and seeing those great big skeletons and I don't think that is gender dependent.

'If Marks and Spencer is doing a range with the Natural History Museum, I cannot understand why they are limiting their market by half.  

'It is perplexing message to send to girls at a time when the government are worried about the lack of women going into science and technology professions.' 

The campaign group has called for the range, which includes pyjamas, t-shirts and underwear,  to be extended to include items for girls.

Campaigners say the range is sending a 'perplexing message' to girls

It is currently priced between  £8 and £18 and aimed at boys four to 14 years.

They claim a Marks and Spencer customer service representative told them: 'As a Science enthusiast myself, I'm also a little unhappy to see that the range only caters for boys. Please be aware therefore that I have passed your comments onto our Kidswear Team.'

Harriet Vickers who is a Second Year General Engineering degree student at Durham University and also on the WISE Young Women's Board said: 'I think the key point to pick out from this debate is choice. 

'Providing children the opportunity to choose clothing that appeals to them because they are genuinely interested in the subject matter it depicts and not because they feel they feel inclined to choose it as it in the 'Girls' or 'Boys' section of a store. 

'I don't feel it's a case of girls' clothing aiming to be similar to a boys range, but providing range which maximises option for both girls and boys. And parents are key to ensuring children feel confident to wear what they want especially when it comes to things that are seen as breaking stereo-types.'

A spokesman for Marks and Spencer said that their design team was working with the National History Museum to expand the range to include products for girls.

An M&S spokesperson said: 'This is a brand new partnership and, as with any new range, we have listened carefully to feedback from our customers on how they would like to see it evolve. 

'Our design team is currently working with the Natural History Museum on expanding the range to include products for girls.'

The Evening Standard reported that the National History Museum said that they would do their 'best to ensure the range is accessible to all children.'
