Revenge: A Colombian wife has been accused of pouring boiling water on her husband's genitals

A Colombian wife has been accused of pouring boiling water onto her husband's genitals as he slept after finding out he had been unfaithful.

Yolivel Lopez  allegedly tipped the liquid on top of Nefer Netan's private parts after receiving a call from his mistress saying they had just had sex.

El Meridiano reports that Netan arrived at his home in the early hours of Tuesday morning after saying he had been out for a few drinks with friends.

Lopez allowed him to fall sleep, 
before going to the kitchen where she filled a pot with water and placed
it on the stove to heat up.

Once boiled, she carried the pot into the bedroom and tipped it on to her husband's genitals.

Neighbours
in the town of Martinez, near Cerete in north-east Colombia, said 
Netan's screams 'pierced the night sky' and he was taken to hospital for
treatment.

But, reports El Meridiano, doctors said his genitals was 'utterly destroyed' in the incident.

Locals say Lopez has not been seen since the alleged attack.

This is not the first example of women taking extreme revenge.

Last year a woman flew into a jealous rage and chopped off her partner’s penis before flushing it down the toilet after discovering that he was cheating.

Huaman Julia Muñoz, 41, allegedly decided to inflict a grisly act of revenge on her partner, Ramon Arias Apayco’s, 46, while he slept.

Munoz allegedly sliced off her boyfriend's penis with a kitchen knife as he slept at a hostel in Brena, Peru, The New Age website reported.

The scorned woman attempted to flee after her violent act but was caught by horrified hostel staff who alerted the police.

When police quizzed her about the attack, she confessed that she had discovered that her partner had been unfaithful and she reacted in fury.

A woman in southern Bangladesh cut off a man's penis during an alleged attempt to rape her and took it to a police station as evidence, the BBC reported.

The incident took place in Mirzapur village, Jhalakathi, about 200km (124 miles) south of the capital, Dhaka in May 2011.

Married Monju Begum, 40, a mother-of-three, told police that her neighbour Mozammel Haq Mazi forced his way into her home and started assaulting her.

Mr Mazi, who denies the accusation, was admitted to a nearby hospital.

In July 2011, Catherine Kieu Becker, of California, was arrested after she drugged her estranged husband.

She tied him to a bed, cut off his penis with a large knife and threw it down a garbage disposal.

The 48-year-old pleaded not guilty to all the charges against her and is currently jailed on $1 million bail.

A 28-year-old woman was accused of cutting off a man's penis before slitting his throat and stabbing him to death in a motel room in May.

Cristal Paulette Richardson, from Dallas, was charged with the grisly murder of Cedric Lamont Owens, 34.

He was found dead in a room 'multiple stab wounds to his upper body, his throat was cut and there was traumatic amputation of the penis and scrotum' at a Motel 6 in the Fair Park area of Dallas, according to medical reports.

Richardson was taken to hospital to be treated for minor wounds on her hands before being arrested and charged with murder
