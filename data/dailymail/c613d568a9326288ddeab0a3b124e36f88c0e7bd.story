From pink mini Converse to stylish baby bomber jackets, children have long been outdoing their parents in the style stakes.

And now children can take their trend one-upmanship one step further with the launch of a range of adorable ankle bracelets already adorning the limbs of the mini A-list.

The Saturdays' Una Healy was one of the first to put a set of Saffron Bells on daughter Aoife Belle, with Michelle Heaton's baby Faith and Amanda Holden's baby Hollie, both joining in with the trend too.

The idea behind Saffron Bells came when magazine journalist Charlotte Fall had a pair of anklets handmade for her baby girl Saffron.

She was stunned by the number of people who would stop her in the street to find out where the baby bells were from.

Not only was she impressed by the stir they caused, but she says she also loved knowing where her baby daughter was at all times, thanks to the light tinkling sound the bells made as Saffron crawled about.

Not long afterwards, the idea for Saffron Bells was born. Fast forward to today and Saffron Bells has expanded from a twinkle in Charlotte's eye to the UK’s first baby anklet jewellery label.

Celebrity fans are coming in 
thick and fast with Amanda Holden describing them as 'very sweet' and 
Michelle Heaton dubbing them 'so cute'.

Handmade with solid silver, Saffron Bells expandable anklet pairs are suitable from birth and are designed to grow with the child. They cost £85 for a single and £140 for a pair.

Each bangle has two bells, with the pair having four - representing love, health, success and gratitude - that jingle with every move.

They can be worn into toddlerhood, after which they convert into wrist bracelets and can be worn for many more years.

Although the company only launched at
the end of last year, they have already landed a coveted award after being 
handed gold in the Mumpreneur UK Website Awards 2013.

First of their kind: The bells were the brainchild of Charlotte Fall and are priced at £85 each

Famous young fans: Hollie Holden and Faith Heaton also have a pair of the Saffron Bells and both celebrity mothers Amanda and Michelle have spoken out about how much they love the designs

They are suitable from 0–2 years old, after which they convert to wrist bracelets 

Although Saffron Bells are a new concept for the UK, they are inspired by the traditions of Thailand – where anklets with bells are given to babies (both male and female) to ward off bad spirits

Weighing 23g (traditional baby bangles weigh only 4g) 925 sterling silver Saffron Bells are substantial, they are 100% safe and they expand as your child grows. Many people say five months of age is the golden time to start wearing SBs, as this is when baby ankles seem big (and chubby) enough to keep the anklets on
