Holidays with your spouse are supposed to be relaxing.

Unfortunately, these trips are all-too-often soured by arguments, especially during potentially dire long haul flights.

New research suggests most Australians agree there is an easy step you can take to alleviate this problem: booking a stopover.

A new study from  the Singapore Tourism Board found that stopovers can be a valuable way for couples to avoid conflict

The study from the Singapore Tourism Board found that almost three million Australians have experienced a negative impact on their relationship after travelling on a flight for over 10 hours.

Nearly half of all Australians featured in the study said the stopover would alleviate this effect.

Dr Melissa Keogh, one of Australia's leading psychologists, told Daily Mail Australia 'having something to look forward to at the tail end of a holiday can be very helpful psychologically.'

'It breaks things up and allows you to keep a positive outlook. A trip after a long flight can be tainted by a long flight.'

'A stopover is one way for couples to break up their journey back home and thereby reduce the impact of conflict on their relationship. 

'By doing so the holiday, which should be a happy and positive time, can remain just that as opposed to being overshadowed by other issues,' she said.

Jay Edmondson, 32, and Louise Heesom-Smith, 30, are an Australian couple who travel together several times a year, and say 'the pros of stopping over definitely outweigh the cons'

 1. Try to keep the positive to negative ratio of comments at five to one.

2. If you're agitated, try to cool down before you says something confrontational.

3. Communicate clearly what you both want  out of the trip before hand.

4. If possible, spend some time apart during the trip where you do your own thing.

5. Stay well rested before and during the holiday.

6.  Plan the trip thoroughly. This will reduce stress and allow you more leisure time.

'Since planes are a confined space, there's nowhere to escape if you grow irritated.'

Dr Keogh says our brains don't function as well on flights, which can give rise to anxiety and frustration.

'A stopover gives you something to look forward too, which keeps you optimistic. 

'A good holiday is very underestimated for your psychological well-being. I've had patients with severe depression go on a great holiday, and they no longer require medication afterwards.'

Jay Edmondson, 32, and Louise Heesom-Smith, 30,  are an Australian couple who travel together several times a year, and are adamant that stopovers are a wise idea.

'The pros of stopping over definitely outweigh the cons,' says Mr Edmondson.

'Don't get me wrong, after our recent visit to London we were both ready to get home and unpack out suitcases, however had we not stopped over I don't think we would have looked back at our holiday with such positive memories.' 

'We were both tired and irritable having been so busy in London that having a stopover meant we could relax and enjoy each others company before getting back into our daily routine.'

'Having that mini-break enabled us to continue our holiday for longer.'
