Two in three gout sufferers are not receiving treatment to cure their condition, say researchers.

They found that GPs are issuing prescriptions to just a third of the patients who could benefit.

But the research shows nearly half of gout sufferers qualify for treatment at their first consultation.

One in every 40 people in the UK has been diagnosed with the painful disorder that famously afflicted Henry VIII.

It used to be rare among the young, but research suggests it is becoming more common – with the obese getting it a decade earlier than those of a healthy weight. 

Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis that causes acute pain, redness and swelling in peripheral joints, most commonly in the big toe.

The condition is caused by deposits of monosodium urate crystals, which are related to high levels of uric acid in the blood, and can be alleviated using urate-lowering treatment (ULT).

Researchers at Nottingham University investigated when patients on a large UK primary care database became eligible for ULT, and how many of them ended up being prescribed it. 

Of 52,164 patients with gout, the average time to the first treatment for complications such as multiple attacks and chronic kidney disease was five months. 

At the first consultation the likelihood of them being eligible for ULT was 44 per cent, with a 61 per cent likelihood after one year.

After five years, the chances of gout patients being eligible for treatment rose to 87 per cent, then to 94 per cent at ten years following diagnosis.

However, the average prescription rate for ULT among the practices studied was 32.5 per cent, says a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Research leader Dr Chang-Fu Kuo said: ‘Our study aimed to estimate the proportion of patients fulfilling eligibility criteria for urate-lowering treatment since the diagnosis of the disease.

‘The majority of patients are eligible at or shortly following diagnosis. 

'However, only one third of eligible patients received such potentially curative treatment. 

'This suboptimal treatment occurs for many reasons, including insufficient knowledge of the disease and its management, and misconceptions concerning its causes and its impact on patients’ quality of life and wellbeing.

‘Our recommendation is to give full information to patients early in their clinical course at the time that they are first being informed about gout, its causes and the treatments that are available.’
