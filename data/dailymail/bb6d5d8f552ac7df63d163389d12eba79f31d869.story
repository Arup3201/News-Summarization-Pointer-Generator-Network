Southern California animal control officers are hunting for a venomous cobra that bit a dog and then slithered off into the suburban neighborhood of Thousand Oaks.

Los Angeles County spokeswoman Lara Arsinian says the dog was bitten by the snake Wednesday in a residential area of Thousand Oaks.

The dog's owner managed to take a photo of the snake, which animal control officers identified as an albino monocled cobra.

The dog was taken to an animal hospital in critical condition.

Arsinian says albino monocled cobras are illegal to own.

The snakes are common in southeast Asia and can grow to more than 4 feet long.

Antivenom has been located at the San Diego Zoo, according to the LA Times.

The owner of the snake has not been found.

Thousand Oaks is in area of Ventura County serviced by Los Angeles County animal control.
