Jailed: Kimberley Doherty was living with her three children, who were aged four months, six years and seven, when she sparked a fire

A mother has been jailed after setting fire to her home while her three children slept upstairs in a bid to get rehoused.

After igniting the rug in the hallway, Kimberley Doherty, shouted for help and smothered the flames herself with a damp towel.

Bolton Crown Court was told that in January Doherty was living with her three children, who were aged four months, six years and seven.

Her friend and neighbour, Gemma Giles,
told police how she had become withdrawn and discussed suicide in the 
weeks leading up to the arson.

Then, on January 8 at 10.30pm, Ms Giles was in bed when she heard shouts and screams coming from her neighbour's home.

She ran across the road and saw Doherty lying in the hall with a towel over her. The next day the police were called.

Doherty told them she had received 
threatening messages from a former partner and a piece of lit cardboard 
had been posted through her letter box.

She later admitted she had been lying.

Doherty, 28, wept in the dock as the 
Honorary Recorder of Bolton, Judge Timothy Clayson, sentenced her to two
and a half years in jail.

She had pleaded guilty to arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered following the incident in Westhoughton, Lancashire.

'She set the fire in order to hope that it would assist in the removal of herself and her family to a different address,' said Duncan McDiarmid, defending.

He added that Doherty, who was of previous good character, had been suffering from anxiety and claimed she had been assaulted.

The court heard that medical experts were unable to agree whether Doherty had a mental health disorder.

Jailing her, Judge Clayson said he accepted she had not intended to hurt her children, who were vulnerable and asleep at the time of the fire.

'But equally, you put those children at very great risk,' he added.

'In the minutes when this fire was alight it could so easily have got out of control with tragic consequences.'
