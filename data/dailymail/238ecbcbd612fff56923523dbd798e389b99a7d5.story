While some chefs these days can be full of hot air, top chef Angelique Schmeinck cooks with it hundreds of feet from the ground on her unique hot air balloon restaurant.

Dutch cook Schmeinck can host up to 14 diners as they take flight and experience not just stunning views of Holland but culinary delights prepared in the sky.

The customised balloon has everything a chef could need and more to serve up a variety of tasty morsels, with Schmeinck even using its flame to prepare elements of dishes including Scottish lobster, coquilles Saint Jacques (scallops with wine and mushrooms), wild sea bass and guinea-fowl.

It likely comes as no surprise that CuliAir Sky Dining doesn't come cheap with a somewhat inflated price of  £360-a-head, a cool £140 more than the tasting menu at Heston Blumenthal's The Fat Duck.

For their outlay though diners, who spend at least 75 minutes in the air, get an aperitif and nibbles before take-off, three courses and cooking demonstration, matching wines and a copy of the chef's book, Swingen in de Keuken.
