Britain joining military action against ISIL increases the risk of a terror attack on European soil, will be at greater risk of a terror attack, the EU's anti-terrorism chief has warned.

Gilles de Kerchove claimed more than 3,000 Europeans have so far joined extremists fighting in Iraq and Syria.

He said countries, including the UK, joining the international coalition against murderous ISIS militants must 'take some measures to protect their citizens' from the threat posed by returning fighters.

MPs are expected to vote in favour of Britain taking part in air strikes against ISIS bases in Iraq.

Prime Minister David Cameron warned Britain cannot 'walk on by' in the face of the threat posed by 'psychopathic terrorists'.

But Mr de Kerchove said the move raises the risk of retaliation from ISIS on European soil, and could even spur Al-Qaeda to launch an attack to show that it is 'still relevant'.

He told the BBC that there had been 'steady growth' in the number of Europeans joining ISIS fighters, hitting an 'unprecedented' 3,000 in recent weeks.

Asked if European countries joining military action raises the prospect of a terror attack on European soil, Mr Kerchove replied: 'I think we have to acknowledge that it will.

'That was clear with the French because three days ago ISIL issued a statement saying there would be retaliation against the coalition.

'A French man was kidnapped in Algeria and he has been beheaded. So in a way sadly they did what they announced.'

'So I think countries being part of this coalition will have to take some measures to protect their citizens and assess the risk.

'But this is not only the ISIL, you have Al-Qaeda, through its affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, and maybe the rise of ISIL may prompt Al-Qaeda to show that it is still relevant.'

Prime Minister David Cameron warns ISIS has behaved with 'staggering brutality' as he opens the debate ahead of the vote in Parliament

'That this House condemns the barbaric acts of ISIL against the peoples of Iraq including the Sunni, Shia, Kurds, Christians and Yazidi and the humanitarian crisis this is causing; 

'Recognises the clear threat ISIL poses to the territorial integrity of Iraq and the request from the Government of Iraq for military support from the international community and the specific request to the UK Government for such support; 

'Further recognises the threat ISIL poses to wider international security and the UK directly through its sponsorship of terrorist attacks and its murder of a British hostage; 

'Acknowledges the broad coalition contributing to military support of the Government of Iraq including countries throughout the Middle East; 

'Further acknowledges the request of the Government of Iraq for international support to defend itself against the threat ISIL poses to Iraq and its citizens and the clear legal basis that this provides for action in Iraq; 

'Notes that this motion does not endorse UK air strikes in Syria as part of this campaign and any proposal to do so would be subject to a separate vote in Parliament; 

'Accordingly supports Her Majesty's Government, working with allies, in supporting the Government of Iraq in protecting civilians and restoring its territorial integrity, including the use of UK air strikes to support Iraqi, including Kurdish, security forces' efforts against ISIL in Iraq; 

'Notes that Her Majesty's Government will not deploy UK troops in ground combat operations; 

'And offers its wholehearted support to the men and women of Her Majesty's armed forces.'

The CIA has suggested there might be as many as 31,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.

Mr de Kerchove addedd: 'It is a steady growth. Probably the declaration of the establishment of the caliphate may have played a role.'

Britain's decision to join military strikes follows the involvement of the US, France and several Arab nations.

MPs have been recalled to Westminster today to vote on British involvement in air strikes against ISIS - also known as Islamic State or ISIL - in Iraq, at the request of the Iraqi government.

Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'Of course, some will say that any action you take will further radicalise young people.

"I have to say this is a counsel of despair. The threat of radicalisation is already here. Young people have left our country to go and fight with these extremists.

"We must take action at home, but we must also have a comprehensive strategy to defeat these extremists abroad."

In the debate, former Defence Secretary Liam Fox added: 'You cannot join a Jihadi gap year and come back to the UK with impunity.'

Six RAF Tornados have been stationed in Cyprus for the past six weeks and have been flying surveillance flights over northern Iraq.

They could begin dropping bombs and missiles within hours of the Prime Minister giving orders after the Commons vote at 5pm.

Opening the debate, Mr Cameron said: 'There is no more serious issue than asking our armed forces to put themselves in harm's way to protect our country.'

He insisted British involvement in military action in Iraq was necessary and in the national interest, working with local partner countries to build an international coalition.

He admitted the 2003 invasion of Iraq by Tony Blair's government 'hangs heavy' over the Commons, but warned today's situation is 'very different'.

'This is not 2003, we must not use past mistakes as an excuse for indifference or inaction,' the PM added.

He said the UK has a 'duty' to act and could not leave responsibility for keeping the British people safe to other countries.

'Is there a threat to the British people? The answer is yes,' he said. 'ISIL has already murdered one British hostage and has threatened to murder two more.'

Mr Cameron added: 'ISIL is a terrorist organisation unlike those we have dealt with before.

'The brutality is staggering - beheadings, crucifixions, gauging out of eyes, use of rape as a weapon. All those things belong to the dark ages.'
