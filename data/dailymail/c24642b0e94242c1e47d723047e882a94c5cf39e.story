A former Massachusetts prosecutor says actor Mark Wahlberg should not be pardoned for a 1988 assault of two Vietnamese men because he has never acknowledged the crime was racist.

Wahlberg filed an appeal with the Massachusetts Parole Board in December asking them to pardon him of a 1988 conviction for assault which saw him jailed for three months. 

The Oscar-tipped performer claims he is a different person from the man that committed the attack 26 years ago, and has tried to make up for his actions in later life. 

However Judith Beals, a former state prosecutor who led a case against Wahlberg for hurling stones and racial slurs at black children two years earlier, says the appeal should be turned down.

Forgiveness: Actor Mark Wahlberg has asked the Massachusetts Parole Board to pardon him for a 1988 conviction for assault after he hit two Vietnamese men and tried to rob an alcohol store

Ms Beals said today that she believes in 'forgiveness and reconciliation', but that Wahlberg has yet to acknowledge the racial element of his crimes, which she says should be the key to a pardon.

The case against Wahlberg began in 1986, when he and two white friends were caught chasing three black siblings in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, throwing rocks and yelling racial slurs.

The following day, Wahlberg and a larger group of white friends harassed a group of mostly black fourth-graders until an ambulance driver intervened.

Ms Beals helped to prosecute the case against Wahlberg, then aged 14, and he was issued with an order which would allow for a criminal conviction in the event he committed another racially motivated offence.

Two years later, in 1988, Wahlberg was back in court again, this time charged with hitting a Vietnamese man in the head with a stick while trying to steal alcohol from a convenience store.

Court papers filed at the time say Wahlberg hit one man, named Thanh Lam, over the head with a five-foot wooden pole while yelling 'Vietnam f****** s***'.

Denied: Judith Beals, who lead a case against Wahlberg for hurling stone and racial slurs at black children in 1986, says the appeal should be denied because he has never accepted his crimes were racist

Wahlberg went on the run from the crime scene, and before he was caught by police he punched another Vietnamese man, named Johnny Trinh, in the face.

After he was arrested Wahlberg made references to 'slant-eyed g***s' in front of police. 

His previous court order was triggered, and he ended up being convicted as an adult and sentenced to three months in jail. He was released after about 45 days.

He is now seeking a pardon for that conviction, saying he accepts he was high on marijuana and other drugs at the time, and has tried to become a better person as an adult.

In an interview in December, the now 43-year-old said: 'I've been looking for redemption (since) the day I woke up and realized that I done some horrific things and was on a path of self-destruction, as well as causing a lot of people harm. 

'When I decided to petition for a pardon, it wasn't based on the things I accomplished in my career. 

'It's been the things I've been able to do in my personal life: giving back to the community and helping kids, especially inner-city kids and at-risk youth and kids growing up in that same situation.'

However, Ms Beals pointed out that this apology does not acknowledge the racial element of the crimes, and therefore does not go far enough.

Beals added that Wahlberg's status and wealth should not place him in a better position than others to erase his misdeeds. She also said that hate crimes should be held to a higher standard.

Representatives for Wahlberg, who stars in new film The Gambler and also appeared in 'Boogie Nights' and 'Lone Survivor,' were not available for comment at the time of publishing.

The state parole board has to hold a hearing on the request by Wahlberg and send a recommendation to the governor, who will decide whether to issue a pardon. 

Final say then rests with the Governor's Council, an elected body. Governors generally don't make pardon decisions until they're leaving office. 

Former Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, issued just four in the final days of his eight-year tenure. His predecessor, Mitt Romney, a Republican, never issued one. 

Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, took office this month.
