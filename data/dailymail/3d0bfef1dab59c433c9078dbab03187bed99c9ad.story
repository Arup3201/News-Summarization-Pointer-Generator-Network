Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has taken to wearing a Bane-style mask to restore his super powers as he ramps up his recovery from a groin strain.

The Arsenal forward has been sidelined with injury since the 2-0 victory against Manchester City last month and was not rushed back for Saturday's game with Crystal Palace.

However, after posting a video of his training session on Instagram, the 21-year-old is clearly doing everything possible to speed his return - including using an elevation training mask.

There was a striking resemblance between Oxlade-Chamberlain and Bane from the film The Dark Knight Rises

Although the mask leaves Oxlade-Chamberlain resembling the super villain from Batman film The Dark Night Rises, it works by restricting an athlete's breathing to mimic the effects of high altitude training - increasing lung stamina, lung capacity and oxygen efficiency.

Judging by the England international's strenuous movements a return to Arsenal's challenge with with Manchester United, Tottenham, Liverpool and Southampton for a cherished Champions League place cannot be too far away.
