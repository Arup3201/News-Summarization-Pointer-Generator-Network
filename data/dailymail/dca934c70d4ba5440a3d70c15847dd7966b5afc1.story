A seaside town which was one of many to suffer in the 1914 German bombardment will unite once again on the 100th anniversary of the attack to commemorate those who were killed.

Following the bombardment 100 years ago, Britain was urged to 'Remember Scarborough!' in a number of campaigns following the loss of 18 people.

Now, as the 100th anniversary approaches, the town is planning a number of special events to commemorate the centenary of the shelling.

On December 16, a maroon will be fired from Scarborough Castle after the name of each of the victims is read out at a special dawn ceremony in the town. The castle will be lit up during the ceremony and a flotilla of boats will be stationed outside the harbour.

At another service, which will be held at Manor Road Cemetery, wreaths will be laid on a new cairn bearing the names of all those who died.

Michael Knaggs, a volunteer at the Scarborough Maritime Heritage Centre, said the event will see Scarborough 'have another 15 minutes of fame'.

The bombardment of Scarborough began just after 8am on the cold December morning almost 100 years ago, and two schools in the town were hit in the attack.

However, due to the early hour and the winter weather, the number of casualties were fewer than they potentially could have been.

Mr Knaggs said: 'If they had been hit a little later, a lot of schoolchildren would have died.

'At one of them, 200 children would have been killed easily. So in that sense, it was quite lucky that it was early in the morning.'

However, 18 people were killed as a result of the raid, including 14-month-old John Shields Ryalls, which led Winston Churchill to call the Germans 'baby killers'.

The outrage caused by the killing of innocent civilians led to the Government using the Scarborough bombardment in its recruitment drive.

Mr Knaggs said: 'Its most important thing was the fact they used it publicity-wise to stir up bad feeling against the Germans after what had happened in Belgium earlier in the war.

'So, for propaganda reasons, it was very important.'

One propaganda poster simply stated: 'Remember Scarborough! Enlist now.'

Another, issued within weeks of the shelling, bore the headline: 'Avenge Scarborough - up and at 'em now.'

The text added: 'The wholesale murder of innocent women and children demands vengeance. Men of England, the innocent victims of German brutality call upon you to avenge them.

'Show German barbarians that Britain's shores cannot be bombarded with impunity. Duty calls you now. Go today to the nearest recruiting depot and offer your services for King and home and country.'

Mr Knaggs said: 'At the time, Scarborough was a very famous holiday resort, lords and ladies and the royal family had been here.

'It was quite wealthy and so it was quite famous and everybody in Great Britain knew about Scarborough, so that's why the Government used Scarborough in all its 'Remember Scarborough', even though four times as many people died in Hartlepool and there was five times as much damage.'

Four of the fatalities that day came from the same family and the Government used photographs of their house on its posters.

Mr Knaggs said: 'Out of the 18 deaths, the four, the Bennett family in Wykeham Street, that was the most tragic. Four people out of seven in the one household.'

Another victim was 15-year-old George Harland Taylor - the only Boy Scout to die in Great Britain during the First World War.

In total, 18 people died in Scarborough and about 200 were injured.

'Over 200 buildings were hit, Mr Knaggs added.

'There were 776 medium format shells fired in 29 minutes, which is quite something.'

Proposals to bomb England during the First World War were first made by Paul Behncke, deputy chief of the German Naval Staff, in August 1914.

Many of the German bombardments focused on the east coast of Britain, with places such as Whitby, Hartlepool, Scarborough, Yarmouth, Lowestoft and Folkestone targeted. London was also besieged.

The raids on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, which took place on December 16, 1914, were attacks by the Imperial German Navy.

In total, they resulted in 137 deaths and left 592 injured.

The first successful raid of 1915 took place overnight between January 19 and 20 when two Zeppelins dropped bombs on Great Yarmouth, Sheringham, King's Lynn in Norfolk and the surrounding villages, killing four and injuring 16. 

Just over a year later came  the bombardment of Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft, also known as the Lowestoft Raid, which saw German and British troops battle in the North Sea.

During the attack in April 1916, four battlecruisers opened fire on Lowestoft, destroying 200 houses which injured 12 people and killed three.

The ships then moved towards Great Yarmouth where they fired more shells. 

In total, 21 British servicemen were killed at sea, while three civilians were killed and 19 were wounded at Lowestoft.

Dozens of other raids on coastal towns and also on London were carried out during 1915 and 1916.

The first daylight raid on London, on June 13, killed a total of 162 people, including 18 children, and injured 432 people.
