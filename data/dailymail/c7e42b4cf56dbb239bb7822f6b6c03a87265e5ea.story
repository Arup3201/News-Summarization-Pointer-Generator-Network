Carrying gas masks became routine for adults and children during the Second World War.

But this collection of amazing pictures shows it was common place for dogs to be equipped with breathing apparatus as well.

The array of fascinating pictures collected by blog Retronaut demonstrate how often canines were called upon to help with the war effort.

Dogs were fitted with gas masks to avoid the deadly fumes and fought for both sides during the Second World War

Gas masks were not just routine for adults and children during the Second World War, but for dogs too. Pictured are two dogs in breathing apparatus either side of a German infantryman in a trench

The black and white photographs show a 
number of dogs in a range of situations, equipped with masks and 
fighting for both sides in the war.

One
picture shows two dogs in a trench with a German infantryman while 
another shows two Alsatians about to go out on patrol with two British 
soldiers. 

Dogs have 
historically been a valuable ally for soldiers in war so it is no 
surprise that safety equipment was designed specifically for them.

They were tasked with a number of different jobs during the Second World War.

The Nazis tried to train them to talk, read and spell in a bid to try and help them win the battle.

The Germans classed canines as being almost as intelligent as humans and tried to create an army of terrifying 'speaking' dogs.

It was hoped they would learn to communicate with their SS masters - with Hitler even setting up a special dog school to teach them to talk.

According to research, dogs were trained to speak and tap out signals using their paws.

One mutt was believed to have uttered the words 'Mein Fuhrer' when asked who Adolf Hitler was.

Amazing pictures have emerged which show how common it was for dogs to be equipped with gas masks during the Second World War. These two Alsatians are about to go out on patrol with two British soldiers

In London, at the start of the affliction in September 1939, more than 400,000 cats and dogs were killed in four days - more than six times the number of civilian deaths throughout the entire country during the whole of the Second World War.

Food for pets was not rationed and the government didn't issue orders for people to kill their pets.

The National Air Raid Precautions Animals Committee, the state body responsible, appealed to owners‘ not to arrange needlessly for the immediate destruction of their pets.

Academics refer to it as The Great British Cat and Dog Massacre of World War Two but it remains a forgotten moment in the history of the Second World War, with few people knowing about it.

Canines were also known to be there for prominent figures during the Second World War, in times of crisis.

The camaraderie Great American leaders President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Gens. George Patton and Dwight Eisenhower shared with their pets is captured in a book by Kathleen Kinsolving.

Dogs of War depicts the strength the leaders derived from their furry friends during the Second World War. 

The famous men relied on their pets 
for 'normalcy and joy' during the turbulent time and sought solace from 
them as they internalised the devastation of the fighting.

Man's best friend proved to be just that during the Second World War, providing vital assistance to soldiers
