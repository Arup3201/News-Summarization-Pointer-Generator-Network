Matthew Charles Supran, 44, who is 6ft 3in tall and weighs 220lbs, is accused of child abuse after allegedly attacking 14-year-old ice hockey player

It is a well known fact that parents watching their children play sports can often become too involved in the game.

But one father is accused of taking things to a new extreme after allegedly attacking a 14-year-old who elbowed his son in the face during a game of ice hockey.

Matthew Charles Supran, 44, who is 6ft 3in tall and weighs 230lb, allegedly ran onto the rink and punched the boy in the face before slamming his head into wooden boards.

The incident happened at around 3pm during a game on Sunday in Lake Worth, Florida, when Supran's son was elbowed in the face by an opposing player and fell over.

The referee deemed the blow to be non-malicious and sent the offending player to the sin bin for five minutes.

However, seemingly unhappy with the call, witnesses say Supran, from Delray Beach, then decided to take matters into his own hands and ran onto the rink.

According to the police report Supran fell onto the victim after hitting him, and the referee and coach had to 'pull the defendant off of the player'.

The parents of the unnamed player said Supran 'would know their son is a juvenile' from other hockey games they have attended.

Supran, who has no prior arrests, was detained at his office on Wednesday morning before being released on a $3,000 (Â£1,850) bail.

Fist fights are between ice hockey players, such as this one between the New York Rangers and Buffalo Sabres, are a popular and common occurrence

Unfortunately for fans of schoolboy ice hockey, the police report did not include information on the outcome of the game.

Ice hockey is known for its extreme violence, with players often slamming each other into side walls while travelling at very high speeds.

Competitors wear full padding and protective helmet to shield against the vicious blows.

It is also common for players to engage in fist fights on the field, with several enforcers put on a team in order to intimidate opponents.

While many fights are spontaneous and result from harsh tackles or perceived unfair play, some are planned.

While not an official part of the game, fighting is tolerated and officials who won't usually dismiss a player for fighting, though they will impose penalties.
