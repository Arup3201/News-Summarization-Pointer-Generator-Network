 A first-born daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will become queen even if she is born before new laws have been passed, Nick Clegg said yesterday.

The Deputy Prime Minister revealed that the new rules were effectively already in place, and had been since a meeting of Commonwealth leaders in Perth, Australia, last October.

The 16 countries who share the British monarch as head of state agreed to change the current 300-year-old law which gives male heirs priority in the Royal line of succession.

Speaking in the Commons, Mr Clegg said: “If the birds and bees were to deliver that blessing to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and indeed the nation, then that little girl would be covered by the provisions of these changes of the rules of succession because they operate from the time of the declaration of the Commonwealth summit last October.

‘It is very important to remember that the rules are de facto in place, even though they have yet to be implemented through legislation in the way that I have described.’

A source close to Mr Clegg said the change in rules was needed now because it would take too long to wait for each of the 16 Commonwealth countries affected to pass a new law.

Mr Clegg’s comments came after a question from Tory MP Helen Grant.

The MP for Maidstone and The Weald said: ‘If the birds and the bees of the very romantic Isle of Anglesey were to conspire and bless our future King of England and his wife with the patter of tiny feet before this law was enacted, and if that royal baby turned out to be a little girl, would she succeed to the throne?’

The rule change was given fresh urgency by the marriage of William and Kate - as it could have provoked a constitutional crisis if their first child is a girl.

But there are fears that the change could fuel the republican movement in Australia, where campaigners could use the opportunity to amend legislation to oust the Queen.

The current law of male primogeniture only allows Elizabeth II to be queen because she did not have any brothers.

It also means that the Princess Royal, the Queen’s second born, is just tenth in line to the throne behind her younger brothers Andrew (fourth) and Edward (seventh).

In Japan, the Chrysanthemum Throne was rocked by a public backlash over succession laws favouring men when Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako had a girl, Aiko, Princess Toshi.

The 15 other countries where Elizabeth II is queen are Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Jamaica, Barbados, the Bahamas, Grenada, Papua New Guinea, the Soloman Islands, Tuvalu, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and St Kitts and Nevis.

The Commonwealth leaders also agreed to overturn the 1701 Act of Settlement, which means that only the Protestant heirs of the Electress Sophia of Hanover, granddaughter of James I, can become king or queen.

The law was brought in following the Glorious Revolution - when a Dutch invasion helped overthrow a Papist king - so that a Catholic could never sit on our throne again.
