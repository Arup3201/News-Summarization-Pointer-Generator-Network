'Van Gaal is really important for me. He gave me a lot of trust during the World Cup and I’m happy to work with him again,' he said.

'He is very strict and direct in what he wants. The players have to do exactly what is best to win the game and every game could be in a different style.

'He reads the game so well and his predictions about the game come true almost every game and that’s how we can prepare 100 per cent.'

There have been question marks over where the former Ajax star would play in the team since he can perform a variety of positions, but the 24-year-old insists heis willing to play in any position Van Gaal asks of him.

'For me, it’s important I can play both as a defender and midfielder,' he said.

'If it’s a game on the left as a defender or as a midfielder it’s up to the coach and I’ll try to do my best.'

Meanwhile, Van Gaal insisted that the arrival of six new players, including Angel di Maria, Ander Hererra, Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo, will not influence the club's policy of providing opportunities for young players.

'We need the youth education, that is the policy of Manchester United also,' he said.

'When you don't let go of players to other clubs then you never allow to give youth players a chance. Because of this policy, we will give youth players a a chance. The question is if they take the chance. It's of course more risky but it's the only way to do it, and United have always grown players in the squad.

'More than eight positions are vacant. They are vacant for the youth. I have already used a lot of youngsters in pre-season and also in the season. I am always willing to give players chances but they have to take them. I can't do that for them.

'The possibility is there and all the youngsters have to know that. Manchester United have come to me because of that.' he added.
