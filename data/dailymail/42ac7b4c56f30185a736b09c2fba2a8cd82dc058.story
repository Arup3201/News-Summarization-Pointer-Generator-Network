Poll: News that the majority of people want to leave the EU will be a blow to the political classes, including David Cameron, who want Britain to stay a member

Only one in three people in Britain think the country should stay in the European Union, a new poll revealed today.

An anti-Brussels attitude appears to be sweeping across the UK despite David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg all claiming the country is better off as a member.

If an in/out referendum took place today 50 per cent of people would demand that Britain leaves, a Financial Times survey by pollsters Harris Interactive found.

Only one third of those asked would vote to stay in and the remaining 17 per cent would not vote.

The majority also believe that the negatives of EU membership currently outweigh the positives.

It comes only a month after David Cameron promised a referendum if the Conservatives win the next General Election in 2017.

The Prime Minister vowed to negotiate to get a range of powers repatriated from Brussels and said he would campaign ‘with all my heart and soul’ for Britain to stay in a reformed EU.

Last week former Tory leader Sir John
Major warned ‘irreconcilable’ Conservative Eurosceptics to keep quiet 
today as he warned they are undermining David Cameron’s attempts to claw
back powers from Brussels.

Key argument: Only a third of people asked thought the British economy would be worse off leaving Brussels, the survey found

The
former prime minister described Mr Cameron’s decision to promise a 
referendum in 2017 as a ‘gamble’ that could lead to Britain’s exit from 
Europe and warned the issue had ‘come close to destroying the 
Conservative Party’ in the past.

Today's results are based on a survey of more than 2,000 people.

Less than a third of people asked 
thought the British economy would be worse off outside the Union and 
those asked placed the EU at 14th out of 15 on the list of UK 
priorities.

The NHS, schools and the economy were the most important.

But despite the anti-EU sentiment, it may not mean a lot more votes for UKIP.

Only 10 per cent of people asked was 'very or extremely confident' leader Nigel Farage could get the best deal for Britain, compared to 16 per cent for David Cameron.

A total of 11 per cent said they were more likely to support UKIP but 25 per cent said they would be less likely to.
