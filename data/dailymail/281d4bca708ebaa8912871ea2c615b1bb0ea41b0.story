An Indian father has told MailOnline how he tortured and murdered his 14-year-old daughter's rapist - who also got her pregnant in a sickening attack.

The 36-year-old father lured the suspected rapist to his Delhi home and cooked him dinner before slipping him a sleeping pill, torturing him and killing him.

He said: 'Initially, I didn’t want to kill him and asked him to quietly leave my home and life but he taunted me. I became very, very angry and lost my mind. 

'I wrapped a towel around his neck and tied his hand, and dragged him to the floor. I switched on the gas and put the iron tongs and made it hot.

'I thought he was dead but he was still breathing, so with one hand I strangled him and also put the heated tong on his genitals.

'He screamed so loudly so I put a part of the towel in his mouth to silence his noise. 

'I burnt his genitals a second time, his body twisted and I was so enraged that I did it a third time in succession. After some time he stopped breathing and collapsed on the ground.' 

The father-of-six, who cannot be named but is from the Khajuri Khas region, said: 'I killed him to avenge what he did to my daughter. He spoilt her childhood. She was not be same girl as she was.'

He then turned himself in to the police who arrested and charged him with murder - a crime carries a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment in India.

From his prison cell he said: 'It was not easy for me after that. I drank half the cold drink left in the bottle and soothed my mind. When I got some composure I realised what I had done. I decided to surrender to authorities.

'I could have run away and even destroyed the body but instead I went to police after three hours and told them about what I had done. He was a blot on society and a constant threat to women.'

The murdered attacker, who was a tenant of the girl's father, reportedly attacked the girl when he found her home alone and threatened to kill her if she told anyone.

She eventually confessed to her father when symptoms of morning sickness began to surface.

He kept the secret to himself for two months, afraid the revelation would tarnish the honour of his daughter and his family.

He said: 'After my daughter told me about what happened to her I became very worried and was not able to sleep or eat properly for few days and then I got scared about the future of my girl.

'I didn’t share this info even with my own parents or brother who all live with me. I told my wife and told her not to speak to anyone about it because it would bring bad name for us and also would make it difficult for my daughter to get married.

'Even my little daughter stopped smiling and stopped eating properly or going out with her friends while he continued with his normal life and had no remorse.

'Can you imagine this man is the father of two married daughters - yet he dared to do this my young innocent daughter.'

The number of rapes being reported in India has risen annually over the last five years, according to the country's Ministry of Home Affairs. The frequency of reported attacks against girls aged 14 to 18 has almost tripled in that time.

Activists say this could be in part down to increased awareness which has inspired more women to report sexual violence.

According to Mandakini Surie, a Senior Program Officer at the Asia Foundation, the 'Nirbhaya' incident in 2012, which involved the gang-rape of a 23-year-old woman on a private bus, thrust the issue of women's safety into the spotlight.

She said: 'More and more women are coming forward to report instances of rape, assault, domestic violence and abuse even as the government has introduced more stringent legislation on sexual assault and introduced fast track courts to deal with rape cases.'

However, victims of rape can face personal and professional discrimination.

Surie added: 'Despite the rapid economic progress that India has made over the last decade, it remains - socially and culturally - a deeply patriarchal society.

'Victims who have come forward have reportedly faced social ostracisation, finding it difficult in many cases to find employment, marry and live full lives.'

Violent protests erupted in India in 2012 when the girl known as 'Nirbhaya' was thrown off a moving bus following her sexual assault.

Campaigners said it highlighted the incompetence of local police authorities in protecting women against sexual violence.

More recently in the northern region of Kumaon, thousands of angry protesters took to the streets over the rape of a seven-year-old.

Kahsish Shand's dead body, found five days after her uncle's wedding in Haldwani, showed signs of serious hemorrhaging through sexual assault. 

The father of the 14-year-old, assaulted by a man he considered family, believed he needed to take the law into his own hands.

He said: 'I started thinking what is point of living this life if I can’t get justice for my daughter.

'I do not regret that I took revenge of what he did.
