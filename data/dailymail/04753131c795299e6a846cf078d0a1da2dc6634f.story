A jury in eastern Oklahoma has convicted a 27-year-old man of shooting dead his pregnant girlfriend and her unborn baby after she refused to get an abortion.

The jury deliberated almost seven hours Thursday before convicting Christopher Kenyon Simpson, of Spiro, in the death of 20-year-old Ka'loni Flynn, of Fort Smith, Arkansas.

The jurors recommended the maximum sentence of life in prison without parole. Simpson is scheduled to be sentenced November 8.

Prosecutors allege that Simpson, who has at least one child from a past relationship, shot Flynn twice in the head because he did not want another baby to support. A DNA expert testified that the 27-year-old fathered the 12-week-old fetus.

‘I'm glad it's over. I'm glad we got the verdict we got,’ said Flynn's father, Herbert Flynn. ‘She deserved it.’

During closing arguments, Crawford County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Jacob Howell showed a photograph of Flynn's body in the driver's seat of car, with bullet wounds to her temple and forehead. Some audience members gasped loudly in shock.

‘We know that's how we got here,’ Howell said, indicating the photo.

Prosecutors acknowledged that the case against Simpson was complicated and mostly circumstantial.

‘I hope we showed you this was investigated thoroughly, and that every possible suspect was investigated and excluded except one,’ Howell said.

Simpson's attorney, Warren Gotcher, argued that no witnesses could place Simpson at the crime scene and that his client was innocent.

But prosecutor Anthony Evans said Simpson was trying to deflect blame because ‘the defendant has the spotlight on him, and it's hot, and he needs to get it off him. So what does he do? He pushes it over here. Desperate men do desperate things.’

Flynn was discovered shot dead execution-style in her parked car on McGinnis Lane in LeFlore County at around 3am on April 9.

In late June, police arrested Flynn's boyfriend, Christopher Simpson, on murder charges. 

According to a police affidavit, the couple had been dating for about three months when the 20-year-old found out she was pregnant.

Simpson reportedly became angry when he learned that he was going to be a father again, but according to Flynn's dad, his daughter refused to end the pregnancy because she did not believe in abortion.

Herbert Flynn Jr told the station 5News after Simpson's arrest that on the night of his daughter's murder, she was planning to meet with her boyfriend to ask for help in applying for government assistance.

Around the time of the shooting, Simpson was late on child support payments for his 7-year-old daughter, and according to a local sheriff, he had made statements to his friends that he did not want another child.

After Flynn's death, a witness told police that Simpson bragged to him that his girlfriend’s killing will never be solved because it was 'too clean' and 'the perfect murder.'

The 20-year-old woman, who aspired to be a nurse, allegedly told a friend a short time before the slaying that Simpson had threatened to end the pregnancy for her if she refused to abort the baby.
