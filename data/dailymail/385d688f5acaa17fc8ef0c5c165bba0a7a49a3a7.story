A 71-year-old grandfather proved to be tougher than would-be robbers expected, putting up a fight to protect his Ashfield convenience store when it was attacked by men with machetes on Friday night.

Theo Zagoridis was manning his shop on the main street in Ashfield, in Sydney's inner west, when two men entered the premises at approximately 8.40pm and threatened him with their weapons.

'They said "give me your money". I thought it was a joke, I told them to bu***r off,' Mr Zagoridis said.

A defiant Mr Zagoridis refused to give in to their demands, and accosted the man holding the machete to prevent him from wielding it, wrapping him in a 'bear hug'.

'I grabbed him so he couldn't swing his arms and the other man, the look out, came behind me and pulled my arms and then they just took off,' he told Nine News.

Two men, believed to be working with the pair who attacked Mr Zagoridis Sunny's Grocery store, also entered a convenience store on Alt Street, just opposite the scene of the crime.

The men threatened a young worker behind the counter and shot her in the face with a pellet air-gun.  

One of the would-be robbers left his baseball cap at the scene, a reminder of the nights unexpected turn of events which will now be used as evidence by police.

The two men fled under an overpass and into a waiting car.  

Mr Zagoridis suffered two deep gashes and was treated by paramedics at the scene. 

'They said "give me your money". I thought it was a joke, I told them to bu***r off,' Mr Zagoridis said

The brush with violence didn't rattle the 71-year-old, who said that he would be glad to see the assailants again and would be prepared with weapons of his own. 

'Get off your ass and get a job you bludger- and come and see me again, I'd love to see you,' Mr Zagoridis said.

'I've got a nice baseball bat, I'd love to see them,' he told Nine News.

'The behaviours by all of these offenders are very brazen, and we are lucky that nobody has sustained serious injury', said Acting Inspector Melanie Leaity.

The ringleader is believed to be in his late 40's, and the other three are believed to be younger. 

Police are urging anyone with more information to contact them through the Crime Stoppers hotline 1800 333 000.
