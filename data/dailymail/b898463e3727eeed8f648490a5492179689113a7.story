The driver who survived being crushed between two big rigs in a nightmare pileup on an icy Oregon freeway is sharing details of his near death experience.

Kyle Whitby says that he was not scared or nervous as the event unfolded, in just seconds, knowing that God had a plan for him - and that he is no luckier than any other person.

'I'm not better,' explained the 27-year-old, who has a pregnant wife and son at home..

'I just know that I can't control it, the Heavenly Father does have a plan for us, and we have the ability to choose and make our own choices. But he does watch out for us.'

In fact it was business as usual for him and his family the day after the crash, as they all went to church together he told The Oregonian.  

His wife Camille however can't even bring herself to see the photo.

'I knew it was bad. Smashed between two semis, it's not going to be good,' she said.

'It's unreal how bad it is.'

To be safe though, she pinches him from time to time to make sure he is still there. 

 Whitby has made on minor change he admits, saying; 'I make sure to say thank you more often.'

No wiggle room: The two big rigs, right, ended up practically sandwiched together in the pileup, which did not kill anybody

Whitby, 27, made headlines when a photo of him staring calmly from the mangled wreckage of his Chevy Silverado taken after the two semi-trucks smashed into each other on the I-84 in Oregon with him in the middle went public.

Despite his precarious position wedged between the two metal trailers, and with a steering column tight against his leg, Whitby emerged from the deathtrap almost entirely unscathed. 

He posed for the photograph, taken by another truck driver involved in the  50-driver pileup, which left 18-wheelers sprawled across the icy freeway outside Baker City, Oregon.

Whitby described the terrifying moments before his unlikely survival, saying he swerved to avoid a jackknifed truck - only to get crushed by another out of control big rig.

He had been driving up an incline behind the vehicle for a while, Whitby said, but backed away because the fog was so thick.

The next time he saw it, the big rig was splayed across the lanes of the freeway, leaving him nowhere to go.

He tried to swerve round it, but hit the back end and was left sat on the road, side-on to approaching traffic.

Huge: As many as 50 vehicles, mostly trucks, were caught up in the wreckage

Next, he noticed a second big rig barreling towards him, with no way to avoid him. 'I just braced and hoped that everything would be all right', Whitby said.

The next thing he knew, the crash was over and he was surrounded by broken glass and mangled metal - but was otherwise unharmed.

Whitby, a farmer from Pasco, Washington, managed to cut himself free of his seatbelt, and move the steering column from his leg.

He then shouted for help - and was rescued by Sergi Karplyuk, who drove the second truck in the crash. Whitby, now safe, posed for the incredible picture before getting out.

After looking himself over, Whitby realized he was hardly injured at all. He told The Oregonian: 'I've got two Band-Aids on my right ring finger. And a little bit of ice on my left eye.'

Twelve people were taken to hospital as a result of the pileup, one of whom was in critical condition Sunday. The freeway has since been re-opened.

More than 20 cars piled up on I-76 in Philadelphia after freezing rain on Sunday morning

At least four people have died and dozens more injured after freezing rain hit the Northeast on Sunday morning.

A pair of multi-car pileups - including one involving dozens of vehicles - in icy conditions on interstates in the Philadelphia area claimed at least three lives as authorities reported hundreds of crashes were reported across eastern Pennsylvania.

A crash involving an estimated 30 to 50 vehicles on Interstate 76 early on Sunday killed one person, state police said. The crash blamed on 'flash-freezing' prompted closure of the highway in both directions, although one lane was reopened in the afternoon.

Two other people were killed in a crash involving multiple vehicles on Interstate 476, police said.

In Connecticut, police cited slippery conditions in a crash that killed an 88-year-old woman who struck a utility pole in New Haven.

Splayed: This mail truck and another container vehicle were badly damaged on the Oregon road

Caved cab: Another busted big rig is pictured on the road amidst the devastation caused by the pileup

Cold: Icy conditions, as well as wind and fog, contributed to dangerous conditions on the I-84
