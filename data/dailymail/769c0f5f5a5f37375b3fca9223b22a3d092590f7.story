It tells the story of vicar Adam Smallbone as he struggles to support his inner-city church with dwindling funds and ever fewer worshippers.

But the sitcom Rev makes painful viewing for one fan – because it mirrors the reality he faces every day.

The Rev Paul Turp is the vicar of St Leonard’s in Shoreditch, East London, which provides the backdrop for the successful cult show and is also its inspiration.

Just like his fictional equivalent, he is fighting to avert the threat of his parish going bankrupt and the closure of his church.

Mr Turp receives a £20,000 location fee from the BBC and a £30,000 subsidy from the Church of England but this is not enough to save the Grade I-listed 18th century building which is now on the English Heritage Risk Register.

The desperate state of affairs mirrors that faced by the Rev Adam Smallbone, played by Tom Hollander, in the fictional St Saviour in the Marshes.

In the BBC 2 series, he is battling to save the crumbling building with a broken stained glass window, the dwindling of his congregation in an increasingly secular world and the competition from the rise of Islam.

Mr Turp, the vicar of St Leonard’s since 1983, said the show is so accurate it is sometimes  hard to watch.

His parish, which has a congregation of 150, needs £90,000 a year from outside the Church to stay afloat but receives nowhere near enough.

Struggle: St Leonard's in Shoreditch, East London, is just one of thousands of churches struggling to stay open

The changing landscape of the East End has seen families who would have made up the bulk of its congregation move away to be replaced by younger, secular residents. There are also now 13 mosques in the borough. ‘We will do a lot of prayer and hope to pull a miraculous rabbit out of an as yet non-existent hat’, said Mr Turp, 65.

‘Last year we spent £250,000 working on the roof and the year before £180,000 on the roof and £92,000 on railings and gates. Rev shows the truth about people who love their church and understand it but do not have the resources to run it.’

Now in its third series – the final episode is on Monday night – the sitcom is written by James Wood and Hollander, who also appeared in Pirates of the Caribbean. It has 1.7million viewers and has been sold to 140 countries.

After the initial series, Hollander, 46, said audiences identified with his character because he was ‘normal’ – with scenes showing him both smoking and drinking. ‘He’s a flawed and vulnerable person,’ he said. ‘I’ve met lots of vicars while making this and they’re often vulnerable.’

The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, has described the show as ‘rather really good’, saying it shows ‘the continuing commitment of the Church to run-down and challenging areas’.

The Bishop of Buckingham, the Rt Rev Alan Wilson, has said: ‘At last the BBC has moved beyond the Vicar of Dibley.’
