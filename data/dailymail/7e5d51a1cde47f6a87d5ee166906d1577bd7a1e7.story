They had enjoyed a sumptuous three-course meal including scallops and steak, washed down with copious amounts of vintage champagne and other fine wines.

But there was a reason the four diners at the upmarket restaurant seemed unconcerned about the size of the tab that was being run up – they never intended to pay.

The three men and a woman finished their desserts and fled, leaving behind an unpaid bill for £520.

The diners: Police have released this CCTV image of three men and a woman believed to be in their 40s or 50s who fled the Milsoms restaurant in Dedham, Essex, without paying their £520 bill

Deceitful: The group enjoyed a meal of scallops, fillets of beef and lamb shanks, accompanied by numerous bottles of wine and champagne before they did a runner

However, that was not before their faces had been captured on the restaurant’s CCTV.

Essex Police have released an image of the group in a bid to track them down.

The four dined at Milsoms restaurant in Dedham, near Colchester, last Saturday evening.

They ordered scallops, a prawn 
cocktail and spring rolls for starters, beef fillet, lamb shanks and cod
for their main course, and ice cream sundaes for dessert.

Between them they drank two bottles 
of 2003 Dom Perignon champagne at £148.40 each, an Italian pinot grigio 
at £23.50, and two bottles of £35 rioja.

At the end of the meal, the woman and two of the men simply left the restaurant and started the car.

The third man told staff he would pay
the bill after going to the lavatory. He went to the lavatory, then ran
off to the getaway vehicle.

As the restaurant does not take bookings, it has no clues to the culprits’ identities except for the CCTV footage.

Owner Paul Milsom said: ‘They obviously decided they were going to do this and ran up a big bill.

'Our average spend is not that high, 
and this was clearly premeditated which is very disheartening. They knew
what they were doing. This was no mistake.

‘It hardly ever happens and we have 
the CCTV to ensure if it does we can identify the people involved. We 
are hoping someone may recognise them and come forward.’

'Disheartening': Milsoms Restaurant owner Paul Milsom said this was the first time customers had purposely run up a huge bill with the intention of not paying for it

Mr Milsom said it was the first time people had deliberately run up a bill on that scale and then left without paying.

‘People willing to steal are always out there, it is the same as people shoplifting,’ he said.

Essex Police said: ‘Making off 
without payment is an offence often associated with petrol stations so 
this is not the circumstances in which we usually expect to see it 
reported.’

Anyone with information can call PC Dan Smith at Colchester Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
