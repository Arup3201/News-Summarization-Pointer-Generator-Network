So the title race is wide open after another absorbing weekend in the Premier League.

Wins for Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City saw Chelsea's grip on first place loosen somewhat and now Jose Mourinho's men face a potential season-defining game this Saturday.

The Blues host London rivals Arsenal at Stamford Bridge in the lunchtime kick-off, where the winner will certainly strengthen their claims to go on and lift the title come May.

Before that, Chelsea will be hoping to deny old boy Didier Drogba and his Galatasaray side as they bid to book their place in the quarter finals of the Champions League.

Crunch time: It's a massive week for Manchester United who need to rescue their ailing season with a Champions League win over Olympiacos

All smiles: Liverpool's victory at Old Trafford puts them firmly in the title picture

But back to domestic matters, 
Liverpool visit relegation threatened Cardiff where three points are 
vital for both teams in their respective battles, as is the case when 
Manchester City host Fulham.

How will those games shape the table come 5pm on Saturday?

Elsewhere,
 it's crunch time for Manchester United. David Moyes needs his side to 
reverse a 2-0 first leg defeat by Olympiacos if they are to stay in 
Europe's elite competition.

And
 they'll be searching for a win over struggling West Ham to get their 
hopes of a top-four finish back on track on Saturday evening at Upton 
Park.
