The mother of Mark Duggan, whose death sparked riots after he was shot dead by police, has been given permission to challenge the inquest ruling that he was lawfully killed.

After considering papers in the case, Mr Justice Mitting has ruled that Pamela Duggan can apply for judicial review on the grounds that the coroner’s direction to the jury in relation to lawful killing was ‘arguably inadequate’.

Her lawyers will contend that the coroner did not address questions which, if they had been considered, meant such a verdict could not stand.

Family members and supporters reacted angrily over the jury’s conclusion at the Royal Courts of Justice in January that police acted lawfully when they shot Duggan, 29, in August 2011 in Tottenham, north London.

The inquest jury found he was lawfully killed by a police marksman, despite being unarmed when he was shot.

Police officers intercepted the vehicle he was in on the basis of intelligence that he was part of a gang and had collected a gun.

Mrs Duggan's lawyers will contend at a full hearing on a date yet to be fixed that the coroner did not address questions which, if they had been addressed, meant the lawful killing verdict could not stand.

The judge said the case should go before a panel of judges including either the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, or the President of the Queen's Bench Division, Sir Brian Leveson.
