Saudi Arabia's feared morality police say they will not punish men who walk around in their underwear - but women still face harsh punishments if they violate strict laws on women's dress codes.

The Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice has denied reports of a ban to counter the controversial trend of young men frequenting shopping malls in their undershirts and long pyjamas.

Women, however, are still expected to cover their body with a cloak, head covering and a veil according to the country's strict Islamic laws.

'The commission has not issued any statement about this matter and violations in general are addressed according to the existing regulations,' Najm Al Dhufairi, a spokesman for the commission, reported Saudi news website Albawaba.

Saudi daily Al Yaum reported that the commission had called for a ban on young men walking into shopping malls wearing white undershirts and long underpants usually worn under the traditional robes, known as a thawb or dishdasha.

The commission reportedly took the decision because more and more young men are doing it as an act of rebellion.

Spokesman Ziad Al Ruqaiti said that complaints about young men 'parading in their undershirts and long underpants in shopping malls' was often reported by families, the third biggest complaint by shoppers after verbal assaults and harassment.

He added: 'Usually the security services at the shopping malls deal with such incidents and the police intervene only when matters get out of their control.'

Strict: Women face persecution if they don't cover up in Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islam prohibits men and women who are not immediate relatives from mingling and women from driving. The playing of music, dancing and many movies also are a concern for hard-liners who believe they violate religious and moral values.

A thawb, or dishdasha, is an ankle-length robe commonly worn in Arab countries.

The word thawb is the standard Arabic word for 'a garment'.

It is the traditional Arab clothing for men throughout the Middle East and parts of Africa.

Those who refuse to obey their orders are often beaten by the religious police, known as mutaween, and sometimes put in jail.

Many in Saudi Arabia say they exploit their broad mandate to interfere in people's lives.

Perhaps the most serious and widely criticised incident attributed to them occurred on March 11, 2002, when they prevented schoolgirls from escaping a burning school in Mecca, because the girls were not wearing headscarves and robes.

Fifteen girls died and 50 were injured as a result.

Widespread public criticism followed, both internationally and within Saudi Arabia.

The many restrictions on women have led to high rates of female unemployment, officially estimated at around 30 per cent.

The country sent two female athletes to the London Olympics last year, ending the Muslim country's record of sending only all-male teams to the Games.

Comments in the Saudi blogosphere were divided about the underwear issue. One posted: 'I can assure you that most of these young men do it not out of conviction, but rather as a daring challenge', while another claimed the men do it: 'because they have plenty of free time and no real place where they can use their potential'.

The second poster was likely referring to high levels of unemployment in Saudi Arabia, estimated to be 35% among men in their 20s.

'Get them busy by engaging them in activities they like and they will put an end to their unusual behaviour,' was the advice.

One took a harsher view: 'They just want to be different even if their outfits clash with good taste and public decency. They are moral outcasts who need help.'
