McLaren, one of the UK’s automotive success stories, celebrates its 50th birthday today.

The F1 company started life in a small suburban office but now employs some 2,000 workers based in its futuristic, multimillion pound factory, where F1 cars are built and tested, as well as McLaren’s road cars.

Engineers are currently finishing the first batch of the firm’s £866,000 P1 supercars that are due to be delivered to lucky customers next year.

McLaren's headquarters, which includes the F1 factory, was designed by architect Sir Norman Foster and opened by the Queen in 2004.

It houses some cutting-edge manufacturing facilities including its factory, wind tunnel, simulators, R&D centres for the F1 team as well as the top secret centre where the McLaren road cars are developed.

In 1993 McLaren 
Automotive, launched the F1roadcar, which 20 years on, 
it is still regarded by many as the greatest supercar of all time.

More 
recently, it has rolled out both the 12C and 
12C Spider high-performance sports cars and the McLaren P1- its newest supercar.

Proving that grubby production lines have come a very long way, McLaren's airy and stylish production centre was opened in 2011 and is where all the road cars are produced.

The company started life 50 years ago and its factory in Colnbrook is pictured in 1973

It includes a production line where cars are built 
by hand, a paint shop and a rolling road where cars are 
tested before going out on a test drive ahead of being 
shipped off to the customer.

The internal space is large enough to accommodate three jumbo jets, but the huge building in Woking is largely hidden from view and is carbon neutral.

The production centre has the capacity to produce 4,500 cars a 
year, a number that will be realised in 2015 when the company’s model 
portfolio expands to three separate models - the McLaren 12C, forthcoming P1 and a mystery unnamed model.

McLaren's chairman, Ron Dennis, explained the move into road cars.

He said: “McLaren’s first and founding principle was to compete successfully in motor sport and particularly Formula 1.

'That goal has taken us to great heights, from an engineering and innovation perspective, and by rewarding our people for their endeavours over many long seasons of top level motor racing.

'But despite all the trophies and great racing successes, there comes a time when the maturity of a company and its future development depends on broadening its activities.

It used to take 10 days to transform a pile of raw materials into McLaren's current supercar, the MP4-12C (pictured) but it now takes around five as the process has evolved to become more streamlined

'We have long held the dream of building a range of innovative McLaren sports cars. Sports cars that take the raw elements of Formula 1 principles, processes and performance and forge them into a unique package that adds the requirements of quality, efficiency, comfort and reliability – traditionally  opposing goals that I know we can deliver.'

A new car joins the production line every 45 minutes and the space is surprisingly quiet as the building has been designed to conceal the really heavy machinery that performs seriously noisy processes like the body wash, so the production hall is calm.

Lord Foster, founder and chairman of architecture practice Foster + Partners, said: 'The McLaren Production Centre is a further leap forward in the evolution of industrial buildings, both socially and in terms of working conditions and technologically in its flexibility and the sophistication of its services integration.

'The scale and grandeur of the main hall is a fitting complement to the perfection of the McLaren cars, which emerge from its production line.'

The company has come a long way from its beginnings in the London suburb of New Malden before settling on a small factory in Colnbrook, near Heathrow.

The logistics floor will handle 50-60,000 components a day; every MP4-12C is made up of around 13,000 component

Engineers are currently working on McLaren's new car- - the P1 - which should be delivered to customers next year

McLaren was established by New Zealander Bruce McLaren in 1963, who took the team into Formula One in 1966 at the Monoco Grand Prix.

He tragically died while testing a car in 1970, but the company he founded has gone on to win 12 drivers' and 8 constructors' championships.

Teddy Mayer lead the team to its first World Constructors' Championship in 1974 with Brazilian driver Emerson Fittipaldi, who also won the World Drivers' Championship that year.

The P1 was designed and is being built at McLaren's Woking-based production centre

On the day of the company's 50th birthday, Mr Dennis said: 'McLaren started as the dream of one man, and it's since grown to encompass the hopes and dreams of more than 2000 men and women, who work as tirelessly as Bruce McLaren himself once did to ensure that everything we do reflects well when compared with everything we've ever achieved.'

The company is throwing a huge party at its technical centre for its staff, where F1 drivers have driven historic cars.

F1 driver Jenson Button said: 'I’ve never hidden
my pride at being a McLaren driver. I grew up watching this team 
achieving great things with Ayrton Senna and my racing hero, Alain 
Prost. And I firmly believe this team will be great again; this is an 
organisation you can never discount – their appetite for winning is 
unlike anything I’ve ever seen and, rest assured, we will be back at the
front soon.

'For me, it’s hugely gratifying to not only be at 
MTC on the actual day of the anniversary, but to spend time with the 
thousands of people who all work with such skill and enthusiasm to make 
McLaren great.'
