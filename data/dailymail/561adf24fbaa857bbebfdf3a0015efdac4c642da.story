Stranded: Footage taken on the train show how passengers were crammed in on the Penzance to London Paddington service for almost six hours

Furious passengers yesterday attacked one of Britain’s leading rail firms over a 12-hour nightmare trip in third world ‘cattle truck’ conditions.

Nearly 500 passengers were stranded in the countryside for almost six hours when brakes on their 30-year-old First Great Western train broke down.

Customers on the overcrowded service were left thirsty and hungry as water was rationed, refreshments ran out and the lavatories blocked up. Those seeking to quench their thirst were outraged to be charged for hot drinks, said witnesses.

The fiasco on Sunday’s 11am service from Penzance to London Paddington has been described as ‘horrific’ and a ‘chaotic disaster’.

FGW faces a stream of compensation claims after admitting a catalogue of failures and announced an independent inquiry.

The rail company – nicknamed ‘Worst Late Western’ for its bad performance – is already under fire for running the most overcrowded service in Britain, from Henley-on-Thames to Paddington.

The firm is part of transport giant First Group whose chief executive Tim O’Toole is on track for a pay-plus-perks deal of £1.25million this year, including a ‘retention bonus’ of more than £220,000.

FGW also chairs the Government’s Rail Delivery Group, set up by ministers to improve services.

Ordeal: Passengers on the 'horrific' 11am First Great Western train from Penzance to London Paddington said they were 'treated like cattle' because there was not enough food, water or seats

Anger: These passengers told how they were trapped on a train which ran out of water 'early on' and how they slowly waited to be rescued because of the rural location the train broke down in

A highly embarrassed senior executive –
travelling on the stricken train and dressed in holiday shorts and 
shirt – was filmed giving a grovelling apology to a carriage full of 
passengers.

He admitted that passengers had been ‘misled’ by staff, that the rail 
firm had handled matters appallingly and promised to raise the fiasco 
personally with directors, pledging: ‘I will have my say, believe me, 
because I am as deeply disgruntled.’

He added: ‘I’m a passenger on this train and I’m as frustrated as you 
are.’ The train stalled near Pewsey, Wiltshire, at about 3.45pm after a 
fractured air pipe caused the brakes to lock. It took engineers two 
hours to reach the train and three and a quarter to fix it.

The train began moving again at about 9pm and arrived at Paddington at about 10.15pm – five hours and 40 minutes late.

The trains date back to the 1980s, but the firm said age was not the issue as the internal mechanics are about six years old.

Toni Heath, 53, a property developer from Clerkenwell, London, returning
from a weekend break in Cornwall claimed that, while passengers were 
trapped inside the train, staff stood outside in a field smoking and 
stretching their legs.

At first, they said someone must have pulled the emergency cord, he said
– and a train sent to shunt them didn’t work because its brakes were 
locked.

‘The train was massively overcrowded, families were sitting on the floor
– no seats had been reserved because of a computer error,’ he added. 
‘We paid £200 for a ticket and we got that shambles. Children were 
crying and vomiting. It was truly horrendous.’

Passengers voiced frustration on Twitter. One, Sarah, said they had been
‘treated like cattle’ adding: ‘No food, no water, no air con, no 
toilets flushing! Management on trains not communicating.’

A male passenger complained: ‘The train was overcrowded before it even 
broke down. There was probably 20 or 30 people in each carriage who 
couldn’t sit down.’

Company managing director Mark Hopwood said later: ‘Clearly what I need 
to do is say sorry. We are sorry. We need to investigate what’s gone on 
and we need to learn some lessons quickly from this. It took a lot 
longer to find the fault than we wanted.
