In Walthamstow, the sky was red with fireworks. In the suburbs of Paris, the streets were packed in celebration. In Algeria itself, the whole country reached a frenzy of euphoria.

Algeria has waited a long time for this. They should have reached the second phase of the World Cup in 1982; finally, 32 years on, a draw against Russia took them out of the group for the first time.

That 1982 side lives on in the romantic imagination as one of the great what- might-have-beens.

Four years earlier, Tunisia had beaten Mexico to become the first African side to win a match at the World Cup, but that achievement was nothing to the shock of  Algeria’s win over West Germany in Gijon.

Past glory: The Algerian coach and players celebrate victory in 1982 when they beat West Germany

Revenge: Algeria were knocked out despite winning in '82 after the 'Anschlus' - now they want revenge

They then lost to Austria but beat Chile and would have gone through with any result other than a narrow West German victory over Austria in their final game — a match played after Algeria’s last game.

West Germany, of course, won what became known as the Anschluss match 1-0 and Algeria, in the cruellest circumstances, were out.

‘We have not forgotten,’ Algeria’s Bosnian coach Vahid Halilhodzic warned before the tournament.

He also has unfinished business at the World Cup. He was part of the Yugoslavia squad in Spain, but was largely kept out of the side by Safet Susic, who coached Bosnia at this World Cup.

Then he should have taken Ivory Coast to the 2010 World Cup, only to be sacked following defeat to — coincidentally — Algeria in the quarter-final of the Cup of Nations.

His side took the lead with a minute to go, only to concede an injury-time equaliser and then a winner two minutes into extra-time.

The rest of the world — Algerians included — may be surprised by what the country have achieved, but Halilhodzic has always given the impression that he expected progress to at least the round of 16.

‘I’ve succeeded wherever I’ve been,’ he shrugged.

He won a league title and an African Champions League with Raja Casablanca. He took Lille to promotion and then into the Champions League. He saved Rennes from relegation. He won the league with Dinamo Zagreb.

He is as irascible as he is intelligent, but he has been successful. 

He is also utterly his own man. Halilhodzic retired from his playing career following the death of his mother. During the Yugoslav War, he returned to Mostar to defend his home and remained even after being wounded, only leaving after Croatian nationalists threatened his life, eventually destroying his home.

He has a clear idea of how football should be played and has reshaped the Algerian game to that image.

When Algeria shocked West  Germany they were an attractive side based around the direct attacking play of the likes of Rabah Madjer, Lakhdar Belloumi and Salah Assad.

Success: Vahid Halihodzic has taken Algeria further than many outside the country expected

Unique: Halihodzic, who has had a difficult relationship with the World Cup, is confident in his own abilities

Costa RicaGroup D was supposed to be three giants plus Costa Rica, yet it was the Concacaf side who came top of the group.

Their method is simple: pack men behind the ball and look to break using the playmaking ability of Bryan Ruiz and the lone front-running of Joel Campbell.

MexicoMexico were a shambles in qualifying, with Miguel Herrera their fourth coach in 12 months.

But they got to Brazil in the end, and they have been defensively sound and neat in possession, inspired by the goalkeeping of Guillermo Ochoa and the calm of Rafael Marquez, 35.

Nigeria‘One day I will be in charge of Nigeria, and then they will know what a coach is,’ said Stephen Keshi in 2006.

He has been as good as his word, ending a 19-year trophy drought by winning the Cup of Nations then leading them to the last 16 of the World Cup. The star is Emmanuel Emenike.

USAFootball in the United States is improving, but few would have picked them to get past Portugal and Ghana.

They are extremely fit and have a tremendous spirit and, if they were fortunate to beat Ghana, they were much the better side in drawing 2-2 with the Portuguese.

They retained that reputation through the Eighties when they were regular contenders for the African Cup of Nations before finally winning it on home soil in 1990.

The civil war of the Nineties broke up that side, though, and more recently Algeria have become more noted for the sort of dour defence they demonstrated in drawing 0-0 with England at the last World Cup.

Halilhodzic, though, has unleashed the attacking instinct of Algerian football. They are good to watch again and the coach must take credit for that.

The other key figure in the creation of this side has been the president of the football federation, Mohamed Raouraoua.

Moment of joy: Islam Slimani headed home against Russia to send Algeria into the last 16 for the first time

Not only did he work with tremendous energy to keep football alive during the worst days of the war, but he lobbied FIFA to change their rules on national eligibility.

As a result, Algeria have been able to draw from the vast diaspora to the extent that 16 of the 23-man squad were born in France.

As ever, results outweigh all else, and if Algeria could shock Germany and gain their revenge for 1982, every member of the side would be celebrated wherever there are Algerians.
