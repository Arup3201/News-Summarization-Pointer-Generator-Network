Witold Sobkow said the Polish were opting to stay and make the most  of Poland's blossoming economy, rather than to move to Britain

Polish people want to stay in their home country rather than move to the UK because there are 'more opportunities' for them at home, according to the country’s ambassador.

Witold Sobkow said that more and more men and women were opting to stay and make the most of Poland’s blossoming economy, rather than to move to Britain.

Mr Sobkow, Poland's ambassador to the UK, said the 'huge wave' of migration from his home land was now over.

He told the Independent: 'There are more opportunities in Poland, we have had huge economic success, wages are higher in Poland now and there are more jobs in many parts of Poland, so I think this is over.'

He added: 'Of course people would like to stay in Poland and not live abroad.

'They love the UK but if you are at home there is no place like home.'

He was speaking ahead of the ten year anniversary of Poland joining the European Union.

According to official figures, 29,000 Poles came to Britain in 2012, compared with 88,000 in 2007.

Earlier this month officials admitted that hundreds of thousands of Eastern European immigrants came into Britain uncounted because inspectors were at the wrong airports. 

The report revealed that 350,000 people arrived unnoticed because of glaring gaps in the survey relied on by the Office for National Statistics for migration estimates.

Those counting migrants into the country went to Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester during the crucial years of large-scale immigration from Eastern Europe, while only a handful attended other major airports such as Luton and Stansted, where hundreds of thousands of migrants were arriving.

In addition, immigrants on many ferry routes were barely or never checked, tens of thousands of children were missed entirely and warning signs from other statistics were ignored, the report adds.

The ONS confession comes almost 12 months after the discrepancies first emerged – and follows years of scepticism over the accuracy of its International Passenger Survey, which is based on interviews with people passing through air and sea ports.

The ONS said that most of the unchecked immigrants arrived in the four years after Poland and seven other Eastern European countries entered the EU in April 2004, when Britain was one of just three European countries to allow them in to take jobs.
