A pit bull rehabilitated after being used as a top fighter in the dog-fighting ring bankrolled by quarterback Michael Vick has died.

Officials at the Best Friends Animal Society say Lucas was euthanized Wednesday because of accumulating health problems.

Nearly two dozen of the Vick dogs were rehabilitated at Best Friends in Kanab, Utah. Lucas was one of two not allowed to be adopted because of his history as a fighter.

Pit bull Lucas, once one of Michael Vick's best fighting dogs has been euthanized after accumulating health problems

Lucas, who bears scars from fighting, was described as 'a blessing to be around' by staff at the sanctuary where he lived

So, he spent most of his time lounging in the administrative offices at Best Friends, where he was widely known as one of the friendliest dogs at the sanctuary.

Gregory Castle, the CEO at Best Friends, says it was 'a blessing in every way to be around him and to witness the wonderful effects on everyone he met.'

In April 2007, Vick then of the Atlanta Falcons was implicated in an illegal interstate dog fighting ring that had operated for five years. He pleaded guilty to federal felony charges and served 21 months in prison.

According
to court papers in the cases of Vick and his co-defendants, Vick 
bankrolled the Bad Newz (sic) Kennels operation and joined others in killing dogs that didn't 
perform well.

Since his release from prison in 2009, Vick has sought to rehabilitate his reputation both on and off the field

Threats: Michael Vick's book-signing tour has been canceled in March because of threats against him for running a dog-fighting ring

Vick was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2009 after missing two 
seasons while in federal prison.

The four-time
Pro Bowl quarterback has revived his career and rehabilitated his image without the protests and 
anger that followed immediately following his release from prison.

Since
his release from prison in 2009, Vick has worked with The Humane 
Society of the United States to speak out against animal cruelty. He had
made appearances at schools and spoken to students about the dangers of
being involved in dogfighting.

However there will always be staunch animal lovers who will never forgive 
Vick's role in running the dog-fighting ring.

In March he had to cancel aÂ book-signing tour in support of his autobiography 'Finally Free' because of  'credible threats' made against him.

'Despite warnings of planned 
protests, Vick had hoped to continue with the appearances as planned, 
bringing his story of redemption and second chance to major markets,' 
Worthy Publishing, the Christian publisher releasing his book, said in a
statement.

'However, once the reported protests 
escalated into threats of violence against the retailers, Worthy 
Publishing, Vick and his family, decided to cancel the events.'
