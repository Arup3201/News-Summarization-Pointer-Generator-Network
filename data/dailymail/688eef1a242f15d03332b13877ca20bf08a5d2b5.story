A 57-year-old deaf woman heard her baby granddaughter laugh for the very first time with the help of a cochlear implant while cameras rolled on the Today show.

As America watched this morning, Sarah Campbell, of Norristown, Pennsylvania had her implant activated for the first time and, as if on cue, her one-year-old granddaughter giggled with excitement.

It was a monumental moment for Campbell, who has suffered from hearing problems since childhood and had gone completely deaf in the last five years.

Grandmother: 57-year-old Sarah Campbell of Norristown, Pennsylvania got a cochlear implant three weeks ago and it was turned on for the first time on the Today show

Miracle: As if on cue, Campbell's granddaughter giggled just as the implant activated, which was the first time she ever heard the one-year-old laugh

‘I'm hearing her! Woo! Baby! She was laughing, I think,’ Campbell told her audiologist Michelle Montes as host Matt Lauer stood by with Campbell’s family on Today.

Though Campbell correctly identified her granddaughter’s laughter, there was no way to know if the implant would work as cameras rolled.

‘It's noise ... noise,’ is how Campbell described the sounds at first.

Then, Montes turned the volume up on her implant.

Questions: Cameras were rolling, but as Campbell waited for her implant to activate, she didn't know how well, if at all, it would work

Success: Thankfully, as Today host Matt Lauer and her whole family watched, the implant worked and Campbell heard her granddaughter's giggle

‘I'm hearing you. It's very low. I'm even hearing me! I'm hearing me talk,’ said the thrilled Campbell.

Before getting the implant, life had become a lot less exciting for Campbell.

Ever since childhood, she’d had hearing problems. Hearing aids helped her get by in school and even allowed her to become a special education teacher.

However, as her hearing become fainter over the last few year, it became harder to work and to interact with other people.

Fortunate: Miraculously, her granddaughter's laughter was one of the first things Campbell heard

‘So, I zone out,’ she said. ‘And go into my own little world.’

In that world, Campbell loved to enjoy nature and watch the birds in her back yard. Though, she could never hear any of it.

‘You know, the creaks in your house, the baby crying,’ Campbell said before the implant was activated. ‘Different sounds that you take for granted, and I've never heard 'em.’

And now she has, thanks to the cochlear implant she received three weeks ago at the University of Pennsylvania.

High-tech: Campbell wore hearing aids for years, but they'd stopped working in recent years. Advanced cochlear implants, pictured, are implanted within the ear itself, with a microphone-like device worn outside the head

The microphone and processor worn on the outside are connected to implements that stimulate the bones inside the ear

The implant is made up of a receiver and stimulator implanted on the bones inside the inner ear. They connect to a magnetic transmitter work on the outside of the head which acts as a microphone.

As the audiologist turned on the implant, she explained that the technology will continue to improve, even in the minutes following the activation.

How good her hearing will become remains unknown, but Campbell will be happy just hearing the birds in her yard.

‘Do I expect miracles? No,’ she told Today. ‘I just want to hear better.’

Small wonder? Campbell says she doesn't expect miracles, she just wants to hear things like the birds and the wind in her back yard and more laughter from her granddaughter

Experts weren't sure how well or quickly the implant would work
