Mother-of-four Christina Chinnock competing in and winning her first ever bodybuilding competition

A female barrister has been dubbed 'the strong arm of the law' after winning a national bodybuilding competition.

Mother-of-four Christina Chinnock, from Swansea, south Wales, spends her days in a wig and gown but at night changes into a sparkly bikini and has just won her first competition after less than a year of training.

Mrs Chinnock says she is showing what can be achieved while juggling a demanding job and a growing family.

She said: 'It was the first bodybuilding contest I have ever taken part in so it was a huge personal achievement for me.

'I'm still a practising barrister and I'm a busy mum of four, so that adds to the sense of victory.

'I'm flying the flag for the working mums and showing what we can achieve.'

The hard work she puts in at the gym 
has clearly paid off as she has just scooped the top prize at the 
British Natural Bodybuilding Federation Welsh Championships.

Despite only starting to train properly in October last year she came first in the over forties women's class at the Miss Figure Masters section of the event.

And
although it might not be the most normal of hobbies Mrs Chinnock's four
children Rhys, 20, Rhian, 18, Dylan, nine, and Leona, five, are all 
extremely proud of her achievement.

Mrs
Chinnock was called to the Bar in 1998 and is a member of Angel 
Chambers in Swansea but despite her professional success says she has always been 
'interested' in fitness.

By day she is a successful family law barrister specialising in child law, adoption and child abduction cases.

But far from being a problem in her busy schedule she says her intense workouts have actually helped keep her sane.

She added: 'I have always been interested in fitness, it's not an off the cuff thing.

'But I have only been seriously training since about October last year.

Lady of the law: Christina scooped the top prize after training for less than a year

'I set myself the challenge and decided to enter the championships.

'If you have a busy lifestyle, it gives you that challenge and a personal sense of achievement.

'It has kept me sane mentally and physically to deal with all the other elements of my busy life.'

But
her relaxed attitude belies the strict regimen she follows as she 
admits she has to be extremely careful about what she eats.

Juggling: Christina finds, despite the challenge, her intense workouts actually help her to balance the pressures of being a top lawyer and a mother

She added: 'The important thing in 
this is the diet - it has to be very strict. It's chicken, fish, cottage
cheese and all the healthy options.'

For her, she explains it is important to be feminine as well as strong and so follows a natural workout routine to avoid the pitfalls of the stereotypical female bodybuilders.

Her average workout regime is resistance weight training with some low intensity cardio work to burn fat.

A spokesman for Angel chambers said: 'We joke that Christina is the strong arm of the law - but we are very proud of all her achievements.'
