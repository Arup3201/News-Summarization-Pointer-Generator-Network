His leading role on the Great British Break Bake Off sees him beamed into millions of homes on a weekly basis.

But even the most devoted of Paul Hollywood’s fans might find the sight of him a little overbearing if he ends up as the face of a line of underwear.

For the 47-year-old has applied to trademark his name for an array of products, including baseball hats, travel mugs – even underwear – as he attempts to join the celebrity chef elite. 

Joining the celebrity chef elite: Paul Hollywood has applied to trademark his name on a variety of products including cooking equipment and underwear

Despite his high-profile split with his wife Alexandra earlier this year, the application lodged last month suggests Hollywood is seeking to take advantage of his television profile. The trademark was made through his company Paul Hollywood Limited.

Hollywood has already sought to capitalise on the popularity of the BBC2 programme and was given a spin-off, Paul Hollywood’s Bread, by the corporation.

His personal website was also relaunched last week, selling his two cookery books, How To Bake and the accompanying book to his BBC2 show.

If the application is successful his 
name will be protected should he wish to use it on freezers and kettles.
 A range of clothing is covered by the application, including waistcoats
 and footwear.

Hollywood has sought trademark protection under nine classes, including fan clubs, barbecues and computer programs.

Ancient Hume Limited, a brand protection company which represents Mr Hollywood, and Yellow Poppy, his agency, did not comment.

In a high-profile split, the celebrity baker left his wife of 15 years in March and was later rumoured to have started a relationship with  his 35-year-old co-host Marcela Valladolid on the American version of the bakery competition.

Hollywood’s estranged wife Alexandra later revealed that she is divorcing him on the grounds of his adultery, which he is not contesting.

She said: ‘I felt very secure with Paul. I trusted him completely. I loved him and he loved me. We were happy and life was good.

‘I love my husband and I was and still am very proud of what he has achieved, but there is no going back and I just want this finished with and to move on.

‘I don’t know if he still loves me. You can’t share 15 years of marriage and not have anything left, but right now I just don’t know. ‘

The celebrity baker has spoken out since the breakdown of his marriage, but said he wants to keep his personal life private for the sake of his 11-year-old son.

He said: ‘I’m upset and sad about the whole separation. I’ve been totally honest with those in the know. Everyone else? That’s their problem, I don’t care.’
