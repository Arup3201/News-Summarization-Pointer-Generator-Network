Sometimes moving is just too much effort.

A sleepy baby panda at a Chinese panda sanctuary in Sichuan Province appears to be looking for some affection from its keeper as it sits in a tree, refusing to move.

Despite the best attempts of the breeder to coax the animal down, the panda refuses to move, instead staying stock still, lying across a branch. 

Nap time: Sleepy baby panda does not want to leave its tree

Reluctant to be woken, the dangling panda takes a lot of stirring to awaken it from its nap and even then doesn't seem in any hurry to clamber down.

The breeder strokes the panda awake and tries to encourage it down from the tree at the sanctuary in Sichuan Province, which is popular with tourists wanting to get up close to the endangered animals. 

The baby bear eventually moves, but needs some help to plan its route down.

Although it would be able to climb down the tree itself, the panda stretches out its furry paws to the sanctuary worker, as if asking for a hug. 

Unable to resist, the breeder allows the panda to wrap its arms round his neck. 

Clearly the panda's cheeky tactic is successful as it is carried down from the tree.

The Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries in China are home to more than 30 per cent of the world's highly endangered giant pandas. 

They play a vital role in panda breeding to sustain numbers. 

The Sichuan Province sanctuaries cover 9245 km² with seven nature reserves and nine scenic parks in the Qionglai and Jiajin Mountains. 

Along with the giant panda, the sanctuary is a refuge to other endangered species such as the red panda, the snow leopard, and the clouded leopard among the 109 species of mammals recorded (more than 20 per cent of all Chinese mammals).
