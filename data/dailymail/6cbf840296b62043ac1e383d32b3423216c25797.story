A schizophrenic stabbed his girlfriend to death in front of two police officers and then blamed it on the BBC, a court heard today.

Larry Parker, 54, repeatedly plunged an 18-inch kitchen knife into his long-term partner Lesley Larner after she tried to get medical help for him over the phone.

The Old Bailey heard that police officers who arrived at the scene found Ms Larner, 58, covered in blood after suffering numerous stab wounds.

Police were called to Sherwood Road, in west Ealing, where they found Ms Larner who had been stabbed by her long-term partner Larry Parker

They tried to stop Parker’s continuing onslaught using CS gas, but could do nothing to prevent him from delivering a fatal blow to her chest.

After they managed to drag him away from his victim, he turned to the officers and said: 'It’s the BBC’s fault, it’s the BBC.'

Parker, of West Ealing in west London, was yesterday given a hospital order after previously pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

The attack, which took place on the night of March 13 last year, began after Ms Larner woke up and found Parker on the floor.

A man called 999 but eventually Ms Larner took the phone and explained that her boyfriend had been taking medication for Hepatitis C.

The court heard that he could be heard in the background saying he did not want paramedics to attend.

After midnight, neighbours were woken by what they described as fighting and a woman’s screams.They saw the defendant looking out from a window frame holding a large black kitchen knife.

Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow told the court: 'The defendant looked up and said "call an ambulance, someone has died here".'

In a further 999 call from the property the victim pleaded for help, telling the operator: 'Hurry up, I can’t breathe. I’m going to die.'

When police officers arrived on the scene they told Parker to drop the knife, but after getting no response decided to use CS gas.

'This had no effect upon him and without warning the defendant rushed back into the kitchen from where he had come,' Mr Glasgow told the court.

'The officers were powerless to stop him as he plunged the knife into the victim’s neck.'

Ms Larner suffered a total of 17 stab wounds all over her body of 9cm to 10cm in depth.

The fatal blow went through the left side of her chest, her left lung and the thoracic aorta.

Asked afterwards by officers at Acton police station why he had carried out the attack, Parker said: 'I just lost the plot, I don’t know what it was.'

The court heard that he had a previous conviction for GBH with intent after attacking a man with a knife in 1990, in addition to other violent and drug-related offences.

At the time of the attack he was suffering an 'acute psychotic episode' and had been smoking cannabis, the court heard.

He has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression and had previously reported hearing voices in his head.

Setencing him to remain in hospital until experts determine he has made a full recovery, judge Timothy Pontius said: 'It is undoubtedly necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm at your hands that such an order should be made.'
