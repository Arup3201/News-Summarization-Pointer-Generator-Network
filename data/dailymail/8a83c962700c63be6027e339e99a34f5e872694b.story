The New Jersey teen who moved out of her parents' home and then sued them for child support and college costs, has reached an agreement with her ex-boyfriend to both dismiss restraining orders against each other following a domestic violence incident last month.

Rachel Canning,18, from Lincoln Park, had accused boyfriend Lucas Kitzmiller of choking her with his hands during a fight in the early hours of Sunday July 20.

Kitzmiller was the main source of conflict between Canning and her parents - who did not approve of the relationship - resulting in her moving out and filing a lawsuit against them that hit internationally headlines.

Now, Canning and Kitzmiller have mutually decided to drop their pending domestic violence restrainging orders, according to The Daily Record.

Troubled: Rachel Canning, pictured in court in March, was granted a temporary restraining order against her boyfriend - the same man her parents had been trying to get her to stop seeing - but has now agreed to drop the order

While it is unclear whether the two have reconciled, they appeared in the Family Division of Super Court in Morristown on Monday, and had the orders dropped.

'Canning and Kitzmiller independently reached the conclusion that they should enter their college years without having to worry about the possible consequences of having restraining orders on their respective records and that the actions that led to the filing of the complaints did not rise to the level of domestic violence,' attorney Steven A. Caputo, who represented Kitzmiller, said in a prepared statement to The Daily Record.

'They agreed to the dismissal and confirmed for the court that they were making the decision freely and without coercion or duress. They leave for their respective colleges shortly.'

Last month Canning claimed she ran out of an argument with Katzmiller in Mine Hill and drove off in her car, pulling into the Denville Police Department to make a report.

She said Katzmiller had choked her, according to her father, former Lincoln Park Police Chief Sean Canning.

Then Katzmiller also took out an restraining against Canning, however his side of the story was never revealed in court.

A hearing for whether their final restraining orders was meant to place Wednesday, but both orders were removed on Monday.

The pair got together as students at Morris Catholic High School.

She claimed her parents threw 
her out when she turned 18. But they claimed she voluntarily left their 
Lincoln Park home because she didn't want to abide by their 
household rules, specifically their dislike of Katzmiller.

She moved in with attorney John Inglesino, and in February 
his family filed the suit on her behalf.

Though Canning went to court hoping to shame her parents into paying her child support, she was the one who took the brunt of criticism - both from her parent's lawyers and the judge himself.

'Have you ever in your experience seen such gross disrespect for a parent? I donâ€™t see it in my house,' Family Division Judge Peter Bogaard said at a hearing.

Distraught: Her parents Elizabeth and Sean Canning, pictured in court in March, eventually reconciled with their daughter and she moved back into their New Jersey home but continued to see her boyfriend. The pair have since broken up

Canning eventually reconciled with her parents in March, withdrew the lawsuit and moved back in to their home, where they reported that family life was peaceful.

Her parents told USA Today that they decided not to interfere with their daughter's love life anymore.

Canning graduated this spring and will be attending Western New England University as a biomedical engineering major in the fall on a $56,000 scholarship.

Katzmiller also graduated Morris Catholic High School this past spring.
