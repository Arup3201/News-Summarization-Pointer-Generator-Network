Tory MP David Davis today called for two votes two national votes - one to approve a list of powers for the UK to seek to seize back and then an in-out poll once they had been negotiated

David Cameron has made a series of phone calls to other EU leaders ahead of crunch talks this week aimed at preventing Brussels budget growing even larger.

The Prime Minister is under increasing pressure to secure a freeze in spending from Tory rebels, the Labour party and the voting public.

But he faces an uphill struggle after it emerged EU officials have begun plotting to secure a budget deal without Britain.

The Prime Minister today insisted Brussels had to stop 'picking the pockets' of the public amid reports that EU officials and diplomats are in talks on the legal and financial viability of agreeing a new seven-year budget amongst the 26 member states excluding the UK.

Downing Street said the Prime Minister 'has been hitting the phones this weekend, speaking to several European partners as we continue to work constructively to find a deal on the EU's multi-annual budgetary cycle'.

His spokesman said Mr Cameron had spoken to his counterparts in France, Germany, Holland, Sweden, Denmark and Poland.

Speaking at the CBI conference in London today, Mr Cameron said challenging the EU's spending made him a 'good European'.

'I make absolutely no apologies for standing up strongly for Britain in Europe on some of our priorities,' the PM said.

He said in the UK pay and benefits had been frozen and budgets cut, and Europe had to do the same.

'I
don't think it makes you a bad European because you want a tough budget
settlement in Europe. I think it makes you a good European. I think I 
have got the people of Europe on my side in arguing that we should stop 
picking their pockets and spending more and more money through the EU 
budget, particularly when so many parts of the European budget are not 
well spent.'

The Prime Minister has pledged to 
renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels and then put that deal 
to the public. He is expected to use a speech before Christmas to say 
that would involve a referendum after the next election.

David Cameron told business leaders at the annual Confederation of British Industry conference that tackling Brussels spending made him a 'good European'

But Mr Davis warned that voters would 
not believe him because he reneged on a ‘cast iron’ pledge to hold a 
referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.

‘Nobody believes it and why should 
they?’ he told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show. ‘The British public have 
been promised a referendum by the three major parties, and every single 
one has not delivered. The public feel they’ve been lied to – they won’t
believe any more promises on referendums.’

Mr Davis demanded two referendums: One
to win public backing for a shopping list of areas where Britain wants 
to renegotiate, the other to either approve the deal that is thrashed 
out or to leave the EU.

And he insisted Mr Cameron pass legislation before the next election to ‘put this in law’.

Mr Davis, said: ‘There’s going to be a referendum, 
whoever’s in power in the next five years, because the British public 
will demand it – they won’t put up with it anymore.’

He added today that he was prepared to bet ‘a large sum of money’ on the UK being out of the EU within a decade if the government was unable to secure major changes on the relationship with Brussels.

In a speech at London's St Stephen's Club, the former home secretary called for all justice and home powers to be repatriated permanently along with control over immigration and employment legislation.

The Prime Minister is under fire on several fronts over Europe last night, facing waves of criticism from Tory 
rebels, Ed Miliband and voters over his approach to Brussels.

CBI President Sir Roger Carr added to
the pressure today, with a warning that calls for withdrawal from the 
EU risk 'isolation' which put trade deals in danger.

Speaking
at the opening of the CBI annual conference, Sir Roger said: 'Whatever 
the popular appeal may be of withdrawal, businessmen and politicians 
must keep a bridge firmly in place.

Call for reform: Ed Miliband said eurosceptics are right on many issues, including the European Union budget, immigration and state aid

Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron should be concentrating on 'building alliances' to secure reforms in the EU

'As countries of Europe bind together in pursuit of salvation, we in the UK must work harder to avoid the risks of isolation.'

As
Mr Cameron prepares to 
attend crunch talks on the EU budget this week, it was reported that EU 
officials are trying to strike a deal without Britain which could see 
the Brussels budget rise.

‘People are looking, both in national
capitals and in Brussels, for a solution at 26,’ an official told the 
Financial Times. ‘It is being looked at from a financial and legal point
of view.’

Mr Cameron has said he is willing to veto any budget deal which he thinks is not in Britain's interest.

But Ken Clarke, the Europhile minister without portfolio, warned the stance would mean the EU ignored the EU entirely.

'If
you turn up saying ‘we’re not going to agree to anything come what 
may’, which the hard-line people would love him to say, all that happens
is they’ll take no notice of us,' he told BBC Radio 4.

Without
agreement on a seven-year deal, the EU would proceed on year-by-year 
budgets which would cost even more, Mr Clarke added.

'What
we’re proposing is a freeze for seven years. That’s much tougher than 
anything we’ve suggested so far for British public spending. And that’s a
good starting point. It gives us a position in negotiations.'

Business Secretary Vince Cable backed the PM the Prime Minister to argue the UK's case for a real-terms freeze in the EU budget in a 'forceful way'

Mr Cameron is under pressure to hold to a freeze, after 53 Tory rebels backed a Commons motion last month calling for a real-terms cut in EU spending.

Mr Davis, a leading right-winger, warned that the public believes Mr Cameron has lied to them 
about the prospects of a referendum.

He spoke out as a new poll showed that the public overwhelmingly wants him to take a much tougher line with Brussels.

And in another assault, Labour leader 
Mr Miliband will call for sweeping reforms of the EU budget in an 
attempt to win over eurosceptic voters.

Mr Cameron is preparing to demand the 
EU budget rises by no more than inflation when he attends a summit this 
week, defying his MPs who want to see the budget cut in cash terms.

But in a blow to Mr Cameron’s credibility, a ComRes poll found that 66 per cent of voters want the budget cut.

The PM has said he thinks the UK 
should stay part of the European Union. But the poll found that 58 per 
cent think Britain should withdraw if powers cannot be restored to 
Westminster – a view that is shared by at least ten members of the 
Cabinet.

Some 43 per cent want to pull out of 
the EU regardless and one in four Tory voters is considering voting for 
the UK Independence Party which advocates withdrawal.

Mr Cameron will 
come under further pressure today when Boris Johnson says he must veto 
the ‘amazing’ demands of the European Commission for a 5 per cent rise 
in spending.

To make matters worse for Mr Cameron, 
he is now facing a Labour leader keen to convince voters that his party 
is no longer an uncritical admirer of Brussels.

Ed Miliband used a speech today to
call for reforms to how EU money is spent. He said: ‘For more than 
three decades our membership of the European Union has seemed to be a 
settled question. Not any more.’

He argued Mr Cameron is the wrong 
man to reform Brussels because the growing euroscepticism of the Tory 
party has made it impossible for him to build alliances with other EU 
countries.

‘Many of our traditional allies in 
Europe clearly think that Britain is heading to the exit door,’ he said. ‘I will not allow our country to sleepwalk toward exit because it 
would be a betrayal of our national interest.

‘We cannot afford to use up our energies and alliances on negotiations that will not deliver.’

A Tory source said: ‘Ed Miliband and the Labour Party have zero credibility on negotiating in Europe.

‘They gave up half our rebate and got 
nothing in return, and approved inflation-busting increases in European 
spending at every opportunity.’

Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said Mr Cameron was right to argue the UK's case for a real-terms freeze in the EU budget in a 'forceful way'.

He said: 'The budget proposals are unacceptable. I support the hard line, but that does not mean I am anti-Europe - quite the opposite.'
