The Ryder Cup at Gleneagles is expected to be another fiercely contested battle between Europe and the United States, but the first point may just have been scored by the American team. In the fashion competition, that is.

That point will not count towards the holy grail of 14-and-a-half points needed by the winning team in Perthshire, but if the US are unable to arrest an alarming record of five defeats in the last six Ryder Cups, then at least they will look good while losing.

Ralph Lauren have unveiled the US team's playing uniforms for all three days at Gleneagles, where Europe will attempt to retain the trophy between 26-28 September. And very smart they are too.

Clothes show: (left-right) Friday, Saturday and Sunday's designs for the American Ryder Cup team

The three outfits feature the all-American colours of red, white and blue. Friday's ensemble is a white polo shirt with blue trousers featuring white stripes. Saturday's design features a blue polo with white piping and gives a nod to this year's Ryder Cup hosts thanks to navy and green tartan slacks. Sunday's polo has a block-blue upper third with the rest taken up by white and blue hoops, accompanied by bold red trousers.

Europe's team uniforms are yet to be revealed. 

Tiger Woods will not be seen sporting the gear having pulled out of the event with back problems, but plenty of other big names will be kitted out. 

Following captain Tom Watson's wildcard announcement on Tuesday, the full American team who will play in Perthshire will be: Keegan Bradley, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Hunter Mahan, Matt Kuchar, Phil Mickelson, Patrick Reed, Webb Simpson, Jordan Spieth, Jimmy Walker and Bubba Watson.

Those lucky 12 can, according to a statement, 'draw on the rich history and sophistication of the Ryder Cup.' Although anyone who has seen some of the crimes against fashion worn in past Ryder Cups (most notably at Brookline in 1999) might question that statement.

It continues: 'Ralph Lauren presents a patriotic collection of commemorative apparel and official team uniforms to be worn by the US Ryder Cup team.

'Embodying the spirit of the US Ryder Cup team, iconic stars and stripes, graphic color-blocking and a classic palette of red, white and blue define the official on-course looks.'

The patriotic overtones are clear to see, but fancy clothes alone will not be enough to overcome Paul McGinley, Rory McIlroy and Co later this month.
