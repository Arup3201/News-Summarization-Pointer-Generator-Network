Punishment: Stalkers now face up to five years in jail

Stalking yesterday became a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.

Two new offences aim to close a gap in the law that has allowed those who target, follow and threaten others to escape arrest or punishment.

Under a new law, those who harass others by following or spying on them can be jailed for up to six months.

A second new offence means those who cause their target to fear violence or make them change the way they live can be imprisoned for up to five years.

Home Secretary Theresa May said that stalking is a ‘sickening and cowardly’ crime.

‘One in six women has been a victim of stalking,’ she added.

‘Too many women live in fear, forced to look constantly over their shoulder. We need to end their suffering.

Earlier criminal law, including harassment offences largely introduced under the last Labour government, covered tactics used by stalkers but left it possible for stalkers to target victims without committing an offence.

The Home Office said that ‘adding specific offences of stalking will provide greater clarity around this offence for the police and others looking to improve the safety of victims and bring perpetrators to justice.’

Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne said: 'This is a very serious problem which affects thousands of thousands of mainly women, not exclusively women, but mainly women, right across the country.

'It is the sort of offence that people can sometimes brush under the carpet, not be aware of, it has been trivialised sometimes in the past as something which is just people, mainly women, being a bit bothered but nothing to worry about too much,' he told BBC Breakfast.

'We are saying it is a serious offence, it is a specific offence, we want people to be aware of it.'

The new offences bring English law into line with Scotland where stalking has been an offence in itself for two years.

An inquiry by MPs earlier this year estimated that 120,000 people are stalked each year but in fewer than half of these cases do police record that a crime has been committed.

A stalker is jailed over one in 50 of these incidents, their report said.

Theresa May spoke of Rana Qruqui who was stalked by her boyfriend who stabbed her to death

Stalking cases have been highlighted by a number of incidents that have ended in murder. In one 49-year-old Clifford Mills stalked his former girlfriend Lorna Smith on Facebook before stabbing her to death at his flat in Brixton, south London, in February last year.

Mills was jailed in February for life, with a minimum term of 21 years, after being found guilty of murder.

Mrs May spoke yesterday of the case of Rana Faruqui, a 35-year-old business analyst and prominent horsewoman who was stalked by a former boyfriend. Stephen Griffiths followed and spied on her, and cut the brake pipes of her car.

Thames Valley police took no action, until Miss Faruqui was stabbed to death in a field in 2003. Griffiths was later sentenced to life for murder, and Miss Faruqui’s mother Carol became a campaigner for tougher laws on stalking.

The Home Secretary said yesterday: ‘Carol was determined to campaign for the victims of stalking and talking to her made me realise the full horror of stalking. I am determined to do all I can to stop more women suffering Rana’s fate. Sadly her case is not a one-off.’

The new laws, introduced under the wide-ranging Protection of Freedoms Act, came into force yesterday.
