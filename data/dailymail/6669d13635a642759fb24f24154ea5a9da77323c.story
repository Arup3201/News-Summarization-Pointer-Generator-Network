One of South Africa's most notorious apartheid murderers, known as 'Prime Evil', has been granted parole  after 20 years in jail.

Eugene De Kock carried out a reign of terror in which he committed more than 100 acts of murder, torture and fraud as head of the infamous Vlakplaas police death squad which targeted anti-apartheid activists.  

The highly decorated former colonel was sentenced to two life terms plus 212 years in prison for his crimes, including the 1982 bombing of the ANC's London offices.

Euguene De Kock has been granted parole after serving 20 years in prison for a string of apartheid-era crimes

South Africa's Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha told a news briefing today: 'In the interest of nation-building and reconciliation I have decided to place Mr De Kock on parole.'  

De Kock admitted his vile past to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, established in 1995 to consider amnesty for those who confessed their crimes during apartheid. 

 The run-up to the parole decision rekindled bitter debate over the crimes of the former white-minority regime.

To some his crimes of multiple murder, kidnapping and torture were too heinous for forgiveness.

To others, the former police officer was a symbolic and repentant prisoner serving time as a scapegoat for countless perpetrators of apartheid evil who were never punished.

It is a point De Kock made in his court appeal against last year's parole denial.

'I am the only member of the South African Police Service that is serving a sentence for crimes which I had committed, as part of the National Party's attempt to uphold apartheid and fight the liberation movements.

'Not one of the previous generals, or ministers who were in cabinet up to 1990 have been prosecuted at all,' he wrote.

He has apparently been a model prisoner, engaging with the families of his victims and cooperating with the government in locating the dumped bodies of those he killed.

De Kock has made confessions before tribunals, written letters begging forgiveness and named top officials who gave him orders.

He has been eligible for parole consideration for more than seven years, but his second bid for release was denied in July, against the recommendation of the parole board.
