A heartbroken mother has relived the horrific moment she dragged her 21 month old son out of the family washing machine before he later died in her arms.

Ollie Hebb was helping mother Tiffany on laundry day, climbing atop a bin so he could toss clothes into a top-loading washer.

Mrs Hebb sat down to read a magazine, but then noticed Ollie was missing. 'I walked around through my whole house calling his name and couldn’t find him anywhere,' she told KSL-TV.

'And then I put my hands in the washer and felt his little body. The worst day of my life.'

Tragic: Ollie Hebb died before his second birthday when he became stuck in the family washing machine

Grief: Tiffany Hebb, pictured with her brother, made the appalling discovery at her home on March 23

She told the Deseret News: 'I couldn’t get him out of the washer; he was stuck.

'So I pulled his head above the water, and he had no heartbeat, no pulse. He wasn’t breathing.'

After getting help from a neighbour to pull him out, Ollie’s heart 
restarted nearly an hour later. He was put on life support for 24 hours 
before the family decided to let him go on March 24.

'We just held him, cuddling him for his last moments of life,' Hebb told
the paper. 'Six hours later, he took his last breath and passed away'.

His mother, recently moved to Oregon from Utah, says she never thought the washing machine would be a danger to her child and is telling her story to make parents aware of the danger.

The Consumer Products Safety Commission, a federal agency, says such deaths are rare — two children under the age of five died in washing machines between 2005 and 2009, according to a recent report.

Tiffany and Chris Hebb will probably not face charges, according Michael Rouches, spokesman for police in Hillsboro, Oregon.

'Detectives don't believe that this was an intentional crime or that anyone stuck the baby in the washer,' Mr Roushes said on Monday.

'We have the DA's office look into it, just to make sure there wasn't a degree of negligence.'

Mr Rouches said detectives couldn't find other cases when toddlers drowned under similar circumstances.

'She was 30 feet away in the living room, reading a magazine,' he said. 'It wasn't like the mother had this kid unattended at the time.'

The 2011 report says two children under the age of 5 died in washing machines between 2005 and 2009.

During that time, 350 children died in bathtubs, and 77 drowned in something else, such as a decorative water feature, a cooler or a septic tank.

Danger: Ollie's parents are using his death as a chance to remind others of the perils of household appliances

Ollie when his parents decided to take him off life support after 24 hours. His organs were donated, to give other children a chance of life.

The couple had recently moved from Orem, Utah to the Portland suburb where Mr Hebb had found a job. The boy was buried over the weekend in Utah.

'Every night when I go to sleep, I start feeling sick,' Mr Hebb told the Deseret News.

'Every time I wake up, I think this is a nightmare and then realise it's real. You hear a baby crying in the night from a neighbour's house. You wake up, hoping it's your little boy, and then realise he's not there.'
