Non-partisan voter mobilization group Rock the Vote dropped a star-studded parody of Lil Jon's summer hit Turn Down For What on Monday as part of a campaign to get young people to the polls next month.

Playing a version of himself, Lil Jon goes to his area polling place to cast his vote, only to run into Girls' star Lena Dunham and celebrity trainer Tracy Andersen, voting together in the same booth.

The theme of the video is Turn Out For What, a play on Lil Jon's own song, and the video features the rapper and other celebrities, including Saturday Night Live alum Fred Armison and Orange is the New Black's Natasha Lyonne, who are reportedly an item.

'Turn Out For What?': In Rock the Vote's latest PSA rapper Lil Jon turns his summer hit Turn Down For What into a voting anthem

Lyonne states that she's voting because she'd like to see criminal justice reform, and, Lil Jon shares, unsurprisingly, that he's in favor of marijuana legalization.

'Hi, I'm Fred, and I'm turning out because I want to impress my friends,' 47-year-old Armisen says. 'That's the only reason to ever do anything.'

At one point in the video Dunham gets her dance on, sans pants.

Not to be missed is Lil Jon's phone call with his 'aunt' Whoopi Goldberg at the beginning of the three and a half minute long public service announcement. 

In a throwback to his memorable appearance on Dave Chappelle's show for a 'Moment in the Life of Lil Jon' nearly a decade ago, Goldberg repeatedly tells her nephew that she can't hear him. He hangs up the phone after a few moments to go vote in the midterm elections.

He also bumps into Girls' star Lena Dunham and celebrity fitness trainer Tracy Anderson

There he meets a Lil Jon wannabee who goes by the name Lil' Ben, and, of course, looks absolutely nothing like the 43-year-old musical artist.

'Wow. Mr. Jon. I'm a big fan. I saw you perform last week in 'da club,' Lil' Ben, a young, white poll worker tells him. 'This is pretty, pretty crunk.

'Sometimes people think we kind of look alike, I don't know if it's the glasses...'

A bewildered looking Lil Jon interrupts the nerdy-looking volunteer to get his ballot, and is promptly instructed that 'there are voting booths from the windows over to the walls' that he can 'rock the vote' in - another pun on Lil Jon's music.

'Skeet, skeet, skeet,' the poll worker hollers after his idol.

At one point in the video a pantless-Lena Dunham gets her groove on

Rock the Vote, while categorically nonprofit, often features celebrities in its videos who are openly supportive of Democrats, including Dunham, who infamously cut an ad for Barack Obama during the 2012 presidential election about her 'first time' - voting, that is.

Glee star Darren Criss, who appears in the Turn Out for What video as well as a 2012 PSA about the history of voting sponsored by the organization, headlined a fundraiser for Obama's reelection campaign two years ago. He again performed for Obama during his second inauguration, along with Glee co-stars Naya Rivera and Amber Riley.

As such, the actors and actresses in Rock the Vote's most recent PSA say they are turning out to vote for historically liberal policy proposals such as 'global warming awareness' and 'reproductive rights.'  

The overall message of the voter mobilization group's most recent video is for young people to turn out to vote for the issues that important to them, whatever they are, though.

The midterm elections will take place on Tuesday, Nov. 4. Every state must decide who they want to to do their bidding in the House of Representatives, while 36 states will have the opportunity to select new senators and governors.
