Olivier Sarkozy has turned his political attention to American campaigns as he is hosting a fundraiser supporting Massachusetts congressman Joseph Kennedy.

Sarkozy, who is the half-brother of former French Prime Minister Nicholas, lives in New York and is dating Mary Kate Olsen.

It is unclear why the 44-year-old banker is interested in a Congressional race in Massachusetts, hinting that he may be trying to make inroads with another famous political family.

Famous families: Sarkozy is the brother of the former French prime minister and Kennedy is the grandson of former Attorney General Robert Kennedy

Congressman Kennedy is the only member of the former president's extended family serving in Washington at the moment.

The New York Post reports that Sarkozy- who has dual American and French citizenship- sent an email inviting guests to his home for a fundraiser on October 7.

'I believe Joe is the kind of new leader we need in Washington,' he wrote in the email.

'He is pragmatic, principled, and willing to look past party labels in the interest of getting things done . . . he brings fresh energy and much-needed perspective to our long-term economic and social challenges.'

Republican ties: The only other political donations Sarkozy has made have been to Senators Mitch McConnell (left) and John Cornyn (right), both of whom are Republicans and neither of whom represent Sarkozy's home state of New York

It is unclear how many guests have 
been invited, but each has been encouraged to contribute between $1,000 
to $5,200 to attend and be named as a co-chair.

This
is not the first time that Sarkozy has donated to American political 
campaigns, but it is the first time in recent years that he has contributed to a 
Democratic candidate.

According to the Center for Responsive
Politics, Sarkozy has donated to both Senator Mitch McConnell of 
Kentucky and Senator John Cornyn of Texas.

Both donations were for $1,300 a piece and they were made on June 13 of this year.

New York Magazine reported that in 2004 during his marriage to his now-ex-wife Charlotte, the couple donated $5,000 to the John Kerry presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

'They were really the first political couple in France. They were always compared to the Kennedys,' showing another interesting overlap to the dinner fundraiser for Joseph.

Together: Sarkozy, 44, is dating the 27-year-old actress and fashion designer and the house in New York's East Village that they bought together is now on the market

Kennedy,
32, assumed office just nine months ago but because of Congress' 
two-term cycle, apparently the October 7 fundraiser is already needed.

When he came to office in January, his family name returned to the Capitol as his cousin Patrick's retirement from Congress in 2011 was the first time since 1947 that there was no Kennedy holding elected office.

Now his solo stretch is coming to an end, as his second cousin Caroline, the daughter of JFK and Jackie, is in the process of being approved as the new American Ambassador to Japan.
