One in seven pregnant women in Ebola-hit West African countries could die in childbirth because hospitals are overwhelmed and unable to treat them, leading aid charities warned this morning.

The rate of women dying while giving birth in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia is soaring due to inadequate medical facilities and a fear of contact with bodily fluids preventing people helping them.

The United Nations Population Fund estimates that 800,000 women in those three countries alone over the coming 12 months - with aid charities warning that some 120,000 of them could face life-threatening complications if there are not dramatic improvements in emergency care.

Outbreak: The world's worst Ebola epidemic, which emerged  in March, has infected more than 13,000 people and killed almost 5,000 in the three worst-hit countries - Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia

Threat: One in seven pregnant women in Ebola-hit West African countries could die in childbirth because hospitals are overwhelmed and unable to treat them, leading aid charities have warned 

Tens of thousands of women could die in childbirth in West Africa over the coming year due to medical facilities being overwhelmed by the Ebola crisis, according to the DEC group of 13 leading UK charities, including Save The Children and ActionAid.

Korto Williams, head of ActionAid in Liberia, said many women were being left to give birth alone because stigma and a lack of information meant midwives feared catching Ebola and stayed away.

Too many women have died because of lack of care, she said, adding video clips on the internet show women giving birth in the streets of Monrovia with no one helping.

She said the 'horrendous prediction' of one in seven women dying in childbirth was a 'worst case scenario' but added: 'We have to do more to ... stop this coming true.'

'We have to ensure that pregnant women get the care they urgently need or we will see the rate of maternal deaths skyrocket,' Ms Williams added.

Spread: Global health specialists have warned that with clinics overwhelmed with thousands of Ebola cases, West Africans with other diseases like malaria or tuberculosis are also likely to suffer

The world's worst Ebola epidemic, which emerged in Guinea in March, has infected more than 13,000 people and killed almost 5,000 in the three worst-hit countries.

Global health specialists have warned that with clinics overwhelmed with thousands of Ebola cases, people with other diseases like malaria or tuberculosis, and those with conditions needing medical care, are likely to suffer.

'Ebola is having a huge impact on wider health issues like maternal healthcare,' said Save the Children's chief executive Justin Forsyth.

'No children have gone to school since March and pregnant mums are avoiding health clinics and hospitals,' he added.

In a joint statement released this morning, the 13 charities said speeding up the creation of more Ebola-focused treatment centres so that other health facilities can function normally would be essential to avoiding the feared rise in maternal deaths.

The group also called for more protective and sanitation equipment to be provided, as well as treatment units specifically for health workers, to enable midwives to work safely and without unnecessary risks.

There have been reports of a drop in the numbers of new Ebola cases in Liberia, but Médecins Sans Frontières is warning against complacency, saying the outbreak is far from over. 

New hotspots are emerging around the country all the time, said MSF and in Guinea, where there were two significant dips in cases, the numbers have risen again. 

The Spanish nurse who survived Ebola said she will demand £120,000 compensation from the government for putting down her dog Excalibur.

Teresa Romero, 44, spent a month in isolation after becoming the first person outside Africa to contract the disease while she was caring for a missionary.

But she said the worst part of her ordeal was leaning her mixed breed dog had been put down, claiming 'he was not given a chance'.

Lawyers for Mrs Romero say the decision to put the animal down last month as she battled the killer disease was 'improvised and taken against medical advice'.

Health chiefs in Madrid obtained a court order to sacrifice Excalibur despite an online petition to save it signed by more than 300,000 people.

Riot police clashed with protestors outside her home near Madrid so they could take the animal away to incinerate it.

As well as demanding compensation for her dog through the courts, the nurse is also planning to sue Madrid health chief Javier Rodriguez for defamation.

While Teresa was battling to save her life he accused her of hiding information from the doctors who treated her before she was admitted to hospital.

He also claimed she could have contracted the Ebola virus by not following protocol.

Amid controversy over the training given to health professionals treating the two Spanish missionaries with the disease he claimed on TV: 'You don't need a Masters degree to explain to someone how to put on or take off a suit.'

He went on to apologise after Teresa and her husband demanded his resignation.
