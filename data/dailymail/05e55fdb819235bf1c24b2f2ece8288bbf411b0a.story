European Union cash is set to be used to fund a ‘holiday camp’ for migrants in Calais in a scheme that was last night condemned as being an ‘encouragement’ for the many thousands desperate to enter the UK illegally.

The new day centre for migrants is being built on a former children’s summer camp, next to Calais port, where hundreds of illegals try to board lorries each day in the hope of stowing away to Britain.

The French government has demanded a £3 million grant from the EU, which would include money that ultimately comes from British taxpayers.

Walk in the park: The former activity centre has slides and football pitches. The 'holiday camp' has been slammed by critics who say it is an encouragement for thousands of migrants 

But critics of the plan have already compared the new centre to the notorious Sangatte camp, which was closed down in 2002 amid claims that it attracted thousands of migrants who wanted to enter Britain illegally.

Michael Ellis, the Tory MP for Northampton North who sits on the influential Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘I think there is a danger that these sorts of facilities will be seen as an encouragement to migrants, whereas the French should be doing everything to disincentivise or discourage migrants from coming to Calais and creating problems for the British and for the town itself.’

The new permanent day centre is spread over about 12 acres of parkland and comes with two football pitches. It has almost a dozen park benches and there is a children’s slide and swings.

French officials say that the new centre will be up and running by the middle of this month or by the beginning of January at the latest. 

It will have kitchens that will serve about 700 meals per day. There will be four halls where up to 400 migrants will be able to sit to stay warm.

There are an estimated 2,500 migrants in Calais, from troubled countries including Eritrea, Sudan and Libya in Africa and the war-torn states of Syria and Afghanistan.

The migrants, many of whom have smartphones, will be able to charge their mobiles at power points, helping them to surf the internet on their devices. The day centre will come with hot showers and toilet facilities, and a nurse to treat minor ailments and injuries.

Critics warned the developments could encourage more people to flock to the area to try to access Europe

It is also believed that there will be an office in the complex which will be manned by officers from the UK Border Force.

They will be there to inform the migrants of the ‘realities’ of entering Britain, in an apparent effort to dissuade them.

Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘I don’t think it’s a good idea. What will be created is a new Sangatte which will be a magnet for different sorts of migrants. 

Lorry-drivers have slammed the French government for building a new night shelter for migrants near the port of Calais. 

The camp - open only when the temperature falls below -5C - will accommodate 2,000 migrants in a converted 4,000sq ft warehouse. 

Driver Bertoni Domenigo, 45, from Brescia, Italy, who caught eight Vietnamese migrants in his lorry last week said: 'For us, the problem will get worse.' 

'People traffickers will advertise this day centre as another reason to come to Calais to go to Britain. This day centre will definitely attract more migrants to Calais.’

French officials have said that the new complex will also contain dozens of cubicles which vulnerable migrants such as women and children will be able to sleep in and use as accommodation.

The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, announced the plans to build the migrant centre in Calais in October, saying it will cost around £4.3 million to run each year.

This weekend the EU revealed that the French government made an application for ‘emergency assistance’ from the EU’s Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) for £3.3 million.

As Britain also pays towards the AMIF, British taxpayers will be part-funding the centre in Calais, when it is granted.

French authorities have also built a camp next to a route used by lorry jumpers stowing away in vehicles 

An EU spokesman said: ‘The assistance will cover basic services (drinking water, showers, toilets, daily meals, electricity, social and legal counselling) in a day centre for irregular immigrants near Calais.’

The remainder of the required £4.3 million will be provided by France’s interior ministry. 

Philippe Mignonet, deputy mayor of Calais, said: ‘We get blamed for doing something, and we get blamed for doing nothing. The new centre will not make Calais more appealing for illegal migrants – the appeal lies in England, in your benefit system and your illegal jobs market.’
