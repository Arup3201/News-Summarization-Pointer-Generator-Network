An adorable video showing ducklings and their families being rescued from a range of precarious situations including manholes and busy roads has gone viral and been viewed more than 65 million times. 

The cute clip called People Being Awesome which lasts three minutes was put up by Animals Australia and is part of a campaign calling for duck shooting to be banned in Victoria in the lead up to the election on November 29. 

It has been viewed nearly 65 million times and been shared an amazing 1.4 million times by people that have loved the video.

Team effort: The cute video has gone viral and been shared more than 1.4 million times

This willing volunteer is helped by two friends down a manhole to try and rescue a duckling 

It takes four people in all to get to one little distressed duckling which had been trapped down the hole 

Lyn White, Campaign Director for Animals Australia, told news.com.au that the response to the video has been 'overwhelming'. 

She added: 'The response to this small video has been extraordinary and reinforces that overwhelmingly people want our native waterbirds to be protected, not shot out of the sky in the name of 'sport',' she said.

'It provides such a powerful indication of what people are seeking and responding to when it comes to human behaviour — people are responding to empathy not apathy — and whichever political party finally recognises this will reap the rewards.'

The first clip in the video shows a man dangling down a manhole as his two friends hold onto his legs and after a few moments they start to pull him up and it shows him retreieving an adorable duckling which scuttles off. 

Animal rights group Animals Australia shows a heart wrenching picture of a duck injured as a result of shooting as part of their campaign and explains that the duck shooting is already banned in Western Australia, NSW and Queensland. 

They say that the Victorian government still 'support the recreational slaughter of native water birds'. 

It says: 'With the state election coming up on November 29, the Victorian Labor Party wants every vote they can get. So and make our wetlands safe for everyone to enjoy.

'With fewer than 0.4% of Victorians actively involved in shooting and more than 75% of Victorians supporting a ban on duck shooting, we've teamed up with RSPCA Victoria and over 50 other groups to send a clear message to Labor on behalf of Victorians: 'Our waterbirds should be safe, not shot.' Will you join us?' 

Animals Australia have compiled a joint letter with RSPCA which has been signed by more than 50 other comservation and welfare groups. 

It calls of all Victorian Labour MPs to ban the shooting of native Australian ducks. 

Worth the effort: The volunteer looks proud as punch when he finally got to the duckling 

The letter states: 'Many ducks aren't killed instantly. Instead they suffer fractured legs, shattered bills, splintered wings, pellets through their eyes and gunshot lodged in vital organs. These wounded birds often face a slow, painful death.' 

So it's no wonder the three minute video, People Being Awesome, posted and compiled by Animals Australia has gone viral with more than 1,410, 000 shares, and 64,186,372 views.

The video, which features a range of people rescuing ducks and opens on a man being held down a manhole to save a duckling, forms part of a new campaign by the animal rights group urging Victorian Labor to change their policy on duck shooting.

Animals Australia said other states including Western Australia, Queensland and NSW have already banned it so it was time Victoria did the same. 

Simply beautiful: This is one of the fluffy little ducklings which was rescued on the video which has gone viral

 Animals Australia have sent a joint letter with the RSPCA, and it has been signed by more than 50 other animal welfare and conservation groups, calling on all Victorian Labor MPs and candidates to ban the 'cruel sport'.

'Duck-shooting is a practice that causes unnecessary suffering to native wildlife and is also opposed by the vast majority of Victorians,' the letter reads.

'The ALP taking a decision that reflects the wishes of most Victorians, rather than a small and declining number of shooters, is not only appropriate but would elicit an overwhelmingly positive response from the Victorian community.'
