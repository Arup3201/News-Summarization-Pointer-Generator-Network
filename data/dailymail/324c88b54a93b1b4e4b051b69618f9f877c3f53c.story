'He lifted up his shirt, pulled the gun out... and immediately pointed at me,' Miss Taylor said to Good Morning America.

'I just freaked out and then he raised the gun and let out a shot to the ceiling.'

She said she was working as an in-store greeter on Sunday when chaos ensued.

Alvarez shouted for the customers to leave the store, which also happened to contain an arsenal of weapons for sale, as was reported by the Appeal-Democrat.

Miss Taylor's manager hid and called 911, letting them know what had happened just before 11 a.m. that day.

'I have a gun shot in the store. I need an officer here now,' the store manager told a 911 operator, according to GMA.

'At Big 5?' the operator asked.

'Yes. I'm hiding under the desk in the office,' they responded.

Hands Up: Miss Taylor's efforts prevailed and she was able to convince Alvarez to put his weapon down and turn himself into police just after 3 p.m.

Alvarez then allegedly pulled Miss Taylor into the office that housed the store's safe and demanded she open it. She told him she didn't know how to and he said he didn't want the money anyway.

He held her there for four hours, never letting her know why.

She took the opportunity to talk with him, establishing a relationship with her captor.

'I knew in my mind that it would be easier for him to shoot me if I didn't look him in the eye or if I didn't talk to him, make a connection with him,' Miss Taylor said to GMA.

She calmed him down, talking to him about his family and his future hopes.

On Call: Alvarez shouted for the customers to leave the store, which also happened to contain an arsenal of weapons for sale. SWAT waited outside

'He didn't want to die that day. He wanted to be able to see his daughter again and so I knew that,' she said, adding that she told him 'As long as you don't hurt me you can see your daughter again. The cops are going to help you.'

Miss Taylor's efforts prevailed and she was able to convince Alvarez to put his weapon down and turn himself into police just after 3 p.m.

'I just started shaking, I could barely walk out of the store,' Miss Taylor said. 'But once I was in the hands of the police officers, I knew at that point I was fine and OK.'

'I knew in my mind that it would be easier
for him to shoot me if I didn't look him in the eye or if I didn't talk
to him, make a connection with him.'

Local law enforcement was in awe of Miss Taylor, saying she acted with exceptional calm and command.

'She knew when to push, she knew when to let him be. You can't help but thank her enough and be in awe of that young girl,' Shawna Pavey, operations support manager of the Yuba City Police Department, said to GMA.

Miss Taylor said that she still loves her job and is looking to get back to work.

A coworker that witnessed the incident also said he was astonished by her life-saving grace.

'Where she was, she was completely vulnerable,' Matt Rasul said to Fox.

'For her to have the strength like that, I can say that's admirable. It's good to know that people like that are still around that are strong.'

'I say god bless Allyson Taylor.'
