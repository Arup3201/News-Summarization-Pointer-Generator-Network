Thousands of people are claiming to experience pleasure from listening to whispers and scratchy noises in a bizarre phenomenon known as ASMR, it has emerged.

Even watching the gentle act of folding towels gives some people a tingle down the spine and a tingle in their scalp.

Known as Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, the idea of it may seem like an April Fool’s day joke.

Pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge wrapping Christmas gifts in New York would have been popular with devotees of Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, the phenomenon of experiencing pleasure from mundane activities such as wrapping presents or folding towels

But its devotees insist it is a real phenomenon, and has spawned a cottage industry, with dozens of video artists creating pleasurable sensations for viewers from a myriad of different sources.

There are ASMR videos of polished fingernails tapping on a plastic surface, of someone wrapping presents, of people being given massages, of performers whispering to camera in Latin.

There are people pretending to be doctors giving the viewer a ‘cranial nerve exam’, and others pretending to cut your hair, pretending to give you a job interview or pretending to be a receptionist at hotel check-in.

There is no scientific evidence to explain ASMR but brain scientists say the hard wiring of some people’s brains mean they get stimulation from quietly satisfying things.

Viewing videos to recreate the sensation provides an extra ‘shot’ of pleasure, it is claimed.

They are astonishingly popular, with 770,000 views over two years notched up so far for an 18 minute video of a woman demonstrating ways to fold towels and napkins.

Among the many who own up to ASMR is BBC science reporter Nick Higham, whose experiences date back decades.

He said ‘When I was a child I sometimes experienced a pleasant physical sensation in my scalp when I was especially intrigued or fascinated by something, or when being touched or stroked in certain ways.

‘The sensation continued into adulthood, but when I tried to explain what I was feeling to other people I was met with baffled looks and a quick change of subject.’

He says the videos can trigger - in a minority of people - a particular sensation in their scalp, best described as a buzzing or tingling that’s warm, relaxing and extremely pleasurable.

One video of a blonde woman with an eastern European accent who calls herself Maria GentleWhispering lasts 16 minutes and has been viewed 7.6 million times

Some fans say they feel calmer after watching an ASMR video, or that it helps with sleeping difficulties.

Francis McGlone, professor of neuroscience at Liverpool John Moores University, has failed to find any research to support a neurobiological basis for why these sensory experiences should be induced by observing ASMR videos.

But he is profoundly sceptical of their use as a kind of home-brewed alternative therapy: “

He said ‘What worries me is susceptible individuals who want to believe this kind of thing because they really have problems and need some kind of psychological help - that is where I get a little bit annoyed, because people can be led up the garden path by techniques that clearly are snake oil, and do not and will not provide any long term benefit for an underlying condition.’

Yale University neuroscientist Steven Novella, who has written about ASMR, says he’s ‘inclined to think it’s a real phenomenon’ not least because so many people report similar experiences.

He said ‘I have never experienced this myself. I listened to the whispering in Latin video, which was eerily intimate at first, and then just a bit weird, although I always love listening to Latin.

‘But I experienced no tingling or euphoria.’

He said ‘It is plausible that a subset of the population has a particular pattern of neural hard wiring so that when they experience certain things that are typically quietly satisfying they get a little extra shot to their pleasure centre.

‘Once they experience this then they seek out greater and greater triggers of this response, and perhaps then a learning or conditioning component kicks in.’

The ASMR Research and Support website, which lists the triggers, seeks volunteers for research who have ASMR experiences – and also those who do not for comparison purposes.
