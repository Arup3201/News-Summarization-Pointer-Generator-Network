Brutal: Two American Bulldogs are seen mauling a 55-year-old New Jersey woman

Help: At one point a passerby tries to restrain on of the dogs by holding onto its back

Retraint: A passerby tried to hold one of the Bulldogs down

Witnesses say the attack lasted for five minutes.

'The lady is screaming, 'Oh my god, they're biting her,' said K'Shawn Scott to NBC New York, who filmed the video with his cell phone.

'The dogs, I could see it in their eyes, something had them angry.'

Mr Scott is heard on the video growing extremely frantic as he witnesses the woman being mauled before his eyes and suggests running the dogs over.

Sheild: A woman tried to protect the victim by blocking the dog from further attack

Continuous: The attack went on for more than five minutes

Weapon: A passerby grabs a stick to try and fend off the dogs

Neighbours try to do all they can for the attack to stop. One woman acts as a human shield, lying on top of the victim, while a bystander drags the dogs away by their hind legs.

Another resident comes armed with a large stick and tries hitting the dogs, however it doesn't appear to make much difference and instead makes them even angrier.

By the time three police officers arrived, the victim was trying desperately to shield herself from one of the dogs, which was biting her on and near her head.

Neighbours screamed for the police to shoot the savages on the spot.

They didn't hesitate for a moment. Police fired five bullets, killing both dogs named Max and Marley.

Plainfield Police Captain Ed Santiago to Asbury Park Press said he had no issues with the officersâ€™ decision to act

'The next bite of a dog like that could have been a jugular. It could have killed her.'

'They werenâ€™t even paying attention to their owner,' Santiago added.

Defense: Wielding a large stick a resident tried to help the women

Law enforcement: Plainfiled, New Jersey cops arrive on the scene and are yelled at by residents to 'shoot the dogs!'

Unguarded: The dogs were able to escape into the street because their owner left the front gate unlocked

K'Shawn Scott: He filmed the video with his cell phone - 'The dogs, I could see it in their eyes, something had them angry.'

The dogs had been released into their backyard but the owner was unaware that her gate had been left open.

The dogs were able to get through the gate and into the front yard, where they attacked the victim.

Police say the owner of the dogs was issued four summonses for having vicious and unleashed dogs.

The victim, whom police identified as a 55-year-old Plainfield resident, was simply was walking down the street the attack occurred.

She was semi-conscious and bleeding when officers arrived and found one dog with its teeth around her head.

She is said to be in fair condition at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital where she is recovering to numerous dog bites to her head, hands and legs.
