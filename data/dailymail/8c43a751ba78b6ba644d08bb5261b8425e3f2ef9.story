A northeast Ohio couple have told police that a burglar broke in and made himself at home before ransacking the property.

The intruder seemed to be in no hurry because he or she took time to feed their dog bologna, make a pot of coffee and smoke some cigarettes.

Richard Nisely and his wife from Newton Falls told WKBN-TV they were picked up by police on an outstanding warrant earlier this week.

A northeast Ohio couple said an intruder made themselves comfortable when they broke into their home - eating bologna and drinking some coffee before stealing some of their belongings 

They secured the apartment when they left, but when the pair returned, the property had been trashed.  

Prescription drugs were stolen, along with a video game console, a DVD player and dozens of movies.

WFMJ-TV reports police determined that someone pried open a side door and that, as the police report put it, the intruder 'was comfortable while they were there.'

One of the residents suggested a possible suspect. Newton Falls police were investigating.
