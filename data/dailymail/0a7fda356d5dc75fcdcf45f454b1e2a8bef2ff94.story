Another hoard of lost masterpieces has been discovered in Austria by investigators looking into art looting by the Nazis.

More than 180 masterpieces have been found in the latest raid, including a 1903 Monet oil painting of London’s Tower Bridge worth £8 million.

The extraordinary collection also includes a bronze sculpture by Renoir and drawings by Gauguin, Cezanne and Picasso.

Another hoard of lost masterpieces has been discovered in Austria by investigators looking into art looting by the Nazis. The works were allegedly recovered from a property belonging to the reclusive son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, one of Hitler's aides

The works were allegedly recovered from a property belonging to the reclusive son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, one of Hitler’s aides.

Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, claimed he had inherited the collection from his father, who took orders from the dictator to buy and sell ‘degenerate art’ during the Second World War.

He aroused suspicion in 2010 when German customs officials stopped him on a train from Switzerland carrying a large sum in cash.

When authorities raided his Munich apartment in February 2012 on suspicion of tax evasion, they stumbled upon the vast art collection.

Investigators were then led to another property owned by Mr Gurlitt in Salzburg, western Austria, where they discovered a further 60 paintings.

An artwork by the German painter Franz Marc: At the end of the war 'Monuments Men' - the American army's art sleuths - quizzed Gurlitt's father on suspicion of criminal art dealing but he was never charged

Last week, a Vienna-based journalist revealed the existence of the third house linked to Mr Gurlitt, which is thought to have been used as a storage depot for the family collection.

The large estate in the village of Bad Aussee, Styria, is home to Roman salt mines that were used to store some 6,000 artworks, which Hitler tried to destroy shortly before the war ended.

It is estimated that less than half of the collection, recently featured in the George Clooney film The Monuments Men, was returned to the original owners.

The total number of works recovered now stands at 238.
