This is the heartwarming moment a soldier is reunited with his very excitable dog after being overseas in Afghanistan for seven months.

Video footage shows Simba the hound scampering around at home in Crestview, Florida, anticipating Sgt. Paul DiPaolo, 29, to arrive.

Then, as soon as his master opens the front door, the canine jumps all over him eventually forcing him to the ground.

Mr DiPaolo's wife, April, can be heard laughing as she films the sweet scene unfold.

Simba continues to bark and pant as he's showered with hugs.

He returns the affection with lots of licks. 

'Is it dad, is it daddy?' Mr DiPaolo repeats to his four-legged friend.

Mrs DiPaolo, 27, told Today.com that she captured the scene last June but only recently posted it online.

She said that Simba was 'depressed' and 'confused' while her husband was away but the two would communicate via Skype.  

After she picked her husband up from the Army base and the couple returned home, she crept through the garage door and made her husband wait outside.

She then positioned herself so she could film Simba's reaction when Mr DiPaolo walked in.

'I got him excited, asking, "Is it Daddy?"' and he was going crazy,' she said.

Along with Simba, the DiPaolos have a one-year-old son who was also undoubtedly pleased to see 'daddy home'.
