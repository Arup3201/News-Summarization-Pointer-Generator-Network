Sandy Thi Nguyen was sentenced to 90 days in jail after admitting child abuse and charitable fraud

A Colorado woman who convinced her six-year-old son he was dying from cancer to raise more than $25,000 in donations and get a free trip to Disneyland has been jailed.

Sandy Thi Nguyen, 28, of Aurora, was sentenced to 90 days in jail and five years on probation on Tuesday.

She had pleaded guilty to one count of charitable fraud and one count of child abuse in September.

Prosecutors said Nguyen told her son that he had leukaemia and got his chemotherapy at night when he was asleep. 

She would also shave his head every morning before he went to school. 

Nguyen told people she was in severe debt because of treatments for her son.

And at one point, she even said she had become pregnant in order to create a perfect match for stem cell treatment for her child.    

Several fundraisers were held for the child between April 2012 and March this year, when the scam was exposed.

Hundreds of students at Rolling Hills Elementary School donated $18,405.46 and a charity run in Piney Creek Hollow Park raised $7,767.90, reported the Denver Post. 

But the fraud was exposed when Nguyen was overheard by a doctor at the hair salon where she worked discussing her son's treatments at the Children's Hospital in Denver.

The doctor became concerned that she knew all the patients at the oncology unit at the hospital but did not recognise Nguyen's son. 

One of Nguyen's colleagues called police concerned that the family was receiving large sums of money from donations. 

Nguyen used $16,000 and also took her family on a Disneyland trip, the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said

The story of Nguyen's 'cancer-stricken' six-year-old son was also heavily featured in a charity race

After investigating, the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said in March that 'it was discovered that [Nguyen] did convince her son, family and community that her six-year-old had cancer and was receiving cancer treatment since approximately September 2012.'

One year later, 'over $25,000' was gathered by Aurora residents, the sheriff's office said.

It was revealed that 'over the last several months, Ms. Nguyen accepted at least $16,000.00 from that account as well as a trip to Disneyland for herself and her family, which was paid for by the donated funds.'

Around $23,000 was found inside her home 'and in a subsequent interview, [Nguyen] admitted that her son does not have cancer, and stated that some of the money recovered was from donations received,' the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said.

Nguyen's son, in excerpts of an arrest affidavit published by CBS Denver, said 'he believes he has cancer and is going to die' and was under the impression he received nightly chemotherapy treatments. 

The boy also revealed 'his mom shaves his head every morning before school,' according to the published excerpts.

It was reported  Nguyen's 'cancer-stricken' son was also heavily featured in a charity race, and that she posted 'updates' on his treatment online.

Officials said Nguyen allegedly posted a fake list of cancer treatments for her son online

The principal of the boy's school, Darla Thompson, said at the time: 'We are deeply troubled by these allegations and saddened to learn that an adult may have taken advantage of an innocent child and our school community.'

'But the allegations do not, in any way, diminish the concern and support demonstrated by the Rolling Hills community for a child believed to be facing a life-threatening challenge.

'It is important for our community to continue to show support and compassion for this child, who is also a victim in this case. 

'The child was wrongfully led to believe that he was ill, and he was not responsible for the parent’s alleged actions.'
