Chaps, if you want to impress a woman, don’t talk about work.

An analysis of almost 1,000 speed dates, showed that females switched off when a prospective beau started chatting about his job.

Much more successful, was allowing the woman to talk about herself. And, surprisingly, interrupting her.

Talking about your work rather than your date is likely to put off a woman, according to research by scientists

Researchers from Stanford University in the US, listened to recordings made during speed dating events, in which a man has just four minutes to impress a woman before moving on to talk to another one.

Researchers studying videos of men and women who had never met before talking together have worked out the science of flirting.

Their findings could help you spot whether someone is interested in you or not. 

1-3 minutes

If someone begins talking to you by dishing out compliments and being encouraging to things you say, it is a good indicator they are interested - according to the researchers.

Some people will also give a quick flirtatious glance at the start of the conversation.

Crossing legs at any point, though, was a sign that a person was not interested in the other.

Also, if a woman doesn't ask many questions, or shrugs a lot, she probably isn't interested. 

4-6 minutes

If the person is still attracted to you, they will likely be even more affirmative, and also still quite complimentary.

They will also begin ‘palming' - talking using open palm gestures.

7-9 minutes

Now, people start to do-away with compliments.

Instead, men will gaze at their partner if they are interested at this point, while women might start to divulge some personal details.

10-12 minutes

At the end of the conversation, women will open up and be joyful, while still palming, if they are still interested.

For women, you’ll want to look for a guy who has lowered his pitch from the earlier part of the interaction. This means they are still interested.

At the end of the night, the women are asked which men they would like to see again and vice-versa.

Men will typically say they’d like to see most of the women again, the females will be choosier.

Both sexes must agree before a proper meeting is set up and so the women hold the balance of power.

This could help explain why one of the secrets of success was to allow the woman to talk about herself.

Linguist Dan Jurafsky said: ‘We went in assuming that men would talk about themselves.

‘And we were surprised to find that the stereotype just wasn’t true.

‘Women in successful dates talked more about themselves. They used the word “I” more.

‘Men talked about the woman more. They used the word “you’ more.’

Professor Jurafksy’s analysis also showed that women liked men who interrupted them.

He said: ‘The men would interrupt a lot. We thought interruption would usually be a sign of taking the floor and of being rude but all of these interruptions were sympathetic interruptions.

‘They would stop someone and say “Oh, that exactly happened to me too”.

‘They were attentive listening-type interruptions.

‘And women, in a date that clicked, showed signs of engagement. They varied their pitch a lot, they varied their loudness, they got louder and softer.

‘So, on a good date, the woman was engaged and the man was attentive.’

However, women really didn’t like men who were hesitant, with time-buying phrases such as ‘kind of’ and ‘sort of’ interpreted as a sign of awkwardness.

And they really didn’t like chit-chat about work.

The professor told the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s annual conference in San Jose: ‘The more a man talked about work, the worse the date went.

Women see men who talk shop as having little personality while phrases like 'kind of' suggested hesitance

‘We interpret that as if you have nothing to click on, no personal interaction, you fall back to talking about your work and that’s, of course, a bad thing.’

The men, in contrast, were far less choosy.

Asked what the women did wrong in the speed dates, Professor Jurafksy said: ‘Oh, not much.’

In successful dates, women tended to use the word 'I' far more frequently

Men in dates deemed to be successful, however, used the word 'you' more

Surprisingly, men who interrupted more often were also more successful
