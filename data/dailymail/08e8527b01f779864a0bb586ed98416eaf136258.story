One of the most shocking Super Bowl ads will feature a real American who is using her time in the spotlight to quit her job.

GoDaddy has revealed that one of their two costly ads will feature a woman, whose identity will remain a mystery until Sunday night, who will announce her departure from her current job in the TV spot.

The company released a teaser video about the ad this morning with actor John Turtutto walking into a home as he tells how someone is preparing to pursue her dream.

Ushering in the quitter: Actor John Turtutto is featured in the teaser that announces how a woman will quit her job in real time as part of a GoDaddy Super Bowl commercial

No clues except the gender of the individual have been released, with her name being bleeped out in the teaser video.

'She's a real person with a real dream of starting her very own business,' Turtutto says.

'She's got a message for her boss in front of a hundred million people.'

GoDaddy confirmed the validity of the stunt, issuing a statement saying: ‘Her boss doesn't know! He or she is going to find out while watching the commercial with the rest of the viewers—after the commercial, a formal resignation letter will be delivered and she'll give her two-week notice.’

The company is inevitably trying to make their commercial the latest in a string of very public quitting videos.

Mystery: No clues have been revealed about the woman's identity

The most well-known in the genre came from Marina Schifrin, a video editor who filmed a synchronized dance routine to a Kanye West song that listed out her reasons for wanting to leave her job.

In case the woman's 'I quit' moment, which the company has called 'gutsy', doesn't become viral, they have a second commercial planned out as well.

The second ad, which has been released in full online already, goes along the website domain hosting company's more traditional advertising route.

Other route: The company's second Super Bowl ad features shirtless body builders and spokeswoman Danica Patrick

It features a stampede of bare-chested body builders- and company spokeswoman Danica Patrick- racing to a tanning salon after the fictional shop's owner listed it using one of their websites.

Advertising experts see the two commercials not as a stunt but as an indication that GoDaddy is attempting to change their public image in a way to support women.

'GoDaddy is evolving its messaging away from sleaze and toward a more respectable focus on women as business owners,' AdWeek speculated.

By contrast, their 2013 Super Bowl ad featured model Bar Rafaeli making out with 'geek' Jesse Heiman.
