Happy days: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden is enjoying life in Russia according to his father Lon

NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden is enjoying his new life in Russia and believes he is out of danger, his father Lon claimed on today.

'He feels safe here and totally happy,' said Snowden senior as he left Moscow after an 'emotional' reunion with his controversial 'whistleblower' son.

'He is grateful to Russia, and admits that he imagined it to be a very different country.'

Former CIA contractor Snowden, 30, has
 applied for political asylum in Russia after spilling US - and British -
 secrets over telephone and internet snooping.

His
 father's account, given to a Kremlin-friendly tabloid online news site 
as he left Moscow after seeing his son for the first time in exile, will
 raise questions over the extent to which the former National Security 
Agency analyst is now cocooned by the Russian intelligence 
establishment.

Lon 
Snowden had only positive things to say about Russia in a statement 
retranslated into English as the American Coast Guard veteran returned 
home.

'Being a true American
 he used to think of Russia differently. He expected to find Moscow 
rather a bleak city, but what he found was a modern metropolis with 
multiple possibilities,' he enthused.

'He has walked Moscow's streets and been to museums and Red Square. People recognised him and he realised Muscovites take to him in a very friendly manner.

'He hasn't changed a bit and he is absolutely happy since he feels that his life is totally our of danger.'

This
 contrasts with his lawyer Anatoly Kucherena's regular claims that 
Snowden is in danger of a dirty tricks operation by CIA agents in 
Moscow.

'It is a pleasure 
for me as well, as it would be for any father, because I can see my 
child living happily in Moscow and not worry about a single thing,' he 
was quoted saying by Life News.

'My son is a very clever young man, a very perceptive one, and Moscow offers thousands of possibilities for self realisation.

'But the question of his employment is not sorted yet and he doesn't know just where he will be working.'

Fears have been expressed in the West that Snowden may have been forced to give away his secrets to the Russian FSB in return for his safe haven.

Snowden's own view of Russia has not yet emerged. The American accompanied his father to the airport after his week-long stay and was reported to have said "Dad I love you" as they parted.

The bespectacled analyst has remained largely in the shadows since arriving in Moscow in June, emerging more than a month later from the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport to begin life as an asylum applicant.

Details of where and how he lives have been deemed too sensitive to reveal.

'Snowden senior is very happy with the way he was received in Russia and the way that his son is being treated,' added lawyer Kucherena.

'He still loves his son very much and views him as a completely honest person who did the right thing.'

Originally Snowden had intended to transit Moscow and seek exile in South America but is now extended to remain in Russia for the long term.

Moscow has defied US calls for him to be handed over so he can face espionage charges in his homeland.
