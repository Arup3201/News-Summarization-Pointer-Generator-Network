Downsizing: When Mark Thompson took on the role in 2004 he had a basic salary of £609,000 and a further £10,000 in pension top-ups and bonuses

The new BBC director general will not be eligible for a bonus or pension top-ups and will have a salary under £500,000.

In a sign that the corporation has heeded public anger at inflated salaries, the corporation has dramatically scaled back the perks of the job.

When Mark Thompson took on the role in 2004 he had a basic salary of £609,000 and a further £10,000 in pension top-ups and bonuses.

By 2010 his total remuneration package was at a high of £838,000 before he agreed to curb is pay as part of rigorous cost-cutting measures.

Thompson, 54, now earns £671,000 a year but one senior insider said it would be “a surprise” if the new director general is paid more than £450,000.

The BBC has now begun its search for a replacement, unveiling an advert for the role on its website calling for an 'inspirational' leader to take the helm.

Despite the job being both chief executive and editor-in-chief of one of the biggest news providers, broadcasters and producers in the world, it is not a 'must have' for applicants to have journalistic or programme-making experience.

The advert said: ‘Experience as a journalist and/or programme maker would be desirable but is not essential,’ the ad states.

‘Understanding of new platforms and technologies (for example, online and mobile) is essential. Experience of harnessing these to transform business performance would be valuable.’

Odds on: The BBC's chief operating officer Caroline Thomson is favourite for the role according to bookmakers William Hill who have made her 5/2 on to get the job

It also stipulated the new boss needed to 'be able to admit quickly when in the wrong... but stand up to huge pressure without bending when s/he believes that it is right so to do.'

Mr Thompson announced he was stepping down last month and said he would go 'once the Olympics and the rest of the amazing summer of 2012 are over.'

He said he wanted his successor to “have time to really get their feet under the table” before the next review of the BBC charter which will take place before the end of 2016.

The advert states: 'The Trust is looking for an inspirational leader with the strong, clear vision that will take the BBC through the next review of the Corporation’s Charter, ready for the world as it will be in 10 or 15 years time.'

Other contenders include George Entwistle - director of BBC Vision - who is 11/4 and current ITV boss Peter Fincham who is 12/1.

BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten has made clear that whoever takes over - they will not be paid as much as Mark Thompson.

He said in a recent interview: ‘The biggest issue for the public is senior executive pay, because what’s happened does seem to fly in the face of public service ethos.

‘And I think we can deal with all that; and if we do so, we’ll deal with one of the most toxic reasons for the public’s lack of sympathy for the BBC as an institution, even though they like enormously what it does.’

One suggestion he made was capping senior salaries but he has made clear that he feels there should be a limit to the number of BBC executives who are paid more than the Prime Minister’s £142,500 a year.

The advert states that 'remuneration will reflect the unique challenge and privilege of leading the BBC, as well as the fact that it is financed by licence fee payers.'

Big move: Mr Thompson also oversaw the move to Salford which has seen around 2,500 staff move north and some high-profile faces, including BBC Breakfast presenter Sian Williams, refuse to go

It adds that there will be a “annual base salary” but no “variable component” which refers to bonuses and pension top ups.

Applicants have until May 7 to throw their name into the hat and it is hoped that a successor will be found by the summer.

Mr Thompson’s time in the top job saw the BBC hit by scandals including Sachsgate which saw a public outcry over obscene messages left by Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand on Andrew Sachs’ answerphone which were then broadcast on Brand’s Radio 2 show.

In 2007, there was also Crowngate which saw Mr Fincham, then BBC1 controller, resign after misleading footage appearing to show the Queen storming out of a photoshoot was used in a trailer.

Issues of excessive pay, salaries for top talent and the treatment of older women presenters also caused problems.

Mr Thompson also oversaw the move to Salford which has seen around 2,500 staff move north and some high-profile faces, including BBC Breakfast presenter Sian Williams, refuse to go.

Successes include the launch of the iPlayer which has been a huge hit and allows viewers to catch up on shows via internet-connected TVs, computers and mobile phones.

Mr Thompson also oversaw the Delivering Quality First process which saw the BBC commit to saving billions of pounds from its budget after the annual licence fee was frozen at £145.50 for six years.
