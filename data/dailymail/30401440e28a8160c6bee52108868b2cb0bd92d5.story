A New York woman who infamously survived a cocaine-fueled three-way sex romp in a swanky Manhattan hotel that lead to the death of another woman has now been found dead of a suspected drug overdose.

Nicole Zobkiw, 31, of Wantagh, was involved in the 2009 orgy with Long Island banana mogul Thomas Hoey Jr at $700-a-night suite at The Kitano hotel on Park Avenue, which ended in the death of personal trainer Kimberley Calo, 41.

Calo, a mother of two, collapsed and began frothing at the mouth and bleeding from the nose on the April night after snorting too much of the potent cocaine, which was supplied by Hoey.

Zobkiw was found dead 'or close to it' by her boyfriend on Wednesday, with police suspecting cocaine as the cause of death, The New York Post reported.

Dead: Nicole Zobkiw, 31, of Wantagh, Long Island, was found dead Wednesday of a suspected cocaine overdose, according to reports. She was one third of a drug-fueled threesome that killed a woman in 2009

Slip up: Banana mogul Thomas Hoey pleaded guilty in August to charges he supplied a sex partner with fatally potent cocaine and delayed calling for help when she overdosed during a three-way sex romp

Zobkiw was convicted of perjury in 2013 after lying to a grand jury about what happened on the night of Calo's death in order to protect Hoey, her ex-boyfriend.

She had not yet been sentenced.

Hoey finally admitted in federal court in August that he delayed calling for help when Calo starting having a seizure.

The millionaire owner of Long Island Banana Corp even confessed he continued to supply friends with cocaine following Calo's gruesome death as he helped hamper authorities' efforts to bring him to justice through 2010.

He also admitted to coercing Zobkiw to lie on the stand.

Hoey
 is charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, aiding in perjury 
conspiracy and obstruction of justice, the Post reported, and is expected to get 11 years in prison.

He will be sentenced in February. 

Hoey's guilty pleas were the culmination of years of speculation and 
accusations regarding the importer's hard-partying and callous ways. 

Victim: Personal trainer and mother-of-two Kimberley Calo, 41, died in the Upper East Side's Kitano hotel after Thomas Hoey Jr neglected to call for help in time to save her following a cocaine binge

Hoey allegedly wasn't alarmed by Calo's condition and said 'he’d seen this before' and that she 'was going to be fine.'

The
 banana mogul had sex with Zobkiw and then set his attention towards 
Calo, a personal trainer, retired NYPD detective Edward Boyle, who 
investigated Calo's 2009 death, said on the stand in 2013.

Calo
 had first snorted the coke laying on a coffee table and when she went 
back for more, she began overdosing and 'her head dropped to the table 
with a thud,' Boyle told jurors at Manhattan federal court, where Zobkiw
 was on trial for making false statements and perjury.

Zobkiw was later found guilty of lying to a grand jury about the fatal party.

The
 court was told Zobkiw attempted to get Hoey to call the emergency 
services but he refused, allegedly telling her that Calo would be fine. 

Zobkiw was seen in a security video going to the hotel reception three times to try and get help, Boyle revealed. 

Boyle told the court that Hoey assured Zobkiw that a 'doctor friend' was on the way.

Hoey also admitted to coercing the other woman there that night, Nicole Zobkiw, to lie for him about the night's events while under oath (pictured is the scene of the tragedy, the Kitano Hotel)

Zobkiw's lawyer Leonard Lato admitted his client had to tried to hide what happened on the night.

But she was intimidated two days before her grand jury testimony in 2011 by a 'corrupt lawyer' allegedly linked to Hoey, Lato said. 

Under his new plea deal, Hoey faces 11 to 13 years in prison on federal charges.

For the state charges he tampered with evidence by trying to clean up Calo's blood, Hoey faces four years. 

Hoey hit headlines again in August after his current girlfriend, Alison Bretherick, stood up for him in court in a separate case.

Hoey was accused of beating Bretherick, 29, to a pulp in 2012.

The attack left Bretherick bleeding from the scalp, unable to hear in one ear and with chipped teeth.

She also reportedly feared Hoey so much that she had written on the back of a photo of her grandfather: 'If you find me dead, Thomas Hoey did it.'

However Bretherick refused to turn on her man and, in court recently, denied ever being assaulted.
