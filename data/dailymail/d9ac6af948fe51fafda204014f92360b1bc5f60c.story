One in three businesses is losing money and the road to Britain's economic recovery will be 'long and winding', the Bank of England warned yesterday.

Experts dubbed these firms 'zombie businesses' which have survived only because interest rates are at an historic low and the banks are reluctant to pull the plug on them.

It raises fears of large-scale job losses if the base rate of 0.5 per cent is raised, a move which would tip many firms over the edge.

The big squeeze: How the Consumer Prices Index rate of inflation compares to year-on-year rises in pay, according to the Office for National Statistics

The Bank's Inflation Report published yesterday said the latest estimate is that 30.6 per cent of firms are losing money, a number which has increased sharply in recent years.

The report warned the current situation 'may have allowed  businesses that will face lower demand in the longer term to continue trading'.

Sir Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, painted a bleak picture of the future, offering little hope for an improvement in Britain's anaemic economic recovery.

Nearly
30million people aged 16 and over are in work – but almost half of the 
new jobs created in recent months were part-time, official figures 
revealed yesterday.

The part-time boom has seen many 
workers forced to accept such work despite desperately needing the 
higher salary that comes with a full-time job.

Between July and September, the 
number in work jumped by 100,000 to 29.58million, equal to more than 
1,000 new jobs every day, the Office for National Statistics said.

But of the 100,000 increase in employment, only 51,000 were full-time jobs and 49,000 were part-time.

The ONS said 8.1million people, close to an all-time record, are working part-time.

Of these, 1.4million say it is only because they ‘could not find a full-time job.’

Overall, the ONS said unemployment has dropped again, down 49,000 between July and September to 2.51million.

Long-term unemployment is a 
ballooning problem. Nearly half of those aged 50 and over have been 
unemployed for more than 12 months.

He said people should not be optimistic after the latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed economic growth of 1 per cent between July and September.

The figure is 'not a reliable guide to
the future', warned Sir Mervyn. He said: 'Continuing the recent zig-zag
pattern, output growth is likely to fall back sharply in the fourth 
quarter as the boost from the Olympics in the summer is reversed – 
indeed, output may shrink a little this quarter.'

The report said Britain should brace itself for 'a period of persistently low growth'.

Sir
Mervyn, who retires next year, added: 'We have decided the chances of a
rapid recovery are a good deal less than we thought.'

He said economic growth is 'more 
likely to be below than above its historical average rate over the 
entire forecast period' – which is the next three years.

The Bank's report reveals the number of firms which are collapsing is much lower than in the last recession in the early 1990s.

Around
55 companies every day are being plunged into insolvency, according to 
the financial information firm Experian.

But the Bank said the number of
loss-making firms is high, amid warnings from experts that a third of 
'zombie businesses' are at risk if they do not urgently get help to 
solve  their problems.

A 
'zombie' company can pay the interest on its debts but not repay the 
debt itself, leaving it particularly vulnerable to a rise in borrowing 
costs or a loss of business.

Warning: Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, has predicted the economy could be shrinking again due to a 'zig-zag' recovery

Christine
Elliott, chief executive of the Institute for Turnaround, which 
represents experts who specialise in rescuing businesses, said: 'If they
are not given the tough, loving care that they need, they are 
definitely at risk.

'The worrying thing about the situation is that there are jobs at risk. These businesses employ people whose livelihood depends on their job.'

Employment minister Mark Hoban said the fall in youth unemployment was particularly welcome

Jon Moulton, chairman of investment 
firm Better Capital, said the fact that businesses are being kept 
artificially alive is a problem.

He
told the BBC that in previous recessions they would have been 'tossed 
into the bonfire and something better emerges', but 'the Darwin system' 
is not happening.

'About 10
per cent of the private sector workforce are working in companies which
should have been sorted out,' Mr Moulton said.

'That is one of the reasons the economy is not recovering quickly. We need failure as part of the solution.'

According to R3, the industry group 
that represents insolvency practitioners, there are as many  as 146,000 
zombie businesses in  the UK.

Despite the weak state of the economy, the Bank's report said that employment in the private sector remains 'puzzlingly robust'.

At present, 23.9million people work in
the private sector, the largest number since records began, although 
many are having to work part-time unwillingly.

David
Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the 
report paints 'a grim but realistic outlook for the UK economy'.

Unemployment fell by 49,000 in the three months to September, but is still much higher than three years ago

Supermarket giant Tesco received a staggering 8,000 applicants for 400 jobs at a brand new store opening later this month.

It means 20 people were chasing every single job at the new branch.

The new store is opening in Woolwich,
South East London, which is an area renowned for its high levels of 
unemployment. Greenwich Council says that 65 per cent of jobs have gone 
to people from the Woolwich area.

Council leader Chris Roberts said: 
'The amount of applications does show that we do need more jobs in the 
area, which is why we are keen to promote regeneration schemes.'

The shopworkers' trade union, USDAW, 
says the huge flood of job requests is a sign of high unemployment 
rates. But it said competition is often fierce among candidates for 
Tesco jobs as pay rates are better than at other supermarkets.

The USDAW spokesman said : 'The sort 
of response a store gets to its job adverts depends on the level of 
unemployment in the area.

'This is probably a sign of the 
times, but also probably a sign of the remuneration package and other 
benefits they offer. They are one of the best payers in the supermarket 
sector.'

Among the new recruits at the 
Woolwich store is a former bus driver who struggled to find work after 
he left his job of 20 years on the death of his wife.

A single mother struggling to support her young daughter has also been recruited.

The company set up a special training scheme for men and women who applied and had been out of work for more than six months.

The scheme, run in cooperation with Greenwich Council, saw the last 92 trainees complete their course this week.

Tesco's corporate affairs manager Matthew Magee said : 'This is the kind of response we get when we open a new store.

'There are great opportunities for people. In the last few store openings, we have had huge numbers of applications.

'All our pay rates are over the minimum wage and we are the leading payer in the industry.'
