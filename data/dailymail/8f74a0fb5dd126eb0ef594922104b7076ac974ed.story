Alan Pardew returned one of his self-labelled ‘death stares’ when Sportsmail dared to suggest this week that his chances of managing England had passed.

He did, in fairness, kill the query with a smile – kind of – but his wider point was: ‘Why has my chance gone?’ He very quickly left the room.

A parallel with Sam Allardyce was the subtext of the question; English managers once touted for the national job but no longer in the running, at least according to bookmakers’ markets and popular opinion, which has the likes of Gary Neville and Gareth Southgate as the heir apparents – even Nigel Adkins is quoted at shorter odds.

Roy Hodgson, of course, is safe until after England cruise through qualifying and flop at Euro 2016.

And so the search will begin. Were we, however, to employ the yardsticks of performance and experience in determining the favourites, Pardew and Allardyce would lead the way.

The pair meet at Upton Park on Saturday afternoon, Pardew’s Magpies flying high in fifth with Allardyce’s West Ham in their slipstream.

They are the two longest-serving Englishmen in the Premier League – Pardew 12 days short of four years, Allardyce just six months behind. In total, their time in the dugout amounts to nearly 40 years.

Yet the notion of them one day being employed by the Football Association appears to be dead. Allardyce – with his stock at its highest in 2006 – lost out to Steve McClaren for the England post and has long since been critical of foreign appointments.

Pardew, meanwhile, has muddied his own CV during the course of touchline confrontations with Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini and Hull midfielder David Meyler, not to mention shoving an assistant referee.

Does all of that, though, not make their case all the stronger? They have dealt with adversity – a guaranteed circumstance with England – and survived; their longevity is unrivalled.

Indeed, in the past 12 months both have been that ‘beleaguered boss’ at which the media takes aim, ultimately riding the storm to emerge in far more cordial climes.

Pardew, from the position of comfort which six wins on the spin affords, addressed the issue this week.

‘In the Premier League you come under pressure from time to time,’ he said. ‘You have to be big enough to handle that. Some of it gets personal and you have to deal with that, you might not like it.

‘Sam has more experience of the Premier League than I do. He knows what it takes to win and he’s adaptable.

Even Reading boss Nigel Adkins is fancied more for the role than the two in-form Englishmen 

‘You have to keep your message consistent and not lose faith in yourself and what you’re doing.’

Are Allardyce and Pardew, then, simply better suited to the club-management environment in which they have thrived for so long?

Pardew, it seems, still fancies a shot at England. Don’t forget, he was LMA and Premier League Manager of the Year in 2012 and part of the thinking behind his unprecedented eight-year contract with Newcastle was to inflate any compensation package should the FA come calling.

But Team England have moved on. Rather, it is the Nevilles and the Southgates who are the future and a new ‘promote from within’ ethos.

Pardew and Allardyce, meanwhile, are very much on the outside. Just don't mention that to their face.
