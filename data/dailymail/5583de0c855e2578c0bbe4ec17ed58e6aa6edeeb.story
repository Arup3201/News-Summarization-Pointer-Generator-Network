Leading by example: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said he would consider hiring a convicted criminal in a bid to encourage other employers to do the same

They say crime doesn’t pay, but it would appear the experts don’t agree.

One in five offenders have told an official government survey they agree with the statement ‘in the end crime does pay’.

The Ministry of Justice survey of nearly 3,000 criminals on community service found one in five also accepted that crime ‘can be a useful way of getting what you want’.

And it revealed the extent to which law-breakers are in denial about their lives.

Three-quarters of those surveyed said they didn’t see themselves as a ‘real criminal’.

One in four said they thought many crimes were in fact ‘not really wrong’, and around same proportion said their crimes have ‘never harmed anyone’.

The vast majority also have high expectations for their ability to break their habit: nearly eight in ten disagreed with the statement ‘once a criminal, always a criminal’.

However, separate figures released yesterday by the same department showed the staggering extent of reoffending by prison inmates.

The average prisoner, the figures revealed, has some 41 crimes to their name.

Chris Grayling published the data as he launched new plans to slash reoffending and end what he called the ‘depressing Merry-go-round’ of crime.

The Justice Secretary announced he wants more criminals to find jobs when they get out of prison. And he is considering setting an example by hiring one to work in his own office.

In a major speech to the Civitas think tank, Mr Grayling urged companies and the public sector - including the NHS - to hire convicted criminals.

And, asked by an charity for ex-offenders if he would consider taking on one in the Ministry of Justice he agreed it was right to ‘lead from the front’.

Mr Grayling said: ‘I’m very up for the idea of looking to see where we can find more educational or work opportunities for former offenders and of course we should lead from the front with that.

Crime and punishment: The Ministry of Justice survey of nearly 3,000 criminals on community service found one in five thought that crime 'can be a useful way of getting what you want'

‘We’re a big organisation that does 
an awful lot of things and there’s no reason why we shouldn’t look to 
find opportunities within the organisation that are right for them.’ 

Mr Grayling hailed the results of a ‘very promising’ pilot programme in which ex-cons mentored current inmates.

The project in Peterborough Prison saw a five per cent lower reconviction rate than the national average.

If repeated across the country it could reduce crime by some 30,000 offences a year.

Mr Grayling said there was no reason why ex-offenders could not find positions in the public sector, including the NHS.

He said: ‘I see no reason why a former 
offender cannot do an apprenticeship course and end up in a technical 
role, in NHS logistics for example.

Reformed: Mr Grayling introduced plans to slash reoffending and end what he called the 'depressing merry-go-round' of crime

‘We have employers across the board willing to give offenders a chance and it’s in all of our interest to ensure that someone who has been to prison gets a chance to get into employment when they leave and not re-offend again.’ 

The cost of reoffending is put at between nine and 13 billion pounds a year.

Mr Grayling said: ‘When you find out that the person who burgled you, the person who attacked you in the street, has already been round the system scores of times, you’re entitled to ask why the system didn’t do more to prevent you getting hurt, as others had before you.’ 

He added: ‘Britain’s problem is less about offending and more about re-offending'

In a radical reform of the £2billion probation service, private companies and charities will be paid by results for helping to reform repeat criminals.
