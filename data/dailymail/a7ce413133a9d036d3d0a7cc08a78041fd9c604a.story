A businesswoman who has been missing for three months has been impersonated by at least three women trying to use her credit cards since she vanished, police believe

Detectives investigating the disappearance of millionairess Carole Waugh have also charged an unemployed man with fraud offences after hundreds of thousands of pounds were taken from her bank accounts.

The 50-year-old vanished from her £650,000 London flat on May 4 and has not been heard from since April 17.

Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been
taken from her bank and her cash cards have been used in shopping 
sprees at the Westfield centre in West London.

Scotland Yard released CCTV images yesterday of two women buying goods there with Miss Waugh’s bank cards on July 13.

These images were taken at the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherds Bush on Friday July 13. Detectives want to speak to the two women pictured here in connection with the search for Miss Waugh

Detectives believe the pair may be part of a gang that abducted her and made her divulge her PINs.

Officers from Scotland Yard last week
arrested four men and two women in connection with their inquiry and 
yesterday charged unemployed Rakesh Bhayani with three counts of 
conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation.

The charges relate to transactions associated with Ms Waugh’s identity worth in the region of £280,000, police said.

Bhayani, 40, of Wembley, will appear via virtual court at Westminster Magistrates’ Court later today.

The five other suspects have been bailed pending further investigations, the Met added.

Ms Waugh, whose disappearance is being investigated by the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, lives in the exclusive Marylebone area of the capital.

The detective said Miss Waugh’s £650,000 flat in Marylebone was now being examined in great detail by a forensic team and was likely to take several days.

The former civil servant, who made a 
fortune working in Libya as a finance manager for oil companies during 
the reign of Colonel Gaddafi, returned to London in 2008, apparently 
looking for love.

She was single and police are trying to trace men she may have met through internet dating sites.

Detective Chief Inspector John 
McFarlane, who is leading the investigation, said there has been no 
confirmed contact with her for three months.

Carole Waugh was last seen shopping in Central London on May 4. She failed to turn up for family birthday celebrations or for the start of a new job in Malta

He said: 'There have been a number of
sightings of her but I have not been able to confirm them at this 
stage. The last time she had any contact with her family was on April 
17.

'Since Carole was last seen at least 
three women have been involved in impersonating her at a number of 
different venues. I also believe there are a number of men involved in 
the fraud.' 

Yesterday it emerged that power cables to a CCTV camera pointing at her flat were cut in the lead-up to her disappearance.

Neighbours have reported large numbers of people coming and going from her home following her disappearance.

Yesterday her brother Chris, a 
54-year-old bank manager, said: ‘She is a very confident businesswoman 
who has done very well for herself.

‘She is very wealthy and she doesn’t need to work. Despite her being a very focused businesswoman, she was looking for Mr Right.

‘I think someone has targeted her as a
single woman in London with a nice property and money and we don’t know
if they have befriended her or just taken her.’

Just before she went 
missing, Miss Waugh turned down a job offer in Malta and was planning a 
50th birthday trip to Las Vegas with a group of friends.

Her brother and 78-year-old mother 
Margaret, who both live in Durham, last saw her at Easter when she told 
them about the American trip scheduled for June. ‘She seemed fine. She 
was really looking forward to it,’ added Mr Waugh.

‘She was not worried about turning 50. She was looking forward to all the fuss and attention.

‘She phoned her mother every other day and suddenly the calls just stopped. My mother is absolutely beside herself.

‘We are very concerned about her. My mother is rather ill and it has had a real impact on her health.’

Miss Waugh's family say her disappearance is 'totally out of character'

Forensic experts are now examining 
Miss Waugh’s two-bedroom flat near Marble Arch in central London for 
signs of a break-in or struggle.

Police say she was last seen shopping in the capital on May 4.

Her hobbies included going to the 
opera, ballet and jogging and she was often seen sporting a £4,000 
Cartier gold bracelet and a man’s Breitling watch worth a similar 
amount.

Detective Chief Inspector John 
McFarlane, said: ‘Miss 
Waugh is a successful businesswoman, originally from the Durham area.

‘She has worked in the Middle East and has maintained a home in central London for a number of years.

‘Her disappearance is very out of 
character. Both her family and I are very concerned, and ask for the 
help of the public in tracing her.

The detective said Miss Waugh’s £650,000 flat in Marylebone was now being examined in great detail by a forensic team and was likely to take several days.

Miss Waugh moved to London at 25 and spent eight years working for Veba Oil in Libya from 2000 to 2008.

Anyone with information should contact police on 020 8721 4205 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
