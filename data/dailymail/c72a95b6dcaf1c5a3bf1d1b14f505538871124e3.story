Homeowners pay £47,000 more to live ‘the good life’ in the countryside rather than in Britain’s towns and cities, research shows.

Rural properties cost about 26 per cent more than homes in suburbs and city centres, despite the gap closing in recent years.

Buyers pay an average premium of £46,600 for homes in the country, a study by Halifax found.

Research has found homeowners pay £47,000 more to live ‘the good life’ in the countryside rather than in towns and cities

The cost for country living varied wildly across England and was greatest in the West Midlands, where rural properties were about £89,000 more.

This compares to the north-east where it cost only £17,570 more to live in the countryside.

Prices in urban areas have been rising faster over the past five years, increasing by 18 per cent compared to 12 per cent in rural areas, but it continues to be the cheaper option.

Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax, said: ‘It typically costs significantly more to buy in rural areas with a substantial premium existing in all the regions of Great Britain.

‘This reflects the aspiration of many to own a property in the countryside.

‘The relatively high prices, however, put rural homes out of the reach for many, particularly the young.

‘This is reflected in first-time buyers accounting for a smaller proportion of homebuyers in the countryside than in urban areas.’

Regardless of where you are hoping to buy - whether it be in the countryside or town - getting the right mortgage is essential to making sure buying a home is as affordable as possible.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of options out there, so, as well as doing your own research, this is an occasion to search out expert opinion from a good mortgage broker.

First, read Mail Online's award-winning money section This is Money's regularly updated What next for mortgage rates? This outlines the current state of the market and highlights the current best buy deals.

Then also check the top mortgage deals on offer currently in our best buy mortgage tables, or click through by using our helpful table (right).

You should now be armed with some knowledge about what is on offer and you can use our True cost mortgage calculator to compare how different deals stack up.

You should also talk to a mortgage broker.

There is no obligation to go through with their recommendation and so they may not end up actually arranging the mortgage for you, but they will be able to explain your options and help you to find the best deal.

Go a broker who offers advice from the whole market. 

Avoid brokers who offer a restricted service based on products from a limited number of lenders, and don't just simply go to your bank - unless you get lucky, you will be unlikely to find the best deal this way
