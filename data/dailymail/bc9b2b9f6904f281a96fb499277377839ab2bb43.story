New England beat Detroit, Green Bay beat Minnesota and wins for Denver, Dallas, Seattle and San Francisco  

Odell Beckham Jnr made one of the best catches in NFL history when he pulled in a 43-yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning as his New York Giants side went down to the Dallas Cowboys at MetLife Stadium on Sunday.

The Giants rookie receiver was pressured by Brandon Carr but shrugged off the Cowboys cornerback and leaned back to make a sensational one-handed grab at full stretch before landing in the corner of the end zone.

Beckham also drew flags for being held by Carr as he gave the Giants a 14-3 lead over the  their NFC East rivals.
