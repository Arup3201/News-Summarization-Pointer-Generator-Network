Ever  since man embarked on his ceaseless quest for knowledge, there have been questions that don’t really need answers.

But yesterday some of the finest minds of science, engineering and craftsmanship combined to examine one of them anyway: precisely how useless is a chocolate teapot?

Would it turn into a steaming, molten splodge as soon as boiling water was introduced? Wouldn’t the spout just go floppy and prevent the tea being poured? And surely the brew would taste like a cross between day-old hot choc and recycled canal water?

Useful at last! A team of scientists and engineers have created a fully-functioning chocolate teapot (pictured) that can brew tea for two minutes without completely melting

All these imponderables
 faced a specialist team at Nestlé when the corporation set about trying
 to determine the effectiveness or otherwise of a mythical piece of 
culinary equipment that has become part of modern English usage as an 
insult (To wit: ‘He’s as useful as a chocolate teapot’).

It
 took six weeks of planning, countless equations and several failed 
prototypes before master chocolatier John Costello and his team at the 
Nestlé Product Technology Centre in York were ready to craft the perfect
 teapot from chocolate.

The moment of truth: Scientists settled on using dark chocolate with 65 per cent chocolate solids, due to its fat content. Here, One Show presenter Marty Jopson pours hot water into the chocolate teapot

Chocolate ingredients determine the material's heat resistance and its melting point.

Chocolatiers are interested in the science of chocolate to influence how it tastes and feels in the mouth.

The melting point is typically just above 36°C so it melts in the mouth, according to Food-Info.

If the melting point is very high, the mixture will feel waxy.

If it is too low, it doesn't store well and separates.

First
 decision: milk or plain? They opted for dark chocolate with a 65 per 
cent cocoa content, the logic being that it contained the best fat 
composition to stay solid. And in any case, it tastes rather good. Then a
 pukka-looking teapot, short and stout, was crafted in a silicone mould.
 The pot had a large opening at the lid to let the initial waft of steam
 escape quickly, and a hand-hollowed spout. The manufacturing process 
took just over two and a half hours. And then it was time for tea.

Filmed
 by a crew from BBC’s The One Show, presenter Marty Jopson poured 
freshly boiled water into the pot and added a couple of teabags. The 
good news: it didn’t immediately melt. As the tea brewed for the 
requisite two minutes, Mr Costello reflected on the challenge and 
admitted: ‘We thought we would probably end up with chocolate tea.’

But
 he added: ‘Interestingly, if you pour the water in a certain way and 
you don’t stir inside, the chocolate on the inside of the shell melts 
but doesn’t move anywhere. So you get a very, very small amount of 
residue coming up to the top.’

In
 a moment of great triumph, the tea was poured into a cup and sampled. 
Verdict: it tasted like tea, with a hint of chocolate. Now… where’s that
 inflatable dartboard?

Tasting the final brew, the team concluded it was a good cup of tea with a slight hint of chocolate.

The scientists built up a series of layers using a silicon mould to create the teapot in a process that took around two hours. The finished product (pictured) has a large lid and very thick spout
