A father-of-two was arrested in front of his children after a mix-up over his phone number led to him being wrongly investigated for fraud.

Robert Turner was thrown into police cells for nearly three hours after a morning arrest at his home in Throop, Dorset last month.

After weeks of waiting, he was told he would not face charges earlier this month.

He believes the mistaken arrest was due to him being given a 'recycled' phone number when he switched to Virgin Media last year.

Robert Turner was arrested in front of his eight-year-old daughter Megan after he was investigated for fraud because of a mix-up with his 'recycled' phone number

Mr Turner switched to the company from BT last year and was promptly given a new number by his new landline supplier.

He then started receiving mysterious phone calls from debt collectors for a business completely unknown to him.

He said: 'We were getting six, seven or more calls a day. There were calls from debt collectors demanding money.'

Mr Turner found his new number listed on a website for a company and tried to contact them to ask them to remove it, without success.

Mr Turner believes his arrest was due to him being given a 'recycled' number when he switched telephone companies last year

He says he called Virgin Media a number of times but there were long delays to having his number changed.

He said: 'They just said nothing could be done unless the company removed the number from its website and advised me it could be identity theft.'

Describing his arrest, which took place on December 14, he said: 'I had just done breakfast for my girls when the door went at 8.45am.

'They told me I was under arrest for fraudulent representation. I was still in my dressing gown and my eight-year-old daughter was stood next to me.

'Then they followed me upstairs to get dressed. It was humiliating.' 

Mr Turner said police told him his telephone number had been registered to a debit card which had made four fraudulent transactions. However, his name and address were not registered to the card.

After weeks with the arrest hanging over him, he was told on January 7 that he would not face charges.

He said he does not blame police for investigating but was angry with Virgin Media.

A spokesman for Virgin Media said they do 'recycle' phone numbers of former customers but only after a certain period of time had lapsed.

The spokesman said: '(Mr Turner) signed up to the company in May 2014 and did not register for a number change until October.

'Mr Turner's account was in arrears when he first requested his number changed. Once paid he declined our offer to do this for several months. We supplied his account file (to him) as requested.'

Dorset Police declined to comment on the case.
