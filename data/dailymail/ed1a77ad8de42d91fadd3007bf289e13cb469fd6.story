The former Hollywood home of Marlon Brando is on sale for a whopping £2.3million ($3.5million). It might not be On The Waterfront, but to buy this it you'll have to make an offer the agents can't refuse.

The Godfather and Last Tango in Paris actor's stunning home has panoramic views over Sunset Strip and Los Angeles.

Built in 1926, the Spanish-Mediterranean three-bed was revived by AF Leicht - once dubbed 'LA's quirkiest dead architect'. The dramatic, winding staircase and the wrought iron balcony give the house a massive dose of Old Hollywood glamour.

The 4,363-square-foot house boasts three and a half bathrooms, flying buttresses and a red-tiled roof.

Unsurprisingly for an A-list pad, there's a castle-like art studio perched above the master bedroom, which completes the upstairs.

The magical Maison Marlon comes complete with a wine cellar with pebble floor, two-car garage and chauffeur's quarters.
