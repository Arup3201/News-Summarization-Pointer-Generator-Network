Conor McGregor doesn't just fight a good fight, he talks one too.

The Irishman's rise and rise in the UFC has been accompanied by a charm offensive outside the Octagon.

And, as he prepares to face Dennis Siver in Boston on Sunday, Sportsmail brings you a selection of his best quips and one-liners. 

UFC CEO Lorenzo Fertitta this week went so far as to compare him to the greatest, Muhammad Ali.

He said: 'I hate even saying this, but with his gift of gab and his athletic ability and fighting ability, it’s almost like the Irish Muhammad Ali in a way.'

The featherweight sensation goes into the fight against Siver - he headlines UFC Fight Night 59 - this weekend fresh from announcing a deal with Reebok.

McGregor is arguably one of the biggest stars of UFC and joins a roster of stellar names already sporting the Reebok brand in the Octagon: Ronda Rousey, Anthony Pettis, Jon Jones and Johnny Hendricks.
