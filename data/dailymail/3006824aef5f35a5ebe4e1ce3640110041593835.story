David Cameron will pay a historic visit to Burma this week – the first by a Western leader since decades of military rule ended last year.

The Prime Minister will signal Britain’s support for the political thaw in the former colony by meeting with Nobel Prize winner and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, 66.

Miss Suu Kyi, who spent 15 of the past 22 years locked up by the former junta, won a seat in parliament for the first time in by-elections a week ago, seen by the Foreign Office as a step in the right direction for the repressive regime.

Mr Cameron will also meet reformist president Thein Sein, who sanctioned elections in which Miss Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy, won 43 of the 44 available seats.

His visit follows confidence-building visits by Foreign Secretary William Hague, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell.

The Prime Minister is expected to tell Burma’s rulers that Britain will argue for economic sanctions on the country to be gradually lifted – but only if they continue their transition to a democracy.

The country is now run by a nominally civilian government, but it is heavily stacked with former military personnel, many of whom are opposed to further liberalisation.

Downing Street had hoped to keep the visit secret until Mr  Cameron’s arrival but information was released yesterday by the Burmese Government and the NLD.

The trip will cap a week-long trade mission to the Far East in which the Prime Minister will try to get his premiership back on track.

Mr Cameron, who is being  accompanied by 35 British leaders, will today look to boost trade  during talks in Japan with Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda.

He will announce new Japanese investment deals, including one with Nissan worth more than £200million, creating almost 1,500 new jobs in the UK and safeguarding thousands more.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Nissan’s  investment in the UK is a huge vote of confidence in the skills and  flexibility of our workforce.’
