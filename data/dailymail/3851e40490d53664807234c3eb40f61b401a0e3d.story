A driver facing criminal charges for the breakneck 24-minute lap around Manhattan he recorded and posted online rebuffed a plea offer Tuesday involving two months in jail for a stunt seen widely online.

Adam Tang, 32, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor, stemming from his September arrest and then asked the judge to reinstate his revoked driver's license and passport.

The judge agreed with prosecutors who decried the request and Tang remained without a license.

Need for speed: Adam Tang, seen here at his September arrest, is allegedly Afroduck--the YouTube user who recorded and uploaded his reckless and record-breaking 24-minute race around the island of Manhattan

'He videotaped himself circumnavigating Manhattan at a high rate of speed. He admits doing this,' Prosecutor Mary Weisgerber told Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Jill Konviser. 'He certainly should not have his license back.'

A dashboard-camera video showed a BMW making a 26.4-mile loop around Manhattan in 24 minutes and 7 seconds.

The New York Daily News notes that Tang allegedly told police he was Afroduck--the name used on the YouTube video account that made the footage famous--as well as other incriminating admissions.

'I can consistently do it in 24 minutes. I have done it in 24 minutes before, without a camera,' he said. 'I think I could do it in 19 minutes.'

'I have gotten speeding tickets in the
 past. I have also had accidents,' court papers say he blabbed. 'I am a 
car fanatic. I enjoy driving.'

Defense
 lawyer Gregory Gomez says there's no proof Tang acted recklessly. Tang 
told authorities he never went over 100 mph and ran only one red light. 
The video shows the car stopping for six others.

'A jury will find what he did was not reckless,' Gomez told the Daily News.

They're off! The 32-year-old Canada native allegedly began his breakneck race at 116th street in East Harlem

Fast: The video then shows the BMW hurtle past the Williamsburg, Manhattan, and Brooklyn Bridges, before tearing through the Battery Park Tunnel and around the downtown tip of the island to beat an earlier 2010 record of 26 minutes, three seconds

While still anonymous, the driver behind the video gave a revealing interview to car enthusiast blog Jalopnik, saying: 'I was always in control. In fact, this wasn't the first time I broke the record'

Gomez says the Canadian-born Tang wants to avoid any criminal record because of possible immigration complications.

After news of the stunt made headlines in September, NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly declared war on Afroduck, and made it a priority to track him down.

The high-speed journey in a manual 2006 BMW Z4, begins at FDR/East Side Drive at 116th Street, just outside of Harlem, with Tan weaving through traffic, undertaking moving cars at breakneck speed.

He then hurtles past the Williamsburg, Manhattan, and Brooklyn Bridges, before tearing through the Battery Park Tunnel and around the downtown tip of the island to beat an earlier 2010 record of 26 minutes, three seconds.

While still anonymous, the driver behind the video gave a revealing interview to car enthusiast blog Jalopnik in August.

'I was always in control. In fact, this wasn't the first time I broke the record. I can do it consistently under 24 minutes and most likely beat my own record again,' he told the blog.

He also invited anyone to try and beat his record.

Risky business: Tang asked the judge Tuesday if he could have his license back, which she denied. The Canadian citizen is also facing possible visa revocation if convicted of felony reckless driving
