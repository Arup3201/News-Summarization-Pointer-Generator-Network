Prosecutors said Monday that they won't charge a Texas couple in the death of a 3-year-old adopted boy from Russia, a case that has become the latest flashpoint in the debate over whether American families should be allowed to adopt Russian children.

Ector County District Attorney Bobby Bland said his office would not charge Alan and Laura Shatto in the Jan. 21 death of Max Alan Shatto, who was born Maxim Kuzmin.

'The grand jury determined there was insufficient evidence to charge them with anything,' Bland said at a news conference.

Autopsy: The medical examiner ruled that the death of Max Shatto was an accident

Accused: Kremlin accused Laura Shatto, right, of beating little Max, left, to death in January

Laura Shatto told authorities she 
found Max unresponsive outside their Gardendale, Texas, home while he 
was playing with his younger brother, Ector County Sheriff Mark 
Donaldson has said.

The boy was pronounced dead at a hospital a short 
time later. Preliminary autopsy results indicated Shatto had bruises on 
several parts of his body, though four doctors reviewing the final 
autopsy result ruled his death to be accidental.

Bland, the top prosecutor in Ector 
County, about 350 miles west of Dallas, previously said that the bruises
on Max's body appeared to be self-inflicted, and that no drugs were 
found in Max's system.

Russian authorities and state-run 
media have blamed the Shattos for Max's death and used the case as 
justification for a recently enacted ban on all American adoptions of 
Russian children.

Parents: The boy's adoptive parents, Alan and Laura Shatto, denied knowing about the allegations being made by Russian authorities. No arrests have been made

Tragedy: Max Shatto, 3, died last month after being adopted by a family in Texas. Russian authorities are claiming he was abused

Russian born: Maxim was born the town of Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia. The boy lived with a family in Gardendale, Texas with his family before his death

Russia's Investigative Committee has said it has 
opened its own investigation. It's unclear whether the committee could 
charge the Shatto family or force their prosecution.

U.S. State Department officials and adoption agency advocates have called for caution.

The Russian government passed the ban
in December in retaliation for a new U.S. law targeting alleged Russian
human-rights violators.

The ban also reflects lingering resentment over
the perceived mistreatment of some of the 60,000 children Americans 
have adopted over the last two decades. At least 20 of those children 
have died, and reports of abuse have garnered attention in Russia.

Protests: This woman holds a sign that reads 'Juvenile judiciary. Give us parents back!' Demonstrators walked along Moscow streets to support the new law prohibiting the adoption of Russian children by Americans

Rally: Activists from pro-Kremlin children's advocacy groups march through Moscow, demanding the return of an adopted boy whose brother, Max Shatto, died in Texas

Foreign Ministry official Konstantin 
Dolgov has called Max's death 'yet another case of inhuman treatment of a
Russian child adopted by American parents.'

Texas Child Protective Services 
spokesman Patrick Crimmins said the agency was investigating allegations
that Max was subject to physical abuse and neglect but had not 
determined whether those allegations were true.

The agency that 
processed the Shattos' adoption, the Gladney Center for Adoption in Fort
Worth, was cleared in a separate state investigation to find out 
whether it followed all guidelines.

The Shattos adopted Max and his 
biological half-brother, 2-year-old Kristopher, from the same orphanage 
in western Russia. Since Max's death, Kristopher has remained with his 
adoptive parents.

Russian state media have interviewed the
boys' biological mother, Yulia Kuzmina, who lost custody over 
negligence and serious drinking problems.

In a tightly choreographed Feb. 21 
interview on state television, Kuzmina insisted that Russian custody 
officials seized her children unfairly and said that she wanted to be 
reunited with her other son, born Kirill Kuzmin.

She said she had given 
up drinking, found a job and pledged to fight to get the boy back.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's 
spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has said it is necessary 'to temper emotions' 
over the case, and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul has called 
for 'sensational exploitations of human tragedy to end and for 
professional work between our two countries to grow, on this issue and 
many others.'

Russia's Investigative Committee said that it had opened an 
investigation into the little boy's death.

'Three-year-old Maxim was beaten, 
according to the investigators, by his adoptive mother, who fed him 
psychoactive drugs over a long period of time, saying that he had some 
psychiatric illness,' said Pavel Astakhov, the Russian Children's Rights
Commissioner alleges, according toÂ The Telegraph.

Plea: In a tightly choreographed interview, Max's biological mother, 23-year-old Yulia Kuzmina, tearfully appealed to President Putin to have her surviving son returned to her

Accusations: Pavel Astakho has alleged that Maxim was beaten to death by his American mother. American authorities have not confirmed the allegations are still investigating

Look of love: Alan Shatto embraces his son, Maxim, in this photo. Max's parents wrote in his obituary, 'When we get to Heaven, we know we will hear your sweet voice singing with the angels. We love you and will always miss you'
