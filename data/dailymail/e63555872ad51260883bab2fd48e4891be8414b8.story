The revelations are acutely embarrassing for Lord Mervyn King, who was governor throughout the crisis before stepping down in 2013

The extraordinary complacency of the Bank of England in the run-up to the financial crisis has been laid bare in records of secret meetings held between officials.

They reveal how blundering officials in the Bank’s ‘Court’ – its inner circle of regulators, executives and independent directors including former governor Mervyn King – grossly underestimated the scale of the impending meltdown.

Damning revelations include how Sir Callum McCarthy, the former chairman of the Financial Services Authority and a member of the Court, described the UK banking system as ‘sound’ just two days before the run on Northern Rock in September 2007.

Sir Callum also played down the financial problems at the stricken Newcastle lender, praising its ‘good quality loan book’ on the day before the run on the bank.

Two months later, officials on the Court dismissed the prospect of a full-blown banking crisis, with minutes of a meeting recording that ‘they do not perceive this as a likely scenario’.

The minutes of crisis talks held behind closed doors in Threadneedle Street, in the heart of the City of London, have been published today for the first time, after the Bank agreed to publish them as part of reforms designed to make it more transparent under new governor Mark Carney.

The revelations are acutely embarrassing for Lord King, who was governor throughout the crisis before stepping down in 2013.

The records, dated between June 2007 and May 2009, also reveal how the Bank chose to award its staff 5.5 per cent pay rises and bonuses just weeks after the near collapse of Northern Rock.

Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Commons Treasury Committee, accused directors in the Bank’s Court of being ‘cheerleaders’ who failed to the ‘provide an effective challenge’ to the executive headed by Lord King.

He said: ‘The executive rarely acknowledged possible weaknesses in its views or, other than grudgingly, admitted that it might have been unprepared for the crisis.’ Mr Tyrie also accused the Court of ‘back-covering’ in the heat of the meltdown, after failing to pay enough attention to the warning signs.

Mr Carney described the financial crisis as a ‘turning point in the Bank’s history’, adding the minutes provide ‘further insight into the Bank’s actions during this exceptional period’. But the papers show officials were slow to recognise the scale of the problem, even as Northern Rock teetered on the brink of collapse.

In a meeting convened on September 12, 2007, the day before Northern Rock submitted a formal request for an emergency loan, Sir Callum emphasised that the ‘UK banking system was sound’.

The following evening, an emergency meeting was called as the BBC’s then-business editor Robert Peston broke the news that the bank had applied for the loan.

Again Sir Callum appeared to underestimate the scale of the problems pointing out that Northern Rock only had a small exposure to risky ‘sub-prime’ loans, was well capitalised and ‘had a good quality loan book’.

The full scale of the crisis and the potential threat to other UK banks appeared to dawn on Bank officials only following the collapse of US bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008. ‘The crisis had become much more serious,’ the records of an October 2008 meeting state. ‘Some of the UK’s largest banks were facing failure without intervention and the complete seizure of the banking system threatened.’

But records also showed officials were pleased with how they had responded to the problems in the financial system.

‘There was now a real sense that a corner had been turned and the Bank could be proud of its work and contribution … the disease was no longer life threatening but recovery would take time.’ 

ALEX BRUMMER'S ANALYSIS: This utterly breath-taking complacency

There has always been an air of mystery surrounding the secrets buried inside the temple of the Bank of England. So today’s release of extensive minutes from the Court, the Bank’s governing body, covering the period of the 2007-09 banking crisis, is an event in itself. It effectively marks the end of 320 years of confidentiality.

Running to more than 500 pages, the papers show that far from being an effective watchdog for the Bank during the most gripping crisis for a century, the Court was largely a resting place for the great and good of the establishment who were rarely prepared to tackle all-powerful governor Mervyn King and his colleagues on issues of national importance.

In fact the Court was not formally told about several billion pounds of emergency loans made to Northern Rock (under what is known as the ‘lender of the last resort’ facility) until the rescue had been leaked to the BBC, prompting a public run on deposits that proved an enormous embarrassment to Gordon Brown’s government.

The overwhelming message from the Court’s minutes, which detail the view of King and his colleagues, is one of enormous complacency.

The initial problems of Northern Rock had been caused not just by the bank’s rash lending practices, such as the notorious 120 per cent mortgage, but by the freeze in the credit markets where banks lend to each other. Yet there appears to have been little awareness of this among the Court members or for that matter from the governor and his top deputies. The credit crunch was an arrow aimed not just at a few smaller banks but at the whole financial system.

King dispatched a paper to Downing Street in March 2008 arguing that piecemeal rescues of UK banks would not be enough

The Bank remained more concerned about its work in controlling inflation than an earthquake in the money markets, where banks lend to each other, that would eventually bring the whole financial system tumbling down and unleash the deepest recession in modern British history.

The smugness of the Bank and the key regulator, the since abolished Financial Services Authority, was at times breathtaking.

At a time when Northern Rock was dominating the national agenda, the chairman of the FSA Sir Callum McCarthy gently informed his colleagues on the Court that ‘the UK banking system was sound’.

He could not have been more wrong. Within months the Bank of England was secretly keeping Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS afloat with £61.6billion of covert loans designed to stop cash machines from seizing up.

Reality was that King and his colleagues may not have been sharing their concerns with the Court because of paranoia about leaks. But behind the scenes the Bank was preparing for the worst.

On March 17, 2008, King dispatched a paper to Downing Street arguing that piecemeal rescues of UK banks would not be enough and what was needed was wholesale recapitalisation with the Bank-Government taking share stakes in all the major banks.

The governor, however, did not share this view with the Court until October 15, after the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers brought the global capitalist system to the brink. It was only then that Bank officials explained to the Court the ‘traumatic events’ for financial markets in the wake of the Lehman collapse.

King’s memo to Downing Street is of enormous significance because it takes some of the shine off then-prime minister Brown’s later claim to have ‘saved the world’. In his memoir Beyond The Crash, Brown claims to have invented the idea of a recapitalisation, as a means of saving the UK banks, on a returning flight from Washington in September 2008.

It now seems it was King who came up with the concept six months earlier.
