Police say a Memphis, Tennessee teacher locked a 5-year-old girl in a closet, then left the school because she was feeling sick.

Shelby County Schools says the teacher, Kristin Ohsfeldt, has been suspended.

According to police, the teacher at A.B. Hill Elementary locked up the kindergarten student Akeelah Joseph on Tuesday and then went home sick without telling anyone where she was.

Poor 5-year-old Akeelah was stuck in the closet for an hour before anyone was able to find her

The teacher, Kristin Oshfeldt, has locked other children in the closet before, said children at the school

A substitute teacher didn't the discover the cold and frightened girl until an hour later.

Police say the child was not harmed and the teacher was not at the school when police arrived.

WREG interviewed Akeelah about the traumatic event. They asked her why the teacher had locked her in the closet.

'I was playing too much,' said Akeelah. 'I almost peed on myself if I didn’t make it the bathroom.'

Akeelah's mother, Wanda Joseph, told reporters this is the first time her daughter has gotten in trouble at school.

'I am hearing that the teacher locked my child in a closet, because she was supposedly bad. You don’t do that. I hurried up to the school and started yelling, ‘Where my daughter at? Where my daughter at?’' said Joseph. 'She was cold. She came out cold and shaking. Plus she has asthma. She could have had an asthma attack in that closet!'

Akeelah could have had a potentially threatening asthma attack and no one would have been able to find her.

This may have been the first time Akeelah got in trouble but its not the first time that the teacher has locked kids in the closet, according to children at the school.

Akeelah is afraid to return to school.

Akeelah's mother Wanda Joseph is horrified and thinks the teacher should lose her job

So far the teacher has been suspended from the school and no other charges have been filed

'She really liked her teacher, but I didn’t know she would do her like that, do a child like that, put someone in a closet,' said Joseph.

Wanda Joesph believes that the teacher should be fired from the school.

'The principal is going to talk to her and see what happened. Then he is going to send what happened to the Board of Education, and then see if they are going to suspend her or fire her. I think she needs to lose her job over that,' said Joseph.

Police and school officials are investigating. No charges had been filed as of Wednesday afternoon

The Department of Child Services has been notified.
