The mother of a diplomat killed during a terrorist raid on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi has blamed President Barack Obama for her son’s death.

Sean Smith was killed along with ambassador Chris Stevens and security men - both former U.S. Navy SEALS - Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods by terrorists in Libya on the 11th anniversary of 9/11 this year.

The families of three of the victims are divided in their reactions to reports that American personnel were refused help, despite several requests.

While Sean’s mother Patricia Smith has said that the president ‘murdered her son’ and Mr Woods’ father has echoed her sentiment, Mr Doherty’s brother has said that civilians could not comment on military tactics with any credibility.

Mrs Smith, 72 told the U-T San Diego: ‘I believe that Obama murdered my son.’

She said that her son was a strong supporter of Obama.

In an interview with Jon Stewart on Comedy Central last month Obama responded to a question about his administration's confused communication after the assault by saying: 'If four Americans get killed, it’s not optimal.'

'Guilty of murder': Charles Woods (right), the father of Tyrone Woods (left), the former U.S. Navy SEAL who died in the attack, condemned U.S. officials' decisions during the incident

In response, speaking exclusively to 
MailOnline last month, Mrs Smith from San Diego said: 'It was a disrespectful thing
 to say and I don't think it's right. 

'How
 can you say somebody being killed is not very optimal? I don't think 
the President has the right idea of the English language.'

Charles Woods, the father of 41-year-old Mr Woods condemned U.S. officials’ decisions during the attack on Fox News.

Wrong to blame Obama: Barbara Doherty (right), the mother of Greg Doherty (left) who also died during the attack while working as a security contractor said it was 'wrong to use these brave men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama'

He said:  ‘I’m a retired attorney, and I know that these actions legally do not constitute murder but in my mind the people in the White House, all of them who have authority to send in reinforcements to prevent what they knew was going to be the death of my son, are guilty of murdering my son.’

He later told the U-T San Diego: ‘I don’t want this to become political and become dishonouring to Ty.’

Greg Doherty, the older brother of former Navy SEAL Mr Doherty, who was working as an American security contractor, said that the pair responded to the attack and that they rescued people during the assault.

He said: ‘They had enough people to fight off that battle.

‘I don’t think it is civilians’ job to pick apart an actual battle and talk strategy unless you are a general.'

Mr Doherty said people were just looking for ways to point the blame at President Obama.

His mother, Barbara Doherty told Fox News: ‘It’s wrong to use these brave men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama.’

In the interview Stewart asked Obama: 'Is part of the investigation helping the communication between these divisions? Not just what happened in Benghazi, but what happened within.

'Because I would say, even you would admit, it was not the optimal response, at least to the American people, as far as all of us being on the same page.'

Obama responded: 'Here's what I’ll say. If four Americans get killed, it’s not optimal.'

He said: 'We’re going to fix it. All 
of it. And what happens, during the course of a presidency, is that the 
government is a big operation and any given time something screws up and
 you make sure that you find out what’s broken and you fix it. 

'Whatever
 else I have done throughout the course of my presidency the one thing 
that I’ve been absolutely clear about is that America’s security comes, 
and the American people need to know exactly how I make decisions when 
it comes to war, peace, security, and protecting Americans. 

'And they will continue to get that over the next four years of my presidency.'

Anniversary of 9/11: The embassy in Benghazi was left gutted after the attack done by terrorists in Libya on the 11th anniversary of 9/11 this year

The word 'optimal' was first used by Stewart in the question but Obama's use of it, in a sound bite that could be used to portray him as somewhat casual about the deaths, lit up conservatives on the internet after it was first reported in a White House pool report by Mike Memoli of the Los Angeles Times.

It recently emerged that the U.S. government was told that the attack had been carried out by militants, not a spontaneous mob, within just 24 hours of its taking place.

A diplomatic cable sent the day after the raid suggested that militants had previously planned to attack the consulate, and used the excuse of protests against the anti-Muslim video as cover for their assault.

It is unclear who, if anyone, saw the cable outside the CIA at that point and how high up in the agency the information went.

But the statement directly contradicts the explanation of the attack given by the administration over the following two weeks.

The debate comes as the presidential election campaign heats up as Election Day, on November 6, draws closer.
