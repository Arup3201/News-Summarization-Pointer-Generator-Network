The agent of Manchester United and Chelsea target Fredy Guarin has refuted claims his client asked for a transfer away from Inter Milan during the summer transfer window.

Reports had suggested that Guarin, who was also being chased by last season's Champions League winners Real Madrid, was keen on leaving the San Siro after his January move to Juventus fell through at the 11th hour.

However Guarin's agent Marcelo Ferreyra has insisted the midfielder is content with life at Inter Milan.

Ferreyra, speaking to Calciomercato.com, said on Guarin's future at the Serie A giants: 'I want to make it clear that Guarin never requested a transfer.

'Fredy is happy at Inter, always has been and will continue to be. We are absolutely not thinking about the transfer market.

'Fredy has everything he wants at Inter and has no need to go elsewhere. From what I hear, the offers were received by Inter. Walter Mazzarri will get the best out of him, just as he did last year.'

Guarin, who played for Colombia against Brazil during the early hours of Saturday morning, signed a deal to extend his stay at Inter Milan until 2017 in March.
