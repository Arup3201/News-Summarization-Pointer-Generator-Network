A Congressman's aide has admitted it was a 'mistake' when an obscene and bizarre message about Japanese food was sent from the Representative's account.

Democrat Keith Ellison retweeted an image of slices of meat frying on the top of an oven, with no pan, accompanied by the words: 'hell yeah benihana up in this b****'.

The culinary disaster was actually cooked and tweeted more than seven weeks ago by a man called Michael Hudson, but was then sent out to Mr Ellison's 56,500 followers on Sunday.

'Hell yeah Benihana up in this b****': Democrat Keith Ellison's account sent out this crude tweet on Sunday night

Mr Ellison deleted the tweet within 25 seconds, but by then it was too late. He has since admitted a 'mistake'

The Representative deleted the tweet within 25 seconds, but it had already been logged by a user who collates all messages from Congress, according to the Daily Dot.

Mr Ellison's aide, Isi Kirshner-Breen, apologized yesterday evening for the offending tweet.

He said: 'The tweet deleted from @keithellison last night was my mistake. For the record, I love Benihana.'

Benihana, a Japanese food chain, has 116 restaurants around the world, including at least three in Minnesota - where Mr Ellison represents.

A spokesman for Minnesota Democrats said: 'It was an aide and it was a mistake. The Congressman had nothing to do with it.'

Mr Ellison's aide apologized for sending the bizarre tweet, but admitted he does love Benihana

Can't cook: The original tweet was sent out in late June by Michael Hudson, who ate the chicken afterwards

Mr Hudson, the 'chef' who claims in his Twitter profile to be the 'Nephew of Slash, star of hit lacrosse movie Crooked Arrows', sent out the picture on June 23.

The grim cooking image was retweeted more than 11,000 times, even though some were unsure what the man was cooking.

One user, tweeting under the name sizzlingfajita, said to Mr Hudson: 'i have 2 questions: 1) is that chicken or fish 2) did you eat that [sic]'

He replied: 'chicken. Yes.'
