Two men have appeared in court charged with causing the death of an 18-year-old woman after a minibus carrying a hen party crashed on the motorway.

Bethany Jones died and many of her friends and family were seriously injured when the bus collided with a lorry on the M62 in West Yorkshire last April.

Bride-to-be Stefanie Firth, 24, was among the 21 people seriously injured in the crash, including Miss Jones’s mother and sister.

Accused: Minibus driver James Johnson, 62 (left) and lorry driver Kevin Ollerhead, 44, arrive at Wakefield Magistrates' Court  charged with causing death by dangerous driving after a crash on the M62 last year

James Johnson, who was driving the minibus, and Kevin Ollerhead, who was driving the lorry, both appeared at Wakefield Magistrates’ Court today.

Johnson, 62, from Bradford, and Ollerhead, 44, from St Helens on Merseyside, both stood as the charge of causing death by dangerous driving was put to them in front of a packed courtroom.

No pleas were entered in the five-minute 
hearing and Deputy District Judge Philip Holden told both men the case 
could only be dealt with at crown court.

It is understood the minibus turned onto its side after leaving the main carriageway and 
going up a slip road when it collided with a Farmfoods lorry driving in 
the same direction.

Scene: It is understood the minibus turned onto its side after leaving the main carriageway and going up a slip road when it collided with a Farmfoods lorry driving in the same direction.

The defendants, who were both smartly dressed in suits and ties, spoke only to give their names and personal details.

Miss Jones was with a group of women heading for a hen party in Liverpool when the minibus collided with the lorry and overturned on the M62 at junction 32, near Pontefract.

Several of the injured women 
were airlifted to hospital. The nursing student, who was in her first year at Leeds University, died at the scene.

Johnson and Ollerhead were given unconditional bail and told to appear at Leeds Crown Court on February 3.

United in grief: Injured friends of Bethany Jones attended her funeral in their wheelchairs
