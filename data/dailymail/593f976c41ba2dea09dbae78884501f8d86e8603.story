Leeds United are taking the unprecedented step of temporarily closing their training ground at Thorp Arch as part of attempts by new owner Massimo Cellino to cut the club’s costs.

United, who are losing around £1million a month, will shut the complex near Wetherby in North Yorkshire from the start of next week with the intention of reopening it again when their first-team squad report back for pre-season training at the end of June.

Drastic: Massimo Cellino has taken the step in a bid to arrest spiralling costs at the Yorkshire club

The club’s senior players and coaching team are beginning their summer holidays after finishing the Championship term last weekend, and a number of other non-playing staff will relocate to Elland Road for the close season.

Leeds' academy squads have a number of fixtures remaining and are expected to fulfill them as planned, despite the closure of Thorp Arch.

Physiotherapy and medical staff normally remain at the training ground during the summer but they will be based at Elland Road, too.
