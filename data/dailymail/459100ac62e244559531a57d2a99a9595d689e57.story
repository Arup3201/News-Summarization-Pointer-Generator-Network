She is Britain's richest women with a £7.4bn fortune, a £100m super yacht and the title of former Miss UK to her name. But that isn't enough for ambitious Kirsty Bertarelli.

The 41-year-old, who is listed as the UK's richest woman, is set to launch her own singing career too.

The wife of Swiss biotech magnate Ernesto Bertarelli has announced she will be releasing an album titled Love Is - a collection of songs inspired by her musings of 'real life'.

Each song is influenced by her jet-setting lifestyle with Ernesto, an America’s Cup-winning sailor.

Bertarelli is no stranger to the music world. She wrote the number one hit Black Coffee for girl band All Saints back in 2000.

She also wrote club track Hands High, which was a huge hit, playing endlessly on Radio 1’s Dance Anthems show.

She made her UK stage debut in July 2010 when she
supported Mick Hucknall and Simply Red at Edinburgh Castle, where she added some
glamour to the evening wearing a one-shoulder studded mini dress and 
matching boots.

And now, three years down the line as she 
gets set to launch her album, she is extremely confident that her music 
will touch fans on a personal level.

Speaking to The Independent, she said: 'I get inspired by life. My songs are all from real experiences and observations.

'If something moves me, it compels me to write about it. It’s important to write from the heart.'

Bringing a touch of glamour: Kirsty Bertarelli opened for Mick Hucknall and Simply Red at Edinburgh Castle in 2010 and now she is back to take the music world by storm

Born to a 
well-off family from the village of Stone in Staffordshire, she attended boarding school 
before pursuing a career as a model.

She was crowned Miss UK in 1988 and went on to take third place in the 1989 Miss World pageant.

The beauty queen 
eventually met her husband on the London party circuit and the pair 
married in Gstaad in 2000.

They now share their time between 
a plush home in London's Knightsbridge, Lake Geneva in Switzerland and setting sail on their yacht in the sunny Caribbean with their three children.

The beauty queen and her Swiss husband recently splashed out on the biggest motor yacht ever built in the UK.

The pair had the massive 96-metre, six-deck Vava II 
built to replace their existing 47-metre vessel at a cost of an 
incredible £100m.

The 
superyacht, the 33rd largest in the world, was built in Plymouth and 
boasts luxury interiors, a helicopter landing pad, lavish guest cabins 
and four boats to ferry passengers to shore.

And while she may be a part of the super privileged jet-setting pack, Kirsty maintains that she is still just a humble girl from Staffordshire deep down - and she wants her fans to know this.

'I’m from Staffordshire and I’ve been very fortunate but I’m the same girl I used to be. I feel elation and sometimes pain like everyone else and that’s what I draw on in my songwriting.'
