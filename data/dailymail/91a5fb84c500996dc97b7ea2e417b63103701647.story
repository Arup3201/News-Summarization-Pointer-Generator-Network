A 13-year-old girl who's recently won high praise and widespread media attention for her breakthrough ecological research stole her findings, says a Florida scientist.

Dr. Zack Jud wants credit where credit's due -- to him, after he says sixth-grader Lauren Arrington pinched his findings about the habitat of invasive lionfish.

Meanwhile, Lauren's father -- who happens to be best friends with Jud's former supervisor -- says his daughter's name is being dragged through the mud by a frustrated academic.

'This has been one of the most disappointing experiences in my academic career': Dr. Zack Jud says he's had enough of seeing media report after media report about the 'breakthrough' findings about lionfish made by a sixth grade girl fir her science fair project

Lauded: Lauren Arrington, whose father is good friends with Jud's former boss, became a media darling after she made what ecologists saw as breakthrough research about the venomous and invasive lionfish as part of her sixth grade science fair project

That 
frustration may come from the fact that Jud, who's recently graduated 
with his Ph.D. from Florida International University, has indeed 
dedicated a great deal of his career to researching the lionfish.

However,
 it's Lauren who's showing up on television and across the internet 
after her work was cited in a scientific journal. Lauren's story has 
appeared on NPR, CBS, and NBC among others.

'My
 name has been intentionally left out of the stories, replaced by the 
name of the 12-year-old daughter of my former supervisor’s best friend,'
 Jud wrote on Facebook. 'The little girl did a science fair project based on my 
PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED DISCOVERY of lionfish living in low-salinity 
estuarine habitats.'

To Jud's credit, Lauren attended his lectures on lionfish as she was doing
 her own research two years ago for her sixth grade science project.

She also cited Jud's work in her report, notes the Washington Post.

Lauren's
 claim is not to have discovered lionfish can live in less saline 
environments, says her father, but it's that she took Jud's work to the 
next step by determining just how fresh water can be before the fish 
will die.

I thought we were friends: Lauren's dad says his daughter's feelings are hurt by Jud's accusations and says the little girl merely took Jud's findings a step further

'Clearly she did not discover lionfish were in the estuary,' Lauren's father Albrey Arrington told the Washington Post. 'Lauren predicted experimentally how far up the estuary they could invade.'

Arrington says he even has proof that Jud was himself shocked by Lauren's findings, which she made by changing the salinity inside tanks holding the venomous fish, in the form of emails.

'Craig (Layman, Jud's former boss and Mr. Arrington's friend) told me about the 6 ppt feeding, but I didn’t know she ramped them back up to 27 ppt in 2 hours with no ill effects,' Jud wrote in 2012, according to an e-mail shared with The Washington Post. 'That’s crazy.'

Jud explains away this by saying he tends to 'overstate the excitement and importance of kids’ discoveries' in order to encourage them.

At least one outlet that previously publicized Lauren's accomplishment has since apologized to Jud, who nonetheless appears to see the damage as done.

'This has been one of the most disappointing experiences in my academic career,' he said.

Neither is 13-year-old Lauren unscathed by the acrimony.

'When I first kind of told my daughter what was happening,' Arrington said, 'she looked at me honestly with a confused look and said, "I thought Dr. Jud and I were friends.’”

Lionfish: The venomous, fast-breeding fish is taking over reefs up and don the East Coast. Research shows it could also be miles up our rivers thanks to a previously unknown ability to survive in nearly fresh water

Lionfish, a tropical native of the Indian and Pacific oceans likely introduced through the pet trade, have been colonizing swaths of the Caribbean and Atlantic for years - from the U.S. Eastern Seaboard and the hard-hit Bahamas to the Gulf of Mexico.

The a striped saltwater species with a flowing mane of venomous spines, damage reefs and devour native fish, and they are eaten only by sharks — or larger lionfish.

They have been such a worrying problem that divers in the Caribbean and Florida are encouraged to capture them whenever they can to protect reefs and native marine life already burdened by pollution, overfishing and the effects of climate change.

Across the region, governments, conservation groups and dive shops have been sponsoring fishing tournaments and other efforts to go after slow-swimming lionfish to try and stave off an already severe crisis. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration launched a campaign in 2010 urging the U.S. public to 'eat sustainable, eat lionfish!'

But just because shallow waters hugging coastlines have seen declines, the fast-breeding species is hardly on the way out. Fat, football-sized lionfish are daily caught in fishing pots set in deeper waters that spear fishermen and recreational divers never see.
