A crackdown on unlicensed taxi drivers in New York has accidentally snared the chauffeurs of a Qatari prince, a fashion billionaire and a Canadian TV star.

The drivers had their cars impounded by Taxi and Limousine Commission investigators - forcing their super-rich bosses to walk or hail a yellow cab like everybody else.

DNA Info New York reports that all three drivers were able to get their vehicles back - and the charges against them dismissed - after proving that they weren't working a taxi drivers - but as personal chauffeurs.

Last September, city inspectors stopped Ibrahim Senturk in his Chevrolet Suburban as he was driving across Manhattan. In his backseat: one of the sons of Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, who was at the time the Emir of Qatar and one of the richest monarchs in the world.

The seizure of the car left the prince stranded at East 53rd Street and Third Avenue, along with a friend.

It's unclear which of Sheikh Hamad's 11 sons was in the car at the time, but the seizure of according to DNA Info.

Senturk later argued that he was employed by the Qatari consulate in New York and was working for the prince when he was stopped. A judge threw out the charges and returned the SUV to him.

Sheik Hamad ruled Qatar until he stopped 
down earlier this year. He is worth an estimated $2.4billion, but was in
 charge of his oil-rich nation's $170billion sovereign wealth fund.

Last November, Hong Kong billionaire Silas Chou found himself without a chauffeur or a ride when Taxi and Limo inspectors stopped his Rafal Czubek as Mr Chou was getting out of the car on East 52nd Street and Fifth Avenue.

Despite Mr Czubeck's protests that Mr Chou was paying him $60 an hour to be his chauffeur and personal assistant, inspectors seized his Cadillac Escalade.

Officials were forced to give it back after a judge threw out the charges when Mr Czubeck appealed and said he helped look after the 'high-maintenance' Mr Chou, according to court records obtained by DNA Info.

Mr Chou, who owns Tommy Hilfiger and Michael Kors, is one of the richest men in Hong Kong  - with an empire worth up to $2.4billion.

Earlier this year, police also seized the car belonging to the personal assistant to Michael Wekerle, a Canadian banker worth up to $95million.

Wekerle also plays one of the venture capitalists on Dragon's Den, the Canadian version of the reality show Shark Tank.

The assistant was charged at JFK International Airport. The charges against were dropped in March.
