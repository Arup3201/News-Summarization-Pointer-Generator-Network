A dead soldier's family has hit out at the 'serious failings' of an officer in charge of an exercise in which he was found to have been unlawfully killed.

Ranger Michael Maguire, 21, was shot dead as he ate his lunch in what was supposed to be a safe area at an Army training range in Castlemartin, Pembrokeshire.

He had taken his helmet off to eat a sandwich when he was hit in the temple by a stray machine gun bullet.

His brother Jimmy Maguire said the inquest left the family with unanswered questions over the 'planning, setting up and conducting' of the training exercise.

Shot: An inquest jury found Ranger Michael Maguire, who died after being shot as he stood in a 'safe' area at an Army training range, was unlawfully killed

The hearing was told that targets had
been set up in 'dangerous' positions half a mile from where soldiers 
were eating their lunch.

The
inquest heard Ranger Maguire - who was 6ft 7in and known as 'High 
Tower' - had taken off his helmet to eat his lunch with colleague Ranger
Matthew Hewitt.

Ranger Hewitt said: 'I was smoking a cigarette and he was eating his lunch when the rounds started coming. I could hear the sound of live weapons being fired from close by.

'Michael
commented they sounded too close. He looked round to see where the 
noise was coming from and then he fell to the ground. I realised immediately he had been hit, but I couldn’t believe it - it all happened in a split second.'

The soldier was airlifted to a hospital in Cardiff where he was pronounced dead.

Lieutenant Jonathan Price, the range 
conducting officer, passed the training course which allowed him to take
charge of the exercises on the day Ranger Maguire was killed last May.

But
just nine months before, the inquest heard, course tutors had 
recommended he receive extra supervision due to perceived weaknesses in 
his understanding of the course.

Lt Price went on to make a series of mistakes in the planning and carrying out of the live fire exercises.

The conducting officer told the inquest he was unaware of his shortcomings and finished the course 'quite happy'.

'We
note the verdict that the jury has reached, which reflects the very 
serious failings of the range conducting officer in the planning, 
setting up and conducting of this training exercise,' said Jimmy Maguire.

'The inquest heard that he was a competent person, qualified to conduct this exercise.

'We
are surprised and puzzled how somebody could have been considered 
competent to conduct an exercise of this nature when at the same time he
made so many fundamental errors, and how this could not have been 
picked up through the chain of command and at the range.

'We
are left wondering how someone with such limited experience could have 
been put in charge of the training exercise and the range with no senior
officer present and without appropriate supervision,' Mr Maguire added.

Forensic scientist Andre Horne said the bullet had left the gun at 680mph, missed the target and travelled more than a kilometre over sand dunes before striking Ranger Maguire.

Ranger Peter Jones, who fired the fatal bullet, told the hearing he was unaware that Ranger Maguire was in the line of fire.

'If I’d known there were people in line with the target, I would never have fired,' he said.

The inquest in Cardiff heard the targets on the range had been set up incorrectly, leading to bullets being fired in 'dangerous' directions.

Captain Gary Palmer told the hearing: 'They were firing in a dangerous direction.

'The targets should have been to the West and not to the North. It was in a dangerous position.'

Ranger Maguire, from Bantry in Cork, Ireland, joined the 1st Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment in 2010 and was sent to Afghanistan four months later.

The inquest heard the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.

After a day of deliberations the jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing.

Cardiff Coroner Miss Mary Hassell said: 'The jury have asked me to pass on their condolences to Michael’s family.'

Mr Maguire said the family hoped lessons would be learned 'Army wide' as a result of his brother's death.

'We know that nothing can bring Mike back - our primary concern throughout this process has been that nothing like this ever happens again,' he said.

'Soldiers should not be killed in training and we hope lessons are learned Army wide.

'Mike was a dearly loved son and brother and he’s much missed by his family and everyone who knew him.

'Mike was a very well-liked member of his battalion who served in difficult conditions in Helmand Province. It makes it all the more ironic that he should lose his life on a training exercise in Wales,' his brother said.

Investigations by the Special Investigation Branch of the Royal Military Police and the Health and Safety Executive are continuing.
