The last friend to see British schoolteacher Lauren Patterson alive has spoken of her guilt at allowing her to get in a car with the men suspected of her murder.

Beautician Lea Monet had spent the evening with Lauren in a nightclub in Doha, Qatar, and the pair agreed to the offer of a lift home from two men they had been drinking with.

Miss Monet, 22, reluctantly got out of the car at her apartment, leaving  Miss Patterson with the men as the teacher insisted she was in  safe hands.

One of the men later sent a text message to Miss Monet, saying her friend was ‘all good’ – but hours later Lauren’s charred remains were discovered dumped in the desert.

It is believed the 24-year-old was stabbed to death at the home of one of the men. Her body was later burned beyond recognition.

Two men have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are expected to face the death penalty if convicted under sharia law.

Miss Monet, who is originally from France, described how last Saturday’s events unfolded after Miss Patterson, from Kent, returned to Qatar where she worked at the Newton British School in Doha.

She said: ‘After I had finished work on the Friday I went and picked Lauren up from Doha airport as she had been at her grandmother’s funeral in England.

‘We went back to her apartment and got changed to go out to a nightclub. She was really excited to be back and her boyfriend was due to fly out and see her the following week, so she was very happy.

‘We were listening to music and having some drinks before getting a taxi to Club 7, our favourite nightclub where we went every week.

‘Lauren was in a fantastic mood – she was singing, dancing and catching up with all her friends.

There were a group of men who we knew on the table next to us and they kept coming over to our table and giving us drinks.’

The women, who became best friends after meeting in March through mutual friends on Doha’s clubbing scene, left the nightclub at about 1am last Saturday with two of the men from the group.

Miss Monet said: ‘Lauren and I wanted to go home and went to get a taxi but one of the men, a tall black man, was being overly friendly and kept trying to put his arm around Lauren.

'Qatar is a very conservative country and I started shouting at him to stop it. We started walking away to a taxi but he called to us, “Why don’t you get in my car and I’ll give you a lift home?”

‘I said OK because we knew him. We used to see him and his mate each week at the nightclub.’ Miss Monet revealed that the pair asked the two men to be taken to Lauren’s apartment in the Gulf city.

But they stopped at Miss Monet’s apartment first and she got out. ‘Lauren said she would be fine and the three of them drove off,’ she said. ‘It is a decision I will regret for the rest of my life.’

Miss Monet texted the driver, whose name she does not want to reveal, asking if her friend had got home safely and he replied ‘Lauren is all good.’

But the next afternoon she still had not heard from her. Miss Monet met the driver next day to ask for an explanation and, noticing a cut on his lip, became suspicious and went to the police.

She said: ‘The next day they told me they had found Lauren’s remains in the desert.

‘When I heard, it was the worst feeling in the world. I can’t help but feel that I could have done something to stop it happening.

‘Part of me is still scared that friends of the men will come for me but I want to tell the world the truth about what happened.’

The alleged suspects are thought to have dug a pit in the desert which they filled with charcoal before pouring petrol on Lauren’s body and setting it alight and fleeing.

Due to the remoteness of the location, it is unlikely her remains would have been discovered  but for a local falconer who was in the area.

His bird of prey was attracted to the burning corpse and led him to it.

The falconer is understood to have alerted police, who hid in the sand dunes and pounced on a man when he appeared at the scene checking on the fire.

A Doha police source revealed that Miss Patterson’s body was so badly burned that it was reduced to ashes apart from a piece of her skull and her feet.

Police are expecting to make more arrests in connection with Miss Patterson’s murder and said the net was closing on their suspects.

Forensics have not been able to ascertain whether Miss Patterson was sexually assaulted or raped and a knife believed to have been the one used to kill her was found in the remains of the fire.

A mouth brace worn by Miss Patterson is also thought to have survived the blaze.

Because her body was badly burnt it has yet to be officially identified.

Miss Patterson’s boyfriend James Grima, an IT technician and DJ, was too upset to speak this week at the home in Malta he shares with twin brother Justin.

Miss Patterson’s mother, Alison, a reflexologist from Kent, has travelled to Doha.

She said: ‘Lauren had made so many friends. She loved travel and loved teaching, so this was the perfect job for her.

‘She recently had a job offer from another school in Hong Kong but turned it down because she liked it so much in Doha.

‘I will be staying in Doha for as long as it takes to see that justice is done for my daughter.’
