Arsene Wenger is set to hand David Ospina the chance to stake his claim for Arsenal’s No 1 jersey this weekend following Wojciech Szczesny’s double blunder against Southampton.

And Szczesny is facing a fresh fight to save his Gunners career with the club seeking a new goalkeeper for next season. Szczesny is expected to drop to the bench for Sunday’s FA Cup clash against Hull City, with Colombia international Ospina taking his place.

And Ospina has the chance to replace Szczesny as first-choice keeper until at least the end of the campaign if he performs well, starting in the re-run of last season’s FA Cup final.

This is not the first time Szczesny has been faced with such a situation during his time at the Emirates Stadium.

The Gunners looked into signing a new shot-stopper 18 months ago after an inconsistent season from Szczesny that saw him lose his place to Lukasz Fabianski, now at Swansea.

He was much more consistent last season, but the doubts from within the Arsenal backroom team are resurfacing. Chelsea keeper Petr Cech would interest Wenger, but the Blues would be reluctant to sell to a direct rival.

Meanwhile, Arsenal’s bit-part striker Lukas Podolski flew to Italy on Friday for talks with Inter Milan and will  sign a loan for the rest of the season on Saturday.
