A New Zealand church pastor has been slammed on social media for a 'shocking' and highly offensive email to a gay Christian man, calling him 'filthy' and telling him to kill himself.

Author Jim Marjoram emailed about 400 Auckland churches about his new book 'It's Life Jim' to promote gay-friendly religion which details his many years of struggle as a gay Christian.

A response by homophobic pastor Logan Robertson of the Westcity Bible Baptist Church in Auckland, was posted to Facebook and has created widespread anger among both religious and non religious people.

Pastor Robertson said in his email, 'we are not interested in your filthy lifestyle or book,' citing that the 'Bible clearly says God has rejected homos'.

'They (gay people) are worthy of death,' he went on to say, 'you can not be saved.'

After quoting the bible a couple of times, Pastor Robertson then continues to say, 'I pray that you will commit suicide, you filthy child molesting f**.'

While the abhorrent email has shocked and appalled many people, Mr Marjoram has taken the response in his stride.

'Got my first hate mail,' he wrote after posting the response to Facebook and his social forum on Reddit.

'Got this lovely reply this morning,' he said.

Mr Marjoram told One News TVNZ he doesn't feel any anger or hate towards the Pastor.

'The only thing I could say is what you're preaching isn't love,' he said.

'And if you call yourself a Christian... Jesus wouldn't go anywhere near that.'

When Daily Mail Australia rang Pastor Robertson for a response he said 'there was nothing really to say about it,' confirming everything he had written was what he believed.

'The Bible says gay people will die and go to hell,' he said.

'I don't agree with the lifestyle and the Bible condemns it.'

Asked if he was worried about all the backlash received from the email he simply said he 'didn't worry about it'.

Where the Westcity Bible Baptist Church in Auckland is. The church Pastor Logan Robertson has caused controversy after labelling gays 'filthy' and saying they should all go to hell

The pastor who has a bio on the church's website states he was born and raised in New Zealand and is grateful that he was raised in a loving Christian home.

It says he was saved as a young child and has been happily married for 8 years to wife, and the Lord has blessed them with three wonderful young children.

Clearly unfazed by questions that he was preaching ignorance and hate, Pastor Robertson said he couldn't change what he had written and stood by everything he said.

'All homosexuals are pedophiles, all fags are pedophiles, it's not offensive to me, you're either offended or you're not,' he said.

The pastor went on to quote several parts of the bible, as he did in his email.

Leviticus 20:13 reads 'If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.'

The email from Pastor Robertson has been slammed on social media

After the 'offensive' email was posted to Facebook, religious and non religious people came out in support of author Jim Marjoram 

The email by Pastor Logan Robertson caused widespread anger on social media

Some Facebook users labelled the email 'shocking'

New Zealand Pastor Logan Robertson has been widely criticised for his 'shocking' email to author Jim Marjoram

The Bible says you are vile, strange (queer), reprobate, filth, sodomite, natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed (2 Peter 2:12).

'The Bible never changes, it's the same every generation, the King James version, it's not offensive and I don't care what people think.'

Asked if he thought his congregation would be supportive of his tirade against the New Zealand author, he replied 'yes they would support it'.

He also gave his 'view' on what the gay population saying 99 per cent of people weren't gay, so gay people were a tiny minority citing the media is constantly 'trying to cram it down our throats, so it appears there are more gay people than there is'.

In New Zealand same sex marriage became legal in August last year, a law the pastor is definitely and not surprisingly against. 

'They pretend to get married (gay people), marriage is between a man and wife, god created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,' he said.

'The government should put them to death and I'm not calling them gay, because that means happy, they are f**s.' 

Author Jim Marjoram (pictured) posted the vile response on Facebook and his Reddit account and it has created a media storm of angry people to the comments

The email response has caused widespread anger on social media, both religious and non religious people backing the New Zealand author.

'People like him make hell right here on earth,' one user said on the Facebook post.

Another user, who admitted to being religious called the email 'shocking' and said 'the pastor needs to go back to Bible school'.

Others made a comment asking the author 'not to think he's part of mainstream Baptists in New Zealand, he's not'. 

Anglican priest Rod Bower, who is head of the Gosford Anglican church on the New South Wales Central Coast, north of Sydney, says this is 'unbelievably disgraceful'.

The father, who is well know for his stance on supporting the gay community and his irreverent and witty signs that often fly in the face of the traditional views, believes Mr Robertson is clearly in possession of a very limited biblical theology.

'While the biblical narrative does have a negative view of what we recognize as 'homosexual' behaviour, the writers have no concept of what we now understand as sexual orientation,' he said.

'Mostly where there is a negative view it has more to do with pagan worship and marital infidelity than it does with what we understand a homosexuality.'

A sign liked by Father Rod Bower

'The reference to Sodomy (Genesis 19) is again a misrepresentation of the text, as the sin of Sodom has nothing to do with homosexuality and everything to do with the denial of hospitality.'

'In this context Mr Robertson is more the Sodomite than Mr Marjoram. If Mr Robertson wishes to take the Bible seriously rather than literally (you can’t do both) he may wish to consider James 3:9-12.'

'With it (our tongue) we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God; from the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be this way. Does a fountain send out from the same opening both fresh and bitter water? Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a vine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce fresh.'

'Effectively Mr Robertson has sought to curse Mr Marjoram and the problem with that is curses have a nasty habit of bouncing back on you.'

'Mr Robertson is an embarrassment to the Christian faith and I wonder how much harm he has done to other people. Another biblical verse comes to mind, 'Jesus wept'.'
