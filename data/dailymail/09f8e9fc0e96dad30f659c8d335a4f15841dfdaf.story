Boss Neil Warnock would welcome a Crystal Palace takeover, but admits he is facing deja vu.

The Eagles drew 2-2 at West Brom on Saturday, having led 2-0, after reports linking American billionaire Josh Harris with the club emerged.

Harris is worth more than £1.25billion, according to the Forbes guide, and owns NBA franchise the Philadelphia 76ers and NHL side the New Jersey Devils.

Warnock was in charge at Leeds and QPR when they were sold, and knows the feeling after Palace were linked with a takeover.

'Yes, because it's happened many times,' he said. 'At Leeds it happened, at QPR there was a takeover and now Palace.

'But it is difficult for managers now. Every club would love a billionaire. There are not that many about - you have to snap their hand off.

'It must be lovely, but it brings a different kind of pressure, to be able to spend millions and get top players.

'It must be brilliant for any manager to spend millions and get to work with players like (Chelsea's Diego) Costa.

'I don't really know what a billionaire could do for Palace - I have only been here six weeks. You'd better ask the chairman. There are not a lot of billionaires in Yorkshire.'

Palace were 2-0 up at the break at The Hawthorns after Brede Hangeland's opener and Mile Jedinak's penalty.

Victor Anichebe made it 2-1 in the second half after Craig Dawson barged into Julian Speroni, leaving Warnock baffled as to why referee Mark Clattenburg did not award a foul.

It forced the goalkeeper off with a head injury and Clattenburg also failed to give Palace another first -half penalty when Dawson felled Wilfried Zaha.

Saido Berahino's stoppage-time spot-kick salvaged a point for the Baggies and denied the Eagles a third win of the season.

'I wanted to see the referee and I was told he was going to stay, but he didn't,' Warnock said. 'I saw (fourth official) Chris Foy and the others, but I am afraid Mark had gone.

'That was old-fashioned stuff, the smash on Speroni. The smash on (Jason) Puncheon by (James) Morrison (in the build-up to Albion's penalty) could easily have been a free-kick.'

He added: 'I came along to Palace to help them out really. They had lost their manager at a difficult stage of the season, so it has been nice to steady the ship.

'We have a good group of players here. I am going to make sure I enjoy it.'
