Moree farmer Ian Turnbull made verbal threats against Glen Turner two years before 'he deliberately executed him by shooting him in the back' a judge has said in court while refusing the wealthy grazier bail. 

'I'm an old man. I don't care. I can do anything I want' police say Turnbull told Mr Turner on June 28, 2012.

Turnbull is charged with the murder of the 51-year-old father of two, accused of shooting the environment officer during an alleged land clearing dispute, on a public road at Croppa Creek, near Moree in northern NSW.

Justice Anthony Blackmore said the threat to Mr Turner was said in the context of 'if you have any respect for your life you will not interfere'.

'I simply cracked,' Mr Turnbull told his wife Robeena, heard the court on Thursday. He told her as he sat on the verandah of their property and waited five hours for the police to come and arrest him

Turnbull sat defiantly with his arms folded as Justice Blackmore went further to say that he believed the farmer had 'considerable means' to leave the country and to live well.

He also said that he was still a threat to the community and to all officers working, as Mr Turner had been, for the Office of Environment and Heritage.

'He had threatened him [Turner] before and ultimately ends up shooting him.'

'He does have very significant financial means, much more than the ordinary person ... he is able to escape the jurisdiction and live out the rest of his life comfortably.'

'He is charged with the murder of a public official.'

'The facts of the case are virtually overwhelming,' said the judge.

Justice Blackmore said Turnbull had shown no remorse, telling a prison psychologist ' it was the deceased that was at fault'.

He said that 'moreover the dispute between [Turnbull and the environment department] is not over.

'He is a danger to all environment officers if released on bail. He is also a danger to the community.'

Compliance officer Glen Turner, 51,  was allegedly shot in the back by wealthy farmer Ian Turnbull. His wife Robeena June Turnbull told the court her husband said, 'I simply cracked'

Glen Turner, 51, was shot dead on a dirt road near Moree in northern NSW in the early evening of July 29

Ian Turnbull has been refused bail at the NSW supreme court on Thursday

'He deliberately threatened the deceased prior to the event.'

'What bail conditions could deter a mam who is prepared to execute a public official.'

On the evening the elderly farmer allegedly murdered the NSW environment officer, he went home and told his wife he 'simply cracked'.

He sat looking 'wretched ... just blank' after shooting Glen Turner on July 29, his wife Robeena told the Sydney court early on Thursday.

'I simply cracked,' he told her as he sat on the verandah of their property and waited five hours for the police to come and arrest him.

'I didn't mean to kill him',' Mrs Turnbull told the court her husband told her, adding 'he appeared as though he was somewhere else'.

Turnbull has been in custody since July 29, the day of the killing in the state's north. 

Robeena Turnbull, who has been married for more than 50 years to the 79-year-old, told a NSW Supreme Court bail hearing her husband arrived back at the family's homestead about 6.30pm.

He didn't shower or change his clothes, instead, he sat down in a chair and told her he was going to wait for the police, the court heard.

Glen Turner's family have been devastated by their loss 

Mrs Turnbull told the hearing that she had visited her husband in jail every weekend since his arrest, a 12-hour round trip that involves driving to Brisbane, where her son lives, flying to Newcastle and renting a car for the final leg to Cessnock Correctional Centre.

She said her husband had difficulty walking and that she could see he was in pain, adding he suffered from peripheral neuropathy, which meant he needed  a wheelchair in prison.

'He said he could only walk about 10 feet and then he would crumple to the floor,' Mrs Turnbull said.

'But (he only expresses discomfort) when I ask him. He doesn't come out complaining.'

The court heard that Turnbull would stay with relatives on Sydney's north shore if released on bail. 

At a previous court hearing, police had alleged the farmer was armed with a loaded rifle and had told Mr Turner he would be leaving Croppa Creek that day in a body bag.

Mr Turner was shot on a dirt road in the early evening as he and another environmental officer were carrying out unrelated duties on Talga Lane, near Moree. 

'I simply cracked,' Mr Turnbull told his wife Robeena (pictured), heard the court on Thursday. He told her as he sat on the verandah of their property and waited five hours for the police to come and arrest him

Turnbull, who appeared via audio visual link from Cessnock prison on Thursday dressed in prison greens, looked haggard and had his arms crossed.

He pressed his lips together and looked grim, occasionally glancing away from the camera as his wife gave evidence.

Prominent Sydney barrister, Tony Bellanto, QC, appeared for Mr Turnbull.

Mr Bellanto cited Mr Turnbull's medical conditions, including a pacemaker in his heart, chest pain, angina and difficulty in walking, as well as offering a $300,000 surety. 

Mr Turner and Ian Turnbull had been involved in a long-running dispute over land clearing in the area, where Turnbull and his family own several properties with large tracts of cropping land. 

Following the shooting, Mr Turner's family said they were devastated by his early passing and would remember him as a loving husband and father to his two young children, aged nine and 10. 

The incident generated widespread debate on native vegetation legislation, and came after years of mounting tension between farmers, environmentalists and governments about landowners' rights to clear vegetation for cropping.

A year before the fatal shooting, Turnbull had pleaded guilty to illegally bulldozing nearly 500ha of trees and was facing a hefty fine and a ­potential legal bill of more than $300,000.
