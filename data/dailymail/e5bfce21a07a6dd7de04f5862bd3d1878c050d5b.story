Muslims around the world are celebrating Islam's biggest holiday with prayers, gifts, traditional visits with family and friends, and feasts.

Eid al-Adha, or Feast of Sacrifice, commemorates what Muslims believe was Prophet Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son in accordance with God’s will, though in the end God provides him with a sheep to sacrifice instead.

In remembrance, Muslim faithful slaughter sheep, cattle, camels and other livestock in an act of sacrifice to show gratitude for their blessings, divide the meat into three equal portions and give some of it to the poor.

Palestinians from Gaza City pray inside the Dome of the Rock during their visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem

It was the first time since 2007 that Muslim worshippers from Gaza have been allowed to travel to the shrine, Islam's third holiest site

The visit to Islam’s third holiest site was granted after Israel eased tight restrictions for the three-day holiday of Eid al-Adha

The holiday held special significance for 500 elderly Gazans as they prayed at the Dome of the Rock at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem.

It was the first time since 2007 that Muslims from Gaza have been allowed to travel to the shrine, which is considered Islam's third holiest site.

The rare visit was granted after Israel eased tight restrictions for the holiday – a month after a ceasefire ended a two-month war – and the elderly Gazans were allowed to stay for several hours before they were driven back to the Gaza border.

Many hadn't visited the shrine in decades and they kissed the ground as they entered the sprawling plaza. 

Umm Dallaleh Fayyad, a woman in a black abaya and a vibrant blue headscarf, told Agence France-Presse: 'I haven't been here for 35 years. Everything has changed. It's like being in paradise.'

In addition to offering Eid prayers, gifts and social events are a central part of the holiday, which begins at the end of the hajj pilgrimage, with parents often buying new clothes for their children.

Because Eid follows the Muslim lunar calendar that depends on sightings of the moon, some Muslims began celebrating the three-day festival on Saturday.

Sunday marked the start of festivities for Iraqi Shiites and the majority of Indonesians in the world's most populous Muslim nation of 240 million. Pakistan will celebrate on Monday.

Saturday marked the first time since 1981 that both Muslims and Jews are celebrating major holidays at the same time.

Eid al-Adha coincides with the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur once every 33 years based on their lunar calendars.

Yom Kippur is Judaism's Day of Atonement, when devout Jews ask God to forgive them for their transgressions and refrain from eating and drinking, attending intense prayer services in synagogues. The holiday began at sunset Friday and ended Saturday night.
