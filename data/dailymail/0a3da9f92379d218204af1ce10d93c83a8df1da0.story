Coca Cola has come up with a revolutionary new kind of tin for its popular beverage that splits into two smaller containers to allow drinkers to share with a friend.

The Coke Sharing Can twists into two self-contained cans so you can share your drink without sharing your germs.

An advert encouraging customers to 'share happiness' shows how the regular-sized 330ml can can be split so that your pals need never go parched when you aren't.

It looks like a normal can, but...

Grab both ends and twist...

And pull to reveal two half-sized self-contained cans for you and a friend

The revolutionary idea could also help to combat obesity, with the guzzling of large quantities of sugary soft drinks often cited as a major reason why so many people are so fat.

'For years, Coke has encouraged people to share happiness—and has given them lots of surprising ways to share a Coke,' the company said in a statement.

'This time, they've taken the classic Coca-Cola 330ml can and designed it for two persons. Twist, turn and share—"yes", the Coca-Cola can itself.'

Advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather's offices in France and Singapore came up with the idea for an advert in the Far East city state.

Merely an advertising gimmick? Advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather's offices in France and Singapore came up with the idea for an advert in the Far East city state

Share the happiness: Limited quantities of the cans have been made available in Singapore, and the Coca-Cola Company has not said whether it will roll out the idea to other markets

Limited quantities of the cans have been made available in Singapore, and the Coca-Cola Company has not said whether it will roll out the idea to other markets.

Judging by the comments below the advert on YouTube, it may not be a roaring success.

Timothy Snyder wrote of the concept: 'Yeah... I would just drink both halves.'

Others lambasted the company for merely creating more potential waste for the same amount of product. 'Great job Coca-Cola, you have just created twice as much litter per can,' wrote Jack Richardson.
