The driver who struck and killed a fellow racer just three weeks ago is set to return to the track this weekend. 

Tony Stewart will return to Sprint Cup competition Sunday night at Atlanta Motor Speedway, ending a three-race hiatus taken after he struck and killed fellow driver Kevin Ward Jr. during a dirt-track race.

Stewart, 43, will also speak to the media for the first time since the incident this Friday.

Tony Stewart, 43, will return to the track to race this Sunday, just three weeks after killing a fellow driver

The three-time NASCAR champion has not raced since his car hit  Ward at an Aug. 9 sprint car event in upstate New York. Stewart pulled out of the NASCAR race at Watkins Glen the next morning, then skipped races at Michigan and Bristol Motor Speedway.

Stewart, who was described by police as "visibly shaken" the night of Ward's death, has been in seclusion ever since.

His only comment since the crash was a statement the day after  in which he said, 'there aren't words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that took the life of Kevin Ward Jr.'

Ward had climbed from his car after it had spun while racing for position with Stewart. The 20-year-old walked down onto the racing surface waving his arms in an apparent attempt to confront Stewart.

Authorities said the first car to pass Ward had to swerve to miss hitting him. The front of Stewart's car then appeared to clear Ward, but Ward was struck by the right rear tire and hurtled through the air. 

He died of blunt force trauma.

There is still a decision pending on whether Stewart will be charged in Ward's death. Ontario County Sheriff Philip Povero said Thursday the investigation is still ongoing. 

NASCAR released a statement saying that Stewart was eligible to return because he 'has received all necessary clearances required to return to all racing activities.' 

The racing organization then added that they would have no further comment until President Mike Helton speaks Friday afternoon.

Stewart, who has 48 career Cup wins in 542 starts, is one of the biggest stars in world of racing, and most of his peers have been protective of him as questions emerged in the aftermath of the crash.

Racer Paul Kinney, however, said while he didn't witness the shocking crash in New York on Aug. 9, he did drive past Ward moments before he was hit by Stewart and could 'clearly' see Ward on the track.

Since Ward's death, NASCAR has announced a rule that prohibits drivers from exiting from a crashed or disabled vehicle — unless it is on fire — until safety personnel arrive. 

Last week, Denny Hamlin crashed while leading at Bristol and stayed in his car until safety personnel arrived.
