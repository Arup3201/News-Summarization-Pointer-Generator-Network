Marketing synergy? Levine's turn as the new face of Obamacare comes shortly after down-market retailer Kmart unveiled a clothing line featuring his name -- and all the press certainly won't hurt sales

Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine, named the 'sexiest man alive' by People magazine in November, is joining a handful of B-list celebrities to promote the Affordable Care Act to millennials who are abandoning the new health insurance scheme in droves.

With a Harvard University poll showing this week that only 29 per cent of uninsured 18-to-29-year olds say they will definitely or likely to enroll in the new insurance marketplaces, the co-star of 'The Voice' is fronting a social media campaign designed to make Obamacare cool again.

According to an announcement from the state-based insurance exchanges in California and Connecticut, and the Enroll America activist organization, the campaign will also leverage aging TV star Fran Drescher, 'Harold and Kumar' film star Kal Penn, actress and R&B singer Tatyana Ali, Latin Grammy winner 'Pitbull' Perez, and Iman 'AlphaCat' Crosson, an impressionist best known for his impersonation of President Barack Obama.

Crosson recorded a spoof rap video, performing as the president, in conjunction with the program's launch.

'Don’t stand and diddle, my healthcare’s the shizzle,' he raps. 'It's chock full of top-notch healthcare provizzles. We’ll cover all your vizzles, your dizzles and your tizzles.'

The campaign, called 'Tell a Friend – Get Covered,' features an aggressive Twitter push focused on the hashtag #getcovered. The White House joined in on Thursday afternoon with a tweet of encouragement to young Americans by insisting that buying a medical insurance policy would 'give your mom piece [sic] of mind.'

CNBC correspondent Bertha Coombs fired back, tweeting, 'Your mom may want you to use #spellcheck in addition to #gettingcovered.'

Levine's tweets brought more digital guffaws.

'Tell A Friend - Get Covered' will officially launch Friday with a social media storm designed to attract millennials

Penn's first tweet in conjunction with the PR campaign was designed to appeal to the frat-boy set.

'Cover your dong, and you will live long,' he wrote. 'In fact, cover your whole sexy body. #GetCovered.'

Bloomberg reported that the program's goal is to make '100 million Internet contacts' with millennials before Obamacare's open enrollment period ends on March 31.

'The idea is a drumbeat of dialogue, a drumbeat of discussion about coverage – not about glitches, not about the politics, not about the pundits,' said Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, the state-based insurance exchange that spearheaded the campaign's launch.

It's also about the personalities, including Drescher's irritating, nasal-voiced nanny character from the 1990s.

'Like we say at Cancer Schmancer, "Take control of your body,"' she said in a statement on thursday.  'That's why I support Obamacare. Sign up and tell all your friends to sign up, too.'

Healthcare.gov had a rocky rollout and produced the online equivalent of millions of eye-rolls among tech-savvy young Americans, whom the Obama White House now hopes to woo back into the fold

The White House's model for the 
Affordable Care Act hinges on attracting enough young, healthy Americans
 – 40 per cent of total signups – to offset the cost of medical 
treatment for older, more illness-prone enrollees.

Levine, one of the co-hosts and judges on 'The Voice,' is the highest-profile celebrity the Obama administration and its allies have enlisted to date in their quest to right Obamacare's sinking ship

Early
 estimates suggest that enrollment totals among the younger population 
have totaled no more than 25 per cent. The Obama administration has 
refused to provide hard numbers of who makes up the roughly 
365,000-strong Obamacare risk pool so far, and how many of them have 
paid their first month's premiums.

Enroll America, the Obama-linked advocacy group that counsels uninsured Americans on how to enroll in new coverage, is part of the PR push.

Anne Filipic, the group's president and a former deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, told Bloomberg that the focus on star power is just 'a first step to raise awareness.'

Filipic was also Deputy Executive Director of the Democratic National Committee and served on Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' intergovernmental affairs staff during Obama's first term in office..

'We don’t think that, by seeing a tweet, suddenly millions of people will go get coverage,' she said. 'Adam Levine’s tweet helps us begin, and then we can have a substantive conservation about what’s available.'
