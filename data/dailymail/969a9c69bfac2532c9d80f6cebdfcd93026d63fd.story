A 21-year-old home-schooled computer expert from the Queensland town of Kingaroy - north-west of Brisbane - has been charged with possessing $110,000 of Bitcoins he allegedly obtained during a cyber attack police say he made on the giant US gaming site Riot Games.

Police allege Shane Stephen Duffy hacked into the game, League of Legends, which has more than 67 million players across the world, on a laptop at his mum's place in Kingaroy - otherwise known as the peanut capital of Australia. 

The charges against Duffy come after a combined investigation by a specialist police cyber crime and identity unit in tandem with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

In August 2013, Riot Games was forced to reset League of Legends player passwords in North America, causing widespread online fury. The company announced that 120,000 transaction records and credit card data had been stolen.

Online fury: Tens of thousands of players of League of Legends allegedly had to change their passwords and online security information after the game was disrupted by a hacking scheme

He is facing fraud and hacking charges related to League of Legends, which was created by US gaming giant, Riot Games.

Detectives from Queensland's Hi-tech Crime and Investigation Unit have now raided properties in the  towns of Kingaroy, Poona and Hervey Bay investigating the alleged computer offences.

Following the seizure of laptops and a hard drive in Kingaroy last November, Queensland police  spent several months forensically examining items and found others located within an 'encrypted container'.

Shane Duffy is due to face Maryborough Magistrates Court on July 22 on two counts of fraud by dishonestly obtaining property from another, one count of fraud by dishonestly causing detriment, one count of possessing equipment for the purpose of committing or facilitating the commission of an offence, and three counts of using restricted computers.

Outback hacker: Queensland cyber crime police says the case of alleged hacking of the giant gaming site League of Legends which investigators will tell a court next month originated in small town of Kingaroy, 210km north-west of Brisbane, showed that hackers did not have to own numerous computers and sophisticated equipment, but could just be a kid with a laptop living with his Mum

Bitcoin is a payment system which records financial transactions on a public ledger.

No actual tangible currency exists, however users of the system can send and receive bitcoins electronically in exchange for products, and services.

Although the legitimacy of bitcoins has been questioned and banking authorities warn it lacks consumer protections, it has grown in popularity as a form of payment.

One incentive to accept the digital currency is that its fees are lower than those of credit card companies.

He will also face Hervey Bay Magistrates Court on July 24 on charges of tainted property relating to the bitcoins and breach of bail offences.

Duffy, who has a Californian girlfriend he met online, is a computer genius but totally innocent according to his mother, Kingaroy beauty therapist Leah Duffy.

Ms Duffy has defended her son saying the Queensland Police had 'the wrong man'.

She said her son, who had been home-schooled since fourth year due to his suffering from Asperger syndrome, which caused him difficulty in normal social interactions, but allowed him to be highly skilled in introverted activities, such as in mathematics, Tech Times reported.

Since Duffy has been out of school, he stayed home most of the time and taught himself all about computers.Ms Duffy said her son indeed was a computer whiz and had more computer knowledge than Queensland's best cyber detective, but that he did not commit those cyber crimes.

She said any information Duffy had was readily available on the internet for free, and that it was someone else who had made the hacked database public.

Police alleged Duffy hacked the servers of Riot Games and was able to acquire player details and details on IP addresses, and sold them all online, which allowed players of Legend of Leagues to slow down their opponents' playing abilities which made them more vulnerable to being 'killed' or eliminated from the game.

Screenshots of the data were allegedly uploaded from Riot Games' Twitter account, allowing a profit of up to $1000 a week selling IP addresses.

Detective Superintendent Brian Hay of the Hi-tech Crime Investigation Unit said in April the case showed alleged hacking threats could originate anywhere, and were not necessarily a skilled hacker working with multiple computers an sophisticated equipment.

Earlier this year Duffy was denied access to computers as part of his bail conditions.

An application by Duffy in April to change his bail conditions because he needed computer access to speak to his girlfriend and complete a TAFE course was refused because of the seriousness of the nine charges.
