First they were accused of trying to cash in on the royal wedding, then they breached strict advertising laws surrounding the Olympics.

But this time, the Middletons seem to have offended an even more formidable foe: James Bond. Just days before the new Bond film, Skyfall, was released, their party company was advertising apparently unlicensed 007 merchandise, urging online shoppers to throw their own ‘secret agent’ event.

The Party Pieces website featured an advert dedicated to the movie, complete with the James Bond Skyfall logo, its release date and an iconic black and white picture of the film’s star, Daniel Craig, seen through the barrel of a gun.

But the Middletons’ keenness to make money out of the phenomenon appears to have raised eyebrows among the legendary Broccoli family, who not only produce the Bond films but own – and jealously guard – all product, image and merchandising rights.

A spokesman for their UK-based firm, Eon Productions, told the Mail they were aware who owned Party Pieces, set up in 1987 by the Duchess of Cambridge’s mother, Carole Middleton.

They said the issue had been passed on to the marketing and legal department – meaning that Party Pieces is very likely to be unlicensed to thrill.

Eon Productions was founded by Albert R. Broccoli, who died in 1996.

It is now owned by his daughter, Barbara Broccoli, and stepson, Michael G. Wilson, who also produce the Bond films.

The spokesman added: ‘It is not something we comment on but the film makers are very protective of everything they have built up.

'It is something we take very seriously.’

The offending advert: It has now been removed from the website

The situation is particularly awkward as the Duchess of Cambridge’s father-in-law, the Prince of Wales, and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, were guests of honour at the royal world premiere of Skyfall last week, where they met Daniel Craig and the Bond cast as well as Miss Broccoli.

Hours after the Mail contacted Party Pieces and Eon Productions on Friday, the offending banner disappeared from the company’s website.

But it is not clear whether the removal of the advert was the result of any threatened legal action from the Bond producers, as Party Pieces did not respond to a request for comment.

The goods, which are still available, are listed under the heading ‘James Bond Secret Agent Party’.

They include a £3.99 table centrepiece made up of two paper martini glasses and a stiletto shoe, and tuxedo-shaped gift boxes for 50p each.

The firm also sells ‘0’ and ‘7’ silver helium balloons at £6.99 each, and gold plastic martini party glasses for £1.49 a pop.

It is not the first time that the Duchess of Cambridge’s family has run into trouble over marketing issues.

Earlier this year they were asked to amend their website after falling foul of strict advertising laws covering the London Olympics with a range of Games-themed goods.

They were also accused by Britain’s Got Talent of illegally carrying its logo on their website and criticised for cashing in on the royal wedding with a range of themed items including corgi cake toppers and British trivia scratch cards.

Although the business’s accounts are not publicly available, the firm is clearly a money-spinner for the Middletons, who recently bought a £4.7million country home and have put their three children through private school.

It is a remarkable achievement for Mrs Middleton, who started the business from scratch by making party bags around her kitchen table.
