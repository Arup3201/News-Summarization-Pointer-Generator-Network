It has been revealed that a staggering $428 million has been paid out in settlements for civil-rights lawsuits brought against the NYPD since 2009

New York City taxpayers have shelled out nearly half a billion dollars in NYPD-related settlements over the past five years.

It has been revealed that a staggering $428 million has been paid out in settlements for civil-rights lawsuits brought against the NYPD since 2009.

The information was brought to light in response to a Freedom of Information Law request filed by open government news organization MuckRock.

The results show not only sheer amount spent on the 12,000 plus settlements but also that the overwhelming majority of these cases end with the NYPD at fault, MuckRock noted.

But this is not to say that all the settlements were solely prompted by the police department's actions.

As Gothamist pointed out, The largest settlement on the list, $11.5 million, resulted from the case of Google engineer Sasha Blair-Goldensohn, who was hit and partially paralyzed by a falling tree limb in Central Park in 2009.

In another case the family of Ronald Spear sued the City after Spear died on Rikers Island after being beaten by Correction officers, receiving $2.75 million in their settlement.

The weblog also noted that the $428 million figure may not accurately reflect what New York is actually paying out.

It refers to the case of John Gad Alla who won a $2.5 million settlement from a jury after he was beaten by NYPD officers in his home in 2010. But last year a federal judge reduced that amount by $1.5 million and ordered a new trial.

The average settlement amount costs  $33,875.

The Gothamist last year met protester Jed Meighan, who said he was living off the settlement he obtained from the City after being pushed to the ground by a group of NYPD officers during an Occupy Wall Street protest in 2012. He broke his wrist and later received $55,000.

The document also shows that the City paid out $583,024 to a group of 14 Occupy Wall Street protesters who were arrested on New Year's Day in 2012, which is the largest OWS-related settlement to date.
