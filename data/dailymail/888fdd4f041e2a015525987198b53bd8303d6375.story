Factors contributing to the state's status as the worst for working women were not limited to wage but included issues of economics, health and leadership in 2013, according to 27/7 Wall Street.

 1. Utah

 2. Wyoming

 3. Idaho

 4. Mississippi

 5. North Dakota 

 6. Montana  

 7. South Dakota  

 8. Indiana

 9. Alabama

10. Kansas  

The wild west is no place for working women, according to a survey that says Wyoming, Utah and Idaho are the worst states for females in the workplace.   

The wage gap is not the only challenge working women face today in America. 24/7 Wall Street recently ranked the 10 states that they say are the worst for working women. 

The list chronicles how working women in the US fare between the states in terms of the gender wage gap, the poverty rate among women, the percent of women in the state's legislature, and the infant mortality rate in each state. 

Utah was number one on the list making it the worst state for working women. Women in Utah made 70 percent of what men earned last year, nearly the largest pay gap in the country. 

On average, women make 79 cents for every dollar a male makes in the workforce, though this varies across the states.

Women in the state were reportedly less likely to hold leadership roles and there is very little female presence in the state's legislature.

Utah may have been the worst, but  seven of the 10 states: they are all west of the Mississippi River.

Utah: Utah was listed as the worst state for working women. The state shows a substantial wage gap and very little female presence in state politics

The western states on the list  had a poverty rate for women of above 15 percent and all had an infant mortality rate of above 6 percent. Four of the seven western states on the list lacked family-friendly and female-friendly health policies in the workplace, according to 24/7 Wall Street.

These states have gained the status as the worst for working women, but four of those seven states have among the highest percent of female presence in state legislature. 

This list is based on a 2013 report by The American Association of University Women

1. New York: 86 cents per dollar

2. Maryland: 85 cents per dollar

3. Florida: 84 cents per dollar

4. California: 84 cents per dollar

5. Arizona: 84 cents per dollar

6. Hawaii: 83 cents per dollar

7. Nevada: 83 cents per dollar

8. Vermont: 83 cents per dollar

9. North Carolina: 83 cents per dollar

10. Georgia: 83 cents per dollar

This list is based on a 2013 report by The American Association of University Women

1. Louisiana: 66 cents per dollar

2. Wyoming: 69 cents per dollar

3. West Virginia: 69 cents per dollar 

4. Utah: 70 cents per dollar

5. North Dakota: 70 cents per dollar

6. Montana: 74 cents per dollar

7. Indiana: 74 cents per dollar

8. Nebraska: 74 cents per dollar 

9. Oklahoma: 75 cents per dollar

10. South Dakota: 75 cents per dollar 

Ariane Hegewisch, study director at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, told 24/7 that women are not only discriminated against in pay, but also lack career opportunities that are available to men.

The list was determined by looking into three major categories: leadership, economy, and health, according to 24/7.  

On the list, Wyoming had the biggest wage gap with women making only 69 cents for every dollar a man made. 24/7 found that, on average, working women in Wyoming earned $35,829 a year, which is slightly lower that the U.S. median of $37,791 as of 2012. Men, on the other hand, had among the highest yearly earnings nationwide making close to $52,000.

Challenges: Ariane Hegewisch, study director at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, said that wage discrepancies are not the only challenges working women in America face

Alabama and Kansas tied with the smallest wage gap on the list, working women in both states earn 79 cents for every male earned dollar. However, Alabama is not faring well in measures of health that impact woman, 24/7 reports. 

The life expectancy of Alabama women is 78.2 percent as of 2010, one of the lowest in the country. The state reportedly lacks family-friendly workplace health policies and has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the country with 9.2 deaths per 1,000 living births. 

While women reportedly earned 80 percent of a man's salary last year, the poverty rate among women in the U.S. is a factor contributing to states that are the worst for working women.

Mississippi had the highest poverty rate on the list with 26.6 percent and Wyoming had the lowest with 12.1 percent. A 2012 report from the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that women are more likely than men to be poor.

The 2013 report by the Center for American Progress 'The State of Women in America' reports that women, as a whole, made great advancements in 2012 with a record number of women running for office and women making great progress in issues of health in economics.

However, that is women in America as a whole, the state's on the list contrast greatly in each state legislature's female presence. 

The highest percent of women in state legislature on the list is Montana with more than 27 percent of the state's political leaders being women. Alabama had the lowest percent on the list with only 14.3 percent.

The states had noticeable contrasting statistics, however, many of them had one thing in common: measures of health.

Idaho, North Dakota, Montana, and South Dakota all lacked some aspect of family-friendly or female-friendly healthcare, 24/7 reports. 

Half: Today, women make up almost half of the United State's workforce, a great improvement from 1969 when women made up only one-third of it

Inequalities: In recent years, women have made great advancements and have even stepped up to lead the country, but substantial inequalities remain

Nearly 16 percent of women in Montana didn't have healthcare last year, and 24/7 reports that it has among the nation's worst access to health services. Working women in South Dakota reportedly cannot take paid time off to tend to their own health or pregnancy and North Dakota doesn't require employers to offer paid maternity leave to employees. 

Both Idaho and South Dakota officials have decided not to expand Medicaid benefits allowed under the Affordable Care Act. 

Issues contributing to these state's status as being the worst for working women include more than just wage. Other factors contribute to the status of working women in the states. 

Today, women make up almost half of the United State's workforce, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, a great improvement from 1969 when women made up only one-third of it. And, in recent years, women have made great advancements and have even stepped up to lead the country, the Center for American Progress reports.

However, substantial inequalities remain. There is still more work to be done. Not only on a national level, but on a state level as well.

The gender wage gap was not the only factor in determining these states, issues of health, economics, and leadership also played a role
