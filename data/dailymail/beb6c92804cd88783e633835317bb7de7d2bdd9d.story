Mes que un botin. More than a boot. And here, in this latest multi-million pound adidas ad campaign, Lionel Messi is more than a player too... he transforms into a tiger!

The man who missed out on World Cup glory during Argentina's final defeat by Germany in Rio last month, returns to Barcelona training on Tuesday.

Messi will join up with Dani Alves, Andres Iniesta, Xavi and Co at Barcelona's La Masia training base as he begins his pre-season training following a break.

As his team-mates were hard at work at St George's Park last week, the 27-year-old was unwinding after his Rio heartache on a beach break in Capri with girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo.

But Messi, who won the Golden Ball prize in Brazil despite Argentina's agonising extra-time upset, is back in Barcelona and is keen to flash off his new golden boots.

In the film, Messi comes to life from a wall mural and interrupts a group playing football.

After lacing up his boots, he bursts through the Catalan streets with a ball at his feet, racing through the traffic before morphing into a tiger until he reaches his Nou Camp destination.

It is there where he will wear his latest signature adizero F50 boots that have been designed as a celebration to every goal, record and trophy Messi has won in his career to date.

He will wear the striking colour during La Liga games only, with Barca's season-opener against Elche on August 24 one to look forward to.

The Argentine superstar will lace-up an alternative, as yet unreleased, boot especially for Champions League matches this season.

They are not the only adidas boots to cause a stir, however. The German sports brand, who recently announced a £750million kit deal with Manchester United starting in 2015/16, released blackout versions of their classic Copa Mundials.

The iconic boots, famed for being worn by some of the game's legends including Franz Beckenbauer, Michel Platini and Franco Baresi, are also being sold in white along with updated versions of the Predator and F50 studs that could be seen in the Premier League this season.
