The Senator who sparked an internal revolt against Prime Minister is refusing to comment about what took place when Tony Abbott arrived late to a scheduled party room meeting.

The PM reportedly scheduled a last-minute visit to a cancer research centre so he could 'justify' charging Australian taxpayers for a trip to Melbourne to attend a private function the night before.

Mr Abbott was an hour late to the meeting of Liberal and National MPs on Tuesday and, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, explained his tardiness by telling the them he had to schedule an official visit to the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre to justify being in the city under entitlements.

The private function held on Monday night was a fundraiser for the Liberal party.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten claims these revelations show that Tony Abbott is not fit to govern the country.

'What is most telling about these reports is that there are Liberal Party members leaking against the Prime Minister,' Mr Shorten said.

'A party and a leader that cannot govern itself cannot govern Australia.'

He also said that the Prime Minister should 'never need an excuse to visit a public hospital in Australia'.

At the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Mr Abbott made no new policy announcements, and told journalists he was there to talk about the government's proposed Medical Research Future Fund.

Senator Ian Macdonald, who reportedly took the Prime Minister to task in front of colleagues for his late arrival, issued a statement this afternoon, insisting he would not be making any specific comments about what took place in the party room meeting.

't’s a long-standing convention of the Party that we do not comment on, or describe, anything that might be said in the Party Room,' Senator Macdonald said.

'The reason for that is obvious. It allows Members and Senators to speak frankly in what are often robust and beneficial exchanges with Ministers and the Leadership Group. It allows input from backbenchers into the policy debate of the Coalition.'

But Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull has disputed the report that Mr Abbott told MPs he was late in order to justify being in Melbourne for a fundraiser.

'He didn't say that to the party room,' Mr Turnbull told ABC radio on Wednesday.

'Tony was quite upfront and said he had been in Melbourne and he had been to a fundraiser the night before.'

Asked if Mr Abbott had said he scheduled the visit so he could justify billing taxpayers, Mr Turnbull said: 'I don't recall him saying that, no'.

A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister confirmed that Mr Abbott attended a private fundraising function in Melbourne on Monday night.

'All prime-ministerial travel is undertaken within entitlement,' she told the Herald.

'Whenever the Prime Minister travels he maximises his visits by ensuring he participates in community events, business visits and local media.'

On Wednesday, parliamentary secretary Steve Ciobo defended the prime minister against what he described as 'slurs'.

'It is crystal clear the prime minister attends events right across the community in a range of areas and there's also a long-standing commitment to medical research,' he told reporters in Canberra.

'It is an absurd proposition to suggest the prime minister is doing anything other than remaining focused as he has been over many, many years to advancing medical research in Australia.'
