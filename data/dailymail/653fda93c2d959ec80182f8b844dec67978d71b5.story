A Filipino mayor, his wife, another family member and her toddler son were brazenly gunned down Friday morning by police uniform-wearing assassins.

Ukol Talumpa, his wife Lea, 25-year-old relative Saripuddin Talumpa and toddler Philip Thomas Estuesta were attacked outside the busy Manila Ninoy Aquino International Airport  Friday morning as they awaited a ride from a family member. Four others were also injured.

The gunmen were wearing police uniforms and riding motorcycles when they pumped the family full of bullets before speeding away just after 11:15am, according to ABS-CBN News. This was the third attempt on the politician’s life.

The four shooting victims were rushed to a nearby air force base where they were declared dead on arrival, ABS-CBN reported.

Mr Talumpa and his relatives arrived at the airport, the country’s largest, at around 10am at a flight from Zamboanga del Sur, according to ABS-CBN. He is the mayor of Labangan, a town of just under 40,000 people in the southern state.

Local media reports have witnesses claiming the daring assault was carried out by two police uniform-wearing gunmen on motorcycles.

They approached the mayor and his family, shooting them dead at close range with a .45-caliber pistol, airport manager Jose Honrado told Reuters.

Terrified bystanders ran and dove for cover, a video posted to Instagram showed the dead body of at least one person lying motionless on the ground.

‘We are still investigating the motive,’ he added, declining to comment any further.

A MailOnline call to Mr Honrado's office went unanswered.

A local official claimed a perimeter of checkpoints has been set up around the airport and officials are actively searching for the suspects.

A Solar News report shows puddles of blood and evidence markers cordoning off shell casings at the scene – just outside terminal three.

Four other people were also injured in the horrific attack but have yet to be named. Relatives of Mr Talumpa who survived the attack refused to comment to multiple news outlets.

The assassination comes just a year after Mr Talumpa won a tight race for the mayor’s seat after serving as the deputy mayor, AFP reported.

This was not the first attempt on the mayor’s life.

An attempt last year saw a would-be assassin lob a live grenade at Mr Talumpa’s car, according to ABS-CBN.

The grenade exploded near the then-vice-mayor’s car while he was inside with his wife and another relative. A police officer outside the vehicle was the only one injured in the attack.

In a November 2010 attempt, gunmen ambushed the mayor and two of his children after they hopped in an SUV outside a Manila condo. Mr Talumpa and his driver were injured in that attack, according to ABS-CBN.

Friday’s assassination took place in an airport named after Benigno Aqunio, a prominent opposition politician who was shot dead in 1983 upon arrival.
