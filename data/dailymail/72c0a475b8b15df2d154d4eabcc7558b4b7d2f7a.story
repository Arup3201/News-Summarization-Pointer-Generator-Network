Gerard Deulofeu says he'd rather play for Stoke than Real Madrid.

The Barcelona midfielder spent last season on loan at Everton but has returned to the Nou Camp.

Asked at a Nike event in Andorra whether he would prefer to play in the Premier League with Stoke or Real Madrid in Spain, he replied: 'In Stoke'.

The 20-year-old also revealed that his year at Goodison helped him mature as a person and player.

'As a player, I've learned [what can] cost me [in] defensive aspects. Its has been very helpful. Until you're out and you have no family, [different] food, the weather - you do not know what you have and you learn to value things.'

Deulofeu, who was not part of Spain's World Cup squad, is confident of playing regularly this season despite having to compete with Lionel Messi, Neymar and most likely Luis Suarez too.

He said: 'Yes, they are the best players, but I am very confident in myself, I think much of my chances and I work every day hoping to get my challenges.'
