Paramedics who discovered a dead student had to call police after thieves descended on the flat and began stealing his belongings.

The ambulance operatives found Menelik Beckford, 23, lying face down in bed at his south London flat where he appeared to have been dead for some time.

But while they were steal examining him, looters forced their way into the property and began taking what they could.

A fearful paramedic called for police back up, an inquest at Southwark Coroner's Court heard.

PC David Heffernon, of Brixton Police Station, told the hearing: 'I was spoken to by a paramedic who was already at the scene.

'He wanted police assistance because while they were there at the address people were coming and going and taking things and he felt scared.'

Mr Beckford was found in a state of rigor mortis at the address on Vining Street, Brixton, after paramedics were alerted by a friend.

The police initially treated the case as suspicious, but the investigation was dropped after no signs of injury or forced entry to the property were found.

The inquest heard Mr Beckford rarely took his epilepsy medication and that he had been frequently treated at Kings College hospital after suffering seizures.

Dr Olaf Biedrzycki, who conducted the post mortem investigation on May 30 said: 'The toxicology report showed a trace of alcohol but it was not enough to be significant.

'Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy is not common, but it is by no means particularly unusual.

'It occurs more frequently in cases where people have poorly controlled seizures, or fit in their sleep.

'Very often the person is found face down in bed, as they were in this case.'

Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, deputy coroner Phillip Barlow said: 'It is clear Menelik Beckford had a long history of epilepsy.

'There were concerns over his compliance with the medication he was prescribed, and he was seen frequently at King's College Hospital suffering from seizures.

'My conclusion is that there are no suspicious circumstances involving the death, and the findings are consistent with a death from epilepsy.'
