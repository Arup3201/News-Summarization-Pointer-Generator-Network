Barack Obama's re-election bid has come under fire after a campaigner hinted he may include dinner cooked by White House chef Sam Kass as a way of raising money.

The idea was suggested as a possible fund-raising measure by Noah Shaw - a junior campaign manager -  who hoped to arrange a food tasting that would feature a number of local chefs.

The controversy comes after a video for an upcoming fund raiser was allegedly shot at the White House, leading commentators to criticise the President for his 'poor taste' in choosing the venue to serve as a campaign backdrop.

The video was shot for the upcoming 
'Dinner with Barack and Joe' contest - with the President encouraging 
people to donate $5 to his re-election campaign in a bid to win a seat 
with him and Vice President Joe Biden.

In March, Obama met with financial leaders and executives in the Blue Room of the White House - with most of those present being past campaign contributors to the President.

Speaking to ABC news about the video and earlier meeting, Mary Boyle, vice president of communications for Common Cause, said: 'It looks bad.

'It’s disappointing that a president who has gone further than most others in terms of putting up firewalls between the White House and special interests, would host in the White House a meeting with past or current donors.'

Responding to the criticism, Press Secretary Jay Carney said there was nothing wrong holding a Democratic National Convention event at the White House.

On the campaign trail: Mr Obama spoke about the economic recovery on his visit

He said: 'It is wholly understandable why the president would want to consult with business executives about their ideas about, you know, what to do in terms of economic policy and business policy going forward, including financial sector policy.

'The fact that they're supporters, obviously, he would want to talk to his supporters about that, as well.

Also speaking to ABC, Fred Wertheimer of
Democracy 21 said: 'It is simply common sense that nothing should be 
done that would leave the impression that the White House is being used 
for fund-raising.

'Meetings in the White House should not have any political fund-raising overtones and these kinds of activities ought to be avoided in the future.'

The controversy comes as the President spoke at Alcoa 
Davenport Works, an aluminum factory whose products are exported around 
the world in such high-tech applications as the wings for presidential 
jet Air Force One.

The plant has re-hired the workers it laid off during the recent recession and is eyeing an expansion, said Obama.

Obama says the uptick is a sign his economic policies are working.

But his visit to politically-strategic Iowa 
comes amid a run of weak economic indicators that have thrown the 
strength of U.S. economic recovery into question.

U.S. manufacturing, which had added 134,000 new jobs in the first 
four months of the year, lost 5,000 jobs in May.

Meanwhile, last month's unemployment 
rate rose to 9.1 per cent, while consumer confidence fell to 58.5 in 
June from a revised 61.7 in May.

The White House believes recovery in the
manufacturing industry is one way the U.S. can create jobs and stay 
competitive in the global marketplace.

Last week, Obama announced a $500
million joint effort by industry, universities and the federal 
government to help reposition the United States as a leader in 
cutting-edge manufacturing.

While the President's re-election hopes in Iowa, and across the country, are likely to rest on the economy, the chairman of the Iowa Republican 
Party said it comes as no surprise that Obama chose the Hawkeye state for his speech.

'There's a famous political saying 
that "no politician comes to Iowa by accident." I'm sure part of this is
a political calculation,' Matt Strawn said.

Obama's victory in the 2008 Iowa 
caucuses thrust him to the head of the Democratic pack, after which he eventually went on to 
beat Republican John McCain.

Democrats
have carried Iowa in five of the past six presidential elections and the state is expected to be competitive 
in the 
2012 general election. Republican hopefuls have flooded Iowa in 
recent weeks to court voters in its February caucus, the first 
in the nation.

Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, who has not said whether she will run for president, was also in Iowa on Tuesday for the screening of a documentary about her.
