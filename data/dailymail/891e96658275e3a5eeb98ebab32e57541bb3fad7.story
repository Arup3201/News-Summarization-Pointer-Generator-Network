The extremist preacher accused of radicalising three young Welsh jihadis was exposed last night as a benefits-claiming hypocrite.

Abu Waleed, 35, runs an online empire spouting anti-British bile and dreams of turning the country into an Islamist Nazi-style state.

In one chilling video he revels in a fantasy in which non-Muslims are forced to shave their heads and wear a red belt around their necks – a chilling echo of Germany under Hitler.

Abu Waleed, 35, runs an online empire spouting anti-British bile and dreams of turning the country into an Islamist Nazi-style state

Event: Abu Waleed, who lives in west London, dishes out burgers at a barbecue in Cardiff earlier this month

Waleed’s real name is Shahid Janjua and he lives in a council house in Hounslow, West London.

A source close to his family confirmed he is jobless and lives on benefits he claims for himself, his wife and his three disabled children.

The hate-mongering firebrand has even encouraged followers to cheat taxpayers out of income support and incapacity benefit.

Bearded Waleed is a leading member of Need4Khilafah which was banned last week for inciting terrorism.

He attended a barbecue in Cardiff earlier this month under the banner of the ISIS terror group, which is an Al Qaeda splinter group.

Former students Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana, both 20, were seen promoting a group closely linked to Waleed outside a mosque in the city seven months ago.

They appeared in a glossy ISIS recruitment video this month which has thrown the spotlight on the corrosive effect of shadowy hate preachers like Waleed.

In a newly-discovered series of films, Waleed outlines his vision of a Nazi-style, Islamic state in Britain.

He dreams of the flag of Islam flying over Big Ben, calls for the Queen to wear a burka and brands the Duchess of Cambridge ‘a whore’.

Waleed also calls for the ringing of church bells to be banned and says Christians should become second-class citizens who must submit to a chilling militant ideology.

The videos were recovered by the Middle East Media Research Institute, an American anti-extremism monitoring group. In the most recent film, made in January, Waleed said: ‘The kaffir [non-believer], when he walks down the street, he has to wear a red belt around his neck, and he has to have his forehead shaved, and he has to wear two shoes that are different from one another.’

In an earlier video, of a lecture delivered in April 2011, Waleed is even more inflammatory. He rants: ‘The nightmare on Downing Street, my dear brothers, is when the door of 10 Downing Street is kicked down by one muwahid [Muslim], and the  caliph [Islamic ruler] he walks in, and establishes the sharia.’

Waleed added that under a British sharia state, non-Muslims will pay a tax called jiziya for protection. He said that the Queen and the Duchess of Cambridge will have to wear veils.

Waleed’s home was searched by police in January and he remains under scrutiny.

He is in Anjem Choudary’s inner circle and attended Finsbury Park mosque when it was in the grip of Abu Hamza and his henchmen.

Waleed has also said that he was a student of the convicted hate preacher Abdullah El-Faisal. His mother, Nasreen, 57, has claimed he was ‘brainwashed’ by hate cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed.

In another video, Waleed mocked the Government for handing out benefits and encouraged his followers to cheat the system.

He said: ‘We have a lot of money today from the income support and the incapacity benefit. Obviously when you have the incapacity benefit, you want to make sure you walk with a limp when you leave the house just in case there’s someone taking pictures.’ Top QC Lord Carlile, the Government’s former counter terrorism watchdog, said Waleed’s comments border on an incitement to religious hatred.

The Lib Dem peer said: ‘The words he used are inflammatory, discriminatory, offensive and ludicrous.

‘The suggestion that a Christian should have his hair shaved and wear a red belt around  his neck reminds me of the  very worst views and actions of Adolf Hitler.’
