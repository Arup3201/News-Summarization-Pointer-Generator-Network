A drifter has been charged with murder after four young children died when he set fire to their southern Illinois house as they slept, authorities say.

Derrick Twardoski, 33, knew the children's parents and family members say he was exercising a vendetta of some kind because the tires of the cars in the driveway were slashed and an empty gas can was found outside the house.

Ethan Owen, 12, Kailey Owen, 9 and five-year-old twins Brandon and Landon Owen perished in their beds during the 2am blaze Friday morning at the house in Percy, Illinois.

Burned out: This is the house in Percy, Illinois, where four children died Friday morning. Their parents, an 18-year-old relative and a fifth child escaped

Their parents, Matthew and Natasha Owen, an 18-year-old relative escaped the house with only minor injuries. A fifth young sibling also escaped and was taken to the hospital and treated for smoke inhalation.

Twardoski, a drifter with no fixed address, knew the family, though police have not commented on a motive for the arson.

Drifter: Derrick Twardosky, 33, wore a suicide smock in court and sobbed in front of a judge

He appeared in court wearing a suicide smock today and sobbed uncontrollably in front of a judge.

He was ordered held in jail without bail. He is charged with four counts of murder.

All four children died of smoke inhalation, suffocating in their beds as they slept.

It is not known whether the house had working smoke detectors.

'I looked out my window and it was just in flame. Flames were coming out the roof and windows,' neighbor Shirley Hornbostel told the Southern Illinoisan.

Neighbors said they frequently saw the children playing outside their house on their bikes.

Their parents put up signs on the street to alert drivers of their children playing in the street.

The murders of such young children have shocked the tiny town of Percy, population less than 1,000.

'We're all shook up,' neighbor Paul Rubach, 85, told the newspaper.
