Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp insists he will show no mercy to under-fire Arsene Wenger on Wednesday, despite his side's early qualification for the Champions League knock-out stages.

The Germans have already booked their place in the last 16 and can cement their place at the top of Group D with a point on Wednesday.

And Klopp, whose side are a lowly 16th in the Bundesliga, wants to compound the misery on Arsenal; insisting his side will not go easy on the London club.

The German manager, who is a contender to replace Wenger at the Emirates Stadium once the Frenchman finally leaves, has problems of his own given his side's poor league form.

And he says the growing pressure on Wenger is of little concern to him as he tries to awaken his side from their domestic slumber.

He said: 'I don't know so much about the situation of Arsenal and British football. I don't know what the people think here.

'My plan is not for us to take our foot off the gas. In our situation we need each game to get more stability, we have to use the game tomorrow for the Bundesliga.

'We need stability, that is our big problem. If we can play very good against Arsenal, it will help us for the Bundesliga.

Meanwhile, Klopp insists he is not planning a move to England, despite growing speculation that he will be a Premier League manager in the not too distant future.

Klopp was quoted as saying that his next move would be to these shores, but he said: 'I don't think about my future at this moment.

'The only other language I speak is English and for my type of coaching, I need the language.

'But not now, I don't know when. I don't plan things like this. Sometimes timing is very important. But I have unfinished business with Dortmund in this moment.

'This is a really big challenge at the moment. I feel maximum of responsibility for (our league position).

'It is easy to feel responsible for winning games, it is much more difficult to handle this feeling now.'
