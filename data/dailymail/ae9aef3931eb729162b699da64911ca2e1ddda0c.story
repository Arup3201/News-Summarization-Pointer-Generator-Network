Tottenham are desperate to offload some of their deadwood in order to revamp their squad on transfer deadline day.

Mauricio Pochettino's squad is already two senior players over the Premier League's 25-man limit.

Spurs are looking at last-minute deals for Danny Welbeck and Montpellier's defensive midfielder Benjamin Stambouli, but will have to sell or loan other players.

Future Spurs: Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is keen to sign Manchester United's Danny Welbeck

Done deal: Benjamin Stambouli is set to join Tottenham from Montpellier after passing his medical

Three goalies: Lloris, Vorm and Friedel. 

11 defenders: Walker, Naughton, Kaboul, Dier, Vertonghen, Fryers, Fazio, Chiriches, Rose, Davies and Assou-Ekotto. 

11 midfielders: Lennon, Townsend, Lamela, Eriksen, Capoue, Sandro, Paulinho, Holtby, Chadli, Dembele and Mason.

Two strikers: Adebayor and Soldado.

That’s 27 senior players. Kane and Bentaleb don’t take a place in the Premier League squad as U21 players.

Lewis Holtby could be one of the first out of the door with Hamburg set to secure the playmaker on a season-long loan deal and a permanent £6m deal could follow.

The German side expect Holtby at the club for a medical later on Monday.

Aaron Lennon and Sandro could also be on the way with fellow Londoners QPR - and former Spurs boss Harry Redknapp - interested in the duo.

Redknapp is also set to sign young Tottenham left-back Zeki Fryers but he will have to fight off interest from Crystal Palace too. 

However Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is quoting a staggering £5m for out of favour left-back. Levy is playing hardball, even though the former Manchester United trainee has made just seven appearances for Tottenham.

Sidelines: Lewis Holtby has become a fringe player at Tottenham, regularly starting matches from the bench
