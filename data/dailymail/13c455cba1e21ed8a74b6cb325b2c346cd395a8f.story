Under fire: Author John Grisham sparked international outrage this week for saying men who watch child porn are sentenced too harshly while defending a Mississippi friend caught on serious charges

When John Grisham sparked outrage around the world by saying that men who view child pornography were being unfairly treated, the best-selling author had the case of a ‘law school buddy’ in mind.

He described a man who, under the influence of heavy drinking, had downloaded pictures from a website labeled ’16-year-old wannabe hookers or something’. Caught in a police sting, he was jailed for three years, said Grisham. ‘We’ve gone nuts with this incarceration’, intoned the master of courtroom thrillers.

Unfortunately for Grisham, however, the man on whom he reportedly based his controversial argument insists the author was completely wrong.

Michael Holleman, whose application to be reinstated as a lawyer was backed by Grisham after he was disbarred for downloading child pornography from the internet, told the Daily Mail he fully deserved the 18 months he received in prison.

‘I did something wrong and I don’t have a bit of resentment about the way I was treated,’ said Holleman, formerly one of Mississippi’s top criminal lawyers.

‘It’s illegal and should be punished. If it’s a crime, it’s a crime. There’s a violation of the right of privacy involved. There’s people now who, because of the internet, who are making child pornography so they can share it across the internet. There are good reasons for it to be illegal and punished.’

He added: ‘They were just images that I looked at and deleted. It consumed about five minutes of my life and it was a terrible mistake. I spend my days now helping other people.’

Grisham has not confirmed widespread reports that he was referring to 59-year-old Holleman but the similarities with his case are glaring.

Like the ‘buddy’ outlined by Grisham to illustrate his point, Holleman became a heavy drinker who downloaded child pornography only to be arrested and jailed following a ‘sting’ operation set up by Canadian police.

Holleman, from Gulfport, Mississippi, said Grisham had contacted him after his remarks provoked anger to assure him he had been referring to someone else.

Holleman, who is back practicing as a personal injury lawyer but no longer works for his prestigious family practice, admitted he had ‘paid a heavy price’ for breaking the law but had ‘moved on’.

He was released from prison in 1999 after serving 15 months of his sentence but the scandal ended his marriage.

Online reaction: Many commented that Grisham's claims don't take into account the victims of sexual abuse involved with child pornography

He said he was now ‘happily remarried’ with a son at university.

‘I decided to pick myself up, make the best of my life and be a better husband and better father, a better person and help other people,’ he said.

Grisham, the author of bestsellers such as The Firm, The Pelican Brief and The Client, was forced to apologise for his remarks in a newspaper interview.

Outrage: Fans quickly reacted to the controversial comments made by John Grisham, who is currently promoting his latest book, legal thriller Gray Mountain, which will be released next week

He insisted his comments ‘were in no way intended to show sympathy for those conviced of sex crimes, especially the sexual molestation of children.’

But compounding Grisham’s embarrassment, it emerges that he grossly understated the extent of his friend’s offences.

Far from merely looking at pictures of 16-year-olds – which wouldn’t anyway be illegal under Mississippi law - Holleman was accused of accessing sexually explicit images of children who in some cases were younger than 12.

Not only did he download them but he also sent some 13 images to an undercover police officer in Canada, resulting in a conviction for ‘sending and receiving’ child pornography.

Despite the seriousness of his crimes, Holleman agrees with Grisham on one point, he said. He doesn’t believe that anyone who looks at child pornography is automatically a paedophile and insisted he wasn’t one himself.

‘There’s no doctor in the world who would say because someone looks at something on the internet, that makes them a paedophile.

‘The pictures [he looked at] were disgusting – it’s like looking at the pictures of a horrible murder scene, which I’ve also done. But it doesn’t make you a murderer,’ he said.

‘But they were grotesque to me and I understand why it’s illegal and should be.’
