Ukip councillor and MEP candidate Donna Edmunds said companies must be allowed to refuse to serve people for whatever reason they want

Businesses should be allowed to turn women, gay or black people and refuse them service, a Ukip councillor has claimed.

Donna Edmunds, who is also standing for election to the European Parliament, claimed firms should not be ‘forced to serve or sell to anyone’, but today expressed ‘regret’ at her remarks.

It comes just days after Nigel Farage claimed his party’s candidates were of a 'quality and calibre' Ukip could be proud of.

Miss Edmunds, an MEP candidate for the South East and a Lewes district councillor, posted the comments on an internet forum.

She had been asked whether she supported remarks made by Henley-on-Thames Ukip councillor David Silvester who said the floods this winter had been caused by the Government's support for gay marriage.

The mother of one claimed she did not agree with her party colleague but said business owners should be allowed to refuse service to anyone they wanted to for any reason, the paper said.

She said: ‘I believe that all business owners, Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, should be allowed to withhold their services from whomever they choose whenever they choose.

‘It's their business. Why should they be forced to serve or sell to anyone?’

She later told reporters: ‘Business owners should be free to turn people away for whatever reason they choose - be they gay, black, or a woman.

‘I would not condone their actions, and would not shop in such a place. In fact, many people would probably choose not to shop there.

‘However, I am a libertarian and do not think the government should legislate against such things.’

Ukip leader Nigel Farage has boasted that his party's candidates are of a higher 'calibre' than in the past

James Ledward, editor of GScene Gay 
Magazine, described her views as ‘horrendous’. He said: ‘I’m 
flabbergasted. There is no place for views like this in 2014.’

The
 row comes despite attempts by Ukip to impose tougher tests on 
candidates to prevent them embarrassing the party with controversial 
views.

When the 32-year-old was asked to clarify her statement, she told the Brighton Argus newspaper: ‘I'm a libertarian so I don't think the state should have a role on who business owners serve.

Ukip councillor David Silvester claimed the winter storms were linked to gay marriage

‘I wouldn't refuse to serve gay 
people. I'm not saying their position is a correct one. I'm saying they 
should be free to make that choice themselves.

‘I regret what I wrote and can see how an essentially libertarian stance could be broadly misinterpreted.

‘I in no way endorse any form of discrimination. I believe in cutting red tape for business and I also strongly believe in an individual's personal and religious freedoms, but I stand against any form of prejudice.

‘I hope this remark has not caused any embarrassment for the party.’

A Ukip spokesman said: ‘It would appear that these comments were deeply misguided and we do not endorse the position intimated, but we believe she has apologised for the remarks.’

Last week Mr Farage used a speech to the Ukip spring conference to insist the party had improved the quality of its candidates.

He insisted his candidates could 'say what they like' because they represent a broad base of public opinion.

He said: 'These elections, in many ways, will be an opportunity for us to tell the political class where to go.'

The Ukip leader said that since the 2010 elections, candidates were now of a 'quality and calibre' the party could be proud of.

He said: 'Despite repeated attempts to ridicule us, our people come from the real world, they've got real-life experiences, unlike the political classes.’
