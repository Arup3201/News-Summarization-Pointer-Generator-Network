The Games has been the biggest national TV event since the mid-1990s.

Around 90 per cent of the population – 51.9million people – watched at least 15 minutes of coverage.

This compares to 81 per cent for the 2002 World Cup, 69 per cent for the Diamond Jubilee, and 61 per cent for the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Sunday’s closing ceremony was watched by a peak audience of 26.3million and an average of 23million across the BBC’s Olympics channels.

Danny Boyle’s opening ceremony was the most watched show of the Olympics with an audience of 27.3million at its peak.

More than 20million watched Jamaica’s Usain Bolt take gold in the 100m, while Mo Farah was the most popular athlete, with 17.1million watching him win the 10,000m. Jessica Ennis’s heptathlon win was seen by 16.3million.

The top Olympic events pulled in more than 12 million viewers - figures usually only achieved by the most sensational storylines in the soaps, or the later stages of reality shows such as The X Factor, Strictly Come Dancing and Britain’s Got Talent.

BBC1 controller Danny Cohen said: ‘It’s been a phenomenal Games and Team GB’s amazing achievements have helped draw huge audiences to BBC One and put the channel right at the heart of the action.

He added that the 'consistently large audiences' were unrivalled 'since the mid-1990s' and were the largest since the arrival of digital channels.

Incredible: A total of 17.1million watched Mo Farah win the 10,000m final

Big audience: More than 20million watched Jamaica's Usain Bolt take gold in the 100m

The increase in the number of 
stations has meant that the main channels have lost some of their 
audience share in the past two decades, as viewers have more options.

Director general Mark Thompson said the successful coverage had set a new bar for future broadcast of live events.

In
a message to staff published online, he said of the London 2012 Games 
coverage: ‘It has set a new benchmark for audiences about how we cover 
big events in the future.

'In
particular, this was the first truly digital Olympics and it gave them 
more choice and more control than they have ever experienced before.’

Interesting: More people watched London 2012 on TV than watched the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

Last night NBC said these Olympics had been the most watched event in US television history.

It said that viewing figures had ‘blown past’ Beijing’s 215million viewers, with 219.4million tuning in for the London Games.

An
average of 31.1million viewers watched the coverage each day during 
primetime, despite many complaining that NBC did not show key events, 
including the men’s 100m final, live.

The US’s huge medal haul of 46 
golds and 104 in total helped drive up ratings, much to the delight of 
main sponsors McDonald’s, Coca-Cola and P&G.

NBC, which paid 
$1.18 billion for the rights to the London Olympics, had initially 
projected lower ratings compared to the Beijing games.
