Campaigner: Trenton Oldfield pictured leaving Isleworth Crown Court after the start of his trial in which he is accused of causing a public nuisance

A campaigner 'protesting about elitism' brought the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race to a chaotic halt when he jumped into the Thames and swam into the rowers' path, a court heard today.

Trenton Oldfield, 36, stopped the annual contest for around half an hour on April 7, the first time in the history of the 158-year event that it had been disrupted by a swimmer.

BBC television footage of the annual event between the two elite universities, played to the jury, showed Oldfield being booed by spectators as he halted the crews racing neck and neck at the halfway mark.

Oldfield, of Whitechapel, east London, denies causing a public nuisance. He could face jail if convicted at Isleworth Crown Court.

Louis Mably, prosecuting, told jurors the race between Oxford and Cambridge was spoiled for spectators watching from the banks of the river or live on BBC TV, no to mention those taking part.

He said that despite it continuing, 'so far as the Boat Race was concerned, Mr Oldfield had obviously caused chaos'.

'The feeling of disappointment was obvious,' Mr Mably told jurors. 'Not only had everything been delayed but the crews and the public had been denied a natural conclusion to the race that they had come to the river to see.'

The prosecutor said that after being rescued from the river, Oldfield was detained by police who asked him why he had jumped in the river.

'He replied that he was protesting about elitism,' Mr Mably added. 'Exactly what he meant by that - who knows?'

Mr Mably said the two eight-man teams were just 'settling into the rhythm and the race was developing into what was a close and exciting contest' when the disruption occurred.

'The crews began to negotiate one of the bends of the course,' he told the jury. 'By this time both crews were rowing flat out neck and neck.

'What happened next was the race, which all the spectators on the towpath had come to see and was being watched by those tuning into the TV at home, was brought to an unexpected and sudden halt.

'There was one person who wanted to disrupt it and that person decided that he took precedence over everyone else.

'That person was the defendant who sits in the dock, Trenton Oldfield. What he did was jump into the river wearing a wetsuit and swim out into the path of the competing boats.'

The court heard that Oldfield, who was clad in a wetsuit, had swum into the paths of the two boats as they neared Chiswick Eyot between the two and three-mile markers of the race, which had set off from Putney.

Mr Mably said that although 'to some extent' there was a risk of danger to the rowers, the real threat was to Oldfield himself as he narrowly avoided being hit by the blade of an Oxford oar.

'One doesnâ€™t need to imagine too much the danger that could be caused to him if his head or neck had been struck by an oar being pulled through the water with full force.'

The prosecutor added that Oldfield was at risk of further danger from the motor boats which flank the rowing boats throughout the race.

'They were coming straight towards him, straight on course to plough into him,' he continued. 'The risk to his welfare and to his life was obvious. This was averted by the race umpire.'

The jury heard that having seen Oldfield in the path of the oncoming boats, umpire John Garrett stopped the race.

'What Mr Oldfield had done was in effect to force someone else to take responsibility to stop him from serious injury,' Mr Mably said.

'Of course, ordering the race to stop, bringing it to a halt in front of the tens and thousands of people who were watching at the river and on the television, it is not something that a race official is going to do lightly as obviously it spoils the race for everyone - the crews and the spectators.

'One person decided for his own reasons to disrupt a national sporting event and in the process the enjoyment of the spectating public.'

The court heard how Oldfield donned a wetsuit before diving into the Thames and swimming across the path of the race as it neared Chiswick Eyot between the two and three-mile markers

The Australian national brought the annual race to a 'chaotic' halt, the prosecutor said, just as it had begun to develop into a 'close and exciting contest'

Louis Mably, prosecuting, told jurors that while there was some risk to the race's participants, the real threat was to Oldfield himself, who narrowly missed being struck by an Oxford oar

Oldfield, an Australian, was plucked from the water by a boat and transferred to Chiswick Pier where he was met by police.

Both crews had to reposition their vessels at the new start line, close to where the incident had happened, while other boats had to move or cut their engines to keep the water flat.

The disruption also caused great mental and physical stress to the rowers, the court was told, as they had to prepare to start again, with Cambridge having an advantage.

Jurors watched the footage of the crews as they continued to battle towards the finish line at Mortlake, with Cambridge powering on to victory.

Isleworth Crown Court: Oldfield faces a potential jail sentence if he is found guilty of causing a public nuisance, which he denies

Summarising his opening speech, Mr Mably said it was for the jury to decide whether or not Oldfield had caused a public nuisance.

'It would be a pretty unsatisfactory state of affairs for the public as a whole if we have to live in a society where one person is able to stop these kind of events from happening,' the prosecutor said.

'If the enjoyment of the public is at the mercy of any crank, oddball or self-righteous protester who decides that their views were more important than anybody else's.'

The trial, which is expected to last up to four days, was adjourned to 10.15am tomorrow when prosecution witnesses will begin giving evidence.
