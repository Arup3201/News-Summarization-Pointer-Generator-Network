A grieving widow took her late husband’s ashes into a mobile phone shop – to persuade staff to stop his contract.

Maria Raybould, 56, was still receiving bills from T-Mobile after her husband David, 57, died of cancer – and was threatened with bailiffs if she didn’t pay up.

The day after Mr Raybould’s death, her son informed the phone company which asked to see a death certificate so staff could cancel the contract.

Maria Raybould's husband David died of cancer in August, but even after providing his birth certificate to T-Mobile, she received letters demanding money

But after complying with their wishes, Mrs Raybould continued to receive threatening letters telling her to pay £129 or face a cancellation charge. 

She said: ‘It’s gone downhill since then. I’ve had texts asking if David wanted to pay an extra £2.50 for broadband and letters saying that the bailiffs would be coming.’

Her husband died on August 29 after a long fight with cancer. He had been paying £26 a month by direct debit for a Samsung Galaxy SII Mini on a contract with T-Mobile.

Mrs Raybould, from Cardiff, said she visited her local T-Mobile branch three times in an attempt to convince them her husband had died.

On a third visit to a T-mobile shop, Mrs Raybould said she even showed her husband's ashes to staff - but still the letters asking for an overdue amount of £129.48

‘I’ve been up to the shop with the death certificate, with a letter from the crematorium, the funeral bills – even his ashes. I took in everything I could,’ she said. ‘I lost it in the shop. I gave them 20 minutes to sort it out. ‘I went outside and had a panic attack.

‘When I went back in the girl told me she had spoken to the manager and they were going to stop the contract. Then I had another letter about the bailiffs.

‘My son spoke with T-Mobile again and was assured it was sent in error and that it wasn’t going to happen again.’

But last week, Mrs Raybould received yet another letter addressed to her late husband from the firm’s customer finance department. It asked for a payment that was overdue and said the account would be passed to a debt collection agency.

She said it had been easier to bury her husband than end his phone contract.

‘How dare they put me and my sons through this? I wouldn’t want anyone to go through what we have over the last few months,’ she said.

‘It was easier for us to bury him than sort this out.’

A spokesman for T-Mobile yesterday apologised and said there was a delay to the automated process that cancels the balance, resulting in the letters being issued. He added: ‘We apologise to Mrs Raybould for any distress caused. We can confirm that the account has been closed and the balance cleared.’
