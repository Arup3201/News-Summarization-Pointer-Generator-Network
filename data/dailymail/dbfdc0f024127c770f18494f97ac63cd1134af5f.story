Alexis Sanchez's goal was not enough as Chile succumbed to a 2-1 defeat by Uruguay in Santiago on Tuesday night.

Uruguay, without Barcelona man Luis Suarez because of injury, were behind after 28 minutes when the Arsenal man's header from eight yards found its mark.

Sanchez, who had already forced Fernando Muslera into two saves early on, rose highest to meet Fabian Orellana's cross to head home.

It was Sanchez's eighth goal in six games for club and country.

Suarez was available to feature for Uruguay but national coach Oscar Tabarez chose instead to send him back to Spain.

The 27-year-old's nine-match ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup will prevent him from playing in next summer's Copa America and Tabarez wants his side to practise playing without their talisman. 

Rolan Diego, named as Suarez's replacement, equalised for Uruguay on the stroke of half-time at a packed Stadio Monumental from Carlos Andres Sanchez's clever set-piece.

And Uruguay got their winner 10 minutes from time, with Alvaro Gonzalez tucking the ball under Claudio Bravo after a mix-up in the Chile defence.
