Kim Jong-Un could be set to open a state-backed restaurant in Scotland serving North Korean delicacies such as dog meat soup and pine-nut gruel.

The dictator, who has also opened a diner in Amsterdam, is believed to be interested in opening another in the UK.

Experts say that Kim is especially keen on opening the restaurant in Scotland due to his love of whisky and its popularity among the communist ruling elite.

The 'Pyongyang' chain of restaurants already has branches in China and Asia, with proceeds from the business being funnelled back into North Korea to help prop up the secretive regime.

Michael Madden, editor of North Korea Leadership Watch, said the country is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries, especially those with left-wing leanings.

He explained: 'It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.

'The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean's elite's thoughts.

'Despite voting no they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable than England, plus North Koreans love whisky.

'Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.'

The Pyongyang restaurants are run in partnership with Office 39, a secretive branch of the North Korean government, which uses them as a legal way of raising overseas cash.

Mr Madden, a frequent visitor to North Korea, added: 'They are one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.

'They are done like a franchise with the state renting the brand out to other Koreans to run.'

Fellow expert Jenny Town, of the US-Korea Institute, said she too believed Pyongyang had warmed to Scotland in recent months.

She added: 'North Korea is going to support any country struggling for independence and legitimacy, as North Korea itself still continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy as a sovereign nation.'

The state-run food outlets - which began springing up about 10 years ago - channel up to 30 per cent of takings back to Pyongyang.

But some critics fear the cash ends up in Jong-Un’s own pockets to fund his lifestyle.

As well as a love for whisky, the North Korean leader is reportedly hooked on Swiss cheese.

It’s claimed he imports vast quantities at huge expense - despite millions of his countrymen being malnourished.

A unhealthy appetite for Emmental is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning so much that he now walks with a limp.

The North Korean Embassy in London did not respond to requests for a comment.
