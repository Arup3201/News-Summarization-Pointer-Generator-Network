Dunkin' Donuts is rolling out a revamped design for its coffee houses and if it all looks rather familiar then that’s because it is following the hottest trend in fast food restaurants right now, known as ‘fast casual’.

The donut shop's new look retains the bright orange and pink colors of the brand’s logo, but introduces lots of comfortable chairs, plugs for electrical devices and moody lighting.

This more sophisticated look has already been introduced by other chains including McDonald’s, Burger King and even Dunkin’s arch rival Starbucks.

The company is banking on the makeover helping it break out of the ‘breakfast-only’ category and start getting customers to think of it as an all-day destination.

‘The modernized design incorporates many new features to create a warm environment for guests who seek a longer, more relaxed visit to Dunkin’ Donuts as part of their day,’ the company said in a release. 

‘Fast casual’ is all about fast food restaurants creating more desirable spaces for people who want to do more than simply grab a coffee to go.

The donut chain is hoping to capitalize on two workplace trends says Kathy Hayden, foodservice analyst at Mintel.

Dunkin' Donuts traditional had quite basic interiors that weren't very welcoming for people who wanted to eat in

As more people telecommute, they’re looking for places where they can get out of their home or apartment and still get work done. Also a more mobile work force means more demand for places that can serve as locations for on-the-go business meetings.

‘Offering wi-fi is not enough. You need to have a welcoming atmosphere,’ Hayden told NBC.

While most Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants already offer free Wi-Fi, the new designs will also feature flat-panel televisions and satellite music.

The new design, is the brand’s first in nearly seven years. 

Despite their long-running rivalry, Dunkin' Donuts new design appears to owe a lot to that of Starbucks

The new look includes four restaurant design options for franchisees, each featuring variations in layout, color schemes, graphics, textures, furniture and/or lighting. The designs are called: Original Blend, Cappuccino Blend, Dark Roast and Jazz Brew.

Franchise owners will be able to select individual elements from any of the four options, to create a restaurant design that best serves their specific restaurant size and location.

The rollout of the new and remodeled Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants started in April, but it will be many years before the majority of Dunkin’ Donuts locations feature the new look and layout.
