President Barack Obama cast his vote early for the 2014 midterm elections in a bid to get voters to go to the polls  ahead of election day.

The president voted in a community center in Chicago - named after the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., - near his family's home on Chicago's South Side.

'The most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen,' the president told reporters at the Center, as he took advantage of the first day of early voting in Illinois.

Symbolic: President Obama's gesture was widely seen as being symbolic as he explained that the most 'important job in a democracy is the job of citizen' to vote

'I’m so glad I can early vote. It’s so exciting. I love voting,' the president said, in a not-so-subtle way. 

Adding: 'Everybody in Illinois [should] vote early. It’s a wonderful opportunity.' 

Before he was handed his ballot, a poll worker asked if he was Barack Obama, according to Politico.

'That’s me,' he said. 

However, his gesture was widely seen as being symbolic as he explained that the most 'important job in a democracy is the job of citizen.'

Obama also delivered doughnuts and pastries to Democratic campaign volunteers in Chicago to boost moral on Monday.

He carried  the boxes of pastries into a Pat Quinn campaign office as Governor Pat Quinn and Senator Dick Durbin stood alongside him.

'The way we win any election is making sure we turn out,' he told the room full of volunteers.

And on Sunday night, the president did not shy away from saying exactly who he was likely to cast his vote for at a rally for Illinois Governor Pat Quinn. The governor is running for re-election in Obama's home state.

A fired up Obama told a crowd at Chicago State University, that he would vote early for Quinn and Sen. Dick Durbin.

'The first thing I'm gonna do tomorrow is cast my vote to re-elect Dick Durbin and give my friend Pat Quinn four more years as governor of the great state of Illinois,' Obama said.

Obama described Durbin as a mentor who took him under his wing when he first became a senator in 2005.

He said: 'Durbin helped make sure that I didn't get into too much trouble.' 

However, another stop made by the president on the campaign trail Sunday was marred by a steady stream of crowd members leaving early and even a yelling heckler.

The president was at the Democratic rally in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, near Washington, to support Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown, who is running for governor.

But as Obama's approval levels drop to record lows, many candidates from his party have been reluctant to appear with the president during their election races because of his waning popularity.

Obama and other Democrats have been urging their supporters to vote early this year instead of waiting until Election Day.

His party is hoping to turn out Democratic-leaning voters, including minorities and young people, who frequently skip voting in midterm years.

In 2012, Democrats proved that they could use early voting as a tactic against the Republicans to give them a head start.

The strong turnout for early voting is widely seen as one of the things which helped Obama beat Mitt Romney in battleground states like Iowa.

At least 33 states will offer early voting this year, which has led both parties to encourage voters to take to the polls early.

Republicans have even decided to invest in early voting in states where there are tight Senate contests this year.
