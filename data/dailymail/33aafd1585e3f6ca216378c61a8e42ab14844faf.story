A mother-of-two who matched five numbers and the bonus ball on EuroMillions lottery thought she had win £3,000, only to find it was in fact £3million. 

Christmas arrived early for Jenn Burston, 27, and her husband Ian from Exeter, Devon, after she played a chance Lucky Dip game online. 

Although Mrs Burston did not match all six numbers, a quadruple rollover jackpot meant she still won a share of £15million in Wednesday's draw.

Mrs Burston, who only recently returned to work in administration from maternity leave was said she was 'gobsmacked' by the size of the win. 

'I always play EuroMillions online and saw the big Lotto rollover so decided to have a go,' she said.

'On Wednesday night, I was on my way to bed and thought I’d look at my account to see if I’d won anything.

'I logged in on my phone and it said I was a winner - my numbers were circled.

'I thought hang on a minute, I think I’ve won £3,000 and took my phone to go and show my husband.

'All my husband Ian kept saying was, "are you sure it’s your ticket?" so I tried to show him on the phone, but we were so excited and couldn’t really see the amount because it was so small, so we decided to get the iPad and log on with a bigger screen.

'Once we realised it was £3million neither of us knew what to do next - so I called my mum and my husband called his dad, and by this time, it must have been after 11pm.' 

Lotto can only roll over four times and as no one matched all six numbers in the draw on December 17, the prize money was shared between the five winners in the next winning prize level, with each winner getting more than £3million.

After spending the next few hours looking at her phone rather than sleeping, Mrs Burston received an email from The National Lottery confirming she had won the prize, although she carried on checking until the morning.

Mrs Burston, who has two young children, says she plans to use her winnings to buy a larger home because her family was starting to outgrow their three bed semi detached.

She also plans to spend some of the cash on her family, and although she and service engineer Mr Burston, 30, had already booked a holiday to Turkey next summer, she said they may try to 'squeeze in another one.'

Mrs Burston, who has been married for two and a half years, went back to work part time a month ago after the birth of her second child, and has already been back in since her big lottery win, saying: 'You can’t let people down, can you?'

She added: 'I keep asking myself, just how do you spend that sort of money?

'I’m sure with £3million in the bnk the knack will come for us.'
