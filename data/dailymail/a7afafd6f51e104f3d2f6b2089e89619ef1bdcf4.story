This is the heart-warming moment a young orangutan called Terusan bounds joyfully into the Indonesian wild for the first time, his arms waving excitedly above his head.

Even the cameraman struggles to keep up with the thrilled ape as he heads out to explore his new surroundings, to the obvious delight of his carers from the Borneo Orangutan Survival (BOS) Foundation. 

Terusan was one of 21 orangutans released into the wild at the Bukit Batikap Conservation Forest earlier this month and their reactions - joyful, uncertain, apprehensive - were all caught on camera.

And he's off! The cameraman can barely keep up as a young orangutan called Terusan bounds off into the Indonesian wild for the first time, running from the cage as soon as it is opened

No stopping me now! Terusan can't contain his excitement as he sprints off to explore his new environment at the Bukit Batikap conservation forest, to the obvious delight of his carers

The five mothers and their babies had been looked after at the Nyaru Menteng orangutan rescue and rehabilitation centre for several years and many had never experienced the wild.

They were taken into rehabilitation as young orangutans who, although born wild, found themselves in captivity.

It can take up to 12 years to prepare them for life in the wild, but pictures like these make all the work worthwhile.

Another one shows Leonora and her baby
Lamar who, unlike the other orangutans, didn't have to be sedated for 
the long plane and helicopter journey to the release area.

Instead, the mother picked up her baby and walked calmly into the travel container without any fuss.

Once
released, all the orangutans wasted little time in getting to know 
every tree and branch of their new home - with some even making nests.

Visit the Orangutan Protection Foundation's website at www.opf.org for more information. 

This is all new to me! Jamiat takes a good look at his new home before slipping out of the crate. He was one of 21 orangutans released into the wild by the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation

New home: Leonora and her baby Lamar needed no encouragement to jump in the crate to the release area and were the only orangutans who didn't need sedation for the plane and helicopter journey

Not hanging around: Sif and Sifa get to grips with their new habitat and seem to have wasted no time in finding a branch to swing from

Not sure about this! Little Sifa looks a bit nervous as he embarks on the move from the Nyaru Menteng rescue centre to the conservation forest

Hold on tight: Baby Embong clings on to his mother Emen with more than a glint of anxiety in his eyes as they prepare to make their big move into the wild (left), but once there they didn't hesitate in finding a nice tall tree to climb (right). But while Emen is looking for a higher vantage point, little Embong just can't look down...

They will now be monitored closely for up to a year to make sure they can fend for themselves.

Meanwhile, the BOS Foundation is just starting its valuable work.

Over
the next three years, they have more than 600 orangutans to release 
from Nyaru Menteng in order to meet a government target to return all 
rehabilitated orangutans to the wild.

Bungaran Saragih, chairman of the BOS Foundation Board of Trustees, said: 'I have a mixed feeling of joy and sadness.

'I
feel sad for us to be separated from the orangutans we have cared for, 
but I am also excited that 13 orangutans from the 21 to be released have
all successfully progressed through our reintroduction programme in 
Nyaru Menteng.'

What a view! All the orangutans were transported to the conservation forest by helicopter (left). Once there, Chanel surveys the panorama of the forest canopy but her baby Charlie only has eyes for the camera in front (right)

Monkeying around: Embong climbs on his mother Emen's back for a better look around... but she doesn't look too pleased to be carrying the extra weight

King of swing: Leonora and Lamar take a whistlestop tour between the branches as they get to know their new territory

All in a tangle: Giant the orangutan seems right at home as she frolics amongst the vines and branches deep in the forest cover

A quick peep: Deep in the jungle, Emen and Ebong's crate is opened up and they get their first taste of freedom in the wild

The big move: Garu is wide-eyed in anticipation as he climbs into a crate for the journey into the wild

Time to go: Workers at the rescue centre ensure the sling load around one of the crates is nice and tight as they prepare to transport the 21 orangutans by helicopter

On our way: One of the apes is loaded onto the back of a pick-up truck en route to the helipad

No fuss: Leonora came out of her enclosure at the centre without any difficulties

Not letting go: Baby Embong clings to the belly of his mother as they're carried to transport waiting to take them to the helipad

Helping hand: Leonora didn't need any sedation to be lifted into the crates, instead walking calmly there with her baby

Out of it: Charlie though needed a little medical help to get through the journey and was sedated before lift-off
