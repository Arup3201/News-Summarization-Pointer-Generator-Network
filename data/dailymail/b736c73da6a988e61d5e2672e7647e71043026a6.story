West Ham manager Sam Allardyce believes Andy Carroll is getting the best possible treatment on and off the pitch as girlfriend Billi Mucklow helps him on the road to recovery from his ankle injury.

The 25-year-old was understandably frustrated after receiving his latest injury setback last month, but Allardyce believes Mucklow is having a positive influence on Carroll as they spend time together in the gym, with him looking for a return to action by November time. 

Allardyce said: 'Andy with his girlfriend, as far as I can see, is doing lots of good things. I've seen pictures of Andy in the gym she has, which is obviously an exceptionally nice place to be.

'If he's doing some workouts with his girlfriend as well as his rehab with us, it can only benefit and it passes the time.'

Allardyce had sympathy for his striker after his latest setback, admitting such time on the sidelines is a lonely time for any footballer.

He added: 'For a player the big problem is sitting with a boot on and getting past the time and the boredom. There has to be some release from that - but make sure it's the right release, not the wrong one.

'I don't think people realise just how depressing it can be for a player. And of course you may well see Andy on social media now, you'll see him with his high-profile girlfriend, seeming like he's enjoying himself which he probably is at the time but deep down inside it's a long, lonely way back for him.

Frustrating: Carroll has endured a injury-plagued spell so far at West Ham

'There are many lonely moments you have to get through and overcome.But any player has to use that as a positive and when they get fit again really continue to dedicate themselves to staying as fit as possible and play football and enjoy it.

'When you've had the injuries Andy's had you start to appreciate football more than you ever have.'

Despite the setback to Carroll, Allardyce remains confident of a top-10 finish for the Hammers this season.

West Ham begin the new Premier League season with a mouthwatering clash at home to London rivals Tottenham on Saturday.
