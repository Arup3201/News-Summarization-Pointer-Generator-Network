The remains of a woman who has been missing for more than thirty years have been discovered on the side of a Utah hill.

Theresa Greaves, 23 at the time, went missing from her home in Woods Cross, Utah on August 5, 1983, after going for a job interview in nearby Salt Lake City.

In February of this year, a man discovered a human skull on the side of a highway access road in Fruit Heights, about ten miles north of her home in the opposite direction from the state capital.

Police found clothing and bones on a hillside in Fruit Heights, Utah, after a passerby found the skull of Theresa Greaves

Ms Greaves, who was 23 at the time of her disappearance in 1983, had gone for a job interview in Salt Lake City but never returned to her home north of the state capital

Police later found clothing and other bones at the site, which have now been identified as Ms Greaves.

Her case has remained unresolved for 31 and a half years, and police think that her body may have been washed down the hill after originally being placed higher.

Doug Lovell, who is currently starting a new trial for the 1985 murder of a 39-year-old woman he once pleaded guilty to killing, was previously questioned in the case, according to the Deseret News.

The inmate, who was previously on death row, has denied knowing Ms Greaves or having any involvement with her or another woman who went missing in the 1980s.

Ms Greaves called a friend after she arrived by bus in Salt Lake City for her interview, but never returned to her mobile home north of the city, where she lived with a roommate.

Ms Greaves (pictured) made contact with a friend to confirm she had arrived in Salt Lake before her disapperance.  Her parents have died and police are unable to contact any living relatives.

Police believe that Ms Greaves's body may have originally been placed higher up the hillside it was found on before it washed down towards the road

Police are treating Ms Greaves's case as a homicide, but are not released details of a medical examiner's report.

Authorities have been unable to contact any relatives and the parents of the New Jersey native have died.

She moved to Utah when she was 18. 

Woods Cross Police Department has spoken with the officer who originally conducted the investigation. 

The victim would have turned 56 this October.
