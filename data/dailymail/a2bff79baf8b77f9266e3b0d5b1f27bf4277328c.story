The girlfriend of Russian tycoon Roman
 Abramovich has dramatically apologised after being accused of racism by
 posing in a chair that resembled a bound and semi-naked black woman.

Art
 expert and fashion guru Dasha Zhukova, 32, said: 'I utterly abhor 
racism, and would like to apologise to anyone who has been offended by 
this image.'

The photograph showing her sitting in the shocking chair was published 'completely out of context', she said.

Outrage: Buro 247 used the horrendously offensive image, pictured, of Dasha Zhukova Monday to illustrate an unrelated interview about the former model's new magazine, Garage

The
 chair - designed by Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard - was 'an art work
 intended specifically as a commentary on gender and racial politics', 
she said.

The image appeared
 in blog Buro 24/7 run by a leading Russian fashionista, Miroslava Duma,
 accompanying an interview with Abramovich's partner, who is the founder
 of a leading Moscow art gallery.Â 

It
 shows 32-year-old Zhukova wearing a white shirt and jeans sitting on a 
chair, the seat of which is mounted on a lifelike model of a topless 
black woman lying on her back in bondage gear with her legs up in the 
air and belted to her body.

The image created a storm in Britain and other Western countries.

'Certain things just shouldn't exist,' said Cosmopolitan.com's pop culture editor Alex Rees.

'But
 if they must... they really shouldn't be photographed and uploaded onto
 the Internet -- and especially not on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.'

The blog also apologised.

'Buro 24/7 is against racism and everything that may humiliate people,' said an editorial statement.

'We sincerely apologise if the posted photos insulted our readers.'

Russian
 art expert Andrei Yerofeyev said the chair was inspired by British pop 
artist Allen Jones, who created similar sculptures featuring white 
women.

Zhukova is the founder of Garage Center for Contemporary Culture, a gallery in Moscow's Gorky Park.

Cropped version: After an immediate barrage of disgusted comments, Duma deleted the picture from Instagram and cropped out the chair on Buro 24/7, pictured

'This is incredibly racist,' Organizing for Women's Liberation tweeted Monday, after news of the unbelievable picture spread.

Ms Zhukova's publicist blasted the use of the image on MLK day and said her client has a strong record of promoting diversity.

She said it was 'regrettable' that the image of the chair by Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard had been used on such a sensitive day by the blog, and pointed out that such a use took the work completely out of context.

Ms Zhukova herself added: 'This photograph, which has been published completely out of context, is of an art work intended specifically as a commentary on gender and racial politics. I utterly abhor racism, and would like to apologise to anyone who has been offended by this image.'

Zhukova, staring at the camera, appears the complete opposite of the black woman she's weighing down.

Editor: Dasha Zhukova is the editor-in-chief of Garage magazine, pictured, which focused on art and fashion. She is also described as a Russian socialite

Dasha Zhukova, the partner of 
Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich and editor-in-chief of 
bi-annual art and fashion magazine Garage, was born in Moscow but grew up in California.

The 32-year-old's father is a prominent Russian businessman and oil magnate and her mother was a Russian 
scientist. Her parents split when she was 3 and she and her mother moved to the US 
when she was 10.

She went to a privileged Jewish day school in California and graduated the University of California, Santa Barbara
 before returning to Moscow and later moving to London.

In
 2008, Zhukova founded the IRIS Foundation, a non-profit organization 
dedicated to promoting contemporary culture.

A year later, she was 
appointed editor-in-chief of the fashion magazine Pop but she only 
lasted three issues.

She and Abramovich, who is worth $14 billion, have 
two children Aaron Alexander, born 3 December 2009 and Leah Lou, born 15
 April 2013. Abramovich has five other children from a previous 
relationship.

Zhukova's was previously with Marat Safin, the retired 
former Tennis World Champion Number 1 but the couple split in 2005.

FashionBombDaily.com
 editor Claire Sulmers was among the first to express her disbelief, 
claiming the photo's message was startlingly clear: 'White dominance and
 superiority, articulated in a seemingly serene yet overtly degrading 
way.'

She wrote on her blog that racism remained rampant in the art and fashion worlds and this needed to stop.

'The
 art and fashion industries are the few bastions of society where 
blatant racism and ignorance are given the greenlight in the name of 
creativity,' Sulmers complained.

Twitter erupted after Duma published the article, presumably not realizing citizens in the U.S. and around the world were remembering the Civil Rights movement and Martin Luther King's struggles for racial equality.

User Ric Caric wrote, 'I guess Garage Magazine thought that today would be a great day to advertise their racism,' while Julee A. Wilson tweeted, 'MLK is turning in his grave and I'm cursing these people's stupidity with all my heart and soul! MAJOR fail!'

User Nikia tweeted: 'Extremely disappointed in Miroslava Duma and Buro247 for posting this nonsense, especially on a day like today. smh,' and Alex von Tunzelmann wrote, 'Even in the grim, tasteless world of fashion photography, this revolting racist image- pub'd on MLK Day!- stands out.'

Zhukova was born in Moscow to a prominent Russian businessman and oil magnate and a Russian scientist but her parents split when she was three and at 10 she moved to the US with her mother.

She went to a privileged day school in California and then attended the University of California, Santa Barbara before returning to Moscow and later moving to London.

She and Abramovich, who is worth $14 billion and known for his luxury yachts, have two children Aaron Alexander, born 3 December 2009 and Leah Lou, born 15 April 2013.

Neither Buro 24/7 nor Dasha Zhukova have yet responded to MailOnline's calls for comment.

Offensive timing: The horror picture was published on a day U.S. citizens and many people from other countries were remembering the Civil Rights movement and Martin Luther King's struggles for racial equality
