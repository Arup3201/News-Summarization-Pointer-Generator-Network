An Ohio pastor was brutally attacked Sunday by a man who describes himself as a militant atheist after asking the man’s girlfriend if he was doing that very thing to her.

Reverend Norman Hayes, 57, had just given a sermon at North Hampton’s Bridge Community Church, when he asked the girlfriend of an attendee who was being argumentative and confrontational during the service if she ‘felt safe.’

That man, 28-year-old James Maxie was so infuriated by the question that he accosted the reverend and brutally beat him in the face and head, so much so that the clergyman feared for his life.

Shaken: Reverend Norman Hayes was left with his nose broken in two places and in need of stitches after asking Maxie's girlfriend if she feared for her safety around Maxie

‘I questioned his girlfriend in his presence if she felt safe,’ Hayes told WHIO. ‘He was very, very upset that I'd even suggest that he would hurt her.’

That’s when Maxie pounced, leaving Hayes with a broken nose and in need of several stitches on his face.

‘He came from nowhere and hit me…and knocked me down,’ Hayes said. ‘It was fortunate he did stop. I really believe my life was in danger.’

According to WHIO, Maxie’s girlfriend is a congregant at the church and Maxie attended with her that day.

Maxie, who has a history of sex offenses, felony assault, and aniomal cruelty, was enraged at the assertion that he beats his girlfriend

'People need to pay for what they have done': The Ohio pastor says he forgives Maxie but that he must still be punished

‘It looked like he was looking for an argument,’ said Hayes, who claims Maxie heckled him during the sermon and spoke of Hitler before it.

But Maxie told police he was simply asked the pastor ‘questions about science and faith,’ he was struggling with and that he was at the sermon because he was ‘trying to regain my faith in God.’

While the pastor says he asked the girlfriend if Maxie was abusive, Maxie told police Hayes stated she was ‘going to hell for dating’ him.

After the assault, Maxie and his girlfriend left the church and Maxie ran into a corn field and was later apprehended by Clark County, Ohio police while hiding behind an area home.

And it wasn’t Maxie’s first run-in with the law. He’s also a convicted sex offender for unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, and convicted felon on previous assault charges, and he has a history of cruelty to animals.

He can now add another felony assault charge, along with misdemeanor resisting arrest, to that list.

A still bruised and swollen Hayes told WHIO that he’s forgiven Maxie, but that doesn’t mean he shouldn’t be punished.

‘We believe there is hope for everyone,’ Hayes said, ‘but we also believe that regardless of that, people need to pay for what they have done, and I hope he has to pay for what he has done. Get put away for a while and not hurt anyone else. In my opinion, the next person won't be as lucky as I was.’

Hayes has won an order of protection against Maxie, who is being held in lieu of $51,000 bond.

Troubled: Maxie's Facebook page is peppered with references to atheism, to the evils of the church, and the hypocrisy of organized religion, but he told police that he was at the church to get back in touch with God
