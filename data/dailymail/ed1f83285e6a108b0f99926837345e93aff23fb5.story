'They hate the way you walk,’ begins the latest stupid adidas advert, ‘they hate the way you talk...’ It’s Luis Suarez time again, folks. Oh, sure, the rest of the adidas roster is there, Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez, Karim Benzema — but by focusing on the hatred top footballers receive, the spiel is plainly inspired by one man.

Shamelessly, adidas’s posters at the World Cup showed Suarez, teeth bared, like a ferocious beast, and tried to make a selling point of his previous poor behaviour. 

They were hastily taken down when he bit an opponent for the third time in his career, and fans took to posing with the pictures as if putting their heads in a lion’s mouth. Suarez and adidas were mocked mercilessly, but deservedly.

Luis Suarez (centre) is no stranger to controversy and has invited fans to ‘bring on the hate’ in a new advert

Suarez was caught up in another moment of infamy when he bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini last summer

 Gareth Bale stars in the advert as the Real Madrid star poses with the words: 'There will be haters'

‘There will be haters,’ is the latest campaign message. And indeed there will. But not when Suarez (below) just plays his football. Last season, on the back of a brilliant and unsullied Premier League season, Suarez’s fellow professionals made him their player of the year and the football writers did the same. He was universally praised for the performance that knocked England out of the World Cup, too.

Then he bit Giorgio Chiellini, got banned, and Uruguay were soundly beaten and eliminated in their next game by Colombia.

So, in fact, people don’t hate the way Suarez walks and they don’t hate the way he talks. They hate that he keeps biting people. And that adidas tries to sell its football boots off the back of this. They really hate that.

adidas are launching their latest set of f50, predator, nitrocharge and 11pro boots with the advert
