You may be waiting for the clock to tick round to 5pm today so you can leave the office. But in your head, the working week is already over by then.

Workers switch off for the weekend at 2.39pm on Friday, it is claimed. A study of 2,000 office staff found the majority mentally wind things down well before the official end of the day.

Almost half admit they take Fridays easier than any other day.

Kicking back: A majority of British workers ease up on a Friday afternoon

Six in ten feel entitled to ease up earlier on a Friday because they work more than their contracted hours throughout the week.

The average worker puts at least three important things on hold until Monday, it was found.

Yet more than 80 per cent said their boss still gets ‘value for money’ by employing them.

Many relaxed workers admitted to 
deliberately scaling down workloads to wind things up early on a Friday,
 pinpointing 1.32pm as the time they really start shifting into lower 
gear.

By 2.39pm workers have mentally started their weekends in earnest.

The survey also confirmed that the 'Friday feeling' exists - a third said their workplace has a noticeably better atmosphere on a Friday and 47 per cent said their boss is a lot more lenient on this day.

The research, commissioned by British Airways, found the Friday afternoon wind-down often consists of using Facebook, arranging weekend plans and online banking.

Professor Frank Bond, a leading expert in Occupational Psychology, said: 'With most people working more than their contracted hours, it is perhaps no surprise that people tend to take their foot off the pedal on Friday afternoons.

It can wait: Workers confessed to ignoring emails and calls when the end of the week drew near

'It’s certainly not ideal to have important meetings at the end of the week, as we wind down for the weekend. In most cases, that meeting can wait until Monday morning.

'A great deal of research shows that giving such control over work scheduling makes employees more productive, motivated and healthy.'

A quarter regularly ignores emails on a Friday and 28 per cent often fall victim to a severe case of selective hearing when the phone rings - or push it straight to voicemail.

While the average worker puts at least three important things on hold until Monday because they just can’t bear to deal with them at the end of the week.

Instead, conducting online shopping, emailing friends and family and even booking holidays also featured in the top 10 activities workers were likely to sneak in at the end of the week.

Although the average official finishing time was still 5pm, three in ten do sometimes get let out early and a fifth enjoy casual dress on a Friday.

Robin Glover-Faure, Head of Shorthaul for British Airways, said: 'With this research revealing that Brits are switching off for the weekend slightly earlier than the traditional 5pm, it’s clear to see that planning ahead and having exciting activities lined up is more important than ever.'
