Sir Jeremy Heywood was given a humiliating rebuke by MPs yesterday for clearing taxpayer-funded advisers to take part in political campaigning.

Westminster’s Public Administration Committee said the country’s top mandarin had been ‘wrong in law’ during a row over two of Theresa May’s Special Advisers.

It is another blow to the reputation of the Cabinet Secretary – who is known as Sir Cover Up for trying to block the publication of letters related to the Iraq War.

Nick Timothy and Stephen Parkinson, two of the Home Secretary’s closest aides, refused an order from Tory HQ to take part in telephone canvassing during last year’s Rochester by-election.

The pair said it was a breach of the special adviser's code, which says that - as public servants - they should not conduct canvassing in by-election campaigns and are required to resign their posts if they wish to do so.

Number Ten and Tory HQ disagreed – suspending both men from the list of candidates at the forthcoming General Election as a punishment.

To justify the decision, Number Ten relied upon advice from Sir Jeremy, who wields enormous power inside Government.

He controversially ruled it was acceptable for special advisers to take part in ‘backroom support’ activities in their private time and telephone canvassing fell into this category.

But that interpretation has now been flatly rejected by the public administration committee.

The committee said: ‘Any direction to a Special Adviser to conduct telephone canvassing was misguided, and that advice that such a direction or such canvassing was permitted under their Code and contract of employment was wrong in law.

‘We recommend that Special Advisers should never again be confronted with directions or informal pressure that puts them in breach of the Code and of their contracts of employment.’

The Speaker’s Counsel, Michael Carpenter, told MPs he had been ‘unpersuaded’ by Sir Jeremy’s arguments.

Mr Carpenter said that, far from being a backroom activity, telephone canvassing involved taking part in a political debate with members of the public.

Mr Timothy and Mr Parkinson are now expected to apply to be re-instated to the candidates list after the election. Sources said they appeared to have a ‘slam dunk case’ to get their suspension lifted.

Labour deputy chairman Jon Ashworth said: ‘The Parliamentary Authorities have delivered a damning assessment of the Number 10 operation, and we now need to know which Ministers were complicit in issuing this ‘misguided’ advice.

‘Given the proximity of the election campaign, we need a formal government response today which outlines how Number 10 will ensure no rules will be broken over the role played by Special Advisers.’

At the time, the decision to remove the advisers from the candidates list was widely seen as the latest episode in a long-running feud between Downing Street and the Home Office.

Tensions have repeatedly flared amid fevered speculation over Mrs May’s own leadership ambitions. Polls have shown she is the activists’ favourite to succeed the Prime Minister.

Another of the Home Secretary’s advisers, Fiona Cunningham, was forced to quit last summer after clashing with Michael Gove over extremism in schools.

Last week, Sir Jeremy came under fire over new rules which ban the country’s 430,000 civil servants from talking to journalists without ministerial approval.

He approved the order at the request of Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude.

Yesterday, the Mail told how the move was opposed by London Mayor Boris Johnson, who said: ‘Sunlight is the best disinfectant.’
