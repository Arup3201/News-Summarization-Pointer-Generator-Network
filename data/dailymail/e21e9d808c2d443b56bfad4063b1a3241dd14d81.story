Domestic Goddess Nigella Lawson has refused to co-operate with Vanity Fair as they ready to publish a probe into her marriage split from Charles Saatchi.

The 53-year-old celebrity chef is at the center of a new report to be published by the magazine in January that will detail the alleged truth behind the breakdown of her marriage - after her multi-millionaire husband was pictured with his hands around her throat.

MailOnline can reveal that writer Kevin Goldman has been flown to London to interview associates and friends of both Nigella and her ex-husband Saatchi, 70.

However, Nigella has refused to take part in the article - following in the same vein as Gwyneth Paltrow - and has advised friends to steer clear.

Charles Saatchi, pictured here with Trinny Woodall at Scott's, is threatening to sue his ex-wife Nigella Lawson for $800,000 in an explosive case where he wants to reveal 'the truth' about their break-up

Nigella, who is currently in London filming The Taste UK for Britain's Channel 4, follows in the footsteps of Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow, who emailed all friends telling them not to partake in a tell-all Vanity Fair article.

This prompted Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter to retort the article would be published, adding: 'Well, she sort of forced my hand,

'We started a story on her. We have a very good writer and it’ll run.'

And speaking about the Nigella piece, a source said: 'No stone has been unturned, Vanity Fair wanted to get to the bottom of such an abrupt breakup and why the end of the marriage was agreed so quickly.

'Kevin has spoken to a lot of associates of both Nigella and Charles.'

The report will be published as it has been revealed noted art dealer Saatchi is threatening to sue his ex-wife for $800,000 
in an explosive court case where he wants to reveal ‘the truth’ about 
their break-up.

After 
being photographed with his hands around Nigella's throat 
outside an exclusive restaurant in June, the advertising guru accepted a
police caution and then went through a divorce from the ‘Domestic 
Goddess’.

But sources 
close to Saatchi have revealed that despite his formal admission of
assault he is now furious he has been widely reviled for the incident 
and is determined to publicise ‘the truth’ about the ‘strangling’  
pictures taken outside Scott’s in  London’s Mayfair.

The full details of his allegations about Nigella's behaviour cannot be made public for legal reasons, but have been strongly denied by her spokesman and her lawyers.

But Saatchi’s claims could now be revealed at London’s High Court after his lawyers sent a legal letter to his former wife’s solicitors warning that he was poised to sue her for around half a million pounds in a bid to clear his name.

The chillingly formal letter lays out serious allegations against the popular cook and claims her actions have cost her former husband a fortune.

It warns that if she refuses to settle the matter voluntarily, legal action in court will ensue.

Saatchi, who was Nigella's second husband, initially attempted to dismiss the shocking photographs that killed off his ten-year marriage as a ‘playful tiff’. He then went on to say ‘my actions were not violent’ and that he was ‘disappointed’ Nigella had not publicly said he had ‘never abused her physically in any way’.

Given that he has an estimated $161million fortune thanks to his successful career and extensive art collection, the sum of $800,000 involved in his dispute with Nigella is negligible.

But a source close to Saatchi said: 
‘Charles has been painted as the villain in all this – millions of 
people are convinced he was assaulting Nigella outside the restaurant.

‘But there are very genuine reasons for why he was holding on to her.

‘She has never given a public account of what was happening.

‘He has just been damned by the photographs, her silence, and his acceptance of a police caution – which he did only to protect her from a lengthy probe by officers. But he has never been able to explain the truth about what was going on.’

The couple’s marriage ended in a brief hearing just seven weeks after the incident at Scott’s. Miss Lawson, who has a £20million fortune of her own and two teenage children from her first marriage, had petitioned for divorce on the grounds of Saatchi’s ‘unreasonable behaviour’, saying the marriage had ‘irretrievably broken down’.

The couple had married in 2003 following the death of Miss Lawson’s first husband, broadcaster and journalist John Diamond, from throat cancer in 2001.

On a ‘statement of truth’ she signed as part of the separation from Saatchi, in reply to a question about how her husband’s behaviour had affected her health she answered: ‘Not applicable.’

Miss Lawson’s spokesman last night refused to comment on the latest development in the saga. But a source close to the television chef and bestselling food writer said: ‘The seriously defamatory claims are, of course, denied.’

Since their separation, Miss Lawson has been living in rented accommodation in Central London, and has been busy filming The Taste for ABC.

Saatchi, who lives in London, has been married three times. In recent months he has been doing his best to forget his marital woes by repeatedly dining out with glamorous journalist and television fashion expert Trinny Woodall – which has included repeated trips to Scott’s restaurant.
