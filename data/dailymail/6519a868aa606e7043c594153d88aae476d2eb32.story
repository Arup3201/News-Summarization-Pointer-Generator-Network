West Ham will take a look at Sweden international defender Marcus Nilsson in training this week.

The 26-year-old centre-back is out of contract and could replace Winston Reid, who is poised to leave the club.

Nilsson, who has one cap for his country,  has recently become a free agent following his release by Kalmar FF.

West Ham have cancelled the contract of Ricardo Vaz Te by mutual consent. 

Hull, QPR and Watford have been sounded out over the 28-year-old striker.

Vaz Te signed for the Hammers in January 2012 and in the Championship play-off final at Wembley in May that year.

The forward featured just five times for Sam Allardyce's side this season.
