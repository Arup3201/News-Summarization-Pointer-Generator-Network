A woman visiting a family tomb in Brazil had the shock of her life when a body emerged alive from a grave, waving its arms around.

The woman was at a cemetery in the suburb of Ferraz de Vasconcelos, Sao Paulo, when she heard faint noises then noticed the earth moving in a grave close by.

'I was terrified to see a man, who I thought was dead, trying to get out of the grave,' said the petrified woman, who asked not to be named.

A man has been rescued after being apparently buried alive at a cemetery in Sao Paulo, Brazil. A woman said she saw the soil moving while she was visiting a family tomb, before his arms emerged from the ground

The man's rescue emerged in video footage shown on Brazilian television. His current condition is unknown

'He had his head and hands out and was 
moving his arms around, trying to get out.'

The woman first ran away screaming, but returned and called the emergency services, who found the man half buried in a plot of earth.

She claimed that when she called police they did not believe her, and accused her of wasting their time and playing a joke.

'They kept questioning me asking: "Are you serious. This is a joke isn’t it,"' she said.

Eventually, unable to convince the authorities, she went to the cemetery office to plead with them to confirm with police that her discovery was real.

It is believed the dramatic rescue, which came to light today, happened about a week ago.

One
 video posted on YouTube showed the man wearing a grey jumper and with 
the bottom half of his body almost completely buried by soil.

In images shown on Brazil's Record TV, he appears almost lifeless but is found to be breathing by an emergency worker.

The man is now recuperating in the local hospital in Ferraz de Vasconcelos. A hospital source said he is 'coming back to life'. He will also be subjected to psychological tests.

Police believe the man, said to be a former city hall worker, was involved in a fight in another part of the city, where he was badly beaten by his attackers until he passed out and was taken to the cemetery by his assailants.

It is believed they then threw him into a empty grave which was partly filled with earth.

When the victim regained consciousness, he began making groaning noises which alerted the woman who found him.

Officers said they are convinced more than one person was involved in the assault, adding it was a 'despicable vendetta' that could have ended in tragedy if the woman had not chosen to visit her family's grave.

The attack is the second of its kind in Brazil in the last three months.

In September, a homeless man who was beaten over the head with a shovel by three teenagers in the Brazilian capital Rio de Janeiro was found buried alive on the city's Leblon Beach.

The teenage attackers also tried to suffocate the man with a plastic bag before stripping him naked then burying him in the sand in the early hours.

A witness to the assault reported the crime anonymously but the man, who was taken to hospital but not identified, died after being rescued by police. The suspects were arrested at the scene.
