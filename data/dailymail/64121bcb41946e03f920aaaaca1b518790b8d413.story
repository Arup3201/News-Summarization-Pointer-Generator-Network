The wallet of a German soldier killed on the battlefield during the First World War will finally be returned to his family after 100 years, thanks to the efforts of two Britons who set out to 'do the right thing'.

Friends Ivor White, 85, from North Tyneside, and Dennis Picton, who now lives in Australia, have spent the last six months tracing the family of the soldier, who was killed around 1914.

The wallet - pierced by the very bullet that killed its owner - belonged to Herman Karl Ernst Musold and contains a German Iron Cross military medal, a picture of Kaiser Wilhelm II and payment coupons.

Detective work: Ivor White from North Tyneside has tracked down the grandson of a German soldier killed in 1914, whose wallet has been in his family for 100 years

Patriotic: The wallet contained an Iron Cross medal, a book of coupons and a picture of Kaiser Wilhelm II

It was picked up from the battlefield by Vic Garside - Mr White's step-father, who was a driver in the Royal Army Service Corps, and has been kept by his family in Tyneside ever since.

But he was unsure how to trace the original owner's family, until Mr Picton offered to help.

'We got chatting and I showed him the wallet and he became very interested in it.

'He said he'd try and trace the original owner's family and sure enough, he has.

'I didn't think it could be done but they seem to be delighted we got in touch.'

Mr Picton, who lives in Adelaide, said: 'I scoured the internet and came up with the addresses of archives in Germany.

'The first one had seen its records destroyed by floods in the 1970s, but eventually I located one which deals with the history of those who fought for the German army.'

The pair were eventually able to trace the soldier's grandson, Wolfgang Musold, who lives in Rathenow, a small town in the district of Havelland in Brandenburg.

Identity: The official papers carried by the soldier name him as Herman Karl Ernst Musold

Historic: Ivor White is pleased he can return the war memorabilia to the soldier's family

The town is reportedly the place where Adolf Hitler was secretly buried alongside Eva Braun, as well as Joseph Goebbels and his family.

Letters have been exchanged and Mr White is preparing to post the wallet back to Mr Musold.

Mr Picton said: 'I am pleased for Ivor in that he was really keen to find the man's family.

'He wanted to get the stuff back and I am sure the relatives will be very pleased to have a bit of family history back.'

Mr White added: 'I'm glad they'll get it back. It seemed the right thing to do.'
