A handyman has been left with a potentially dangerous hole in his head after three operations to repair his skull were cancelled.

Brain tumour patient, Steve Taylor, 40, has had to wear a hard hat to protect his brain since part of his skull was removed in January.

Mr Taylor had surgery to remove a life-threatening growth from his brain in December 2012.

He then needed a second operation a month later when he contracted an infection.

Steve Taylor, 40, has been left with a hole in his skull for months because the NHS has repeatedly cancelled the reconstructive surgery he needs

Surgeons removed part of his skull to treat the infection - leaving Mr Taylor with an inch-and-a-half long hole in his head.

A date for the procedure to reconstruct his skull has been set three times in the last two months - only for doctors to cancel every operation at the last minute.

The father-of-three, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: ‘You prepare yourself, you make arrangements for time off work and then you find it’s been cancelled.

‘I just want to get it over with so I can get on with my life.’

Mr Taylor’s operation was initially scheduled for September 30 at University Hospital of North Staffordshire.

Mr Taylor had surgery to remove a brain tumour in December 2012 but a month later he developed an infection so had to have part of his skull removed while it was treated. University Hospital of North Staffordshire has apologised for cancelling his reconstructive surgery

But he was left devastated after medics sent him a letter informing him it was cancelled just days before he was due to be admitted to the hospital.

A second date was then set for October 21, but that was also postponed,

The procedure was then due to take place last week but Mr Taylor was told it had to be cancelled again because the hospital had no beds available for him.

The cancellations mean Mr Taylor has been forced to return to his estate maintenance job without  having had the surgery, because his sick pay was about to be cut.

Mr Taylor said: 'You prepare yourself, you make arrangements for time off work and then you find it's been cancelled. I just want to get it over with so I can get on with my life'

He said: ‘My doctor told me I shouldn’t be back at work but how can I afford to be off work?’

Mr Taylor says it is dangerous for him to be at work as he is in an environment where he could easily suffer a knock to his head.

His wife, Janine, 48, a Stoke-on-Trent city councillor, is blaming the delays on the number of patients the hospital is treating from outside its catchment area.

She said: ‘The UHNS management needs to get its act together, they are letting everyone down.

‘UNHS assured the council it could cope with extra patients and it wouldn’t affect local people’s operations. So why are so many having theirs cancelled?’

Mr Taylor's operation has now been booked in again for November 25 and he is desperately hoping that this time it will go ahead

Hospital bosses have apologised to Mr Taylor and blamed the third cancellation on an increase in emergency patients.

Vanessa Gardener, chief operating officer at UNHS, said: ‘I’d like to offer our apologies to Mr Taylor for the cancellation of his recent operation.

‘This was due to an increase in emergency patients on that day.

‘The trust has plans to reduce the impact emergency patients have on scheduled operations.

‘However, providing major trauma services is important to ensure specialist services are retained in Staffordshire, rather than them having to journey elsewhere.’

Mr Taylor’s operation has now been rescheduled for a fourth time and is due to take place on November 25.
