On the way up: Dr Liam Fox is set for a key role in the Cabinet ahead of next year's General Election 

Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox was last night tipped for a dramatic return to the political front line in a Cabinet reshuffle this week.

Senior MPs say David Cameron is considering giving Right-winger Dr Fox a key role in the run-up to next year’s General Election.

The move emerged as the Prime Minister planned a radical ministerial shake-up, with major promotions for leading women Conservative MPs.

Dr Fox was Defence Secretary for the first 18 months of the Coalition, but was forced to resign in disgrace in October 2011 in a row over his dealings with his best man and former associate Adam Werritty.

Werritty, a lobbyist who did not have security clearance, accompanied Dr Fox on at least 18 foreign business trips.

Dr Fox’s resignation came after a week of revelations about his relationship with Werritty, including disclosures that his friend’s activities were funded by firms and individuals that potentially stood to benefit from Government decisions.

In his resignation letter to the Prime Minister, Dr Fox said he had ‘mistakenly allowed the distinction between my personal interest and my Government activities to become blurred’.

Conservative insiders say Dr Fox has impressed with his ‘diligence and loyalty’ since leaving the Cabinet and deserved a recall. 

His return would also placate restive Eurosceptic Tory MPs who feel under-represented in a Government dominated by metropolitan friends of Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne.

A former Minister said: ‘Liam has paid the price for a silly mistake and deserves his return. The Government will be stronger for his experience.’ 

Treasury Minister Nicky Morgan is expected to join the Cabinet, while Employment Minister Esther McVey and Education Minister Liz Truss are also set to be promoted.

Mr Cameron’s overhaul will see the final Cabinet exit of former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, 74, who was first made a Minister 42 years ago. 

Fellow veteran, Chief Whip Sir George Young, 73, will also step down. 

Universities Minister David Willetts is also tipped to make way for a new face.

Mr Osborne’s ally Greg Hands is the favourite to succeed Sir George, an appointment which would mark a key step in Osborne’s growing influence. 

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is thought to be vulnerable, despite a rearguard action to save him by fellow Right-wingers.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is expected to hang on to his Cabinet seat, largely thanks to his appeal as a bluff Northerner. 

Similarly, despite a whispering campaign against Ulster Secretary Theresa Villiers, she is expected to survive to head off a row about her being a victim of ‘sexism’.

Mr Osborne, Foreign Secretary William Hague and Home Secretary Theresa May are all expected to remain in place.

Cameron had hoped to welcome back ‘plebgate’ MP Andrew Mitchell, the former Chief Whip who resigned after swearing at a policeman who refused to let him cycle through the gates at Downing Street.

Mr Mitchell is said to be in talks to end libel proceedings over the case, but it is thought the failure to resolve the issue has cost him a return this week.
