An enraged mob of anti-American protesters shouting 'Yankee, go home!' and 'Damn America' were caught on video roughing up three unarmed US Navy sailors Wednesday in Istanbul.

The tense confrontation took place near where the sailors' warship, the USS Ross, was docked on an inlet of the Bosphorus Strait in the Black Sea.

A dozen or more members of the nationalist group Youth Association of Turkey (TGB) hurled insults at the American servicemen, calling them killers and saying they should get out of Turkey.

Under attack: Three unarmed US Navy sailors were attacked by a group of anti-American protesters in Istanbul Wednesday 

Violent protest: Youth Association of Turkey (TGB) members shouted at the American servicemen, calling them killers and said they should get out of Turkey. At one point, the verbal abuse turned physical 

Rage: One of the activists hurled a rock at a bespectacled sailor carrying a backpack

The protesters, who at one point unfurled a TGB banner emblazoned with Turkish founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's image, threw red paint at the sailors, pelted them with rocks, shoved them around and briefly succeeded in putting white sacks over their heads. 

AFP reported that the use of white bags was a reference to an incident from 2003 when US forces in northern Iraq arrested a group of Turkish soldiers, placed hoods over their heads and detained them for three days.

The incident stirred strong nationalist sentiment in Turkey and was dramatized in the 2006 Turkish blockbuster Valley of the Wolves: Iraq. 

'Soldiers from the occupying country think they can walk around freely in Eminonu,' association spokesman Melik Dibek said, referring to the neighborhood where the incident occurred. 

'It's obvious why they've anchored here —because of their ambitions in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. American imperialism is the reason why the Middle East has turned into a chamber of fire.' 

Capt. Greg Hicks, a spokesman for the US European Command, said the Navy men, who were in plainclothes, were not hurt and were safely back aboard the guide-missile destroyer docked nearby, but that shore leave for its sailors was canceled for the remainder of the day.

The US Embassy in Ankara condemned the attack on Twitter and said it had no doubt that most Turks would reject such an action.

'The video showing an assault on three visiting American sailors is appalling,' the multi-part statement read.  'While we respect the right to peaceful protest and freedom of expression, we condemn today’s attack in Istanbul, and have no doubt the vast majority of Turks would join us in rejecting an action that so disrespects Turkey’s reputation for hospitality.' 

TGB members accused the sailors of being agents of American imperialism and meddling in regional affairs

Dogan news agency said Turkish police have detained 12 people, including one woman, in connection with the incident

The US Navy also addressed the incident in a statement posted online Wednesday saying that US Embassy staff are investigating the attack on the sailors.

'We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Turkey for many years,' read the statement from US 6th Fleet. 'As NATO allies, we share common interests, and this incident will not diminish that strong relationship.

'Turkish ports have long been very popular destinations for U.S. Navy ships, and our Sailors have enjoyed the warm hospitality that has traditionally been extended.'

Anti-American sentiment in Turkey is not widespread, but some Turks accuse the United States of meddling in regional affairs.

Escaped unharmed: US Navy officials said the three sailors were not hurt in the scuffle 

US Navy and US Embassy staff in Turkey have condemned the violent attack on American sailors 

In hot pursuit: The angry mob chased the outnumbered sailors down the street, shouting 'Yankee, go home!'

In Washington, Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, called the attack 'ugly and disturbing.' He said the attackers, whom he called street thugs, 'bring great discredit upon the Turks and the Turkish reputation for hospitality.'

He said the assault 'appears to be a one-off incident' and that he doesn't believe it will disrupt US-Turkish relations.

The Navy said it would continue to coordinate with Turkish authorities to review security procedures for future ship visits.

Shore leave: The sailors were from the USS Ross, which was docked on an inlet of the Bosphorus Strait in the Black Sea

Dogan news agency said Turkish police have detained 12 people, including one woman, in connection with the incident.

One sailor, a bespectacled young man in a brown jacket,tried to ignore the protesters to no avail. Another worked unsuccessfully to push off the protesters. When the sailors couldn't get away, they began to walk and then run away down a sidewalk.

A video of the incident shot by the association and posted online showed the protesters chasing them down the street, shouting 'Yankee, go home!'

Vice President Joe Biden will travel to Istanbul November 21 for talks with Turkish leaders.
