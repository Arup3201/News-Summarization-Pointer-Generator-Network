One of the victims named in recent indictment against two ‘revenge porn’ kingpins has opened up about her struggles after a topless picture of her was put online.

Kayla Laws, 25, of Studio City, CA, is one of eight accusers against Hunter Moore and Charlie Evans after discovering she was featured on their IsAnyOneUp.com website.

She spoke out this week after the two men were indicted in California for running the site, which has since been taken over by an anti-bullying group.

Devastated: Kayla Laws said she felt betrayed, and that finding her picture on the site hit her 'like a ton of bricks'

‘You think that it can't happen to you, but it can,’ she said in an interview with KNBC. ‘I was just so damaged by it. I just wanted to stay in my room. It just all hit me like a ton of bricks.’

The ‘it’ she refers to is a picture of hers revealing one breast that was uploaded to the site in October 2011, it took nine days to get the picture removed – but it had also been mass-texted to almost everyone, she recalled.

‘They would message me saying, ‘Hey, you look good, baby.’

She has been on a crusade to find justice ever since, and has been joined by her mother dubbed ‘The Erin Brockovich of revenge porn.’

‘I'm so happy that, finally, something's happening,’ Charlotte Laws told the station. ‘Revenge porn can be anything. It's really just about hurting and humiliating people and trying to ruin their lives.’

Daughter Kayla will have to ‘monitor the Internet for the rest of her life,’ she added.

Moore and Evens were charged Thursday several counts accusing them of hacking into people’s computers and email accounts, taking images and posting them online without permission.

Kayla Laws’ picture was stolen from her email, she found out about the betrayal from a friend.

‘You are topless on a website. It is called isanyoneup.com,’ Charlotte Laws recalled her daughter telling her in a post on XOJane.

The aspiring actress was devastated, crying – she had never given the pictures to anyone, she said.

Requests to take down the picture were rebuffed by Moore, Charlotte Laws wrote, so she and her daughter began ‘Operation No Moore.’

Validation of their campaigning came when a bill was signed into law late last year that makes revenge porn a crime in the state.

The two men were arrested this week and each charged with conspiracy, seven counts of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information and seven counts of aggravated identity theft, records showed.

Both men face a mandatory two year sentence if convicted of identity theft, and five years for each of the other charges if found guilty.

The trial is expected to start later this year.
