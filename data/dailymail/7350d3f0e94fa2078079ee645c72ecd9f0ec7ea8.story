Customers have returned bags worth almost $20,000 to iconic bag makers Hermès after complaining that the expensive accessories smell of marijuana.

The bags have been returned from shops to boutiques in Paris after staff at the luxury fashion brand noticed there was a problem with a 'badly tanned' batch of leather from a supplier.

It is believed that the tanning process can make the leather bags smell like cannabis when it is warmed up in a hot car or when left in direct sunlight.

Hermès iconic bag, the Birkin - named after singer and actress Jane Birkin - is one of the bags which are affected and can cost up to $18,900.

Crocodile skin versions of the bag can cost up to $60,000 but are not thought to be affected by the problem. 

A source told Page Six: 'Owners are returning the Hermès bags back to boutiques across the US, including the Madison Avenue store, saying they smell of skunk.

English actress and singer was sat next to Hermès chief executive Jean-Louis Dumas on a flight from Paris to London in 1981.

She was putting her straw bag in the overhead compartment when the contents fell on to the floor.

She told Mr Dumas that she could not find a leather bag that she liked, so he had one personally made for her. 

The bag is now a symbol of wealth, with some types of Birkin selling for up to $100,000.

At one point, customers faced a six-year waiting list to get their hands on the exclusive handbag. 

'The bags are being sent back to Paris as nobody knows quite how to deal with this embarrassing situation.'

The marijuana-smell could be a worldwide problem as Hermès are distributed to boutiques in limited quantities and are often on back order.

The bags affected include the Birkin, which can cost up to $18,900 in leather, the Kelly, costing up to $9,250, and the Elan clutch, worth $4,580.

Hermès has a reputation for making the best bags on the market, with customers including the likes of Victoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian.

The smell is said to affect bags purchased in 2013 and this year.

Customers have been told that Hermès that the bags have to be returned to the company's headquarters in Paris so the bad-smelling leather panels can be removed and the entire bag rebuilt.

Customers' bags are reportedly being returned to Hermès head office in Paris to be rebuilt without the bad-smelling leather panels

The pungent smell has become such a problem that fashion-loving women have taken to internet forums to discuss the issue. 

One owner of a Hermès Kelly bag posted on PurseBlog: 'After riding in the car with her for about 30 minutes, I smelled what I thought was a dead skunk. 

'Another 30 minutes later I could still smell the dead skunk, and I thought it was odd, but never imagined it could be my bag. 

'I keep [it] in an armoire... When I opened the cabinet door this morning, the smell hit me, and I immediately knew it was the bag.'

Hermes did not comment.
