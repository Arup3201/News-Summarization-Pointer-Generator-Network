A mother spent three hours performing CPR on her daughter's blind pet chicken after it fell into a swimming pool.

Blind since birth, Chooky Wooky was pulled lifeless from a family pool in Sydney after she wandered too close to the water - and was blown in by a strong gust of wind.

It seemed there was no hope for the soggy pile of feathers that the sightless Chooky Wooky had become - but Roberta Rapo wasn't giving up on the family pet just yet.

And for the next three hours she pumped the tiny hen's chest, hoping she could bring life back to the chicken, her 14-year-old daughter Rayna's special pet.

As a distressed Rayna looked on anxiously, Mrs Rapo applied CPR but it seemed that all hope was lost - until with a faint 'cluck' Chooky Wooky started moving again.

Remarkably, there seemed to be no sign of brain damage, leaving Mrs Rapo and her daughter to believe that the chicken had a tiny amount of life left in her when she was brought out of the pool.

Determined:Â  Mrs Rapo pumped the tiny hen's chest, hoping she could bring life back to her 14-year-old daughter Rayna's, right, special pet, until with a faint 'cluck' Chooky Wooky started moving again

Back to normal: Rayna Rapo with her parents and her beloved chicken. Mrs Rapo said Chooky Wooky was an important companion for Rayna who has autism

Mother and daughter rushed the bird indoors and turned a hair dryer onto her to put some fluffiness back into her feathers.

Was Chooky thankful? No doubt about it, because a short time later, after being given the 'all clear' by a vet, she laid a celebratory egg.

Mrs Rapo told Sydney's Daily Telegraph that Chooky Wooky was an important companion for Rayna who has autism and is more comfortable around animals than humans.

The family had taken the unwanted blind hen into their home as a permanent resident - and one of Rayna's closest friends.

'She's my little baby,' Rayna told the paper.

'I raised her, I love her and I love chickens.'

As for the hen's remarkable recovery, Rayna commented: 'She's a miracle chicken.'
