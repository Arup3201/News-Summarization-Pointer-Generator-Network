Hate: Muslim Cleric Abu Qatada, pictured arriving home in London after being released from prison, justified attacks on British civilians, according to the dossier

Hate preacher Abu Qatada issued orders to kill British and American civilians after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, according to a secret MI5 report seen by The Mail on Sunday.

The Security Service document has raised questions as to why Qatada – who the British Government has tried and failed to deport to Jordan – has not been put on trial in the UK for inciting murder.

The report is marked ‘secret UK eyes only’ and claims Qatada is the author of a fatwa that ‘encourages Muslims to take part in jihad against the West’.

The Qatada fatwa also gives religious justification to the 9/11 attacks in the US which killed 2,977 civilians.

The MI5 case file on Qatada was discovered abandoned in the British ambassador’s residence in Tripoli by The Mail on Sunday after the toppling of Colonel Gaddafi last year.

It says: ‘In arguing the legal case for the attacks of September 11, Abu Qatada advocates fighting jihad against America and the West.

‘However, he goes further to include not only the aggressor (the American government), but anybody associated with the aggressor (its civilians) as prospective targets.’

Qatada, who has been described as Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, remains on bail in London after Home Secretary Theresa May lost the latest round in her battle to deport him to Jordan, where he is wanted for his alleged roles in two bomb plots against foreigners.

The court ruling – which means the extremist preacher is free to walk the streets of London for six hours a day – prompted Prime Minister David Cameron to say he was ‘completely fed up’ with the Qatada problem.

MI5 says Qatada issued the fatwa about ten years ago, when he was on the run in the UK from MI5 and counter-terrorism police trying to detain him under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.

If the document had been published in this country, Qatada could be prosecuted for incitement to murder.

Last night politicians involved in the long-running case and senior lawyers said they had not been told of the fatwa and called for Qatada to be prosecuted here.

Ken Macdonald QC, the former director of public prosecutions, said of the fatwa: ‘You need to establish that he actually said those words.

‘If he did say those words then you are possibly looking into an investigation for incitement to murder.’

Labour MP Keith Vaz, the chairman of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘If Qatada has committed a crime then he should be prosecuted here.

‘I think this fatwa needs to be looked at to see if he has broken the law here. I am appalled by this.’

And one senior prosecution lawyer said that it was important to establish whether MI5 had shared this intelligence with the Crown Prosecution Service to properly consider a prosecution in this country.

MI5 says the fatwa was issued after Qatada’s infamous decree in 1995, where he gave religious authority to the killing of women and children in Algeria by Islamists during the civil war there.

That fatwa was used by the Algerian terrorist group, the GIA, to slaughter thousands of civilians, including women and children, say experts.

The MI5 document says Qatada was linked to the Hamburg terror cell who went on to commit the 9/11 terrorist atrocities.

The dossier says 18 video tapes of Qatada’s sermons were found in the Hamburg flat used by three of the hijackers, including ring-leader Mohammed Atta.

The so-called shoe bomber Richard Reid – who tried to blow up a transatlantic airliner – was also a follower of Qatada, says the document.

Last night Mr Vaz said: ‘I still believe that the best place for him to be tried is Jordan. 

‘I think the Home Secretary needs to go to Jordan and ask the King to make that change in law that prevents Qatada from being deported. It is better for him to be in Jordan than be walking around in Wembley.’

Qatada was released on bail last week subject to a 16-hour-a-day curfew and other restrictions.

The Special Immigration Appeals Commission, which heard the case, said Mrs May had failed to satisfy the court that Qatada would be given a fair trial.

Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile QC, who was the previous Government watchdog on counter-terrorism, said: ‘I deplore this fatwa. I regard Abu Qatada as an extremely undesirable resident in the United Kingdom, but we have to apply the law.’

He added that the fatwa alone may not be enough to prosecute Qatada in the UK.

The Crown Prosecution Service said it was unable to comment on the alleged fatwa.

A senior Whitehall source said that all information relating to Qatada had been frequently reviewed by police to see whether it was possible to prosecute him.

The US State Department refused to comment about whether it had considered extraditing Qatada over allegations that he had incited the murder of American citizens.

Last year The Mail on Sunday found other documents abandoned in the ambassador’s residence in Tripoli which revealed that Labour had lied over the Lockerbie disaster and had kept Libyan dissidents under house arrest in the UK at the request of Gaddafi.
