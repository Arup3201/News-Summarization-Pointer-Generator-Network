Tony Blair last night admitted the Iraq War had made him a hate figure in Britain – and acknowledged it had failed to make the world a safer place.

In a frank interview to mark the tenth anniversary of the conflict, the former prime minister said members of the public were still ‘very abusive’ towards him over his decision to take Britain to war alongside George W. Bush.

Mr Blair acknowledged that the situation in Iraq was still ‘not nearly what it should be’, with the country suffering almost daily terrorist attacks.

But he said he had ‘given up’ trying to persuade people he had made the right decision. And he insisted the situation would have been even worse if Saddam Hussein had been left in power.

He made no apology for the conflict, which cost 179 British lives and led to the deaths of more than 100,000 Iraqis. And he suggested the West was in the middle of a ‘generational’ conflict which may also require military intervention in Syria and Iran.

His comments sparked anger among opponents of the war. Reg Keys, whose son Tom was one of six Red Caps killed by an Iraqi mob in 2003, said he remained ‘very bitter and angry’ about Mr Blair.

‘As far as I’m concerned he should be dragged in shackles to the International Criminal Court for war crimes,’ he said. ‘We invaded a sovereign country and went against the United Nations.

‘When I look at my son’s grave I think, what did he die for? It is a total waste. Blair shouldn’t be surprised that people shout at him in the street – this will follow him to the end of his days.

‘It would help if he said sorry but I 
don’t think he will ever apologise.’ Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir 
Menzies Campbell said Mr Blair had made ‘fundamental errors’ in thinking
he could influence the Bush government and in ignoring UN rules.

He
said: ‘There is hardly anyone now in Britain or even the United States 
who is willing to defend the action against Iraq which had such adverse 
consequences in the Middle East, but more particularly for the 
reputation and influence of the UK.

‘Mr
Blair should not be surprised that people are still angry. We should 
never forget that exactly ten years ago one million people marched 
through London in opposition to his policy.’

Mr
Blair made the comments in an interview on BBC2’s Newsnight.

Asked 
whether he minded if ‘people call you a liar, some people call you a war
criminal, protesters follow you; it’s difficult to walk down the street
in a country’, he replied: ‘It really doesn’t matter whether it’s taken
its toll on me.

‘The fact 
is yes there are people who will be very abusive, by the way I do walk 
down the street and by the way I won an election in 2005 after Iraq.

'However, yes it remains extremely divisive and very difficult.’

He
asked his critics to consider how the world would look if Saddam 
Hussein was still in power, adding: ‘In the end sometimes you come to a 
decision where whichever choice you take the consequences are difficult 
and the choice is ugly. This was one such case.’

Mr Blair insisted he had given up trying to persuade his critics that ordering the 2003 invasion was the right thing to do
