Brendan Rodgers insists Liverpool will have ‘no fear’ at the Etihad today even though Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure believes all Europe is scared of Manuel Pellegrini’s free-scoring team.

City take on Barclays Premier League leaders  Liverpool in the clash of the Boxing Day programme having already racked up an astonishing 50 goals at home in all competitions this season.

And Rodgers, whose team head the table on Christmas Day for the first time since 2008, knows their title credentials will be given the ultimate test.

City have won every game at home in the league this season but Rodgers watched Bayern Munich beat them 2-0 in the Champions League in September and said: ‘We go there with no fear. We outplayed them last year, home and away.

'We had two draws and we should have won both games. But we will go there with every respect for them. I believe with the squad they have, it is their title to lose.

'We will go there and be aggressive. We had 23 shots on goal against Cardiff. They will have seen from the  Cardiff and Tottenham games that we can score goals.’

So can City, and their form has even caught the attention of Champions League opponents Barcelona, according to former Nou Camp star Toure.

‘After the draw I had a call from one of my old team-mates from Spain who was quite disappointed. In the past they would be confident they would beat anyone. But they are afraid of us.

‘We score goals and it is total attack. So it’s going to be a tough game for them.’

City’s away form has held them back in the league this season but at home they remain formidable.

The last team to keep a clean sheet against them there in any competition was Liverpool, almost two years ago in the League Cup.

City must find a way to stop 19-goal Luis Suarez but not even that worries Toure.

‘Suarez is one of the best in the world right now,’ he said.

‘But we can beat the best teams in our own stadium by playing great football and scoring goals. We’re not the sort of team that is fearful of opponents.’
