Terrified passengers were forced to flee an aircraft via its emergency slide after a bird was sucked into an engine, sparking a fire moments before the plane was due to take off.

The bird strike occurred as the Jet Blue Airways Flight 704 was taxiing at Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico on Saturday night.

In an interview with ABC News, passenger James Schiano Jr. described a scene of chaos inside the cabin: ‘People started screaming and people were trying to bust open the emergency exit with their arms. The flight attendants came and held everybody back.’

First-row passenger Raymond Talavera said he was alerted to trouble when he heard an ‘enormous boom'.

He told ABC News: ‘I looked (out the window) and I was able to see the engine basically exploded – smoke everywhere.’ 

The passengers and crew fled to safety after the plane was brought to an emergency halt and its evacuation chute deployed. 

Puerto Rico airport authority official Rolando Padua said 186 passengers were aboard the Airbus A321, which was heading to JFK International Airport in New York.

A statement released by JetBlue said the aircraft was carrying six crew members.

At least three people suffered minor injuries during the emergency evacuation.

Passengers were put on a different plane later in the evening and they arrived in New York on Sunday morning.
