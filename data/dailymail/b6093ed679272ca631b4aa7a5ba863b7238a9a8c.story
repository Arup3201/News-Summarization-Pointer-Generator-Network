The past, present and future of British heavyweight boxing were at Wimbledon on Saturday afternoon as David Haye and Anthony Joshua took their seats on Centre Court.

Former world champion Haye is currently regaining his fitness in the gym as he plots a comeback this autumn while Joshua returns to action in Liverpool on July 12.

Joshua's fellow gold medal winner, Nicola Adams, was also in SW19 and posted a 
picture of herself with Haye and with former England captain David 
Beckham.

Having been crowned Olympic 
super-heavyweight champion in London two years ago, Joshua has won his 
first six fights as a professional.

He takes on veteran Matt Skelton at the Echo Arena next month.

Haye, meanwhile, 
has not fought since he stopped Dereck Chisora at Upton Park in 2012 and
 twice pulled out of a fight with Tyson Fury.

His career looked to be over after undergoing surgery on his shoulder last year but he recently revealed he plans to fight on.
