Seattle out-played, out-gunned and out-manned the Denver Broncos on the way to proving defense really does win championships.

The Seahawks league-best defense intercepted Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning twice and quarterback Russell Wilson played like a veteran in a dominant performance giving the team its first Super Bowl championship.

Denver's miscues doomed it from the very start. A bad snap for a safety, two interceptions and two fumbles - Seattle scored almost all of its points off turnovers.

'The only way we could say we were the best defense was to take down the best offense,' said linebacker Bobby Wagner.

And take them down they did.

Manning was stifled by the Seahawks' hard hitting 'legion of boom' defense all game. Swarming defenders knocked Broncos players all over the field and forced three turnovers that led to points.

The future hall of fame quarterback never had a chance. Seattle coach Pete Carroll's defense intercepted Manning twice in the first half, with linebacker Malcolm Smith returning the second pick 69 yards for a touchdown.

Smith won Super Bowl MVP honors for the play.

'I always imagined myself making great plays, never thought about being the MVP,' Smith said.

He overthrew receivers all night, threw wobbly passes and rarely had time to scan the field as Seattle's unrelenting pass rush constantly kept him under pressure.

His counterpart Wilson looked like an old pro completing 18 of 25 passes for 206 yards, two touchdowns and zero interceptions, as well as three rushes for 26 yards for a quarterback rating of 123.1 - among the highest in Super Bowl history.

By comparison, Denver running back Knowshon Moreno was held to 17 yards on five carries.

'We've been relentless all season,' Wilson said. 'Having that mentality of having a championship day every day. At the end of the day, you want to play your best football and that is what we did today.'

Coach Pete Carroll had been repeating the mantra that every day is a championship day since the start of training camp, and it paid off.

The scoring started when an errant Broncos snap led to a safety on the first play from scrimmage to give Seattle a 2-0 lead and the ball.

Seattle’s second play from scrimmage resulted in a 30 yard run from speedy wide receiver Percy Harvin, notable because he was playing in only his third game all season after suffering through a multitude of injuries and recovering from offseason hip surgery.

Harvin only had 38 total yards all season, but amassed 137 yards on the night.

Wilson overcame early nerves to completed his next two passes and carried the ball twice for 10 yards to set up a Stephen Hauschka 31 yard field goal that gave the Seahawks a 5-0 lead with 10:22 left in the first quarter.

Seattle tacked on a second field goal 
following their next drive to take an 8-0 lead.

The Broncos' offensive struggles 
continued through the first quarter. They went three and out their next 
drive, punctuated by an earth shattering hit from Kam Chancellor on 
Broncos receiver Demarius Thomas.

The Broncos next drive ended when Chancellor intercepted an errant Manning throw that resulted in Seattle's first touchdown.

The second quarter saw much of the same, as Seattle methodically drove down the field down the field and capitalized on a Denver pass 
interference penalty in the end zone to take a 15-0 lead on a Marshawn 
Lynch 1 yard touchdown run.

Lynch ended the game with 39 yards on 15 carries.

Wilson completed 9 of 14 passes for 94 yards in the first half and ran for 10
more yards on two carries while safety Kam Chancellor and Seattle’s defense held the Broncos scoreless.

'It's all about making history,' said All-Pro safety Earl Thomas. 'This was a dominant performance from top to bottom.'

The second quarter looked to be a welcome change for the five-time MVP, but it was only an illusion.

Manning finally put together a sustained drive, moving the ball 49 yards over 16 plays while completing 7 of 9 passes for 45 yards before throwing one of those 'ducks' Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman referred to in the days leading up to the game.

Manning finally looked to have 
established himself before his arm was hit on a short pass intended for 
running back Knowshon Moreno.

The wobbly throw was picked off by Seahawks linebacker Malcolm Smith and returned 69 yards for a touchdown and a 22-0 lead for Seattle.

Manning's dismal first half was punctuated by another duck thrown on 4th and two with 1:01 left, it barely missed being intercepted. 

He finished the first half 17 of 23 for 104 
yards and was shown walking off the field with his tail between his legs
 before time even expired in the second quarter - one that will likely 
haunt him for many years.

'Certainly to finish this way is very disappointing. It's not an easy pill to swallow,' said Manning. 'I don't know if you ever really get over it.'

Off to the races: Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Percy Harvin (11) returns a kickoff for a touchdown to start the second half

The nightmare only continued in the 
second when Denver kick Matthew Prater went for hang time on the opening
 kick as he tried to give his coverage team enough time to get to the 
dangerous Harvin.

Harvin 
missed the NFC championship two weeks ago after suffering a concussion 
during an earlier playoff game, and clearly benefited from the rest.

He
 caught the ball at the 13-yard line and took off, blowing past three 
would-be tacklers and streaking down the middle of the field for the 
Super Bowl's signature play to this point.

The play put the Broncos championship parade plans to bed for good.

'This is an amazing team. Took us four 
years to get to this point, but they never have taken a step sideways,' 
coach Pete Carroll said. 'These guys would not take anything but winning
 this ballgame.'

Carroll's first championship as an NFL coach comes after failed stints with the New York Jets and New England Patriots saw him cast into the college ranks.

All Carroll did at the University of Southern California was win two national titles and produce one of the game's great dynasties during his nine years in charge.

He won the Super Bowl in his fourth year at the helm in Seattle.

Wilson threw a strike over the middle to receiver Jermaine Kearse later in the third quarter that he caught while spinning out of several tackles and ran into the endzone for a touchdown to make the score 36-0.

Manning found Thomas for a touchdown on the ensuing drive, one of the receiver's Super Bowl-record 13 receptions on the game, but it was too little too late.

He finished 33 of 47 for 266 yards, one touchdown and 266 yards.

Seattle stayed pedal to the medal on the next drive, with Wilson completing 5 of his 5 passes for 58 yards and his second touchdown of the game to make it 43-8 with 11:45 remaining in the game.

Richard Sherman, for all his bluster before the game, went out with a whimper when he injured his ankle early in the fourth quarter. He was taken off the field on a cart and returned later on crutches.

Oddly enough, Manning's 34 completions were a Super Bowl record, but his turnovers did a hole the Broncos never found a way out of - and it may be the last time he dons a uniform because of recurring neck injuries he will address in the offseason.

Oh, and, about the weather that so many people were concerned with for so many months - temperatures held steady in the mid-40s and the only thing resembling snow that came close to the field was a shower of confetti at the end.
