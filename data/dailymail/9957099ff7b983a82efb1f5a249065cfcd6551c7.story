The Apple Watch divided fashion opinions when it was unveiled just a month ago. 

GQ had its reservations about the fashion tech accessory, and even Alexandra Shulman was on the fence. But for Vogue.com and Marie Claire, it was love at first sight. 

Now Vogue China is the first fashion title to feature the gadget on its cover for November 2014.

Vogue China is the first fashion title in the world to style the Apple Watch on its cover, it was revealed today

The issue features supermodel Liu Wen wearing the device in an iconic moment when fashion meets technology.

Vogue stands unrivalled as the world's leading style bible, so this placement certainly solidifies the Apple Watch's fashion credentials. 

And certainly comes as no surprise that the wearable tech features on the version in China - where science and technology have developed rapidly in recent years.

Angelica Cheung, Editorial Director of Vogue China commented: 'As the very first fashion publication to feature the recently launched Apple Watch on its cover, Vogue China is following in the Vogue tradition of moving with the times, giving our readers the first glimpse of a pioneering piece of technology that also doubles as a highly covetable fashion accessory. 

'In its slick marriage of technology, fashion and lifestyle, the Apple Watch will have a significant impact on the way we live.  

'The look that David Sims and Karl Templer put together is fresh, modern and with good energy, fitting with the spirit of Vogue China which has been showcasing the best fashion around the world for the past 10 years.' 

On the cover Chinese supermodel Liu Wen models the 38mm Apple Watch Edition in 18-carat yellow gold, with a bright red modern buckle, styled by Karl Templer in a striped ensemble by Céline, and photographed by long time Vogue collaborator David Sims. 

When Apple unveiled its first wearable accessory to a high-profile crowd last month, it certainly proved to be the tech event with the biggest fashion buzz this year.

The item marks a brand new territory for the tech giant, who, for the first time ever, are targeting the style-conscious rather than tech-obsessed.

But the Apple Watch is less of a risk and more an organic step into the next phase of Apple's development. They recently hired ex Burberry boss Angela Ahrendts, YSL's CEO Paul Deneve and - crucially - Patrick Pruniaux, ex Tag Heuer.

The gadget, which must be paired with an iPhone, debuts next year and prices start from £216 in the UK.

It comes in three versions - sport, standard, and a luxury edition, with finishes including stainless steel and gold plated. The display is highly customisable and wrist bands range from leather and stainless steel to sports models in hues from pink to blue.

GQ's Daniel Dumas wrote at the time: 'The Apple Watch certainly has a lot going for it from a technological standpoint, but we'll never vouch for wearing a digital watch with a tux. If you have a special occasion coming up, opt for something classic... Remember; the Apple Watch is built to check emails. You don't want your wrist lighting up with a message from the CEO when you're toasting the groom.' 

The Apple Watch was unveiled just a month ago to mainly positive reactions

Meanwhile style bible Vogue.com was more open and complimentary in regards to its look.

'From a fashion point of view, the external aesthetic seemed neutral: neither super-stylish nor repellent. I would imagine that geeks would love it more than aesthetes,' writes Suzy Menkes.

'I suspect that I, as a non-digital specialist, would fail to use this device to its full capacity. But I like the idea of setting the visual aspects according to my mood. And perhaps my wardrobe.

'A bunch of violets to set off my purple outfits? Why not look at my watch - and dream.'

Alexandra Shulman, editor of British Vogue, was a little less convinced: 'It is immaculate in terms of how function meets design,' she said.

'The issue is really about how much people want to wear something so clearly, essentially an amazing gadget.'

Fashion editors were curious about an expected wearable accessory from fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff; a high-fashion smart bracelet from Intel; and a smart ring from Ringly.

'This is just the beginning. How long before there is a partnership with Marc Jacobs and Valentino to do more sophisticated faces?' said Lea Goldman, features and special projects reporter for Marie Claire.
