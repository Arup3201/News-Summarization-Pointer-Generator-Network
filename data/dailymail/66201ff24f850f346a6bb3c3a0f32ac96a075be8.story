The third American killed in the Germanwings plane crash in the French Alps has been identified as Robert Oliver Calvo.

Calvo, 37, was a U.S. citizen who lived with his wife and children in Barcelona, where he worked in real estate for Spanish design firm Desigual.

A frequent traveler, he was embarking on a business trip to Dusseldorf with Spanish colleague Laura Altamira when he boarded the doomed Airbus A320 on Tuesday.

The two other U.S. citizens among the 150 victims on the flight operated by Lufthansa's budget carrier were named yesterday as Booz Allen Hamilton contractor Yvonne Selke and her daughter, Emily.

Tragic: Married father Robert Oliver Calvo, 37, was the third American to die in the Germanwings crash

Calvo, who lived in Barcelona, worked for design firm Desigual and was traveling to Dusseldorf for work

According to Calvo's Facebook page, he was born in Rubí, in northeastern Spain.

He had two children, according to the New York Daily News. 

His American father told Reuters television on Thursday that he and his wife had been following the investigation into Tuesday's crash from their home in Spain.

'Some people feel better getting closer to where their loved ones might be,' said Robert Tansill Oliver, a 73-year-old retired English teacher who has lived in Barcelona since 1966.

'But in this case, we would like to go when something can be identified, one of their belongings can be identified, then of course we would like to go. But for the moment we prefer to be with our grandchildren and with the wife of our son to comfort them and be alongside them.'

Horrific: 150 people died when the Airbus A320 crashed into a mountain in the French Alps on Tuesday

Victim: Emily Selke, a recent Drexel University graduate, died alongside her mother Yvonne on the flight

The co-pilot of the Airbus A320 deliberately crashed the plane, a French prosecutor said on Thursday, and German police searched his home for clues to his reasons.

But prosecutor Brice Robin said 28-year-old Andreas Lubitz's act should not be called a suicide because it killed so many other people.

Robert Tansill Oliver urged the families who lost loved ones not to dwell on the final minutes of the fatal flight.

'I'd like to encourage them to think about the wonderful years that they have enjoyed of life together ... Think about the good moments, the wonderful moments, and, of course, think about the future,' he said.

State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said: 'We are continuing to review our records to determine whether any other U.S. citizens might have been on board the flight.'

Troubled: Questions have been raised asking why Andreas Lubitz got permission to fly after evidence of mental issues and distress. He locked the captain out of the cockpit and steadily drove the plane to crash
