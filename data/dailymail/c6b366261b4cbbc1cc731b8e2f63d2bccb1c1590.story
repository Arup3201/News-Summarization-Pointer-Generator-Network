An investment banker was found dead after attempting to climb the Northeast's highest peak on Monday afternoon - 24 hours after she called for help as she hiked through 100 mph winds.

Kate Matrosova, 32, arrived at the base of New Hampshire's 5,400ft Mount Madison at 5am on Sunday, dropped off by her husband Charlie Farhoodi, who is listed on LinkedIn as a Vice President at JP Morgan.

Within hours, she activated an emergency beacon amid treacherous conditions but a team was unable to locate her in the blizzard.

Her body was found 24 hours later. It appears she died of exposure to the extreme temperatures overnight.

She had been attempting to climb the Presidential Range of the White Mountains - which includes the highest peak in the Northeast - Mount Washington - elevation 6,300 feet 

Russia-born Matrosova, who lived in a $1 million apartment in Midtown Manhattan with Farhoodi, planned to climb to the top of  Madison before venturing across three other summits in the so-called Presidential Range, reports claim.

As the day progressed, the region was hit by winds exceeding 100mph and temperatures plummeted to -30F.

The BNP Paribas credit trader  sent her coordinates to rescuers on Sunday afternoon.

However, it took the team almost 24 hours to locate her. 

After a failed attempt on Sunday, a National Guard crew flew over the area with a helicopter on Monday morning but couldn't see anything because of blowing snow and had to turn back.

'Unfortunately, a lot of the coordinates that we received over the night were all over the place within a mile circumference,' Fish and Game Lt. Jim Goss told WMUR-TV.

Mount Madison is part of a series of summits named after presidents and other prominent Americans, which is collectively called the Presidential Range.

 Plans: Authorities say Matrosova planned to climb all four peaks of the Presidential Range on her own

Matrosova, whose full name is Ekaterina, hailed from Omsk, Russia, before moving to Chicago to study in 2002

Matrosova's Facebook showed her to be very active, with numerous images of hikes and white water rafting

According to WMUR-TV, Matrosova was going to venture through Mount Adams, Mount Jefferson and Mount Washington after reaching the top of Mount Madison. 

She found between Mount Madison and Mount Adams.

A team made up of Fish and Game officers, Mountain Rescue Services members and Androscoggin Valley Search and Rescue members braved 108mph winds and frigid temperatures to reach the area.  

'I guess if you are gonna hike in this type of weather you need to be in a more sheltered area, not up on an open exposed ridgeline,' Goss said. 'There's just no room for error in a place like that.'

It is believed Matrosova, whose full name is Ekaterina Matrosova, hailed from Omsk in Russia before moving to Chicago to study in 2002. 

She completed a Bachelor of Science majoring in Finance and Marketing at Chicago's DePaul University in 2006.

Matrosova's first job was with JP Morgan as a financial analyst, before moving to Beach Capital Management where she reached the role of Investment Adviser.

In 2012, she attended Harvard University Extension School to study Numerical Analysis before obtaining a masters in financial engineering from the University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business in 2013.

Tribute: This picture was posted on Facebook in tribute to Matrosova with a friend called her 'a vibrant spirit'

After interning for a year at BNP Paribas, she accepted the role of Credit Trading Associate in August 2014.

Based on Facebook pictures, she appeared to be very active, with numerous images of hikes and white water rafting. Her interests are listed on LinkedIn as mountain climbing, judo and scuba diving.

Friends and relatives paid tribute to Matrosova online, posting pictures of the 32-year-old. 

One wrote: 'Rest in peace...' with a photograph of Matrosova hiking through sunlight snowy woodland.

Another described her as 'a vibrant spirit'.

A blizzard watch was issued for coastal New England over the weekend that touched on the edge of the White Mountain National Forest, which encompasses the Presidential Range.

The region saw up to 14 inches of snow in some areas.
