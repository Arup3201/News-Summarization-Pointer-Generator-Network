Eyes transfixed with excitement, they gathered around a 4x2in screen to witness the moving image of a man who would be king flash 200 miles through the air.

This is the moment that the first TV image was officially received outside London - on a £20 portable device known as a ‘Model A Televisor’ - at 11am on October 8, 1929 in Shipley, West Yorkshire.

The group of men included Harry Barton-Chapple, a technical advisor and publicist for the TV set’s manufacturer Baird, and Sydney Moseley, an associate of the firm - who both travelled from London.

They gathered at the home of Sidney Wright, manager of the radio department at Christopher Pratt & Sons, which was the North’s top furniture store at the time and also offered early wireless systems.

The device they used cost £20 - around £1,000 in today's money, based on inflation using the retail price index - and was first marketed in a Baird brochure in 1928, a year before the famed broadcast.

The images have emerged following research into the broadcast by radio and TV expert Iain Logie Baird, an assistant curator at the National Media Museum in Bradford, who spoke to MailOnline.

Explaining that signals were eventually picked up as far south as Africa and as far north as Iceland, he said: ‘This was the first documented reception of TV outside London as transmitted by the BBC.

‘This was the first time they’d really been able to get it working. It was to show the pictures were clear even that far away (in Shipley). People weren’t sure that TV could be sent as far as radio.

‘TV was of science fiction novels then. They were very pleased to be seeing an identifiable image. It was quite remarkable how many people then started to tune into these small images.’

Following discussions between Baird, 
the BBC, and the Government, it was declared in 1929 that TV broadcasts would begin over the BBC - and Baird would make the 
programmes.

TV signals would
 be sent from the Baird studios in London through phone lines to the 
BBC’s main radio transmitter, 2LO, and TV programming would appear 
outside normal radio broadcasting hours.

'It was difficult to imagine that this vision was being flashed 200 miles through the air. The man disappeared. In its place there came another vision'

Newspaper report from 1929

This would be launched on September 30, 1929 - and a week later the image of the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VIII, would be officially received outside London, in the showing organised by Mr Barton-Chapple.

He taught electrical engineering at Bradford Technical College - now the University of Bradford - from 1922 to 1925 and joined Baird in 1928.

Mr Wright, whose home was used as the location for receiving the broadcast, supplied his own radio receiver set and loudspeaker - which was required for use in addition to the ‘televisor’ device.

A report in the Bradford Telegraph and Argus newspaper on the day of the broadcast described the moment, saying the ‘enthralled’ group of men watched as the individual’s face moved on screen.

It said: ‘The people in the room watched this individual as he turned his head first to one side and then the other, opened his mouth, raised his eyebrows, laughed and scowled.

‘It was difficult to imagine that this vision was being flashed 200 miles through the air. The man disappeared. In its place there came another vision.

'TV was of science fiction novels then. They were very pleased to be seeing an identifiable image'

Iain Logie Baird, radio and TV expert

‘Still a man’s face, which in a moment was easily recognisable as a profile of the Prince of Wales. He was without a hat, and his collar and tie were easily seen.’

Mr Logie Baird, 44, who was born in Canada but now lives in Britain, is the grandson of John Logie Baird, described as the man who 'almost single-handedly invented the TV industry'.

Mr Logie Baird Snr, who was born in Scotland in 1888, made the first transatlantic TV transmission, the first video recordings and gave the first demonstration of colour TV. He died in 1946 aged 57.

Mr Logie Baird Jr added that his family 
tree has brought him ‘a lot of access to the information over the 
years’, adding: ‘I’m the person in this generation that’s taken on the 
role of family historian.’

Mr Barton-Chapple’s son Derek Waring 
would also have his place in TV history - but for a different reason. He
 was an actor, who played Detective Inspector Goss in the police drama 
series Z-Cars.
