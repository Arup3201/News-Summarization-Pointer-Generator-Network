A manhunt was launched in a German town today after a computer game fan dressed up as the lead character from Assassin's Creed and went for a walk in his local park.

Panic spread through the town of Rottweil, southwest Germany, as the mystery 25-year-old gamer roamed the streets in a hooded, white cloak and boots with a sword tucked into his belt.

Parents became so concerned after pictures of the man began circulating on Twitter that many kept their children at home, saying the youngsters couldn't sleep for fear the medieval hitman would creep into their homes in the dead of night and kill them in their beds.

Assassin on the loose: German media reported that parents were keeping their kids at home in the Rottweil while police appealed for anyone who can identify the hooded assassin character after numerous sightings were made across the city, and uploaded on social media

As rumour and speculation spread among 
the 25,000 population city, one local paper even made a public appeal to
 the assassin to turn himself in.

It said: 'Many parents 
have reported that the children can't sleep at night, and believe they 
might end up as the next victim of the assassin. 'Please turn yourself 
in and put the panic to rest.'

Under one of the photos a social media user had written: 'I may not kill all of you, but I will kill as many as I can.'

However it was after the
 police set up an operations room and issued a number to call to track 
down the mystery assassin, he turned himself in and apologised for the 
fuss he had caused.

The 
unnamed man, described as a 25-year-old local, said: 'I am a huge fan of
 the game, and I just really like the costume and wanted to wear it.

'I didn't have any idea it would upset people and cause such a fuss.'

As
 a sign of good faith, he handed over the costume to police to convince 
them that he did not intend to wear it again and the police issued a 
press release with images of the costume to the media to stop the panic.
