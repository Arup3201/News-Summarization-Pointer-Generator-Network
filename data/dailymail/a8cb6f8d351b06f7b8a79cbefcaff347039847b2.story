Doting father Ben Jones brought cheer to his poorly daughter after she lost her hair to chemotherapy by getting her to shave his head too - so they could look like 'twins.'

Mechanic Ben, 27, feared eight year old Morgan Hewitt would to be self conscious of her appearance after she diagnosed with a rare former of leukaemia which only affects 650 people a year.

So after brave Morgan volunteered to have her own hair shaved off during intense chemotherapy Ben and Morgan’s mother Catherine Hewitt offered to have their heads shaved too out of solidarity to their daughter.

The youngster said no to her mother's offer but agreed to shave her father’s head at the hospital - whilst 28-year old Catherine filmed the episode for the family album.

Catherine, from Colne, Lancashire, said: 'When I said I wanted to shave my head with her she told me that I would embarrass her if her mummy had a bald head, but she’d let Ben have his shaved.

'She’s the little boss and when we gave her the clippers she said ‘I’ll do it’. She was really proud of daddy when he’d had his done.

'She’d already had her hair all shaved and said to Ben, ‘come on dad it’s your turn, you are having yours off now’.

'Then she got him on the floor and turned on the clippers. It was so funny watching her because his hair was quite long and she was ragging his hair out and looked like she was having so much fun.

'We all had a really good giggle and it was the first time we’d seen her properly giggle in weeks, it had certainly been a very long time. She was amazing I still can’t find the words to describe her but she fought every step of the way.

'She just got on with it and I knew she wasn’t giving up. You see so many children in the ward really down and she was a little trooper.'

Morgan was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia last June and was later admitted to a children’s ward at Leeds General Infirmary where she remained for 24 days and underwent six weeks of chemotherapy.

Catherine added: 'Her hair started thinning and started coming out days into the chemotherapy and it was driving her nuts and she said she wanted it all off. She said, ‘I will be like all the other children in the ward and I will not look any different.

'It broke my heart, I was a mess and couldn’t stop crying.

'She asked the nurses to bring in some shavers, she just announced ‘can you fetch the shavers in so we can shave my hair’. She even told us not to be upset because her hair would soon grow back.

'The nurse brought the shavers in and then took me out of the room and said, ‘I just want to tell you that in all my career and years working I have never had a child who is so positive about everything and wants her own hair shaving off’. She even took her own bloods and insulin.

'Morgan told me to put her hair in a bobble and cut it. Hesitating I did and she still looked beautiful. She was the strong one not me and is the most amazing person I have met.'

After just eight days of intense chemotherapy, doctors saw that the cancer had been reduced from 60 per cent to 25 per cent. She is now in remission and is awaiting the arrival of a wig.

Cat added: 'She just got on with it and I knew she wasn’t giving up. You see so many children in the ward really down and she was a little trooper.

'She had six weeks of intense chemotherapy and at day 28 she went into remission.

'She was going to have the hair made into a wig but she has been too poorly to travel to London to get if fitted and has still got the hair in a box which she decorated herself.

'It will take a few months for her to get back to normal and until we will start seeing the normal Morgan but we are all so proud of her progress.'

Mechanic Ben, 27, said: 'Morgan’s the brave one. She’s handled it so well. She is amazing and so inspiring and she still looks gorgeous. She’s coping so well, she’s a tough little cookie.'
