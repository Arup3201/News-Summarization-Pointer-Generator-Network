Wanted: Police want to locate Danny Spencer after his ex-wife Jane was found dead in her home

Police are hunting the former husband of a Cheltenham woman after she was found murdered in her own home.

Jane Wiggett, nee Spencer, was found dead in her flat in Whaddon, Cheltenham, on Friday.

Her body was discovered after officers were called to her home and Gloustershire Police have launched a murder inquiry.

Police are hunting her ex-husband Danny Spencer, who they wish to arrest in connection with Ms Wiggett's death.

Mr Spencer, 57, is well known in the area, according to police, and is a regular drinker in the pubs in Cheltenham town centre and Whaddon.

Today Gloucestershire Police released images of Mr Spencer in the hope that the public will be able to help them track him down.

They fear Mr Spencer may be looking to leave the country following the death of Ms Wiggett.

Officers said that although Mr Spencer was not considered a threat to the public they should not approach him.

A force spokesman said: ‘Danny Spencer is described as white, of stocky build and in his late 50s.

‘He appears to be bald or have close cropped grey hair.

'He is not considered to pose a threat to the public, but the public should not approach him.

‘Police are keen to trace anyone who knew Jane, or who have seen her in the last month.’

Anyone who knows of Mr Spencer's current whereabouts is asked to contact Gloucestershire Police on 101 quoting incident 457 of August 15.

Alternatively call 0800 0560154, 0207 1580011 or 999.

Police alert: Danny Spencer, a frequent visitor to Cheltenham's pubs, is not a danger to the public, but Gloucestershire Police warn not to approach him
