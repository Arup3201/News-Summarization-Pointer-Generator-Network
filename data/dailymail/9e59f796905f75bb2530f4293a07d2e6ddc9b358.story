Passengers and crew on a flight to Sydney saved the life of a yachtsman lost at sea by finding him with a pair of binoculars.

Australian Glenn Ey, 44, was stranded 270 miles off the coast when the Air Canada plane diverted from its route and swooped low in the sky to find him.

The Boeing 777, one of the only aircraft close to the remote spot, then radioed the authorities and he was brought safely back to shore in Sydney.

Crew found the storm-damaged boat by peering out of the windows using binoculars borrowed from a 
passenger, while the pilot dropped down to around 5,000 feet (1,200 metres).

Terrifying ordeal: The Boeing 777 was radioed for help because it was one of the few aircraft anywhere near the lost yachtsman

Distress: Glenn Ey's boat had got into trouble and was drifting in rough seas off Australia's east coast

Narrow escape: Passengers and crew managed to spot the 44-year-old in his 11m yacht 'Streaker', and he was rescued. Pictured, the yachtsman on police vessel Nemesis on his way back to shore

They managed to pinpoint where the solo yachtsman was drifting on his 36ft (11m) boat Streaker and he was rescued.

Mr Ey had got into trouble after leaving Pittwater, on Sydney's northern beaches, two weeks ago.

He had been heading for Eden on the New South Wales south coast, but after rough weather knocked down his mast, he was left helpless, 270 nautical miles east of Wollongong.

He activated an emergency beacon early on Tuesday reporting that his boat had hit rough seas iand drifted out into the ocean.

The lucky 44-year-old was located by the plane, which was heading
from Vancouver to Sydney, and the Australian Maritime Safety Authorities brought him back to Sydney harbour on police boat Nemesis - where his relieved mother was waiting to give him a hug.

Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said the airline commends the crew and passengers aboard flight AC033 for spotting the boat and advising authorities of its location.

Relief: Mr Ey hugs his mother after his frightening experience on the two-week trip south from northern Pittwater

Stranded: Mr Ey was found 270 miles off the coast of Wollongong as he headed down towards the south coast of New South Wales

Heroic group: The pilot on the flight from Vancouver to Sydney informed passengers of the situation and then swooped down to 5,000ft while they scanned the choppy seas

'The pilots immediately determined they had sufficient fuel to undertake this, and headed out to the remote area which was over fairly rough seas,' he said.

'After apprising the customers onboard that we would assist as we were the only aircraft in the immediate vicinity, all onboard became involved in the search efforts.

'The crew borrowed binoculars from customers and also engaged those sitting on the right-hand side of the aircraft to help look.Â 

'As our aircraft flew over the area at 4,000 feet, a reflection from a mirror shining upwards was spotted and the crew saw the yacht in question, de-masted with a person standing - which was confirmed by a number of passengers.'
