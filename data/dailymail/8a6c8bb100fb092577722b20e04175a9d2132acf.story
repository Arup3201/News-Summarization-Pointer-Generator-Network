UKIP's success in the May European elections has coincided with a surge in donations to the party

Donations to Ukip have exceeded those to the Liberal Democrats for the first time.

Ukip was given more than £1.4million in the three months to June – a three-fold increase on the previous period - compared to the Lib Dems’ total of £1.2million.

Most of the Ukip total was accounted for by a single donation from Yorkshire entrepreneur Paul Sykes, who gave the party just over £1million.

The donation figures may be seen as reflecting the parties’ respective political fortunes over recent months.

While Ukip romped to victory in the European Parliament elections, the Lib Dems saw their number of MEPs slashed to just one.

Ukip said the figures were testament to the fact that Ukip was ‘replacing the Lib Dems as the third party of British politics’.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘We have got a long way to go in terms of our fundraising but we are getting there.

‘To overhaul the Lib Dems for the first time is another symptom of a very real change that is taking place in British politics.’

Overall the figures showed the Tories outperforming Labour in fundraising in the run up to next year’s General Election.

The Conservative Party reported raising £7,185,709 in donations, nearly half of all the money raised by all political parties over the three month period.

Among the biggest Tory donors were Barrie Pettman, a publisher Michael Gooley, a former SAS officer who set up travel company Trailfinders. Both donated £500,000.

The Tory total was nearly double the £3.7million raised by Labour in the same period. Of that one union, Unison, accounted for nearly a fifth with a single donation of more than £680,000. Property developer Sir David Garrard gave the party £629,000.

Tory analysis of the figures suggested Labour had received some £34million from the unions under Ed Miliband – the equivalent of £741,000 a month.

Around one third of the £34million came the Unite union, led by ‘Red’ Len McCluskey. Union donations in that period account for 70 per cent of all Labour’s funding.

Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘The figures are jaw dropping. Apparently it costs £1,000 an hour to hire your own very Labour leader.

‘Union bosses like Len McCluskey have siphoned off £34 million from their members' pay-packets, and funnelled it into Labour’s election war chest - a truly staggering amount.

‘And we all know what payback they want from weak Ed Miliband: more wasteful spending, more taxes, and more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.’

Nick Clegg's Lib Dems earned less in donations in the three months to June than UKIP, for the first time ever

Labour said the Tories were being ‘bankrolled by a small pool of big money donors’. A spokesman said another £2 million had been raised by the

Tories from donors who attended private dinners with David Cameron and other senior ministers - taking the total to £5 million this year.

Donations from individuals or companies linked to hedge funds or other asset management companies totalled some £1.6million in the second quarter of this year.

Shadow cabinet office minister Jonathan Ashworth MP said: ‘When millions are flowing in from hedge funds and exclusive groups of donors, is it

any wonder David Cameron stands up for the privileged few?

‘Millionaires and hedge funds have been given a tax cut while hardworking families suffer from a cost-of-living crisis. David Cameron is leading an out-of-touch, hollowed-out party which has no answers to the major challenges our country faces.’

Mr Sykes was a Tory donor who quit the party in 1994 over John Major’s approach to Europe – before offering to fund rebel Eurosceptic Tories in the 1997 election.

He then shifted to Ukip before returning to the Tories for the 2005 election. His fortune is estimated at some £650million. The donations came from his company, the Highstone Group Ltd.

The figures were released by the Electoral Commission, which collates donation details.

The Scottish National Party raised £1.1 million – the vast bulk in a single donation from Stagecoach boss Brian Souter.
