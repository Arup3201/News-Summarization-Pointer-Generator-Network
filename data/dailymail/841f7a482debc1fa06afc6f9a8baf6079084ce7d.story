The first pictures of Amazon's much rumoured 3D handset have been revealed - and show off the four cameras used to create a 'floating screen' effect.

Set to be unveiled in June, the device will use retina-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to 'float above the screen like a hologram and appear three-dimensional at all angles.'

The latest images also reveal a relatively thin handset - although covered in a case to shield its true design.

Set to be unveiled in June, the device will use retina-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to 'float above the screen like a hologram and appear three-dimensional at all angles.'

The device has a front facing camera in each corner of the screen.

These extra cameras are used to track the position of the user’s face and eyes in relation to the phone’s display.

This allows Amazon’s software to make constant adjustments to the positioning of on-screen elements, altering the perspective of visuals on the screen and making them appear to be in 3D - without the need for glasses.

'Finally, we have obtained exclusive photos of a prototype of the unreleased device, giving the world its first look at Amazon’s hotly anticipated phone, web site BGR said.

'As can be seen in the images, the device is covered by a protective shell intended to prevent people without authorization from seeing the physical design of the phone.'

The handset will be revealed in June and launched in September, the report claims.

It is expected to have a 4.7inch screen.

This would pit it directly against Apple's upcoming iPhone 6, which is also expected to go on sale in September.

KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also believes the firm will launch a phone.

'We predict Amazon (US) will launch its own brand smartphone in 3-6 months, using the same hardware strategy as used for its e-reader and tablet,' he recently wrote.

'The supply chain will start stocking up materials in Q2 2014 for production.'

It comes just weeks after the firm launched Fire TV, a set top box that doubles as a games console.

The box allows users to download films and TV shows, along with apps.To play games, users can use a remote, or buy a separate game controller for $40.

The handset is shown in a special protective case to shield its final design. However, the four cameras are clearly visible in each corner

The handset look almost like Nokia's Windows Phone with its large, rounded shell - although that is believed to be simply to hide the final design

Mike Frazzini from Amazon Games said each game will be priced like a phone app, costing on average $2.

Games available at launch will include Minecraft, driving game Asphalt 8 and first person shooter Sev Zero, created by the games studio double Helix Microsoft bought recently.

Peter Larsen from Amazon said the firm wanted to 'invent and simplify' with the box.

'It's incredibly powerful, and it's unbelievably simple,' he said.

The move would pit Amazon in a battle with Google and Apple, which is expected to unveil its latest iPhone in September

'Tiny box, huge specs, tons of content, incredible price—people are going to love Fire TV,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Founder and CEO.

The service uses Amazon's existing Prime TV and film on demand service, along with Hulu Plus.

The gadget, costing $99, is aimed squarely at Amazon and Roku's products along with google's Chromecast.

Following Amazon's foray into the tablet market with the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD - being shown off here by CEO Jeff Bezo - the company is said to now be working on a smartphone with a 3D screen

The firm said it plans to add more services in the future.

Amazon already offers on-demand TV shows and movies free to customers who are members of Amazon's premium shipping service Prime, in both the UK and US.

Speculation about Amazon smartphones began in 2011.
