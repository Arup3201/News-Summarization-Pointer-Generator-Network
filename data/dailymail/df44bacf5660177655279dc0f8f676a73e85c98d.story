When Kim Jong Un wants to reward his faithful minions he puts on a magnificent spread replete with all the trimmings.

There were dips, deep-fried vegetables and even some boiled eggs on offer as the North Korean despot thanked officers for fulfilling his father's dying dream: to plant a lot of trees.

He made the bountiful gesture following an inspection of the Ryo Islet Defense Detachment - a vast military base responsible for protecting the island of Ryodo and the coastal city of Wonsan.

Wonson is an area of particular strategic importance to Kim because on its outskirts lies his favourite luxury holiday home.

'[The outpost] is an important combat mission of the detachment to definitely turn the islet into an impregnable fortress and unsinkable battleship and thus not to allow enemies to invade the socialist homeland,' state-run news agancy KCNA said.

The young leader and his father, the late leader Kim Jong-il, have frequently visited the vacation home and last year ordered the creation of the nation's first beach resort in the city.

Kim praised the military detachment for successfully doing 'everything the Party Central Committee considered as good,' while also saying that it is 'a model unit where the party's military policy is being most correctly implemented and a typical one for the whole army to learn from,' according to the report.

It was a marked change from the thunderous mood he was seen in last when he publicly scolded the national weather service for giving incorrect forecasts and using out-of-date equipment.

In a rare public dressing down of a government body, Kim urged the Hydro-meteorological Service to update its equipment and improve its work.

'There are many incorrect forecasts as the meteorological observation has not been put on a modern and scientific basis,' Kim said, telling the agency to 'fundamentally' improve its work and equipment.

Public criticism is rare in North Korea, with Kim usually keen to praise government agencies in an attempt to pass his regime off as a success

Accurate forecasts are needed to protect the 'lives and properties' of people from disasters caused by 'abnormal climatic phenomenon', he said.

Calling the weather service 'very important work directly affecting the overall economic affairs', Kim also underscored the need to 'modernise meteorological observation equipment at a high level', KCNA said.

It was not clear when Kim visited the agency, but public criticism of government officials during field trips by North Korean leaders is extremely rare.

Usually Kim's official visits are marked by broad smiles and adoring crowds while Kim praises the work people are doing, in an attempt to pass his regime off as a success.
