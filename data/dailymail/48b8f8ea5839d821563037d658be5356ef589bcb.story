German authorities have today arrested a 93-year-old alleged former Auschwitz guard on suspicion of accessory to murder.

Hans Lipschis, who once lived in the United States, was taken into custody today after prosecutors concluded there was 'compelling evidence' he was involved in crimes at Auschwitz while there from 1941 to 1945. 

Lipschis admits he served with the Nazi SS in the notorious death camp but claims he was only a cook. About 1.5 million people, primarily Jews, were killed at the camp.

Hans Lipschis was taken into custody Monday after prosecutors concluded there was 'compelling evidence' he was involved in crimes at Auschwitz while there from 1941 to 1945

Lipschis
was deported from the U.S. in 1983 for lying about his Nazi past when 
he immigrated to Chicago in the 1950s after the war. 

Stuttgart prosecutors say a doctor confirmed his health remains good enough for him to be kept in detention.

He is expected to be the first person brought to court after investigations were launched by German officials several weeks ago into the Auschwitz guards who escaped scot free after WW2.

Lipschis, who was born in Lithuania in 1919 and was granted 'ethnic German' status in 1943, is accused of working at Auschwitz-Birkenau as a member of the S.S. from 1941 to 1945.

He is suspected of participating in murder and genocide.

Lipschis’ name was added a few weeks ago to a list of wanted Nazi criminals published by Dr Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's office in Israel.

Over 1.2 million people, mostly Jews, were murdered at Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland during the war.

A German newspaper tracked Lipschis down to a retirement home near Stuttgart where he denied the charges.

He claimed he knew nothing about the horrors committed at the camp and said he was a 'cook for the entire time I was there.'

In the past German prosecutors have relied on eyewitness testimony or paperwork when bringing murder charges against suspected war criminals.

But the conviction of Sobibor death camp guard John Demjanjuk in 2011 in Munich set a new precedent whereby it was enough for people to have served at a site of mass extermination without specific acts being proved.

In 1956 Lipschis fled to the United States and lived in Chicago for 26 years, but was deported to Germany in 1983 after being identified by the U.S. as a Nazi war criminal.
