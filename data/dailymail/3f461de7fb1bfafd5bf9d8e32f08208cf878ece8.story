Belief in God - or other higher powers - might be linked to a person's ability to imagine what others think and feel.

The discovery could mean that people who find it difficult to 'mentalise' - think 'inside' other people's heads, are unable to believe.

'Mentalising' is the capacity to 
understand what another person is thinking - a crucial aspect in how 
people handle the social world.

Religious believers usually think of their deities as beings who 'think' in a way similar to human beings.

People with autistic spectrum disorders have difficulty mentalising.

'Autistic adolescents expressed less belief in God,' say the researchers.

The study was based on samples of Canadian studies, and two nationwide samples of the American population.

Men also have far more trouble with the social skill.

‘Religious believers intuitively think of their deities as personified 
beings with mental states who anticipate and respond to human needs and 
actions.

'Therefore, mentalizing deficits would be expected to make 
religious belief less intuitive,' say the researchers, from the University of British Columbia.

Other factors, such as cultural and psychological factors are also at work - it's not as simple as 'mentalising' being the key to whether someone is a believer or not.

According to Will Gervais, who co-led the investigation, ‘Mentalizing deficits are known to be more common in men than women, and in our research this explained the well-known finding that men tend to be less religious than women’.
