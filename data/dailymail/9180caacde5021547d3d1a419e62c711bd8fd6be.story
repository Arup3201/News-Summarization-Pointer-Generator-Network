Accused murderer Gable Tostee has left a Brisbane prison on bail three months after he was arrested for the alleged murder of Warriena Wright in Surfers Paradise.

Gable Tostee has arrived at the family home at Carrara, west of Surfers Paradise, where he will spend at least the next 14 months on bail awaiting trial. 

Wearing a white t-shirt, black shorts and thongs was, a clean-shaven Tostee, 28, was seen leaving prison on Wednesday afternoon after he was granted bail. 

He followed his mother, Helene, to the car park of the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre at Wacol in far western Brisbane at 5.25pm local time. 

Tostee was carrying belongings in a large cardboard box marked ' fresh farm eggs'.

Mrs Tostee shielded her face from waiting media.

His father, Burleigh Heads carpet salesman Gray Tostee, waited for two hours in the prison car park during a giant thunderstorm to collect his son as correctional authorities signed off on Gable's bail papers.

Helene and Gray Tostee, who attended both days of their son's bail hearing in the Brisbane Supreme Court on Tuesday and Wednesday, picked up some items from a store while waiting for the paperwork to be finalised for Gable's release.

 The couple will drive their son to the family's Carrara house, where he will live under strict bail conditions and under a nightly curfew before his trial for alleged murder, not expected to begin until 2016. 

Mr and Mrs Tostee, who  were in the Brisbane Supreme Court  for the decision earlier today, have put up a $200,000 surety to reduce the flight risk of their 28-year-old son.

Tostee will also be subject to random breath tests to ensure he adheres to the bail condition that he not drink alcohol. 

Granting Tostee bail, Justice Debra Mullins said the strict conditions imposed on him would reduce the risk of him fleeing.

They included an alcohol ban, treatment for alcohol abuse, random breath testing and abstinence from not only Tinder, but all social media to try to meet up with women. 

‘I am satisfied the applicant has shown cause as to why his detention in custody is not justified,’ Justice Mullins said.

Crown prosecutor Ben Power argued there was a strong risk Tostee would flee with the threat of a mandatory 20-year prison sentence looming.

But defence barrister Soraya Ryan argued Tostee's public profile meant he couldn't hide from authorities. 

Tostee has been in custody at the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre since he was arrested in mid-Augustand charged with murdering New Zealand woman, Warriena Wright, who fell to her death from his 14th floor apartment on August 8.

The Avalon apartments (above) in Surfers Paradise on Queensland's Gold Coast were the scene of the fatal fall by Warriena Wright 14 storeys to the ground at around 2.20am on August 8 this year

At a bail hearing on Tuesday, prosecutors told the court that locking 26-year-old victim Warriena Wright outside on a 14th floor balcony was akin to locking someone in a trunk to suffocate.

Justice  Mullins told the court the case 'is not in any view a straightforward case of murder'.

Mr Tostee was arrested a week later after Ms Wright's death. Following the first, adjourned part of his bail hearing, Tostee replaced his original legal team with renowned Queensland civil liberties lawyer, Terry O'Gorman. 

Tostee's lawyers, from Brisbane firm Robertson O'Gorman said that while he was in prison, he was 'always on guard' against fellow inmates.

Ms Wright died at around 2.20am, just hours after meeting Mr Tostee at Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise via the mobile dating app Tinder.

Mr Tostee denies he murdered Ms Wright. Mr Tostee appointed Mr O'Gorman following the civil libertarian's comments about the release of court documents including an alleged transcript of Ms Wright's night with him, taped on his phone, and a damning police affidavit of what occurred between the two in the hours before Ms Wright's death. 

The prosecution claims Tostee has a ‘bizarre indifference to Ms Wright's death’ and that she had been affected on the night of her death by alcohol in the form of a ‘white spirit’ made by him.

Justice Mullins has made mention during the hearing of the accused’s autism and social anxiety.

Mr O'Gorman described as 'absolutely worrying' police claims in the affidavit filed in the Brisbane Supreme Court, which included that Mr Tostee and Ms Wright allegedly had a fight before she fell.

The police affidavit was among eleven documents filed for Gable Tostee's first bail application, before  Justice Debra Mullins, who adjourned the matter to give Mr Tostee's defence team more time.

Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden told that hearing Mr Tostee was unlikely to have been on the balcony when Ms Wright plunged 14 storeys to her death.

Justice Mullins described the Crown prosecutor's case for murder as 'weak' and 'difficult', but said a case of manslaughter would be 'strong'.

Justice Mullins said a diagnosis of autism for Gable Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his Surfers Paradise apartment on the night Ms Wright died.

'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' she told Mr Tostee's defence, 'but in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.'
