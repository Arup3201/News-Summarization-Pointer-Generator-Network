Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp and Martin Keown give their expert match analysis following England's World Cup defeat to Uruguay.

MARTIN SAYS...

Luis Suarez's first goal was similar to the one England conceded to Mario Balotelli on Saturday. Once again, the centre forward pulled off the shoulder of our defender and punished us.

Phil Jagielka should have been touch-tight in the box. Instead, he was a few yards off Suarez, who drifted away.

Suarez is always looking to pull off the shoulder and Jagielka just stood still.

In that situation you have to turn your body so you can see the man and the ball.

Suarez
 moves like Ian Rush. Even when I played a charity match against Rush 18
 months ago, he was only interested in the space behind me.

We can look at the defending, but the pass by Edinson Cavani is brilliant and it takes out five players.

Suarez’s world-class movement beats Phil Jagielka - takes his tally to six goals in six games against the Everton man. Gary Cahill and Jagielka were terrorised by the Liverpool striker.

Roy Hodgson said Suarez had to score at this World Cup to prove he is world-class. Suarez proved his point, twice.

The first half was not exactly packed with clear chances - Luis Suarez’s goal was the first shot on target.

JAMIE SAYS...

I can understand why England picked Jordan Henderson.

He had a good season for Liverpool, but he plays in a different position, higher up the pitch, for his club.

He is deeper for England and the team were crying out for more dare and creativity.

I wanted Jack Wilshere or Ross Barkley on from half-time but Barkley did not arrive until the 64th minute. He had an impact when he came on.

MARTIN SAYS...

Leighton Baines and Glen Johnson are huge attacking threats for their clubs. But they are frustrating for England.

They were both so conservative in possession in the first half.

Things improved after the break but playing at the highest level has a lot to do with self-esteem.

Wayne Rooney is level with Michael Owen on 40 England goals.

JAMIE SAYS...

It's not rocket science. If you play your best players in their best positions they will do the business for you.

There’s been debate all week but playing through the middle Wayne Rooney hit the bar and was clearly our most influential player.

England had a poor night but Rooney answered some of his critics.
