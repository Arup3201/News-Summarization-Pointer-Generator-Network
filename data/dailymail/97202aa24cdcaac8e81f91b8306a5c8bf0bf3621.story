This is the spectacular result of China's coldest winter in decades.

Fast-flowing water would normally be raging down the rocky cliffs of the 200ft fall in Anjiazhuang Valley, a suburb of Beijing.

But with temperatures plummeting to their lowest in 28 years - it has frozen over - giving these climbing tourists a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to scale its heights.

One off: The 200ft drop is normally a fast-flowing waterfall but it has frozen over in an unusually cold winter

Parts of northeastern China have seen temperatures of -40 degrees this year.

The extreme weather has seen an estimated 180,000 cattle killed, airports closed and electricity supplies cut off.

Ice climbing is a popular sport around the world but can be much more dangerous than rock climbing - especially if the ice is melting.

On Boxing Day 2010 a man died trying to climb up Cautley Spout, in Sedbergh, Cumbria.

Dave Church, a driving instructor and keen triathlete from Durham, fell to his death from 75ft.
