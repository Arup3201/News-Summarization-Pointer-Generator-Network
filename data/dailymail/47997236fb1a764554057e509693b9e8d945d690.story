Chelsea have made a move for Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Douglas Costa as they continue to broker a £20million plus deal for Fiorentina winger Juan Cuadrado. 

The move comes as Fiorentina dig in their heels over their valuation of Cuadrado.

Costa is a Brazilian who has been on Chelsea's radar since he was a teenager and formed an exciting midfield partnership alongside current Stamford Bridge star Willian while at Shakhtar.

The 24-year-old has been capped by Brazil but has dual-Portuguese nationality and is eager to leave Ukraine and move to London.

Shakhtar are notoriously difficult to negotiate with though and agreeing a fee will not be straightforward.

Chelsea want quality replacements with Andre Schurrle and Mohamed Salah both looking to leave.

Fiorentina want £26.8m for Cuadrado, his release clause, and Chelsea have offered £20.6m and are willing to add the rest in bonuses. His agent Alessandro Lucci is due to hold further talks on Thursday.

Costa began his career at Gremio where he caught the attention of European scouts, with Chelsea and Manchester United both making bids to sign him when he was 18. He opted to stay in Brazil for a season before joining Shakhtar in a surprise £6m transfer.

However, he has continued to develop and is regarded as one of the best attacking midfielders in Europe. The thought of having two D Costas at Stamford Bridge will certainly whet the fans' appetite.
