New York City police are investigating the treatment of a heavily pregnant woman who was shoved belly-first to the ground in a heavy-handed arrest that has left her fearing for her baby's health.

Video footage shows an officer struggling with Sandra Amezquita, who police say tried to intervene in the arrest of her 17-year-old son in the early hours of Saturday morning in Brooklyn.

She is handcuffed behind her back and then taken to the ground, leaving her with a mark on her stomach.

At a press conference yesterday, Amezquita said: 'I'm afraid of what is going to happen to my baby. I pray to God nothing happens to him.'

Her attorney, Sanford Rubenstein, said he wants the DA to look into whether she was hit with an object.

Rubenstein said doctors told Amezquita 'there's no way to tell' if the foetus was harmed. 

He said the family plans to meet on Monday with prosecutors. The Brooklyn district attorney's office said it could not immediately confirm that. 

Amezquita was asking police to 'stop using excessive force' on her teenage son when the altercation happened around 2.15am, her lawyer said.

A man can be heard on the video yelling: 'Oh my God, she's pregnant.'

'It's clear to me when an incident like this occurs you understand why police community relations are at an all-time low,' the attorney said earlier Wednesday.

Internal affairs investigators are looking into the matter, said chief police spokesman Steve Davis.

Rubenstein said another woman who walked over to see what was happening also was thrown to the ground by police. Amezquita's husband was also hurt.

Police identified the teenager as Jhohan Lemos.

He was charged with weapon possession, resisting arrest and harassment. 

Police said he was carrying an illegal knife and has been arrested five times, including for gang assault and robbery.

Amezquita received a summons for disorderly conduct. Two other men were charged with assault, resisting arrest and other charges.

A neighbour, Mercedes Hidalgo, said at the press conference that she was pushed when she tried to tell officers that Amezquita was pregnant.

Last week, another officer from the same precinct was suspended after a video appeared to show him kicking a street fair vendor and walking away.
