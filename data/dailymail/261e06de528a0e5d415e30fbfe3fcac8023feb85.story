Congresswoman Gwen Moore is bringing 400 yellow pencils – unsharpened 0 to Tuesday night's State of the Union address, hoping to spark a bipartisan show of support for free speech in the wake of the the January 7 Islamist massacre of journalists in Paris.

The shooting attack by jihadis – angered by cartoon depictions of the Muslim prophet Muhammad – killed 11 and left 11 more injured. 

Moore 's spokesman said Tuesday that Congress has an opportunity to condemn it with one voice and defend the concept of free speech.

The Wisconsin Democrat 'will hold up a yellow pencil' at selected points during Presdient Barack Obama's annual speech 'to honor those who lost their lives in the pursuit of open ideas and free expression,' Eric Harris told DailyMail.com.

And she wants everyone gathered in the House chamber to join her.

YELLOW PENCIL: The writing implement has become a symbol of free expression across Europe, and Moore will bring 400 of them to the House cahmber on Tuesday

'I hope it's hundreds. We've invited all our Republican colleagues,' Harris added in a phone interview.

'The congresswoman will have pencils with her on the floor. We're bringing 400.'

There are 534 members of Congress, including the 100 senators who will shoehorn themselves into the crowded hall. (One House seat remains vacant after former New York Rep. Michael Grimm's resignation.)

Members of the Supreme Court and most of the president's Cabinet secretaries will also attend, along with Vice President Joe Biden, first lady Michelle Obama and selected guests.

The Moore aide said at 4:00 that nearly three dozen members of Congress had confirmed they would be participating.

Harris explained that French citizens have turned ordinary pencils into protest implements in the weeks since the writers of the Charlie Hebdo satire magazine lost their lives. Holding a pencil above ones head is now an internationally recognized disapproval of censorship.

From Paris to Barcelona to London, pencils lifted skyward have carried a message of support for what Charlie Hebdo stands for – an irreverent and unapologetic mocking tone toward anyone and anything of importance.

'We'd like to do it every time the president refers to the victims, and every time he refers to freedom of speech or expression,' he said.

Obama is expected to mention the Paris attacks at least once Tuesday night.

Separately, the House of Representatives passed a resolution on Tuesday officially condemning the Charlie Hebdo attack and a separate deadly act of terror at a Paris kosher supermarket.

'Seventeen innocents lost their lives, and this resolution carries our condolences to their loved ones,' House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. 

'With this condemnation also comes a commitment to stand with France and our allies in confronting the grave threat radical Islam poses to our security and way of life,' he said.

WHERE WAS POTUS? A January 11 rally of millions in Paris went off without President Barack Obama, who was reportedly watching football; he will likely try to express his solidarity in his State of the Union address

ERASERS: Muslims in Pakistan and elsewhere have rallied to condemn the Paris magazine for showing cartoons oMuhammad

EUROPEAN UNION: As far away as the UK and Turkey – this woman demonstrated in Ankara – people have held pencils aloft to signify the defense of free expression in the face of religious extremism

Moore's spokesman was more circumspect about seeing her pencil protest as a statement about religion.

'The gesture is not meant to insult Muslims nor is it an attack on Islam,' Harris insisted in a followup email.

He framed his boss's concerns in the same language Obama uses – condemning 'the threat of violent extremism' – without touching the liberal third-rail of casting suspicion on Islam itself.

The idea for a pencil protest began as a Democrats-only stunt, passed in secret from press secretary to press secretary.

Then an email from Harris to his colleagues was leaked to National Journal. Suddenly it was a bipartisan idea, open to both sides of the aisle.

'This is something we just planned to do privately, and then it would just be a surprise during the State of the Union,' Harris told DailyMail.com.

'But because my email was leaked – that's just how it goes.'

'I should have just put "confidential" on top of it,' he joked, 'and made sure it leaked in about ten seconds.'
