His quips have helped make him one of Britain’s best-loved politicians but Boris Johnson last night confessed he sometimes has to ‘dare to be dull’.

The man who once famously stated, ‘my policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it’ said he occasionally has to disappoint those awaiting his next gag.

Mr Johnson, tipped as a future Tory leader, said some topics were too serious to merit witticisms.

Serious: despite being seen as a sometimes comic figure Boris says some subjects are too serious for jokes

‘Sometimes you have to have the wit to be dull. Dare to be dull. Dull it down,’ Mr Johnson, 49, insisted on the BBC Radio 4 documentary How To Be And How Not To Be A Politician.

The London Mayor – whose wit and wisdom is seen by some as the secret of his success – said: ‘I can see people hungering for the perk of the joke, waiting like midwives or staff in an operating room for me to produce this thing.

'And I say something completely reasonable. And they want the gag and the gag doesn’t come.

‘Because there isn’t a gag sometimes and you have to live with that.’

What's so funny? Those who remember the moment Boris got stuck on a zipline during the Olympics may struggle to think of him as dull

Boris earned his reputation as something of a comedian after several bumbling appearances on satirical TV news quiz Have I Got News For You.

While hosting the show his rambling questions and complete confusion over the scoreline drew huge laughs and made the then Tory MP a household name.

In fact the appearance was so shambolic it stretched the usual half hour programme out into two hours which was released as an extended special on DVD.

Boris was elected as MP for Henley in 2001 after a career as a journalist and assistant editor for the Telegraph newspaper but was forced to resign in 2004 over claims he lied about an affair.

He won the post of Mayor of London from Ken Livingstone in the 2008 Mayoral elections and went on to win a second term in May 2012.
