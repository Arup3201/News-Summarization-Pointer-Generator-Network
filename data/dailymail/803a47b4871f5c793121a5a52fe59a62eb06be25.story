Stephen Campbell, picutred in Thailand where he sadly passed away after a jet ski accident

The family of a British man who died in a jet ski accident in Thailand are having to raise £30,000 to bring his body home.

Stephen Campbell, 38, from Blackpool, Lancashire, died in the tragic accident off Larn Island, in the east coast resort of Pattaya, on Wednesday.

Unfortunately, Mr Cambell's insurance will not cover the costs of bringing him home - and now his family are desperately trying to raise the money.

A Facebook page set up by the barber's family read: 'Unfortunately the insurance does not cover him and the process of repatriation is proving to be expensive and in excess of 30k.

'We desperately want to lay him to rest and bring him home to Blackpool....

'So...we are asking for a little bit of help to bring him home'

Mr Campbell, who owned a barber shop, was on a three week holiday when the accident happened. He was due to return home in a week.

The man's neighbours spoke of their shock at his death today.

Tracey Strangwick, 48, who owns a neighbouring business, said: 'It's a real tragedy. I was absolutely devastated when I heard the news.

'Stephen is a lovely person and he will be really missed by everyone round here.He's so friendly and would pop his head in when he walked by and would stop for a natter.

'He was a familiar face to everyone and it's awful to hear he'll no longer be around.

'He adored Thailand and used to go all the time. I think he used to travel around the country.

A tribute to Mr Campbell. His family are now having to raise £30,000 in order to bring the barber's body home

'He really wasn't a thrill-seeker or anything like that. Stephen was a wonderful, warm-hearted man and it's a real shock to everyone that he's died so suddenly in such tragic circumstances.'

Neighbour Russell Ward said Mr Campbell, who was a keen supporter of Liverpool FC, bought the business Urban Barber four years ago.

He said: 'He was a lovely bloke who was always living life to the full. It's a real shame to hear what's happened.

'I think he lived alone but he was popular round here. If we had the football on he would always sit down and watch it with us.

'He was just so easy to get on with and I really feel for his family.'
