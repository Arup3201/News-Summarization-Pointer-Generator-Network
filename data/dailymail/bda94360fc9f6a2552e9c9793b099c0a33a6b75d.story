A former teacher convicted of having sex with a 15-year-old student in 2009 has been re-arrested - after her teen victim was found hiding in her closet.

Lisa Lavoie, 26,a former teacher at Holyoke middle school, was caught after a probation officer made an unannounced visit to her home.

He discovered the victim, now 18, hiding in Lavoie's closet.

Lavoie had been spared jail after the judge in her trial said he did not believe she was a sexual predator.

She was given a sentence of five years’ probation in January 2011, after pleading guilty to statutory rape.

Her re-arrest came after a probation officer made an unannounced call at Lavoie's home in Springfield, West Virginia.

As the probation officer looked round the flat, she found her former lover, now aged, 18, hiding in her bedroom closet.

Lavoie’s probation included several conditions including that she have no contact with the victim or his family, masslive.com reported.

When she appeared in court on Monday to face probation violation charges her lawyer claimed the 18 year old turned up at her apartment claiming he had no place to stay.

Defence lawyer David P. Hoose said given Lavoie’s psychological makeup and struggles with alcohol, the victim’s pleading with her fell 'on someone who will listen.'

Lavoie caused outrage two years ago when it was revealed she had been having a sexual affair with the teen.

She was a teacher at Maurice Donahue Elementary School and had met the 15 year old through friends.

The pair's affair came to an end when they were tracked down by police to a Super Motel 8. FBI agents and US Border Patrol were involved in the search for the couple after they ran off.

Lavoie pleaded guilty to rape and enticement of a child and was given five years’ probation instead of a prison sentence

Trial Judge Cornelius Moriarty defended the light sentence stating that he did not believe Lavoie was a sexual predator who was likely to reoffend.

'If I thought Lavoie was a manipulative sex offender likely to reoffend, my sentence would be very different,' he said.

'But I frankly do not believe that she is anything of the sort.'

At her latest bond hearing Lavoie was offered a $25,000 cash bail.

Her lawyers asked that she be allowed to live with her mother until her probation period has been completed.
