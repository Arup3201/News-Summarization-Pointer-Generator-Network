The police chief of Ferguson, Missouri has apologized to the family of Michael Brown - nearly two months after the unarmed teenager was shot dead by an officer.

In a video released on Thursday, Police Chief Tom Jackson apologized to Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr. for taking so long to remove the body of their son from the street.

He also said sorry to peaceful protesters for the police response during the subsequent marches.

'I want to say this to the Brown family: No one who has not experienced the loss of a child can understand what you're feeling. I am truly sorry for the loss of your son,' Jackson said to camera.

Speaking out: Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson released this video apology on Thursday morning to say sorry to the family of slain teen Michael Brown for leaving his body in the street for so long

'I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street. The time that it took involved very important work on the part of investigators, who were trying to collect evidence and gain a true picture of what happened that day, but it was just too long, and I am truly sorry for that.' 

It took police officers more than four hours to remove Brown's body from the street after he was shot dead by white police officer Darren Wilson on August 9. Brown, who was black, was not armed.

'Please know that the investigating officers meant no disrespect to the Brown family, to the African-American community or the people of Canfield,' Jackson went on. 'They were simply trying to do their jobs.'

He also said sorry for the police response to protesters. Crowds began marching in the days after the shooting and escalated into violence and looting in some places.

The police response was slammed as inept and Missouri Governor Jay Nixon ultimately put the Missouri State Highway Patrol in charge of policing the protests.

'I do want to say to any peaceful protester who did not feel that I did enough to protect their constitutional right to protest, I am sorry for that,' Jackson said. 

'The right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect. If anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry, I feel responsible, and I'm sorry.'

He also acknowledged how the situation blew up overnight and drew Ferguson into a discussion about race relations and the attitude of the police across the U.S. 

'Overnight I went from being a small-town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism, equality and the role of policing in that conversation,' he said. 'As chief of police, I want to be part of that conversation. I also want to be part of the solution.

'For any mistakes I've made, I take full responsibility.'

The Justice Department is investigating whether the Ferguson police used excessive force, whether constitutional rights of some residents are violated by traffic stops, searches and arrests, and if police engage in discriminatory practices.

Ongoing violence: On Tuesday, a memorial for Michael Brown was burned down in Ferguson

Jackson was not at the meeting but has said he welcomes the investigation.

Even now, unrest continues in the area.

Fire destroyed a memorial to Brown at the site of the shooting early on Tuesday, generating new anger among some residents. Police say the cause of the fire is under investigation.

The fire may have been the spark for a violent protest Tuesday night. One store was damaged by looting, another was set on fire, and police were attacked with rocks and bottles. Two officers suffered injuries when they were hit by rocks.

A state grand jury is weighing if Wilson will face criminal charges, but a decision isn't expected until mid-October at the earliest.
