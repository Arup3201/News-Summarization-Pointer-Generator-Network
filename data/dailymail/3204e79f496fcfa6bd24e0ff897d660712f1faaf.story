Dance Moms star Maddie Ziegler has spoken out to praise actor Shia LaBeouf after the pair starred together in a music video for Australian popstar Sia's new single Elastic Heart.

While the 12-year-old reality star, who also appeared in the video for Sia's number one hit Chandelier, did not address the recent accusations about the 'inappropriate' nature of the pair's performance, she described the 28-year-old actor as her 'buddy' and went on to congratulate him on his emotionally-charged dancing. 

'[Shia] really did [fit into the family on set],' she told Cosmopolitan.com.

'We're buddies': 12-year-old Dance Moms star Maddie Ziegler has described the close friendship that she and Shia formed while on set

Inappropriate? The music video for Sia's new song Elastic Heart has caused upset with some who feel its content is too suggestive

'Before we started the video Shia took me and my mom out to eat just to get to know each other because it'd be awkward just being like, "Hey, let's dance together" the first day, you know? 

'It's kind of weird. So you have to build that bond.'

The youngster, who is currently filming the fifth season of Lifetime reality hit Dance Moms, went on to add that, while she found Shia's method acting slightly bizarre, she was incredibly impressed with his overall performance - especially in light of his lack of professional dancing experience.

'I was confused [when they told me he was in the video], I was like, "Wait, does he dance?" And they were like, "Ehhh, no."' she explained. 

'To be honest, he wasn't that bad at dancing... 

'We had fun on set definitely, but when we got into it he got super serious. He was running around, he was punching the cage, and screaming and doing a lot of push-ups... I was a little intimidated but I understood.' 

Maddie added that she and Shia have stayed in touch following the performance, even revealing that the Transformers star sent her a text to congratulate her on a job well done.

Caged: In the video, Maddie and Shia play caged animals who begin fighting one another

The video, which sees Shia and Maddie take on the role of animals trapped in a large cage, while dancing around each other in a raw and dramatic way, has been slammed by some critics who say that its entire concept is wholly inappropriate.

'The Elastic Heart video would be magic if her dancing partner wasn't 30 years old, looked like a child predator and was a good dancer!' one Twitter user wrote about after seeing the clip. 

Another person on Facebook added: 'I understand that everyone thinks this is a piece of art, but I find it a little too sexual because why is a full grown man in a cage with a 12 year old and both wearing nude suits and making funny faces at each other.

'I find that disturbing.' 

Yesterday evening, Sia, 39, took to her Twitter account to apologize for any upset caused by the video, explaining that she had only hoped to create some 'emotional content'.

'All I can say is Maddie and Shia are two of the only actors I felt could play these two warring 'Sia' self states,' she explained.

'I apologize to those who feel triggered by Elastic Heart, my intention was to create some emotional content, not to upset anybody.' 

Meanwhile, fellow Dance Moms star Cathy Nesbitt-Stein has also spoken out against the video's content, according to TMZ.  

The stage mom and reality star claims she 'nearly threw up' while watching the video and went on to call the film 'vile'.

She also lashed out at Maddie's mother: 'I am flabbergasted Melissa would go to the levels she is going to get her daughter famous.'
