Happy ending: Just one week after her wedding Ria Scarr was forced to lie in a hospital bed which was tilted at a 45 degree angle to save baby Amelia

A bride swapped her exotic honeymoon for a stay in a hospital bed, with her legs elevated above her head, in a desperate bid to save her unborn baby.

Ria Scarr, 26, suffers from a weak cervix - which means it can not support the weight of a foetus -  after suffering two miscarriages.

Just one week after her wedding to long 
term partner David Scarr, she was forced to lie in a hospital bed which 
was tilted at a 45 degree angle – with her feet above her head – to 
reduce the pressure on her womb.

Ultrasound scans at five months showed the baby had dropped so far down it was just a few inches from the top of her cervix.

Under the supervision of Professor Siobhan Quenby, one of the world's leading experts in recurrent miscarriages, Mrs Scarr spent 24-hours-a-day in the bed at University Hospital in Coventry for six weeks, only getting out to go to the toilet.

She had to eat, read and watch television while lying virtually upside-down.

Mrs Scarr, a youth worker from Whitley, Coventry, said: 'I had to lie down with the bed tilted so my head was lower down than the rest of my body, basically my legs had to be raised higher than my head.

'I was allowed to walk to the toilet quickly but that was it. Thinking back now I really don't know how I did it.

'I think it was just knowing what the end result was going to be really.

Wedding day worry: The couple had planned to spend a fortnight's honeymoon in Egypt sipping cocktails but just one week after she married her boyfriend of four years she was left confined to a hospital bed while doctors monitored her closely

Determination: Mrs Scarr tragically lost two babies after going into early labour so was determined to save her unborn child when she fell pregnant again last May

'I watched a lot of DVDs over and over again, especially the 'Twilight' series.

'I probably watched all of the three films 10 times each.

'David visited every day after work and our parents brought me food because the hospital stuff was horrible.

'It was hell but it was worth it in the end.'

Mrs Scarr, tragically lost two babies after going into early labour so was 
determined to save her unborn child when she fell pregnant again last 
May.

On August 26 – 22 weeks into the pregnancy - Mrs Scarr, married David, 29, a delivery driver.

The
couple had planned to spend a fortnight’s honeymoon lying on a beach in
Egypt sipping cocktails but just one week after she married her 
boyfriend of four years she was left confined to a hospital bed while 
doctors monitored her closely.

Mrs Scarr, added: 'When I fell pregnant again I was completely shocked and 
anxious. Because of what happened before, my first thought was not 
excitement like with most women, I was anxious about what was going to 
happen.

'Even on our wedding day I was worrying what if it happens today and I have another early labour.

'I
had my first dance and then I had to sit down for the rest of the night
while everyone else got drunk around me. I don't think I saw David all 
night.'

Struggle: After six weeks in hospital she returned home where she was forced to lie with her legs raised on the sofa. And on December 22 she went into labour at 37 weeks and gave birth to baby Amelia, weighing 5lbs and 15ozs

Dedication: Ria's husband, David visited every day after work. 'Our parents brought me food because the hospital stuff was horrible. It was hell but it was worth it in the end, said Mrs Scarr

After six weeks in hospital she returned home where she was forced to lie with her legs raised on the sofa.

And on December 22 she went into labour at 37 weeks and gave birth to baby Amelia, weighing 5lbs and 15ozs.

The birth went so smoothly the couple were able to take their healthy newborn baby home on Christmas Eve.

Prof
Quenby said: 'Ria stayed lying head down and moved very little. 
Everyone involved in her care is absolutely thrilled that Ria was able 
to go up to her due date to have Amelia and that they are both doing so 
well.

Baby Amelia has suffered no health 
problems because of the complicated pregnancy and the delighted mum 
says the successful birth means she won't rule out the chance trying 
again

'The benefit of bed rest is that it prevents the cervix opening too early and stops the membranes moving down the cervix where they can easily rupture leading to very early delivery and heartbreak for the family.'

Baby Amelia has suffered no health problems because of Mrs Scarr's complicated pregnancy and the delighted mum says the successful birth means she won't rule out the chance trying again.

Mrs Scarr added: 'I definitely would like to have another child but I would need to find out if I would have to go through it all again.'
