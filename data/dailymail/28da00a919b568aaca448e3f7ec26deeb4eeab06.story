Iran has activated a heavy-water production plant to produce plutonium for a nuclear bomb, it was claimed last night.

Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency have been banned from scrutinising the heavily-guarded Arak facility for the past 18 months.

But satellite images made public yesterday show clouds of steam emerging from the site, which is 150 miles south-west of the capital Tehran.

The images emerged as the world’s leading countries resumed talks yesterday with Iran over its nuclear project, which the Islamic regime says is for peaceful purposes.

The talks in Kazakhstan were the first in eight months between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany.

Western diplomats described the first day of the two day talks as ‘useful’.

But they said Iranian negotiators did not immediately respond to demands that Tehran closes its underground nuclear facility Fordow
near the holy city of Qom, which is at  the centre of their concerns.

The satellite images showed the site surrounded by anti-aircraft missiles and other military.

The underground Fordow nuclear facility located deep in the mountains 
near have long caused anxiety and western powers are demanding Tehran 
closes the plant.

For years, the powers had attempted a mix of economic pressure and 
diplomacy to persuade Iran to scale back its atomic work, but Tehran has
insisted that sanctions are lifted before it complies with any demands.

A Western official says the latest round of talks between world powers and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program have ended.

It was not immediately clear what, if anything, was resolved in during the two days of negotiations that ended Wednesday.

But Iranian state TV reported that technical experts for each side will meet in Istanbul in coming weeks to discuss the latest proposals.

Iran's top negotiator, Saeed Jalili, and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton were expected to talk to reporters later.

The Western official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media.

'It is clear that nobody expects to come from Almaty with a fully done 
deal,' the EU spokesman, Michael Mann, said before the meeting started.

Iran has told the IAEA that it will begin operating the reactor at Arak 
in the first three months of 2014 - a time when many believe will push 
Israel into a first strike response.

And though Tehran still lacks the technology to reprocess plutonium and 
use it for a  weapon, North Korea has successfully developed that 
technology and some analysts speculate that Iran could do the same.

Major powers offered Iran limited sanctions relief in return for a halt 
to the most controversial part of its atomic work during the first day 
of the nuclear talks, and Iran promised to respond with a ‘proposal on 
the same scale’.

Last month Iran denied reports of a major explosion at its Fordow nuclear facility, one of its most sensitive uranium enrichment sites.

The
country described the claims as Western propaganda which it said 
is intended to influence upcoming international nuclear negotiations.

The
reports originated with Israeli intelligence sources in Tel Aviv, who spoke of an explosion damaging the Fordow bunker 
which is situated deep under a mountain near the religious city of Qom.

In late 2011 Fordow began producing 
uranium enriched to 20 percent fissile purity - below the 90 per cent 
level used in nuclear bombs, but very high compared with the 3.5 percent
level needed for nuclear energy plants.

The Islamic state says it is producing 
20 percent uranium to make fuel for a research reactor in Tehran that 
produces medical isotopes, but the move provoked fears that the uranium could be converted to bomb-grade.

Several U.N. Security Council resolutions have ordered Iran to suspend all uranium enrichment.
