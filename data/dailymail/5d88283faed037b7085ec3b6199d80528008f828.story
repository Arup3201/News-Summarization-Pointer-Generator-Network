When a Florida mom was browsing her Facebook, she came across a post from the local police department, trying to identify a shoplifting suspect.

She saw the teenager had been caught on camera stealing $670 worth of Playstation controllers from a Target in Casselbury.

Then on closer inspection, she realized it was her own son.

She then marched into 18-year-old Joel Brown's room at 1am on Wednesday, woke him up and called the police.

CCTV footage: Joel Brown's mother was browsing Facebook when she noticed her son was the robbery suspect police were looking to identify in Casselbury, Florida

Sgt. Chris Pamatian told WESH-TV: 'She didn't wait till morning. She took care of it right then.'

Officers then arrived and found him wearing the same FILA sweatshirt he was wearing during the alleged robberies. Brown was then arrested.

Police said they recovered five of the controllers, but several had already been sold to area GameStop stores.

Brown is being held at the Seminole County Jail on a $2,000 bond. He has been charged with retail theft and shoplifting.

Pamatian said it was unusual for officers to receive tip-offs from mothers. 

Caught: She walked into the 18-year-old's room at 1am on Wednesday and called the police straight away. Officers then arrested him after they arrived and found him wearing the same Fila sweatshirt (mugshot right)

Recovery: Police said they retrieved five of the controllers stolen from the Target, but several had already been sold to GameStop stores in the area
