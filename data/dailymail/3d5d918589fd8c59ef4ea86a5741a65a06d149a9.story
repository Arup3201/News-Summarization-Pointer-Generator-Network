Denies racist attack: Alec Baldwin (pictured with wife Hilaria Thomas today) denies being racist in an altercation with a photographer

Alec Baldwin has denied making a racist attack on a photographer but admits shouting abuse at a woman reporter during the altercation with paparazzi in New York.

Photographer G.N. Miller claims Baldwin yelled racial epithets and other insults while he was trying to take photographs of the actor outside his Manhattan apartment on Sunday.

New York Post reporter Tara Palmeri also says he shouted abuse at her as she tried to ask him questions about his wife Hilaria's lawsuit involving her work as a yoga instructor.

Today Baldwin, 54, looking particularly drained and worn out, admitted that he had shouted abuse at the pair, yelling: 'I hope you choke to death.'

In an interview with Gothamist he argued that while it was a hateful comment, it was not one meant to be taken seriously.

The 30 Rock star allegedly called Miller, who is black, a racial epithet, a 'coon', 'a drug dealer', a 'crackhead' and made disparaging remarks about his mother, according to Miller's police statement.

The New York Post claims that
 the comments were recorded on Ms Palmeri’s tape recorder and that the 
tape had been sent to police for investigation.

Baldwin admitted today that he has struggled to deal with the press.

He told Gothamist that: ‘The one 
element of culpability I have is I did let it get to me, and I have been
 confrontational with them.’

The
 actor filed an assault complaint on Monday after the incident 
while the photographer later filed a harassment complaint.

Baldwin said that Miller had followed him as he walked along the street and kept putting his camera right into the actor’s face, making him feel threatened.

Baldwin said: ‘I want to say on the record that I've had a lot of experience with this, and I've never had someone do it as blatantly as him.’

The New York Post reported that investigators were taking the allegations ‘very seriously’ and that Baldwin had been questioned by hate crimes detectives about the altercation.

Baldwin refused to comment to a mass of reporters outside his apartment building today.

Pursued: Baldwin had been approached on Sunday to comment on a lawsuit against his wife due to harsh conditions a New Yorker endured in her yoga class in January

Before the altercation on Sunday morning, Baldwin had been approached by a New York Post reporter and was asked for a comment about the lawsuit against his wife, Hilaria Thomas.  

The Post claims that Baldwin then grabbed the female reporter by her arm and said: 'I want you to choke to death.'  

She allegedly recorded the comment and played it to police.  

His wife, Ms Thomas took to Twitter to defend her husband.

She posted: ‘Shame on anyone who says my husband is racist. If you could only see/hear the dangerous things paparazzi will do & the lies to get a “story”.’

Ms Thomas is being sued by New Yorker Spencer Wolff due to harsh conditions he endured during a yoga class she conducted, it was revealed last week.

Mr Wolff says he suffered ‘serious’ and ‘severe’ injuries and ‘emotional upset’ during her January 15 class at Yoga Vida in Greenwich Village, according to the lawsuit he filed in Manhattan Supreme Court.

The lawsuit does not specify exactly how Wolff was injured.

Wolff does, however, cite the ‘overcrowded’ class and Ms Baldwin's ‘negligence’ as two of the causes of his alleged injuries.

Ms Baldwin, 28, has been teaching yoga since 2005, according to Yoga Vida’s website.
