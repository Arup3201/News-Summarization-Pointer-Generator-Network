With her floppy hat, designer boots and chic coat, Harper Beckham captured the hearts of parents everywhere on her way to New York Fashion Week recently.

Yet some eagle-eyed mums and dads also spotted a business opportunity: with Victoria and David lookalikes forging lucrative careers mimicking the couple, surely the market was ripe for Harpers as well?

Indeed, Susan Scott’s Lookalikes agency has 32 Harpers on its books, with a rush of approaches from new hopefuls.

We picked our top ten Harpers — and here they are, as cute as buttons, looking just like the famous little fashionista.

Spot the difference: The real Harper Beckham, left, and lookalike Emilia Robbins, from Wrexham, right

Mum can't tell them apart 

Emilia Robins, three-and-a-half, lives in Wrexham, North Wales, with mum Gemma, 28, dad Simon, 35, who run a camper van building firm, and brother Mason, six. Gemma says: 

When I show pictures of Harper to Emilia, she says ‘That’s me, Mummy. Who’s that strange man or woman holding me?’ That’s how uncanny the resemblance is, even she can’t tell her and Harper apart. And if someone were to put pictures of them side by side I think I would struggle to say who was who.

Emilia attracts a lot of stares, which she likes because she’s a confident, friendly girl. I’ve heard the Beckham children are very polite and I’m proud to say Emilia has lovely manners, too. Emilia really is a little cracker.

I’m not a pushy mother, so I will only put her up for things she wants to do, as long as I don’t have to pretend to be Victoria — I don’t think anyone would fall for that.

Seeing double: Susan Scott’s Lookalikes agency has 32 Harpers on its books, including Annabel Wanner-Halder, left, and Phoebe Lowe, right

Modelling will pay for university

Annabel Wanner-Halder, three-and-a-half, lives in Beaconsfield, Bucks, with mum Jo, 40, dad Simon, 43, both IT consultants, and sister Amelia, two. Jo says:

My mum was the first to notice how much Annabel looks like Harper. Last year, we were on a flight to Madrid when the air stewardess touched me on the arm and said ‘Your daughter looks just like Harper Beckham.’

So a year ago, Mum sent her photograph to a lookalike agency and they signed her up. Any money Annabel earns will go into a savings account for university.

I’m mystified how Annabel came by her looks: I’m more Geri Halliwell and Simon looks more like Griff Rhys Jones. It’s bizarre we should have produced almost identical daughters.

Strangers stop us in the street

Phoebe Lowe, three, lives with mum Naomi, a nursery nurse, and brother Joshua, eight, in Worcester. Naomi says:

Ever since Phoebe was tiny, strangers have approached me in shops and parks to comment on her resemblance to Harper.

I’d always act surprised. It was touching seeing Harper with her big brother because Joshua loves his little sister, too.

It’s not just the long light-brown hair that makes Harper and Phoebe so alike, it’s their dark eyes, lips and the shape of their faces.

So on a whim, I decided to send a picture to the agency a few days ago.

I wish our daughters weren’t the only thing Victoria and I have in common: I’ve got a huge crush on David!

Decoy: Bobbi Hutchins, left, lives near close to Harper's grandparents, and Sienna Gibbs-Cook, right

We live next to Harper’s granny

Bobbi Hutchins, three, lives near Hertford with stay-at-home mum Karlie, 30, and dad Paul, 31, a computer maintenance worker. She has a brother Paul, two, and sister Cameron, 11. Karlie says:

People used to say I looked like Posh Spice because I have long straight brown hair and a turned-up nose — so it’s no surprise Bobbi is a dead ringer for Harper. It’s a great honour — she’s gorgeous.

I joked to my husband that Bobbi was being trained to be a decoy for Harper, because her grandparents — Victoria’s parents — live nearby. I’ve been to their house as a child, when they sold some furniture. They let us see their trophy room full of Victoria’s platinum CDs and David’s football trophies.

I’d love to say her brother dotes on her the way the Beckham boys adore Harper, but they mostly squabble.

She's made thousands of pounds 

Sienna Gibbs-Cook, four, lives in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, with Sophie Cook, 33, a stay-at-home mum, dad Lee Gibbs, 37, a printer, and sister Tahlia, ten. Sophie says:

When Sienna was two, I was shopping in Waitrose when I was asked by another customer if I was Harper Beckham’s nanny.

She has appeared at several corporate events — usually with a David and Victoria lookalike — and in newspapers and magazines. We put all her earnings into a savings account which she can access when she is 18. There are several thousand pounds in it already. Of course, Sienna has no idea who Harper is, but she loves the little boots and coats she wears on photoshoots. She loves travelling on the train, too, so every time we go to an event it’s like a little holiday for her.

We’re all very excited whenever she is in the paper — and, if I’m honest, she’s a bit spoilt.

Like father, like daughter: Left, Amelia Bricknell's father looks like David Beckham, and right, Colby Brander-Stark dresses in sophisticated clothes like Harper

Daddy looks like Becks, too!

Amelia Bricknell, three, lives in Grays, Essex, with stay-at-home mum Sarah Johnson, 31, and dad James Bricknell, 36, a printer. Sarah says:

My friend rang me last week and said: ‘I’ve realised why I always feel like I know Harper Beckham — she looks just like your Amelia!’

Amelia has always looked like Harper. When she was pictured in that black dress sitting on her dad’s knee, then at the airport being carried by big brother Brooklyn, the resemblance was uncanny.

Some friends say James looks a bit like David! David and Victoria are good role models.

A fashionista at the age of two 

Colby Brander-Stark, two-and-a-half, lives in Radlett, Hertfordshire, with mum Hilary, 32, a Metropolitan Police controller, dad Michael, 32, a police officer, and brother Leo, five. Hilary says:

Colby is 12 months younger than Harper, so when I see photographs of her in the newspaper, I think ‘That’s what my daughter will look like next year.’

They even have the same Bugaboo buggy; black with a pink hood. Like Victoria, I like dressing my daughter in sophisticated clothes — shirts and leggings in black and grey, rather than Mickey Mouse tops.

Friends are always texting and emailing me pictures of Harper and writing ‘Colby!’ in the subject line.

I didn’t have any reservations about signing Colby up to a lookalikes agency because it’s not like saying ‘My daughter’s so pretty she should be a model’. Everyone wants their daughter to be a model, but not everybody’s child looks like a celebrity, it just so happens mine does.

Ambitious: Sienna Maunsell, left, already likes to wear high heels while Violet Stringer, right, wants to be Rapunzel when she grows up

Already in high heels

Sienna Maunsell, three, lives with stay-at-home mum Jennifer, 28, dad Michael, 28, a printer, brother Keane, nine, and sister Emelia, one, in Manchester. Jennifer says:

I didn’t know who Harper Beckham was when a friend of my mum’s said she looked like Sienna. I’ve no idea who she gets her looks from as sadly neither my husband nor I look anything like the Beckhams.

Michael likes to play football, but that’s the only similarity.

Sienna is a little fahionista in the making. She likes wearing my high heels and even paints her nails. Pink is her favourite colour. It does get a bit messy. Like Harper, she is a bit of a Daddy’s girl and has Michael wrapped round her little finger.

She’d rather be Rapunzel!

Violet Stringer, three, lives in Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire, with mum Macey, 37, a handcrafter and dad Nick, 45, who runs outdoor markets. She has six siblings; Freddie, two, Savannah, 11, Harrison, 12, Alexander, 16, Rebecca, 14, and Jordan, 18. Macey says:

I sometimes see pictures in magazines of David and Harper and wonder what he’s doing holding my little girl. Like Harper, Violet has long hair — she wants to be Rapunzel when she grows up, and she loves dressing up.

You’ll usually find her in a dress and wellies. I think it’s flattering she looks like Harper. Violet also loves her dummy, but I only let her have it in the car.

Sian Stafford, three, enjoys her dummy just as much as Harper, but her mother plans on getting rid of it soon

Dummy double 

Sian Stafford, three, lives in Romford, Essex, with full-time mum Marie, 29, dad Dean, 29, a roofer, sister Louise, nine, and brother Zack, 18 months. Marie says:

Physical resemblance is not the only thing Sian has in common with Harper — she also still has a dummy. I’ll get rid of it before she’s four because I’m worried about it damaging her teeth.

I don’t suppose the Beckhams are concerned because they can afford the very best orthodontic treatment.

I think David and Victoria are good role models because, despite their careers, they still manage to spend a lot of time with their children.

And I joke to friends that having a daughter who looks like theirs is the next best thing to having the Beckhams’ fame and fortune.
