The mother of nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, who was gunned down two years ago outside of a supermarket in Tucson last year delivered a powerful message to lawmakers demanding harsher laws for gun control.

Roxanna Green, Christina’s mother, said in a television commercial today that elected officials must take serious action so innocent children like her daughter are not killed.

She said, ‘We have to demand a plan.’ The ad will first air in the Arizona city at 10:10am, the exact moment a lone gunman opened fire at a political event featuring former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in 2011.

Demands: Roxanna Green, who lost her daughter Christina-Taylor, 9, in 2011 at the Tucson shootings, appears in a commercial demanding a plan from lawmakers

Loss: Christina-Taylor Green, 9, was killed at a constituent meeting outside of a Safeway after a shooter opened fire

Scene: Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and 12 others were wounded outside of this Safeway parking lot; six, including Christina-Taylor, were killed

The video, part of the Demand a Plan campaign, opens with Ms Green telling the parents who lost children in December’s Sandy Hook massacre that she knows ‘how much it hurts.’

The mother continues: ‘My nine-year-old daughter was murdered in the Tucson shooting.

‘I have one question for our political leaders – when will you find the courage to stand up to the gun lobby. Whose child has to die next?’ she asks.

The ad was paid for by the Mayor’s Coalition Against Illegal Guns, an initiative run by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The mayor, a firm supporter of gun control, said in a statement that Mrs Green’s poignant message made it all the more clear that new laws are needed to protect the country’s citizens.

'We need political leaders to hear Roxanna loud and clear: we cannot wait any longer for you to do something about gun violence.  Another child should not have to die,’ the mayor, 70, said.

Vigil: Thousands came out to hold candlelight vigils following the Tucson shooting in 2011

Taking a stand: Green, left, stands with Chris Foye, who's son Chris Owens was killed by a stay bullet in Harlem in 2009 at a gun violence press conference days after Sandy Hook

Mr Bloomberg was on MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe’ this morning discussing the video and the idea that some lawmakers are hesitant to vote on gun control laws for fear it would hurt their political career.

But the mayor said that lobbying by the National Rifle Association was ‘notoriously unsuccessful in this last election.

'My nine-year-old daughter was murdered in the Tucson shooting. I
have one question for our political leaders; when will you find the 
courage to stand up to the gun lobby. Whose child has to die next?'

'They set one major priority, to defeat Barack Obama.’

He said that no overly dramatic measures need to be taken to implement control. ‘All you have to do is accept reasonable restrictions,’ saying that no one is trying to take away the right to target practice or weapons for home protection.

Referring to Mrs Green, Mr Bloomberg said: ‘Every parent sits there and thinks, if it was my kid.’

Christina-Taylor was one of six people killed when gunman Jared Lee Loughner opened fire outside of a Safeway grocery store where Rep. Gabby Giffords was speaking.

Rep. Giffords was shot in the head and was critically wounded. Twelve other people were also injured.

Change: New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg spoke on 'Morning Joe' today about Mrs Green and the gun control issue

Grief: Family, including mother Roxanna Green, third from right, father John, and son Dallas Green kneel in prayer behind the casket during the funeral service for Christina-Taylor in 2011

Remembering: A memorial for the girl was presented in April of 2011; it was created from a beam from ground zero, a piece of steel from the Pentagon and a large rock from the Flight 93 crash site

From a young age, the bright child had an interest in politics, and was attending the constituent event to meet Rep. Giffords and ask her questions on what it was like being a politician.

President Obama said of Christina-Taylor four days after the shooting that the girl was dancing in rain puddles in heaven. The president said: ‘I want America to be as good as she imagined it.’

Mrs Green, along with her husband John, have since founded the Christina-Taylor Green Memorial Foundation, an organization committed to doing good deeds in her name.

Loughner, who was convicted of the shooting, was given seven consecutive life sentences, plus 140 years, last November.

Massacre: On December 13, 20 children and six adults were killed by a lone gunman; here, crosses pay tribute to the victims

Mrs Green visited the small town of Sandy Hook, Connecticut on December 17, three days after the latest horrific mass shooting.

She told AZCentral.com that seeing a row of 26 ribbons as she entered the town gave her goosebumps and sent a whole new wave of anxiety rushing through her. 

She said that visiting the town ‘brought back the whole thing.’

The mother added: ‘Not that it should happen anywhere, no matter what kind of town, but this place was like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting.’
