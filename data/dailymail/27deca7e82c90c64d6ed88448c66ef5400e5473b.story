A former police sniffer dog has remembered his training and tracked down his owner’s purse after she was pick-pocketed at a pet shop.

Tracey Thompson from Blackshaw Moor, Staffordshire, was devastated after distraction thieves stole her purse as she visited Pets at Home in Longton.

She was so upset she and her daughter Jenny, 25, took their dog Sam to the shop in the hope he might be able to use his nose to track down the purse.

Wonder dog: Jenny, 25, and Tracey Thompson, 48, with their dog Sam who picked up the scent at Pets at Home dragged them to an industrial estate where he sniffed around and found Mrs Thompson's stolen purse

They were amazed when the two-year-old 
German Shepherd picked up the scent immediately and dragged his owners 
to an industrial estate more than half a kilometre away where they found
the stolen goods.

The purse contained photographs of Tracey's brother Paul who died aged 21, and a snap from her daughter’s wedding, as well as more than £100 in cash. 

Mrs Thompson said: 'When we got there he had a sniff around. I gave him the command to search and he picked up the scent and set-off running.

Good dog: German Shepherd Sam, two, had completed his police dog training and had been in the job six weeks when Mrs Thompson bought him a year ago - but he still remembered all his training

'I followed him around half a kilometre away to an industrial estate. He lay down in the grass and kept pointing with his nose.

'I looked down and there was my mum’s credit card. He then set off again and kept trying to pull me into a bramble bush.

'He pushed his way through the brambles and in-between his legs was the purse. He’s a wonder dog. Lassie and Benji have got nothing on him.

'He’s got a good nose on him and he was a junior police dog.'

Hero pooch: Jennifer, left, and friend Tara Hall, 26, with Sam whose heroics led to the arrest of a 26-year-old woman who has been bailed while police continue their investigation into the alleged distraction burglary

Sam, who also discovered some stolen medical equipment, had completed his police dog training and had worked for six weeks before he was bought by the Thompson family a year ago after they took a shining to him.

Mrs Thompson, 48, said: 'I couldn’t believe what happened. I knew Jenny had taken him down there but I never thought he would find anything. He’s amazing.

'A couple engaged me in conversation and then took my purse. I rushed after them but they swore at me and ran off.'

A Staffordshire police spokesman said: 'A 26-year-old woman from Stoke-on-Trent was arrested on Thursday in connection with the theft.

'She has been bailed, pending further inquiries, to a date in September. Our inquiries into this incident are ongoing.'
