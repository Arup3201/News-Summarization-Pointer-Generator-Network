Tragedy: Joanna Hall, 35, lay dying for five hours after she was stabbed by Steven Williams

A woman whose frenzied boyfriend stabbed and slashed her 40 times named him as the culprit from her hospital bed, then slipped into a coma and died.

Joanna Hall, 35, begged unemployed chef Steven Williams to dial 999 as she lay bleeding on the floor but he waited five hours - then laughed down the phone to the operator.

Williams told police a mystery knifeman had broken in while he was shopping at Sainsbury's.

But a jury found him guilty of murder after they were told of his girlfriend's deathbed confession.

Williams, 30, from Tenby, west Wales, is expected to be jailed for life tomorrow.

Swansea Crown Court heard the pair had been dating for about six months when Williams grew suspicious that his girlfriend had given him a sexually transmitted disease.

On March 16 last year he arrived at her flat in Tenby after drinking whisky and launched into an argument.

It escalated and he stabbed and slashed her repeatedly across her breasts and stomach with a kitchen knife.

Then, as she lay bleeding on the floor, Williams went out for 10 minutes to buy more whisky, sarcastically telling her not to go anywhere while he was gone.

When she was eventually airlifted to hospital in Swansea - only after she had started falling unconscious - Joanna had enough energy to point the finger at Williams in conversations with police, hospital staff and her sister Georgina before slipping into a coma from which she never recovered.

Her life support machine was switched off almost three weeks after the attack.

According to her sister, she said from her deathbed: 'It was Steven Williams. He turned up at my flat after drinking whisky, there was argument and he flipped.

'He began stabbing me - then sat with me smoking a cigarette and said: “Will you just die?"'

The court was also read Joanna's police statement, which said: 'He started shouting at me and went into the kitchen and came back with a knife.

'I asked him what he was going to do with it and he said: “Watch me”.

'He stabbed me in the back and the knife got stuck but he managed to get it out and carried on stabbing me.'

Williams was arrested outside a nearby supermarket shortly after the stabbing.

He denied the attack throughout the trial - but the jury was shown evidence of injuries he sustained as Joanna tried to fight him off.

Prosecutor Elwen Evans described Joanna's injuries, some of which were too distressing to be published.

Sentence: Williams is expected to be jailed for life tomorrow at Swansea Crown Court after he was found guilty

'Her condition was very serious indeed,' she told the court. 'She had suffered substantial blood loss.

'She was flown by helicopter to hospital where she underwent surgery and was put on a life support machine.

'Her organs stopped functioning and she died in April 2013, 20 days after the attack, but before going unconscious she was able to give an account of what had happened to her.'

The jury found Williams guilty by a majority of 10 to two, the smallest normally allowed in the law, after a three week trial.

In a statement reported by WalesOnline, Joanna's family said: 'Williams is an evil monster who needs to be locked away so that he can't hurt anyone else in the same way as Jo.

'Nothing will bring Jo back or change the heinous things that Williams did to her and unfortunately we now have to live with that for the rest of our lives.'

He will be sentenced tomorrow. No psychiatric reports were prepared.
