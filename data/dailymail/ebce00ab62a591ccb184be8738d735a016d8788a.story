A chief constable who bears an uncanny resemblance to actor James Nesbitt keeps being mistaken for the Irish star, who is currently playing a police commissioner in a new TV series.

Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer of Devon and Cornwall Police has been compared to the star of the 'Cold Feet' and 'Missing' after it was pointed out how much the pair look-a-like.

It comes as Mr Nesbitt is currently playing the part of Richard Miller, a police commissioner in the Channel 4 series Babylon.

The similarities were pointed out after the commander of the Devon and Cornwall force posted a photo of himself on Twitter for a question and answer session.

One Twitter user quipped: 'At first glance I thought it was James Nesbitt! :-)'

While another user, Pete Best added: 'That's 'Cold Feet' not 'Flat Feet' #joke #honest.'

But Chief Constable Sawyer, who is in charge of the country's fifth largest force quickly tweeted back, saying 'If only I had his money!'

And a picture posted on Facebook of Mr Sawyer by the Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Hogg, also saw people point out how similar the two men look.

Facebook user Peter Sinclair wrote under the picture: 'James Nesbitt moonlighting!'

While at Scotland Yard he led the 1999 investigation into the Ladbroke Grove Rail Disaster and also served as the head of counter-terrorism.
