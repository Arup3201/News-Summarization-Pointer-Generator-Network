Google is testing a mysterious device in the homes of its employees, according to a recent application for a 'special wireless licence'.Â 

All that is known of the mystery gadget is that it is being tested in 252 homes, it accesses the internet via wi-fi and connects to other electronics via Bluetooth.

The news has sparked rumours that Google is relaunching its Google TV service - or that it is testing Android@Home, a 'home automation' technology announced in 2011, that would allow Android apps to control home devices such as washing machines and mood lighting.

The prototype gadget was the subject of an 
application for a special wireless licence to America's FCC, the Federal
Communications Commission.

The news sparked a wave of speculation that Google is about to re-enter the TV market - with the use of the word 'throughput' in the application lending weight to the idea that video streaming is involved.

'Google is developing an entertainment device that requires testing outside the laboratory environment,' the application said.

'The device is in the prototype phase.'

The device could be a new version of Google TV, a web-streaming service which the search giant launched in 2010, but which has remained unpopular

Google's TV service has yet to launch in Europe. In America, it has so far met mixed reviews, and widespread indifference.

Logitech, makers of one of the first Google TV devices - a set-top box - lost a reported $100 million on their gadgets.

Television channels such as NBC have blocked their web-TV offerings from appearing on Google TV devices.
