She was seven years old and  playing with a teddy at her side.

Every now and again she would give  it a hug or swing it by the ears as  she spoke.

The teddy was a white bear called Minty. The little girl was a crucial witness in the April Jones murder trial.

Yesterday, in juvenile, matter-of-fact tones, she described what she saw at the moment the prosecution say April was abducted and driven off to her death.

Hearing: A film of April Jones's best friend describing to police when the schoolgirl disappeared was played to Mold Crown Court

Heartbroken: April Jones's parents Paul and 
Coral (pictured today) were in court to hear evidence from their daughter's best friend, who said April happily got into a Land Rover - the last time she was seen

The two best friends were playing in 
the street when she noticed a man standing by a Land Rover or van. That,
she said, was 'how April got missing'.

In her distinct Welsh accent she 
added: 'The man didn't take her in the van – she got into the van, 
having a happy face,  she had.

'She wasn't upset. She didn't say she 
was going to go in it. She wasn't crying – she was happy. I don't know 
why she wanted to go because her mum and dad told her not to get into 
cars...'

The seven-year-old's testimony was  
originally given to police the day after  five-year-old April 
disappeared in October last year.

It was filmed and played to the trial 
at Mold Crown Court yesterday. Then she gave evidence by live video link
from an undisclosed location 80 miles away in Aberystwyth.

She offered Minty a drink from a plastic bottle, put her chin in her hands, and waited for questions from the court.

Suspect: Mark Bridger arrives in court (left), and the jury heard more evidence claiming it was him (right) who abducted and murdered April last October

Evidence: April's seven-year-old friend was later questioned by video link, and was asked to draw the vehicle and person she believed took her friend

In different circumstances, she might 
have been any schoolgirl suddenly asked to describe to a teacher what 
she did over the weekend. She laughed, fidgeted, played with her hair 
and munched on a packet of crisps.

But the testimony she gave to a court 
yesterday marked a key stage in the trial – and dramatically 
contradicted the account given by April's killer.

Former slaughterman Mark Bridger 
claims he accidentally ran April over, drove off with her dead or dying 
in his Land Rover, then panicked and lost all recollection of what he 
did with her.

Yesterday, out of sight of the seven-year-old, he fixed the court video screen with a gaze and muttered to himself in the dock.

Not once did the jury of nine women 
and three men hear the child witness say she had seen  her best friend 
run over. In her recorded interview, the girl sat on a sofa with a toy 
bunny called Mr Bumble on her lap.

She was asked by a policewoman what happened.

'We were just playing until the man 
came,' she said. 'We were going to go home because it was a little bit 
dark. I said, “April come on!” '

Upsetting: April Jones was shown on CCTV inside her local leisure centre after going swimming. The time shows almost 5.30pm and within two hours she had disappeared

When she turned round, however, she saw April with the man.

She explained she recognised the 
vehicle because she had seen two friends in it before. The children she 
named were the children of Mark Bridger, the jury has heard.

April's parents would never have let her get into the van with anyone, she said.

But she saw the man talking to April then watched her get in.

'She got in through the driver's way,'
she said. 'The two back doors were locked. April tried to open them, 
she did, and it wouldn't work. She climbed over and climbed into the 
back seat. Then the Land Rover drove off.'

A few minutes later April's brother 
came running towards her and said it was time for April to go home. 
'Then I said what happened. I gave April's bike to him, and got my bike,
and he went back and told his mum. My mum called the police, she did.'

The witness, who cannot be named because of her age, asked police at one stage: 'Can I go and see my mum?'

After a break she returned to draw the
vehicle, adding a 'stick man' to show where the person she saw was 
standing. She wrote' Land Rover' on the vehicle she had drawn.

Footage: A camera at the local Tuffins garage spotted Bridger's car, which may have contained April at the time and may have been seen by April's best friend, the court has heard

Hunt: Police launched Britain's biggest ever search after April Jones disappeared, but she has never been found

Trial: The seven-year-old appeared at Mold Crown Court (pictured) via video link, alongside her favourite toys

Lounge: This is Mark Bridger's living room, where forensics found blood and bone fragments, a room which was shown to jurors

Visit: Jurors arrive by coach at the home of Mark Bridger, Mount Pleasant in Ceinws, Mid Wales, on the third day of his trial for the abduction and murder of April Jones. it is surrounded by trees, outbuildings and a river runs down its left side

From time to time the girl appeared live on screen to be asked if she wanted a break from watching her recorded evidence.

She wore a pink cardigan and a white 
headband in her long dark hair, and sounded considerably more grown up 
than she did in her interview, despite the fact that only seven months 
had passed.

The judge, Mr Justice Griffith 
Williams, introduced himself with a wave and explained he was not 
wearing a wig in case she did not like it.

The 68-year-old former Royal Welch 
Fusiliers lieutenant sported a plain grey suit but kept his  judicial 
collar so that she could identify him.

Next it was time for her to speak to 
the barrister who introduced himself as 'the one in the orange tie' – 
Brendan Kelly QC, defending Bridger. The court has been told Bridger 
claims the seven-year-old's account is a 'fabrication' and 'utterly 
untrue'.

In cross examination, she was asked if
she saw April 'off her bike and lying on the floor very near to where 
the Land Rover was'.

No, she said. 'She was talking but she was standing up when she was talking to the man.'

The girl said she did not see  him 
bending down and did not see April on the floor, adding: 'The  man 
didn't carry her into the  front seat.'

Bridger, 47, denies abduction, murder and perverting the course of justice.

The trial continues.
