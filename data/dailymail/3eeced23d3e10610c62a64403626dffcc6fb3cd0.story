The Today Show team paid tribute today to a beloved colleague who was killed in Sunday morning's Metro-North train derailment in New York City.

James Lovell, 58, a married father-of-four, was a staffer at NBC and had been on his way to work on the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting when he was killed.

Today show executive producer Don Nash shared a message with colleagues on Mr Lovell's death: 'Jim worked on TODAY for over 20 years. He was not only a skilled technician but also one of the nicest guys you ever met. You may have seen him working at many of our outdoor concerts. He always had a smile on his face and was quick to share a friendly greeting.

'Jim is survived by his wife, Nancy Montgomery, three sons, Hudson, Jack and Finn and a daughter, Brooke. On behalf of all of us who had the pleasure of working with Jim, our deepest sympathies and condolences go out to all of them.'

The derailment in the Bronx claimed the lives of at least four people and left some 68 passengers injured - 11 of them critically.

Mr Lovell lived with his wife, who is the Philipstown Deputy Supervisor, and their four children in the picturesque town of Cold Spring in the Hudson Valley.

Jim and Nancy were married on Christmas Eve 2009. The couple had three sons together along with Mr Lovell's adult daughter from a previous marriage.

The audio technician was the youngest of four brothers who had grown up in Garrison, New York.

Mr Lovell's wife Nancy sent a message to the Today Show on Monday which was passed on to viewers by Natalie Morales.

Ms Montgomery said that her husband loved going to work with his Today show comrade, adding that she would miss his stories from his time working there.

'Jim was a great guy who would give you the shirt off his back,' Mr Shea told the paper. 'For his age, Jim was a kid. I was with him a couple of days ago. I can’t believe he is gone, leaving Nancy and his three sons behind.'

Mr Shea added that the 58-year-old writer had survived a bout with cancer and an open heart surgery five years ago.

'He loved life. What a tragedy! To be killed in a train crash,' an emotional Mr Shea said.

Lovell's son Finn has been tweeting about the tragedy since Sunday afternoon.

His latest message posted on his Twitter and Instagram accounts was a touching eulogy honoring his father.  

‘Word can't express how much my father meant to me,’ Finn Lovell wrote. ‘It's safe to say he molded me into the man I am today. I love you and I miss you.

He went on: ‘I can't believe your gone. This feels like an awful nightmare that I can't wake up from. Rest easy dad. I love you.’

In an earlier message, Finn Lovell asked his 1,431 followers to keep his father in their prayers, saying that he was in a hospital after being injured in the derailment.

Later, the young man wrote: 'I can't believe he's f****** gone. This has to be a nightmare.'

Finn followed up three hours later, tweeting in part: 'My dad may be gone but he'll never be forgotten.’

Richard Shea told the Wall Street Journal his late friend was an avid historian who was writing a book about the military history of the area in upstate New York where he grew up.

When he was not busy working on theatrical productions or digging into the past of his hometown, Mr Shea said the 58-year-old husband and father dedicated much of his free time to his children.

‘They lived on the lake. I was watching him do backflips off the diving board with his boys, hiking with his boys, doing whatever they wanted. He was one of the boys,’ Shea said.

Three
 of the four confirmed dead - two men and two women - were thrown from 
the train on impact and there are fears that more bodies are yet to be found.
