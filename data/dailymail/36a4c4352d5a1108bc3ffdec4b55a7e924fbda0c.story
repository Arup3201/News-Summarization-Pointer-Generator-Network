Donald Trump called the U.S. a 'laughingstock' on Saturday and said Republicans better find a strong presidential candidate or they will face certain defeat in the 2016 election.

In a speech to the Family Leadership Summit, a gathering of Christian conservatives in Iowa, Trump warned that Hillary Clinton will be 'really tough' to beat if she runs for president in 2016. 

'It’s going to be in my opinion a tougher race than the last race,' he said, according to the Des Moines Register. 'Really tough. And somebody’s going to have to emerge who’s really strong. … The Republicans have to do what’s right. If they don’t pick the right person – it’s got to be the perfect person – they are going to get drubbed in the 2016 election.'

He also warned against immigration reform, saying it could be a 'death wish' for the party. 

'Do what’s right, but be very careful,' he said.

In an interview with NBC News following his remarks, Trump summed up his views on the U.S. saying, 'We used to be the king and the queen all put together, and now we're a laughingstock as a country.'

He declined to say whether he's planning to run for president in 2016, though he offered up his opinion on why he would be a good candidate. 

'I've built a tremendous company - I've built a net worth that is a fantastic net worth. I have very little debt, I have tremendous cash,' he said. 'We have to create tremendous wealth so we can take care of Social Security and Medicare and all of the things that we can't afford right now. And I think I'd be very very good at doing that.'

On ABC's 'This Week' on Sunday, he elaborated on his wealth, estimating that he's worth about $10 billion. 

'If I made a decision [to run], I’d spend a lot,' he said. 'If I did it, I’d spend whatever it took.'

He also signaled that he's not done raising questions about President Obama's birth certificate.

'Some people say that was not his birth certificate. I’m saying I don’t know,' Trump said. 'Nobody knows. And you don’t know either, Jonathan. You’re a smart guy, and you don’t know.'

Trump was addressing interviewer Jonathon Karl, who responded that he is 'pretty sure' Obama's birth certificate is legitimate.
