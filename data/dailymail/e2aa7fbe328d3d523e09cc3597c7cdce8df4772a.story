'Right to die' campaigners will use Brittany Maynard as a 'poster girl' for a worldwide push for 'right to die' laws.

A video of the 29-year-old explaining why she was making use of legislation allowing 'death with dignity' in Oregon has now been watched by more than 15 million people on YouTube.

The success of the video, filmed just days before her death earlier this month, has been seized on by the charity Compassion & Choices, which backed her decision to travel to Oregon to die, and who now plan to use it to push their pro-assisted death message worldwide.

Tearful: Brittany wept in a video days before she passed away in Portland, Oregon, surrounded by her family. it has now been viewed more than 50 million times, prompting assisted dyingadvocates to describe it as a call to action

Diagnosis: Brittany Maynard, who had a form of brain cancer, had been given just six months to live in April and decided to move to Oregon so she could die at a time of her own choosing 

Grief-stricken husband: Dan Diaz (pictured during an interview with People.com) described his late wife as 'beautiful'

The newlywed took her own life on Saturday, November 1, after celebrating her husband's birthday on October 1.

Maynard, 29, who was originally from California, had moved to Portland, Oregon, after being diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma, because she wanted to control the timing and manner of her own death. 

Ms Maynard was diagnosed in January with stage IV glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer. In April, doctors gave her just six months to live.

She hit headlines around the world and became the face of the right-to-die movement after revealing her plans to end her own life this month under Oregon's Death with Dignity Act.

She passed away in the arms of her husband, Dan Diaz, and surrounded by friends and family in her home in Portland

Barbara Coombs Lee, president of Compassion & Choices, who helped draw up the state's Death With Dignity Act said she wanted people around the world to follow the Oregon's example.

'So many people across the world share broken hearts now because they came to admire Brittany Maynard and get close to her,' she told MailOnline.

‘People who are grieving want to turn to action so I think there are millions and millions of people throughout the world who are looking for a way to make a difference.

‘They are looking for a way to do what Brittany Maynard asked them to do and she asked them to do she asked them to do three things.

‘Number one: love life; number two: love each other; and number three: make end of life choice available.

‘That’s the way to honor Brittany Maynard’s family and I think people all over the world will be looking for ways to do that and Compassion & Choices will be urging them to do that.

‘We are urging them to turn their sadness into action and actually change the laws wherever they live.’

Tribute: Brittany Maynard's mother Debbie Ziegler (pictured) described how her daughter would cartwheel for hours on end until she could do it perfectly. It was a sign of the love and effort she put into everything, she said

Love: She respected Brittany's decision to take her own life, saying it was her job to 'love her through it'

Memories: The couple shared one of the last items on Brittany's bucket list - a trip to the Grand Canyon

However Maynard's advocacy of assisted dying has sparked controversy.

It was condemned by a senior Vatican official who said there is 'no dignity' in assisted dying.

Monsignor Ignacio Carrasco de Paula, head of the Pontifical Academy for Life, made the remarks last week, just two days after Miss Maynard, 29, took a lethal prescription of drugs at her Oregon home.

Speaking to Italian news agency Ansa, he said: 'This woman (took her own life) thinking she would die with dignity, but this is the error. Suicide is not a good thing.

However Coombe Lee believes that the impact of the story of her death around the world will be to encourage right-to-die legislation.

Currently very few countries have such legislation, They include the Netherlands and Switzerland and in the United States it is limited to the states of Oregon, Washington and Vermont.

However attempts to introduce it are currently under way in many other countries. In Britain Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the former Labour lord chancellor, is attempting to see legislation through the House of Lords. 

Connection: Mr Diaz and Ms Maynard are seen on their wedding day at Beltane Ranch, California, in 2012

Advocate: Barbara Coombs Lee of Compassion & Choices believes that Britanny Maynard's story will encourage people to lobby for right-to-die legislation worldwide

She added, ‘Tens of millions of people have read Brittany’s story.

‘When this many people put their hearts into a cause - officials notice and we’re barraged with requests to respond to Brittany laws.’ 

Coombs Lee said: 'Movements for human rights and dignity gather strength with aching, frustrating slowness … until the day everything changes … until some compelling event finally turns the tide toward justice.

'For the death-with-dignity movement, that event is Brittany Maynard’s life and death.'

She added: 'Make no mistake: Brittany was a brilliant, loving, vibrant, adventuresome young woman. She drank nature’s beauty and grandeur in big gulps. 

'Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love. 

Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me … but would have taken so much more.

The world is a beautiful place, travel has been my greatest teacher, my close friends and folks are the greatest givers.

I even have a ring of support around my bed as I type … 

Goodbye world. Spread good energy. Pay it forward!'

'She was deeply committed to being fully present every moment she was alive, appreciating the treasure and wonder of life.

But she was a realist, too. She’s was comforted to have medication that, if she chose to take it, would bring a peaceful, rapid death. 

'She didn’t take this medication prematurely. In fact, she had it in her possession for months. She took it only when the cruel cancer swelling her brain and crushing it against her skull made living in her body intolerable.' 

At the end of last month, Ms Maynard, who married Mr Diaz at Beltane Ranch, California in 2012, managed to tick off the last item on her bucket list: a visit to the Grand Canyon.

She revealed on her website that she had managed to travel from her home in Oregon to Arizona with her husband, mother and stepfather 'thanks to the kindness of Americans around the country who came forward to make my 'bucket list' dream come true'.

Last week Mr Diaz was revealed to have described Ms Maynard as a 'beautiful person on the inside' with a 'personality you really get attracted to' just weeks before her death.

Talking to People.com in October, the 43-year-old spoke of when they first met, saying at first glance she was beautiful, but as they grew closer he realized she was also stunning on the inside.

'For me it was meeting the person I fell in love with and that was Brittany. Jokingly, she would say I'd certainly been single long enough because there was an age difference between us,' he said. 

Debbie Ziegler, 56, Brittany's mother also paid tribute to her late daughter.

She described everything from cartwheels as a child to volunteering in Nepalese orphanages that made her only child 'smart', 'charismatic', and 'driven'.

Oregon voters approved the Death with Dignity Act in 1994, but opponents persuaded a federal judge to issue an injunction temporarily blocking the law. Voters in November 1997 overwhelmingly reaffirmed the nation's first aid-in-dying law and it's been in place ever since.

According to state statistics compiled through Dec. 31, 2013:

— People who have used the law since late 1997: 752 (396 men, 356 women)

— People younger than 35 who have used the law: 6

— Median age of the deceased: 71

— Percentage of the deceased who were white: 97

— Percentage who had at least some college: 72

— Percentage of patients who informed relatives of their decision: 94

— Percentage of patients who died at a home: 95 percent

— Median minutes between ingestion of lethal drug and unconsciousness: 5

— Median minutes between ingestion and death: 25

— Number of terminally ill people who have moved to Oregon to die: unknown
