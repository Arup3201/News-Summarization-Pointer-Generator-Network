Britain's most pernicious invasive plant, Japanese knotweed, may have finally met its match in a two millimetre-long insect

It has plagued gardeners for decades and affected thousands of house sales because of its ability to grow more than 9ft in just ten weeks.

But Britain's most pernicious invasive plant, Japanese knotweed, may have finally met its match in a two millimetre-long insect.

Research on Aphalara itadori, a psyllid or plant louse similar to aphids, has established that it inhibits the growth of the knotweed and poses no risk to native species, including the plant's close relative rhubarb.

Scientists at CABI, formerly Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux International, announced that they have also succeeded in getting the insect to survive through British winters.

Dr Kate Constantine, from CABI, said: 'The results confirmed the psyllid to be a high-specialised natural enemy of Japanese knotweed. The challenge now is to get the psyllid to establish in the natural environment which, as for any programme of this type, isn't easy.'

Tens of thousands of specially bred lice were placed on knotweed at eight locations in England and Wales as part of the research.

This was the first time the release of an alien insect species had been authorised in the European Union.

The study found the insect would feed on the sap of the knotweed, inhibiting its growth - but it failed to breed on any of 90 other native British species, meaning that they would face no threat from the insect.

Scientists say the number of colonies that have successfully over-wintered remains too small to be certain that the bug could widely establish itself in Britain.

But if it does, they believe the bug will allow natural order to slowly reassert itself and knotweed could eventually be seen as just a 'mild nuisance'.

Writing in The Ecologist, Dr  Constantine said: 'A more natural equilibrium is restored. Biological control doesn't aim to eradicate the target plant, but rather to reduce its vigour and invasiveness. Keeping the invasive plant in check ideally allows native plants to re-establish and flourish.'

Elizabeth Abraham's house lost half its value because Japanese knotweed started taking over the back garden

The Government last year faced calls to do more to tackle the invader following reports that banks were refusing to offer mortgages on properties affected by knotweed.

Homeowners faced bills of up to £20,000 to remove the prolific foreign invader before they could sell. 

Earlier this year, Elizabeth Abraham's house lost  half its value because Japanese knotweed started taking over the back garden. 

The 91-year-old was told the house in Swansea, which was expected to be valued at £80,000, will not sell for more than £45,000 because of the untamed wild weed.

The destructive bamboo-like plant has flourished across the country and the Government estimates it would take £1.5billion to clear the infestation.

It can grow more than 9ft in just ten weeks, and easily spreads from neighbouring homes, wasteland, waterways, railway lines or footpaths.

Its extensive deep roots can penetrate roads, concrete, damage foundations and drains. 

Japanese knotweed - which has the scientific name fallopia japonica - was introduced into Britain by the Victorians.

Incredibly invasive, it can grow four inches (ten centimetres) in a day from April to October and a tiny root can establish itself as a plant in just ten days.

Apparently solid structures such as tarmac and flooring in houses are no barrier to its growth and the weed also creates a risk of flooding if leaves clog waterways.

Knotweed is recognised by its shovel-shaped leaves, bamboo-like stem and white flowers produced in autumn.
