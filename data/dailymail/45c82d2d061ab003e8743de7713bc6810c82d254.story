Luke Shaw showed he is not afraid of the winter cold as he took the plunge in a post-training ice bath.

The Manchester United defender posted a picture to his Instagram account on Thursday afternoon whilst taking a dip in the freezing water.

He wrote: 'Ice bath after a tough training session preparing for Saturday's game!! Let's get back on the winning run #MUFC'.

Manchester United star Luke Shaw gives a thumbs up as he takes an after training dip in an ice bath

The 19-year-old has played only ten times in the Premier League for United since moving to Old Trafford

The defender has struggled for a first team place since his £31.5million move from Southampton 

The Manchester United youngster has made just 10 Premier League appearances since his £31.5million summer move from Southampton, after twisting his ankle against Arsenal in November.

Shaw has yet to complete a full 90 minutes for the Red Devils since his return to action against Tottenham at the end of 2014, having played a total of just 144 minutes in the Premier League.

His side will be looking for a return to winning ways against QPR on Saturday, having won just one of their last five games in the English top flight.
