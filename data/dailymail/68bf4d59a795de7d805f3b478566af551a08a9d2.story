Janet Tyler, pictured with son Joseph when he was a few months old, claims football star Sol Campbell hasn't seen their son for six and a half years

An ex-girlfriend of former England football star Sol Campbell claims he shows ‘prejudice’ every day because he won’t see their nine-year-old son.

Janet Tyler said she feels sorry for the former Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur football star because he’s missing out on spending time with young Joseph and urged him to ‘ring or visit’ their son.

Mr Campbell caused controversy with the revelation he believed he was overlooked for the England captaincy because of racial prejudice within the FA.

Now Ms Tyler has reacted to his comments by making comparisons to the former player's relationship with his estranged son.

‘I feel sorry for him, that’s my biggest emotion. I feel sorry for him that he denies himself the unconditional love that he could have,’ she told BBC Radio 5 Live.

However, the footballer, who said in interviews about his new book that it might take him 10 or 20 years to see his son because there’s a lot of ‘anguish and anger’, hit back at the claims.

The 39-year-old said: ‘There are two sides to every story. It’s a private thing.’

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said he had only written one line about his son in his biography because it was a ‘private matter’.

He said: ‘It has gone beyond the book now. It is quite disappointing because in the book it only says a few things and this is putting too much on something and giving air-time to someone who is nothing really.

‘It is up to her if she wants to put something on the radio and ring them up and talk to them over the phone.’

Ms Tyler had told BBC Radio Five Live that her son felt ‘the odd one out’ compared to Mr Campbell's other two children.

She said: ‘I can’t believe he doesn’t think about Joseph. The fact he has two other children now, surely that taps into him or his feelings

‘He talks about racial discrimination and I think he practices prejudice every single day because he’s decided which two children are worthy of his love and time and he has another child which isn’t and that to me is the worst kind of prejudice.

Footballer Sol Campbell, 39, said in interviews about his new book that he might not see son Joseph for 10 or 20 years because there was a lot of 'anger and anguish'

‘His children’s charity that he does – it’s commendable, fantastic – but it’s hard for Joseph.

‘You’ve got a little boy at home who you don’t bother with and how does he feel when he sees you’re taking strangers somewhere and you’re going on about great you are doing it but yet your own flesh and blood doesn’t have any of those opportunities.’

Ms Tyler also said the football ace hasn’t seen Joseph, who was born in 2004 - two years after the pair met in a restaurant – for six and a half years.

She said: ‘He lives 25 miles away from you. He doesn’t live on the other side of the world. You can come and see him, you can ring him up, you can send him a Christmas card.

‘Life is short, time is precious. You will never get these years back. The longer you leave it the harder it’ll be to have a relationship.

Janet Tyler, pictured with Joseph when he was a baby, said she wants Sol Campbell to be in their son's life. She said: 'Children need their fathers in their life. He needs him now. If he spent time with Joseph he'd be so proud'

‘Children need their fathers in their life. He needs him now.

‘I want him to see Joseph. I want him to be proud. If he spent time with Joseph he’d be so proud.’

Earlier this month, it emerged Mr Campbell had written in his new authorised biography that he would’ve been England captain if he was white.

In the book, which is due to be released later this month, he said: ‘I believe if I was white I would’ve been England captain for more than 10 years. It’s as simple as that.

‘I think the FA wished I was white. I had the credibility, performance-wise, to be captain. I was consistently in the heart of the defence and I was club captain early on in my career. I don’t think it will change because they don’t want it to.’
