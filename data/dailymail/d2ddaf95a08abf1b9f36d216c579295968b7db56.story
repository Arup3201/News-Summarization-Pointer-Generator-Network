Some would brand it decline, some would argue it's just transition. It's the process taking FC Barcelona from the middle of their first season under the late Tito Vilanova (August-December 2012) when their football showed absolutely no deterioration from the Pep Guardiola era until January 4, 2015 and a humiliating defeat to David Moyes' Real Sociedad.

When you are in the middle of what was often a maelstrom, either as a player, coach, director, fan or writer, it can be hard to accurately chart the causes and cures.

Events? No problem. They are chronicled one after the other.

But patterns? Reasons? Solutions? It's not simple to get right.

One of the symptoms of Barcelona patently going through either decline or adaptation, even reinvention if you want, has been a loss of personality.

For a long time Guardiola's teams were as spiky, belligerent, dynamic and confident away from home as they were at the Nou Camp.

Then, suddenly, they weren't. There was a hint of it in Guardiola's final weeks when his world and European champions lost away to Getafe, Osasuna and Chelsea (in a game they should have won at least 4-1).

Champions League football, often played without a safety net, long since a place where the top teams carry identical win expectations away from home, is where this loss of muscular mentality showed most.

Since Barcelona were last within a millimetre of the Champions League Final — on that mad evening of April 24, 2012 (2-1 up on aggregate to 10-man Chelsea and then 2-2 but with a penalty) — until this week's tie in Manchester against City, they have suffered some painful and humiliating reverses on the road.

From then until now the Catalans have lost away to Chelsea, Celtic, Milan, Bayern, Ajax, Atletico and PSG, and have drawn at Milan (twice) and PSG.

Despite the fact that Tata Martino's Barcelona won 2-0 at the City of Manchester stadium at this stage last year, you could ally that really horrible drop in away form with the club's historic record of playing in England (lost 14 and drawn eight of 29 visits) and suggest that the Premier League champions need to be regarded as decent favourites on Tuesday.

However, La Liga's second-placed side, who surprisingly went down 1-0 at home to Malaga on Saturday, have largely shed their chrysalis form and become butterflies.

Despite the fact their worst humiliations this season have almost all come away from home — Real Madrid, Málaga, Real Sociedad in particular — Luis Enrique's side were thrilling in winning at Ajax and APOEL and it was then that confidence was sparking and Luis Suárez was beginning his process of reshaping how this team attacks.

Since losing in San Sebastian in January, the Blaugrana have scored 22 away goals while winning, with brutal authority, at Atlético, Bilbao, Elche, and La Coruña.

This week Lionel Messi concluded: 'From that day onwards we've changed our approach totally. We are hungrier, we go out with a different attitude, we attack better, we press better.'

Luis Enrique, who doesn't see football in quite the same manner as his superstar, disagreed. In fact he wasn't pleased with the idea, insisting: 'All we are seeing is the normal process of a team's evolution during a season. I continue to insist that we are doing the same things now as we were before.'

But they are both right. The coach's ideas have found their maturity — daily work, which is intense, disciplined, and aimed at making the team play with less midfield filigree, has made the team tough and confident.

An identity is emerging. Luis Suárez is having something of a Henrik Larsson impact.

Luis Suarez is helping change Barca's identity and is forming a deadly partnership with Messi and Neymar

Having taken a little time to adapt to not being the perpetual dominant striker reference point, and to adapt to their goal flows dropping (which is also what happened when the Swede arrived in Barcelona in 2004), their football intelligence has cascaded out.

Just as it's easy, but short-sighted, to point out that the Uruguayan is scoring less freely than at Liverpool, it's easy — and one-dimensional — to add that his goal-assist flow is absolutely stellar.

The superb 'extra' is his movement, his awareness of fellow strikers Neymar and Messi and the fabulous way in which he'll either harass defenders into mistakes or make runs in such a way that space is created for the Brazilian and Argentinian to raise havoc.

Although Suarez hasn't been as prolific for his new side, he's been the perfect foil for his striker partners 

Given how dangerous, mobile and smart these three brilliant technicians are, given that the Xavi era has now gone, it has made sense for Enrique to retouch the Barcelona identity.

City will face a team which, just as Martino tried to evolve them, is now happier to move up the pitch in shorter amounts of time using far fewer passes.

Instead of pulling teams this way and that, the boxing equivalent of wearing them down with dozens of jabs to the torso, they now unleash flurries of quick, 'knockout' punches. Aimed at the head.

According to what Manuel Pellegrini told the elegant Spanish writer Santi Segurola this week, that should make for a fine old spectacle.

City's Chilean commandante promised: 'Last year our tactic was to try to 'contain' Barcelona at our stadium, to shackle them, because the away goal is almost always a crucial factor in Champions League knockout football.

Manchester City no longer fear Barcelona and will take the game to them at the Camp Nou this time

'But this year we'll 'go for the game' right from the outset — albeit with due respect to Barcelona's quality.'

Pellegrini also conceded that his process of establishing a City 'identity' has faltered — in the opposite way to Barcelona's recent problems.

'We've 'lost' our season at home,' he admitted. 'Newcastle put us out of the League Cup, Middlesbrough out of the FA Cup and in the title race we've lost the seven points which Chelsea has as an advantage to Stoke, Hull City and Burnley.

'The same in Europe. We give away home advantage too often.'

Champions League music to Barcelona's ears. City face a team which, at last, loves life on the road.

Sergio Aguero will be the man Barcelona will need to watch when the two side meet in the Champions League
