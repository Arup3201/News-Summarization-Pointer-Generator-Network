A theater critic is unrepentant after he quite literally took the law into his own hands and smashed the cellphone of another patron who refused to stop using it during a performance on Wednesday night.

Kevin Williamson, a writer for the National Review, was attending a performance of 'Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812,' described as an ‘electro-pop opera’ based on ‘War and Peace’ and playing in New York at Kazino, a temporary structure beside The Standard Hotel.

Writing about the incident on the National Review’s website, Williamson said he recommended the show but thought the audience ‘horrible - talking, using their phones.’

‘It was bad enough that I seriously considered leaving during the intermission, something I’ve not done before,’ he wrote. 

The audience at the performance were sitting in groups at small tables and each table was explicitly told that photography and cell phone use was strictly prohibited during the performance.

According to Williamson the people seated around him failed to comply with this simple request.

‘The main offenders were two parties of women of a certain age, the sad sort with too much makeup and too-high heels, and insufficient attention span for following a two-hour musical,' he wrote.

'But my date spoke with the theater management during the intermission, and they apologetically assured us that the situation would be remedied.’

Unfortunately the situation didn’t improve after the interval and so Williamson asked the woman sitting to his right to refrain from using her phone to access the internet.

‘I asked her to turn it off. She answered: “So don’t look.” I asked her whether I had missed something during the very pointed announcements to please turn off your phones, perhaps a special exemption granted for her. She suggested that I should mind my own business,’ wrote Williamson, who has a theater column in the New Criterion.

Angered by the woman’s disregard for the rules of the establishment, Williamson instinctively did something that many people may have fantasized about doing at one stage or another and threw the woman’s phone unto the floor and away from her.

Asked afterwards if the phone was damaged, Williamson told Gothamist: ‘It had to be; I threw it a pretty good distance.’

The woman slapped Williamson and then after failing to find her phone stormed off to complain to the management.

Not long afterwards Williamson received a visit from the show's security director who asked him to step into the lobby to ‘have a word.’

'They tried to keep me there. He said the lady was talking about filing charges. So I waited around for a bit, but it seemed to be taking a while,' he told Gothamist.

In the end he says he got bored of waiting and so left.

'In a civilized world, I would have 
received a commendation of some sort. To the theater-going public of New
York — nay, the the world – I say: "You’re welcome,"' he wrote in the 
National Review.

Williamson has said he is willing to face the cell phone user in court should she decide to press charges, but in future perhaps she might think twice about using it in the theater.

Kevin Williamson lost it when the lady beside him refused to stop using her phone - even after he asked her politely to do so
