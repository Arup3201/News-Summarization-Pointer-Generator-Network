A stark warning that banks across the European Union need to reduce the size of their debts by an astonishing £1trillion was issued by the International Monetary Fund today.

It called on banks across Europe to reduce the reliance on emergency wholesale funds provided by central bank and to rebuild their balance sheet.

The failure of European banks to reform is ‘blocking economic recovery’ and starving small and medium sized businesses of vital funds they need to survive.

IMF official Jose Vinals was critical of banks in the eurozone which he said were too dependent

Whereas as the United States and Britain moved speedily to reshape their banking systems post the financial crisis the Europeans have been slow to act applying sticking plasters in the shape of emergency cash arrangements provided by the European Central Bank.  

IMF officials cited Britain as the one country where the reform of the banks was well advanced.

It expressed concern, however, that stalled progress in restoring the health of the state controlled banks – Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland – is a drag on the recovery of the British economy.

Commenting on its Global Financial Stability Report a top IMF official Jose Vinals said he detected ‘blue skies’ in the global financial system some five years after the financial crash. 

But while he gave the Americans, the Britain and Japan praise for tackling the issues he was critical of the eurozone for failing to deal with ‘legacy’ issues of the debt build up and strengthening the balance sheets of its banks. 

He accused banks in the eurozone of having become ‘too dependent’ on the wholesale funds some of which have been provided under guarantee by the European Central Bank. 

The IMF pressed the case for ‘decisive’ action in Europe if there was to be recovery and this included the establishment of a ‘fully fledged banking union.’

‘We do not yet have healthy banks,’ the IMF’s top financial analyst said.

Although eurozone leaders have pledged themselves to banking union precious little action has been taken as markets have calmed down. Progress also has been halted by the upcoming German elections, the political stalemate in Italy and the worsening shape of the French economy.

The Fund officials expressed strong fears that recovery among Europe’s weakest economies, Greece, Spain and Portugal, was being held up by the appalling state of the banking system. ‘Credit is not flowing in the euro area periphery,’ Vinals said.

The IMF also expressed concerns that even though the legacy issues of the ‘great recession’ had not yet even though legacy issues of the great recession have not fully been dealt with there are new crises on the horizon.

Vinals gave his support to the contentious Cyprus rescue package noting that it was important in bank crises, post the crash, that private holders of bank debts – in Cyprus’s case the large depositors – paid a price as well as the taxpayers.

He described the situation in Cyprus as being unique to that country. 

The Fund expressed concern that now that the banking crisis is all but over in the United States, where it began with the sub-prime meltdown in 2007-2008, that it was already returning to bad habits.

Companies and private equity firms were rushing to raise cheap debt for takeovers without making the proper checks or putting in the right safeguards.

The IMF is worried that ‘pension funds and insurance companies’ are taking excessive risks. 

Similarly, the money being printed in the US, Britain and other advances countries is ‘spilling over into emerging markets’ exposing fast growing economies to currency risks and rising debt.

This has raised the prospect of volatile capital flows that in turn could lead to currency wars.
