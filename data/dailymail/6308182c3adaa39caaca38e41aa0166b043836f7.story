A 3D reconstruction of a tooth: By measuring the relative amounts of barium and calcium on a tooth's growth lines, shown here in colours, scientists showed that a Neanderthal infant probably switched to a solid diet after around 14 months

Neanderthals breastfed their babies for over a year - just like humans, according to new research.

Chemical analysis of a juvenile's tooth reveal it was reared on mother's milk for seven months with suckling continuing for the same period coupled with solid food.

The change from breastfeeding to 
plants and grains can be established by looking at differences in the 
distribution of barium in teeth enamel.

This
 enabled Dr Manish Arora and colleagues at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York to discover the early life diet 
of a 10-12 year-old child that lived in a cave in Belgium around 100,000
 years ago.

Weaning is critical to developmental and reproductive rates.

Later
 weaning can have health benefits while doing it earlier leads to 
shorter intervals between births which influences population growth, 
evolution and success.

The change from breastfeeding to 
plants and grains can be established by looking at differences in the 
distribution of barium in teeth enamel.

The researchers said our understanding of the evolution of human weaning has been limited by a lack of reliable markers to indicate the timing and nature of dietary transitions.

Barium distributions in tooth enamel accurately reflect dietary transitions from the introduction of mother's milk through to feeding with other food sources, the team said.

Experiments on humans and macaques revealed barium rises during breastfeeding and drops abruptly on weaning.

The study of a molar tooth of the Neanderthal child uncovered barium levels indicating it was breastfed exclusively for seven months followed by seven months of supplementation after which breastfeeding was ceased.

Barium levels in the teeth of this Neandertal child suggest that it was partly weaned at 227 days after birth and entirely weaned at 435 days

Barium is calcium's cousin, and it goes where calcium goes in the body.

Over the years, it accumulates in our bones.

When a mother begins nursing, some of that barium migrates into her breast milk, and eventually, into her baby's teeth.

This allowed the team to track when mothers stopped breastfeeding.

Dr Arora, assistant professor of dentistry at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, said: 'Here we show large dietary shifts in early life manifest as compositional variations in dental tissues.

'Teeth from human children and captive macaques, with prospectively recorded diet histories, demonstrate barium distributions accurately reflect dietary transitions from the introduction of mother's milk through the weaning process.

'We also document dietary transitions in a Middle Palaeolithic juvenile Neanderthal, which shows a pattern of exclusive breastfeeding for seven months, followed by seven months of supplementation.

'After this point barium levels in enamel returned to baseline prenatal levels, indicating an abrupt cessation of breastfeeding at 1.2 years of age.'

Neanderthals lived during the last Ice Age and would have had to have coped with extremely harsh environments.

While blizzards raged outside the parents would have to track down something to eat, prepare it and keep the fires going.

Examination of Neanderthal burial sites and caves have led researchers to conclude they were not 'savages' but lived in small nuclear families.

There was also some amount of social networking including interaction between family or neighbouring groups.

And they went well beyond their capacity to fend for themselves meaning they took care of their elderly and sick - as well as their children.

They grieved at the loss of an infant or elder by burying their dead.

It is also believed they were able to produce speech and may even have been responsible for some of the most ancient cave art on the planet.

Dr Arora said: 'In the Neanderthal the protracted weaning process typical in primates was interrupted by unknown causes precipitating abrupt cessation of suckling.

'The period of exclusive breastfeeding in this Neanderthal is consistent with other hominoids; human hunter-gatherers and wild chimpanzees also begin to supplement milk with solid food by around 6 months of age.

'Humans and chimpanzees may wean offspring as early as 1.0 and 4.2 years, respectively, withoutserious health effects, but average 2.3-2.6 years and 5.3 years.'

He said the study will help further studies into theories Neanderthal young routinely weaned at later ages than later early humans or possessed faster life histories than modern man which have important implications for models of population growth and species replacement.
