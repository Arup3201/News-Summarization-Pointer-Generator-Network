TV funnyman Justin Lee Collins has been accused of harassing his ex-girlfriend over a six-month period.

Collins denies the alleged harassment and entered a plea of not guilty when he appeared at St Albans Magistrates' Court today.

He will now face a jury trial over the allegations after asking to be tried at a Crown Court.

The shaggy-haired comedian, 37, is accused of causing Anna Larke 'fear of violence' when the pair dated between January and July this year. 

If convicted the presenter, who is currently appearing in West End show Rock of Ages, could face up to six months behind bars.

When asked if he wanted his case to be heard by magistrates or at a Crown Court, he politely replied, 'Crown Court please.'

This means that a judge and jury will decide the outcome of the case. 

He will now attend a further pre-trial hearing at the magistrates' court on 17 February 2012, when he will be given a date to appear at a Crown Court.

The Bristolian comic arrived at court wearing jeans and trainers with a checked shirt and tie.

He was not required to stand in the dock, and instead stood next to his solicitor during the brief hearing in Hertfordshire.

Reading out the charge against him, 
chair of the magistrates' bench, Doreen Clapper, said: 'It is alleged 
that between January 2011 and July 2011 you caused Anna Larke to fear 
that violence would be used against her by your course of action which 
you knew or ought to have known would cause fear of violence to her on 
each occasion that you made threats of violence towards her.'

Collins was released on bail and ordered not to contact Ms Larke or her relatives.

When the charges were initially bought against him, a spokeswoman for the star said: 'He is shocked and upset by the allegations.

'He is unable to comment on the circumstances and the events to which the charge relates because of the proceedings, but he is confident that he will prove his innocence.'

Collins refused to comment as he left court.
