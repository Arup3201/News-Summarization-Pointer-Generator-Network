Arrest: Reggie Hardy allegedly punched a man and cut off his dreadlocks after finding him in his home

A father punched a 19-year-old in the face and chopped off his dreadlocks after he found him sneaking around his apartment with his teenage daughter, police have said.

Reginald Hardy has said he is sorry for attacking the unnamed man after he found him inside his Reading, Pennsylvania home on Friday night.

Hardy, whose daughter only moved in with him a few weeks ago, said he saw people running through his apartment and into his bathroom.

'Then we got into a little scuffle,' he told WFMZ.

Court documents reveal Hardy punched the teenager in the face, grabbed him by the hair and dragged him into the kitchen, where he sliced off his dreadlocks with a knife.

As the man attempted to leave, Hardy told him not to run because he had a gun and would shoot him in the back, according to documents.

'That might have been the maddest I ever got because I literally just seen red,' he said.

After the attack, he was charged with aggravated assault, terroristic threats and other offenses.

Police say Hardy cooperated with the investigation. He's free on $50,000 unsecured bail and is due in court for a preliminary hearing on January 12.

He apologized to the young man for attacking him but said he hopes the teenager, whom he said was disrespectful, will also apologize to him.

'He knows he shouldn't have been there,' he said. 'I'm a father looking out for my daughter. That's it.' 

Some of his neighbors at the Franklin Manor Apartments told WFMZ that they sympathized with the father's actions.

'I think he has the right to do it because a father needs to protect his daughters,' said neighbor Jo Boltz.
