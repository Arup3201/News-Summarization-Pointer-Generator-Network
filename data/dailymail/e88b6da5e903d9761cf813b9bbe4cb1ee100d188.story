Drivers could be banned from getting behind the wheel after just a single pint under tough new rules proposed by MPs.

The All Parliamentary Group on Alcohol Misuse called for a tightening on drink drive rules as part of a raft of measures to combat problem drinking.

Members also called for cigarette-style health warnings on wine bottles, a minimum price per unit of alcohol and a strengthening of the rules around advertising alchoholic products.

Crackdown: New rules proposed by MPs would ban motorists from driving after a single pint of strong lager

'The facts and figures of the scale of alcohol misuse in the UK speak for themselves,' said Tracey Crouch, Tory MP and chairman of the group.

'1.2 million people a year are admitted to hospital due to alcohol; liver disease in those under 30 has more than doubled over the past 20 years; and the cost of alcohol to the economy totals £21 billion.'

The group has called on political parties to commit to 10 recommendations which they say will help to minimise alcohol-related harm in the UK.

Chief among them is a reduction in the drink-drive limit from 80 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood to 50mg per 100ml, the Sunday Express reported.

So defined, the law would criminalise driving after a single pint of strong lager or a large glass of wine. Younger drivers under the age of 21 would be targeted first.

Ms Crouch told Sunday Express health editor Lucy Johnston: 'We have one of the highest alcohol driving limits in the world.

'We have seen drink-driving accidents increase over the past two years and we want to start by targeting younger drivers who are more likely to be involved in a fatal collision than older drivers.'

The group also wants to see health warnings and more detailed nutritional labelling on alcohol products.

The recommendation document states: 'Health warnings are a familiar and prominent feature on all tobacco products. Likewise, detailed nutritional labelling is ubiquitous on food products and soft drinks.

'Yet consumer information on alcohol products usually extends no further than the volume strength and unit content.

'In order to inform consumers about balanced risk, every alcohol label should include an evidence-based health warning as well as describing the product's nutritional calorific and alcohol content.'

Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, vice-chairman of the group, said: 'After smoking, alcohol is the second biggest preventable killer.

'Not only does it cost lives but burdens the NHS and the criminal and justice systems and others with ever increasing costs.

'All the political parties know that but they run for cover when they are confronted by the drinks industry and its immensely powerful lobby.

'These proposals give them another chance to consider whether they really have the guts to take a different line for the country's wellbeing in the future.'

Jackie Ballard, chief executive of Alcohol Concern, added: 'We need urgent action to tackle this and the significant harmful effects alcohol misuse causes to individuals.

'I hope all parties will read the manifesto and show a commitment to the vital measures which it highlights.'

Under current law, the UK has one of the highest drink-drive limits in Europe. Most countries set the limit at either 0.5mg per ml of blood, the level proposed for under-21s by the latest report. But in a significant chunk of the continent, the limit is just 0.2mg - equivalent to a very small tipple indeed.
