Does everything appeal to you about getting married, apart from the bit where you tie the knot?  

If so, you're in luck. A Japanese tour operator is  giving wannabe brides the chance to create their  perfect Japanese or white wedding by providing a dress, flowers and photographs - without the need for a groom.

Cerca Travel is offering the two-day solo bridal package in the  city of Kyoto in Japan. 

A photographer will be on-hand throughout the morning to capture all the special moments

Their website suggests it might be a service to consider 'if you are are single and you don't know if you would be able to get married' - and that it's a worthwhile opportunity to put on a wedding dress and have your picture taken 'when you are young and beautiful'.

Prices start at £1,706 and include a personal consultation for guests to decide between the traditional Japanese gown or a white wedding dress and bouquet arrangement.

You'll then visit a specialist bridal shop to select your favourite dress or kimono. Day two begins with a hair and make-up appointment before the fitting of the gown.

Day two begins with a hair and make-up appointment before the fitting of the gown 

A photographer will be on-hand throughout the morning to capture all the special moments as you move between the salon and the Japanese garden of Shugakuin Kirara Sanso for the official photo shoot. 

The deal includes one night in a hotel, a mini photo album and USB stick to take home with you to remind you of the  day.

Added extras - should you need them - are a Japanese groom, extra flowers, spa treatment or a partner to have dinner with  to quell the nerves of the night before.

Kyoto, two hours south of Tokyo by bullet train, has been named the World’s Best City in the Travel and Leisure Awards 2014. 

It has a diverse history and reputation as Japan’s original capital and cultural centre. 

The city is home to the Imperial Palace and is the only place where real geishas can still be seen. So, if you have some time to kill before or after the faux nuptials, there's a lot to be getting on with.
