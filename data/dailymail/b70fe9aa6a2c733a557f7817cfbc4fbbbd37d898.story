Wilson Palacios stares at the ground and rarely looks up for half an hour. Conversations about the kidnap and murder of his youngest brother are a dreadful necessity in his life.

‘Things must change,’ he says. ‘We have to deal with these gangs.’ And that is why he talks.

He speaks slowly and quietly to a translator. Across a long and painful discussion with Sportsmail, he will relive the nightmare of Edwin’s kidnapping by gangs in Honduras in 2007, the failed ransom exchange, the silence and the discovery of Edwin’s body 19 months later.

He will also reveal for the first time that this ordeal was followed by a second kidnapping, when his sister-in-law and two nephews were taken hostage for a week in 2012.

‘There was no ransom paid that time,’ he says. ‘The police were getting close and we got my sister-in-law and nephews back after a week.’

He adds: ‘It is uncomfortable to talk about but I must because I want people to understand.’

The gang situation in Honduras is critical and Palacios believes the terrible details of stories like his – awfully common in Honduras – can help spread awareness and draw support. It is why he has requested this interview and why he has joined Kenco’s campaign to lure the teenagers of his homeland away from gangs and into coffee farming.

The Honduran footballer has not only had to deal with one kidnapping - in 2012 his sister-in-law and two nephews were also taken for a fortnight

‘I lived in La Ceiba and there is a gang there – 18th Street Gang - which is very active and one of the biggest gangs in central America,’ he says.

‘A lot of my friends ended up being part of it. They ended up there because there were no opportunities for these young people. No work, or hope - nothing. It was the easiest opportunity for a lot of people.’

In the context of a UN report from this year, Honduras has by far the world’s highest murder rate and 60 per cent of their population live below the poverty line. It’s a country through which 70 per cent of the US’s cocaine passes and is home to an estimated 36,000 young gang members.

Palacios says: ‘Lots of my friends from school ended up like this. They had either been forced to join a gang or did it voluntarily because there was no other opportunity for them. A lot of them are dead now.

‘Often when friends disappeared for long periods of time, we would ask “Where is he?” It would become clear that they were in a gang or dead.

‘I had a stable, middle-class family. My father was a factory manager and my mother was a teacher. And I had football as a passion and possibility. If I didn’t it might have gone differently.’

When his brother was kidnapped, Palacios and his family paid a ransom reported to be around £330,000

The gang entered his life in October 2007, just months after the publicity of Palacios’s big opportunity in England. One of five brothers, four of whom became professional footballers, he left Honduras aged 23 for a trial at Arsenal. Then, on the back of Arsene Wenger’s endorsement, he was given a six-month trial at Birmingham.

‘My family were not particularly wealthy but because the gang perceived them to be wealthy they targeted them,’ he says. ‘It happened three months into my trial at Birmingham.’

Five gunmen broke into the family home, tied up Palacios’s parents and took Edwin, the youngest brother at 15, from his room.

‘I was training one morning and I remember very clearly,’ Palacios says. ‘I suddenly had a strange feeling in my gut.

From Wigan, Palacios moved to Tottenham for £12 million, where he stayed until August 2011

‘I went to the dressing room and turned on my phone and saw I had missed a call from my older brother. I called and he told me our brother (Edwin) had been kidnapped. He said I had to stay calm. I said I am coming home but he thought that might make it worse.

‘I stayed but a month later I couldn’t deal with it and had to leave. I asked Steve Bruce for permission and he let me. I stayed there in Honduras for three months and negotiated with the kidnappers.

‘Negotiations lasted a year. They would put my brother on the phone. It was so hard. But we paid the ransom after a year and then we heard nothing.’

The ransom is reported to have been approximately £330,000.

Palacios says: ‘My family went to a spot to pick him up – I was back in England by then. The kidnappers told us to drop the money and they would release him. We left the money but they never released him. My family waited for hours.’

In England, Palacios had followed Bruce from Birmingham to Wigan and then on to Tottenham for £12m in 2009.

‘I played on without knowing what had happened to my brother,’ he says. ‘One day the police got in touch and told us they had possibly found the body. I was about to play an important game (away at Everton) in 2009 and I had to come back to Honduras.’

The call had come at 1am on May 9 and he waited in the team hotel’s lobby for six hours until Harry Redknapp was awake to ask permission to leave. Redknapp was left speechless by the gesture.

Palacios has since rebuilt his life, naming his three-year-old son after his late brother. He revealed he went through the nightmare of a kidnapping again two years ago when his brother Jerry’s wife and their two sons were taken but released.

Palacios’s career has hit a bump, though. The 30-year-old has not appeared for Stoke since playing at the World Cup in the summer and plans to leave in January.

Palacios, now at Stoke, has struggled to find first-team football under Mark Hughes and will look to move on

‘In January I will be looking at other teams, hopefully in London,’ he says. ‘I think the team is doing well, but when the trainer (Mark Hughes) does not see eye to eye with someone it is difficult to play. I have no issues with the manager, this is just how football is sometimes.

‘There is not a lot I can do about it.’

The gang situation, or so he hopes, is a different matter. He runs his own initiatives at home and is paid no money to endorse Kenco’s campaign and relive awful memories.

‘Talking about what happened to my family is hard,’ he says. ‘But it is OK if it helps stop this problem that I know so well. Things must change.’
