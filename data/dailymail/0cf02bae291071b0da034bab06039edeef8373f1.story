The woman victim told police she was raped while out sleep-walking in Ruislip, north London (pictured posed by model)

A sleepwalker was raped when she wandered out of a friend’s home in her nightclothes after a dinner party.

Detectives are investigating the attack on the 48-year-old woman on a street in Ruislip, West London.

The victim told specialist investigators she was accosted and raped  after she decided to stay overnight following a dinner party with friends.

The woman, believed to be a child carer, suffers from the sleep disorder somnambulism and has sleepwalked at night before.

A source said she went to bed around midnight but appears to have let herself out of the house before being targeted by the attacker.

He told the London Evening Standard: ‘She suffers from somnambulism which means that she sometimes sleepwalks in the middle of the night.

‘She was at a friend’s house and apparently she went out of the house in Ruislip and walked around the streets, unaware of what she was doing.’

Officers from Scotland Yard’s Sapphire unit – set up to improve confidence among victims and catch more rapists – are investigating the offence.

They have taken DNA samples and other forensic evidence from the woman in the hope of matching it with known offenders on their databases.

They are also hunting for CCTV footage from the area around the attack, which took place at about 4am on June 27.

It is also understood that specialist rape counsellors and detectives have interviewed the victim. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that detectives were investigating ‘an allegation of sexual assault’ and that forensic investigations were ongoing.

Police have said they are investigating the rape but are not even sure where exactly the attack happened and said officers from Operation Sapphire were investigating

A spokesman said: ‘We are not prepared to give many details of this incident to protect the vulnerable victim

‘Because of the circumstances in 
which it happened, we are not even sure where the sex attack happened – 
at this stage we are just saying Ruislip.

‘We are giving very few details of 
this case because we are most anxious nothing should be published which 
might identify this woman.’

The Sapphire sex crime unit has been rocked by a series of scandals as it battles to win back the support of victims.

One detective has been accused of falsifying documents and another faces claims of misconduct over the standard of his work.

In 2001, a landlord who raped his teenage tenant after she came into his bedroom while sleepwalking was jailed for seven years.

Iranian Muslim Abbas Dadgarnejad, 
then aged 38, was branded ‘despicable’ for taking advantage of the 
19-year-old Danish girl at his flat in Central London.

The Old Bailey heard the girl had a history of sleepwalking and went to bed with her fiancé but woke up with her landlord.
