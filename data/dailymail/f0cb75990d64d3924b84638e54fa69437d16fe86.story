Given up chocolate for lent and hoping to stick to it once Easter has passed?

Well, one butcher's twist on the classic Easter egg may help you steer clear.

Graham Eyes has created a bizarre range of Scotch Creme Eggs - a Cadbury’s Creme Egg wrapped in 
sausage meat - or not, for those watching their waistlines - and 
flavoured with a variety of seasonings.

Graham, from Southport, Merseyside, has created the wacky Easter-themed snacks in a bid to entice more customers through the doors of his shop.

Quirky: Graham Eyes, pictured with his son Harry, has created a Cadbury's Creme Egg, wrapped in sausage meat - or not, for those watching their waistlines - and flavoured with a variety of seasonings

The 53-year-old is renowned for his unusual concoctions and after the success of last year’s Cadbury’s Mini Egg sausages, he decided to put his thinking cap on once again.

Graham, who opened his first butcher shop more than 30 years ago, said: 'So far I have had mixed reactions from people about the Scotch Creme Eggs.

'Some of my customers can’t wait to try them but other people think they just sound disgusting.

'Personally I think they are really tasty, I really like them - they’ve got a really interesting taste.

'You’ve got the sweetness from the chocolate, contrasting with the chilli and lime that we use in the coating - but the flavours go really well together.'

The sweet treats are sold ready to be cooked at home and can be cooked in the oven or deep fat fryer.

Graham has even dreamed up four different variations of the strange snack to make sure that there is something for everyone.

The first is a Scotch Creme Egg coated in breadcrumbs, and for the slimmers there is an offering without any breadcrumbs.

For the more adventurous eaters, there is a Scotch Creme Egg coated in sweet chilli. And finally Graham has created one using his special ‘wonder sausage’ mix with a crushed creme egg inside.

Bizarre: Graham and his team try to do something unusual for every special occasion - they've already got something in the pipeline for Wimbledon and for St George's Day

He added: 'We always like to do something a bit funky to get people talking. I just wanted to do something to keep the customers coming into the shop by offering them something they can’t pick up in the supermarkets.

'And last year we had a lot of success with the Easter egg sausages, especially with children.

'So we had a think about what we could do this Easter and came up with the idea of the Scotch Creme Egg.

'We try to do something unusual for every special occasion, and we’ve already got something in the pipeline for Wimbledon and for St George’s Day.'

The innovative butcher has even offered his loyal customers the chance to name the one of a kind invention.
