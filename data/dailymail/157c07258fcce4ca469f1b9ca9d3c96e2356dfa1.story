A popular YouTube prankster who boasts more than 1.2 million subscribers to his comedy channel has turned his talents for low-budget video making into a booming family business after landing his own reality series. 

Jack Vale, 41, uprooted his wife, and their five children, from their home Hungtington Beach, California, in order to move them to Las Vegas, after the now-infamous prankster's celebrity status in their local area left him unable to film his normal hidden-camera comedy series without being spotted.

'We knew we had to go somewhere because we were being recognized,' the YouTube star told Daily Mail Online.

Too famous? Jack Vale, 41, revealed to Daily Mail Online that he and his family were forced to think about moving after he began being recognized in his local area 

'You want that fresh feeling when you're uploading content and people were staring to recognize me from seeing my videos, or from being told about previous pranks and it made it difficult to keep coming up with new and exciting ideas.'

And in addition to keeping his YouTube content fresh and interesting, Jack admits his family's move to Sin City was also motivated by another factor: his new HLN reality series Jack Vale: Offline. 

The show documents the family's move from California to Nevada, and follows the Vale clan as they set out to unleash their finest pranks and practical jokes on the people of Las Vegas.  

'It's been so exciting to be in a new place, with so many more people there to interact with and work with,' Jack said. 

'We've had such a great time working here, the atmosphere is great and it's just an incredible city to be in, especially when you're doing the kind of work that we are.'

And despite some initial reservations from his family members, Jack insists both his wife and their children have taken to their new home - and their new role as his reality TV co-stars - with serious energy and enthusiasm. 

'We are really spontaneous as a family,' he explained. 'And everyone was so excited at the prospect of starting this new chapter. 

'Everyone is involved in the show; my son Jake helps with the camera work, while Chris is a wizard with social media. They all pitch in and have great ideas.

'Our house is filled with laughter and fun.'

The comedian added that, while he often dreamed of one day turned his YouTube success into a reality series, he never imagined that it would actually happen.

'I let myself think about it, I've thought about it my whole life,' he said. 'But I only realized it was an actual possibility a couple of years ago, when people started getting in touch saying that they'd like to pay to feature clips from my videos on their shows and so on. 

'That was when I started to think that maybe this dream could become a reality.'

While is show is built around practical jokes and pranking, Jack is adamant that the content, which includes everything from dressing as Santa and passing wind in an elevator to prank-calling people on Craigslist, is all completely family-friendly. 

'Some people wake up and think about what videos will make other people angry,' he said. 'They create content that they know will offend or upset others.

'That's not what I do. I create stuff that the whole family can watch and enjoy. That's why it has been so great to get my whole family involved - first in YouTube and now in the show.'
