Lee Williams was Darren Jarvis's passenger and Jacek Stawski (above) was in another car that was hit head on in the collision

The father of a man killed in a car crash has died of a broken heart following his son's death, a court has heard.

Lee Williams, 40, was in the passenger seat of best friend Darren Jarvis’ sports car when it crashed into a people carrier.

The father-of-two had returned from a family holiday to Disneyland Paris less than 24 hours earlier and was due to go for a weekend break with his wife Sian and their two children.

Mrs Williams told a court that her father-in-law John's fatal heart attack in June this year had been brought on by grief.

Jarvis had lost control of his turbo 
charged Nissan Skyline while driving at 71mph on an A-road just outside 
Aberdare, south Wales, after taking Lee Williams for a drive.

The 3.8 litre engine vehicle then crashed it into a people carrier carrying Jacek Stawski and his young son Thomas.

Both Mr Williams and Mr Stawski, who was a father-of-two, died instantly.

Jarvis was found guilty of two counts of 
causing death by dangerous driving at his trial in Cardiff Crown Court 
last month and was today jailed for four years.

His trial heard that the 
pair had met in the pub to discuss Jarvis's recent divorce, where Mr 
Williams had 'one pint' and the defendant stuck to soft drinks.

Jarvis was due to drop his friend off at 
the town's Asda supermarket, when a couple of minutes around the corner 
his sports car suddenly accelerated.

Other
 road users described the car as 'shooting off like a jet', its wheels 
spinning wildly like the start of an 'American hot rod' race.

Jarvis struggled to control the car as it spun sideways and into the path of Mr Stawski’s Citroen Xsara Picasso people carrier.

Witness Paula Evans, who was among the first on the scene, described the bloody aftermath as 'horrific'.

She told police in a victim impact statement: 'It was like something from a murder scene.'

Jarvis was found having a seizure in the wreckage, while Mr Williams and Mr Stawski were dead.

Four-year-old Thomas Stawski was alive - but found screaming in terror after witnessing the death of his father.

His defence was that he suffered a fit while at the wheel, which had caused him to lose control of the vehicle.

But Mr Justice Stewart said the evidence and the jury’s verdict proved otherwise.

He said: 'You clearly did have your foot pressed hard against the accelerator... this was a deliberate act.'

During
 sentencing today, Judge Mr Justice SP Stewart said he had to take into 
account that Jarvis’ actions had left four children fatherless and 
caused 'irreparable damage' to a number of people’s lives.

In a victim impact statement Mrs Williams, said her 'perfect family life' had been cruelly stolen from her.

'We did everything together. My children idolised their dad,' she said.

'To say that what has happened has turned my life upside down would be an understatement.'

Mrs Williams, who first met her husband in 1998, described how difficult and strange it was not to have her husband, whom she married in 2002, around the house.

Mrs Williams detailed how her youngest
 son, aged seven, regularly cries out for his daddy, while it felt as if
 her eldest, aged 11, had had his childhood stolen from him as he felt 
he 'had to be the man of the house'.

She added: 'He’s taken on all the jobs that Lee used to do like mowing the lawn.'

Mrs
 Williams said that she has tried to escape the fog of grief surrounding
 her home town in Aberdare by taking the boys to their holiday caravan 
in west Wales, where they used to spend regular weekend breaks away as a
 family.

She said her husband was the sole breadwinner, earning about £500 per week.

'However, since his death she has been unable to find work and has to try and live off £220 per week in benefit instead.

However, Mrs Williams wanted to express her thanks to the police and Crown Prosecution Service in ensuring justice had been served, as well as the support she had been given from friends and family.

'Lee was a hard working man who will never be forgotten,' she added.

While sentencing, the High Court Judge also 
noted Jarvis’ genuine remorse for causing the crash - which has left the
 defendant feeling suicidal.

Mr Justice Steward said: 'Nobody should underestimate the suffering that you have caused to others by what you did on that day.

Darren Jarvis has been jailed for four years for causing death by dangerous driving - after a road traffic accident left Jacek Stawski and Lee Williams dead

'Their lives and those of their children, family and friends have been gravely damaged.

'A prison sentence must be the inevitable result of your action. The question is for how long.

'Prison
 will not bring back the deceased to their families. The sentence is not
 meant to be, and indeed cannot be, a question of what a life is worth.

'However, I must take account of the mitigation. 'A mitigating factor is that you yourself were seriously injured in the accident.

'Medical evidence shows that your brain injury has caused cognitive and psychological difficulties.

'You have low mood anxiety and suicidal ideation.

'A
 pre-sentence report said that you expressed genuine remorse for the 
tragic consequences and feeling devastated for the families involved and
 at one point stated "I wish I’d died in the crash".

'In terms of the level of seriousness, the driving, albeit serious, was not the worst standard of driving.'
