Playing shoot 'em up games 'trains' gamers to use real guns - and specifically to aim for 'instant kills' by shooting people in the head.

Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik admitted to using Call of Duty as a training aid before the Utoya massacre - and the new discovery raises fears that other groups such as Al Qaeda could use the games in the same way.

Players used a pistol-shaped controller in a shoot 'em up, then a real gun on a mannequin - the gamers had 99% more hits in the head than non-gamers.

Anders Breivik admitted to using Call of Duty as a 'training aid' before his massacre - now a scientific study has shown that shoot em ups DO hone real-world shooting skills

¿The more frequently one plays violent shooting games, the more accurately one fires a realistic gun and aims for the head, although we can't tell from this study which factor is the cause,¿ Bushman said

Players who had 'trained' using games also had 33% more shots that hit other parts of the body.

The study found that participants who reported
habitual playing of violent shooting games also were more accurate than others
when shooting at the mannequin, and made more head shots.

It's not surprising that video games can improve shooting
accuracy -- the military, police departments and others already use video games
for training purposes, said Brad Bushman, co-author of the study and a
professor of communication and psychology at Ohio State University.

But this is the first study to show that average players
using violent shooting games with realistic human targets can improve firing
aim and accuracy.

‘For good and bad, video game players are learning lessons
that can be applied in the real world,’ Bushman said.

‘The more frequently one plays violent shooting games, the
more accurately one fires a realistic gun and aims for the head, although we
can't tell from this study which factor is the cause,’ Bushman said.

Bushman said these results should give parents and
policymakers pause.

‘We shouldn't be too quick to dismiss violent video games as
just harmless fun in a fantasy world – they can have real-world effects,’ he
said.

Brutal: Breivik said he spent up to 16 hours per day playing the violent Call of Duty video game in preparation for the attacks

Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik described how he became a deadly marksman by honing his gun 
skills by playing the violent Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare computer 
game.

The mass killer 
even bought a special gun sight used on the game - and attached it to 
the hunting rifle he used for his deadly rampage on a Norwegian island.

The Call Of Duty series, such as the Black Ops game, have often been cited as violent games

The researchers say that policymakers should examine their attitude to shoot 'em up games - and whether they really are 'harmless fun'

The study involved 151 college students who first completed
questionnaires measuring their aggression levels and their attitude toward
guns, and asked about their firearms training, their favorite video games, and
how often they played them.

They then spent 20 minutes playing one of three different
video games: a violent shooting game with realistic human targets that rewarded
head shots (Resident Evil 4); a nonviolent shooting game with bull's-eye
targets (the target practice game in Wii Play); or a nonviolent, non-shooting
game (Super Mario Galaxy).

For the two shooting games, the participants either played
with a standard controller including a joystick, or used a pistol-shaped
controller.

Immediately after playing the video game, all participants
shot 16 ‘bullets’ at a 6-foot tall, male-shaped mannequin covered in Velcro at
the end of a narrow hallway, 20 feet (6.1 meters) away.

The gun – a black airsoft training pistol -- had the same
weight, texture and firing recoil of a real 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The ‘bullets’
were .43 caliber rubber training rounds covered in soft Velcro. All
participants were instructed in the use of the pistol and wore safety goggles.

Participants who played the shooting game using a
pistol-shaped controller completed the most head shots at the mannequin (an
average of about 7). They were also the only group who completed more head
shots than they did shots to other parts of the mannequin.

‘We didn't tell them where to aim – we just told them to try
to hit the mannequin,’ Bushman said.

‘But the violent shooting game they played rewarded head
shots, and so they shot at the mannequin like they were playing the game,
aiming for the head.’

Participants who played the nonviolent, non-shooting game
had the fewest head shots, an average of about 2. Those who played the other
games, including those who played the violent shooting game with a standard
controller, fell in between those extremes.

Participants who played the violent shooting game with the
pistol-shaped controller also made the most shots to other parts of the mannequin,
averaging slightly more than 6.

Those who played the nonviolent, non-shooting game made an
average of about 4 shots to other parts of the mannequin, the least of any
group.

All of the differences among the groups regarding total hits
and head shots stayed the same even after taking into account the participants'
levels of aggressiveness, attitudes toward guns and firearm experience.

When the researchers examined the participants' experience
playing video games, they found that those who habitually played violent
shooting games had more total hits and head shots to the mannequin when
compared to less experienced players.

Tragic: Breivik also spent hours on the fantasy game World of Warcraft as he set himself up for the massacre

Some killers have credited video games for helping them
prepare, he said. For example, Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian man who
shot and killed 69 people at a youth camp in Norway last year, wrote in a
manifesto: ‘I see MW2 (Modern Warfare 2) more as a part of my
training-simulation than anything else. You can more or less completely
simulate actual operations.’

Bushman said he's not claiming that these games necessarily
lead people to commit violent crimes.

‘But this study suggests these games can teach people to
shoot more accurately and aim at the head,’ he said.
