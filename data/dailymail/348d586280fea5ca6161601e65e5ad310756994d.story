It is the ideal forecast at this time of year – but only if you’re preparing to hit the ski slopes.

For the rest of us shivering in this miserable March, the 16in of snow predicted to fall in parts of the country today will bring nothing but misery.

And there is little cheer for those who avoid the snow, with forecasters predicting heavy rain and flooding – and widespread travel chaos over the weekend.

Pretty: A glorious winter's morning in the Pennines today as a frost and covering of snow made for a crisp start to the day near Stainmore, Cumbria, where a walker took a ramble along a disused railway line

Stuck: Oliver Tempest digs out a car at the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire today, with more snow forecast

Slushy: A van makes its way along a snow-covered road near Barnard Castle in County Durham today

To make matters worse, temperatures 
are unlikely to rise before the Easter holiday the following weekend 
meaning that any hope of more spring-like conditions will have to wait 
until next month.

The Met Office has issued four severe 
weather warnings for today and the rain was so heavy last night in the 
South West that police urged drivers not to go out. Flooding was 
reported in Newlyn and Penzance and threatening Devon.

As the downpours moved north last 
night, they were expected to turn to sleet and heavy snow which 
threatens to blanket swathes of the Midlands and northern England over 
the weekend.

Up to 16in of snow could fall today in
higher parts of the Midlands, forecasters warned, while 2.5in of rain 
will swamp the South West in 24 hours. Northern Wales and North-West 
England are also likely to have some snow today, while tomorrow it may 
even bring wintry showers to London.

The AA has told motorists that even 
short journeys could be difficult, and warned there could be a repeat of
the scenes in southern England last week when hundreds of drivers were 
stranded overnight in their cars.

The Environment Agency said it was 
monitoring river levels in the South West and had already issued flood 
alerts, with more serious flood warnings also a possibility for the 
region.

A spokesman said: ‘We strongly urge people to keep a close eye 
on local weather forecasts and be prepared for possible flooding.

'We 
also ask people to stay safe and not try to wade or drive through deep 
water.’

Charlie Powell from the Met Office 
said: ‘The heavy rain will have moved overnight from the South West 
towards the North East, turning into snow from the middle of the country
northwards.

Sent in: MailOnline reader Tom Beresford took this picture of two snow ploughs meeting in the middle of Fleet Moss in North Yorkshire this week. 'Looks like we are going to get a load more snow,' he said

‘It will feel pretty miserable no 
matter where you are. Today and tomorrow will bring either rain or snow 
for much of the country so be prepared.

‘Unfortunately, although it will clear
up by Sunday, the rest of the week looks cold and dry, and there’s 
unlikely to be any warmer weather til Easter.’

Darron Burness, the AA’s Head of 
Special Operations, said: ‘It’s going to be a real witch’s brew of 
driving wind, rain and snow, which will inevitably cause disruption on 
the roads.

'Drivers should be well prepared as even short journeys can 
quickly turn bad.’

He added: ‘Wherever you’re going, take
plenty of warm layers, check the travel reports before heading out and 
stick to the main roads where possible.’

The Local Government Association said 
council gritting and ploughing teams would be out in force to try to 
ensure main roads remained passable.

It’s hard to believe that exactly 12 months ago we were in the grip of a drought.

This was the scene today on the River Pang at Bucklebury Ford in Berkshire, 
which was so flooded that the road through it has been shut. Last March the river was dry and the road was passable.

Two feet of water was rushing past the measuring post at the side of the
ford today, which alerts drivers to the depth. Most family cars would 
flood if they tried to drive through the ford.

One motorist could not believe that a huge decaying tree stump, usually stuck
in the mud around 100 yards upstream from the ford, had been washed 
away.

He said: ‘That tree trunk was massive and by the footbridge this time last year. The flood-swollen river is now flowing so 
fast that it has picked it up and dumped it 100 yards away.'

A Thames Water spokesman said: ‘With ground water levels behaving as
they should we expect rivers to act as they should. We don't expect 
to be imposing any water restriction this year.

‘However, with the topsy-turvy British weather we can't offer a cast-iron guarantee with that.’

And spare a thought for these daffodils…

These pictures taken 12 months apart show how the weather has affected the daffodil season.

This field in Montrose, Angus, was ablaze with the yellow flowers in March last year, but it is now a bleak, barren landscape after being blasted by freezing temperatures and a deluge of snow.

Grampian Growers managing director Mark Clark is now expecting a huge loss in income as the company battles to win contracts with shops when they don't even have any daffodils to sell.

He said: ‘Basically we're four weeks behind schedule already and the way things are looking there will be a great difficulty in getting daffodils in shops for Easter.'

Last year, Grampian Growers lost 15million daffodils, worth £300,000, because it was too warm.
