Two sisters orphaned in last year's Alps massacre have started a new life with their aunt and uncle, but will always have armed police guards, it emerged today.

Zainab al-Hilli, eight, and her sister Zeena, four, lost their parents and grandmother after they were gunned down in their BMW on a holiday to Lake Annecy on September 5, 2012.

Saad al-Hilli, 50, mother Iqbal, 47, and grandmother Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, were killed alongside 45-year-old French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, in a crime that has still not been solved.

Mystery: Zainab Al-Hilli, 8, was pistol-whipped and left for dead, and sister Zeena hid under her dead mother's skirt in the unsolved Alps massacre that claimed the lives of their parents and grandparents

Zainab was left fighting for her life after being shot in the shoulder and bludgeoned over the head with a gun, while Zeena hid underneath her mother's skirt in the back of the car and survived unscathed.

Ruling: High Court judge Justice Baker today agreed the orphans' maternal aunt and uncle should be their guardians

But because it is believed Zainab
 saw the assassin, the sisters will be getting an armed police guard, the High Court heard.

Judge Justice Baker made special guardianship orders allowing the orphans to live with their
 maternal aunt, uncle and cousin.

In making the guardianship order he commended the aunt and uncle 'for the dedication that have shown to the girls. They have without hesitation taken on the responsibility of caring for their nieces and welcomed them into their home.

'They have, of course, had to do this whilst addressing their own grief and sense of loss. They have had to withstand the intrusion of professionals coming to carry out assessments and other enquiries and the inevitable media attention.

'I commend them for all that they have done, and all that they are going to do in future, for the benefit of the girls'.

He also sent his 'very best wishes to the girls. In the last few weeks, they have moved to live with their aunt and uncle and have started their new schools'.

The girls had been in foster care since the murders.

Another uncle 54-year-old Zaid al-Hilli from Chessington , Surrey is on bail over the deaths thought to be linked to a disputed will. But he denies any wrongdoing.

Under the special guardianship order the aunt and uncle are given exclusive power to exercised parental responsibility for the children.

The judge said it also provides a degree of permanence, stability, and security for the children.

Denial: Zaid Al-Hilli says he does not have any involvement in his brother's death, and remains on police bail

He added: 'It is in the interests of Zainab and Zeena to retain their existing family links and their identity as the children of their tragically deceased parents.

'Accordingly, and rightly, no party has proposed adoption as the appropriate outcome in this case. Manifestly, however, given their traumatic experiences, they do require an order which gives them a higher degree of stability and permanence and in my judgment a special guardianship order meets that requirement.

'Accordingly I make special guardianship orders appointed the aunt and uncle to be special guardians of the girls.'

He said the local authority would still provide support for the girls.

The aunt and uncle have made an application to live permanently in England . The judge said while it was not a matter for him but the immigration authorities, in his judgment 'it would manifestly be in the best interests of the girls for a way to be found for them to continue to live in this country with their aunt and uncle.'

The ruling was made earlier this month but only made public today.
