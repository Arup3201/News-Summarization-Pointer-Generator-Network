Loney Garrett was arrested and charged with ill treatment of animals after the remains of more than 200 dogs were found at his home

Police discovered the remains of more than 200 dogs in a hunter's back garden after neighbours complained of a 'persistent stench'.

Officials said it was one of the largest case of animal cruelty they had seen.

About 45 'emaciated' dogs were rescued from the home and taken away from treatment.

Loney L Garrett, of Goose Creek, South Carolina, was arrested and charged with ill treatment of animals on Monday.

Deputies from Berkeley County Sheriff's Office said there had been little attempt made to bury the animals and many of the bones were found on the surface or discarded in a ditch.

Officials said that some of the dead dogs did not die of natural causes and some were found with bullet wounds to the head.

Dan Moon, from the sheriff's office, told ABC News4 said he had not heard of an animal cruelty case on this scale before.

Deputies spent hours combing the yard and placed pink flags in the ground to mark where each body or bone was found.

Mr Moon told the news station: 'There are thousands of dog bones back in there.'

Some of the remains had been left at the property for a long time, he said.

Police sealed off the perimeter with tape while they searched the grounds.

Mr Moon said the rescued dogs were seriously emaciated and may not survive.

He said: 'I don't know how many of them will make it. They were skin and bones.'

Deputies recovered hundreds of dog bones from the property in Goose Creek, South Carolina

Pink flags were placed to mark where the remains were found and deputies said some dogs had bullet wounds

A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she had seen the skeletal remains of more than ten dogs discarded in a ditch.

She said it was 'really heartbreaking' that they had not been buried properly. 

However, Mr Garrett's daughter-in-law said he had been painted as a monster and that he cared for animals.

Diane Luckie claimed she had fed the animals with Garrett and they were thin because they were used to hunt deer and rabbits.

Police were called after neighbours complained about the smell but Garrett's relatives said he loved the dogs

She said: 'He's not done anything wrong but love those animals. He has no intentions to hurt those animals.'

She said the animals needed to be thin to chase the deer and that the exercise made them lose weight.

Garrett was expected to go before a bond court judge yesterday.
