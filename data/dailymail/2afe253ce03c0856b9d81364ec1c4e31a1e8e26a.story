Overlooked: TUC boss Frances O'Grady believes politicians should stop ignoring 'sensible proposals' to increase secret ballot turnouts 

Union leaders yesterday called for Margaret Thatcher’s anti-strike laws to be unpicked to allow ballots on industrial action to take place in the workplace and on the internet.

They claimed the reason turnouts in recent strike ballots were so poor was because they have to be conducted by postal vote, with papers sent to members’ homes.

TUC boss Frances O’Grady said: ‘Instead of imposing a ballot threshold that not a single MP met in the last election, politicians should stop ignoring sensible proposals to increase secret ballot turnouts at the workplace and online.

‘It is hard to see how an offer to depress living standards for the foreseeable future and stop people doing anything about it will win votes at the next election.’

Mick Cash, acting general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, warned of wildcat strikes if changes are made to balloting laws.

‘If you remove the right to strike legally or make it almost impossible, then workers will, understandably, take matters into their own hands,’ he said.

‘If a majority of workers in a democratic, secret ballot decide to take action as last resort over their safety or jobs but the Government or a judge says you can’t do that because you’ve not reached a threshold or because this is an essential service, it is obvious how workers with a proud militant tradition will react.

‘They will eventually take their own action and you will see highly disruptive wildcat action called at very short or no notice.’

Though yesterday’s strikes were based on ballots held in some cases several years ago, which saw low turnout from members, union leaders insisted their action was ‘valid and lawful’.

Business leaders are pressing for a new law setting a target of at least 50 per cent of those balloted having to vote in favour.
