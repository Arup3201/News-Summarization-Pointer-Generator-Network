It is the biggest night in television's social calendar. But before the stars trod the red carpet and the gongs were awarded at last night's Arqiva British Academy Television Awards, military-like preparations were underway.

And a large part of those were happening in the Baftas style suites: lavish temples to hair, make-up and fashion set up in the confines of the luxury Corinthia hotel.

There, Bafta nominees and presenters were cossetted away in the hotel's best suites where they were tanned, made-up and coiffured to within an inch of their lives by the world's top glamour hit squads.

Millie Mackintosh's was given a stunning Hollywood glamour 
look, Sienna Miller, flying in from the States, was given a fake tan to top up her real LA glow, while Olivia Colman had an emergency short-lived tan that wouldn't mess with continuity when she rushed back to filming today.

It may have been raining on the red carpet last night but that didn't stop the stars from exposing some skin in their showstopping gowns.

And no great designer dress is complete without a golden tan so St. Tropez were on hand to give the stars their sunkissed glow.

Sienna Miller, who jetted in from the U.S. giving the bash a bit of an A-list appeal, looked bang on trend in a cute powder blue Matthew Williamson frock.

As the perfect English rose, Sienna opted for a tan named just that.

'Sienna wanted a subtle glow for the red carpet. A layer of StTropez Self Tan Sensitive Bronzing Spray, was applied the day before and left on for just six hours to deliver a natural and subtle glow,' said Jules Heptonstall.

As for woman of the night Olivia Colman, who took home two trophies, Jules gave her 'The Instant Glow.'

He explained: 'As Olivia had been filming her next project she needed a no commitment product to give her a quick glow in time for the red carpet.

'A layer of St.Tropez Instant Wash Off Glow Body, was applied just before the ceremony. As a finishing touch St.Tropez Gold Illuminator, was added to the décolleté.'

Glowing goddess, and former face of the brand, Millie Mackintosh was quick to get herself a gorgeous tan.

The Made In Chelsea star, who is famed for her bronzed skin, opted for The Golden Goddess and was covered head-to-toe in the products.

'To give a gentle soft glow to Millie's skin one coat of St Tropez Self Tan Classic Bronzing Mist was applied all over the day before the awards. On the day a mix of St Tropez Tan Enhancing Body Moisturiser with a pump of St. Tropez Instant Wash Off Glow Mousse was applied to her legs to lift colour and add hydration.

Golden glow: Kara Tointon and Binky Felstead were also treated to a red carpet glow for the evening

'To finish the look and to draw attention to Millie's great legs a little StTropez Gold Illuminator was applied down the front of the shin and thighs to add a little sheen.

'Finally a little illuminator was added to her shoulders and décolleté.'

As television's finest poured onto the red carpet last night, there were flashbulbs left, right and centre so a flawless beauty look was a prerequisite.

That's where M∙A∙C cosmetics worked their magic. As the official make-up partner to the Arqiva British Academy Television Awards - for the 10th consecutive year - M∙A∙C know a thing or two about Bafta beauty.

Speaking about last night's makeup trends, M∙A∙C Senior Artist, Rebecca Butterworth said: ‘Early 20th century glamour inspired last night’s beauty, with many looks referencing the vintage feel of Parades End and The Great Gatsby.

'Eyes were darkened with veils of smoke while lips took inspiration from Silent Hollywood starlets, all offset against a canvas of velvet textured skin.

'Bright reds were also hugely popular, and brought a spring/summer feel to the night.’

This year, M∙A∙C has provided make-up support for 10 of the nominated TV productions including: Game of Thrones, Girls, The Graham Norton Show, Ripper Street, Parade's End and Henry IV.

No red carpet look is complete without a bouncy set of tresses and celebrity hairdresser Mark Hill and his team were on hand to style the lock's of TV's finest.

Millie, who has come to be known as the fashionista of reality TV, opted for a more understated look this year.

The TV Bafta winner went for a minimal half up-do to complement her chic black strapless Sass & Bide dress.

'This effortless look on the red carpet was in contrast to the glitz and glam of many other celebrities this year,' said her stylist.

Could this be a hint of what she might opt for on her wedding day?

Presenter Zoe Hardman’s romantic side swept waves were created with Mark Hill Rock Rollers and kept in place with a spritz of Big Night Out Firm Hold Hairspray.

'This elegant look is perfect to take you from am to pm in style,' said her hairdresser.

The Rock Chick Wave Wand was used to give a delicate wave to frame her face and fixed with Defrizzilicious Bedazzled Anti-Humidity Shine Spray to keep the frizz at bay and give a glossy finish.

The key to the perfect red carpet look is the dress and House of Fraser set up a stylish dressing room within The Corinthia to help the stars dress to impress.

Sipping on champagne and nibbling on chocolates, the actors and actresses browsed the rails and picked out their favourite designs.
