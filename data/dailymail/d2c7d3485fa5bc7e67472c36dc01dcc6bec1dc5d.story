There was a time at the World Cup when managers had to get by with just 11 men. They would name their starting selection and the game would unfold, for better or worse, largely beyond their control.

But the impact substitute carries an ever increasing importance, as shown by the record 29 goals scored so far in Brazil by those who have been summoned from the bench.

This tally is already six goals more than the second highest total, set in 2006, and we still have the business end of the tournament to get through.

Impact: Romelu Lukaku emerged from the bench to score Belgium's extra time winner against the United States and seal a quarter-final place

Match winner: Andre Schurrle, a half-time replacement for Mario Gotze, scored the goal that took Germany into the last eight at the expense of Algeria

Pretty much every team at the World Cup has an ace up their sleeve, from Haris Seferovic of Switzerland, who came on to grab the winner against Ecuador, to Miroslav Klose, who netted with his first touch in Germany's draw with Ghana.

Silvestre Varela earned Portugal a draw against the United States in the 94th minute after emerging from the bench, while Andre Schurrle made a crucial intervention in Germany's second round tie with Algeria having missed out on the starting XI.

On Tuesday night, Romelu Lukaku came on at the start of extra time to conjure Belgium's winner against the United States and book a quarter-final place.

Crucial intervention: Switzerland's Haris Seferovic scored a late winner against Ecuador having come on with 15 minutes left

Costa Rica, Russia, USA, South Korea, Ivory Coast, Colombia, Chile, Greece, Spain, Bosnia, Mexico, Algeria and Brazil have also benefited from a substitute scorer.

But the master of introducing the impact sub seems to be Holland's Louis van Gaal, with Dutch players scoring from the bench no less than four times at the tournament.

On two occasions it was Memphis Depay, who came on to score the winner against Australia and the crucial second against Chile.

Breakthrough: Leroy fer celebrates after scoring for Holland against Chile after coming on

Norwich's Leroy Fer had earlier scored against Chile from the substitutes' list and, most recently, Klaas Jan Huntelaar, a replacement for Robin van Persie, converted the winning penalty against Mexico to take them through to the quarter-finals.

The 29 goals scored by subs at this year's tournament already far exceeds the previous best - 23 back in 2006 - illustrating the value of strength-in-depth at major tournaments.Â
