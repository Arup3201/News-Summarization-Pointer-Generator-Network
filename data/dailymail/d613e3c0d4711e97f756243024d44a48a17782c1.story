The Muslim activist who sparked an uproar with a planned lecture on honour killings won't say if he believes they are justifiable, telling critics they will have to wait to read his writing on the topic instead.

Uthman Badar, spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir, was due to speak at the Sydney Opera House in August on whether honour killings could be morally justified, but it was cancelled within hours of being announced due to public outrage.

Mr Badar said the backlash against his slated Festival of Dangerous Ideas talk said more about bigotry in Australia than it did about him.

Uthman Badar defended a cancelled speech he was due to give on the topic of honour killings at the Opera House in August, saying the organisers insisted he talk about them

'I think the hysteria says a lot about Islamophobia,' Mr Badar told reporters on Wednesday.

'People want to say “Hang on, there is freedom (of speech), you can say what you want, but that was just beyond the pale”.

'The reality is I hadn't even opened my mouth… words were shoved in my mouth, the position was assumed.'

Mr Badar did not choose the lecture title but said he was consulted by organisers.

Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman Mr Badar, said 'hysteria' won out after the Sydney Opera House back flipped on plans for a public talk on honour killings during its Festival of Dangerous Ideas on August 30

'I, in fact, suggested a more direct topic about Islam and secular liberalism ... something like 'The West needs saving by Islam'… but the organisers insisted on this topic, which I think is still a worthy topic of discussion,' he wrote on Facebook.

'The suggestion that I would advocate for honour killings, as understood in the west, is ludicrous and something I would normally not deem worth of dignifying with a response.'

The Opera House would not answer questions about who decided on the title of the talk, while festival co-organisers the St James Ethics Centre did not respond to a request for comment.

'The point of the speech was to question some of the assumptions on the issue of honour killings,' Mr Badar said on Wednesday.

'In the end, the issue is not about violence towards women or anyone else, but it's about cultural and political imposition, imposing liberal values in third world countries.'

Mr Badar wouldn't be drawn on the central question - whether he personally believed honour killings, a term usually used to mean the killing of women deemed to have 'shamed' their families, could ever be justified.

'Wait for my opinion piece,' he said.

But he did say Islam opposed violence against women and has previously hit back at suggestions he would advocate honour killings as 'ludicrous'.

Mr Badar's decision to speak out came after federal and NSW politicians Julie Bishop, Pru Goward and Fred Nile, as well as high-profile radio broadcaster Alan Jones, slammed the lecture plans.

'In this current period where there is so much concern about home-grown jihadists, the last thing we need is a debate like this,' Ms Goward told ABC Radio.

'It is a truly dangerous idea.'

In a statement on its Facebook on Tuesday, the Opera House said: 'The Festival of Dangerous Ideas is intended to be a provocation to thought and discussion, rather than simply a provocation'.

'It is always a matter of balance and judgement, and in this case a line has been crossed... It is clear from the public reaction that the title has given the wrong impression of what Mr Badar intended to discuss.

'Neither Mr Badar, (festival organisers) the St James Ethics Centre, nor Sydney Opera House in any way advocates honour killings or condones any form of violence against women.'

Mr Badar's defence comes as it was revealed the Prime Minister's plan to stop extremists fighting in the Middle East from returning to Australia was in legal limbo.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been faced with a legal problem in the wake of news that most Australians fighting in the middle east are Australian-only citizens

The government, who had been determined to strip the rights of jihadists on dual citizenship from entering and exiting the country, will not have the same powers to do so with those on a single citizenship.

Under constitutional law, it is illegal to withdrawal a person of their citizenship rights if it renders them stateless.

Fairfax Media reported that Immigration Minister Scott Morrison told a Coalition party-room meeting on Tuesday the majority of the 150 people involved in extremist activity in the Middle East are believed to be Australian citizens only. 

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop had previously said she vowed to continue canceling the passports of Australians suspected of being a threat to national security, including those thinking of going abroad to fight.
