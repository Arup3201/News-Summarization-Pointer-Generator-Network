Kidnap survivor Elizabeth Smart-Gilmour has told a human trafficking forum that children can be abducted from anywhere and the vigilance of authorities 'makes a difference' in finding them.

Describing her capture and repeated sexual assault as a teen, the 26-year-old stressed that law enforcers must have protocols in place to deal with rescued victims. 

'(Human trafficking) is everywhere whether you accept it or not,' she said at the South Dakota conference on Wednesday.

'It's in my hometown. It's here in your hometown. It's everywhere, and 
as soon as we open our eyes and acknowledge that, the sooner we can 
start to make a difference.'

Smart-Gilmour made headlines after she 
disappeared from her bedroom in 2002. Despite a nationwide search, she 
was not found for nine months.

The Utah resident opened up about her experience at a three-day conference organized by Avera Health and the U.S. Attorney's Office.

The forum aimed to raise awareness about 
human trafficking in the Dakotas, which in North Dakota has been partly 
fueled by the recent massive influx of workers to the Bakken oil fields.

A new screening tool for trafficking 
victims was unveiled at the forum on Tuesday, as law enforcement 
officials outlined the issue of forced prostitution and internet-based 
crimes against children.

Smart-Gilmour, an advocate for kidnap victims, told police, health care and social workers at the conference to keep up the fight against human trafficking. 

'People like you brought me back,' she said.

Smart-Gilmour, who got married in February 2012, told conference attendees how she was moved from Utah to California and was constantly threatened with death if she tried to escape by her captor.

She stressed that authorities must have protocols in place to deal with rescued victims. 

She recalled how she was handcuffed, taken to the police station and left in a 'little room with no windows' right after police officers found her.

The situation, she said, did not make her feel comfortable.

Since her rescue, she has started the 
Elizabeth Smart Foundation to protect children and educate them about 
violent and sexual crimes.

Smart-Gilmour was abducted at knife-point from her bedroom in 2002.

She was found nine months later when an alert biker who heard about her case on America's Most Wanted, spotted her at a diner about 18 miles from her Utah home.

She was kidnapped and held captive by one-time itinerant street preacher Brian David Mitchell and his wife Wanda Barzee.

Mitchell continuously raped her, and even forced her to marry him in a bizarre, secret ceremony.

In May 2011, Mitchell was convicted of kidnapping and sexual assault and was sentenced to life in prison.

Barzee was sentenced to 15 years in a Texas federal prison hospital for her role in the kidnapping.
