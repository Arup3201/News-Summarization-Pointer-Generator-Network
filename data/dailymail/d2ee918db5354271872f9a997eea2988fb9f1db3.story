Tragic: Schoolgirl Lindsey Inger, 13, died after being hit by a tram at a notoriously dangerous crossing in Nottingham

A teenage girl died after being hit by a tram at a level crossing - four years after a woman and her grandson were killed at the same spot.

Lindsey Inger, 13, was rushed to hospital following the accident in Hucknall, Nottingham, last night but later died from her injuries.

The tram driver and her devastated friends were also treated for shock.

Police have launched an investigation to establish what happened, but campaigners say the crossing is notoriously dangerous and should be closed.

School dinner lady Jean Hoggart, 56, and
her seven-year-old grandson Mikey Dawson were killed when they were hit
by a train at the same crossing in November 2008.

Lindsey's friend Paige Layton  said the group of friends had been walking home to Paige's home in Bestwood Village when the accident happened.

She said they did not see or hear the tram approach on the dark crossing.

'We were all crossing and I was holding Lindsey’s hand and the tram just came and took her and she went flying,' the 13-year-old said tearfully.

Paige’s mother, Tara, added: 'This area is not secure enough. They were not messing about, or anything. They were just four friends, walking to my house, hand-in-hand.

'Accidents have happened here before 
and I’m surprised nothing has been done. Why does it have to take 
another life for someone to do anything?

'This shouldn’t be a walkway if no-one is going to make it secure.'

Notorious: Local residents say the crossing in Hucknall, Nottingham, has been an accident black spot for years. A woman and her grandson died at the same spot in November 2008

Yesterday tributes flooded into a Facebook page set up in the Year 9 pupil’s memory.

Friend Kaine Richards, wrote: 'R.I.P 
beautiful. Gone but never forgotten baby fly high up there hope your 
looking down on everyone. Everyone's missing you and thinking of you.'

Another pal said: 'R.I.P Lindsey for 
ever in our hearts !! Going to miss Your hugs so much !! most of all I’m
going to miss you so much R.I.P princess.'

In a statement issued by Ellis 
Guildford School and Sports College, where Lindsey was a student, 
headteacher Sally Coulton said: 'Staff and pupils at the school deeply 
shocked by Lindsey’s death and are struggling to come to terms with what
has happened.

'Our thoughts and sympathies are with her friends and family at this sad time.'

The crossing, which is in two sections 
and includes separate tram and train tracks running parallel to each 
other with an ‘island’ in between them, has hand gates and warning 
signs.

A new gate and warning signs were installed after Mrs Hoggart and Mikey were killed.

Mrs Hoggart’s widower, Laurence, 
received an undisclosed payout from Network Rail earlier this year after
it accepted responsibility following the deaths.

A report into the 2008 tragedy by 
RAIB concluded: 'The risk to pedestrians presented by tram operations 
running parallel to the Network Rail line was not considered by any 
party.

Tributes: Friends left heartfelt messages on a Facebook page set up in memory of the Year 9 pupil

'There was no appreciation that 
crossings in darkness present different risks to pedestrians compared 
with during daylight hours.'

But at the time of Mr Hoggart’s 
payout, local councillor Chris Baron said: 'Network Rail has made quite a lot of alterations
to the crossing but I still think it vital that the gate should lock 
automatically when a train is approaching.'

The crossing is administered by Network Rail and tram operator NET (Nottingham Express Transit) who are helping police with their inquiries.

Local councillors, residents and 
an MP - as well as Lindsey’s friends - said it Is dangerous and should 
be closed.

Hucknall councillor Mr 
Baron said: 'This girl had her whole 
life ahead of her. This is the third fatality in four years, and there 
have been other incidents too.

'We need gates that lock 
automatically when a train or tram is coming, and warning lights that 
flash so that pedestrians can get across in safety. Up to 200 people use
it daily, and it is a very dark crossing.

'Network Rail and NET need to put 
their heads together. I do not know the ins and outs of this tragedy, 
but something is obviously not right.

'It is time it was sorted, before we have another one. The easiest solution would be to close it completely.'

Local resident Daniel Hall, 27, said: 'It’s disgusting. It has been a death-trap for years. The fact there 
are trams and trains travelling in the same direction at different 
speeds confuses people. There have been plans for a bridge for ages, but
nothing has been done.”

Mark Spencer, the MP for Sherwood, said: 'There is clearly a problem at this 
point, because there have been a number of accidents and we need to 
separate trams from pedestrians here. The best way to do that would be 
with a bridge.'

Lindsey’s friends have now started a petition to have automatically locking gates installed at the crossing.

General manager of NET Neil Wood said: 'Our 
thoughts and sympathy are with the teenager’s family at this time. We 
have launched our own internal inquiry into the incident.'

The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) has also started an inquiry.
