If you thought you'd seen the last of 'Tan Mom', think again.

Patricia Krentcil, known for frying herself to a crisp on dangerous tanning beds, is back on the scene - but not as you know her.

The 47-year-old, whose overly tanned appearance made her an overnight sensation, is barely recognisable after ditching her orange hue.

'Tan mom' Patricia Krentcil is back and she's ditched the sunbeds but is hooked on Botox

Showing off her new look in Closer magazine, Patricia did, however, reveal that she's swapped tanning in favour of a new beauty treatment: Botox.

The mother, from Nutley, New Jersey, revealed she has the £200 injections every three months - and her new paler look has even boosted her sex life with stockerbroker husband, 49-year-old Richard.

'I started reading about celebrities having Botox and realised that could give me the same confidence without damaging my skin,' she explained. 'I couldn't believe the results.'

Maintaining that she won't get addicted, she is also considering having an eye lift and a treatment to smooth her chest to fix damage left from the 20 sunbeds a month she once favoured. 

Admitting her tanning addiction was a 'huge mistake', the mother-of-three explains that her family feared for her health so she decided to quit the beds.

In 2012 she was accused of taking her five-year-old daughter, Anna, into a tanning booth. 

She faced child endangerment charges after school officials noticed burns on her daughter's legs, which Patricia claimed came from sunburn when her child played outdoors.

While she eventually was absolved of the charges, her overly tanned appearance made her an overnight sensation and she was paid thousands of pounds to attend events.

She also entered herself into World Xtreme Entertainment's Celebrity Boxing contest, to fight Ang Cottone, aka, Milf Mom, last year.

But Krentcil couldn't wait for the ring and after chugging down beer at the press conference table (she completed a stay in rehab last year for alcohol abuse) she started on her opponent.

Things got so turbulent that Krentcil needed to be restrained after flipping the table at the event in Woodlyn, Pennsylvania.
