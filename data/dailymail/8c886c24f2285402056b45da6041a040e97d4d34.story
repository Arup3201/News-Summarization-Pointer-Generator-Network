They have been best friends since they were eight years old but Sarah and Paige had never met in person until this summer.

The girls bonded over the challenges they both face after being born without an arm, but with Sarah in Indiana, and Paige in Auckland, New Zealand, their only contact has been through the internet.

Skype had helped made distance between the girls' homes seem, but after Paige and Sarah submitted their story to its Stay Together campaign, the company decided to go one step further.Â

Close: Despite living thousands of miles apart Paige, left, and Sarah are good friendsOver the summer Sarah and her family flew to Auckland to finally meet her best friend, who she describes as a 'long lost sister'.

'We have been so close for eight years but thousands of miles away from each other,' Sarah, from Nappanee, said on a video clip made about the friends.

After a tearful hug outside Paige's home, the teenagers were quickly gossiping and giggling like old friends.

The girls first learned about each other when their mothers bonded over the internet after both having babies born with only one arm.

Sarah's mother was 20 weeks pregnant when she was told her daughter was missing a limb.

'She wanted to find someone else who was experiencing the same thing so she went on a website and found Theresa and Paige,' Sarah said.

History: Sarah looks through news clippings with her mother. Her family reached out to Paige's parents because of the girls' disability

For the first few years of their life, the family sent updates and photos to each other, but gradually lost touch.

But, as Sarah started to get older, she missed having a friend who understood the challenges she faced.

'I was eight. I needed someone 
there who could understand everything about me and then I was like, "I 
want to find Paige",' she said. 'When I first saw Paige it was like seeing a mirror image.'

The girls chat a couple of times a week on Skype and, with an 18-hour time difference, have two clocks in their bedrooms so they always know what time it is in the other one's country.

Paige said: 'When I saw Sarah it was like "Oh,
this is how people see me". She taught me a lot and gave me a lot of 
confidence.'

The girls talk about the same things any other teenager would, but knowing someone else has been born with the same disability is a valuable dimension to their friendship.

'There weren't less challenges after I met her but I wasn't 
going through the challenges alone anymore,' Paige said.

Sarah and Paige plan to go traveling together when they are older and hope to one day live closer together.
