Paedophile: Lee Christie terrorised teenage girls over the internet. On one occasion he forced a girl to cut herself as he watched

A predatory paedophile who terrorised teenage girls over the internet has been jailed for eight years.

Lee Christie, 43, of Newark, Nottinghamshire, pretended to be a teenage boy to persuade young girls to strip and carry out indecent acts online.

He manipulated and threatened his ten victims, who were aged between 13 and 16, and accumulated thousands of indecent images of children.

On one occasion, Christie pressured a 14-year-old girl to harm herself as he watched on webcam after threatening to send indecent images of her to her parents and post them online.

He told one of his youngest victims, aged just 13, that he would kill her family if she didn’t do what he asked.

Christie admitted 23 charges and was sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court today.

Nearly 70,000 indecent images and videos of children were found on two of his computers, as well as a further 3,000 images of extreme pornography.

Nottinghamshire Police was contacted by the Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre (CEOP) after Christie was intercepted on a U.S. social networking site claiming to be a teenage boy.

Users claimed he had been persuading young girls to expose themselves online and had boasted that he owned a large collection of indecent images of young girls.

In January 2012, Christie was arrested by officers from the Force’s Sexual Exploitation Investigation Unit raided his Newark home.

It was when officers began to examine Christie’s computers that the full extent of his devious offending became clear.

Detective Constable Andy Taylor, from Notts police’s Sexual Exploitation Investigation Unit, said: 'Christie used MSN and social networking sites to get close to girls all over the country.'

He added: 'In reality, he was a man in his forties locked away at home obsessed with young girls.

'He would first get them to trust him before persuading them to take their clothes off online. Once he had images of them, he would blackmail them to do what he asked.

'The girls he targeted were very young and vulnerable and they became terrified of him. He would threaten to turn up at their doors and hurt them and their family if they did not carry out his orders.

'He even made one girl cut herself as he watched - he was spiralling out of control and caused untold damage to his victims.

'It’s fortunate that his devious behaviour was noticed by other people online and the authorities were notified.'

Christie admitted that he possessed a huge catalogue of indecent images of children and confessed to using a number of fake profiles on social networking sites, posing as a teenage boy to get close to young girls.

He admitted to spending up to 20 hours a day on the internet trying to entice young girls to strip and engage in sexual activity online.

Chat logs found on his computers showed Christie had been discussing the sexual abuse of young girls with other paedophiles.

It was also discovered that Christie had taken indecent images of two girls, then aged 13 and 14, at an address in Nottinghamshire in 2004.

Christie pleaded guilty to 15 counts of making indecent images of children, possession of 69, 542 indecent images of children and six counts of causing a female aged 13 or over to engage in sexualactivity.

He also admitted possession of extreme pornography and a prohibited image of a child.

He will sign the sex offenders register for life and was given a sexual offences prevention order for life.
