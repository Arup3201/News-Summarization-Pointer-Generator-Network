Lifesaver: Koalas lower their body temperature by clinging to trees

The image of a koala hugging a tree is as Australian as a barbecue with a few tinnies.

That cute pose, however, turns out to play a vital role in the marsupial’s survival.

By wrapping their bodies round cool tree trunks, the animals can stop themselves overheating during long, hot summers.

Researchers at Melbourne University used radio collars to track koalas’ movements and thermal imaging to measure the trunk temperature of the trees they chose to sit in.

During the summer, they sat lower in trees, where it was cooler, and were more likely to stretch out and hug the trunk.

Tree trunk temperatures were up to 9C below air temperature, with the bark of their favourite species particularly cool, the Royal Society journal Biology Letters reports.

It is thought this allowed them to transfer heat away from their body, without the danger of dehydration that comes with panting.

Researcher Natalie Briscoe said: ‘Access to these trees can save about half the water a koala would need to keep cool on a hot day.’

'Our results highlight the 
important role of tree trunks as above ground ‘heat sinks’, providing 
cool microenvironments not only for koalas, but also for all tree 
dwelling species.'

Co-researcher Andrew Krockenberger said: ‘About a quarter of koalas in one population died during a heat wave in 2009, so understanding the types of factors that can make some populations more resilient is important.’

The team added that other tree-loving animals, including monkeys and leopards, are likely to use a similar strategy.

A healthy koala lives up to 16 years. There were once millions in Australia, but they were hunted heavily for their fur in the early 1900s.

Last year the Australian government listed koalas in Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory as a threatened species, and some are even warning the animal could face extinction if more is not done to protect it.
