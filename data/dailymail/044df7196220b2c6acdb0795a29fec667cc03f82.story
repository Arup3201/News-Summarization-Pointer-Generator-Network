Lionel Messi has done almost everything for Argentina at this World Cup, but against Holland he couldn't inspire them to a win in normal time. In fact, he didn't even manage a touch in the Dutch box.

And so the crucial semi final went to penalties. Messi calmly and comfortably tucked his away and it set the tone for the Argentinians in the shootout - scoring all four. Messi might just have made the difference again, sorting out his side when it most mattered.

Here, Sportsmail goes through Argentina's little magician's performance minute-by minute:

play it back to the Napoli forward but Messi is brought down.

wall but Jasper Cillessen saves.

Half time: Louis van Gaal chooses to sub Martins-Indi off - presumably because he can't get close to Messi, is constantly fouling him and one more could equal a red card.

51 minutes: Messi looks like he's going to break away through on goal but Cillessen comes out to clear it. The ball deflects back off Messi and looks as if it might be trickling towards goal before it rolls wide. The flag was up anyway.

61 minutes: De Jong is subbed off, which could be good news for Messi - the midfield destroyer has been on his back all night.

71 minutes: Messi gets a chance to run after the ball breaks to him but he lets it run too far in front of him and loses possession.

72 minutes: With the rain melting down Argentina get a chance with a free kick deep inside the Dutch half on the right wing. Messi takes it but it soars over everyone and out of play. Poor.

Tough gig: Messi found it difficult to break through in the first half with opportunities restricted

Pace: Messi darts away from De Jong and Ron Vlaar shortly before the former was substituted

Tight: Messi tries to make a move past the seemingly endless Dutch defenders

99 minutes: Messi doesn't seem to be moving too freely in extra time but Alejandro Sabella dare not take him off. He plays a short pass out to Rojo with the outside of his boot but the full back's cross goes well over.

100 minutes: A great run takes the little maestro away from Clasie in midfield but his pass to Sergio Aguero isn't great and the Manchester City man fails to control it.

- HALF TIME IN EXTRA TIME -

109 minutes: Messi's loose touch ruins any chance of an Argentina counter attack and the ball ends up with Stefan de Vrij shooting over the bar from 45 yards out.

116 minutes: Argentina's talisman does what only he can and creates something out of nothing. On the right wing he escapes two challenges and gets to the byline with Ron Vlaar grabbing at his shirt - even so he still crosses it but Maxi Rodriguez's connection isn't good enough and it's easily saved.
