With Thalasso therapy, aromatic massages and luxurious Dead Sea mud baths on offer, few of us would turn down the chance of a treatment at Raithwaite Hall in Yorkshire.

But these are no ordinary spa treatments. Instead, the relaxing packages, the cheapest of which costs £18, have been tailor-made for dogs.

Pampered pets can indulge in a basic 'Bath and Groom', which includes a spritz of perfume, a £35 Dead Sea Salt bath or even a full makeover that comes complete with a glamorous hair accessory.

Other options include a £60 'Premium Pamper' package that, in addition to a hair cut and condition, includes a 15-minute head and back massage.

Even puppies are covered thanks to the £18 'Puppy's First Groom' treatment, which is tailored to suit pooches aged four months and under.

Owners, meanwhile, have the run of the rest of the 19th century Raithwaite Hall, which is set on the spectacular 100-acre Raithwaite Estate, to enjoy as well as a spa of their own.

Once the home of a local shipping magnate, the Estate, which also includes seven new luxury stone cottages and an impressively large castle named The Keep, is close to Whitby and is famous for offering guests classic country pursuits.

As with the Dog Spa, which opens on the 17th January, canine guests are also welcome to enjoy the extensive grounds as well as sleep in one of the property's six dog 'lodges', which cost £60 per night.

And for pet fans who love their doggy companions almost as much as their other halves, the hotel is offering a special Valentine's Day package designed to give both man and dog a treat.

Included in the £60 Love Your Dog offer is a 'Premium Pamper' or 'Sparkling White' treatment for your pet, and a deluxe afternoon tea for two people at another Raithwaite Estate property, the Keep.

Relaxing: Dogs will also be able to share the experience with their owners thanks to a Valentines package

Deluxe: Afternoon tea at The Keep is included in the Valentines Love Your Dog pamper package
