A schoolgirl from Wales has become the first child in the world to be diagnosed with two different types of leukaemia.

Lauryn Robinson, seven, suffers from what doctors term as 'Dual Hit Leukaemia'. She suffers from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia as well as Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.

Doctors treating Lauryn at Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital are having to treat her cautiously because they have never seen a case like hers before. 

Lauryn Robinson is thought to be the only girl in the world suffering from Double Hit Leukaemia, meaning she is suffering from two different type of the disease. She needs a bone marrow donor to come forward urgently

Lauryn's mother Emma, 34, said: 'We had never even heard of Dual-Hit Leukaemia but that's what the doctors told us she has.

'Lauryn's condition is so rare that doctors are taking her treatment one step at a time - it is new ground for them.

'They are consulting with experts up and down the country because they've never seen this in a child before.'

Lauryn was classed as a fit and healthy seven-year-old until March this year when her parents noticed her face seemed swollen one day after school.

Dual Hit Leukaemia is the term used when a person develops two types of leukaemia at the same time.

It is incredibly rare and has only ever been recorded in a couple of hundred people in medical history.

It is estimated that the risk of developing the condition is one in two billion.

When her eyes became puffy and raised they took her to the family GP who referred her to hospital.

Tests were carried out and doctors diagnosed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia which affects hundreds of children every year.

However, the chemotherapy made her condition worse and caused Lauryn to suffer from seizures and a mini-stroke.

More tests were then carried out and doctors discovered only-child Lauryn also has Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, another type of leukaemia.

The chances of developing Double Hit Leukemia is so rare that it affects only one in two billion people.

Emma, 34, said: 'She's still really young so we've tried to protect her to some extent. But she knows that she is poorly and that she needs lots of rest and medicine to get better.'

Tests were carried out and doctors diagnosed Lauryn with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia which affects hundreds of children every year. But strangely, chemotherapy made her condition worse and caused Lauryn to suffer from seizures and a mini-stroke. sh was later diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma

Lauryn is undergoing treatment at Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital where her mum and dad Emma and Andrew, are keeping a bedside vigil.

Emma said: 'Lauryn has stayed so upbeat throughout her treatment.

'Our focus is getting her cancer into remission with chemo so that she's ready to receive a bone marrow transplant when the time comes.'

Lauryn has stayed upbeat throughout her treatment. Doctors want to get her cancer into remission with chemotherapy so that she can receive a bone marrow transplant when the time comes. They are desperately seeking donors

Emma and Andrew have both had their bone-marrow tested but neither is a match for Lauryn and there is no exact match for her on the worldwide bone marrow register.But the pair, from Mold, North Wales, are hoping that if more people sign up to the register a perfect match can be found.

School secretary Emma said: 'I wouldn't want to be anywhere but by my daughter's side.

'She
still smiles her way through every day. Me and her dad are so proud of 
our brave girl. Her dad works in the week but rushes to be with us 
evenings and weekends.

Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research said that only a couple of hundred cases worldwide have been reported in medical journals of adults being treated for dual-hit leukaemia-lymphoma. Lauryn, as a child, is a first

'All my energy is spent getting Lauryn better. She asks when she can do back to school and it breaks my heart that I don't know.

'We desperately need people to register as blood and bone marrow donors.

'If the word spreads far and wide enough
then hopefully, God willing, there will be a match for Lauryn and we 
can get back to normality.'

Ken Campbell, clinical information 
officer at Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research said: 'Only a couple of 
hundred cases worldwide have been reported in medical journals of adults
treated for dual-hit leukaemia-lymphoma.

Mother Emma said that Lauryn (pictured before becoming ill) keeps asking when she will be able to return to school and that it breaks her heart she cannot tell her when or if she will return

'To the best of our knowledge Lauryn is the first child ever to have been diagnosed with this incredibly rare type of blood cancer.'

Ann O'Leary, Head of Register Development for Anthony Nolan, said: 'A bone marrow transplant can be the last chance of survival for someone with blood cancer.

'But sadly we can only find a suitable donor for around half of those who need one.

'We urgently need more people to join the register and help give blood cancer patients like Lauryn the chance of a future.'
