Details regarding James Packer's $2 billion Sydney casino have been kept secret in a NSW Government report outlining how it  will be run.

Twelve pages and one key stakeholder agreement have been kept confidential by the author - The NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority- which claim their disclosure would be 'commercially damaging' to the operations of the casino licence.

Contained in the report are agreements between Packer's Crown Resorts and the NSW government, and the rules set out for the casino including who may enter, the types of games which may be played, minimum bet limits and tax rates.

Eight of the agreements between the parties were to be 'executed contemporaneously' when the casino licence was issued on July 8, but only seven of those have been made public in the 'VIP Gaming Management Agreement.' 

A considerable number of pages of the report have also been redacted or blacked-out.

Greens Upper House MP John Kaye has accused the NSW Government of 'moving into very dangerous territory' considering the latest ICAC investigations which resulted in the resignations of a number NSW Liberal MPs.

He said this latest report was another example of the Liberals doing 'doing more back-room deals with corporate donors and mates.' 

The Greens will move to subpoena the redacted information  during a sitting of parliament next week.

The NSW Government has decided to keep casino details public citing their disclosure would damage its license

'Next week, the Greens will be moving to subpoena the missing documents, using the upper House call-for-papers process,' he said.

'It will be up to the Labor Party and Fred Nile’s Christian Democrats to decide whether they support an open and accountable process or are happy to let the government cut side deals with an anonymous corporate entity.'

A NSW Independent Office Of Gaming spokesman has defended the confidential information, citing a lack of public interest.

He said its disclosure would subject the related parties to 'potential harm.'

'The information redacted in the VIP Gaming Management Agreement document would, in the view of the Authority, not promote the objects of the relevant Act and be commercially damaging to the licensee or related entities if released,' he said.

'It was the Authority’s view the public interest in its disclosure did not outweigh that potential harm.'

In July, Crown Resorts was granted a licence to operate a VIP-only restricted gaming facility, without poker machines, at Barangaro in Sydney.

It will begin operating on November 15, 2019 after the NSW government backed its proposal.
