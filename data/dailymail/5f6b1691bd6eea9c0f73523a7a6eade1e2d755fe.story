For the last six weeks, homeowners in one Oregon city have been under siege from vandals attacking their property and cars.

But rather than using spray paint or bricks to do damage, these bandits have taken a different approach by throwing donuts, yogurt and even potato salad.

The bizarre attacks include chocolate donuts spiked on the end of one woman's windscreen wipers, eggs and cakes thrown at a car bonnet, and pastries strewn across another woman's lawn along with a book from the 'Twilight' series.

Mysterious bakery bandits have targeted cars and houses in Hillboro, Oregon, throwing donuts, pastries, potato salad, yogurt and Maple bars at cars and houses

Lt. Mike Rouches, a Hillsboro police spokesman, told Oregon Live: 'In my 25 years in police services, I have never investigated or seen a criminal mischief involving pastries.'

Police first heard about the attacks on July 11 when a woman contacted them to say her flatmate and neighbours had been targeted at least 13 times.

She told officers that the crimes had all happened in and around the 5600 block of Northeast Farmcrest Street, Hillsboro, and had been going on since June 1.

She said Maple bars, cinnamon donuts, potato salad, pink yogurt and bread covered with a white 'slimy' liquid had all been thrown at her car.

Police discovered that, on several occasions, WinCo Foods or Albertsons packaging had been discovered at the scene of the attacks.

When they investigated three stores in the area they found that all of them stored their trash securely, meaning the items were bought or stolen from the shops, rather than the bins.

Officers investigating the attacks, which have been going on for six weeks, say they have taken place in and around the 5600 block of Northeast Farmcrest Street (pictured) between 11pm and 5am

Another woman contacted officers to say that on July 2 she found doughnuts in her yard along with an empty Albertsons box, while a 'Twilight' book was also left in her driveway.

On July 15 the same woman said that two chocolate donuts had been left spiked on the ends of the wiper blades of her son's car.

According to residents of Hillboro, all of the attacks have happened between 11pm and 5am.

So far the bakery bandit attacks have left officers stumped. Investigators believe the targets are selected at random and that youngsters are the likely culprits, but otherwise have no leads.

However, Rouches added: 'We'll solve it. It's just a matter of catching up with the bakery bandits.'
