Thousands of patients suffering major heart attacks and strokes are having to wait around 30 minutes for an ambulance to arrive, new  figures have revealed.

According to NHS rules, if a patient is suffering from an ‘immediately life-threatening’ problem then an ambulance should be on the scene within eight minutes.

These so-called ‘category-A calls’ include cardiac arrests, traumatic injuries, major strokes or serious breathing difficulties.

Statistics from England¿s ten ambulance services have shown that the target response time is not being met in an 'alarming' number of cases

But statistics from England’s ten ambulance services have shown that the target response time is not being met in an ‘alarming’ number of cases.

And the newly released figures show that response times have worsened over the past three years.

In April 2011, the slowest 1 per cent of category-A responses saw patients waiting for 23 minutes or more. But based on the slowest 1 per cent of  category-A responses in April this year, 28,000 critically ill patients a year are now waiting for an ambulance for 28 minutes or more.

The East of England Ambulance Service was the worst, with response times of 36 minutes or longer in the slowest 1 per cent of category-A cases, compared with 22 minutes or longer  at the neighbouring East Midlands Ambulance Service.

Shadow Health Minister Jamie Reed said lives were being put at risk by the delays, which he claimed stem from deep-seated problems in hospitals.

He said: ‘These alarming new figures raise real concerns that lives are being put at risk by the increasing chaos in the NHS. Too many ambulances are trapped in queues at overstretched A&Es, unable to hand over patients.

‘This, in turn, is leading to a worrying deterioration in ambulance response times across many regions of the  country. In life-threatening situations, every single second counts, and that is why this slump in standards simply cannot go on.’

A spokesman for NHS England, which has overall responsibility for ambulance services, said: ‘Nationally ambulance services have continued to perform well.

‘We know, however, that this is not the case everywhere, and our local commissioners are working with trusts to improve performance so that patients can get a fast, safe and high-quality service wherever they live.’
