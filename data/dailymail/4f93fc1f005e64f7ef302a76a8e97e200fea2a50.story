The British are happier than the French but more miserable than the Irish, an EU league table of happiness revealed yesterday.

It found that we are on a par with the Germans when we measure our satisfaction with life, and much more cheerful than those worst hit by the euro crisis, including Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece. 

Scandinavian countries ranked happiest, according to the table compiled by Eurostat, the EU’s statistics arm.

The British are happier than the French but more miserable than the Irish, an EU league table of happiness revealed yesterday

It was put out to mark today’s International Day of Happiness established by the UN and was based on answers to the question: ‘Overall, how satisfied are you with your life these days?’

Britons scored 7.3 out of ten – compared to a European average of 7.1 – but the Danes, Finns and Swedes all recorded an average satisfaction level of eight.

In Britain, the results of the surveys have shown that married people are happier than cohabitees or single people; that young people and the newly retired are happier than the squeezed middle-aged; and that we worry more about our health than most of the rest of the EU. 

They have also suggested that better-off people are happier than those who are poor. 

Ireland scored 7.4 to just pip Britain while the people of economically stagnant France rated seven. 

The Mediterranean countries came even lower, while Bulgarians were bottom of the table, recording a miserable 4.8.

The happiness league follows the introduction by Brussels of life satisfaction surveys which are carried out by national statistics ministries across the continent. 

Britain has been measuring the happiness of the population since 2010, when David Cameron backed the idea, saying it was as important to know about people’s well-being as to publish economic figures. 

The British surveys are costing taxpayers £2 million a year. 

Eurostat said yesterday: ‘Life satisfaction is a multi-dimensional concept, which is very much shaped by various socio-demographic factors which lead to different living situations as well as to different expectations and preferences.’

It said that broadly men and women were equally happy, and health was more important to people than money, work or friends.
