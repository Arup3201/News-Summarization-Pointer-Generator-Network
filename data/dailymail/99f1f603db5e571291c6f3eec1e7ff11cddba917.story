A federal agent charged with killing a man inside a McDonald's restaurant in Hawaii was released from police custody today after posting $250,000 bail.

Special agent Christopher Deedy, 27, is accused of fatally shooting 
23-year-old Kollin Elderts in the chest during a confrontation in the early hours of 
Saturday in Waikiki.

An official spokesman for the Department
of State confirmed to MailOnline today that Deedy was in Hawaii to protect 
U.S. dignitaries at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which will be attended by President Obama and the First Lady at the weekend.

Deedy, who is attached to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, was charged with second-degree murder and using a firearm in the commission of a felony.

Honolulu police said Deedy was released from jail at 5:15 am this morning. His first court appearance is scheduled for November 17.

Police spokesman Carolyn Sluyter said Mr Elderts, Deedy and two other men were involved in a confrontation at the restaurant when the shooting occurred after an earlier altercation at a nightclub.

Mr Elderts suffered a gunshot wound and was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Deedy was arrested at the scene, Ms Sluyter said. She did not identify the other two men.

Michael Green, an attorney for Mr 
Elderts' family, said the victim and Deedy didn't know each other and 
that Mr Elderts was unarmed.

Confrontation: The fatal shooting took place inside this McDonald's at 3am on Saturday morning in Waikiki

The shooting comes as security is ramped up in the area for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which starts tomorrow.

It was not immediately known who Deedy's attorney is.

President Obama and the First Lady are due to travel to Honolulu at the weekend for the APEC summit. 

Mr Eldert's family have hired attorney Michael Green who claims that Deedy followed the victim to the McDonald's at 3am.

The lawyer said the victim 'was in a club and got 
into a beef with a guy who turned out to be a federal agent. The guy 
followed him (Elderts) to McDonald's and shot him once in the chest'.

Mr Green did not know the name of the nightclub. He added: 'Nothing good happens at three o'clock.'

Mr Green told Hawaii News Now: ‘If you have a group of people, including this agent, at a bar or club, what’s the likelihood of all of them winding up at this McDonald’s shortly after that, before the club is closed? Someone apparently followed someone.’

He added: ‘He’s an agent of the federal government and my guess is he’s on duty 24 hours, just like our Honolulu Police Department people are.

‘And so there are some issues involved and there are some legal questions that have to be answered.’

The attorney said that a blood alcohol test was likely to take place.

'We can't wait to see those test results,' he added.

Mr Green said he was in the process of tracking any surveillance videos from the McDonald’s and surrounding businesses.

Mr Elderts, 23, was a graduate of Kalaheo High School in Kailua.

His criminal record consisted of a 2008 disorderly conduct violation, for which he was ordered to pay $150 and a 2010 petty misdemeanor for operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant, for which he paid a $300 fine.
