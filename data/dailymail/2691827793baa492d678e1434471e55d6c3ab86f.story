A jailed sex offender says he's tired of being linked to the 1979 disappearance of a New York City boy whose case helped mobilize a nationwide missing-children movement.

Jose Ramos was for years the prime suspect in the disappearance of six-year-old Etan Patz. Authorities believe the boy was abducted off the street in SoHo and later murdered.

Another man, Pedro Hernandez, has since been charged in Patz's death and faces trial, but a civil court once held Ramos responsible. He denies involvement.

Etan Patz disappeared when he was six years old from a street in Soho, New York City in 1979

Ramos sent a letter this week to The Citizens' Voice newspaper in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania to complain about media coverage linking him to Patz, his attorneys and the Luzerne County court system.

He calls himself an 'ex-sex offender and not a sex offender'.

Ramos completed a 27-year sentence last year on molestation charges. He's jailed on Megan's Law charges.

Pedro Hernandez, confessed last year to strangling Patz in the basement of a SoHo bodega in 1979.

Ramos' connection to Patz is through one of the boy's babysitters, who was friends with Ramos. Shortly after Patz's disappearance, Ramos was convicted of multiple counts of child molestation and served a 27-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania.

At the time of his arrest, authorities found dozens of photos in the drainpipe where Ramos had been living of young boys who all had a strong resemblance to Patz.

While incarcerated, a jailhouse 
snitch told authorities that Ramos had confessed to him that he knew 
what happened to Patz. However, it wasn't enough evidence for 
prosecutors to pursue charges.

Despite
no criminal charges, the Patz family sued Ramos in civil court, where 
he was found to have been responsible for the boy's death.

The Patz family was awarded a ceremonial $2million, which they never attempted to collect.

The Etan Patz case was reopened last year with the FBI investigating a Soho basement

Ramos, 70, is currently in a Pennsylvania prison for failing to register as a sex offender after serving a 27-year prison sentence. He in the Luzerne County Correctional Facility being held on $75,000Â  bail.

The child molester has repeatedly denied involvement in Patz's disappearance.

Hernandez, who was arrested in May, 2012 - after Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance re-opened the Patz case - when family members told authorities that he admitted to killing Patz.

At the time of Patz's disappearance, Hernandez worked in a bodega just blocks from the boy's home.

Prosecutors may be forced to throw out the case against Hernandez - who is both schizophrenic and suffering from bipolar disorder - due to a lack of evidence.
