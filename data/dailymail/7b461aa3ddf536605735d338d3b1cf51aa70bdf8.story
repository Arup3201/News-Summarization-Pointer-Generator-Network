It is doubtful that many visitors to West Sussex – attracted, perhaps, by horse-racing at Glorious Goodwood or polo at Cowdray Park – give West Chiltington a second glance.

They probably mark it down as just another quaint, chocolate-box village, full of 17th Century cottages, where nothing more exciting than the WI fete ever disturbs the peace.

But they’d be wrong. For this is a place where all is not as it seems. For one thing, every house in one 50-acre patch of the village is an ingenious fake. West Chiltington was also the scene of a Royal intrigue.

On the market: A six-bedroom '17th Century' cottage in West Chiltington, West Sussex, is on sale for £1.5m

Far from being centuries-old, the 70 archetypal country cottages in the village were all built in the 1920s, the work of Reginald Fairfax Wells, a bohemian potter and eccentric who professed a love of the more simple things in life.

While most builders of the period constructed new homes with slate roofs and light interiors, Wells built his with thatched roofs and walls of whitewashed slurry. The rooms were small with tiny windows, water came from outside wells, and he eschewed modern plumbing.

Curiously, these cottages sold like hot cakes, snapped up as weekend boltholes by Wells’s chums in London. The locals, meanwhile, thought Wells quite mad. When the thatch on some of his cottages caught fire, they stood around laughing.

As for the Royal link, it was in one of these so-called Wells cottages – Meadowbrook – that Princess Margaret carried out a bizarre love affair. By 1967, her marriage to Lord Snowdon was foundering.

In February that year, Snowdon went to Japan and Margaret visited Robin Douglas-Home, an aristocrat and nightclub pianist who had previously been married to Sandra Howard. She is now the wife of former Tory leader Michael Howard.

Big home: Old Oaks is two separate cottages which is connected through a corridor

Described by The Times as ‘a harmless loon with a slight but well-bred talent to amuse’, Douglas-Home is said to have played the piano to Margaret at Meadowbrook in the nude.

Today, the episode is seldom mentioned. However, Wells cottages are a subject on every estate agent’s lips. Once seen as follies, they have now all been lavishly updated and scores of would-be buyers wait patiently for one to come on the market.

Old Oaks – the one that Reginald Wells built for himself – is one such property, currently for sale for £1.5 million. Typically, there is a story behind it.

‘What you have here is actually two cottages,’ says owner Anne Duke, 68, a retired head teacher as she shows me around.

‘Wells lived here with his wife, Resca, but they fell out. Rather than split up, he built another cottage for her, which is joined to the main house by a corridor, so they lived together, yet apart.’

When Anne and her partner, Dudley Broster, 75, moved into Old Oaks seven years ago, it was in a rather sorry state.

There was an ancient shag-pile carpet in the hall, where old-fashioned regency striped wallpaper covered every surface, including the cupboards. The kitchen was dark thanks to its low ceiling, and there was a 1970s-style brown suite in the bathroom.

The couple undertook a seven-month renovation project costing about £50,000. In the kitchen, the oak units were repainted, granite worktops were installed, and a roof lantern was then added to make the room much lighter.

The entrance hall was made bright and cheerful, the beamed drawing room was smartened up, and instead of a labyrinth of small rooms upstairs, the layout was reconfigured to make a logical spread of six bedrooms, four with en suite bathrooms.

Both Anne and Dudley have been married before, and the house is big enough for their four children and ten grandchildren when they visit. Indeed, last year, they managed to entertain 25 friends and family on Boxing Day.

There is a twinkling swimming pool outside, but Anne’s favourite spot is undoubtedly the terrace overlooking the lawn.

‘This has been carefully sited to get the sun from the east at coffee time in the morning and again when it’s time for evening G&Ts,’ she says with a smile.

‘Reginald Wells was not the fool everyone thought he was.’
