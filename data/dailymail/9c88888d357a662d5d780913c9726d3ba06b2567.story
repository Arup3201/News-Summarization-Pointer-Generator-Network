Like this, just a bit smaller: The iPad Mini may bring an eight-inch tablet to the table

Apple are looking at launching an 'iPad Mini' later this year, bringing an eight-inch younger brother into the fold, according to a rumour from a well-placed source.

Apple are notoriously secretive about upcoming products, but this leak comes from inside Samsung, a company which holds the unique position of being Apple's fiercest competitor - and one of their biggest hardware suppliers.

The source from within Samsung made the 'mini' indescretion while talking to the Korea Times about how Apple spends £7billion on Samsung components, which go into Apple's iPhones, iPads and MacBooks.

The leaky official said: 'The amount of the current contract [between Apple and Samsung] is around $9.7billion.

'The contract is expected to rise to $11billion by the end of this 
year as Apple is planning to release a smaller iPad, probably with a 
7.85-inch screen, and to sell more of its MacBook Air PCs using 
Samsung’s faster solid state drive (SSD) storage.'

The iPad Mini would add variety to 
Apple's one-size-fits-all approach, and would be more portable. It will 
also show that Apple is prepared to break away from former chief exec 
Steve Jobs' deeply-held mantras.

The Apple leader, who passed away last October, publicly derided the smaller tablet model, in particular the seven-inch form-factor, which is becoming a standard for a smaller tablet.

In a 2010 earnings call, he said: 'One naturally thinks that a seven-inch screen would offer 70 percent of 
the benefits of a ten-inch screen.

'Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. … The reason we won't make a seven-inch tablet isn’t because we don’t want to hit a 
lower price point, it’s because we think the screen is too small to 
express the software.'

Not a fan: Steve Jobs, father of the iPad, said a seven-inch tablet did not offer the best experience

However a segment of the market is 
likely to disagree with Jobs, particularly with the rise of the eBook reader and 
Android tablets which come in all shapes and sizes.

Consumers like commuters and travellers 
will find the size (almost) pocket-friendly, and Google are likely to 
lead the mainstream acceptance of smaller tablets when they bring out 
their own seven-inch Android tablet before the summer.

On the other hand, the risk to Apple 
is that a different-sized tablet might lead to fragmentation - where 
apps and games need re-configuring by their developers to ensure they 
are compatible on both versions.

This has been Android's biggest issue in the last few years.

Different screen sizes, different 
manufacturers, different versions of the operating system and different
price-points all lead to choice for the consumer - but at the cost of 
development headaches and an inconsistent experience.

Indeed, one Indie developer, Mika 
Mobile, decided to stop supporting Android this week, stating Android 
was costing them so much in tweaking that it was swallowing all 
their profits.

Apple has avoided all these problems 
so far by keeping full ownership of the product line, and keeping a uniform 
screen size for their two big ranges, iPhones and iPad. The only major 
fragmentation that occurs is as older models become obsolete.

Samsung has a full complement of phones and tablets to compete with Apple, such as the five-inch Note

Samsung is a very strange bed-fellow of Apple.

To the consumers, they are 
arch-rivals, with the Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphone competing directly 
with the iPhone and being the runaway success of Android in the last 
year.

In the courts the fighting is even 
more fierce, with Apple repeatedly trying - and sometimes succeeding - 
in getting injunctions to stop Samsung selling phones and tablets around
the world, claiming patent infrigement.

But in business, Samsung is one of 
Apple's top suppliers - and Apple will spend up to £7billion on Samsung 
parts for their products this year, according to the Samsung leak.

The leak also said the 
amount is expected to increase until at least 2014 under the current 
terms of their contract, following a deal between Samsung and Apple's 
CEO Tim Cook.

The Korea Times also said that Apple 
bought around £4.9billion worth of parts from Samsung in 2011 including 
displays, mobile application processors, NAND flash chips and mobile 
memory.

You will find Samsung processors, displays and memory chips inside the new iPad.

The
source continued: 'Apple’s top management still believes Samsung is the
only parts maker in the world ideally-positioned to meet all of the 
critical conditions - better pricing, technologically-enhanced products,
on-time delivery and the capability to immediately respond to any 
emergency situation.'

However one thing Apple may not like 
is the lack of discretion, as they plan the hype and launch of their new
products down to the smallest details.

The source also said that Samsung's 
OLED panel supplies - the type which power Samsung's top-range 
smartphones - may appear in future iDevices, if Samsung is able to 
output the screens in high-enough quantities.

Apple's much-admired 'Retina' displays are also manufactured by Samsung.

Also on the rumour mill today are 
suggestions that Apple's anticipated television set - the iTV - will 
launch towards the end of the year.

Analyst Peter Misek said yesterday 
that panel suppliers are gearing up to begin production in May or 
June,and therefore the television may launch in the few months leading 
up to Christmas.

Apple has played in the TV market 
before, with Apple TV working like a set-top box to pump videos to 
flat-screens.

But with the tech built inside, and Apple's respected 
attention to detail and usability, the TV industry may be in for a bit 
of a revolution, as Apple did before for the music, movie, TV and phone 
industries.
