West Ham duo Mark Noble and James Tomkins had to be dragged apart by team-mate Kevin Nolan after scrapping during an enthralling FA Cup tie with Everton on Tuesday night.

The pair clashed during the Hammers' victory at Upton Park, as they trailed 2-1 in extra-time.

Noble seemed to be criticising Tomkins after he failed to deal with a Romelu Lukaku breakaway in the previous attack, and the defender reacted furiously.

As tempers raised on an enthralling evening in east London, Nolan was on hand to break up the fight. His intervention meant no action was needed from the referee. 

And Hammers manager Sam Allardyce played down the incident afterwards. 

'It was handbags,' Allardyce reasoned. 'They're such big buddies you'd find it difficult for them but they must've been passionate about something. Obviously one opinion was disagreed by the other one.

'I don't know what it was but there's no doubt it will not hang over us after we've won.'

Of course, it's not the first time team-mates have clashed in English football.

Newcastle pair Kieron Dyer and Lee Bowyer were sent off for fighting each other during a game against Aston Villa in 2005, and were later made to issue a shamefaced apology by then manager Graeme Souness. 

The match however did finish on a positive note for the hosts after the match ended 2-2, with goalkeeper Adrian netting the winning penalty to seal a 9-8 shoot-out victory.
