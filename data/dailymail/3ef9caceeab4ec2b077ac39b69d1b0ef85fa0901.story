The scheduled Wednesday execution of a convicted cop killer that would have used up the state's last dose of a lethal injection drug has been halted by the highest criminal appeals court in Texas.

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled to stop the scheduled execution of 55-year-old Randall Wayne Mays late on Monday. 

Mays was convicted of murder after a shootout in 2007 left Henderson County Sheriff's Office Investigator Paul Steven Habelt and Deputy Tony Price Ogburn dead.

Randall Wayne Mays, 55, was due to be executed on Wednesday but a Texas appeals court put a stop to it 

Mays' punishment would have used up the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's last does of pentobarbital

The death chamber where executions take place is located in the Walls Unit in downtown Huntsville, Texas

The court agreed with Mays' lawyers that additional review is needed to determine if he is mentally competent for execution.

His punishment would have used up the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's last dose of pentobarbital.

The drug is used for lethal injections and it is now difficult to obtain for capital punishment.

Thanks to the delay, Texas has enough pentobarbital for its next scheduled execution on April 9.

The state has at least three other executions on the calendar for April.

Mays was going to receive a lethal injection. The delay means Texas' next execution can go on as planned

As a result of this order, Mays' case will be sent back to Henderson County.

An expert will need to determine whether he's competent to receive the death penalty.  

The Eighth Amendment bars the execution of a person who does not understand that his execution is imminent and does not understand why he are being executed.

The state believes Mays was aware of the execution and why it was going to happen.  

Texas prison officials, like those in other death penalty states, have found it increasingly difficult to find suppliers to provide drugs intended for capital punishment use. 

The state's penultimate portion of pentobarbital was used in the execution of a Mexican hit man who was convicted of beating and strangling a San Antonio woman.

Manuel Vasquez killed the woman because she didn't pay a ten per cent tax on her illegal drug sales.

Vasquez was executed on March 11 and he was the fourth Texas inmate put to death this year.
