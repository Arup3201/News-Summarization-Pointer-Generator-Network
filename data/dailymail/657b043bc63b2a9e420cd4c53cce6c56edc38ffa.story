British soldiers have taken part in a secret offensive against the Taliban in a deadly Afghan warzone they had pulled out from three years ago.

About 80 members of the 4th Battalion The Rifles provided ‘assistance’ to an Afghan National Army purge of insurgents in the hotspot of Sangin, in which 12  fanatics were killed and 30 improvised explosive devices seized.

There were no British casualties during the eight-day operation earlier this month, but two Afghan soldiers died.

The mission to prevent Sangin,  northern Helmand, again becoming a Taliban stronghold was considered so risky it had to be approved personally by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.

From 2006 to 2010 when UK troops were based in the town, dubbed one of the world’s most dangerous places, 106 soldiers were killed.

News of the operation will fuel concerns about Afghan troops’ ability to defeat the Taliban when UK, US and Nato forces pull out in December 2014.

The Afghan army took over security in Sangin in the spring but military commanders requested assistance following weeks of attacks by insurgents.

Mr Hammond gave permission for troops from 4 Rifles, serving as the Brigade Advisory Group, to travel from Camp Bastion and help as troops from the UK-mentored 3/215 Brigade moved in.

The UK troops have since left Sangin.

A senior Army officer said: ‘The negative publicity would have been worse if the situation around Sangin had got out of hand. This was the lesser of many evils.’

The Ministry of Defence said: ‘These 
out-of-area operations are completely in line with our current role of 
providing training, advice and assistance to the Afghan National 
Security Forces.’

In recent months the British Armed 
Forces have instead been focusing on mentoring the Afghan National Army 
in preparation for their withdrawal from the country next year.

'In support of the Afghan forces who 
now have the security lead across the country, UK personnel do on 
occasion operate outside the usual UK area of operations in central 
Helmand in an advisory capacity, ' the Ministry of Defence said in a 
statement.

The statement added that Sangin 'remains a challenging area' and it is now for the Afghan forces to deal with insurgents.

During the operation, a number of insurgents were detained and killed, more than 30 improvised explosive devices were found and destroyed and two vehicles were seized along with ammunition and weapons.

There were no British casualities but a number of ANA soldiers were killed, The Sunday Times added.

Brigadier Rupert Jones, Commander Task Force Helmand, said: 'We have known for some considerable time that 3/215 Brigade of the Afghan National Army, who Task Force Helmand has operated with for many years, is a highly effective fighting formation. Through the summer they have just got better and better as ISAF have stepped back further.

'However, operating in Sangin over the past week, they have moved to another level of performance and independence.

'Everyone who witnessed them has been in awe of the manner in which they cleared the insurgents from well defended positions with integrated fire support, manoeuvre, reserves and strong tactics.

'They have operated virtually independently, requiring the Task Force Helmand advisors from 4 RIFLES for little more than casualty evacuation.

'It has been a very impressive demonstration of what the Afghan National Army can be capable of.'
