A £9.3million mansion is being sold for a hefty discount to clear the debts of its owner, who allegedly stole cash from his own private equity firm.

The Grade II-listed Cotswolds manor house, near Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, is now on the market for £6.95million to clear owner Adrian Burford’s debts.

In the brochure the home is shown with high-end decorations and fixtures, but the property now appears to be stripped bare.

In June the High Court heard he stole cash from private equity investment company Fern Advisors Ltd, which is now reportedly suing the former £240,000-a-year chief executive director in an effort to get the money back.

It is alleged he spent the cash, taken between January last year and March this year, on the home, as well as £1.1 million on London restaurant Sushinho in which he owned shares, £925,000 to 'prop up a company' he was director of, Westover Medical, and a further £460,000 on another company.

Burford, who is married and has three young children, then bought £20,000 worth of fine wines from a company he was involved in and a number of luxury cars including an Aston Martin and a Range Rover Discovery 4, it is said.

The house is being sold on the instructions of the court receiver

A High Court Judge has granted injunctions against Burford and his assets have apparently been frozen.

A further hearing is scheduled for November 7, and the house is being sold on the instructions of the court receiver.

'When receivers sell property they tend to want a very fast sale which has probably influenced the asking price of this house,' said an Evening Standard source.

Broadwell Manor has eight bedrooms and has 'all the features of a classic country house' including a flat for staff, four cottages and stables.

Burford was not available for comment.
