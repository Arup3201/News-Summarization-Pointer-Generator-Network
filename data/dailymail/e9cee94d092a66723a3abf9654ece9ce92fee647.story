A catalogue of police failings allowed a sadistic killer to murder his ex-partner and daughter, an investigation has found.

Officers took 'inadequate action' to arrest David Oakes, 50, before he shot Christine Chambers, 38, and Shania, two, at their home in Braintree, Essex, the police watchdog concluded.

Oakes, of Steeple, near Maldon, was given two whole-life jail terms after being found guilty of the murders, which happened in June last year.

Sadistic: The Independent Police Complaints Commission found police took 'inadequate action' to arrest former nightclub bouncer David Oakes. He is pictured, left, in a police photograph taken prior to him murdering Christine Chambers and daughter Shania, and, right, baring his injured face last year after shooting himself following the savage killings

It emerged during his trial at 
Chelmsford Crown Court that police had visited either his address or 
Miss Chambers' home six times in the two years before the murders.

The trial heard that Oakes stormed Ms
Chambersâ€™ house and blasted her and their daughter Shania with a 
shotgun just weeks after the family gained a restraining order against 
him.

He then shot himself in the face, but survived.

The court heard that Oakes 'systematically tortured' Ms Chambers for several hours before the killings, forcing her to strip and cutting chunks from her hair.

Ms Chambers' 10-year-old daughter fled the house during the ordeal as police outside attempted to negotiate with the killer.

The couple, who had a long history of domestic abuse, were due to appear at a court custody hearing the next day.

A damning report released today by 
the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) concludes that Essex
Police missed chances to arrest Oakes before the killings.

The IPCC investigation found a lack 
of adequate training, insufficient resources allocated to domestic 
violence cases and poor oversight by the force.

It said inadequate action was taken 
to arrest Oakes at the earliest opportunity when reports were made of 
him breaching a non-molestation order.

Killed: Christine Chambers and her daughter Shania were murdered at their Essex home in June 2011

A catalogue of incidents involving 
the couple reported to police over a two-year period were treated in 
isolation by officers.

The force failed to take into 
consideration the possibility that Ms Chambers had not pursued 
complaints against Oakes because she was scared of him, the 
investigation found.

Ms Chambers made a higher number of 
calls to police in the two months before the murders, but the force 
failed to respond properly, the report stated.

Ms Chambers' father Ken praised Essex Police for its support during the murder investigation but said he felt the force could have done more to prevent the deaths.

He said: 'As a family we would again like to say thank you to all those, including friends and neighbours, who have shown us such support and kindness since the murders of Christine and Shania.

'We have also received marvellous support from the police murder investigation team led by Detective Chief Inspector O'Toole, from police family liaison officers and the victim support service, and we are grateful to all of them for helping us through such a traumatic time.

'We have been kept informed by the IPCC of their investigation and findings and have had opportunity to read through and discuss their report.

'We realise one evil man is responsible for taking Christine and Shania away from us and not having them in our lives any more remains extremely difficult to bear.

'While we understand at times Christine could have been more cooperative with the police, we do feel that Essex Police could have done more to prevent the deaths; they should have taken greater steps to protect Christine.

'Difficult to bear': Christine Chambers' father Ken, pictured with the victim's mother Jean during the trial, praised Essex Police for its support during the murder investigation but said he felt the force could have done more to prevent the deaths

'For instance, we are still of the view she should have had a panic alarm installed at her home which may have allowed her to summon assistance at a crucial time after her phones had been smashed.

'And we think that officers dealing with ongoing incidents should have been more aware of the history and should have better identified the risks.'

The IPCC said that, while individual 
officers could have done things better, it was a failure of police 
systems rather than of individuals.

IPCC Commissioner Rachel Cerfontyne said: 'The deaths of Christine and Shania Chambers are shocking to us all.

'It is impossible to say with any 
certainty whether if individual officers or the force had done things 
differently, Ms Chambers and Shania would still be alive today.

'While individual police officers 
could and should have done things better, this is not essentially a 
failure of individuals, but a failure of systems.

'The investigation identified a lack 
of adequate training, insufficient resources allocated to domestic 
violence cases and poor oversight.

Murdered: Christine Chambers and her daughter, Shania, two, were shot dead at close range with a shotgun

'This is a tragic and disturbing case
and the investigation has identified several key issues which apply to 
many other cases where domestic homicide is the outcome.

'Many women are reluctant to pursue criminal proceedings against abusive partners, sometimes even to seek help at all.

'There are many reasons for this, and
often it is fear that they will exacerbate the situation and increase 
the danger they face.

'Undoubtedly this poses significant 
challenges for the police and other agencies, but it is essential in 
these situations that all possible is done to protect the victims and 
their children.

'Unwillingness to seek help or give 
evidence against the perpetrator is often due to fear and can be a sign 
of vulnerability, not culpability, and this must be recognised when a 
risk assessment is completed.'

Responding to the report, which was 
released today, Essex Police said it accepted the findings and 
apologised for the failings which had been identified.

Assistant
Chief Constable Maurice Mason said: 'On behalf of everyone at Essex 
Police, I extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of 
Christine and Shania Chambers, who were brutally murdered by David Oakes
in the early hours of June 6, 2011.

'Essex Police accepts the findings of the IPCC report, and apologises for the failures identified there.

'Every
police officer involved in the case of Christine and Shania is 
devastated by their passing. I too am devastated by their deaths. I 
became a police officer to protect the vulnerable, and to put criminals 
like Oakes behind bars.

'Essex Police is committed to working tirelessly to reduce the likelihood of tragedies such as this from occurring again.'

He
added: 'The unbelievable inhumanity of these murders led Oakes to be 
sentenced to two whole-life prison terms - the most extreme punishment 
which the British judicial system can impose.

'You
would think that a man capable of such horror would have a history of 
violence. Oakes did not: he had no convictions or cautions for violence.

Murder weapon: The shotgun used by David Oakes to kill his partner and their two-year-old daughter

'In fact, the IPCC has found that significant 'information concerning Oakes's violence towards Christine Chambers was not available to the police or social services.

'The IPCC also stated that there was no information that Oakes had access to a firearm.

'Essex Police acts promptly and decisively whenever it receives credible intelligence about illegally-held weapons.

'Essex Police accepts the report of the IPCC and welcomes the recommendation that processes should be developed for better information sharing between police forces and agencies such as social services, courts and solicitors.

'This is particularly important in cases involving child custody proceedings, where allegations of domestic violence have not been reported to officers.

'It should be stressed that the IPCC investigation found that it is impossible to say with any certainty that, if the force had done things differently, Christine and Shania would be alive today.

'It also found no evidence of misconduct by any of our officers.'

Earlier this year, Essex Police apologised for its failings in a chillingly similar murder case.

The force was reprimanded for its handling of the murder of Maria Stubbings - who was killed by her ex-partner in 2008.

Maria, 50, was strangled to death with a dog lead in her Chelmsford home by convicted killer Marc Chivers just days after she had phoned Essex Police saying she was in danger.

An IPCC report into Maria's murder concluded that the mother-of-two's death was 'predictable and preventable' and that she had been 'badly let down' by police.

Ms Stubbings had phoned police to say she suspected Chivers had tried to break into her home, but the incident was not logged as domestic violence and was there not given a high priority.
