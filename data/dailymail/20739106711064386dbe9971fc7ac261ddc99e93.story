Vibrant graffiti and frescoes uncovered during a restoration of the Colosseum in Rome have revealed the arena, famed for its bloody gladiator battles, was a far more colourful place than had previously been thought.

Traces of red, black, green and blue frescoes, as well as graffiti and drawings of phallic symbols, were found in the 1st century building's only intact internal passageway which sits between the second and third levels.

The findings paint an all together different appearance than the monochrome grey and red brick that archeologists had previously imagined for the famous 50,000-seat amphitheatre.

Find: Brightly coloured fragments of frescoes were found during a restoration of a passageway inside the Colosseum

The findings were part of a long-delayed restoration of Rome's Colosseum

They show that while the exposed seating area was 
covered in white marble, the insides, the galleries, all the corridors 
and transverse hallways were completely colored.

Huge amounts of calcified rock and dirt 
had hidden the frescoes, which were finally revealed during the cleaning and 
restoration project, which began in November. 

Among the finds was a red palm frond and a picture of a crown believed to have been drawn by a gladiator fan as he or she passed through the passageway.

Another restored section has images of a phallus, which officials said was commonly drawn for good luck. The Latin word 'VIND', referring to victory or revenge, was also found.

Colosseum director Rosella Rea said less than one per cent of the painted surfaces of the Colosseum remain.

She said: 'We need to imagine a building with extreme contrasts of color. This was a surprise.

'Many of the splashes of color are covered with layers of more recent graffiti. "Ricciu" signed his name there with the date 1943. "Maria" and "Filippo" did as well. Someone else left some drawings in 1620.'

Officials say the scrawlings probably 
date from the 3rd century, after the Colosseum was restored following a 
fire in A.D. 217. but some may be even earlier.

The passageway, which will be open to the public later on this year, leads to the highest level of seating - a wooden gallery reserved for the lowest classes and furthest 
from the action in the arena.

It was built between 72 and 80 AD and was originally used for gladiator contests, and re-enacting sea battles.

It was the largest ever built in the Roman Empire, and was constructed of concrete and stone.

In its heyday it could seat 50,000 spectators on three tiers of seating.

The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era.

It was then used for a variety of purposes, including housing and and a Christian shrine.

The exterior of the building is visited by millions of tourists each year.

'We're used to thinking that during excavations, archaeological surprises are a risk for builders and for the city's development,' said Rome archaeological heritage superintendent Mariarosaria Barbera.

'This is a beautiful archaeological surprise Even in a monument as well known as this one, studied all over the world, there are still new things to discover.'

Aside from the hallway cleaning, the Colosseum is set to undergo €25 million ($33.31 million) head-to-toe restoration funded by Italian businessman Diego Della Valle, founder of the Tod's shoe empire.

The effort is primarily designed to shore up the monument, one of the world's most famous, which is crumbling under years of neglect.

Asked how such details could have gone undetected for nearly 2,000 years, officials said flatly: money.

There simply wasn't funding available to carry out the restoration of the passageway, which Rea said had been a goal for her office for 20 years.

Pieces of masonry and rock have fallen from the rafters, and the travertine is covered in gray dirt from car exhaust and pollution.

The traces confirmed that while the Colosseum today is a fairly monochrome colour, it used to have halls decked in colour

The nearby subway rattles its 
foundations, such that the Colosseum has begun sinking in the same way 
the Leaning Tower of Pisa does, with a 40-centimeter (nearly 16-inch) 
inclination on its south side.

'It's not serious, but it needs to be
restored,' Rea said, noting the last major restoration was carried out 
in the 1970s. 'The later you start, the worse it is.'

Work has been delayed because of 
court challenges to the contract bidding process, with the latest 
hearing this week put off until the end of the month.

While intriguing, none of the 
fragments restored so far rival the gorgeous frescoes found in other 
nearby ruins of the Roman Forum, such as the 6th century biblical scenes
in the Santa Maria Antiqua church. But officials stressed that they are
nevertheless remarkable because they give a very different impression 
of what the Colosseum must have looked like in its heyday.
