Distraught: Navpreet Walia, 40, burned his estranged wife's £68,000 estate, the Court of Appeal heard

A widower who set fire to his estranged wife's £68,000 estate after she died of cancer is being sued by her new lover for a share of the cash.

Navpreet Walia, 40, could be left homeless after he 'literally burned' the cash in a fit of grief, in a case which has been compared to Charles Dickens' tragic courtroom drama Bleak House.

Mr Walia's wife Jocelyn was 38 when she died of cancer without leaving a will.

That meant Mr Walia, from Thornton-Cleveleys, Lancashire, automatically inherited everything she owned despite her leaving him several years earlier for a new partner.

When she died her 'articulate and intelligent' husband was so upset that he drew out tens of thousands of pounds in cash and torched it all, a court heard.

The assets included her half
share of a £130,000 life insurance policy and the equity in the home 
the couple once shared.

Her new partner, Felipe Lim, claimed he and Mrs Walia's two children were entitled to a share of the estate and sued him last year at Manchester High Court, which ruled all three were entitled to 'reasonable provision'.

Mr Walia appeared to fight that ruling yesterday at London's Court of Appeal, where details of the case were aired for the first time.

Simon Charles, for Mr Lim and the 
children, said: 'It has been admitted frankly that the money has been 
burnt. This is conduct that one should bear in mind when considering 
whether to grant Mr Walia the indulgence which he seeks.'

Mr Charles accepted bank records tallied with Mr Walia's story but added: 'My
clients have some difficulty accepting that the money has gone.

'Mr 
Walia says the money has been burnt. If the money has been burnt, it 
doesn’t stop a judgment being entered against other assets held by Mr 
Walia.'

Lord Justice Davis gave Mr Walia 
permission to appeal - on condition that he signs a 
sworn statement within ten days 'giving details of exactly how, where and when the 
money was literally burnt.'

The judge added: 'This is a relatively 
modest estate. All this has turned this family tragedy into a modern day
version of Jarndyce and Jarndyce.

'Mr
Walia has suffered significant bereavements in the last year or so; not
only his wife had died but [other family members] have been lost.

'There
is some evidence he has been suffering from a significant depressive 
illness [although] he is clearly an articulate and intelligent man.'

The judge's allusion to 'Jarndyce and Jarndyce' was a reference to Bleak House, Charles Dickens' masterpiece story of a family at war.

The case was compared to warring family members in Dickens' Bleak House (pictured in a BBC version)

The fictional family battled so bitterly over a relative's will that by the time a judge decided who should win the money, it had been completely swallowed in lawyers' fees.

The court heard Mr and Mrs Walia wed in July 2003 and had a 
daughter, Emma, now eight, before Mrs Walia left their home in Lancaster to form a new relationship.

She moved in with her new partner Mr Lim and had her son Philip, now four.

Describing the case as 'somewhat unusual', Mr Walia’s counsel, Neil Vickery, told the judge that the widower could lose his home if he has to pay back the burnt cash.

When asked if he had burnt the money because he was upset at his wife’s death, Mr Walia said outside court: 'Yes, I was more than upset, but I don’t want to say any more about it at the moment. I’ll put it all down in the affidavit for the judge.'

If Mr Walia does not file the affidavit within the 10-day deadline, his appeal will automatically be dismissed.
