Wearing a pork pie hat and riding in a pushchair along the tarmac of a Marshall Islands airport, Jose Alvarenga, the 'miracle survivor of the Pacific' began the long journey home today.

And while his flight home was to take more than 24 hours, it is considerably shorter than the almost 14 months he spent drifting across the world's largest ocean.

Accompanied by a burly El Salvadorian diplomat, 37-year-old Alvarenga was given a window seat at the very front of the economy section, where he slumped down in a deliberate attempt to be photographed by other passengers who learned of his fame.

Precious cargo: Jose Alvarenga is wheeled onto the United Airlines flight home in the early hours of this morning

Real life castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga has crossed the Pacific again - but this time in a plane. He is pictured in the airport lounge, ready to leave for home

The fisherman washed ashore late last month in the Marshall Islands after spending more than a year drifting across the ocean living on what he could catch

Mr Alvarenga's arrival time at Majuro's Amata Kabua International Airport had been kept secret. At the last moment, however, the republic's President Christopher Loeak chose to give a brief photo opportunity in the airport's VIP lounge

For
 the evening meal on the four and a half hour flight from the Marshall 
Islands to Honolulu he was given a choice of grilled chicken and 
vegetables or lasagne and vegetables.

He
 chose lasagne - possibly because it was the closest to his favourite 
tortilla, the central American meal that he cried out for when he first 
struck land nearly two weeks ago.

That was followed by fruit salad, cookies from the island nation of Guam, and accompanied by a soft drink and water.

As
 the United Airlines jet soared across the Pacific, Alvarenga did not 
bother looking out of the window at the ocean he had so painfully 
crossed in his open boat - because it was dark there was nothing to see.

So
 he dozed most of the way and airline staff ensured he was not bothered 
by passengers curious to learn more about his extraordinary adventure.

But he told a passenger as the flight landed that he had enjoyed his first 'ride' in an aeroplane.

His
 immediate plans on landing in Honolulu were not known but he has told 
his minders in the Marshal Islands that he is looking forward to once 
again greeting the family he has not seen for 15 years since he fled El 
Salvador after a brutal bar-room dispute.

But now the 37-year-old El Salvadorian, who looks remarkably healthier than the bloated and bedraggled figure who hit headlines two weeks ago, is heading back to his family, who have not seen him for 15 years after he fled to Mexico following a brutal bar-room brawl

It was claimed that before moving to Mexico, Mr Alvarenga belonged to a guerrilla army in his native El Salvador, where he was trained in jungle warfare

Doctors
 in the Marshall Islands said before he left for the flight that he had 
been given the all clear to fly, although he was still having trouble 
walking, which was why he required a wheel chair to be taken to the 
aircraft at Majuro airport.

The fisherman washed ashore 
late last month in the Marshall Islands after spending more than a year 
drifting across the ocean living on what he could catch.

He
 reportedly asked the Mexican Deputy Head of Mission in Majuro, the 
Marshall Islands capital: 'What do I do when I get on the plane? What 
happens?'

He was told: 'You don't do anything but sit there and people come along and bring you food and drink.'

'That sounds good,' he said with a grin.

Mr Alvarenga's arrival time at Majuro's Amata Kabua International Airport had been kept secret.

At
 the last moment, however, the republic's President Christopher Loeak 
chose to give a brief photo opportunity in the airport's VIP lounge.

He said: 'Jose is welcome back here any time. We are very proud that we were able to help him."'

When asked if the he believes Jose's story, President Loeak said: 'I would like to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I have not seen him, but also I have no reason to doubt him.

'This is a mind-boggling story of surviving for 13 months.'

Initially Mr Alvarenga was to fly out on Friday, but eventually he left on Monday evening, headed for Honolulu.

His flights home will see him fly from Honolulu to either San Francisco or Los Angeles and from whichever one to San Salvador, capital of El Salvador.

New look: Looking clean shaven Alvarenga spoke briefly in a low voice at a press conference last week, thanking the government and his friends for their help

Boat: Willing Kajidrik also released a photo of police checking the 7-meter fishing boat of Jose Salvador Alvarenga after it was pulled onto the shore following his rescue, on Marshall Islands

Weak: Jose Salvador Alvarenga sits on a couch in Majuro in the Marshall Islands last Monday, after he was rescued from being washed ashore on the tiny atoll of Ebon in the Pacific Ocean

Having told doctors that he had kept 
himself alive as he drifted across the Pacific for 14 months by eating 
raw fish, the flesh of sea birds and turtles and drinking their blood 
and his own urine, there was concern about his kidneys and liver.

While
 he looked in remarkably good health and overall condition when seen on 
the atoll of Ebon after coming ashore for the first time since he had 
set out on an ill-fated fishing expedition, his health deteriorated when
 he was brought to Majuro.

Such
 was the concern of doctors that a day after he was released from 
hospital and taken to a lagoon-side hotel to relax he was returned to 
hospital and placed on a rehydration drip.

Then he was taken back to the hotel as arrangements were made to fly him home to his family for what will be a tearful reunion.

A
 police guard was placed outside his room to prevent journalists talking
 to him and every step was taken to ensure that details of his return 
journey did not leak out.

An
 El Salvadorian diplomat who flew from Japan brought with him a special 
passport-making kit, allowing him to prepare an emergency passport for 
Alvarenga so he could pass through US airports on the way home.

He also needed the document to enter his country of birth.
