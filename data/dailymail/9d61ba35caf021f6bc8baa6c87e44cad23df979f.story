A career criminal has been accused of shooting five people to death – including his mother and an aunt – in a Monday night rampage that terrorized a Texas town.

Charles Brownlow Jr., 36, was taken into custody early Tuesday morning by Terrell police after a high speed chase that followed him shooting five people and burning down the home he shared with his mother, according to reports.

The final person shot by Mr Brownlow, Luis Leal, 22, was recently engaged and had just become a father, Fox DFW reported.

Authorities first became aware of the shooting spree after discovering the body of a woman believed to be Mr Brownlow’s aunt just after 5pm Monday, according to the Dallas Morning News.

She was shot in the head, said officials.

This would be the first in a series of grisly discoveries.

‘We're all in a state of shock. You have a tendency to think, 'How can that happen here?' Terrell Police Chief Jody Lay said during a press briefing.

Shortly after that discovery, according to NBC DFW, police and firefighters responded to a nearby home on fire. The body of a woman believed to be Mr Brownlow’s mother was found inside.

Records show Mary Brownlow, 63, as living with Mr Brownlow at the Stallings Street address found on fire with a woman’s body inside.

The fire is ‘obviously arson,’ an official told NBC DFW.

‘This is a country community, a rural community, people are real close and this is going to have a really big impact on us,’ Chief Lay said during the briefing.

Mr Brownlow, who shared that home with his mother, stole her car and continued his violent bender, officials said.

‘This is a good community, and we don't know what happened and what triggered it all,’ neighbour Denise Fields told WFAA.

After firing shots at a home thought to be his girlfriend’s – no one was injured, Mr Brownlow is accused of killing two more people.

A man and a woman were discovered just before 10:30pm, WFAA reported. A three-year-old child found inside the house of horrors suffered no injuries, amazingly.

A cousin of at least one of the victims, Clarence Graham, couldn’t believe what had happened.‘I'm still in shock about it,’ he told WFAA. ‘I've got to let it soak in. I don't know. It's something that's hard to deal with.’

Only 10 minutes later, Mr Brownlow is said by officials to have shot dead Mr Leal during an attempted robbery at Ali’s Market, a convenience store where he worked, according to reports.

Andre Dye, a friend of Mr Brownlow’s, told local media that he doesn’t know what could have caused the shooting spree, that the accused killer is a good man.

Footage of the scene showed Mr Leal’s shocked relatives gathered in the parking lot of the usually busy minimart.

The violent thug was apprehended just before 1:30am Tuesday after a high speed chase that ended with him hiding in the woods and being found by a combination of a helicopter using a heat detecting camera and K-9 units.

Court records revealed Mr Brownlow has been convicted of a litany of criminal offenses dating back to the 1990s.

Starting with nine months probation for multiple theft charges in 1998, Mr Brownlow has been in and out of courtrooms most of his life.

He has also been convicted of multiple felony weapons and burglary charges, as well as domestic violence, drug possession and burglary of a vehicle.

The convicted felon’s most recent sting in prison was from 2008 until 2011, records show.

Mr Brownlow is currently in custody. Should he face capital murder charges, he would be eligible for the death penalty.
