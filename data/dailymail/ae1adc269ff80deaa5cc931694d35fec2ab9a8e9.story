With a happy grin on her face, Malone Farrow nestles into her husband - the man whom she credits for helping to put the troubling memories of her childhood behind her.

At the age of 28, the adopted daughter of Woody Allen and Mia Farrow has settled down and is a college graduate, writer and artist, married to an information-technology specialist.

Malone - who changed her name from Dylan - says he helped her recover from a childhood which she claims was marred when she was molested by award-winning director Allen when she was seven.

Breaking her silence last year, she told Maureen Orth in November's Vanity Fair: 'He’s the best thing that ever happened to me. I would not be functioning without him.'

It is this case that was brought back into the public eye yet again last night when Allen was honoured with the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Globes - much to the chagrin of his son Ronan Farrow and ex Mia Farrow, who were quick to react with disgust.

Lashing out: Ronan and Mia Farrow, pictured in May 2012, slammed Woody Allen on Twitter on Sunday

Ronan, 26, whom Mia recently revealed could in fact be the biological son of 
her first husband Frank Sinatra, lashed out on Twitter as Allen's long-time collorator and ex-girlfriend Diane Keaton made a lengthy and gushing tribute to the Blue Jasmine director.

‘Missed the Woody Allen tribute - did 
they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at 
age 7 before or after Annie Hall?’ he tweeted.

In August 1992, Malone told her mother that Allen had touched her inappropriately and kissed her all over in the attic at Mia's Connecticut country home. Allen, 78, has always denied the claims.

However, Malone stands by the allegations and told Orth she bitterly regrets not standing up herself in court, insisting: 'I have never been asked to testify. If I could talk to the seven-year-old Dylan, I would tell her to be brave, to testify.'

She claims that Allen told her it was their secret, but said it made her feel that she was a 'bad kid', stating she told her mother because she was 'cracking' and wanted the alleged abuse to stop.

Speaking to Vanity Fair, Malone recounted her childhood and revealed that even the sight of a fellow student at school wearing a Woody Allen T-shirt had once left her in a 'fit of vomiting'.

She told writer Orth that she will never utter her father's name, adding: 'There’s a lot I don’t remember, but what happened in the attic I remember. I remember what I was wearing and what I wasn’t wearing.' Orth added: 'I asked her if what she had said happened in the attic happened more than once', only for Malone to reply: 'That was isolated. The rest was just everyday weirdness -the weird routine I thought was normal.'

She called her fears of her father 'crippling' and said: 'I’m scared of him, his image. Nobody wants to think this legendary filmmaker is my worst nightmare. That’s what scares me, when I picture things chasing me or happening—I think it’s him after me. It’s hard to explain how terrifying that is.'

Justice Elliott Wilk dropped the 
case in 1993. He awarded custody of Malone - then Dylan - to Mia and 
denied Allen immediate visitation with her.

He allowed Mia's son Moses to decide for himself whether he wanted to 
see his adoptive father again, and he increased Ronan’s - then Satchel’s
 - visits to three a week, supervised.

The
 judge concluded that Allen demonstrated no parenting skills and was 
'self-absorbed, untrustworthy, and insensitive.' Allen appealed, but the
 opinion was upheld. And he lost his visits with Satchel in 1996 due to 
his son's 'phobic reaction' of him. The judge then ruled Dylan would 
never have to see him either and both brother and sister have since had no relationship with their father.

Malone married her husband in 2010 and it's obvious that Mia is hugely proud of her daughter, posting a touching picture Twitter in September 2012 with the note: 'My daughter Malone & her husband. Happiness. Love.'

Strong words: Woody's son and ex-girlfriend weren't happy about him receiving an honour at the Golden Globes

It is a far cry from Malone's childhood, in which she recounted struggling with depression and even making a suicide attempt.

Malone's claims were made in 1992 - a year after Mia and Allen separated when 
the actress discovered the director was having a sexual relationship 
with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi. The couple are now married and have two adopted daughters.

Following the molestation court case, Mia moved her children from New York to Connecticut.

But following the death of her adopted sister Tam at the age of 21 in 2000 from a heart condition, Malone told how she sank into a deep depression.

She started cutting herself and made a 'halfhearted' attempt at suicide, admitting: 'I’m not proud of it. It was very hard for me to cope. My mom was my rock, and Ronan was my best friend.'

Her depression was further exacerbated when she said that Allen succeeded in contacting her.

The first time was just before her 19th birthday in 2004, she said, when he sent her a letter saying that because she was 18 he wanted to have a conversation and 'set the record straight about what your mother has told you,' signing off 'Love, your father.'

Three years later, during her senior year of college, she said, he sent her a package of pictures of the pair together - and said that Soon-Yi missed her - adding that he wanted her to meet his new, adopted daughters, which stunned Malone.

Since meeting her husband, Malone is now writing and illustrating a book and made it clear he is her 'saviour'.

But that does not stop her mother and brother from furiously bringing the case back into the public eye.

Rosemary’s Baby star Mia had been 
live tweeting throughout the Golden Globes ceremony on Sunday, but made it clear that as soon as Woody’s 
tribute was about to begin, she was switching off.

‘Time to grab some icecream & switch over to #GIRLS,’ she wrote, followed by a simple: ‘Nite all.’ [sic]

She re-tweeted her son's message, but today hit back with anger, tweeting: 'A woman has publicly detailed Woody Allen's molestation of her at age 7. GoldenGlobe tribute showed contempt for her & all abuse survivors,'

The star then added: 'Is he a pedophile', before linking back to the Vanity Fair article.

Meanwhile, a family source today told MailOnline; 'Whever Ronan gets the chance to remind people he has no problem taking advantage of this opportunity.'

Anger: Mia Farrow's text on Monday

Reached this afternoon by MailOnline at her home in an exclusive 
private gated community in Florida, Malone Farrow had 
nothing to say about her adoptive father's Golden Globes honour.

'We 
are aware that her mother and brother have spoken out, but at this time 
she has no comment to make.' Malone's husband said.

'Everything Malone wanted to say was in the Vanity 
Fair article and if she chooses to say anything else in the future it 
will be at a time of her own choosing,'he added.
