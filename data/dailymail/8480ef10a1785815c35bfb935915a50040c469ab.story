Michael Kearns died after he was pinned down by bouncers outside Sailors nightclub in Newquay, Cornwall

A nightclub reveller died after four bouncers sat on him like a 'chair' for ten minutes until he stopped breathing, a court has heard.

Michael Kearns, 48, cried out for help and told the security staff he couldn't breathe as they held him face down on the pavement, prosecutors say.

But his pleas were allegedly ignored by doormen Lewis Bowns, 26, Richard Favetta, 30, Ian Harold, 45, and Graham Lutey, 34, who now stand accused of unlawfully killing Mr Kearns.

Truro Court Court heard the four men ejected Mr Kearns from Sailors nightclub in Newquay, Cornwall, on April 27 last year after he hit another man with stool.

Simon Laws, QC, prosecuting, told jurors: 'What he did was wrong and it was part of their job to deal with him.

'He struggled against them but it was a pretty one-sided contest. There were at times four of them against the one of him and at other times there were three of them against the one of him.'

Mr Laws said Mr Kearns was forced to the floor on his back then turned over so he was face down on the ground.

The jury, who saw CCTV footage of the incident, heard that Lutey, who was the senior doorman, was involved in restraining the lower part of Mr Kearns while Bowns dealt with his arms and head.

Favetta is alleged to have helped hold Mr Kearns down during the incident.

Mr Laws said Harold then 'took control of Mr Kearns's torso', kneeling on him and then sitting on him as a person would sit on a chair.

Mr Laws said: 'He was calling out that he could not breathe and saying that the doormen were choking him.

'They took no notice, they continued to use force on him without any regard to how he was faring. In truth, he was dying.' 

Mr Laws said this continued for approximately 10 minutes until a witness said Mr Kearns was not breathing and they got off him - but by then it was too late.

The four doormen later told police Mr Kearns was being aggressive and that officers had taken a long time to arrive.

Bowns, Favetta and Harold, all of Newquay, and Lutey, of Summercourt, Cornwall, all deny manslaughter. The trial continues.
