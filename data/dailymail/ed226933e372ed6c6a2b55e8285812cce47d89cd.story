She went through the trauma of nearly dying in child birth earlier this year but came through the
experience to welcome a healthy daughter into the world.

And now, Amanda Holden, who is also mother to six-year-old daughter Lexi 
with husband Chris Hughes, has been voted the celebrity mother they’d most like to turn to for baby related advice.

The Britain’s got Talent judge topped the poll of 400 women, winning over a third of the popular vote.

Holden, also famed for her roles in the TV series Cutting It and Wild at Heart, scored 36% of the vote, eleven points ahead of Holly Willoughby who came in second place.

Despite leading the brood of four children, picking up the bronze medal was Victoria Beckham, who only managed to achieve 15% of the public’s vote.

So great was Holden and Willoughby’s score that they left all opposition in their wake.

In fact the combined scores of the mothers outside the top three does not even come close to the score achieved by Holden.

Although going through a messy divorce with her husband Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, who hasn't let daughter Suri leave her side in recent months, took fourth place scoring seven per cent of the vote.

Just behind her was Myleene Klass with six per cent.

In joint sixth place with four per cent were Dannii Minogue and Angelina Jolie.

Behind them in joint seventh place were Beyoncé and Una Healy scoring three per cent.

In last place was the glamour model Katie Price who achieved only two per cent of the popular vote despite often being in the running for 'Mum of the year' awards.

A spokesperson for My1stYears.com, who carried out the survey, said: 'It is important to note that this poll is by no means a reflection on the celebs’ capability as mothers, it is merely a survey to see who mums would go to for advice.

'It is no real surprise that Amanda Holden topped the list as not only is she very popular at the moment, and her recent life experiences makes her very appealing to mothers.

'Likewise, Holly Willoughby comes across as very real and committed to the upbringing of her children as opposed to palming the responsibility off to a nanny.'

One mum who took part in the poll commented: 'I’ve got nothing against the other women on the list, but I voted for Holly Willoughby because she is someone who doesn’t parade her children round as fashion accessories. For her, family life is separate from her celebrity.'

Another participant said: 'I absolutely love Amanda Holden, you only have to listen to the support and advice she gives the contestants on Britain’s got Talent to know that she would give you excellent advice.'
