They are the latest craze to sweep the playground and the must-have accessory of the summer, despite the recent alerts over their potential dangers.

There's no denying that Britain has gone loom 
band crazy and ever since the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing 
one during the royal tour, sales have rocketed by more than 300 per cent.

And just to prove that hysteria a woman has jumped on the bandwagon by creating a dress made from 24,000 of the rubber pieces - and it's sparked a bidding war on eBay reaching a price of £154,000 in just three days.

Rubber goes couture: The craze for loom bands has spiralled even further, with a dress made from 24,000 of the wristbands up on eBay for £154,000. The dress, made by Kathryn Burnand, and modelled by her friend's daughter, received 126 bids in less than three days

Kathryn Burnand, 50, took three-and-a-half weeks painstakingly weaving the tiny bands together to make the size 4 outfit.

She spent £45 on 40 bags of 600 bands and expected to scrape a £50 profit from the venture.

Her best friend Helen Wright put the frock on eBay with a starting price of £50 and they were disappointed when it attracted little interest for the first two days.

But on Thursday, 126 bids came through in the space of four hours and the bidding stood at £153,921 at midday today with four days still remaining.

Intricate: She made the dress from 24,000 of the multicoloured bands, taking three-and-half-weeks to sew them together into a size 4 dress. Her best friend Helen Wright, also from Prestatyn, put the frock on eBay on Tuesday with a starting price of £50

The auction listing shows Helen's daughter, Sian, 12, modelling the multi-coloured outfit.

Mrs Burnand, who does not work as she suffers from Osteoarthritis said: 'I saw Sian was into these Loom Bands and thought I'd give a dress a go.

'It cost about £45 for the bands and I was working on the dress for 45 hours over three-and-a-half weeks.

'It's gone crazy. I phoned Helen at 2am [on Friday] and said "You've got to be joking". I would've been happy to make £50 profit, but this is ridiculous.'

Life changing: Kathryn Burnand said she's no eBay expert but if this is for real then it would be 'amazing' and she would buy a car and a holiday

Mrs Burnand, of Prestatyn, north Wales, has watched 29 bidders from across the world send the price shooting up.

'What a difference that money would make to me and Helen,' she said. 'I'd buy a car for my husband and go on a holiday.

'I've made things like this before for friends and for people's birthdays, and I've done dress-making in the past. I guess this is quite unique though.'

Ms Wright, 42, also of Prestatyn, said she had not told Sian about the bids yet, but said she would be 'the talk of school' once her friends found out.

Trendsetter: Kate waves and shows off her loom band given to her by well wishers during the Royal Tour of New Zealand in April

'It's not actually very nice to wear because it's very heavy,' she said. 'All the plastic bands make it quite uncomfortable to wear too.

'My daughter tried it on. She's found it quite a struggle to get on because it's a small dress.

'We're not a rich family. I'm not complaining with what I have at all, but this could be a great change in fortunes for us. These things never happen to people like us.

'I'm no eBay expert, I've only put on a few things here or there before, but if this is for real then it would be amazing.'

What a following: Even David Beckham (left) has been spotted wearing a loom band as has the Duchess of Cornwall (right)

Famous fans: The craze seems worldwide with American TV host

 and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder (right) gives the teen-craze bracelets the
 rock seal of approval

The simple, colourful, rubber bands, are 
weaved together to make friendship bracelets and have been seen on the 
arm of celebrities including presenter Fearne Cotton, David Beckham, One 
Direction’s Harry Styles and pop star Miley Cyrus.

However,
 the country’s largest craft retailer, Hobbycraft, has revealed that 
since Kate was seen wearing one during her tour of New Zealand and 
Australia, loom sales have gone through the roof.

So popular are loom bands, that they also occupy every top 20 spot on online retailer Amazon’s current bestselling toy chart.

And
 in terms of the best-selling toys of all time on Amazon, they come 
eighth place - after classics such as a Rubik’s Cube, Monopoly, Scrabble
 and Tommy Pop Up Pirate.

Child's play: Teens and younger children can get creative making the Loom bands which are the latest craze

The
 Duchess was given bracelets by two young girls during her trip in April
 and both she and husband Prince William wore them afterwards. Since 
then, Hobbycraft said sales have risen by 331 per cent. 

In addition to jewellery, loom bands can 
be used to create various accessories and toys, including key rings, 
phone cases and even shoes.

Anna Protherough, Senior Buyer for Kids at Hobbycraft said, ‘The loom bands are an absolute phenomenon.

‘We
began stocking the kits since they originally launched last year and 
since the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one, they have been 
flying off our shelves. The options for what you can create are endless 
and these kits really can keep children entertained for hours, perfect 
for the summer holidays.’

They were invented in the US last 
year by father-of-two Cheong Choon Ng. Since then, his company, Rainbow 
Looms, has sold more than four million kits - including a plastic loom, 
crochet hook and bands – worldwide.
