Rolls-Royce has defied the gloom to smash its sales record and boost the British economy.

The company, one of the UK’s most prestigious brands, sold 3,538 luxury cars in 2011 – the most in its 107-year history.

Bosses at the company said the outstanding performance was a ‘Great British success story’.

They said China was the largest market, overtaking the U.S.  for the first time since the launch of the £235,000 Phantom model in 2003.

Sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew 47 per cent in 2011 while business in Britain rose by 30 per cent.

Rolls-Royce’s announcement came as business leaders warned that the UK economy is at ‘a critical stage’ – but scolded doom-mongers predicting a double-dip recession.

‘A new recession is not a  foregone conclusion,’ insisted John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce.

Rolls-Royce, which is based in Goodwood, West Sussex, but owned by Germany’s BMW, said sales were driven by booming demand for the Phantom and the £165,000 Ghost.

Its sales were 31 per cent higher than in 2010 and eclipsed the previous record set in 1978 in the heyday of the Silver Shadow II.

‘We had an outstanding year in 2011 and we should take a moment to reflect on this Great British success story,’ said Torsten Müller-Ötvös, chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.

‘Our business is in excellent shape. We are developing our dealer network, moving into new markets like South America, expanding our manufacturing operation in West Sussex to meet global demand and plan to develop our product range.’

After China and the U.S., Britain is the third biggest market for Rolls-Royce, followed by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

Rival ultra-luxury car company Bentley, which is owned by Volkswagen and based in Crewe, last week reported a 37 per cent jump in sales to just over 7,000.

The surge in exports will be welcomed by ministers, who are relying on demand from overseas to drive economic recovery.

A report by the BCC today warns that the economy will stagnate early this year.

Mr Longworth said: ‘Action is urgently needed to tackle short-term stagnation and a lack of business confidence, damaged by the ongoing eurozone crisis.’

In its Quarterly Economic Survey, the BCC urges ministers to press ahead with plans to slash red tape, reform the planning system, invest in infrastructure and help firms access vital funds as bank lending slumps.

‘A slowdown across the eurozone is inevitable, but Britain need not suffer a similar fate,’ said Mr Longworth.

nLingerie chain La Senza went into administration yesterday, leading to the closure of more than 100 outlets and the loss of 1,300 jobs.

And in a further blow, bankrupt cross-Channel ferry operator SeaFrance was ordered to close by a French court, resulting in the loss of 127 jobs in Britain.
