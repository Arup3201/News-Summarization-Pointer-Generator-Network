AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani has confirmed he is in talks with Chelsea for Fernando Torres and Marco van Ginkel.

The Italian club are willing to pay Chelsea's asking price for Torres but have no agreement with the player who is on £150,000 a week at Stamford Bridge and would expect a pay-off to leave.

Chelsea are receptive to allowing Dutch midfielder Van Ginkel out on loan as he needs games following his cruciate ligament injury last year.

Put him out of his misery: AC Milan are interested in bringing Fernando Torres to the club

Loan deal: Marco van Ginkel has only played four times for Chelsea, who would be happy to loan him out

Milan want a striker to replace Mario Balotelli but  should Torres refuse to join, they have sounded out Liverpool striker Fabio Borini for a potential loan as well as Roberto Soldado of Tottenham and Konstantinos Mitroglou of Fulham.

Galliani told Milan Channel: 'Our goal is to take a great striker. Fernando Torres? He is a great striker. Let’s see if he comes or someone else. We are actively working.

'Van Ginkel? We are confident. We have made our proposal to Chelsea and are now waiting on an answer. We hope we can get him.'

Target: Liverpool's Fabio Borini has also attracted the interest of AC Milan and would be cheaper than Torres

Meanwhile, Chelsea midfielder George Saville has joined Wolves in a £1million deal. Saville, 21, has signed a three-year contract.

Saville will be followed out of Chelsea by Patrick Bamford, 20, who is joining Middlesbrough on loan for the season and he is expected to be joined later in the week by Chelsea Under 21 captain Lewis Baker.

Middlesbrough are also working to sign winger Yanic Wildschut, 22, from Heerenveen. However, Heerenveen's technical manager Hans Vonk is reluctant to let Wildschut leave.

Struggling: Roberto Soldado has been a disappointment at Tottenham, and Milan may make a move for him
