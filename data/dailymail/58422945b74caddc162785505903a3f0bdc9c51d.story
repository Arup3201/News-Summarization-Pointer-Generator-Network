They have some of the most provocative names around and, at first glance, may seem less than appetising when reaching for a snack or drink.

But what seems like terrible brands to us could just actually be the true meanings of words getting lost in translation.

From Japan's Cream Collon biscuit rolls to Finland's Megapussi crips, FEMAIL reveals some of the most unfortunately named foods in the world. 

Japan's Cream Collon is a biscuit snack shaped like small tubes and filled with cream

Cream Collon Biscuit Roll

Biscuit snacks shaped like small tubes and filled with cream should not be labelled with such a laughable name. The Japanese product, which is manufactured by the country's biggest confectionery company Glico, is a favourite with students and children. 

Collon, which of course is sounds and looks like the name for the large intestine, was a deliberate choice of moniker for this particularly product. One can't help but wonder what the manufacturers were thinking when they came up with this gem.

Breast Munchies are made from 100% chicken breast nuggets and are enjoyed by Australians 

Breast Munchies 

Produced by Australian brand Inghams, the chicken nuggets, or breast munchies to give them their rightful name, are a popular oven-cooked meal in Down Under. 

Made from 100 per cent chicken breast, the munchies are a good example of the Aussie sense of humour, which doesn't take anything too seriously. And we have to applaud them for that.  

Finland's Megapussi Juusto Snacks are similar in smell and taste to Wotsits 

Megapussi Juusto Snacks 

They look like Wotsits, they may smell like Wotsits and according to their fans, they even taste like Wotsits but they're definitely not known as Wotsits. 

Instead, this cheesy snack from Finland has been given a rather rude name, which will no doubt bring tears of laughter to all corn-based snack connoisseurs . 

Batmilk yogurt is a product of Brazilian company Batavo and is made from cow's milk 

Batmilk yogurt 

Brazilian dairy company Batavo's yogurt has one of the most unlikely names for a product of its nature. But rest assured that this treat is definitely not made from the milk of bats but instead comes from normal cows' milk. 

The company received such bad press after launching the product that they decided to change the name to something less offensive. 

Romanian hot drink Urinal is made with cranberries and is said to offer 'natural protection'

Urinal hot drink  

While in some places this is commonly used as a receptacle in male restrooms, for some people urinal is a hot drink.  

Romania's hot cranberry cordial drink is said to offer natural protection (due to natural antioxidants in cranberries) and 'contribute to fluid in the body. 

We cannot however confirm if it is a diuretic.  

China's Only Puke crackers are actually known as Only Pukeet

Only Puke crackers

With a name that makes you think of vomiting, this snack is not going to be the first choice for those looking for a savoury treat.

The honey bean crackers are a product of China and are actually known as Only Pukeet.

Unfortunately due to bad product design, the last two letters in the word are invisible, saddling this treat with a name that could make you lose your appetite.

Japan's Crunky Ball Nude or Crunky Nude Ballis made with hazelnut paste and malt and covered in chocolate

Crunky Ball Nude

The second Japanese product appearance in the list, the provocative Crunky Ball Nude or Crunky Nude Ball is a confection made with hazelnut paste and malt, covered in crisped rice and chocolate.

And while it may look like a downmarket version of a Ferrero Rocher, online reviews say that these nude balls are less tasty than the product that could have inspired from.

At a Turkish party? Dip your crudites in tzatziki, muhammara or cemen 

Fresh Cemen Dip 

Surely no party is complete without some cemen dip? The spicy garlic spread is found on chiller cabinets in Turkish supermarkets and is a case of the true meaning of a word getting lost in translation.

In Turkish cemen is actually the word for a dip made from tomato paste. 

Unfortunately it translates as something else in English. 

Slake your thirst with a Greek Vergina beer  

Vergina beer

A pale lager produced in Macedonian Thrace Brewery in Komotini, Greece, Vergina Beer is said to have a light hoppy flavour with hints of malt. 

According to beer reviewer Michael Fajardo, the  only negative about this beer is that it also has a mild metallic flavour.
