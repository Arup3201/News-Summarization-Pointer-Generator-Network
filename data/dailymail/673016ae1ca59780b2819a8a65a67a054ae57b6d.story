An unfortunate otter is making a speedy recovery after being hit in the head and body by a shotgun.

The otter, nicknamed Wally, was brought into Vancouver Aquarium Marine Animal Rescue Centre two months ago with serious injuries to his flippers and face.

He had been found distressed and in pain on the shoreline of Tofino, in British Columbia, bleeding from his wounds.

When X-rayed, vets found traces of shotgun pellets in Wally's face and body.

The
 centre's veterinary team, headed by Dr. Martin Haulena, performed 
multiple surgeries on the shattered bones in one of the otter's 
flippers, as well as oral work due to the three broken teeth Wally 
suffered from the blast.

To 
show how much better the otter is now feeling, the aquarium recently 
released pictures of Wally chomping on clams, which they say show that 
he is a great sign that he is recovering from his oral injuries.

Dr. Haulena, of Vancouver Aquarium Marine Mammal Rescue Centre, said: ‘Walter still has a long way to go, but he has made significant progress.

‘His flexibility has improved, which means he can now groom himself much better. Having removed his broken teeth and treated his oral infection, he should feel much more comfortable.

‘We will go through the process now of trying to heal him up as best we can.’
