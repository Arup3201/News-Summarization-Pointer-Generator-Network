Camp Bastion, the once sprawling British base in Afghanistan where the war against the Taliban was waged, is due to close today – eight years after the first UK troops pitched their tents in the Helmand desert.

Following the deaths of 453 British personnel and an outlay of well-over £20 billion, Britain's largest operational base built anywhere since the Second World War will be handed over to Afghan troops.

It comes as Britain prepares to withdraw entirely from the country by the end of this year. By next month more British troops will be deployed against the Ebola virus than in Afghanistan.

Bastion has been the centre of British operations in the country since UK troops were sent to Helmand in 2006. The vast majority of the tens of thousands of British fighters who served in 'Task Force Helmand' since then, have passed through the camp.

The base was initially constructed as an airfield, but grew to the size of Reading. At its peak, it had a temporary Pizza Hut, a well-equipped gym and a bar called Heroes, which only served alcohol-free beer.

The base's runway, at one point the fifth busiest UK-operated airstrip, is expected to handle commercial flights. 

In 2006, the Government said UK forces would be there only to protect reconstruction, but they quickly got caught up in the struggle against the Taliban insurgency.  

A ceremony marking the departure of the last 1,500 UK troops from Camp Bastion is due to take place this morning. Subject to security arrangements, these soldiers will then be driven to a U.S. airbase over the next couple of days.

The ceremony, which will include the lowering of the Union Jack, will be attended by the senior British officer in southern Afghanistan, Brigadier Robert Thomson, the second in command of the U.S-led Regional Command (South West).

Over the last year, 3,400 pieces of military hardware have been shipped or flown back to the UK.

Anything not coming back has been destroyed so it cannot be used by the Taliban who are still believed to control huge swathes of Helmand.

It is expected that all British combat troops will fly home from southern Afghanistan before Christmas. Following the end of the combat mission in December, around 400 British servicemen and women will stay on in non-combat roles, assisting with training programmes.

A memorial wall at the camp bearing the name of every Briton who fell in Afghanistan has been dismantled and is to be displayed at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.

The camps location has meant that it was largely protected from Taliban attacks, but in September 2012, 15 insurgents disguised in U.S. uniforms opened fire at the camp. The attack, which took place while Prince Harry was stationed there, left two U.S. marines dead and a dozen injured.  

Mohammad Naeem, the governor of Helmand, has reportedly said that the takeover of the base by his forces can go ahead because they are now able to control the province without foreign help.

The camp was attacked by Taliban fighters in 2012, while Prince Harry was stationed there, and resulted in the deaths of two U.S. marines; a dozen other personnel were also injured

One battalion of troops, believed to be Americans, are expected to be the only foreign forces to remain.Taliban operations to reclaim towns such as Sangin and Nowzad, once held by British forces, have inflicted heavy casualties on Afghan forces this year.

Chief of the General Staff General Sir Nick Carter has said that security there remains 'difficult'.

He has reportedly said that the handover of Camp Bastion would be significant 'not least because of the sacrifice that so many people have made in Helmand'.

Mr Carter said he expected 'challenges' but was confident that the majority of the population in central Helmand will be secured by Afghan forces. 

At the peak of the Afghan conflict there were 10,000 British personnel in Helmand together with 20,000 US Marines, Danes, Estonians and other nationalities at 180 bases and checkpoints. 

The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on when Camp Bastion would be handed over.
