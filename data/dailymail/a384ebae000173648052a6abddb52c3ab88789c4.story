An  Indian grandfather has been left paralyzed after a police officer violently frisked him and pulled him to the ground - even though he wasn't committing a crime.

Sureshbhai Patel was walking along a sidewalk in Madison, Alabama, last week when he was roughed up by the cop and pushed to floor - injuring his spine.

The 57-year-old, who doesn't speak English, had only been in the country for two weeks, arriving so he could help take care of his 17-month-old grandson.

He is being treated in Huntsville Hospital and has limited movement in his right leg but his family fear he may never leave.

Madison Police have wished Mr Patel a speedy recovery and have suspended one of the officers involved while they investigate what happened.

Horrifying: Sureshbhai Patel has been left temporarily paralyzed after he was frisked and pulled to the ground by a police officer in Madison, Alabama. The cop in question, who has not been named, has been suspended 

The 57-year-old, who had only been in the United States for two weeks, has limited movement in his right leg but his family fears he may never be able to leave the hospital 

Two officers initially responded to a complaint a 'suspicious person' was looking in garages around the neighborhood which residents say is usually quiet. 

The caller said they did not recognize Mr Patel and claimed he was walking on other people's property.  

When they arrived on the scene he said 'no English', and repeated his son's house number  in a bid to inform them he was in fact a resident.

He stepped away when officers tried to search him, prompting one of them to bring him to the ground. 

They claim a 'communication barrier' is partially to blame for what happened and have wished Mr Patel a speedy recovery. 

Quiet suburb: Officers initially responded to a complaint a 'suspicious person' was looking in garages around the neighborhood. His attorney has claimed there was nothing suspicious 'other than he has brown skin'

Anger: His son Chirag, who paid for him to fly over from the small Indian village of Pij, said bringing his father over to the United States was a dream. He was surprised at the attack as he believes its a good neighborhood 

His son Chirag, who paid for him to fly over from the small Indian village of Pij, told AL.com: 'This is a good neighborhood. I didn't expect anything to happen.

'He was just walking on the sidewalk as he does all the time. They put him to the ground.' 

'It is a dream for me because I came from a very poor family and I worked so hard here.' 

Hank Sherrod, an attorney for the family, told the site: 'This is broad daylight, walking down the street. There is nothing suspicious about Mr. Patel other than he has brown skin. 

'This is just one of those things that doesn't need to happen.'

The police statement read: 'The subject began putting his hands in his pockets. Officers attempted to pat the subject down and he attempted to pull away. The subject was forced to the ground, which resulted in injury. 

Madison Police have refused to reveal the identity of the officer involved and have not released video or audio evidence of the stop. 

A GoFundMe account has been set up to help pay for Mr Patel's medical bills. The goal is to reach more than $25,000. 

Untouched: The clothes his father had laid out on his bed in preparation for his stay are left folded up
