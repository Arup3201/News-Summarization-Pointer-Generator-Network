Aaron Collins' dying wish was that his family leave underpaid waitstaff a $500 tip on pizza orders around America.

Now his loyal brother, who is carrying out his dream, has revealed what inspired Collins' generous wish.

'Aaron's at Buffalo Wild Wings and gets a waitress who it's her first night on the job, guys are drinking and yelling, and she's getting orders all wrong,' Seth Collins, from Kentucky, said. 'She did everything wrong and told Aaron she was gonna quit.'

'When Aaron got the bill - and remember, he didn't make a lot of money - he left her a $50 tip, and wrote on the check, 'Don't give up'.

'Immediately, you could see, her attitude changed and Aaron thought, 'Imagine what a $500 tip could do.'

Seth Collins told Fox News that act of kindness was typical of his younger brother.

'That was Aaron - 'Be good to your friends,' he'd say. If you're good to other people, they'll be good to you,' Seth Collins said.

Aaron
 Collins, a computer technician, passed away last year aged just 30, but in his will told 
his family: 'Leave an awesome tip (and I don't mean 25%, I mean $500 on an f*****g pizza) for a waiter or waitress.'

His older brother, Seth Collins, created a website and
 started raising money to carry out the kind act.

Instead of $500, Seth 
raised over $60,000 from generous donors, and is now on the final leg of an 18-month U.S. road 
trip. He has so far left 88 tips totaling $44,000.

Tragic: Aaron Collins died in July 2012, aged just 30

Speaking for the first time, Seth Collins said he has been overwhelmed by the generosity of donors 'from every continent except Antarctica'.

He said every recipient of 'The Tip' has been deeply moved by the sweet gesture, which hasn't depended on the quality of the service.

'Everyone has a bad moment, a bad day. I'm sure that person who's waiting on you didn't go to work intending to give you bad service,' he said.

'And waiters, waitresses have told me, when they get The Tip, it changes them - it lets them know someone appreciates how hard they work and how little they make.'

The family say enough money has been raised through the website and donation page for Seth to hand out a $500 surprise weekly for the next two years.Â

In Chicago, Vanessa Goldschmidt from Pequod's Pizza in Chicago, was taken aback when Seth Collins tipped her in July. This was the 56th donation.

'I'm
 like shaking right now. Are you kidding? Oh, my gosh. I'm shaking right
 now. That's amazing,' the waitress said before grabbing Seth in a hug.

'It was just like another Thursday night, coming into work, hoping for the best. It's a slow night,' Goldschmidt told the Chicago Tribune. 'I'm just taken aback. It's such an amazing gesture.'

Seth Collins is taping each heartfelt reaction to his generosity.

He believes he will visit up to 100 restaurants in all 50 states, he told the New York Daily News.

The
 time-consuming but rewarding experience was most moving, he said, when 
he visited Pies & Pints Pizzeria in Charleston, West Virginia.

Seth Collins month: Lexington Mayor Jim Gray gave Seth Collins the key to the city for his generosity of spirit

The server who happened to be assigned to his table had just lost his mother two weeks before and Seth Collins was pleased he could, in some small way, make him happy.

'The passing of my brother gave him something special and made him happy so soon after the loss of his mother,' Collins told the Daily News.

Seth Collins, who has two younger sisters, said Aaron has been on his mind each and every time, and his dying wish had taught him an important lesson he is hoping will rub off.

'It's definitely reminded me of how important it is to be generous,' he said.

While Seth Collins doesn't know what his next step will be when the money runs out, he says the experience has been rewarding.

'But I have to get on with my life, you know?' he said.

'What's most important is that long after the money is gone, they'll take that moment and pay it forward -- to be good and generous to other people. Aaron would have loved that.'
