She might be one of the world's longest serving heads of state but it seems that not even the Queen is exempt from getting stuck in a traffic jam.

The 88-year-old monarch was en route to a reception at Canada House in London, when her official Bentley got stuck in the notoriously heavy traffic in Trafalgar Square.

Luckily for the Queen, who was travelling with the Duke of Edinburgh, her driver managed to extricate the car and get her to the event on schedule.

One is not amused: The Queen looks less than impressed after battling traffic en route to the event

Made it! The Queen steps out of her official car after arriving at Canada House in London

Stuck: A few moments earlier, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh had been stuck in heavy traffic

Her Majesty was visiting Canada House, the  home of the Canadian High Commission, to reopen it following extensive renovations.

Resplendent in a turquoise tweed coat and a matching dress and hat, the Queen appeared none the worse for her lengthy journey and beamed broadly as she spied a pair of Mounties [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] waiting for her outside.

Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, Her Majesty was then ushered indoors, where she was presented with a ceremonial set of keys.

Made from gold, silver and nickel, they are an updated version of the set presented to King George V, who opened the building shortly after it was completed in 1925.

Afterwards, the Queen and Prince Philip were given a tour of the newly refurbished building and were introduced to High Commission staff.

The Queen was also presented with a pair of posies by eight-year-old Alexandra Yepez and her sister Natalia, five, the daughters of Canadian Consul-General, Lisa Almond.

Not impressed: Sitting in the front seat of the car, the Queen's protection officer looked glum

Big arrival: After the car was extricated from the jam, it eventually pulled up outside Canada House

None the worse: When the royal couple emerged, they looked none the worse for the experience

Of particular interest to Her Majesty was the atrium, which has been renamed in her honour and features Canadian hemlock cladding and a swathe of red oak flooring.

The atrium, although the newest addition to the list, is by no means the only place named after the monarch.

In Canada alone, no fewer than 62 schools, roads, hospitals and parks are named after Her Majesty, among them an observatory, an island chain and two different mountain ranges.

Elsewhere, the list of places named after the Queen includes a city in South Australia, British and Australian Antarctica and Queen Elizabeth National Park, which is famous for its beauty and tree-climbing lions, in Uganda.

All smiles: The Queen looked cheerful and wore a pretty turquoise tweed coat and a matching hat

Friendly chat: The Queen chats to artist Charles Pachter from Pachter Hall and Moose Factory in Toronto

While the new atrium isn't on quite the same scale, the Queen certainly appeared to enjoy the visit and looked animated as she spoke to the construction team behind it.

Before she and the Duke of Edinburgh braved the traffic for a second time on their way home, Her Majesty found time to unveil a plaque and add her name to the visitors book.

'We are honoured that Her Majesty and His Royal Highness were able to join us to celebrate the opening of a high commission that is very dear to Canadians and that reflects the depth of our friendship with the United Kingdom,' said High Commissioner Campbell afterwards.

'It is our pleasure to name such a distinctly Canadian feature of this building in Her Majesty’s honour. 

Nice view! The Queen inspects the view from one of the windows at the newly refurbished Canada House

Is that for me? The Queen accepts posies from eight-year-old Alexandra Yepez and her sister Natalia, five

Nicely done! The two little girls then showed Her Majesty their very best curtsies, much to her delight

Big day: The two little girls completed their task with aplomb, watched by their mother Lisa Almond

Lovely: The Queen prepares to return to her car, clutching the two very pretty posies

'Canada House serves as our country’s front door to the United Kingdom. This revitalisation project offered us an ideal opportunity to bring the best of Canada straight to the heart of one of the world’s great cities.' 

Today's visit comes towards the end of a busy week for the Queen, who has spent much of it conducting official business at Buckingham Palace.

Much has focused on her diplomatic work, with the Queen receiving new ambassadors from Egypt, Kazakhstan and Eritrea, as well as entertaining Maltese president, Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, who is making an official visit to the UK.

She also attended a reception held to mark the 80th birthday of Diabetes UK at St James's Palace on Tuesday evening. 

Royal salute: The Mounties gave Her Majesty a sharp salute as she made her way out

Job done: During the visit, the Queen saw the new Queen Elizabeth II Atrium and unveiled a plaque
