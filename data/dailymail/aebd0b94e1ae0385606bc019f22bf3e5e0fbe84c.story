A jealous boyfriend who stabbed his partner 83 times with four different knives after wrongly accusing her of having an affair has been jailed for life.

Cornelius Brown, 23, tortured and killed 30-year-old Jade Riley-Ward in the kitchen of her house in Somercotes, Derbyshire, in September last year.

Brown then called his mother and asked her to come to the house where, still covered in his girlfriend's blood, he begged her to kill him because he 'wasn't man enough to do it.'

Nottingham Crown Court heard that Jade and Brown had known each other since childhood, as Jade had been his babysitter, and they started a relationship in January 2012.

But Brown's 'jealous streak' soon became apparent and nine days before her death, Jade sent Brown a text message saying she 'wanted space'.

In a jealous rage, Brown became convinced that Jade was having an affair behind his back.

On September 22 last year Brown visited Jade's house with mutual friend Wayne Roberts who left before Brown began his attack.

Sentencing Brown to life with 20 years before being considered for parole, Judge Jonathan Teare said: 'Your attack on Jade Riley-Ward was deliberate, vicious and prolonged.

'It would not be wrong to describe it as torture. You used up to four knives to inflict 52 individual cuts on her head, face, torso and back.

'She tried to defend herself to the point that there were another 31 defence wounds to her hands and arms. She tried to stop you and not one of those knife wounds killed her outright. She essentially bled to death at your hands.'

Prosecutor Richard Thatcher explained that after the killing Brown had walked around the house, leaving bloody footprints on the carpet while smoking three cigarettes.

He added: 'At 3.39pm the defendant made a call to his mother. The defendant had spent a little time walking around the property.

'The defendant's mother arrived at the house by taxi and emerged from it a short time later screaming. It was a tragic 30 minutes that ended with the horrific death of Miss Riley-Ward.'

Brown was sentenced to life in jail after pleading guilty to the 'vicious and prolonged' attack

The court heard that during the attack a neighbour had heard a cutlery drawer rattling and the sound of Jade screaming, while a 16-year-old boy walking past had heard Brown shout 'don't make me do it'.

Jade also tried to call Mr Roberts but he said the line was cut off and when he phoned her back, four calls went to voicemail.

In Brown's defence, Patrick Thompson said: 'Nothing I can say can minimise the suffering and impact on Jade Riley-Ward's family and friends, who have lost a much-loved woman.

'The real mitigation is his guilty plea. He has never denied responsibility for the killing.

'This was an act carried out in the heat of the moment, there is no evidence it was pre-meditated and clearly he was emotionally immature.

'He lost his temper and committed the most dreadful, dreadful act. He bitterly regrets what took place, he did not try to cover his tracks and blame someone else.'

Speaking outside court, Jade's mother, Maria, paid tribute to her daughter as a lively, vibrant and life-loving woman with many friends.

She added: 'Since her death my life has been full of dark days that only the mother who has lost her only child can have.

'Nothing can bring my daughter back. Her life ended at the hands of someone who is evil and barbaric.
