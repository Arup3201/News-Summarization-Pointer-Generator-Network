He may have spent the last three years in retirement, but that hasn't diminished the appeal of Robert Pires for an army of Indian fans.

The former Arsenal man arrived in India to sign for FC Goa, and was greeted by a swarm of supporters.  

Pires stopped to pose for photos and sign autographs. He then tweeted: 'Didn't know I had so many fans in India!'

The 40-year-old has come out of retirement to play for FC Goa, one of eight teams in the newly created league, and will be joined in the competition by a host of other ageing stars.

Former Gunners team-mate Freddie Ljungberg will play for Mumbai City while Alessandro Del Piero, David Trezeguet, Elano, Mikael Silvestre and David James will also feature in the league. 

Pires retired in 2011 when his Aston Villa contract expired. He was brought to the club by compatriot Gerard Houllier but only featured nine times for the Midlands club. 

Meanwhile, former Inter Milan defender Marco Materazzi has joined Chennaiyin FC. Although he might play for the club, the World Cup winner revealed he will primarily act as their manager. 

'I am first a manager,' Materazzi told The Hindu. 'Our main players will be Elano, (Mikael) Silvestre and other Indian players. We can only play five or six foreigners.

'So maybe I will be on the bench. And, we can’t play without Indian players. We are here for them.'
