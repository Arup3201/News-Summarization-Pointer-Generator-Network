Eighteen-year-old Karl Pierson, who opened fire on his high school in Colorado earlier this month, entered through a door that should have been locked, authorities have revealed.

The gunman, who fatally shot a female student in the head and eventually took his own life, was clearly carrying firearms and ammunition when he walked through an outside door that had been left ajar at Arapahoe High School in Centennial on December 13.

Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson revealed new details in the tragic shooting at a news conference on Monday morning.

Terror: Karl Pierson, 18, opened fire on Arapahoe High School on December 13 after entering the school through a door that should have been locked, but rarely was. He fatally injured Claire Davis before killing himself

He also revealed that Pierson, who is believed to have targeted a teacher at the school after being dropped from the debating team, had spent the morning of the shooting bowling alone.

In an eerie parallel, it was initially reported in 1999 that the two Columbine High School shooters also went bowling before opening fire, killing 13 and then themselves. This has since been disputed.

When Pierson entered the school through the door - which was rarely locked - he was armed with a shotgun, a machete, 125-rounds of shotgun ammunition and three homemade explosive devices.

'[He] made no effort to conceal the fact that he was armed,' Robinson said, the Denver Post reported.

He fired three rounds into the hallway and then two near the library before throwing an explosive at a bookshelf. He then used a sixth shot to kill himself.

In the hallway, his second round was fired directly at 17-year-old Claire Davis, who was struck in the head. She died from her injuries on December 21.

The school janitor was the first to sound the warning and a prompt lockdown followed due to the efforts of school resource officer James Englert and security guard Rod Mauler, Robinson said.

'James Englert is a hero,' Robinson said, adding that he will be a pall bearer at Davis' memorial service on Saturday.

The whole ordeal lasted one minute and 17 seconds.

Authorities are still investigating reports that Pierson was targeting his debate coach and the librarian Tracy Murphy after the student was dropped from the debate team.

The new information comes little over a week since the death of Claire Davis, eight days after she was shot at blank point range and put on life support.

 in peace: Claire Davis, 17, was pronounced dead eight days after 
being shot in the head by the gunman

Loss: Students payed their respects to Claire at the fence outside Arapahoe High School hours after she died

Pierson's parents, Barbara and Mark, 
issued a short statement via email after their son's victim's death in 
which they said that their prayers were with Claire’s family.

‘We are heartbroken to hear of 
Claire's passing. Our hearts ache for her family as they deal with 
unimaginable grief. Our prayers are with Claire's family & the 
entire Arapahoe community,’ read the statement.

Davis,
 who spent just over a week in a coma, was surrounded by her family at 
the time of her passing, according to a message posted on the hospital's Facebook page.

At the request of her family and friends, The Denver Foundation announced it had created a fund in Claire's name on Dec. 16.

The
 foundation said the Arapahoe High School Community Fund honoring Claire
 Davis will support mental health care, anti-bullying programs and other
 community needs chosen by her parents, the fund's advisers.

‘Last
 week was truly a paradox in that we lost our daughter, yet we witnessed
 the wonderful love that exists in the world through the tremendous 
outpouring of support we received,’ the Davis family said in a statement.

'Although we have lost our precious daughter, we will always be 
grateful for the indelible journey she took us on over the last 17 
years - we were truly blessed to be Claire’s parents.

'The grace, laughter …and light she brought to this world will not be 
extinguished by her death; to the contrary, it will only get stronger.'

There was no indication that the gunmen knew her or was acquainted with her.

Sheriff Robinson said that Claire wouldn't have had any time to run from the shooter, 
correcting earlier reports that she may have been trying to stop him.

Hundreds of Arapahoe High School students gathered for a candlelight vigil on Saturday December 14, the day after the shooting which left Claire Davis in a coma for eight days

A 
friend who was with Claire at the time dragged her to safety in a nearby
 yoga class, according to the Denver Post.

Sheriff Robinson said that Pierson had legally purchased the shotgun on December 6, a full week before the incident.

'His evil intent was to harm multiple individuals,' Sheriff Robinson said.

Arapahoe
 High School is 16 miles from the Aurora movie theater where a 
shooting occurred in June 2012 and only eight miles from Columbine High 
School, the scene of a mass school shooting in April 1999.

Around 2,230 students attend Arapahoe
 High School, which is a part of Littleton Public Schools.
