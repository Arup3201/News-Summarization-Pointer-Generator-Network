Imprisoned killer Joran Van der Sloot is now a father after his wife of three months gave birth to a baby girl.

The child was born on Sunday in Lima, Peru - far from the remote prison where van der Sloot is serving a 28-year sentence for killing a Peruvian business student in 2010, his attorney Maximo Altez said. The child was named Dushy after Van der Sloot's grandmother.

Van der Sloot also remains the chief suspect in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba.

Killer Joran Van der Sloot is a father after his wife gave birth to a baby girl on Sunday. In 2010, he confessed to killing Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old business student. The murderer was the last person seen with U.S. student Natalee Holloway, who vanished while on a  trip to Aruba. No charges were filed against Van der Sloot and the case remains unsolved

Van der Sloot married 24-year-old Leidy Figueroa (pictured last week) in July. She gave birth to his daughter on Sunday, whom she named Dushy after Van der Sloot's grandmother

Van der Sloot married 25-year-old Peruvian trainee accountant Leidy Figueroa in July. 

A month later, authorities sent him to a prison high in the Andes, saying he had threatened to kill the warden of the lockup near Lima.

Van der Sloot  was transferred to the feared Challapalca prison just over a month ago.

In interviews exclusively with MailOnline last week, Figueroa spoke for the first time to insist that Van der Sloot is 'gentle, sensitive, kind' and 'no monster', despite being a convicted murderer and the main suspect in the disappearance of American student Miss Holloway in 2005.

Ms Figueroa insisted her husband has changed since they started an unlikely prison romance four years ago.

She declared: 'My Joran is no monster'.

 She said the 6ft 5in killer is a 'different man' after finding God and says he 'seeks forgiveness' for the evil he has committed.

And in a series of astonishing prison love letters seen by MailOnline, Van der Sloot's passionate feelings for his 5ft 3in wife were laid bare.

Ms Figueroa also said that her husband is close to breaking point after becoming deeply depressed by his new living conditions which he describes as 'worse than Guantanamo Bay'. 

The prison's conditions are in stark contrast to those under which Van der Sloot fell in love with Leidy in an unlikely prison romance four years ago. 

The couple were even allowed to marry behind bars earlier this summer.

Lax prison rules also meant he was able to play online poker, use a cellphone, take drugs and have other women come and go as he pleased. 

And he enjoyed teaching English to other inmates and doing arts and crafts, making ceramic sculptures for his wife. 

Van der Sloot was transferred to Challapalca after he threatened to kill the warden of the Piedras Gordas penitentiary in Lima.

He was found with an illegal cellphone which was confiscated, officials of the Inpe prisons administration said. 

Van der Sloot even recorded a video in which he showed the conditions in his cell, later saying that it was warden Sergio Haro who provided him with the cellphone.

'The warden himself gave it to me. I don't know why, but I suspect that it was to set a trap for me,' said Van der Sloot in a portion of the video.

According to Leidy, Warden Haro was furious and told her husband he had never liked him. Van der Sloot was immediately thrown in the 'Hole' – solitary confinement – for six days.

Leidy said: 'When he came out of the Hole the warden told Joran that he won't see his baby daughter when she's born. Joran didn't believe him but the warden is true to his word.'  

However she is confident that one day she and Van der Sloot will be together properly. 'Somehow one day he’s going to leave prison and we can be a family,' she said.  

Van der Sloot is expected to remain in prison until 2038 and then be extradited to the United States to face charges of extortion and fraud for allegedly falsely promising to lead Natalee Holloway's mother to the girl's body in exchange for $25,000 payment.

The murderer was the last person seen with Holloway, who vanished while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba.

No charges were filed against Van der Sloot and the case remains unsolved.

In 2010, he confessed to killing Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old business student, five years to the day after Holloway's disappearance.
