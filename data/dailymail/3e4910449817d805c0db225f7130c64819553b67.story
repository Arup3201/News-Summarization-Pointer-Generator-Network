A football fan who was shocked into slimming after being involved in a road accident has won a national award for losing more than 22st.

At 37st, Stuart Eggleshaw regularly felt embarrassment when he couldn’t fit through turnstiles as he followed his beloved Mansfield Town around the country, but it was a minor car crash that finally forced him to face up to his size.

It motivated him to lose 22st 9lbs and now he has been named Slimming World Greatest Loser 2014.

Stuart Eggleshaw used to struggle even to enter the stadium of his beloved football team due to his 37st frame

The 43-year-old, from Kirkby-in-Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, says: 'Luckily the incident wasn’t serious but the paramedics had to be called.

'It was then I realised that if the accident had been more serious and I’d been injured they probably would have found me very difficult to treat.

'I started asking myself, "would they have been able to get me out of the car?", "would they have been able to lift me into the ambulance?", "would they have needed specialist equipment?" and lots of other questions like that. 

'I realised that any or all of those things could have prevented them from getting me to hospital in time and, ultimately, from saving my life. That was really my wake-up call and I joined Slimming World soon afterwards.'

Stuart, who is single, struggled with 
his weight from a young age but remembers his size increasing rapidly 
around eight years ago.

He 
says: 'I was always described as "big-boned", but when I hit 35 it seems
 like I was always having to buy bigger and bigger clothes.

Stuart dropped from 37st to 14st 5lb in 16 months to be crowned Slimming World's Greatest Loser

Breakfast: Three rashers of fried bacon, three fried sausages, two fried eggs, two slices of toast or a large cob (bread roll)

Lunch: Two large cobs or bread rolls with coronation chicken, a large bag of crisps and various chocolate bars

Dinner: Two chicken tikka slices (pasty filled with chicken tikka), two or three packets of ready-made sandwiches, a share bag of crisps

Snacks: Various chocolate bars throughout the day

Breakfast: 35g cereal with berries

Mid-morning: Two bananas

Lunch: Jacket potato and baked beans with lots of fresh salad

Mid-afternoon: Tubs of prepared fresh fruit, such as mango, melon and pineapple

Dinner: Grilled chicken breast, boiled rice, carrots, green beans, broccoli and cauliflower

Snacks: A small chocolate bar, three Babybel light cheese, pickled onions

'I tried going to the gym to lose 
weight but it never seemed to shift because I wasn’t changing my eating 
habits, and in the end I stopped going.'

After
 his accident in August 2012, Stuart’s sister and stepmother recommended
 Slimming World and – with some trepidation – he joined a nearby group 
in Sutton-in-Ashfield the following month.

He
 says: 'I was very apprehensive about walking into the group on that 
first night as I knew there’d probably be lots of women and not very 
many men, but everyone was friendly and I got a warm welcome.

'I can’t speak highly enough of the 
whole experience and I’ve had so much support from my consultant Annette
 and the rest of the group.

I’m always encouraging other men to join now and one of my male colleagues has even lost 3st.'

Civil servant Stuart, who works for HM Revenue & Customs, started following the club’s Food Optimising healthy eating plan.

Instead of tucking into convenience foods, he began planning his meals and making time to cook from scratch.

He says he has rediscovered his love of cooking: 'I was pleasantly surprised when Annette explained the plan.

'I
 was amazed at the variety of foods that I could eat without having to 
restrict my portions and was delighted that I could still enjoy all my 
favourite meals just by making changes to the way I prepared and cooked 
them. Currently my favourite meal is a Malaysian chicken curry.'

As the weight came off Stuart decided to start being more active and now loves running, cycling and playing football.

He says: 'Before I joined Slimming 
World I would park the car as close to wherever I was going as humanly 
possible because I found walking just short distances very difficult.

'Now
 I cycle around 40 miles a week, run around 15 miles a week and play 
five-a-side football twice a week – and I love it. I’m hoping to do a 
half marathon next year and would like to enter a triathlon too.

'I’ve
 got two nephews who I’m much closer to now because I can run around 
with them and do more adventurous things like visit theme parks and take
 them on holiday.'

This January, just 16 months after joining Slimming World, Stuart hit his target weight of 14st 5lbs.

He’s dropped 34in  from his waist, going from 70in to 36in, and lost 14in from his collar measurement too.

Height: 6’/1.83m

Weight loss: 22st 9lbs/ 317lbs

Starting weight: 37st/ 518lbs

Current weight: 14st 5lbs/ 201lbs

Starting waist measurement: 70in /177.8cm

Current waist measurement: 36in/91.5cm

Date joined Slimming World: 12/09/2012

Today he’s been recognised for his incredible achievement by being named Slimming World Greatest Loser 2014, an award which is given to the Slimming World member from across the UK and Ireland who loses the most weight.

Stuart, who works the scoreboard at Mansfield Town’s One Call Stadium, says: 'I used to struggle to fit through the turnstiles but now I go through them with ease – and a big smile on my face.

'In fact there are so many things I can do that I couldn’t have even attempted when I was bigger – playing football with my nephews, buying clothes on the high street, flying on a plane without having to ask for a seatbelt extension and much more.

'Life is immeasurably better and I enjoy every moment. Now I’m ready for the next chapter of my life which will hopefully involve meeting someone to share all this with and starting a family.'
