Joe Arpaio (pictured here in 2004) has asked US Attorney General Eric Holder for £38million dollars after his department was found guilty of singling out Latinos for traffic and immigration stops

America's self-proclaimed toughest sheriff has asked the federal government for $38million claiming they gave his officers faulty immigration training.Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who became famous for his zero tolerance policy on immigration, was found guilty in May of singling out Latinos in traffic stops and detaining them for unreasonably long times.But he has now claimed Washington owes him $38million after it provided faulty training, teaching his deputies it was acceptable to use race as grounds for a traffic stop or immigration check.

In an open letter to Eric Holder, the Attorney General, Arpaio asked for $30 million in compliance costs - including fitting cameras to officer's cars, retraining deputies, and hiring a court monitor to track the department's activities - $1.2 million in legal fees for his defence, and more than $7 million in legal fees being sought by the lawyers who won the case.In May, U.S. District Judge Murray Snow ruled Arpaio's office systematically singled out Latinos in its regular traffic and immigration patrols. Arpaio disputes the finding and has appealed the decision.Cecillia Wang, a lawyer who brought the case on behalf of the Latino community, told Fox News: 'It's a complete whitewash for the sheriff to claim that the federal government is the one to blame.'

Arpaio is claiming that Washington has 
backed out of a pledge to pay the legal costs of 100 deputies who were 
once given the authority to make federal immigration stops and were 
trained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Arpaio, who began the first female chain gang (pictured), claims his officers were given faulty federal immigration training and that Washington should now pay for the cost of complying with new regulations, his defence lawyers, and costs sought by the prosecution

However, after the power to make federal immigration stops was withdrawn, Arpaio continued to make stops under state law, and announced he would be training all 881 officer to made the checks.Judge Murray Snow's ruling doesn't altogether bar Arpaio from enforcing the state's immigration laws, but it does impose a long list of restrictions on the sheriff's patrols, some of which focused heavily on Latino areas in the county.The ruling prohibited the selection of ‘particular communities, locations or geographic areas for targeted traffic enforcement based to any degree on the racial or ethnic composition of the community.’The order also prohibits using race as a factor in deciding whether to stop a vehicle with a Latino occupant or detaining Latino passengers only on the suspicion that they're in the country illegally.
