Fraudster: NHS worker Fiona Gillen, pictured outside Dundee Sheriff Court yesterday, was sentenced to 150 hours unpaid community work

An NHS worker who lied about the death of her father in order to claim paid leave was yesterday spared a jail sentence for fraud.

Fiona Gillen, 45, told her bosses he had passed away and she needed time off to attend his funeral in England.

But it later emerged he was alive and knew nothing of the scam.

At Dundee Sheriff Court, Gillen pleaded guilty to two charges of obtaining money by fraud from NHS Tayside between March 9, 2011 and April 22, 2011.

Yesterday, Sheriff George Way told Gillen, of Alyth, Perthshire, that she had ‘breached trust’ – but would not go to jail over the fraud.

He said: ‘She’s a first offender and has lost a great deal through all  of this.

‘The sums of money at stake make it clear that for a first offender there would have to be more involved for a custodial sentence.

‘Taking into account the fact there was a breach of trust – she was expected by her employers to tell the truth – I will impose a community payback order with 150 hours unpaid work.’

Gillen had worked as an administrator at the Scottish Bowel Screening Centre at Dundee’s Kings Cross Hospital.

In March 2011, she went to her supervisor Linda Brownlee and told her that her father Patrick had died and she needed time off to attend the funeral in Ipswich, Suffolk.

Taking advantage of sympathetic colleagues, she then spun out several more weeks of paid leave.

Following the invented burial service, Gillen told her boss she was suffering from stress as a result of her father’s death.

She even managed to produce medical certificates from her doctor, who diagnosed ‘bereavement reaction’, to support her story.

Gillen kept the scam up for  more than a month before she was found out.

A source said: ‘Eventually, red flags were raised and an investigation was launched. There was no record of a Patrick Gillen dying in the Ipswich area, as she had claimed.

Lies: Ms Gillen told bosses at Dundee's King Cross Hospital, pictured, that she needed time off to attend her father's funeral despite the fact he was very much alive and well

‘An investigator managed to track him down and he said he hadn’t seen Fiona for over 18 months before this all happened.’

Gillen was later dismissed from her job and now works as a housekeeper.

The court heard she ‘knew her father’s death was fictitious’ and had invented the tale to get NHS Tayside to pay her despite her not being at work.

Mr Gillen, of Felixstowe in Suffolk, said after a previous court appearance: ‘We are a little estranged from our daughter. She lives her own life, like a lot of children these days. We still love our daughter and would like her to get in touch with us. We have no way of getting in touch with her.

‘We are just very sad about it all. We are sad about the state she seems to have got herself into.’Earlier this year, a social worker who lied about six of her relatives dying within two years in order to get paid leave was struck off.

Rachael Miles claimed that her father, mother, aunt, uncle, brother and ex-husband had all died, thus obtaining 66 days paid leave from Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council.

A Health and Care Professions Council hearing found that she had provided ‘misleading information’ for a number of absences and retained payments for compassionate leave.

Panel chairman Alexander Yule said she had shown ‘little remorse’ and that her fraud was particularly damaging as she should have been helping ‘vulnerable individuals’.
