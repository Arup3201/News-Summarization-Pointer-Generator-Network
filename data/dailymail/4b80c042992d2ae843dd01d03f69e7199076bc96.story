Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao still 'has faith' that he could stay with the Old Trafford club next season.

The Colombia international has managed just four goals in 19 games for Louis van Gaal’s side this season and is expected to return to Monaco before considering other potential loans to Juventus, Valencia or Real Madrid.

The 29-year-old has been on form for his country in the last five days, scoring three times in two games, albeit against Bahrain and Kuwait, to equal Colombia’s all-time goalscoring record with 24 goals.

After scoring a penalty in the 3-1 win over Kuwait, Falcao was asked if he expected to stay at Manchester United and replied: 'I have faith about that and when the season finishes I am going to sit down and think about my future and what is the best for my career.

'I think when I score it's always important and that gives me confidence,' he added. 'I said before I need minutes, I need to play games in a row and here in the national team I have had the opportunity. I gave my best and I scored and I now return to Manchester with more confidence.

'We have the last eight games, I will give my best to have the chance to play as many minutes as possible.

'I have said before I need to play, I need minutes and I am confident about me, about my fitness. I am confident.'

United scouts will attend Tuesday's match between Holland and Spain with PSV Eindhoven winger Memphis Depay among the players they intend to watch.

Depay is also attracting attention from Manchester City and Liverpool but his agent Kees Ploegsma said: 'There has been a lot of rumours, but he still has a contract with PSV, so for now he is in Eindhoven. We have not been in contact with any clubs.

'They (Depay and Van Gaal) had good contact during the World Cup, but since then there has been no contact.'

Paris St Germain are continuing to monitor developments with United's unsettled winger Angel di Maria but United do not intend to sell their record signing.
