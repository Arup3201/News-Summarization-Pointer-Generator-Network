Ranvir Bassi was overcome by her 'mother's instinct' when an armed robber burst into her shop

The odds were not in her favour. 
Shopkeeper and mother Ranvir Bassi shouldn’t have stood a chance when a 
hooded raider pushed a sawn-off shotgun in her face.

But it was the gunman who ended up running.

Dramatic CCTV images show Mrs Bassi, 
at just 5ft 2in tall, grabbing the gun and grappling with the would-be 
robber until he turned tail and fled.

Mrs Bassi, 35, said her ‘mother’s 
instinct’ kicked in when the thug burst into her shop with the weapon as
 her seven-year-old daughter Satpreet cowered beneath the counter.

The footage shows the gunman pointing a
 2ft long single-barrel weapon directly at Ranvir.

He was also clutching
 a yellow carrier bag into which she was supposed to put the cash.

‘It was just horrific,’ said 
mother-of-two Mrs Bassi.

‘I  was shutting down the shop and he just 
burst in waving the  gun around.

‘He started shouting “Give me the 
money” and swearing at me.

'I really don’t know why I did it, but I guess
 my mother’s instinct took over. My daughter was hiding and I just 
grabbed the gun.

‘I just shouted “Get out of my shop” and started shoving him. I must have startled him because he turned and ran.

‘He just picked the wrong day to mess 
with me – but I was determined that I wasn’t going to hand over money I 
had been working hard all day for.’

Mrs Bassi, 35, was shutting the shop in Stafford ten minutes early to visit her son Gurdip, eight, who was in hospital.

Her husband Parmjit, 32, was at home at the time of the attack, and she says they have all been left shocked by what happened.

The family have run the store for 19 years but insist they will not be forced out by the terrifying raid.

Mrs Bassi was back at the store to open up as normal the following morning.

But rather than cowering in fear and handing over her takings the 5ft 2in mother of two grabs the weapon

'He just picked the wrong day to mess with me,' said Mrs Bassi of the moment she fought off the robber

The robber, evidently startled by the shopkeeper's tenacity, turns tail and runs out of the shop

‘It’s our livelihood,’ she said. ‘If 
we didn’t open up, we’d lose money. We will not be moved – we are a 
close-knit community and we won’t be driven out by thugs like him.’

The couple open their convenience store 14 hours a day, seven days a week, closing only at Christmas. It is covered by seven CCTV cameras.

Mrs Bassi said that, while she is determined to carry on as normal, Satpreet has been having nightmares and has stopped eating.

Satpreet and Gurdip, who was 
discharged from hospital after treatment for a severe eye infection on 
Tuesday, often sit in the back room of the shop to do their homework.

But Satpreet is now on edge whenever a male customer walks through the door, her mother said.

Yesterday, customer Richard Fenn, 69, told Mrs Bassi: ‘Well done – remind me not to argue with you!’  He added: ‘I don’t think I would have acted like that.’

Mrs Bassi said other customers in the close-knit community had been in to present her with bunches of flowers. She added: ‘I know all the customers’ names. They have all been so supportive.’

Ranvir Bassi said her daughter still cannot sleep after the 'terrifying' incident

Bassi & Son Newsagents in Stafford was targeted on Monday shortly after 8.20pm. Police are appealing for information about the incident

The attempted robbery was the first 
crime other than shoplifting which the Bassis have experienced at the 
business since they took charge of it in 2004.

For the decade previously it had been run by her parents.

Yesterday police swooped on an address 50 yards from the shop and arrested a youth of 17 on suspicion of attempted robbery.
