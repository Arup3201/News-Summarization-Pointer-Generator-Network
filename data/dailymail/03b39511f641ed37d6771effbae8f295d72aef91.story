A drug dealer was caught by police after he posed for a picture next to his crop of cannabis plants - and then used it as his mobile phone screensaver.

Nicholas Waine, 27, thought he was so untouchable he grinned for the incriminating snap as he was harvesting a marijuana farm he was growing in a suburban house.

But the smile was wiped off his face after police seized his mobile phone during raids and spotted the photo of him sat on a stool and grinning for ear to ear as he held out his yield with a pair of scissors placed on his lap.

Busted: Nicholas Waine, 27, has been jailed for conspiracy to supply drugs after police found this picture of him covered in cannabis on his mobile phone

It emerged he had served a previous prison stretch for robbery after he was a member of a gang which robbed a branch of the Halifax bank while armed with a Samurai sword.

Officers have now revealed how they used the drugs image to help put Waine behind bars for a further four years and eight months.

His partner-in-crime Jack Yarwood, 28, was also jailed for four years and eight months. Their accomplice Wayne Keron, 49, was jailed for two years.

All admitted conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and Yarwood also pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis with intent to supply.

Police said Yarwood and Waine, both 
from Sale, Greater Manchester, were well-known drug dealers in the 
suburb andy used Keron’s home as a hideout to cut up the drugs.

But
 their crime empire began to crumble in May 2012 when police found an 
abandoned silver Mazda that had been crashed on a street.

Inside were two mobile phones belonging to Waine and Yarwood containing text messages about previous drug deals, along with a drug debtors list.

Officers then raided Yarwood’s home, where officers found cannabis stashed in a black bin bag in the freezer. They also found cocaine in Yarwood’s trousers, a jacket hanging up in the hall and on a shelf in a kitchen cupboard. Another debtors list was concealed in the boiler cupboard.

More mobile phones were also found showing that Waine and Yarwood were involved in dealing drugs.

 been sentenced to another four years and eight months in prison for 
conspiracy to supply drugs

As the investigation unfolded in the coming months, officers acting on a tip off raided Keron’s home on 22 February 2013.

As
 officers went through the door, Keron, Waine and Yarwood were found sitting
 around a jug full of white powder - approximately 1/4kg - which was 
later revealed to be cocaine cut with an adulterant called benzocaine.

Further
 evidence was found throughout the house that the trio had been cutting 
up drugs, including a blender and a drugs press. Waine and Yarwood’s 
fingerprints were found on a number of the items.

In
 one of the bedrooms, officers found further bags of cocaine, cannabis 
and electronic scales and a large amount of benzocaine, indicating the 
group intended to continue cutting drugs at the address.

More
 mobile phones were also seized showing an extensive drug dealing 
business. They included Waine’s personal phone which was found to have 
the incriminating image.

In
 2006, Waine was sentenced to five years four months after he pleaded 
guilty to robbery. He had also been quizzed over an attack on a football
 fan in a pub in which a stool was thrown at his head resulting in him 
requiring eight stitches.

After
 a hearing at Minshull Street Crown Court today, Manchester, Det Sgt 
Patrick Goodrich of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Waine and Yarwood 
were well-known drug dealers in this area.

'From
 the overwhelming amount of evidence we recovered, it was clear they ran
 an extensive and potentially lucrative drug-dealing operation.

'They used Keron’s home as their hideout from which to cut up the drugs into smaller quantities and sell on to make significant profit.

'And when we went through the doors, we quite literally caught these men red-handed, with fingerprints all over the drugs and cutting paraphernalia.

'Mobile phone analysis not only showed that Waine and Yarwood were close friends, but the sheer volume of text messages about drug debts and deals showed this sort of criminality was their way of life, and their way of making money.

'These convictions are a fantastic result for Greater Manchester Police because two determined drug dealers are now behind bars, but more than anything it is a victory for the community who, for too long, have had to put up with the likes of Yarwood and Waine mistakenly thinking that can "run" this part of Sale West and act with impunity.

'Drug dealers like these can all too often cause misery and hardship among law-abiding residents who may be too scared to speak up for fear of reprisals.

'With these men off the streets, we have not only made a huge dent into the supply of drugs in this area but also sent a powerful message that no-one is above the law.

'Greater Manchester Police will work hand-in-hand with residents to remove these corrosive elements from our communities and make them safer places.'
