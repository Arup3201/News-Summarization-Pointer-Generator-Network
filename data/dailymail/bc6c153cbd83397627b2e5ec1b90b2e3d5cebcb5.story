A social worker admitted yesterday she had ‘failed’ a housebound pensioner who died after being left without food or medication for nine days – because the 81-year-old was well off.

Gloria Foster, who funded her own care, was assumed to be able to make other arrangements when the agency that visited her four times a day was shut by immigration officials.

The dementia sufferer, who did not know the agency had been closed, was found dying after nine days by a nurse, dehydrated and starving.

Mrs Foster, from Banstead, Surrey, died 11 days later on February 2 in Epsom Hospital. 

An inquest heard council staff failed to arrange alternative care for her after the UK Border Agency raided the Carefirst24 agency. 

Social worker Elizabeth Egan said she did not realise Mrs Foster had dementia, and claimed she only tried to call her once to let her know that the agency had been shut down, but didn’t get through.

She said she only made a record of the call after Mrs Foster was found dying because she was too busy at the time. Police said phone records indicated that no such call took place.

When Carefirst24 closed, Mrs Egan was told to find replacement carers for the firm’s customers, even though she was suffering from depression and had told her bosses at Surrey social services she was not coping.

The 81-year-old (left) was left in her home for nine days before a nurse found her dehydrated, hungry and soaked in urine 

She told Surrey Coroner’s Court that she was ‘reaching the point of burn-out’ at the time and had made a ‘judgment error’.

The agency's owners appeared in court accused of employing workers without visas 

Mrs Egan said people who funded their own care were often thought to be able to look after their own arrangements, adding: ‘There is an assumption which is wrong – and I think I made that as well – that they can manage their own care or have help from someone else to arrange it.

‘I tried to ring the lady. I didn’t get any reply. I didn’t follow it up. I don’t think I was even thinking straight. 

'There was too much happening. The bottom line is that I failed. I made a mistake. I wasn’t in a fit state to take on any extra work.’

Nurse Rosemary Greig, who called at Mrs Foster’s home to carry out a blood test on January 24, found her fully clothed and lying across her bed, soaked in urine. 

The Woking inquest was told the widow died from pulmonary thrombo-embolism and deep vein thrombosis. Coroner Richard Travers will record his verdict next week.

Meanwhile, the married owners of Carefirst24 appeared at Croydon Crown Court yesterday accused of illegally employing workers without visas. 

Mahendrasing Caussyram, 49, and Saraspedy Caussyram, 52, of Sutton, Surrey, denied the charge, and another of conspiring to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property.
