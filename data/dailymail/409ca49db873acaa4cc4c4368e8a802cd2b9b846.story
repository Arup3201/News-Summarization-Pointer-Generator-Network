Coleen Rooney has 
worked diligently to get her figure back to peak condition since the 
birth of her second son in May, and the results speak for themselves.

There is no doubt that the 27-year-old Liverpudlian has been showcasing a super slim figure of late.

And now, Wayne Rooney's wife has revealed the secret weapon she used to shift her 'mummy tummy'.

The mother-of-two is currently using Technoshape - a fat-blitzing stomach belt - to rid her post baby stomach after giving birth to baby Klay back in May, which can be worn whilst working out on a treadmill or bike.

Coleen has signed up for a course of sessions using the machine, which has been dubbed a 'non-surgical tummy tuck', after it was recommended to her by her personal trainer, Elise Lindsay.

A spokesman for the exercise machine, which costs £37 per session, said: 'Alongside her usual aerobic workout, Coleen Rooney is using Technoshape to enhance the fat-burning process around her tummy. 

'Coleen was introduced to Technoshape by Elise Lindsay. 
She is using the machine for her mummy tummy, which is exactly the kind 
of thing it was designed for.

'Coleen opted to buy the machine for her 
private gym, rather than use publicly. She refused to go to any fitness 
studio - most local studios don’t have the equipment yet and she wasn’t 
going to go to somewhere as far away as London.

'It’s mainly the rich and
famous who buy the equipment because they don’t want to be seen using 
it.

'But it is a wonderful experience and if you have a long T-shirt on 
you can barely see the chamber belt.'

Coleen tweeted about the machine last week, writing: 'First @techno_shape session with @EliseLindsay77 this morning!!

'Love it already...Bye bye bye belly!!! #fingerscrossed'.

Technoshape claims to be a unique device because it uses 'Pressure Pause Therapy' to stimulate circulation and enhance fat-burning around the midriff area, as well as supporting the natural movement of the 
digestive system and increasing circulation.

Technoshape, which is also used by the likes of Lisa Snowdon, Millie Mackintosh and Peter Andre, also claims to show results in just three 40-minute sessions per week.

Whilst celebrities were recently caught up in the 'cash for tweet' scandal, where it was claimed that they were paid to plug brands via Twitter, Technoshape maintain that this isn't the case with Coleen and she is a genuine fan of the brand.

This isn't the first time that Coleen has turned to extreme measures to shift the pounds.

In June she revealed that she got in shape for a friend's wedding by embarking on a gruelling juice diet.
