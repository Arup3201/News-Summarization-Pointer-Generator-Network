Police are investigating alleged racist comments branding Ashley Cole a ‘choc ice’ for supporting team-mate John Terry in court.

A Twitter user wrote the term in a message shared with more than three million on the social network by Rio Ferdinand.

The Manchester United defender, whose brother Anton was at the centre of the trial in which Terry was cleared of racism last week, added: ‘I hear you fella! Choc ice is classic hahahahahaha!!’

Laughing off: Rio Ferdinand appears to endorse the tweet branding Ashley Cole a 'choc ice' by responding: 'I hear you fella! Choc ice is classic. Hahahahahahhha!!'

Denial: Ferdinand later tweeted: 'What I said yesterday is not a racist term. It’s a type of slang/term used by many for someone who is being fake. So there'

Derbyshire Police confirmed last night
it was investigating the original tweet, made by someone in the county,
after receiving several complaints. They confirmed Ferdinand's reply was not being investigated.

Both footballers have moved to 
defuse the row, saying the comment had been taken out of context.

Ferdinand, who was quick to delete the
tweet after receiving a barrage of criticism, took to the network again
to say his words were ‘sarcasm’.

He wrote: ‘What I said yesterday is 
not a racist term. It’s a type of slang/term used by many for someone 
who is being fake. So there.’

Cole insisted the pair were ‘good friends’ and said he did not intend to make ‘any sort of complaint’.

The incident comes after Chelsea 
captain John Terry was cleared of a racially aggravated public order 
offence at Westminster Magistrates’ Court last week.

It was alleged Terry had maliciously called Rio’s brother Anton a 'f****** black c***' during a game last October.

Ashley Cole, 31, had told the trial that Terry, his Stamford Bridge captain, was not racist.

The 'choc ice' term is understood to mean 'black on the outside, white on the inside.'

A spokeswoman for Derbyshire 
Constabulary said: 'We have received complaints from members of the 
public regarding alleged racist comments made on a social networking 
site.

'These concerns will be fully investigated to establish whether any criminal offences have been committed.'

Cole moved to calm the situation at the weekend after users began discussing the comments and reacting to them.

In a statement issued through his lawyers, the footballer said: 'Ashley Cole has been made aware of the discussion following comments appearing on 
Twitter and wishes to make it clear that he and Rio Ferdinand are good 
friends and Ashley has no intention of making any sort of complaint.

'Ashley appreciates that Tweeting is so quick it often results in off-hand and stray comments.'

Ferdinand later tweeted: 'What I said yesterday is not a racist term. It’s a type of slang/term used by many for someone who is being fake. So there.'

A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police said the force was not investigating the comments made by Ferdinand.

When giving evidence for the defence during the trial, Cole said it was wrong to prosecute Terry.

'We shouldn’t be sitting here,’ Cole said.

He said that while racism should never be tolerated, saying back what you thought someone said was ‘completely different’.

Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle said an acquittal on the racially aggravated public order offence was the only verdict he could reach because there was no way to be sure what Terry had said.
