Police are hunting a vandal who stole a Mrs Santa Claus figure from an elderly couple’s garden - before cutting its head off.

CCTV captured the moment the thug took the 4ft-high Mrs Christmas from outside Gertie and John Garner’s home in a midnight raid.

In the video the yob can be heard laughing as he rips the head off the festive figure before throwing the body parts into the garden.

The intruder struck just after midnight on Tuesday, just hours after the couple had adorned their three-bedroom home in Grantham, Lincolnshire, with Christmas decorations for their disabled son, Christopher.

Devastated Gertie, 78, said: 'It was the first night we’d lit it all up.

'I do it every year for my son Christopher who is severely disabled because he loves lights.

'It was his carers who found out what had happened first when they came to get my son out of bed.

'A lot of people get a lot of enjoyment out of the decorations so I don’t see why they can’t just leave them alone.

'What sort of person beheads a figure of Mrs Christmas? It’s like something straight out of the Grinch.

'We will not be beaten by this senseless attack and are already planning bigger and better decorations.'

The couple, who have four grown-up 
children, 16 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren, put security 
cameras outside their home three years ago after a spate of vandalism 
but this is the first time anyone has targeted their festive display.

Gertie added: 'We used to put little 
ornaments on the wall but they kept getting stolen so we glued them 
instead but then they were smashed.

'The amount of people who stop and look at the decorations is unbelievable.

'People say we should do it for charity but where would people put their money? It would just disappear.'

Lincolnshire Police confirmed they were investigating the attack.
