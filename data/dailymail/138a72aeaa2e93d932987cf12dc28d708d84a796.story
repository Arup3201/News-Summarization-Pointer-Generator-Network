Jail: Michelle Martin, ex-wife of Belgian serial killer husband Marc Dutroux

The 'remorseless' ex-wife of one of Europe's most reviled child killers is to be released from prison to spend the next ten years 'at prayer' in a convent.

Michelle Martin, 52, has served 16 years of 30-year jail term for complicity in the imprisonment and murder of the young victims of Belgian serial killer husband Marc Dutroux.

Families of Dutroux's victims have branded the ruling by the Belgian court in Mons as 'an outrage'.

Dutroux was arrested in 1996 and jailed for life in June 2004 for the kidnap, rape and torture of six young girls in the mid-1990s, four of whom died.

Martin was also arrested in 1996 and later found guilty of helping Dutroux hold his victims prisoner.

She was also convicted of complicity in the death of two of the small girls, found starved to death in a cellar in the southern city of Charleroi.

The traumatic case is still fresh in the minds of many in Belgium, which is also reeling from a Catholic church child abuse scandal involving more than 500 victims.

Under Belgian law, convicts can appeal for early release after serving a third of their sentence.

Martin has repeatedly requested to be freed to live in a convent but until now nuns in France and Belgium had all refused to house her.

Move: Martin has repeatedly requested to be freed to live in a convent but they refused to house her. Now she has been accepted at the Clarisses monastery in the city of Malonne - just 45 miles from the scene of her crimes

Child killer: Dutroux was first detained for the child abductions in 1996 but not convicted until 2004

Now she has been accepted at the Clarisses monastery in the city of Malonne - just 45 miles from the scene of her crimes.

Horrified Jean-Denis Lejeune, father of Julie Lejeune, one of the two eight-year-olds found in Dutroux's cellar, said: 'No one has consulted us, and now she will be living as a virtually free woman just 60 kilometres away.

'Legally we are powerless to do anything about this. The rights of the victims' families are being trampled all over by the law.'

The family of victim Eefje Lambrecks 
said they were strongly opposed to Martin's release because 'she had 
never voiced any sincere regrets'.

Psychiatrists have also warned officials that Martin could still present a danger to society, the Belgian media reported.

The Dutroux affair emerged in 1996, when police arrested him following the abduction of 14-year-old Laetitia Delhez, right. She was found alive two days later along with severely emaciated Sabine Dardenne, left 12, in the basement of his house in the Charleroi suburb of Marcinelle (both pictured in 2004)

Martin
must live under strict conditions while resident at the convent, 
including not attempting to contact any of the victims' families or 
friends, and not speaking to the media about her crimes.

She
would only be allowed out of the confines of the convent under strict 
supervision of nuns and probation workers, officials said.

But in ten years time she will be eligible for full release into the community, the court ruled.

The
Dutroux affair erupted in August, 1996, when police arrested the 
unemployed electrician following the abduction of 14-year-old girl 
Laetitia Delhez.

She was found alive two days later along with severely emaciated Sabine Dardenne, 12, in the basement of his house the Charleroi suburb of Marcinelle.

Then in August, 1998, the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo were found buried in the garden of Dutroux's other home in the southern town of Sars La Buissiere.

A month later, the bodies of An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks were found in another property owned by Dutroux.

Leaving: Michelle Martin was being held in Berkendael-Berkendaal in Brussels

Public anger increased when came to light that police had missed a string of clues that could have led to Dutroux being apprehended earlier.

It also emerged that he had been released from jail in 1992 after serving just three years of a 13-year sentence for the abduction and rape of five girls.

Nationwide fury boiled over and more than 300,000 people took to the streets of Brussels in October 1996 in a series of marches to protest at judicial incompetence.
