For years, officials have denied that exams are getting easier, insisting students have worked hard for their improving grades.

Now the head of the UK’s largest examination board has become the latest to cast doubt over A-level and GCSE standards.

Rod Bristow, president of Pearson UK, which owns Edexcel, said that boards should be ‘worried’ about the pattern of ever improving results.

His comments come just weeks after Glenys Stacey, chief executive of exam regulator Ofqual, admitted that A-levels and GCSEs had suffered ‘persistent grade inflation’ for ‘at least a decade’.

Easy deal? But exams are set to get tougher after years of easier tests

Speaking to the Times Educational Supplement, Mr Bristow stopped  short of agreeing there had been grade inflation.

But he said: ‘We have seen improvements in grades in GCSEs and  A-levels in the past ten years – that  is indisputable.

‘We have not seen increases in our performance on international benchmarks, nothing to do with rankings – the actual scores haven’t improved.

‘That must tell you that there is an issue we need to look at, to be worried about.’

A report published on Monday by Pearson, which acquired Edexcel in 2005, called for a strict cap to be placed on the number of GCSEs taken by school children amid claims that exam overload was damaging pupils’ education.

It said limits should be introduced to ensure pupils sat no more than eight to ten GCSEs.

It came after experts warned that teenagers were collecting GCSEs like ‘Scout badges’.

The Pearson report also outlined plans for a new generation of tougher A-levels, which ‘set the bar higher’ with longer, essay-style questions.

Exam board officials have previously defended standards, insisting that year-on-year grade improvements were due to students’ hard work. However, all the exam boards have come under Government pressure recently after allegations of a ‘cosy collusion’ with schools, including in the running of exam seminars.

A newspaper investigation last December revealed how seminars were giving teachers vital information about papers. It also exposed one of the chief examiners at Edexcel boasting about how the board had managed to clear easy exams with Ofqual.

Steph Warren, a senior official at Edexcel, told an undercover reporter, posing as a geography teacher considering using the firm’s GCSE exams, that ‘you don’t have to teach a lot’.  Another Edexcel English official boasted about how, thanks to easy coursework, ‘weak kids’ could get through ‘on anything really’.

Easy: Ofqual has announced plans to reduce the number of 'soft' subjects on offer and to axe 'F' and 'G' grades

Ofqual recently announced it was banning thousands of exam seminars, which posed ‘unacceptable risks’ to the integrity of the system.

Some teachers expected to receive ‘privileged information’ about exams, it claimed.

Yesterday, the regulator announced plans to change GCSE grading and reduce the number of ‘soft’ subjects on offer.

Discredited ‘F’ and ‘G’ grades are likely to be axed, while dozens of subjects, such as leisure and tourism, and hospitality face being stripped of their GCSE status.

Ofqual admitted it was looking at ways of ‘containing’ grade inflation over the next four years.
