The boy was taken to Wollongong Hospital after paramedics were called and he was later airlifted to  Sydney Children's Hospital at Randwick, where he underwent surgery.

This incident was the latest in a spate of reported dog attacks on young children in the Bellambi area on Tuesday.

NSW Ambulance Illawarra district inspector Terry Morrow confirmed paramedics received two unrelated dog attack reports in the area, neither matching the incident reported by police, reported the Illawarra Mercury.

Also at Waley Avenue, paramedics attended an 11-year-old who had be bitten by a small dog, and the child was taken to Wollongong Hospital with minimal bleeding and a few small puncture wounds, Mr Morrow said.

After a dog bit a 10-year-old on the buttocks, the child went to Wollongong following the attack in Bellambi’s Whitby Mews, also on Tuesday.

For treatment of a small wound, the child was transferred to Sydney Children’s Hospital by road ambulance.
