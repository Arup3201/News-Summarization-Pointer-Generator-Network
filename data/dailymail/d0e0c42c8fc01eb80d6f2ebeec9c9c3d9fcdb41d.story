Susie Wolff has been promoted to official test driver for Williams for the 2015 Formula One season.

Stepping up from her previous role as development driver, Wolff takes over from Felipe Nasr who will drive for Sauber next year.

Wolff will take part in two first practice sessions at races to be determined, two test days, as well conducting extensive simulator testing to help in the ongoing development of the team's cars.

It also means if Valtteri Bottas or Felipe Massa were to miss a race for any reason, the 31-year-old Scot would be first choice to step into the seat.

Earlier this year Wolff became the first female driver to take part in a grand prix weekend for two decades when she drove in first practice ahead of the races in Britain and Germany.

Speaking about her new role, Wolff - who is married to Mercedes executive director Toto Wolff - said: 'This is another step in the right direction for me.

'I am delighted Williams are recognising my progression, hard work and it is performance that counts.

'Williams is at a very exciting stage in its history and we are moving into 2015 with fantastic momentum. I'm proud to be part of the team.'

Deputy team principal Claire Williams feels Wolff is deserving of the role on merit, saying: 'She continues to impress us with her strong technical knowledge, feedback she delivers and the performance when she drives the car both on the track and in the simulator.

'She has steadily increased her time behind the wheel since she joined us in April 2012 and her appointment as official test driver was a natural progression.

'We have a very strong and stable driver line-up for 2015 and this will be a key asset as we look to build on a positive 2014 season.'

She became the first female driver to take part in a grand prix weekend for two decades earlier this year
