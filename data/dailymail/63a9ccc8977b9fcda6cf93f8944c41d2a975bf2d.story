Outgoing North Carolina Governor Beverly Perdue has pardoned the Wilmington 10, a group wrongly convicted 40 years ago of firebombing a local grocery store after police shot a black teenager.

Nine black men and one white woman were given prison sentences totaling nearly 300 years in the notorious Civil Rights-era prosecution that led to accusations that the state was holding political prisoners.

Perdue issued pardons of innocence today, which means the state no longer considers the 10 - four of whom have since died - guilty of a crime.

'I have decided to grant these pardons because the more facts I have learned about the Wilmington 10, the more appalled I have become about the manner in which their convictions were obtained,' Perdue said in a news release.

The three key witnesses in the case later recanted their testimony in the 1971 firebombing. Amnesty International and other groups took up the issue, portraying the Wilmington 10 as political prisoners.

In 1978, then-Gov. Jim Hunt commuted their sentences but withheld a pardon. Two years later, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., threw out the convictions, saying perjury and prosecutorial misconduct were factors in the verdicts.

'We are tremendously grateful to Gov.
Perdue for her courage,' said Benjamin Chavis, the former national 
NAACP executive director who was in jail and prison for about five years
before his release.

'This
is a historic day for North Carolina and the United States. People 
should be innocent until proven guilty, not persecuted for standing up 
for equal rights and justice.'

In addition to Chavis, the surviving members of the Wilmington 10 are Reginald Epps, James McKoy, Wayne Moor, Marvin Patrick and Willie Earl Vereen. Those who have died are Jerry Jacobs, Ann Shepard, Connie Tindall and Joe Wright. Wright was the youngest, arrested when he was 16 years old.

The Wilmington 10 were convicted in 
October 1972 on charges of conspiracy to firebomb Mike's Grocery and 
conspiracy to assault emergency personnel who responded to the fire in 
February 1971.

The
trial was held in Burgaw in Pender County after a judge declared a 
mistrial the first time. A jury of 10 blacks and two whites had been 
seated in the first trial when prosecutor Jay Stroud said he was sick, 
and the judge declared the mistrial. At the second trial, a jury of 10 
whites and two blacks was seated.

The
three key witnesses who took the stand for the prosecution recanted 
their testimony in 1976. And the prosecutor, Stroud, became a flashpoint
for the Wilmington 10 supporters.

In November, NAACP state leaders said they believe newly uncovered notes show Stroud tried to keep blacks off the first jury and seat whites he thought were sympathetic to the Ku Klux Klan.

They showed the notes on a poster board, saying the handwriting on the legal paper appeared to match notes from other prosecution records in the case.

At the top of the list of 100 jurors, the notes said, 'stay away from black men.' A capital 'B' was beside the names of black jurors. The notes identify one potential black juror as an 'Uncle Tom type,' and beside the names of several white people, notations include 'KKK?' and 'good!!'

Stroud told the StarNews of Wilmington that he wrote the notes but declined to confirm that to the AP.'This conduct is disgraceful,' Perdue said of the notes.

'It is utterly incompatible with basic notions of fairness and with every ideal that North Carolina holds dear. The legitimacy of our criminal justice system hinges on it operating in a fair and equitable manner with justice being dispensed based on innocence or guilt - not based on race or other forms of prejudice.'
