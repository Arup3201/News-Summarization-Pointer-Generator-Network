Police are considering charging a Gold Coast man with the murder of an unborn child after he allegedly bludgeoned his pregnant partner to death.

Brock Wall, 34, is accused of attacking his partner, who was 10 weeks pregnant, with a tomahawk at an address in Varsity Lakes on Queensland's Gold Coast on Monday.

Wall has been charged with the murder of Fabiana Plahares, 35, but may also face a second charge for the death of her unborn child.

Friends alleged that Wall was the father of Ms Plahares baby, according to ABC News.

Ms Plahares uncle Leo Plahares spoke to Daily Mail Australia from Brazil on behalf of her family.

'We can not believe our darling girl is gone, leaving such a void in our hearts,' said Mr Plahares.

'Our Fabiana was such a special person, a person of great light.' 

'It is almost impossible to speak about it.'

'She was dearly loved by us and will be so greatly missed.'

'We feel nostalgic thinking about her infectious smile, she gave us so much joy.'

The case was mentioned at Southport Magistrates Court on Tuesday but Wall did not appear and no bail application was made.

Her partner and allegedly the father of her unborn child, Brock Wall, has been charged with her murder

In court, police prosecutor Donna Minns said it was likely Wall will be charged with killing an unborn child in the coming days. 

A committal hearing for Wall's case will be heard in May. 

The victim, Ms Plahares, had been living in Australia for ten years and ran her own cleaning company, according to ABC News.  

She was found in her home in Randwick Court, Varsity Lakes on Monday afternoon after the domestic incident.

It is believed that the police had been called to the house three weeks ago and according to a neighbour the couple had a history of domestic disputes.

Wall was located in a car reportedly covered in blood, around the corner from the house and has been charged with murder. 

He was put in a forensic evidence suit before being taken from the scene by police.  

'He drove down and around the corner and police intercepted him in a vehicle, a small white sedan,' Detective Inspector Hogan said.
