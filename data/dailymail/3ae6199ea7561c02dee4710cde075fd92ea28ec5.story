This is the terrifying moment when scores of hammerhead sharks swim peacefully past a group of scuba divers  just metres away.

The underwater footage shows around an estimate of 100 sharks swimming casually though the deep blue sea at South West Rocks on the mid-north coast of NSW.

Diving instructor, Steve Skinner who caught it on camera, told Daily Mail Australia that his closer encounter with the school of hammerheads couldn't deter him from his passion of diving.

'It was completely unexpected to see that many hammerheads around here but it was awesome and a pretty exciting day,' Skinner said. 

'We rarely get hammerheads in the area and it was a very off chance that they'd come around but I'm pretty happy about that.

'I was more concerned for a woman I was instructing during my course because she was a little scared but she thought it was pretty exciting too.'

Skinner, who has been diving for 18 years, said he hasn't had any 'scary moments' in his career.

'I'm usually not scared because I've been underwater for so long but a close encounter I had was with great white sharks,' he said.

The video was posted on Facebook by South West Rocks Dive Centre and has received more than 33,000 views and almost 600 shares.

A caption along the video said: 'What a day 23 degree water 30 meter visibility and at least 100 Hammerheads Christmas is here early.'
