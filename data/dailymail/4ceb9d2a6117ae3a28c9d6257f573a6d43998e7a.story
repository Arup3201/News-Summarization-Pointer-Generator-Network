Lurking in the shadows, this is the vile thug who scrawled the word ‘Islam’ on the Bomber Command war memorial in London.

The balaclava-clad vandal was caught on camera desecrating the monument to the 55,573 RAF crew who lost their lives during the Second World War.

CCTV footage shows the suspect spraying the Green Park monument with red paint at 3.20am on Monday.

Suspect: A CCTV camera picked up this man as he approached the Bomber Command memorial on Monday

Gotcha: The vandal, who covered his face with a balaclava (right), snuck in and out of the shadows to spray (left)

Fled: The attack took around ten minutes before he walked calmly away along Piccadilly towards Knightsbridge in Central London

During the desecration, the vandal hides in the shadows when cars pass before continuing to spray the memorial.

The vandal wrote the word ‘Islam’ in 2ft-high letters and also sprayed over an inscription.

Similar graffiti was sprayed on the 
Animals in War memorial, in nearby Park Lane. The £7million Bomber 
Command monument was opened by the Queen in June last year.

Gerry Abrahams, 90, of Margate in 
Kent, who flew more than 31 bombing missions, said: ‘If anyone knows who
 this man is, please tell the police.

Suspicious: Another CCTV camera appears to capture the moment before the war memorial was vandalised

Attack: The Bomber Command Memorial in Green Park, London, was sprayed and then covered up by police

Message: This image shows the word 'Islam' daubed on the Animals In War Memorial, but police are not sure if it was carried out by Muslim protesters or far-right groups trying to stir up trouble

‘He should be brought to justice. I am shocked and appalled by this vandalism.’ 

Harry Irons, 89, of Romford in Essex, who survived 80 missions as a rear gunner, said: ‘I want people to look at these pictures and help catch the perpetrator. 

‘It is appalling to treat the memorial  like this.’ 

Jim Dooley, head of fundraising for the Bomber Command monument, said: ‘This is heartbreaking for the veterans. I just hope police can find this thug.’

Police are yet to make any arrests over the vandalism, which was partially cleaned by workmen earlier this week.

The clean-up begins: A contractor removes Islam graffiti which was daubed on a memorials to members of RAF Bomber Command after a spate of ugly attacks in the wake of soldier Lee Rigby's murder

Making good: At the Bomber Command monument, two contractors worked for over an hour removing the metre-high bright red letters spelling 'Islam'

Disgraceful: A council worker removes the word 'Islam' from the Animals In War memorial in London's Park Lane after it was attacked by vandals

No respect: The vandals also sprayed paint over a poignant message giving details about the monument

There are concerns the repairs could cost tens of thousands because the paint has soaked into the stone.

A spokesman for the RAF Benevolent 
Fund, which is responsible for the memorial’s maintenance, said: ‘The 
paint has seeped in to such a depth that the use of solvents is unlikely
 to bring the memorial back to how it should be.

‘The worst-case scenario is taking the damaged stone out and replacing it with fresh stone, which will be very expensive.’

The two monuments were targeted as 
police forces across the country dealt with a spate of ugly attacks 
after the killing of soldier Lee Rigby.

The grandparents of murdered soldier Lee Rigby today laid a floral wreath at the makeshift shrine to the brave soldier.

The couple stopped at the scene of the slaying to lay a blue pillow-shaped wreath adorned with flowers and a blue ribbon with the words ‘grandson’ and Drummer Rigby’s service number ‘2B – RRF’

An inscription read: ‘To our brave grandson Lee Rigby – taken from us too soon. We will miss you terribly. Rest in peace. Nanny and Grandad from Southend on Sea.'

The grieving couple held hands as they spent two hours reading tributes laid at the shrine.

While reading one – a poem entitled the Woolwich Soldier – Drummer Rigby’s grandmother appeared to wipe a tear from her eye.

Her husband, who did not want to give his name, said: ‘We came down here to see the flowers and read the messages people left for Lee. We really appreciate it.

‘We are too upset to say more at this moment. Sorry.’

Tribute: The pair read a selection of the vast array of messages of condolence left at the site

The number of people leaving floral tributes was so vast that nearby flower shops reportedly ran out of blooms

The poem, The Woolwich Soldier, read:

Just out for a walk on an early stack, not looking for trouble, not watching my back.

Mothers with prams holding hands with their kids, not paying attention to the car as it skids.

Caught completely off guard not expecting what comes, one man with a knife another with guns.

No chance of defence, no chance to fight back, looking for help as the cowards attack.

An angel arrives as the light turns to grey, a woman attempts to steer attackers away.

My last thought of 'Thank You' never strays from my brain, as my body shuts down I feel no more pain.

I look to the left and I look to the right, thousands of squaddies are all that’s in sight.

Uniforms are crisp and their faces are clean, no anger or hate to be seen.

As if by command they all salute as one, the RSM smiles, says 'welcome home, son'.

Lieutenant Colonel Bob Christopher Royal Artillery, the Commander of Woolwich Station where Drummer Rigby served, today released a statement saying he was killed doing a job he loved.

It said: 'Drummer Lee Rigby was in London reaching out to young men and women who want to serve their country by joining the Armed Forces. This was a job he loved doing, and he was very good at it. He was tragically killed while travelling home from that job and our thoughts are with his family, loved ones, friends and colleagues.

'Drummer Rigby was proud to live and work in this community, as are all the soldiers who are based here. The best tribute we can pay him is to not allow this awful crime to separate the military family in Woolwich from the fantastic support we have received, are currently receiving and know that we will continue to receive from our friends and neighbours across the borough.

'I would like to take this opportunity to thank the police for their sterling work as well as the local people and their community leaders who represent the wide range of religious and ethnic backgrounds which make up and enrich this borough.

'I have had the privilege of hosting a number of Drummer Rigby’s family, loved ones and friends over the past few days and I know they, like us, Drummer Rigby’s Army family, have been touched and take strength from the large number of people, including many from this fine borough, that have taken the trouble to come and leave tributes and pay their respects on such an amazing scale as is clearly visible in the road leading to the barracks which Drummer Rigby called home.'
