Spurs still so far from the top four

It was the same old story for Tottenham at Man City. They have now conceded 26 goals in their last seven games against the champions. They want to get back in the top four but at the moment they could not be further from it.

They have struggled ever since they sold Gareth Bale and most of the men they brought in have not been good enough. Arsenal got a lot of stick for not signing players but they have spent the best part of £100million on Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez, Danny Welbeck and Mathieu Debuchy.

Alexis Sanchez, who joined Arsenal from Barcelona for £30m, opened the scoring against the Tigers

Those are ambitious signings of proven quality. Spurs have spent plenty of money but how many of those transfers were for top-class players?

Erik Lamela has not lived up to his billing and clearly Roberto Soldado is not the answer up front. They still look short at centre half, too. Younes Kaboul gave away a penalty at City — exactly what you don’t want your captain to do — and the rest just could not cope with Sergio Aguero.

Tottenham have paid a lot of money for an awful lot of players. I just hope they kept the receipt.

It's a shootout for the title

That was some performance by Sergio Aguero.

He was absolutely magnificent against Tottenham and with Manchester City and Chelsea the two favourites for the title, it could come down to a shootout between Aguero and Diego Costa. 

Watching both of them play at Atletico Madrid, I always felt they could score goals in the Premier League. 

They have started this season in electric form with nine goals each. 

The only problem is they are prone to muscle injuries. 

With both sides looking good, it could come down to which striker stays fit enough to fire his team to the title.

Saints march on

At the start of the season there was a lot of worry around Southampton. People were questioning if they could survive relegation, let alone perform to the same levels as last season.

I always thought they would be fine but they have been so good I have had to write about them almost every week!

They were brilliant against Sunderland, even though Gus Poyet’s side were absolutely woeful. They have a good squad and with Dusan Tadic supplying Graziano Pelle, they always look like scoring.

I loved that even after scoring so many goals Ronald Koeman still wanted more. He was urging his team to get forward and it was the perfect all-round performance.

Super Sakho

You can’t help but be impressed by West Ham’s firepower at the moment.

Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho have come in and immediately been banging in the goals. At £12million you would expect Valencia to produce the goods but Sakho has been a revelation.

Last season he was scoring goals for Metz in the French second division but his pace and power make him the perfect fit for the Premier League. He cost just £3.5million and is the kind of player every manager dreams of discovering. Credit to Sam Allardyce and co-chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold because with six goals in his last six games, Sakho looks worth his weight in gold.

A Sterling show from Raheem

Nobody came out of the row over Raheem Sterling with any credit. Thankfully on Sunday he gave us a reminder of just why we should all really be talking about him.

I was at Loftus Road and Sterling put in a wonderful display. He had energy, was zipping past people and at times looked like he could run through a puddle without making a splash.

He is a special player and the last thing we want is for him to start feeling that playing for England is a chore when it’s a privilege.

Any future issues have to be kept in house because he is a prized asset to be nurtured, not criticised.

Only two teams in the top seven tiers of English football are still undefeated this season - Chelsea and Bristol City.

More brilliance from Bristol

What a job Steve Cotterill is doing at Bristol City. He has an intense way of working but it’s obviously doing the trick.

A win against Coventry means they already have a five-point lead at the top of League One and remain unbeaten.

Bristol is something of a sleeping giant as a football city, but Cotterill is doing his best to wake them up.

Bright futures

On Saturday I went with a friend of mine to watch his lad play for Chelsea’s Under 7s team. It was so good to see so many young kids with lovely skill and technique.

One boy in particular really looked the part. He stepped up and took two corners — one with his left foot and one with his right. He was so comfortable with both feet and it was a real pleasure to see that in a young kid.

People often complain that we don’t produce technically gifted youngsters in this country but there’s no reason why we can’t. Watching those kids on Saturday, it was reassuring to know that they were being developed in just the right way.

10 - Despite their 4-1 drubbing, Spurs showed good attacking intent against Man City. Mauricio Pochettino’s side had 10 shots at goal in the first half at the Etihad, including blocked shots. That’s the most by any team against Man City so far this season and no team had more than 10 in the whole of last season - Southampton matched that total in December 2013.

8 - Since the start of last season, Everton’s Seamus Coleman  has scored eight league goals, more than any other defender in the same time frame.

4 - Mohamed Diame has now scored four goals in five Premier League games. That’s the same as his total last year and he has never scored more than four in a PL season. 

700th - West Ham's 3-1 win at Burnley was their 700th game in the Premier League. They are only the ninth team to reach that total after Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester United and Newcastle.

1st - Liverpool's 3-2 win at Loftus Road was the first time in their Premier League history that they have benefited from two own goals in the same game. Centre halves Richard Dunne and Steven Caulker were the unlucky pair for QPR.

1982 - Sunderland's 8-0 hammering at Southampton was their heaviest league defeat since an 8-0 loss to Watford in September 1982. 

2012 - Gabriel Obertan scored his first league goal for Newcastle since February 2012, when he scored in a 2-0 win at Blackburn. It ended a run of 24 games without a goal.
