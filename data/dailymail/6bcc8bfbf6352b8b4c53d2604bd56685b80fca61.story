Planning Minister Nick Boles is locked in a furious row with the head of the National Trust - after accusing him of selfishly campaigning against new housing while owning ‘at least’ two homes himself.

In a highly personal clash on BBC Two’s Newsnight programme, Mr Boles repeatedly challenged Sir Simon Jenkins to say how many properties he owns.

It comes as the government stepped up its rhetoric on the need to accelerate housebuilding on green fields.

Sir Simon, chairman of the National Trust, ducked the question and angrily pointed out that he was helping to contribute towards the cost of Mr Boles’s taxpayer-funded second home in Lincolnshire.

‘Simon, how many houses do you own?’ Mr Boles demanded.

‘I’m paying for your houses, bloody hell,’ Sir Simon responded.

During a heated debate Sir Simon accused the minister of adopting a policy of ‘let’s let rip and let money determine it - let’s bribe anyone we can to build houses’. He added: ‘That’s not the way to do planning.’

Sir Simon said there were already enough sites to build two million new homes ‘right now’.

He went on: ‘Selling planning permissions through bribes is just not the way to plan in this country. We should plan appropriate development, protecting the beautiful places which are fast disappearing.’ He suggested ministers should focus on building flats in towns rather than developing a ‘a few homes in meadows’.

The two men clashed over the need to build more homes on greenfield sites as ministers warned grandparents not to oppose housebuilding for their children and grandchildren

Mr Boles hit back: ‘I have two homes - one I own with a huge mortgage, and one the taxpayer thankfully rents for me in my constituency. Simon, I know, has at least two homes because I have been to two of them.

‘Those of us who have two homes or more need to be very careful about telling people to go and live in a top floor flat when they are trying to bring up two kids and want a house with a garden.’ Mr Boles, whose father Sir Jack Boles is a former director-general of the National Trust, defended his comments yesterday, saying Sir Simon was ‘profoundly wrong’ about the need for new housing on green field sites.

He declined to say which side of the argument his father was on, saying; ‘He’s entitled to his own opinions.’ He declined to say which side of the argument his father was on, saying; ‘He’s entitled to his own opinions.’

The row cam ahead of a major speech by Mr Boles today when he dramatically raised 
the stakes over the housing crisis, saying the Government has a ‘moral’ 
duty to force councils to find land for development to defend Margaret 
Thatcher’s dream of a ‘property owning democracy’.

And he has warned grandparents who oppose new housebuilding risk 'propping up their kids and their grandkids' who cannot afford to buy their home own.

He has unveiled plans to bribe local communities with hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash to accept new house building.

In
 future, neighbourhood groups who back plans for estates will be handed 
money to build community centres, save a pub or re-roof the local 
church.

Mr Boles will also deliver a threat to town hall chiefs, warning those who refuse to find land to build on will be overruled.

Ministers have given council bosses until March to come up with land to build 270,000 homes for each of the next five years.
