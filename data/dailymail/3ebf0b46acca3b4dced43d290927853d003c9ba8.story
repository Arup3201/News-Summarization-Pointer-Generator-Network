A former volunteer firefighter will spend up to two years behind bars for deliberately starting fifteen fires.

Alex Gordon Nobel, 22, appeared in a Newcastle Local Court on Wednesday. 

During the sentencing, the magistrate said he was fascinated by fire, and referenced a psychiatrist's report that found he fitted the description of a pyromaniac.

Newcastle Herald has reported that Noble started the fires to gain experience in putting them out, and aspired to become a professional firefighter.

After lighting the fires, Noble would alert authorities to their whereabouts, then arrive himself to help put them out.

But he was caught after police grew suspicious over the speeds he was appearing to the flames.

In 2012, Noble lit the first fire on his way home from a dinner one night at Dyalson RSL club, along along Gorokan Road, in Wyee. Two weeks later he struck at Dyce Road, Wyee.

The frequency and severity of his arson attacks quickly grew.

In October 2013, Noble was responsible for a blaze that ripped through the Catherine Hill Bay area, north of Sydney.

The blaze burned for weeks before winds pushed it through the beachside town. It later destroyed the iconic Wallarah House and the Jetty Master's Cottage,  threatening hundreds of lives. 

Newcastle Herald reported that at Nobel's sentencing, the defence council member Mandy Hull said he had 'expressed genuine sorrow and remorse for his actions and was disappointed with himself for letting the Rural Fire Service down.'

She added that 'the majority of the fires were lit in low-density areas and during the colder months, and were reported to authorities by Noble himself'.

 Noble was sentenced to two years jail, with a minimum non-parole period of 14 months. The magistrate said the legislation for intentionally starting fires allows for a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison

But magistrate Ian Cheetham said his actions destroyed large swathes of land and risked hundreds of lives.

To demonstrate the severity of the crimes, Cheetham said the legislation for intentionally starting fires allows for a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.

A psychiatrists report which found Noble was fanatical about fires and fitted the description of a pyromaniac was also adressed by Cheetham.

He is yet to face the district court on further charges in February 2015.
