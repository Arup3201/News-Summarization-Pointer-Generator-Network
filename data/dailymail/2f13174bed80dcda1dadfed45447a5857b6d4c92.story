A bid to win favour at a  strip club went disastrously wrong for a man who claimed he was Spike Lee's son - when staff realised the boy in question is only 17.

Despite wielding a fabled American Express black card, the mystery partier was reportedly thrown out of the New York venue as soon as curious bouncers looked up the teenager on Google.

According to the report in the New York Post, the spurned clubber shouted: 'I’m not going to be arrested. No one’s going to arrest me!', before racing to a waiting car.

Bold: A man reportedly claimed he was Jackson Lee (right), the son of Hollywood director Spike (left), to get into a strip club - but he was busted when staff looked Jackson up on Google and realised he is only 17

Hollywood legend Spike Lee, 57, whose directing credits include Malcolm X (1992) and He Got Game (1998), has two children with his wife of more than 20 years Tonya Lewis Lee.

His daughter Satchel was born in 1994 while his son Jackson was born in 1997, putting both well under the legal drinking age of 21.

A source told the newspaper the party-goer dropped Jackson's name when he arrived at Larry Flynt's Hustler Club in the early hours last week, and showed an ID which said he was 22 years old.

Then, the report claimed, he placed the $60 entry fee on an American Express Centurion card, better known as the invitation-only 'black card' whose users earn an average of $1.3million.

Its users must spend at least $250,000 a year - and even then it'll cost them an annual fee of $2,500 along with a $7,500 initiation fee.

But Jackson's mother told the Post the man at the club was not her son, adding any suggestion that he was would be a 'bald-faced lie'.

It would not be the first time a fake celebrity has caused a stir in New York City.

Two years ago 21-year-old student Brett Cohen hired fake bodyguards, paparazzi and an entourage to follow him around the streets of Manhattan in a bid to fool people into thinking he was famous.

It worked - and he caused a crush of 300 people while posing for photographs with groups of giggling girls.

He later said it was a 'social experiment,' which showed 'how our culture is so obsessed with celebrity and fame'.

Widely hailed as one of the greatest storytellers of his generation, Spike Lee has devoted his film career to tales of urban poverty, inequality and race relations.

He has twice been nominated for an Oscar, the first for Do the Right Thing (1989) and the second for 4 Little Girls (1997).
