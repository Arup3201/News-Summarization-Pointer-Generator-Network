Kell Brook's trainer believes the world welterweight champion could have died in the knife assault he suffered in Tenerife last week.

Brook claimed he was the victim of an ‘unprovoked attack’ when a man he had been drinking with stabbed him in his left leg while on holiday. 

His trainer, Dominic Ingle, said: ‘If the hospital hadn’t got their hands on him when they did - he had lost that much blood - he could have been on his way out.’

Brook, who flew back to England on Monday, will wear a cast for four to six weeks. He is out of his scheduled IBF title defence on December 6, but is hopeful of returning early in February or March.

Ingle added: ‘Kell is very sociable, a great lad, but maybe, considering other things that have happened before, a bit naive in who he is with.’

Spanish police have not yet caught Brook's attacker.
