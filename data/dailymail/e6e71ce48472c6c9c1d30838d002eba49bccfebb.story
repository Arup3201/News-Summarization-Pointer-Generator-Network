Johan Cruyff has attacked both David Moyes and Louis van Gaal, claiming the current Manchester United boss needs to organise his side better and the former never should have been appointed.

The Dutch legend's relationship with Van Gaal has always been strained, and he didn't hold back when talking about the United manager's current problems.

'They need to be organised because they were totally disorganised and normally Van Gaal is a very good organiser to put things his way,' he told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme.

Former Ajax and Barcelona manager Johan Cruyff  claimed Louis van Gaal needs to organise his side better

'That's creating the basis. From then on you have got to build.

'(United's turnaround) depends how quickly the other players adjust themselves.'

The former Barcelona boss also believes the United hierarchy made a mistake in appointing Moyes last summer after 11 years spent in charge of Everton.

Cruyff said that while Van Gaal's strength is normally his organisation, his current team is in disarray

Cruyff and Van Gaal's relationship has always been strained, the cause of which is the subject of debate

'Moyes is a very good coach because I've seen many many years in Everton but he's not a coach which should fit with Manchester United because the focus for both teams are totally different.

'That's why the biggest mistake is to ask Moyes to come to Manchester United because it's a totally different team, a totally different mentality.

'The basic mistake was to sign him on. I think he is a great manager but not for Manchester United. He's just a great manager for another type of team.'

Cruyff said that David Moyes never should have been appointed as Manchester United manager

The Dutch legend said that, while he respected Moyes, the Glaswegian was better at 'another type of team'
