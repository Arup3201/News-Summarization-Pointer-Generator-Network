It was once a colourful backdrop for the shenanigans of Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy, but years of neglect meant this piece of film history risked being lost forever.

The Gilmore  Gasoline Filling Station has now been restored to its former glory - but people wanting to refuel here will have to be content with a skinny cappuccino.

Coffee giant Starbucks bought the garage in Los Angeles last year and have now finished its transformation into a drive through coffee shop.

The Gilmore Gas Station was a backdrop for  was listed as a Los Angeles cultural monument in 1992, but was soon after left to vandals and graffiti artists

Starbucks worked with a historical consultant to ensure the character of the building was preserved during the renovation

Opened in 1935 by Gilmore Oil, which was then the largest independent oil company on the West Coast, the art deco building served the drivers of Hollywood until it was abandoned in the 1990s.

It became a filming location soon after with wacky weatherman Harris K. Telemacher (Steve Martin) stopping to fill up with lover Sara McDowel (Victoria Tennant) prior to attending a fundraising event. 

He asked for the 'full-service' treatment, which includes a tank of petrol, a car wash, and removal and exchange of all four tires. 

The petrol station was also where Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) informed Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) of the location of the stolen money in the 1982 comedy 48 Hours.

It was listed as a Los Angeles cultural monument in 1992, but was soon after left to vandals and graffiti artists. 

Starbucks store design manager Jonathan Alpert said despite its poor state he saw the potential of the petrol station from the start.

The new store, which has a drive through, serving hatch and outdoor seating area, retains the main existing structure as well as the canopy from an added car wash

He said: "At the very beginning we knew this was something special.

'The building was in such a dilapidated state, but we could see it had potential.

'We wanted to restore the building in a way that allows us to serve the community while celebrating its history.'

Mr Alpert and his team worked with a historical consultant to ensure the character of the building was preserved during the renovation.

The new store, which has a drive through, serving hatch and outdoor seating area, retains the main existing structure as well as the canopy from an added car wash. They preserved and restored existing glass and metal elements wherever possible.

The team added energy-efficient LED rope lights to replicate the old tubes of neon lighting. 

Non-historic contemporary service bay roll-up doors were replaced with aluminum frame garage doors in the style of the period to form an exterior wall.

Mr Alpert added: 'We didn't try to over-brand the building; we tried to keep it true to the original with only limited signage.

'We have reinvigorated the corner of this community and its art deco past, now it's electric!'
