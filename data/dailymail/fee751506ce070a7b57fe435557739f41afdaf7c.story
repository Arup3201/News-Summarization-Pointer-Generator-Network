Three members of the same family have been killed in a four-vehicle crash involving a lorry.

Warwickshire Police said a woman and two men travelling in the same car died in the collision near Tamworth at about 5.10pm yesterday.

They have now been named as school technician Maggie Stewart, her son Damien Stewart,16, and his cousin Dion Walker-Smith, 15. They had been driving to a birthday party. 

Killed: Maggie Stewart, her son Damien Stewart,16, and his cousin Dion Walker-Smith, 15

A Scania lorry, a Hyundai Getz, a Peugeot 207 and a Mercedes car were involved in the accident, which happened near a garden centre in Trinity Road, Freasley.

All the three occupants of the Hyundai were pronounced dead at the scene, and the male driver of one of the other cars was taken to the Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield.

Ms Stewart, who would have been 43 today, worked at Kingsbury High School in Tamworth where her son and his cousin were Year 11 prefects.

Friends and family held a candlelit vigil outside the school and the local paper, the Birmingham Mail, says the school released a statement saying: 'Thank you to everyone who attended to reflect on the passing of three of our own.

'The large turn-out demonstrated how well respected and loved Dion, Damien and Maggie were.  

'In order that we continue to respect their memory the school gates will be open throughout the day on Sunday in order that tributes, should people wish to leave them, can be laid in front of reception.

'These will be moved on Monday morning to the memorial garden for pupils to continue to pay their respects.

'We will continue to work throughout the weekend to secure the support of the emergency planning team from Warwickshire.

'It is our hope that grief councillors will be in school Monday to support our youngsters as they seek to come to terms with this loss.'

Friends of the two boys, who played for Coton Green FC under 16s, also paid their respects on Twitter.

Ellie-May Burley said: 'Rest in peace; Dion Walker-Smith, Damien Stewart and Maggie Stewart'

Dan Farr added: 'RIP to the two lads from Coton Green, who we was suppose to be playing tomorrow thoughts go out to there family's and team mates #RIP'

A Facebook page set up in tribute to Damian and Dion, has so far attracted tributes from more than 200 people.

One of those who posted a message on the page, Chloe Harrison, wrote: 'You were all imprinted in our life somehow, your loud singing in form or biology, never failing to make us all laugh.

'You were the life of our year, the ones with the biggest personalities and massive smiles.'

Another friend, Luke Jay, posted: 'Heaven have gained two new angels, such a cracking pair of lads, always smiling and a great pair of footballers.

'So many good memories as kids, I feel privileged to have known them both.'

A police spokesman said: 'Roads around the area were closed to allow officers to conduct their investigation and for the vehicles to be removed from the scene.

'Officers investigating the incident would like to hear from anyone who witnessed it or saw any of the vehicles and the manner in which they were being driven before the collision occurred.'

Anyone with information is asked to contact Warwickshire Police on 101.
