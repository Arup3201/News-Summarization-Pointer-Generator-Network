The most distant galaxy ever seen in the universe has been discovered by astronomers.

It’s so far away that its light, initially captured by Hubble, has taken 13.1 billion years to reach Earth.

It's remote distance means that scientists are observing it at a time when the universe was in its infancy.

The galaxy is thought to be 30 billion light years from Earth but we can only see it as it was 13.1 billion years ago because of the way the universe is expanding.

A new spectroscope - an optical device for producing and observing a spectrum of light or radiation - on the Keck 1 space telescope in Hawaii confirmed its distance by measuring its ‘redshift’ or wavelength.

Although some more distant candidate galaxies have been detected their existence has not yet been fully established in this decisive way.

The galaxy has a redshift of 7.51 meaning it was born only 700 million years after the Big Bang.

Few galaxies with redshifts greater than seven have had their distances confirmed spectroscopically.

Its red, ultraviolet light colour implies it’s rich in metal and churns out stars over a hundred times quicker than the Milky Way.

Professor Bahram Mobasher, of California University in Riverside, said: ‘What makes this galaxy unique - compared to other such discoveries - is the spectroscopic confirmation of its distance.’

Light travels at about 186,000 miles per second so when we look at distant objects we see them as they appeared in the past.

The more distant we push these observations the farther into the past we can see.

Professor Mobasher said: ‘By observing a galaxy that far back in time we can study the earliest formation of galaxies.

‘By comparing properties of galaxies at different distances we can explore the evolution of galaxies throughout the age of the universe.’

The researchers’ observations, described in Nature, show the galaxy named z8-GND-5296 is forming about 330 stars each year.

By comparison the Milky Way forms only two to three stars per year.

The new distance record-holder lies in the same part of the sky as the previous record-holder at a redshift of 7 - which also happens to have a very high rate of star-formation.

Project leader Dr Steven Finkelstein, of Texas University in Austin, said: ‘There are way more regions of very high star formation than we previously thought.

‘There must be a decent number of them if we happen to find two in the same area of the sky.’

Professor Mobasher said the detection of ever more remote galaxies are on the horizon with the construction of the powerful Thirty Metre Telescope in Hawaii and the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile along with the 6.5 metre James Webb Space Telescope in space.

He said: ‘By the end of this decade we should expect to find many more such galaxies at even larger distances allowing us to witness the process of galaxy formation as it happens.’

This compares to two or three stars that the Milky Way produces annually

Galaxy's light began journey to Earth 700 million years after the Big Bang

By 2020, we are expected to find more such galaxies at larger distances

This will allow us to witness the process of galaxy formation as it happens
