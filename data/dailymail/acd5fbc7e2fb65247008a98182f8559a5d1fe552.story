Hull City's need for a striker is intensifying after the news that Nikica Jelavic and Abel Hernandez could both be out for six weeks through injury.

Steve Bruce has asked about finance for Jermain Defoe and is keen on Sunderland's Steven Fletcher. He has also made enquiries for Callum McManaman at Wigan.

Hull striker Yannick Sagbo has also admitted that he is interested in a return to Ligue 1 this month. 

Nikica Jelavic limps off in Saturday's 1-0 defeat against West Brom and faces a lengthy lay-off 

Abel Hernandez also faces a spell on the sidelines. It could be six weeks until he returns to first-team action 

Talking to France Football, the 26-year-old said: 'Bordeaux, that could interest me. Like all Ligue 1 teams. 

'I have not spoken to anyone from Bordeaux on the phone. I leave that to my agent. He will inform me when there are concrete offers. 

'In any case, Ligue 1 is a league that I know well and I would look very favourably on the idea of a return. My daughter is also in Paris. These are things that I must think about.'

Yannick Sagbo, in action against Arsenal, has revealed that he is interested in a Ligue 1 return
