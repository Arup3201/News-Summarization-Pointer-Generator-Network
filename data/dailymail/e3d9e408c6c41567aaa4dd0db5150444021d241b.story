Less than one in 10 female soldiers want a combat job, a survey of the 170,000 women serving in the U.S. Army has revealed - and for those who want to serve in battle, the vast majority agree that physical standards must not be lowered to accommodate women.

With roughly one in five Army 
positions considered combat-related, commanders are turning to science 
to find a unisex standard to judge which soldiers physically have the 
right stuff to fight wars.

Testing
 at Fort Stewart and other U.S. bases is breaking away from the Army's 
longtime standards for physical fitness — pushups, sit-ups and two-mile 
runs — to focus instead on battlefield tasks, such as dragging a wounded
 comrade to safety or installing and removing the heavy barrel of the 25
 mm gun mounted on Bradley vehicles.

Only eight per cent of army women who responded to the survey said they wanted to fight on the battlefield.

Of
 those, an overwhelming number said they'd like to be a Night Stalker – a
 member of the elite special operations helicopter crews who perhaps are
 best known for flying the Navy Seals into Osama bin Laden’s compound in
 2011.

Last year, the Pentagon ordered that women must have the same opportunities to serve in combat jobs as men, with thousands of positions slated to open to both genders in 2016.

Researchers also found that soldiers 
of both genders are nervous about women entering combat jobs, but say 
they are determined to do it fairly.

The
 study showed men are worried about losing their jobs to women and women
 are worried they will be seen as getting jobs because of their gender 
and not their qualifications.

David Brinkley, deputy chief of staff 
for operations at the Army's Training and Doctrine Command at Fort 
Eustis in Virginia, said some people think the Army is coming up with 
unrealistic requirements while others believe standards will be lower to
 let women fight on the front lines.

'We intend to do neither. That's why we based this on the actual thing you have to do,' he said.

At
 Fort Stewart in Georgia, a volunteer group of soldiers - 100 men and 60
 women - are spending a month drilling on the most physically 
challenging tasks demanded of infantrymen, cavalry scouts, mortar 
launchers and tank crews.

In
 March, scientists from the Army's Research Institute for Environmental 
Medicine will have the troops perform those tasks while wearing heart 
rate monitors, masks that monitor oxygen intake and other equipment to 
study the effects of their physical exertion.

One
 of the volunteers, Spc Artrice Scott, said she has no intention of 
trading in her job as an Army cook to join an infantry platoon or an 
armor unit. But she sees the testing as a great opportunity to lead the 
way for women in the U.S. military.

'The
 heaviest thing we lift in the kitchen is boxes of frozen chicken, 45 
pounds,' said Scott, 29, of Mobile, Alabama. 'And you don't have to lift
 those over your head.'

During
 a training session Tuesday, Scott shaved 45 seconds off her previous 
best time carrying two anti-tank missiles into a Bradley armored vehicle
 and loading them into the turret.

Army
 commanders say there are no doubts that women have the mental and 
technical abilities needed. Only their ability to perform the most 
arduous physical tasks has been questioned.

The
 survey released yesterday found there were nagging stereotypes. Male 
soldiers fretted that their unit's readiness will be degraded because of
 what they term 'women issues,' such as pregnancy and menstrual cycles. 
Or they worried that women incapable of the physical demands would be 
brought in anyway.

However, 
the survey also showed that only about eight per cent of Army women said
 they wanted combat jobs. Brinkley said such limited interest also is in
 line with what other countries, such as Norway, have seen as they 
integrated women into combat roles.

Major General
 Mike Murray, commanding general at Fort Stewart, watched Tuesday as 
coed groups of soldiers set up heavy 120mm mortars on a practice field.

An
 officer with 32 years of infantry experience, Murray said it's time to 
open combat jobs to women and 'this is going to get studied to death' in
 order for the Army to prove to naysayers that women soldiers are 
physically capable.

The 
volunteer group at Fort Stewart includes a mix of combat veterans and 
newcomers, but it didn't take long for the group to gel after some 
initial awkwardness.

'It was
 almost like a high school dance where you had the guys over here and 
the girls over there,' Murray said. 'A week later, it was amazing how 
fast teams form.'

Giving 
soldiers a month to prepare meant women who have never been trained to 
scale a six-foot wall or pull a casualty from a tank have had time to 
learn the proper techniques before they are tested for real next month.

Staff Sergeant
 Terry Kemp, a cavalry scout who has helping train the Fort Stewart 
volunteers, said female soldiers started to catch up with their male 
counterparts after two weeks of training.

Missile
 toting drills that initially took the men seven minutes were taking 
women 12 minutes to complete, he said. But by week three, men and women 
had trimmed their times to about four minutes.

Those
 who still insist women can't perform as well as men in combat 'can beat
 their chests about it all day,' said Kemp, a veteran of Iraq and 
Afghanistan. 'But eventually it's going to happen.'

Exactly what sort of fitness tests or standards will come out of the Army's study remains to be seen.

There
 are no current fitness requirements for serving in combat positions 
beyond the Army's standard physical fitness test for all soldiers — 
which includes pushups, situps and a 2-mile run and grades men and women
 on different scales.

Brinkley
 said the Army took a lesson from fire departments by not focusing on 
soldier's ability to perform pushups or pullups, which favor men because
 they test upper body strength.

He
 said officials realize women do physical tasks differently, using more 
core strength and legs. By focusing on tasks rather than exercises, Army
 officials hope to eliminate gender bias from their study.

Taking
 a break from toting anti-tank missiles at Fort Stewart, Arvizu said she
 found the heavy lifting to be humbling. And though she felt encouraged 
by her male colleagues, she had no desire to give up driving a truck and
 join a combat unit.

'It's not that I came, I saw and conquered,' she said. 'But I came, I saw and I did my best.'
