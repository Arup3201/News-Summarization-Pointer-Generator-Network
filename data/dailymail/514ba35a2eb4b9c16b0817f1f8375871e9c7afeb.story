This is the horrific moment a Chinese police office was killed after being struck from behind with a garden hoe.

The police officer, named locally as Duan Jin Yin, was among a group of officers involved in a dispute with construction workers.

The officers had told the men to stop their work as the building had not been inspected by planning officials, according to local reports.
