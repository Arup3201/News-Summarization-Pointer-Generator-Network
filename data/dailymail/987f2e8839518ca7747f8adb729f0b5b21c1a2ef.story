Controversial: Justice campaigners have called for an investigation after sex assault charges were dismissed against Matthew Barnett (above) due to lack of evidence

A county prosecutor and sheriff have been accused of a cover-up after sex attack charges were dropped against the grandson of an influential Missouri representative.

Matthew Barnett, 17, had been facing charges of sexually assaulting a drunk 14-year-old girl at his family home in January.

But the case sparked outrage among justice campaigners when the accusations were dismissed earlier this month due to lack of evidence.

An online petition claims the decision was made despite video evidence and even before forensic test results had come back from the lab.

It alleges the teenager's grandfather, GOP state representative Rex Barnett, may have influenced Sheriff Darren White and prosecutor Robert Rice.

It states that Rex Barnett serves on at least one committee with Sheriff White and has called on Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster to investigate.

'The conduct of Robert Rice and Darren White is, at the very least, questionable in this case,' the petition goes on to say.

Barnett had been accused of sexually assaulting the girl while his friend Jordan Zech, 17, recorded the alleged attack on his cell phone.

It is also alleged a 15-year-old boy was filmed assaulting a 13-year-old girl at the same time in the house.

Court documents state Barnett left the girl passed out on her front lawn, where she was found by her parents, according to St Joseph News-Press. She says she cannot remember the alleged attack.

Barnett and Zech faced sex charges after the incident on January 8, but these were dropped on March 13 because prosecutors said they could not prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

Barnett instead faces a misdemeanor charge of endangering the welfare of a child over claims the girl was given alcohol and then dumped outside. No charges remain against Zech.

Mr Rice said it was the 'right call' to drop the charges.

'The state does not have proof beyond a reasonable doubt that those two defendants committed the charges that were originally filed against them after concluding our investigation,' he is reported as saying.'

He added: 'We did have all the medical, and all the information where we could make a decision based on the evidence, and I am absolutely convinced it was the right call to do, and it was the right decision to dismiss it.'

'Questionable conduct': The petition on change.org which calls on Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster to investigate the case

Campaigners have expressed their shock over the decision, which they claim was made before the forensic test results had been been returned.

They also point to the fact there is video evidence and claim the 15-year-old confessed to his part in the attacks while facing charges in the juvenile courts.

The petition posted on change.org, a website which allows people to campaign for social change, says: 'The rape kits (forensic tests) performed on both the girls haven't even come back yet for investigators to see.

'Matthew Barnett is also in a very influential family in Maryville. His grandfather is Missouri representative Rex Barnett, and Rex serves on at least one committee with Sheriff Darrin White.

'The conduct of Robert Rice and Darrin White is at, the very least, questionable in this case.

'Please sign our petition, give these girls and their families some relief, justice, and closure.'

It has been signed by 848 people.
