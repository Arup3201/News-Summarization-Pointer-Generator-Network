THE FINAL SEASON by Nigel McCrery (Random House £14.99)

Most of us are familiar with one football-related story from World War I — that during the so-called Christmas truce of 1914, British and German troops played each other along the Western Front.

Football was the ‘common denominator that drew the two sides together for a few hours of peace and humanity amid the horrors of war’, writes Nigel McCrery in this fascinating book.

He provides evidence that British Tommies lost one game 3‑2: ‘We can assume the Germans won on penalties,’ he adds, wryly.

Celtic's William Angus showed true courage by saving a comrade's life

Already, by Christmas Day, 1914, Britain’s dead included some of the nation’s most feted footballers. In telling their stories, and those of the other players who perished, McCrery offers a new perspective on the conflict itself.

There is Leigh Richmond Roose, the Welsh international once known as ‘the Prince of Goalkeepers’, an incorrigible entertainer who would sit on the crossbar at half-time, bantering with the crowd. He was also famously handsome — the Daily Mail called him ‘London’s most eligible bachelor’ — and was ‘close’ to the music hall star Marie Lloyd.

Roose, who studied medicine at King’s College London, went with the Royal Army Medical Corps to Gallipoli. For many years, it was assumed, even by his family, that he died there.

But he didn’t. He joined the 9th Royal Fusiliers as a humble private, evidently because he wanted to fight even more than he wanted to treat the wounded.

He died the following summer on the Somme, but not before showing great heroism, and more than a little evidence of his goalkeeping skills, in resisting an attack by German troops armed with flame-throwers.

According to the regimental history, Roose, though choking and burnt, ‘continued to throw bombs until his arm gave out’.

Not all of these heroic former footballers died. McCrery tells the remarkable story of Corporal Willie Angus, the former Celtic player. In June 1915, he volunteered to crawl out, under constant fire and at the cost of his left eye and right foot, almost to the German lines to retrieve a badly-wounded officer, Lieutenant James Martin.

Two months later, King George V presented him with the Victoria Cross. Even more thrillingly, perhaps, he received standing ovations from huge crowds at Celtic Park and Ibrox, home of Celtic’s bitter rivals Glasgow Rangers — on the very same day.

Angus and Martin remained great friends for their rest of their lives. Martin died in 1956, Angus three years later.

Another who survived the war, but not to play football again, was Pat Crossan, a Heart of Midlothian player famed for his incredible speed, and so devastatingly good-looking (or so he claimed) he used to boast that women came to matches just to see him.

‘Pat can maybe pass the ball, but he couldn’t pass a mirror if he tried,’ one of his teammates once joked. In a field hospital at the Somme, Crossan came within minutes of having his left foot amputated. It was saved by a captured German surgeon.

213 professional players fell in action in WW1

The tales of these men before (and, in some cases, after) the war give this book a hugely poignant punch.

The background story of football itself is also enthralling, for then, as now, those playing it professionally seemed to be the most gilded of young men.

In 1914, there were almost 4,500 professional players in Britain, the best of them earning £4 a week legitimately, but much more ‘under the table’.

By definition, they were among the fittest of their generation, yet few of them joined up at the outbreak of war, since Football Association secretary Frederick Wallhad decreed that (unlike rugby and cricket) the season would continue regardless.

A few weeks later, author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (McCrery neglects to tell us Sherlock Holmes’s creator was an former goalkeeper) weighed in, appealing to footballers to fight for their country. Still they didn’t, causing widespread dismay.

All of the 16th Royal Scots Battalion Football Team were either gassed or wounded in battle, with some later dying from their injuries

Then, as now, those governing football seemed to be a law unto themselves.

However, the impasse was broken when 16 players for Hearts, then leading the Scottish First Division, joined a new battalion, the 16th Royal Scots.

The next day, an English MP, William Joynson-Hicks, decided to raise a battalion of footballers, the 17th Middlesex.

The 16th Royal Scots regiment, pictured in 195, were also keen footballers including Ducan Currie (far left) and Ernie Ellis (third from far left)

Needless to say, they prospered in the inter-army football tournament, beating the 34th Brigade Royal Field Artillery 11-0 in the 1916 final. They distinguished themselves on the battlefield, too, but with significant losses.

As for the 16th Royal Scots, machine-gun fire on the Somme yielded a terrible statistic: Hearts lost three of their finest players, Henry Wattie, Duncan Currie and Ernest Ellis, in under a minute.

For those of us who love football, and still more for those who make fortunes playing it, all this sacrifice should offer considerable food for thought. Gary Lineker says as much in a thoughtful foreword.

And, while McCrery’s book is not perfect, with a slightly ponderous prose style at times, I wish with all my heart a copy could be given to every Premier League player as he embarks on negotiations for another £20,000 a week.
