A robotic stick insect that can walk up stairs and negotiate stony ground has been created by scientists.

Researchers at Bielefeld University, in Germany, built the robot after studying how the legs of stick insects move.

To copy nature's design, the robotics experts gave their six robot legs a total of 18 joints that are highly elastic, allowing it to cope with uneven surfaces.

Each leg was packed with sensors to help the robot get feedback about the ground and enable the it to climb over objects. 

The legs are controlled independently to keep the robot stable, with each joint containing a drive that was designed to mimic the behaviour of stick insects.

When it comes to building intrepid robots, Boston Dynamics has created some of the most impressive. 

Among the robots it has created in a project with the US Defence Department is a humanoid shaped machine that can run, climb and jump. 

The robot can even climb across pits filling with scorpions by pressing against the opposing walls.

Another of the company's robots, named 'Cheetah', is built for maximum speed and has been filmed on a treadmill at speeds of up to 29mph, faster than Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt.

One robot called Big Dog can climb steep inclines and is even able to balance on ice.

The researchers behind the robot believe it could be used to develop new types of autonomous search and rescue vehicles.

It could also allow robots that can carry cargo over difficult terrain or help space scientists explore other planets.

Professor Alex Schneider, head of the biomechatronics research group at Bielefeld University, said: 'The way that the elasticity in Hector's drives acts is comparable to the way that muscles act in biological systems.

'However, elasticity alone is not enough for Hector to be able to walk through a natural environment containing obstacles,' says Schneider. 

'The challenge was to develop a control system that would coordinate the movements of its legs in difficult surroundings as well.'

The hexapod cognitive autonomously operating robot, or HECTOR for short, has been developed to carry loads of up to three times its own weight.

Made from carbon fibre and plastic, the exoskeleton weighs just 26lbs (12kg) but can carry a load of 66lbs (30kg). 

The hexapod cognitive autonomously operating robot, or HECTOR, can scale steps using sensors in each leg

The robotic stick insect can carry loads of up to three times its own body weight, making it perfect for carrying cargo over rough terrain or for carrying experiments to hard to reach locations on other planets 

Stony and uneven ground can pose a problem for many robots but by using drives in each joint that are based on the leg of a stick insect, researchers have been able to create a robot that can adapt to the surface

Its movement is controlled using biologically inspired algorithms, based on the way stick insects themselves move and it is designed to learn from its experiences.

The scientists have also now built a prototype that is capable of sensing its surroundings in more detail using cameras and tactile feelers.

This has given the robotic insect the ability to see and feel obstacles in its path.

'A major challenge will now be to find an efficient way to integrate these far-range sensors with the posture sensors and joint control sensors,' said Professor Volker Dürr, another engineer on the project at the biological cybernetics laboratory at Bielefeld University.

The scientists studied the legs of stick insects and developed a drive that can react to uneven ground

Sensors in the legs can detect obstacles like steps and stoney ground and help HECTOR to negotiate them
