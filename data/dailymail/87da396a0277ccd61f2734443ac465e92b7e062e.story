Tennis star Maria Sharapova hopes to change her name to Sugarpova for two weeks during the US Open to promote her brand of sweets.

The former world number one made the request to the Supreme Court of Florida on the understanding her name will change back after the tournament.

The 26-year-old spent more than £300,000 setting up her company Sugarpova, which features brightly coloured sweets with such flavours
as Smitten Sour, Quirky and Sporty.

According to The Times, Sharapova's outfit for the tournament, held at Flushing Meadows from August 26 to September 9, could also carry the compnay's logo, a pair of red lips.

It is estimated that almost 2 million bags of the sweets were sold last year, topping up Sharapova's yearly earnings to £15million.

The Russian may still need the permission of the grand slam committee but if that is granted, she could be introduced and addressed as Miss Sugarpova. Scores would also be read out in favour of her new moniker.

The news follows confirmation that Sharapova has split with coach Jimmy Connors after just one match.

'It's not the right fit for this time in my career,' Sharapova said in a statement emailed to tennis.com.

It means Sharapova is expected to go to the US Open without a coach.

The
2004 Wimbledon champion has won two tournaments this season, in Indian 
Wells and Stuttgart, but lost in the final of the French Open to Serena 
Williams who has beaten her the last 13 times the pair have met.

Earlier this month it was revealed Sharapova had hung on to her Forbes accolade for another year as she was revealed to be the highest-paid female athlete in the world.

The American company placed her at the top of the women's list with a total of £18.6million.
