Police have arrested a Minnesota woman in connection to the death of her 6-year-old cousin, who was found frozen outside her home last month.

Rachel Downer, 22, was taken into custody Friday and charged with second-degree manslaughter and felony neglect of a child.

Downer's cousin Mercedes Mayfield was discovered unconscious in the entrance to an apartment building in Bemidji on the morning of February 27 after spending hours in temperatures that fell to nearly 30 degrees-below-zero with windchill of -40.

The first-grader from Horace May Elementary School was found by both her mother and a neighbor, who both immediately called 911, said authorities.

Police said little Mercedes was dressed in a coat, boots, hat and mittens by emergency service personnel, who arrived at the scene minutes after being called.

It is not clear how the girl had managed to get outside, but it appeared she may have been there overnight.

‘The child had signs of being exposed to the frigid elements and was pronounced deceased at the scene,’ a police press release said.

Investigators say there was no history of trouble with the family, but they are trying to develop a timeline from when the child was last seen until when she was discovered.

The Ramsey County Medical Examiner's office determined that Mercedes died from hypothermia caused by exposure to frigid weather.

Investigators have not revealed any details about the charges filed against Rachel Downer, the station KSTP reported.

Downer is expected to be formally charged Monday.

Online tributes: On the day of Mercedes' death, Downer uploaded more than a half-dozen collages depicting her late 6-year-old cousin

Family torn apart: Mercedes is said to have two younger siblings, a brother and sister

On the day of Mercedes' death, the 22-year-old woman took to Facebook, posting more than a half-dozen collages depicting little Mercedes, accompanied by the status update: 'R I.P Gone but never forgotten.' 

The 6-year-old had just enrolled in first grade at Horace May Elementary within the past few days, having transferred from J.W. Smith Elementary, where she attended kindergarten and part of this school year.

Mercedes had two younger siblings, a brother and sister, who also attend the school.

Temperatures in the area reached 27-below-zero, with wind chills dropping to minus-40 degrees, according to local weather observations provided by police.

With wind chills of 40 below, experts say frostbite can set in in less than 30 minutes.

Bemidji is also only about 115 miles 
south of International Falls, Minnesota, a Canadian border town known as
 the ‘icebox of the nation’ because it often has the coldest 
temperatures in the lower 48 states.
