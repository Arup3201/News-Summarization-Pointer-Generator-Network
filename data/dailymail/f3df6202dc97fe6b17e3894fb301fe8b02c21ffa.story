The infamous 'Chosen One' banner that celebrated David Moyes' arrival at Manchester United looks set to be auctioned off for charity.

The banner took pride of place in the Stretford End last season after Moyes was anointed as United's manager by his illustrious predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson.

However, after a traumatic tenure that lasted only nine months, the banner was taken down and is now lying in an Old Trafford storage room.

'The Chosen One banner is still in a storage room at Old Trafford,' Andrew Kilduff of fans’ group Stretford End Flags told the Daily Telegraph. 'United have actually told us that it needs collecting as it belongs to us, but we just haven’t got round to it yet.

'The National Football Museum had been keen to have it, but they haven’t been back in touch, so we will probably look to auction it for charity now.

'We have auctioned a couple of banners in the past - we raised £2,000 for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s charity by selling one of his - so it would be nice to do something similar with the Chosen One.'

Sportsmail has learned that the group also turned down a £2,000 offer for the banner from a United supporter just after Moyes was sacked by the club in April, while there has also been mischievous interest from rival fans. 

The banner became a serious bone of contention as the Moyes' reign disintegrated in the second half of last season and many fans wanted the group to remove the sign before the Champions League home game against Olympiacos in March.

'We raised the money for the banner quicker than any of the previous ones,' Kilduff added. 'Because Sir Alex Ferguson had asked for the fans to back David Moyes, this seemed a good way to do it.

'It was also unveiled for a home game against Chelsea so there was a bit of dig at Jose Mourinho in there as well.

'I don’t think David Moyes ever liked it and, when fans began to call for it to be removed, we planned to hold a vote the day after the Everton game in April, but David was sacked the same day, so the decision was made for us.'
