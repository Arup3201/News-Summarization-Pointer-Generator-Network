A judge has sentenced an Oregon man to 10 years in prison on Monday for fatally stabbing his boyfriend, but the victim's mother says that's not long enough.

Tony Lopez Lozano, 35, was charged with the August 2013 murder of his boyfriend, Brian Romo, after fatally stabbing Romo in the heart following an argument at their Oregon City home, The Oregonian reports. 

Lozano pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter as part of a plea deal and, on Monday, a judge sentenced him to 10 years in prison -- much to the dismay of the victim's mother, Kathleen Tapia.

'You took a deal: 10 years. For me, that's not long enough,' Tapia said at the sentencing. 'I don't forgive you, and I never will.'

Lozano claimed that he was 'very intoxicated' when he killed Romo and, KTVZ reports, the fight came after a night of drinking at their home in the city's South End neighborhood.

A prosecutor said that Lozano 'has pretty consistently taken responsibility for [the murder].' 

However, had the case gone to trial, Lozano would have claimed that Romo was physically abusive, according to the Oregonian.

Romo's relatives said Lozano was prone to acts of violence claiming that the 35-year-old threatened to kill Romo and had stabbed him once before.

Lozano apologized to the victim's family during the sentencing but told Tapia that she was abusive and he was glad he'd never see her again.
