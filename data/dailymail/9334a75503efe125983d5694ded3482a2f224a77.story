A baby boy who weighed less than a bag of sugar after being born three months prematurely has survived, and his incredible journey to good health has been documented by his doting father.

These photographs show Saxon on the day he entered the world at just 26 weeks, weighing just 1lb 12oz, and today, as a strapping eight-month-old boy with his siblings.

Parents Heidi and Edmund Shum, from Llanelli, west Wales, feared their son might not survive, but believe his story will be an inspiration to others.

Fight for life: Saxon on the day he was born on April 27 last year. He was three months early and weighed just 1lb 12oz but happily is now a strapping eight-month-old boy

When Heidi Shum, 40, unexpectedly went into labour before her due date she feared the worst.

She said: 'We weren’t really trying for a baby when I fell pregnant. I was approaching 40 so I thought perhaps my age would act against me. But we were thrilled when it happened.

'It was a very emotional journey - when Saxon was born he could fit into the palm of my hand, he was about the size of a slice of bread.

'He was in hospital for five months, and while there were low points as well as happy days, Ed captured them all.'

Mr Shum said he thought it was important to document his son’s journey to make the most of the couple’s first days with their son, and to show Saxon when he gets older.

'I wanted to capture his life as a baby, as babies don’t stay babies for long,' he said.

'I naturally take photos to tell a story. To this day, when I tell people how small Saxon was when he was born, I find it hard to believe, and I find myself cross-referencing with my photos.

'The only people allowed to see Saxon were my wife and I, so taking photos meant we could update everyone with Saxon’s progress while using those photos to preserve memories. 

'Memories fade away, and little details get lost, but photographs will last forever and help you live the moment again. In our case, it reminds us every single day how lucky we were that Saxon fought his way out of hospital and safely home.'

In the collection there are pictures of Saxon which capture his fight for life, featuring photos of the family, as well as high resolution close-ups. 

The series of photographs, which begin with a picture taken on Saxon’s birthday on April 27th 2013, show Saxon growing and putting on weight as he gets stronger.

In one of the photographs, Edmund captures the moment Saxon appears to be waving at his older brothers Elliot 11, and Dexter 4, as they stare at him through the window in the hospital.

Mrs Shum said: 'It wasn’t easy - there were many complications along the way, everything which could go wrong seemed to happen. Saxon suffered two bleeds on the brain, a lung infection, bowel disease and a blood infection, among other things.

'The nurses at Singleton Hospital in Swansea were absolutely amazing and really taught me the importance of expressing milk to help Saxon grow and get stronger. 

'They were like angels, and Ed’s pictures of Saxon have now been put up in the hospital to show the importance of breastfeeding.

'It was a very frightening time, but all the way through Saxon’s fight we took photographs and emailed them to a special account to show him when he’s older. 

'I look at them now and they bring me to tears. I never lost hope that my little boy was going to survive.

Saxon was born unexpectedly and prematurely in a hospital in Wales and spent a lot of his early life fighting for survival among health problems, but soon grew to a healthy eight-month-old

'Before he was born, I didn’t know anything about premature babies. My son Dexter was born one month premature but it was nothing compared to what happened with Saxon. 

'Hopefully expectant mothers, and mothers going through a similar dark time, will be able to see these pictures and know there is hope.'

The couple suffered one more set-back in July. Just as they were ready to take Saxon home, he developed a hernia of the groin and had to undergo an operation. He eventually left hospital in September.

Mrs Shum said: 'We had his stuff all packed and we were just about to put him into the car seat when the doctor realised he had the hernia.

'It was upsetting as his brothers really wanted to meet him and hadn’t been allowed to do so.

'So they met him at the hospital instead. It was very emotional. 

'When we were finally allowed to take him home, he weighed 5lbs 7oz. He wasn’t very big, but was huge compared to the size he was. 

'I was thrilled to have all my boys under one roof, after five months of driving back and forth almost every hour, and now we are happier than ever. 

'Everyday I am thankful for my family and the way we stuck together through something so difficult.Mrs Shum now plans to set up a support network for mothers of premature babies.

The parents stayed in the hospital until Saxon was ready to come home. Saxon soon started putting on a lot of weight, to the delight of his parents, and eventually he grew into a healthy baby
