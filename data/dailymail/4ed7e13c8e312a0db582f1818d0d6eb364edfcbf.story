Ever worried how your child would fare in the big bad world on their own? Have you wondered if they would hold down a respectable job and thrive away from the family home? 

Well you can soon find out - a new fake town called Kidzania is being built in Westfield shopping centre in west London that provides the experience of independent living for children aged between four and 12 years old. 

Kids who visit the 75,000 sq ft mini city for the day arrive via flight simulation, which has been built by British Airways and will be partly-operated by children. 

Kidzania is a new 75,000 sq ft fake town being built in west London, which aims to teach children aged four to 12 about careers. Kids become dentists, radio presenters and firemen to earn money that they can spend on food, shopping and beauty treatments among other things 

After opening a fake bank account, the children are handed a cashpoint card loaded with 50 KidZos.

They can use this cash to do things like buy food, take a bus-driven tour of the town, undergo beauty treatments or go shopping. 

But 50 KidZos doesn't last long, so children are encouraged to get one of the many jobs on offer to them in Kidzania in order to earn more cash. 

There are more than 60 jobs to choose from, including police officer, surgeon, fireman, dentist, beauty therapist. chef, smoothie maker and even tattoo artist.

The fake town has a fully-functioning fire station where children learn about the importance of fire safety and are called upon to put out fake blazes 

While parents pay a £28 entry fee for each child, a large bulk of the expense is also fronted by sponsors like Innocent drinks, who participate in the city by manning the operations. 

For instance, children will take on jobs at an Innocent smoothie 'factory' in the city, where they are taught to make one of the drinks, while also learning about different fruits from around the world. 

Global Radio - who owns stations including Heart FM and Capital FM - have come on board to provide a special Kidzania radio station, where children can try their hand at being producers, newsreaders, traffic and showbiz reporters, or radio presenters. 

Children can also take on jobs in a hospital and a dentist surgery   

Jobs including nurses, doctors, surgeons and ambulance drivers at the town's hospital are available 

For the wannabe petrol heads, car company Renault is hosting a pit lane experience where kids are paired into teams and trained to change the tyres of a purpose-built, scale model e.dams-Renault Formula E car, before performing the tyre change under race conditions. 

There is also a hospital where children can become surgeons, nurses and ambulancemen and a fully-functioning fire station, complete with working fire engines. 

For the more fashion-conscious, H&M is hosting a clothing design studio. 

Children arrive at Kidzania via a fake plane flight, which is provided by British Airways. Children can learn about roles including a pilot at the flight academy 

Children can also become chefs at some of the many food outlets in the town

The town even has its own hotel, where children can learn how to manage the reception and housekeeping duties. 

The idea of Kidzania is for children to experience different jobs and have their eyes opened to the importance of careers, all the while enjoying themselves.

Joel Cadbury, Chairman of KidZania London, said: 'It has been exciting to work with the (sponsors) on creating establishments and activities that exceed anything we dreamt of.' 

There are already several Kidzania towns in operation across the world, in places including Tokyo, Lisbon, Santa Fe, Istanbul and Mumbai and the London version is expected to open in March next year.
