Virginia's highest court threw out a wrongful death verdict today over the 2007 university massacre that killed 32 people.

The case 
had been brought by the families of two students - Erin Nicole Peterson and Julia Kathleen Pryde - who argued that the women might have survived if Virginia Tech administrators had alerted students earlier about the gunman.

The Supreme Court concluded however, that the university did not have a duty to warn students after the bodies of two students were found in a dormitory.

The justices agreed with the state, saying there was no way to anticipate student Seung-Hui Cho's deadly intentions.

'Thus, as a matter of law, the 
commonwealth did not have a duty to protect students against third party
criminal acts,' the court wrote.

Jurors in Montgomery County ruled in 
March last year that the state was negligent in the deaths of Miss Peterson, 18, and Miss Pryde, 23, who were 
killed in the deadliest mass shooting in 
modern U.S. history.

Jurors had awarded the families of both 
students $4 million each, but a judge reduced the award to the state cap
of $100,000 for each family.

Campus safety advocates have said the decision will not shake the heightened diligence at American universities, saying improved security is the 'living legacy' of the victims.

'The April 16, 2007, tragedy forever changed campus safety,' said S. Daniel Carter, director of 32 National Campus Safety Initiative, named for the number of Virgina Tech victims.

'This court ruling does nothing to diminish that,' he said.

Since the killings, campuses have instituted warning systems that use cell phone alerts and sirens.

'We draw strength knowing that the 32 innocent lives tragically lost were not in vain,' the VTV Family Outreach Foundation, a nonprofit established by the families of victims and survivors, said in a statement.

'Institutions, including Virginia Tech, now often have mass notifications out to their entire campus within minutes rather than hours after any serious incident occurs.'

In Thursday's decision, the justices reversed a jury's findings and issued a final ruling, meaning there is no avenue for appeal.

In response, the state attorney general's office said in a statement that the court 'found what we have said all along to be true'.

Spokesman Brian Gottstein wrote in an email: 'The commonwealth and its officials at Virginia Tech were not negligent on April 16, 2007. Cho was the lone person responsible for this tragedy.'

The case was the lone pending legal action from the massacre, Mr Gottstein said.

At the trial in the case last year jurors found that the state should have issued more timely campus warnings after the dormitory shooting.

The trial focused on the time between the first shootings, shortly after 7am, and the killings at Norris Hall, shortly before 10am. A campus-wide email at 9:50am warned of a gunman and advised students to remain inside.

By then, Cho had chained the Norris Hall doors and continued with his massacre.

The state argued that law enforcement officials believed the first shootings were the result of a domestic dispute, and had concluded the larger campus wasn't at risk.

The justices concluded that university officials acted properly.

The Petersons and Prydes are the only families of Virginia Tech victims who did not join an $11 million settlement.

Their attorneys have shielded the families from the media, but they have said they were intent on holding university officials accountable for their actions on April 16, 2007.

The state was the only defendant at trial. In a statement, Virginia Tech president Charles Steger, extended his gratitude to state attorneys who argued the appeal.

A university statement said the ruling 'can never reverse the loss of lives nor the pain experienced by so many families and friends of victims of one person'.

Andrew Goddard, whose son Colin was wounded in the attack, said he found the ruling upsetting.

'I think it certainly takes the pressure off universities,' he wrote in an email to The Associated Press. 'I would hope that all future freshman orientations clearly spell out that, despite all the policy changes and advanced notification systems, the university actually has no "duty" to use them. Let's see how parents react to that.'
