More A&E departments will have to close for safety reasons as they are weeded out under a tough new hospital inspection regime, the new boss of the health watchdog has admitted.

Some hospitals ‘will find it difficult’ to prove their A&Es are up to scratch as they come under renewed scrutiny by inspectors from the Care Quality Commission, the regulator’s chairman David Prior warned.

His comments in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday raise the possibility of more fights over closures in the next two years, which could be increasingly difficult for the Government in the run-up to the General Election.

Since 2007, eight A&Es across England and Wales have closed and a further 18 are threatened.

Many face closure on the premise that centralising services will save lives, but Mr Prior said the public had yet to be convinced.

Between now and Christmas the CQC will be going into 18 hospital trusts, which together run 24  A&Es, to undertake thorough inspections.

Six of those trusts, which run ten A&Es, have been identified as being at high risk of providing sub-standard care.

The CQC wants to have inspected all of England’s 161 major hospital trusts by 2015.

Mr Prior thought the CQC’s  beefed-up inspection regime, which includes doctors and nurses from elsewhere and patients going into hospitals, would find that some emergency departments were unsafe.

Labour last night said the Government was presiding over an ‘unprecedented summer crisis’ in A&E after new figures showed a sharp increase in waiting times.

The number of hospital trusts missing the target of seeing  95 per cent of patients within four hours shot up from 38 to 57 – a rise of 50 per cent over last summer.

It means that 40 per cent of England’s biggest A&E departments are now missing the target.

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘Patients are given dates for their long-awaited operations, only to be put back on the waiting list as hospitals grapple with the A&E crisis.

‘David Cameron is presiding over the first summer A&E crisis in living memory.’

‘This may drive further reconfiguration, driven by patient safety, not driven by financial considerations,’ he said.

Some hospitals simply did not have enough senior doctors to provide safe A&E care.

‘If you take A&E, the availability of consultant doctors 24/7 – or for at least 16 hours a day – is really important,’ he added.

‘Now it’s bloody hard for a small hospital to provide that kind of cover, because it’s so expensive. I think the reality is that some smaller A&Es will find it difficult.’

He went on: ‘If we are going to get reconfigurations in the NHS, I think it’s much more acceptable if it’s driven by patient safety and quality, than by financial reasons.’

Among the six ‘high-risk’ trusts to be inspected soon is the Barking, Havering and Redbridge NHS Trust in Essex.

It runs A&Es at Queen’s Hospital in Romford and King George Hospital in Goodmayes, the latter due to close in 2015.

Local councillor Andy Walker, of the Save King George Hospital campaign, said: ‘There is truth in the argument that centralising specialist services for conditions like strokes and heart trauma save lives.

'But there are loads of clinicians  who say that for other conditions, particularly among the elderly, speed is vital. These people will need a consultant as soon as possible. I believe there’s still a need for district general hospitals.’

Another of the six ‘high-risk’ trusts is Barts and the London NHS Trust – England’s biggest – which runs three A&Es in East London including one at Whipps Cross Hospital.

Barts is losing £2 million a week and is at risk of ‘financial failure’, chief executive Peter Morris said recently.

Rumours are circulating among staff that Whipps Cross’s A&E could be axed too, but this has been denied by the trust.

On Thursday, Ministers announced that struggling A&Es would get an extra £500 million over two years to help ease some of the pressure, although critics have dismissed the cash injection as a ‘sticking-plaster’ solution.
