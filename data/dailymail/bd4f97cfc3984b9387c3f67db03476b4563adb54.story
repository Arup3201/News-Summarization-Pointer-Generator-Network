Record numbers of patients are turning up at overstretched A&E departments, figures showed last night.

Amid rising concerns about the failure of GPs to offer services out of hours, it was revealed that 296,667 people attended casualty in the week ending May 25.

The weekly figure for England is the highest on record, Labour said – and indicates that the NHS is facing a summer A&E crisis. In the same week last year, the total attending casualty was 273,477.

The huge numbers going to casualty mean that tens of thousands are having to wait more than four hours before they are treated.

Last night a leading doctor said lives will be ‘endangered’ by the increasing pressure on A&E units.

Critics say the pressure is being made worse by the failure of family doctors to open at evenings, weekends and – as the Mail revealed on Monday – in the afternoons.

An investigation found that a quarter of GP surgeries shut their office for at least one half-day during the week, while others close for more than four hours for lunch.

Patients who ring at these times are either diverted to out-of-hours firms or hear a message telling them to call back. It is feared that many head to A&E on hearing such messages.

The official NHS figures show that of the 296,667 who turned up at A&E in England in the week ending May 25, 77,745 were admitted to a hospital ward. That is also a record.

The NHS is supposed to meet a target that 95 per cent of patients should be assessed, treated or discharged in casualty departments within four hours.

But in that week, 24,503 people had to wait longer than four hours – below the target at 94.6 per cent.

Over the whole of May, a total of 92,811 waited more than four hours before being treated. This is much higher than the 57,810 recorded over the same period last year, the 57,352 in 2012 and the 48,259 in 2011. In each of the four weeks this May, the 95 per cent target was missed.

Casualty units usually face a more difficult time over the winter, but the latest figures indicate the situation could be even worse this summer.

Dr Clifford Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said the statistics underlined the need for ‘significant action’. He wants the NHS to provide more alternatives to A&E such as better GP out-of-hours services or more minor injuries units.

Dr Mann also called for greater efforts to ease congestion so patients can be moved out of casualty and into other wards. ‘Failure to do so will mean these figures go from bad to worse and lives are endangered,’ he said.

Jamie Reed, a Labour health spokesman, said: ‘People can see that the NHS is heading downhill under this government.

‘A&Es are facing the worst year in a decade – there’s now a summer crisis that’s worse than the winter one.’

The Department of Health said: ‘More than 400,000 patients were seen at A&E within four hours last week – a testament to the hard work of staff.’
