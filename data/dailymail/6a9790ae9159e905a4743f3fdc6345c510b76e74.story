Former Hull forward Dean Windass is to become the club's first official ambassador, it has been confirmed.

Windass made his debut for his hometown club in 1991 and, after scoring 57 goals in four years, he was sold to Aberdeen in December 1995 for £700,000 which helped offset Hull's tax problems.

Following spells at Oxford United, Bradford City, Middlesbrough and Sheffield United, Windass returned to Hull in January 2007, helping the Tigers stay up before scoring the winner in the 2008 Championship play-off final against Bristol City to secure their promotion to the Premier League.

Windass will officially take up his new role on February 2, having already become a familiar figure behind the scenes at the KC Stadium on match days and recently representing the Tigers at the Premier League Live event in India.

'I have always had a special affinity with the club and always will do,' said Windass, who will also have a role within the club's media department as well as going out to local schools and community events.

'I spent many happy years at the club and achieved some of my greatest sporting accolades whilst playing here, so I was delighted to be asked to take up this role.

'The great thing is I love the club and I will have the best interests of Hull City at heart as I go about my work.

'The ambassador role is perfect. I love dealing with people face to face, I am a people person, so it is a fantastic challenge and one I can't wait to start.

'Hull City has always been my club - since I was six years of age - and I look forward to working with the owners and all the office staff to try and promote us across our region and beyond.'
