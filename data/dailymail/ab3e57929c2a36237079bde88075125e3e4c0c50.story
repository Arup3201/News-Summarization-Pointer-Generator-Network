California's current drought is being billed as the driest period in the state's recorded rainfall history.

A pair of satellite images released by NASA reveal the shocking impact of California's drought, which is now entering its third year.

The NOAA images show how the state's landscape is parched with minimal snow cover and the land dried out compared to the same time last year.

Record drought: These satellite images show the parched California landscape this year compared to a normal year with plenty of foliage and snow coverage last year

NASA posted the images just days after California governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency due to low rainfall.

Brown
 urged Californians to conserve water, warning that the state faces 
potential water shortages, crop losses, and an increase in wildfires if 
significant precipitation doesn't come soon.

The
 images, captured on NASA’s Terra satellite, show a steep decline in 
snow cover across the Sierra Nevada, Coast Range, and Cascade Mountains.

Both the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys appeared parched, with a noticeable drop in greenness.

The
 most striking difference between the two years is the amount of snow 
cover on mountains. The Sierra Nevada range has very little snow, and 
Coast Range and Cascade Mountains are almost completely snow free,' said
 NASA in a post on the Image of the Day section of its Earth Observatory
 web site. 

'California gets a third of its water supply from mountain snow, but with warm, dry weather, little snow has accumulated.'

'Less
 striking at first glance, but just as telling is the condition of the 
vegetation west of the Sierra Nevada. In 2013—a year into the 
drought—the central valley was green with growing crops. The coastal 
hills were also green from winter rain. In 2014, everything west of the 
forested mountains is brown.

Even irrigated agriculture in the center of the state appears to be limited compared to 2013.'

Land is exposed by the extremely low water level of Lake Kaweah on February 5, 2014 near Visalia, California. Now in its third straight year of unprecedented drought, California is experiencing its driest year on record, dating back 119 years and possible the worst in the past 500 years.

California
 in 2013 received less rain than in any year since it became a state in 
1850. And at least one Bay Area scientist says that based on tree ring 
data, the current rainfall season is on pace to be the driest since 1580
 — more than 150 years before George Washington was born.

A megadrought today would have catastrophic effects.

California,
 the nation's most populous state with 38 million residents, has built a
 massive economy, Silicon Valley, Hollywood and millions of acres of 
farmland, all in a semiarid area.

The state's dams, canals and 
reservoirs have never been tested by the kind of prolonged drought that 
experts say will almost certainly occur again.

The
 dry year California experienced in 2013 has left fresh water reservoirs
 with a fraction of their normal reserves and slowed the normally full 
American River so dramatically that brush and dry riverbed are showing 
through in areas normally teeming with fish.

'We
 can't make it rain, but we can be much better prepared for the terrible
 consequences that California's drought now threatens, including 
dramatically less water for our farms and communities and increased 
fires in both urban and rural areas,' Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, 
said in a statement.

'I've declared this emergency and I'm calling all Californians to conserve water in every way possible,' he said, in a move that will allow him to call for conservation measures and provide flexibility in deciding state water priorities.

In a sign of the severity of the drought, some of the state's reservoirs are at their lowest levels in years. The Folsom Reservoir near Sacramento is so low that the remains of a Gold Rush-era ghost town - flooded to create the lake in the 1950s - are visible for the first time in years.

The state's mountain ranges, where runoff from melting snow provides much of the water for California's thirsty cities and farms, have just 20 per cent of the snow they normally have at this time of year, officials noted.

Lake Kaweah: Grasslands that support cattle have dried up, forcing ranchers to feed them expensive supplemental hay to keep them from starving or to sell at least some of their herds, and farmers are struggling with diminishing crop water and what to plant or whether to tear out permanent crops which use water year-round such, as almond trees

Parched: Water levels for many of California's major reservoirs are well below average and dropping; concern is mounting that California may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s, or even worse, 1977

Lake Shasta, the largest reservoir in California, is down from its historical average by nearly half.

Other sources of water, including the massive Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, are also affected, prompting cities to dip into reserves and forcing farmers to scramble. Some public agencies may be able to purchase just five per cent of the water that they contracted to buy from the state.

Adding to concerns, January and February are usually the wettest months in much of the state, but 2014 has so far been mostly dry, with little precipitation expected, according to the National Weather Service.

In declaring a drought emergency, Brown said he did not know if he would be successful in persuading the federal government to free up funds for drought relief but he would try his best.

'It's important, first of all, to awaken all Californians to the serious matter of drought,' he said, also warning of upcoming 'conflicts and different perceptions on how water is to be allocated.'

Water has long been a contentious issue in California, where it has been diverted from mountain lakes and streams to irrigate farms and slake the thirst of metropolitan areas.

Many of the state's efforts to deal with the problem are controversial, including a $25 billion plan to divert water from above the delta by sending it through a pair of huge tunnels.

For many in the state's $44.7 billion agriculture business, water scarcity is a problem made worse by a recent switch to orchard-style crops such as almonds and olives. Unlike vegetables or cotton, which grow in fields that can be left fallow in dry years, the trees need water every year.

Already, there were signs of competing priorities among groups that contend for water and will be closely watching how state officials use their new flexibility in allocating it.

Assemblywoman Connie Conway, the leader of the Republican minority in the state Assembly who represents a heavily agricultural area in central California, expressed hope that with the declaration more water could go toward 'Valley farmers and workers who depend on water to feed the world.'

John McManus, executive director of the Golden Gate Salmon Association, said his group's concern was for the health of salmon and a fishing industry that supports tens of thousands of jobs in California and Oregon.

'If the drought declaration results in more attention to saving the salmon that are in the Sacramento Valley rivers, and which are in dire need of attention, then that is good thing,' he said.

Doug Obegi, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said California has a complex system that allocates water to areas that laid claim to it first - often over 100 years ago - and which many view the system as unfair.

'Because it's so contentious, there are times when it's hard to make progress,' Obegi said.

But in some ways the state has done well. Over the last 40 years, the state's agriculture industry has doubled the revenue per drop of water used, largely from improved efficiency and changes in the plants grown, Obegi said.
