NHS bosses have been accused of ‘rationing’ the amount of sex men with impotence problems can have.

They have told doctors to prescribe no more than one pill of ‘generic’ Viagra a week to each patient they see. 

The managers sent the note even though unbranded versions of Viagra, called sildenafil, are now cheap. A four-pill pack costs the NHS just £1.45, or 36p a tablet.

'Rationing':  Some NHS bosses have told doctors to prescribe no more than one pill of ‘generic’ Viagra a week to each patient they see (file picture of model)

The price of the anti-impotence pills has plummeted 93 per cent in the past year, since Viagra-maker Pfizer lost its patent.

As a result, the Department of Health recently scrapped rules on prescribing sildenafil, so the vast majority of men with erectile dysfunction problems can get it on the NHS. 

But that decision – revealed in The Mail on Sunday last week – appears to have worried some local health managers fighting to balance their books.

Cheap: Tablets of sildenafil, an unbranded version of Viagra used by the NHS, cost just 36p each

In a missive to GPs in the West Midlands, managers at NHS Telford and Wrekin Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) demanded GPs limit their prescribing of sildenafil. 

They wrote: ‘In light of the pressure on NHS budgets, patients who are eligible for NHS treatment should be prescribed the lowest effective dose, with a maximum frequency of ONE tablet per week (ie FOUR per MONTH).’

But Dr Martin Duerden, a North Wales GP who advises the Royal College of General Practitioners on prescribing issues, asked: ‘Can we ration sex in this way? 

Prescriptions for sildenafil have no restrictions and each person should be assessed as individuals – some will need more, some less.’

GPs are free to prescribe what they like, based on what they think best for the patient, so such notes can only be advisory. 

However, CCGs can make life difficult for doctors they believe are costing them too much.

NHS West Essex CCG has also warned doctors to look out for patients who might sell the pills for a profit. 

‘Consider these drugs have a street value and quantities should be agreed after a discussion with the patient assessing realistic needs,’ they said.

A spokesman for NHS West Essex CCG stressed it was not capping how much sildenafil doctors could prescribe, saying it was up to GPs.

NHS Telford and Wrekin CCG did not comment.
