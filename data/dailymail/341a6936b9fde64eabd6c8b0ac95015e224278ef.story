He was sacked for punching a junior TV producer after not getting a hot dinner.

And judging by the extensive list of backstage luxuries demanded by Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear Live co presenters, it seems a miracle he hadn’t previously lashed out.

The three-page catalogue was revealed after BBC producer Oisin Tymon, who felt Clarkson’s wrath, said he did not want to press charges.

Very specific requests include over 20 bottles of wine, such as Veuve Clicquot Champagne, Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir and Sauvignon Blanc.

Also required is Chateau Leoube rosé or equivalent which – at Clarkson’s insistence - must be ‘pale DRY… preferably southern France.’

In case that runs out, they ask for two dozen bottles of Peroni beer, Bombay Sapphire gin plus tonic, ice and lemon, all chilled in a fridge or cooler cabinet with at least four shelves.

Their drinks must be served on linen covered tables, while a sofa must be provided with ‘enough room to seat six people, one of whom is 6ft 3in and likes to lie down’.

The stars also insist on a Nespresso coffee machine with a milk frothing gadget, balsamic vinegar, Dove deodorant, hair wax, ‘nice rubbish bins’ and a coat stand – ‘NOT a rail!’

In all, there are about 120 different items listed for the green room which Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May use to relax in during breaks from hosting the Top Gear Live events, which take place at arenas in the UK and abroad, and are separate from the BBC TV show.

The rooms – often the size of a hotel suite – must be fitted with a rug if there are no carpets, soft lighting, a TV with good speaker system and Sky Sports and movies, an array of films on DVD and green plants - ideally bamboo.

Smoker Clarkson insists on a carton of Marlboro Lights and as well as packets of Camels and Marlboro Menthol Lights.

And in a move which might have pre-empted the attack that ended Clarkson’s BBC career, the list also insists the green room must be located near a McDonald’s, stating: ‘THEY WILL ASK FOR THIS’.

A source from Top Gear Live told the Mail: ‘All three presenters have their eclectic tastes and they certainly know what they want.

‘Jeremy is very into his rosé and very particular about getting exactly the right type of wine.

‘He also likes to be driven around in a Range Rover during these events.

‘It’s fair to say he can be a little bit of a Prima Donna at times.’

Clarkson is alleged to have been drinking Rose for three hours before he hit TV producer Oisin Tymon, who had told him that he wasn’t able to have steak and chips at Simonstone Hall in North Yorkshire following a day’s filming.

Two planned Top Gear Live events for this weekend in Norway were postponed after the 54-year-old presenter was suspended and later fired over the fracas.

Details of the stars’ demands come from a ‘green room rider’ list from 29 November 2014 – the date of the last Top Gear Live event in the Norwegian capital Oslo.

Soft drinks on the list included 12 small bottles of ginger beer, a selection of Cokes and Red Bull, and still and sparkling bottled water.

Food includes ‘lunch and evening meals and hot snacks, eg pies, jacket potatoes, pasta and prawn cocktail.’

Greek, chicken Caesar and Nicoise salads are requested as a ‘healthy option’ along with a daily fruit bowl.

But there are also demands for sweets including jelly babies and minstrels and cheese and cracker boards. Marmite, honey, jam, peanut butter, HP Sauce, salt crackers and a bottle of balsamic vinegar are also listed.

There is no direct mention of steak, but steak knives are included on the list.

The rider states that trestle tables are expected ‘for the presentation of food and drink’ and ‘table linen for all tables not in good condition!’

Very specific requests from Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond include over 20 bottles of wine, such as Veuve Clicquot Champagne, Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir and Sauvignon Blanc

The room also has to include a Sky TV connection or way to access live sports and films, Apple TV or Netflix and a selection of DVDs including James Bond films, Blood Diamond and motorbike movie Closer to the Edge.

Other movies required on DVD include Hangover Part 3, Miami Vice and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

It also lists a Playstation 3 with two controllers plus the Call of Duty game.

The source added: ‘Some of the items are brought over by his team from venue to venue around the globe but others they get people on the ground to buy ready for their arrival.

‘They don’t always need everything or eat and drink everything on the list, but they like to have them there just in case.’

The green rooms vary in size depending on the venue, but are often the equivalent of a hotel suite.

During most Top Gear Live events the presenters – and anyone they invite to join them – spend a few hours in the room during rehearsals on Friday and before and after shows on Saturday and Sundays. They usually stay in hotels or private houses overnight.

The rider was put together by PR firm R:evolution Communications and Events, which worked on the Top Gear Live shows.

One of the firm’s directors, Emma Stonier, was unavailable for comment, while another, Rebecca Banks, declined to answer questions at her Oxfordshire home when she was shown the document.

But a former business associate of the pair, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘I know there were lists like this for Top Gear with very specific requests. It sounds about right.’

Oisin Tymon’s solicitor, Paul Daniels, indicated the producer wanted to draw a line under the affair.

Mr Daniels said: ‘Mr Tymon doesn’t want to press charges. The matter has taken a great toll on Oisin, his family and his friends.

‘Quite simply, Mr Tymon just wishes to return now to the job at the BBC he loves, as soon as possible.’
