She is a former model who has been repeatedly cast as the beautiful love interest during a 20-year film career – but Cameron Diaz today warns against telling girls they are pretty.

In an exclusive interview with You magazine, the star of There’s Something About Mary and The Counsellor, left, says girls are under too much pressure to ‘look good’.

Diaz, who is working on a new film adaptation of the musical Annie, said: ‘On the set of Annie, we have all these little super-sweet girls who are extras and they come up to me and say, “Oh Cammie, you are so pretty, your hair is so pretty, your clothes are so pretty.”

‘And that’s sweet, but it worries me that girls are conditioned to value themselves and judge each other by the way they look.

'I try to let them know that being “pretty” will not sustain them.’

The
 actress adds: ‘I resist that instinctive urge to say, “Oh, you are so 
cute” and instead ask, “What grade are you in at school?” or “What is 
your favourite subject?”

Insight: Diaz’s comments on body image appear in her new lifestyle guide called The Body Book

‘Because
 every time we address our daughters or our nieces by saying, “You look 
lovely today” we are reinforcing the idea that the most important thing 
for a woman is to look good.’

Diaz’s
 comments on body image appear in her new lifestyle guide called The 
Body Book, an extract from which is also included in this week’s You 
magazine.

However, the 41-year-old reveals she was less body-confident at the start of her career.

‘I had such bad acne that I spent half my time trying to hide from my friends, from the cameras, from everyone,’ she explains.

‘So I wrote the book for my 16-year-old self, who I look back on and think, “Why didn’t I know these things back then?” ’
