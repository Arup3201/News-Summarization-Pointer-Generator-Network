The UEFA Congress in Vienna next month is seen as the best occasion for a public debate between the four candidates for the FIFA presidency.

Prince Ali of Jordan, launching his campaign in London on Tuesday, called for just such a TV occasion, saying he was ‘ready to do it’ and urging president Sepp Blatter to commit along with the other contenders, Michal van Praag and Luis Figo.

Ali said: ‘If we are talking about transparency, I would like to see a public debate including the incumbent — so everyone across the world knows what our positions are.’

However, the chances of Blatter, who has most to lose from a live inquest, agreeing to such exposure are slim and FIFA would not comment on the issue.

Ali has been nominated by Belarus, Malta, England, Jordan, the United States and Georgia, which means only his home country from his own Asian football confederation are supporting him. He said: ‘I don’t see this as a confederation issue. It’s a worldwide vote.’

Ali blames his lack of backing in Asia on Blatter’s long reign and a ‘culture of intimidation within FIFA in which people who take a principled stand are being punished’.

With the AFC leadership loyal to Blatter’s cause, Ali faces a fight even to be voted back on to the FIFA executive. But the Sandhurst- educated Prince does not intend to stay on in Zurich if he fails to become president.

‘I cannot see myself in FIFA for the next four years,’ he said.

Meanwhile, the FA have nominated Ali but may not vote for him on May 29. They will wait to hear the views of Van Praag and Figo before deciding who is most likely to topple Blatter.

A yellow-jacketed Robbie Savage leading BT Sport’s parody of the Sky Sports branding for transfer deadline day was hardly backed up by audience figures for their rival programme. 

In the last 15 minutes of transfer activity, there were an average of just 4,000 viewing BT Sport, compared to almost 700,000 watching on Sky.

The women’s FA Cup final is to be staged at Wembley for the first time this season following the great success of the England v Germany international last November in drawing a crowd of 55,000.

Kelly Simmons, the FA’s director of women’s football, made a presentation proposing a Wembley final to the FA board last week and it was well received. Last year’s final attracted a crowd of 15,000 to MK Dons.

The astonishing cull at the England and Wales Cricket Board continues with the heads of marketing, commercial and digital told to re-apply for other jobs because they will not be keeping their present ones. An ECB spokesman: ‘This is an internal process and we aren’t prepared to comment further on individual roles.’

FA CHIEF LEFT PUZZLED 

Nick Humby, the newly appointed interim chief operating officer of the FA, is well respected in the sports industry. But who on earth would want to buy a 300-piece portrait puzzle of the former Manchester United finance director, available for £19.99 on Amazon?

As one customer review put it: ‘Like most of you reading this, I have the Nick Humby bath mat, drink coasters and cat litter tray but the jigsaw is the icing on the cake.’

Carlton Cole’s upset at his move from West Ham to West Bromwich breaking down at the last minute wasn’t just directed at manager Sam Allardyce, who pulled the plug after Tottenham refused to share Emmanuel Adebayor’s wages during a proposed loan spell at Upton Park. 

Cole was also furious with a number of agents for trying to muscle in on his aborted transfer.

There is plenty of bad feeling between Spurs and West Ham, with Hammers co-owner David Gold saying of Spurs chairman Daniel Levy: ‘There are people out there you just can’t do business with.’

However, they are expected to be civil when they meet at Thursday's Premier League summit, where Levy never says much. The most hostile exchanges have been between Ken Bates and David Dein.
