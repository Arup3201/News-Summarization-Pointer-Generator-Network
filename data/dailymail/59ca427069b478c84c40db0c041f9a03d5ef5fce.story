When Manuel Pellegrini was asked on Tuesday about Manchester City players not believing in their coach, he told the Spanish journalist asking the question that the same enquiry could easily have been made of Barcelona’s manager Luis Enrique just two months earlier.

He was spot-on too. Back at the start of January Barca’s head coach sat ghost-like through press conferences – a condemned man after a fall-out with the one man at Barcelona you don’t fall-out with – Lionel Messi.

Barcelona had just been beaten 1-0 by David Moyes' Real Sociedad, the president Josep Bartomeu had sacked sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta and called elections for the end of the season.

And Javier Mascherano had gone on a one-man media mission to convince everyone that all talk of training ground bust-ups and sour air in the Barca dressing room was the product of reporters’ fertile imagination.

It wasn’t. And off-message French defender Jeremy Mathieu admitted as such in an interview with French radio saying that Messi had indeed had a heated argument with Enrique in a training session before the first game of the year.

Since that defeat by Real Sociedad, Barcelona have devoured all that has been put before them barring one slip against Malaga. 

Luis Suarez is still setting up team-mates as he was towards the end of last year but he is now in the kind of scoring form that saw him win the Golden Boot last season, and Messi has gone from being 12 goals behind Cristiano Ronaldo in the La Liga scoring stakes to two goals in front him.

What happened? Player power is what happened. 

What most upset squad members at the start of the year is that three of their number – Dani Alves, Messi and Neymar – had been given permission to come back slightly later than the rest from the mid-winter break but were then left out of that first game of the new year because, according to Enrique, they had not trained sufficiently.

The players had had enough of the mixed messages and of the constant changes in starting line-ups. And they made themselves heard.

From that moment on Luis Enrique’s team changes were drastically reduced. He began to leave out one star-player at a time instead of making wholesale changes and with the emphasis now on the players to deliver because they had won their internal battle with the coach they began performing at a level not seen since Tito Vilanova was in charge two seasons before.

There are still disagreements between coach and players. Suarez was unhappy about being taken off two weeks ago and at the weekend Neymar responded in the same way when he was taken off at Eibar.

Neither would it be fair to say that Luis Enrique is now a puppet being made to dance solely to Messi’s tune. One of his strengths as a manager is that he gets the players fit and keeps them fit throughout the season, and Barca players look strong with 11 games left to play plus the Copa del Rey final.

The manager has loosened the reigns since January's blow up and his team is now difficult to stop

His assistant Juan Carlos Unzue should also be credited with the transformation in the way they take and defend corners. Barca had taken over 100 set plays at the start of the season without making a training ground routine render a single goal on the pitch. 

But all that has changed of late with ‘unusual’ suspects Jordi Alba and Messi both getting their heads to important corners – Alba with an assist and Messi scoring his first header from a corner in his Barcleona career.

Luis Enrique has played his part in the revival but it’s also been a change in him that has seen Barça’s form transformed. It seemed he was trying too hard to put his stamp on the team towards the end of last year; trying to hard to show his multimillionaire players who was boss.

Since January he has loosened the reigns – and in response his thoroughbred team have hit the front and will be difficult to stop.
