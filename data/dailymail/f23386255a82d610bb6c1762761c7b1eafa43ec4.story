A grandfather lost so much weight whilst being treated by the NHS, that staff failed to recognise him from a photograph his wife left on his bedside table.

Retired engineer John Thorpe, 88, shed five stone in just five weeks after being admitted to a care home and hospital following a fall in his back garden.

By the time he died following treatment at Royal Bolton Hospital in Bolton, Greater Manchester, the grandfather-of-four had developed pressure sores due to being bedbound and was said to look like a 'shadow of his former self.'

Tragedy: John and Nora Thorpe on their 40th wedding anniversary. Hospital staff were unable to recognise the retired engineer in this photo after he shed five stone in just five weeks following a fall in his back garden

Now after nearly a year of wrangling NHS bosses have apologised to Mr Thorpe’s family after admitting some of its work practises while he was being treated were 'inadequate and lacking.'

Mr Thorpe had been enjoying an active life regularly walking the dog and would love taking trips abroad with his wife Nora - hill-climbing in Austria, and enjoying the cultures of Germany, Spain and Portugal.

But in February last year he accidentally stumbled and fell as he was pottering in the garden of the home he shared with his wife in Great Lever, Bolton.

After treatment at Royal Bolton Hospital, Mr Thorpe was advised to undergo a six-week physiotherapy course at Darley Court, an intermediate care home run by the trust, because his damaged knee saw him struggling to get out of his armchair.

But within weeks he developed painful pressure sores and became bed-bound while he was treated by Trust staff. He was sent back to Royal Bolton Hospital to a complex care ward because he was unwell.

Grieving: Nora Thorpe, 86, holds a picture of her late husband John. The hospital has accepted there was inadequate
communication with Mr Thorpe and his family during his time in its care last year 

Nora, 86, said: 'I had brought in a photograph of us to sit by John’s bed to cheer him up. A member of staff was chatting to him and asked who was in the photo. John said "it’s me" and the man didn’t believe him.

'He looked so different because he’d lost so much weight. He wasn’t a person who liked having to rely on people, so it was frustrating to see him so helpless.

'He would just have to lie there and look about him. He was deteriorating and I could see in his eyes it was as though he didn’t have anything to live for.'

The couple’s son Gordon, 58, said the family were not kept informed about deterioration in his father’s condition and said notes and documents relating to his care were not completed properly.

Fall: Mr Thorpe when he was 58 and an Officer in the Bolton Sea Cadets

He said: 'When my father went in for treatment, he was mobile but he came out on a stretcher and was taken back to hospital with two pressure sores that went through to the bone. After that he never got out of bed again.

'I wish he hadn’t gone in for physiotherapy in the first place - maybe he would still be here today. He was still getting about, he was struggling a bit because of his knee but he was still getting around the house.

'They were obviously giving him the 
wrong diet because he had never suffered that in his life. When I saw 
him being lifted into the ambulance he looked just awful - they said it 
could be touch and go whether he’d make it through the night.

'We
were never kept in the know about the problems he was having - the lack
of paperwork and lack of communication between staff and relatives was
disgraceful.

'The complex care ward was a shambles and a joke. There was not enough staff to cover all the patients.

'Staff
put him on a liquid diet because he was unable to swallow because of 
dementia. But he hated the food - it was all mushed up and disgusting so
he didn’t eat it.

'They 
didn’t help him in any way, he would eat the bananas and yoghurts we 
would take in for him. He lost around five stones, he was so weak. But 
yet it was the mushed food or nothing.'

Eventually
a doctor told his family that no more could be done for Mr Thorpe’s 
sores because the septicaemia had gone so deep, it was down to the bone -
and the pensioner was discharged to go home. He died the following 
October.

Gordon said: 'I 
asked the doctor why on earth he developed the sores in the first place 
and he turned to me and said, "if you don’t like the care then why don’t
you pay to put him in a home."

'He
also said the NHS was in a shambles because "some people in this room 
may not be paying their taxes". We were shocked - he spoke to us like 
utter dirt.

'The fact is my
father wasn’t being monitored or anything because staff weren’t 
updating his notes properly. It was heart-breaking to see my dad suffer 
like that. We had our trust in the professionals, only for them to fail.

'The
NHS keep promising they will get things right, but they’re not. When 
mistakes are made in hospital, people’s lives are at risk.'

The
cash strapped hospital is at the centre of an investigation after it 
emerged it had 'lost' £3.8m in accounting bungles. This week the 
hospital’s director of finance resigned.

Sores: Mr Thorpe died following treatment at Royal 
Bolton Hospital in Bolton, Greater Manchester, where he
had developed pressure sores due to being bedbound and was said to look 
like a 'shadow of his former self'

Dee Sissons, Director of Patient Experience and Safety/Chief Nurse at Royal Bolton Hospital said: 'I fully accept that there was inadequate communication with Mr Thorpe and his family during his father’s time in our care last year and unacceptable delays in sending him reports into his subsequent complaints.

'Some patients have complex health conditions which mean they are particularly at risk of developing pressure sores.

'We use risk assessments, provide special pressure relieving mattresses and cushions and where needed turn patients frequently to minimise these risks.

'However, in some patients it can be very difficult to minimise all these risks and prevent pressure sores occurring.

'In the case of Mr Thorpe’s father we believe that overall appropriate care was given however the documentation to give evidence of what had been done was sometimes lacking.'
