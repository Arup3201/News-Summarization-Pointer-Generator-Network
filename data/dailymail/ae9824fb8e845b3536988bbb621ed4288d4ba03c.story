Football seasons can turn on small things. It will be interesting to see if Maurcio Pochettino's Tottenham team are good enough to make sure that the key moment of a rather frantic game at the KC Stadium  still appears significant several months down the line.

A goal down early in the second half on Humberside, Tottenham were seemingly drifting towards another defeat in the Barclays Premier League. 

To all intents and purposes, they were Liverpool dressed in white. Talented but aimless. Capable but low on confidence. It's a lousy mixture.

Football, though, can offer you opportunity when there seems to be none and Tottenham's came in the shape of the flailing right foot of the prone Hull midfielder Gaston Ramirez four minutes in to the second half.

Sent off by referee Craig Pawson on the advice of his linesman, the South American's foot did appear to make some kind of contact with Tottenham's Jan Vertonghen. 

Still, though, a red card seemed a little extreme as indeed was Pochettino's subsequent assertion that his team would still have won had Hull retained the full complement of players.

'Yes, I think we would have won anyway,' said Pochettino.

'We had a different attitude and mentality in the second half. We were better than Hull and deserved to win.'

Certainly the Tottenham manager deserves full marks for positive – if not wishful – thinking. His team had been wretched in the first half and probably should have trailed by more than an early goal from former Spurs player Jake Livermore.

Undoubtedly, the red card changed the game. Credit to Tottenham for taking full advantage of it. Hull, meanwhile, perhaps need to understand that losing a player doesn't necessarily need to be the equivalent of a football death sentence. 

They retreated far too much – both mentally and in terms of territory – once Ramirez went off and they perhaps need to reflect on that a little.

In the short-term, however, manager Steve Bruce will feel a little hard done by as he reflects on this game and indeed on a run in the league that now sees Hull with only one win since the opening day of the season.

'It was petulance and the letter of the law says it's violent conduct,' said Bruce.

'But the really top referees use common sense. I think it should have been a yellow.

'Vertonghen is a 6ft 3in centre half but he has gone down as if pole-axed.

'That can't be healthy for the Premier League. It is creeping in and it's disappointing.

'We are seeing incidents of players trying to get others sent off.'

Steve Bruce was understandably frustrated at losing this game, which he felt turned on the dismissal of Gaston Ramirez in the 48th minute. Referee Craig Pawson had to send Ramirez off, not because of the petulant reaction to a series of challenges the Uruguayan made, but because his assistant, the vastly experienced Peter Kirkup, advised him to.

Pawson had clearly missed the retaliatory flick out by Ramirez and the swing of an arm, neither of which was particularly violent or aggressive, so had to rely on Kirkup's opinion. The decision to dismiss was harsh on Ramirez given the context of how referees are approaching their task this season and given his clear frustration at the attention he was getting from Moussa Dembele, Ben Davies and Jan Vertonghen.

The incident clearly affected the players and Pawson himself, who was then tested with a series of incidents - the clearest of which should have resulted in an obvious second yellow card for Jake Livermore for a late, reckless challenge.

Bruce's disappointment was keen and reflective not just of the sending off but that Hull should have been two or three up by half-time.

Having been brave enough to make six changes to his team after defeat at Burnley, Bruce saw his team play positive, vibrant football in the opening half an hour and they were ahead in only the ninth minute as Livermore reacted first to a clearing header to advance and drive a low right-foot shot across goalkeeper Hugo Lloris and in to the corner. 

                               MINS PLD    KM    MILES 

Hull                                            103.3    64.2

Jake Livermore         90             11.0       6.9

Robbie Brady            87             10.3       6.4

Nikica Jelavic            90             10.2       6.4

Tottenham                                112.3     69.8

Christian Eriksen      90             12.1       7.5

Harry Kane               90             11.5       7.1

Erik Lamela              90             11.5        7.1

At this point, and for a good while longer, Tottenham were struggling. They were handy enough in the final third – they have some intelligent players – but poor when they didn't have possession and two opportunities that Hull created midway through the half were indicative of this.

First Hull's Robbie Brady was too alert for the Tottenham central defenders, bringing a superb low save from Lloris from 12 yards. Then, moments later, the visiting defence were on their heels again when Lloris pushed away Ramirez's cross shot and Hatem Ben Arfa scooped the rebound over the bar.

It looked an awful miss and Bruce subsequently claimed it had taken a deflection. Maybe that would explain it but, whatever the case, it was a pivotal moment.

In to the second half and, after the red card, Tottenham certainly were better. From that point on Hulll struggled for possession and conceded the equaliser when a Christian Eriksen free-kick struck the bar and young Harry Kane reacted well to sweep in the rebound.

With almost half an hour left, Hull suddenly looked in trouble. Certainly Tottenham could have scored again sooner as Ryan Mason saw a shot saved, Kane headed down and wide from close range, Roberto Soldado was similarly wasteful and Erik Lamela drove in to the penalty area with purpose only to shoot high and wide.

A winner did always look likely, though, and it came with a minute left as Eriksen received the ball from Aaron Lennon before finding the corner from the edge of the penalty area.

'This is a cruel league,' said Bruce afterwards.

In the circumstances, that was something of an understatement.
