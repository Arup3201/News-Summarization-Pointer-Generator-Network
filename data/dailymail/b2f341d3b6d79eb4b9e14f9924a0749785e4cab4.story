Liverpool's stars may have had a difficult week, but they looked focused and ready to put it behind them as they arrived at Anfield on Tuesday.

A thrashing at the hands of European champions Real Madrid last Wednesday was followed up with a dour draw at home to Hull City.

But Liverpool will be hopeful that they can get back to winning ways in the Capital One Cup against a Swansea side who have won just one of their last four games.

And the likes of Martin Skrtel and Jordan Henderson looked to have their game faces on as they arrived at Anfield ahead of Tuesday's game.

Brendan Rodgers, who managed his opposite number Garry Monk at Swansea when Monk was a player there, is likely to name a strong side for the game.

However it is still not clear whether Mario Balotelli, who missed his side's best chance on the weekend and has been widely criticised, will play.Â
