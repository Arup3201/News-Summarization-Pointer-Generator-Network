A gardener left fighting for his life after a neighbour battered him over the head with a hammer in a feud over a smokey bonfire has been told his attacker is out of jail and moving back in next door.

James Killian, 52, suffered horrific head injuries when 'vicious' James Sharrod, 74, burst through his garden fence wielding a lump hammer.

Grandfather Sharrod was jailed for 12 months for attacking Mr Killian in a fit of rage because smoke from his bonfire was drifting into his home.

But he has
 now been released from jail and is about to move back into his home - 
just 30 yards from where terrified Mr Killian and his wife live.

Mr Killian said: 'After what he did to me I think it's disgusting that this man can waltz back into the neighbourhood.

'We are in bits, my wife is so fearful of the day when he will be sharing a boundary again and be able to see him from our home.

'We've been told that it is his home and he's entitled to live there but what about how I feel?

'I'm stressed enough with frightening flashbacks and the long term medical problems I've suffered at the hands of this man.'

Location: Pensioner Sharrod is to return home to his static caravan (marked with an arrow), which is one of several on a site which borders the back of Mr Killian's three-bedroom detached property

Mr Killian, 53, was putting out the bonfire when Sharrod burst through his hedge and began attacking him with the hammer.

An eye-witness described Mr Killian's battered head and face as 'like something from a horror film.'The attack was halted by Mr Killian's wife who ran into the garden after hearing her husband's screams.

Mrs Killian told a court she feared her husband was being murdered when she saw Sharrod astride of her husband.

Injuries: Mr Killian suffered horrific injuries to his head following the attack last year

Keen gardener Mr Killian survived the attack but needed surgery to head and facial wounds.

Sharrod claimed he had hit his neighbour 'once or twice' with the hammer which he had found in his garden. The weapon was never recovered.

After Sharrod was found guilty at Swansea Crown Court Judge Paul Thomas described the hammer attack as 'wholly and entirely vicious and unjustified'.

Sharrod is expected to return to his mobile home in Parkmill, Swansea, one of several on a residential caravan site bordering the back of Mr Killian's three-bedroom detached property.

Father-of-two Mr Killian said: 'When he was locked up we hoped that would be the last we'd see of him.

'But we have been told by his landlord that he is returning soon - probably in July.

'But no one will tell us officially when Mr Sharrod will be back so we can't prepare ourselves.

'The Probation Service refused to tell me when he will return other than to say soon.'

A spokesman for the Probation Service said it could not comment on the case.
