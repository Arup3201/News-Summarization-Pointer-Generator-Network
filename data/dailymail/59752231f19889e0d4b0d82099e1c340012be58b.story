Cameroon became the third team to be eliminated from this summer's World Cup as they were well beaten by Croatia 4-0 in Manaus.

Ivica Olic gave Niko Kovc's men the lead after just ten minutes before Alex Song saw red after appearing to lash out at Mario Madzukic in an off the ball incident.

With ten men, Cameroon's task became more difficult as they went further behind to an impressive solo goal from Croatia wideman Ivan Perisic.

Frontman Mandzukic made sure of the victory with a brace late on.

The Indomitable Lions follow Australia and Spain through the exit door.

Host commentator

Cameroon are OUT of the World Cup after tonight's defeat.

With zero points from their opening two games, Cameroon can not progress from the group with Mexico and Brazil level on four points and Croatia now on three.

Croatia's clash with Mexico is now a winner-takes-all clash!

Ivan Rakitic is played in on the edge of the box and delicately scoops the ball over the onrushing Itandje in the Cameroon goal but the ball spins wide.

So unlukcy. Would have been a great goal!

Moukandjo gets the ball on the edge of the area and attempts to curl the ball into the top corner but scuffs it hopelessly wide.

Moments after that chance Assou-Ekotto appeared to headbutt Moukandjo as the two exchanged heated words.and squared up to each other.

Cameroon: Edgar Salli replaces Eric Choupo-Moting

Croatia: Ante Rebic comes on for Perisic

Mandzukic's scores possibly the easiest goal of his career to put Croatia four goals ahead against Cameroon.

Goalkeeper Charles Itandje could only parry Eduardo's low, curling shot and Mandzukic was on hand to tap home with the goal gaping.

Inter Milan's Mateo Kovacic has been introduced to the action.

Former Arsenal man Eduardo, currently with Ukranian giants Shakhtar Donetsk, comes on for Olic.

Mandzukic makes it three for Croatia with a powerful header from a corner.

Surely game over?

Cameroon set to be the third team to be eliminated from this summer's tournament following Australia and Spain's (!) exits earlier this evening.

Perisic's solo goal will have certainly excited Evertonians.

The Croatian is a target for the Toffees.

The Bayern Muncih frontman was through on goal but Nicolas N'Koulou does enough to put the striker off who shoots wide.

Mandzukic should have done better with that opportunity.

Ivan Perisic doubles Croatia's advantage!

The wideman received the ball just on the halfway line and raced towards goal unchallenged before slotting the ball into the far corner.

Great solo effort from Perisic!

The Cameroon wideman spent last season in the French second division having signed for Nancy from Monaco in 2011.

The 25-year-old is certainly quick on the counter and may have caught the eye of some potential suitors.

Aboubakar blazes over just before the referee blows for half-time.

Croatia lead and Cameroon are down to ten men. 

Can the African nation turn things around or will Niko Kovac's men make their numerical advantage count?

Alex Song - Silly, silly boy.

Cameroon midfielder Song is given his marching orders after appearing to hit out at Mario Mandzukic in an off the ball incident as the pair raced forward as Croatia broke.

The incident was right in front of the referee and there was only one outcome.

The former Arsenal man has really let himself down, there. (and his team-mates)

The Schalke defender went on a mazy, if quite fluky run, beat three players but took one touch too many and knocked the ball out of play.

Decent effort.

The QPR man, who spent last season winning the Europa League with Sevilla, received the ball on the edge of the area. The midfielder could have crossed first time but instead raced goalwards and saw his eventual square ball easily blocked.

The ball bounces into the box and Olic takes a swing of his left foot from a tight angle...

but the ball ends up in row Z.

Looks like the Croatia left-back felt it was time for a change...

The crowd waited for the net to bulge as Perisic's effort looked destined for the goal but Aurelien Chedjou somehow managed to whack it away for a Croatia throw.

Croatia take the lead through the evergreen Ivica Olic.

The Wolfsburg frontman had it laid on a plate to him courtesy of Ivan Perisic's tidy square ball and made no mistake in slotting the ball into the corner of the net.

22-year-old Aboubakar definitely watched France '98.

The Cameroon frontman has just shown off the old Ronaldo (the original, not Cristiano) stepover to beat his man. Tidy.

Vincent Aboubakar's powerful header is stopped on the line - wouldn't have counted anyway after the referee blew for a foul.

Croatia free-kick.

Benjamin Moukandjo hits the side-netting in the first minute.

Positive start from the Indomitable Lions.

Samuel Eto'o will not start for Cameroon.

The striker, who arrived at the World Cup with a right knee injury, played in the opening game defeat to Mexico but later admitted he had played through the pain barrier.

For Croatia, Luka Modric will start in the midfield and Mario Mandzukic will play up front after missing the 3-1 loss to Brazil through suspension.

Cameroon XI: Itandje, Mbia, Chedjou, N'Koulou, Assou-Ekotto, Song, Matip, Enoh, Choupo-Moting, Aboubakar, Moukandjo.

Cameroon subs: Feudjou, N'Djock, Djeugoue, Nounkeu, N'Guemo, Eto'o, Makoun, Bedimo, Webo, Fabrice, Salli, Nyom.

Croatia: Pletikosa, Srna, Corluka, Lovren, Pranjic, Modric, Rakitic, Perisic, Sammir, Olic, Mandzukic.

Croatia Subs: Zelenika, Subasic, Vrsaljko, Vukojevic, Jelavic, Schildenfeld, Brozovic, Mocinic, Rebic, Kovacic, Vida, Eduardo.

Both sides are on the lookout for their first victory of this summer's tournament after losing their opening games.

Croatia lost 3-1 to Brazil in the World Cup opener while Cameroon were beaten by Mexico 1-0.

Following Brazil's stalemate with Mexico yesterday, defeat for either side will spell elimination.
