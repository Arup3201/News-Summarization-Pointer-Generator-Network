The reputation of the City of London was dealt another blow last night after a probe was launched into the deal which kept Barclays afloat at the peak of the financial crisis.

The beleaguered bank – which is still without a chief executive following the exit of disgraced boss Bob Diamond – revealed that the Serious Fraud Office is investigating a cash injection by Qatar.

It follows a summer of shame for Britain’s leading banks including Barclays, HSBC, Standard Chartered and taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland.

Scrutinised: Funds raised by Barclays in 2008 in order to save the bank is now under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office

Barclays is one of a number of global banks under investigation over the rigging of the crucial Libor interest rate which sets borrowing costs around the world.

The rate fixing scandal led to resignation of former chief executive Bob Diamond, chairman Marcus Agius and chief operating officer Jerry del Missier.

It also cost the bank £290m in fines and it faces lawsuits from investors across the globe which could run into the billions.

Barclays is now under fire over a contentious fundraising in 2008 when the bank secured £4.5bn from the Qatar. Later that year, it raised another £7.1bn from Qatar, Abu Dhabi and other shareholders.

Troubled times: The investigation is another hard blow to London's financial centre in the City of London

At the time, it was feared that Barclays would be the next bank to fall following the government rescues of Northern Rock, RBS and Lloyds Banking Group, owner of crippled HBOS.

‘Barclays confirms that the Serious Fraud Office has commenced an investigation into payments under certain commercial agreements between Barclays and Qatar Holding,’ the bank said in a statement last night.

No leader: Barclays has yet to replace Bob Diamond as chief executive

The SFO is understood to be looking at whether disclosure of payments to advisers was sufficient when it raised the money.

It is yet another blow to London as a pre-eminent financial centre as American regulators pore over reports into HSBC over money laundering in the Middle East and Mexico.

Standard Chartered, having settled to the tune of £217m with regulators in New York over money laundering in Iran, still faces investigations by other American authorities.

Royal Bank of Scotland, like Barclays, is also in the firing line over its involvement in the Libor-fixing scandal which is thought to involve more than a dozen global banks.

Britsih bankers have sought to portray the clampdown by American regulators as a form of financial protectionism.

However, the disclosure the Barclays is under investigation in the UK for its fund raising activities shows that there are serious concerns about the culture of British banks on both sides of Atlantic.

Boss: Antony Jenkins, who has been on the executive committee since 2009, will be paid £1.1 million a year in the role

Under-fire banking giant Barclays today named its retail and business banking boss Antony Jenkins as chief executive.

Mr Jenkins takes on the post with immediate effect and succeeds former chief executive Bob Diamond, who quit in the wake of its interbank rate rigging scandal.

Mr Jenkins, who has been on the executive committee since 2009, will be paid £1.1 million a year in the role, with a package including potential annual bonuses of up to 250 per cent of salary and long term incentive shares worth a possible £4.4 million each year.

He will be joined at the top in November by incoming chairman Sir David Walker, who takes over from Marcus Agius, who announced his intention to resign after the Libor rigging furore.

Their appointments end a period of uncertainty over the group's leadership at a crucial time for the bank.

Oxford University graduate Mr Jenkins, who started his career at the bank before moving to Citi in 1989, said he would seek to repair the bank's tarnished image as a top priority.

He said: 'We have made serious mistakes in recent years and clearly failed to keep pace with our stakeholders' expectations.'

The bank has been searching for a new chief executive since Mr Diamond resigned in early July amid the furore following its £290 million settlement with UK and US authorities for attempting to manipulate the Libor rate at the height of the financial crisis.
