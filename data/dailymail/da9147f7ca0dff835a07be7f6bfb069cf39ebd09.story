A schizophrenic woman warned how she had already killed her own mother as she demanded to be admitted to hospital before she stabbed someone else, the Old Bailey heard today.

Nicola Edgington, who knifed her mother to death eight years ago, then asked hospital staff whether it would take her killing someone else before she would be seen after a three and a half hour wait to see a specialist psychiatric team.

She then walked out of the hospital and attacked a 24-year-old woman before allegedly killing 58-year-old Sally Hodkin with a butcher's knife in Bexleyheath, southeast London.

Defendant: Diagnosed schizophrenic Nicola Edgington, 32, left, is accused of stabbing Sally Hodkin, 58, pictured right, to death with a 12-inch meat cleaver in Bexleyheath last year and the attempted murder of Kerry Clark, 22

Danger to the public: Edgington turned up at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital at 4.30am in October last year demanding to be admitted before she hurt someone. After waiting three and a half hours to see psychiatric specialists, she then asked staff if she would have to kill someone else to be seen before walking out

Edgington, a diagnosed schizophrenic, had spent just three years in a secure hospital after admitting the manslaughter of her mother Marion, who she stabbed to death in November 2005.

The following year she was given an indefinite hospital order and treated as an inpatient before being released in 2009.

She was under the care of the nearby Bracton Centre and was being reviewed regularly by a psychiatrist and nurse while living at a housing association flat in Greenwich.

The 32-year-old had previously been 
diagnosed with schizophrenia but had stopped taking her medication at 
the time of the two attacks on 10 October 2011.

Attack: The Meat Market in Bexleyheath where Edgington is alleged to have taken the knife

Edgington turned up at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich at 4.29am and complained of hearing voices and said she had not slept for six weeks.

She was referred to the specialist psychiatric team at Oxleas House and told to wait in Accident and Emergency.

Manslaughter: Nicola Edgington stabbed her mother Marion, pictured, to death in 2005

Receptionist Sylvia Rogers told the court: 'She started to get agitated and came up to the desk.

'She was asking how long it was going to take because she didn't want to be there. She was getting very agitated.

'She was saying there was no reason for her to be there and not in Oxleas.'

Mrs Rogers said she asked the patient to sit down and wait but Edgington replied: 'Is it going to take me to kill someone as I did before for me to get seen?'

While she was waiting to be transferred Edgington made a series of 999 calls warning she was dangerous and might harm someone.

Later that morning she was taken to the Oxleas Unit at around 7.05am but announced: 'I'm going to call my care coordinator' and left the building.

Edgington took a series of buses to Bexleyheath where she bought a knife and attacked Kerry Clark, 24.

Miss Clark managed to disarm her but Edgington went into a butcher's shop where she stole a second 12-inch knife.

She then attacked Mrs Hodkin - a married grandmother who worked for law firm Cunningham Blake in nearby Blackheath as an accounts manager - as she made her way to the office.

Edgington admits carrying out the attacks but claims she did not intend to kill Miss Clark and her responsibility for the death of Mrs Hodkin is diminished by her mental state.

Edgington, of Flavell Mews, Greenwich, southeast London, denies murder and attempted murder.

The trial continues.
