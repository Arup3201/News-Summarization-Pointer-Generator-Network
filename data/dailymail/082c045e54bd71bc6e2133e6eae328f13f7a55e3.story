Despite the excitement surrounding the new iPhone5, many users will be left frustrated as it includes a controversial new 'docking connector' which will render thousands of Apple accessories obsolete.

With the new model, Apple is ditching the docking port connector it's used for iPods, iPhones and iPads for nearly a decade in favor of a smaller, narrower one.

The newer, slimline port means that 
thousands of current Apple accessories will need a potentially clunky 
adapter to work with the 'iPhone 5' - or become unusable.

According to the website Gizmodo, the new
'Lightning to 30-pin' adapter will cost about £18 while a 0.2m cable 
version of the adapter will cost £24.

somewhat of a disconnect for previous users, the new port is faster and
can be plugged in either way up

Bye bye 4S, hello 5: Phil Schiller, Apple's 
senior vice president of worldwide marketing, shows off the iPhone 5 for
the first time

There will be adapters 
available so that the new phone will be able to connect to sound docks 
and other accessories designed for the old phones.

Speaking at today's launch, Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said: '

‘The iPhone from its start used the 30 pin connector, and it has served us well. A lot has changed and it is time for the connector to evolve - and our new connector is called Lightning.’

Many fans were
left angry last month when images allegedly showing the iPhone 5's new design 
leaked out, showing the traditional 30-pin dock connector - used for 
charging, syncing files and pumping audio to hi-fis - had been 
re-designed into a smaller shape.

Change: This picture is believed to show a prototype case for the new iPhone, with its new connector design which is set to make every existing accessory completely obsolete

The new port looks similar to micro 
USB, the standard supported by all other phone manufacturers - however 
it is very unlikely that Apple will support this standard, despite moves
by the EU to get all phone companies to rally around one type of cable.

Apple's version has a triangle-shaped wedge at one end, which should stop users plugging in the cable the wrong way round.

Mac
fans may spot a superficial similarity to a Firewire port, which is 
used to transfer raw video footage and larger files at high speed.

Popular: But iPhone users could found themselves seriously out of pocket if they want to upgrade their device

Useless: The $850 Bang & Olufsen BeoSound 8 is designed to work with the current iPhone's design

The
'nano-SIM' slot, containing the SIM card which connects a phone to the 
carrier network, has also been redesigned to be thinner, although this 
will be unlikely to cause much disruption to users as networks will 
provide replacements SIMs if necessary.

There
are also rumours, reported on iMore, that the iPad 3, which was 
released in the Spring, will get a slight tweak this Autumn to brink the
dock connector in-line with the rest of the range.
