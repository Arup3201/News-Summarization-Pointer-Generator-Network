A corporate lawyer today revealed the moment she felt ‘pure terror’ when she discovered a fox licking her sleeping six-year-old daughter’s face after it sneaked into their London home.

Jo Williams said she did a double take when she saw the urban scavenger on top of her daughter Ava’s bed on the fourth floor of the family’s £1.5 million house in Clapham, south London.

Luckily, little Ava was not harmed after Ms Williams chased the fox around the house for 90 minutes before it escaped out a roof window.

Intruder: This fox was found licking a six-year-old girl's face as she slept in her bed in south London before it was chased out by the girl's mother

Ms Williams, 40, was working in her office next to Ava’s bedroom when she heard a loud thud. She rushed into the room to find a fox licking around the girl’s chin and mouth as she slept.

She said the fox may have been attracted by a fruit-flavoured moisturising cream applied to treat Ava’s dry skin.

Ms Williams chased it into a spare room before calling on a neighbour to help get the fox out of the house because her husband was out.

Mother-of-two Ms Williams said: ‘I went to check on her and saw this fox on top of her with its tail all puffed out, looking really scary.

‘It looked at me then took another lick of Ava’s chin. I had a few seconds of pure terror where I just froze to the spot.

‘I rushed to pick Ava up and took her out the room, but it took another hour-and-a-half before I could get the fox out. It had messed all over the room. It was revolting.’

In 2010, nine-month-old twin girls Lola and Isabella Koupparis suffered horrific injuries when they were mauled by a fox as they slept in their cots at their family home in Hackney, east London after the patio doors were left open.

Incredibly this time, little Ava slept through the latest drama and was not injured.

Her mother believes the fox got in through the back door of the house in a leafy suburban street, near Clapham Common in south London, which had been propped open as it was a balmy evening at around 8pm on Tuesday September 3.

She said: ‘I won’t be leaving it open again.’

Ms Williams called on people to stop feeding foxes as she believes attracts them into urban areas.

She said: ‘A lot of people feed the foxes, but they forget they are vermin. 

‘I think if people stopped feeding them there would be a lot less around and things like this wouldn’t happen.

‘You hear about the fox attacks on children and after the shock and the adrenaline you realise what a lucky escape we had.

‘When I walked in I just did this cartoon double take, I was like “what is this?” I was just so shocked. After I realised the fox had not mauled my child, the adrenaline just kicked in. But afterwards, of course I was terrified - you just keep thinking what could have happened.

‘My little girl does not know anything about it. She was asleep the whole time. After it happened I tried to wake her, but she was still in that first stage of sleep. I’m now glad she doesn’t know.

Defence mechanism: Foxes are not naturally aggressive but do attack if they feel threatened (file photo)

‘Thankfully there have been no 
ill-effects, but who knows what sort of diseases foxes carry? I’m just 
so relieved it didn’t savage her.’

A spokesman for The Mammal Society said although foxes are not naturally aggressive they will attack when they feel threatened.

She
said: ‘In this case the fox could indeed have been attracted by the 
girl’s face cream, but he could have been licking her face in the same 
way a dog would and had no intention to attack her.

‘When
a fox attacks it is purely a last resort defence mechanism. It’s out of
fear, not out of aggression, usually if they are approached by humans 
or can’t find their way out of somewhere.

‘But foxes are becoming more habituated to human environments largely due to the abundance of food in urban areas.

‘People can unintentionally encourage foxes by leaving food out in the garden for other animals. Some people leave food scraps or cat food out for hedgehogs, for example. And foxes eat anything so they’ll go for it.

‘To minimise the chance of a fox getting in the house people should make sure their bins are well maintained and try not to tame them as they need to still be scared of you. If they lose that fear they become more bold and that’s potentially when they get into houses.’

While Ava was lucky to be left untouched by the fox, other children have been less fortunate.

Earlier this year, five-week-old baby Denny Dolan was mauled by a fox in his family living room in south London earlier this year.

His mother Hayley Crawley wrestled with the fox and fought it off but her son was left soaked in blood and had gashes to his face and a black eye where the fox hit him against the door frame.

Denny had to have his finger reattached 
in surgery and needed stitches to his cheek, as well as treatment for 
injuries to his face and head.

Lola and her twin sister Isabella Koupparis fell victim to the fox in 2010 when it crept in through patio doors left open in the heat.

Isabella, who was the more badly hurt of the pair with ‘life changing’ injuries to her arms. Their mother, Pauline, described the attack as ‘looking like something from a horror movie’.

In January this year, terrified jogger Clare Laudy, 17, fought off a fox that sank its teeth into her leg after it leapt out of the darkness and bit her as she ran in Epsom, Surrey.

Brave pet owner Vicky Reeves was forced to wrestle her two-year-old Chihuahua Lexi from the jaws of a fox in her back garden in Laindon, Essex in 2012.

The 29-year-old heard screams and ran out to find the fox had jumped over the fence and was attacking Lexi - leaving the dog with severe bite wounds to her neck.

There are an estimated 33,000 urban foxes in the UK.
