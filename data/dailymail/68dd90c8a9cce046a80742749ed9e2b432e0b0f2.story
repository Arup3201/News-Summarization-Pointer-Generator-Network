A clubber headbutted a man, pushed a woman to the floor and racially abused a doorman – after being taunted about being ginger.

Leon Lane, from, Aberaeron in Wales, said he was ‘targeted’ by a group of revellers in a nightclub because of his hair colour – and then struggled to control his aggression.

Witnesses saw the drunk 20-year-old assault a man and push a woman over before a doorman at Aberystwyth’s Pier Pressure nightclub intervened to try and calm him down.

A court heard how he then hurled racial abuse at another doorman before police were called out to the incident, in the early hours of August 10.

Lane admitted in court to using threatening behaviour – but insisted he was not racially prejudiced, claiming he had become angry after being taunted about his red hair earlier that night.

He said he did not think it was fair that he could be abused and that people ‘don’t like it when something is said back to them’.

Prosecutor Vaughan Pritchard Jones said police attended the scene amid reports Lane was acting aggressively.

But the doorman involved had not wanted to make a complaint about the racial abuse, he added.

Mr Pritchard Jones said: ‘This young man was under the influence of alcohol and trying to pick a fight with anyone who would fight him.’

Aberystwyth Magistrates' Court heard that the offence had also breached a conditional discharge imposed in a London court after Lane was convicted of being drunk and disorderly and assaulting a police officer.

Lane, who represented himself, said he was angry that he had been ‘targeted’ by a group because of his hair colour.

He said: ‘It angers me that people think that it’s okay to say something like that to me, but don’t like it when something is said back to them.’

Lane told magistrates that his behaviour had been unacceptable and that he hoped to be able to get help to control his anger.

He was sentenced to a six-month community order with a supervision requirement. He was also fined £40 and will pay costs totalling £145.

The previous conditional discharge was revoked.
