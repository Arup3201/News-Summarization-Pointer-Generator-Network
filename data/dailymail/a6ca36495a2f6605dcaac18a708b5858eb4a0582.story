The mysterious 'Shirtless FBI Agent' who began the investigation that led to the resignation of David Petraeus has been revealed.

Frederick W. Humphries, has been accused of sending Tampa socialite Jill Kelley sexual photos of himself after she contacted him for help about threatening emails she had received from David Petraeus' biographer-turned-mistress Paula Broadwell.

But today the 47-year-old insisted the photograph was sent as a 'joke' and described it as him 'posing with a couple of dummies.'

FBI Special Agent Fred Humphries has been identified as the 'Shirtless FBI Agent' who helped begin the investigation that brought down David Petraeus

Veteran FBI agent Frederick Humphries is recognised as a dilligent and passionate officer who helped to thwart numerous terror threats to the United States

Refuting media suggestions that the 
picture was sent because he had become enamoured with the attractive 
Florida socialite, the decorated FBI agent said that the photo was sent 
years ago.

According to
 the general counsel for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers 
Association who have spoken to Humphries, the FBI counter terrorism 
agent only passed on the information Kelley provided him with and played
 no part in the subsequent investigation.

Lawrence Berger told the New York Times that Humphries, who played a key role in stopping a terrorist attack aimed at blowing up Los
 Angeles International Airport  in 1999 and his wife had been 'social friends with Ms. Kelley and her husband prior to the day she referred the matter to him.'

'They always socialized and corresponded.'

Berger
 denied any suggestion that Humphries sent inappropriate shirtless 
pictures to Kelley during the course of the investigation which has now 
engulfed the intelligence community in Washington.

'That picture was sent years before 
Kelley contacted him about this, and it was sent as part of a larger 
context of what I would call social relations in which the families 
would exchange numerous photos of each other,' said Berger.

Claiming that the picture was sent as
 a 'joke', Berger said that Humphries was 'posing with a couple of 
dummies' at the time of the photograph and that it was not sexual in 
nature.

However, those with knowledge of the 
investigation that Humphries sparked said that he was given a 
dressing down by his superiors for trying to push the complaint forward.

In fact, according to the New York 
Times, Humphries believed that the case was purposefully being 
stalled for political reasons.

So much so, that in October, Humphries contacted Representative Dave Recihert, a Republican from 
Washington State, where Humphries had worked before to ask for his help - purposefully going over his bosses heads.

Mr. Reichert directed him to House 
majority leader, Eric Cantor who eventually passed the message onto the 
FBI director, Robert S. Mueller.

According to Wired Magazine,
 Cantor and his staff personally met with Humphries in October but were 
unable to act on the information he was giving them because they doubted
 his credibility.

They 
also had no idea that FBI were investigating David Petraeus in the first
 place and after conferring they decided to contact FBI Director Robert 
Mueller on October 31st.

One
 week later, on November 6th, Election Day, Mueller went to James 
Clapper the director of national intelligence and Petraeus' immediate 
superior - who urged him to resign his position as head of the CIA.

In
 fact, the House Judiciary Committee has written to Mueller to ask why 
it took him a week to come forward with the information that Humphries 
had given him.

This information puts severe doubt 
over Humphries assertion that he took no active interest in the case
 that has caused the resignation of the CIA chief David Petraeus and 
could cause the downfall of General John Allen, who commands U.S. troops
 in Afghanistan.

'Fred is a passionate kind of guy,' 
said one former colleague. 'He’s kind of an obsessive type. If he locked
 his teeth onto something, he’d be a bulldog.'

Humphries has since been reassigned and his status is being reviewed by the FBI.

Jon Adler, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association,
 defended Humphries as a experienced professional. 'From my view issues 
of national security have unfortunately been reduced to a bad episode of
 'Real Housewives,' he said to the Wall Street Journal.

'The photos should not undermine the fact
 that the agent responded in a timely way and appropriately, nor do they
 reflect any amorous relationship,' he said.

It was Humphries who passed on 
Jill Kelley's complaint about disturbing emails she had received to his 
superiors in the FBI Tampa field office.

The investigation tracked down the 
emails to Paula Broadwell and subsequently discovered the extramarital 
affair between 60-year-old Petraeus and the married mother-of-two.

The inquiry also brought in General 
John Allen after the FBI uncovered evidence that he had sent 
'inappropriate communication' to Kelley.

Humphries
 grew up in Steilacoom, Washington, attended high school in Canada and 
rose to become a captain in military intelligence in the U.S. Army.

Studying
 criminology at the University of Tampa, Humphries joined the FBI and in
 1999 he was involved in the investigation which foiled Ahmed Rassam the
 'Millennium Bomber' who planned to attack Los Angeles International 
Airport.

Two years ago the passionate officer was
 attacked outside of MAcDill Air Force Base in Tampa by a knife wielding
 man, who Humphries fatally shot.

In the subsequent inquiry into the 
shooting, Humphries was determined to have used appropriate force in 
taking down the man who was reported to be unhinged.

The special agent was also involved in the investigation of former University of South Florida student Youssef Megahed.

Megahed
 was arrested in August 2007 along with USF student Ahmed Mohamed in 
South Carolina while the pair were transported explosive PVC pipes 
filled with potassium nitrate.

Megahed was charged with illegal transportation of explosive materials and possession of a destructive device. Neither man was convicted on those charges, but Mohamed received a 15-year sentence after an FBI investigation found he posted an Internet video showing how to make a toy car's remote control into a detonator.

However, after his April 2009 acquital, Megahed was arrested again for a deportation hearing - after authorities deemed his continuation in the United States too dangerous to continue.

'We felt that Mr. Megahed was willingly providing assistance to Mr. Mohamed, who is a self-professed terrorist,' Humphries said at the time to The Tampa Bay Times.

However, the attempt to deport the former student failed and Megahed remains in the country.

Lawrence Berger, a lawyer for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers 
Association, told New York Magazine that Humphries passed the 
information on to supervisors but was not assigned to the case.

'No one tries to become a whistle-blower,' said Lawrence Berger.

'Consistent with FBI policy, he referred it to the proper component.'

This comes as it was revealed that the harassing emails sent by Paula Broadwell, the biographer-turned-mistress of David Petraeus, to her perceived love rival, Florida socialite Jill Kelley, contained confidential information about the CIA boss's movements

After Kelley contacted the FBI, agents launched a massive in-depth investigation into who was sending the emails because they shared this detailed information that was not publicly available.

The catty emails, which told Kelley to 'back off' from Petraeus, were sent to Kelley from several fake email addresses. In order to find who had confidential information about Petraeus' whereabouts, the FBI obtained an administrative subpoena, and traced them back to Broadwell.

In the course of the investigation, they also unearthed emails indicating the affair between Broadwell and Petraeus, leading to his resignation on Friday.

The new details of what uncovered Petraeus' months-long relationship with his biographer come as the FBI continue to search military documents Broadwell admitted to stashing in her home.

Security officials have revealed she had 'substantial' classified information on her computer which should have been stored more securely.

The computer was taken from Broadwell's Charlotte, North Carolina home on Monday night after she admitted to FBI investigators that she had taken classified military documents, a source told ABC.

President Obama said on Wednesday there was no indication so far that any classified documents had been found but said he will not prejudge the investigation results.

Officials continue to investigate exactly how Broadwell acquired the files, but as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Military Reserve, she had security clearance to review the documents.

The government had demanded she return the documents and organised the visit to her home. Prosecutors are now deciding whether to charge her with a crime.
