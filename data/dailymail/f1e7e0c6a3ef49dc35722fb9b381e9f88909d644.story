David Moyes admits there is no guarantee Wayne Rooney will sign a new contract at Old Trafford if Manchester United fail to qualify for the Champions League this season.

Rooney, who will miss Saturday's FA Cup third-round tie at home to Swansea with a groin injury, will enter the final year of his £250,000-a-week deal in the summer.

United are anxious to open negotiations over a new one but it is thought the 28-year-old wants to wait until after the World Cup before assessing his future and the club's progress.

United's hopes of retaining the Barclays Premier League title suffered another blow on New Year's Day when they slipped to seventh in the table after a defeat by Tottenham.

It raised fears that Rooney, subject of a £30million bid from Chelsea last summer, could leave if United cannot qualify for the Champions League.

Moyes said on Friday: 'We would have to wait and see what happened in that situation.'

Asked if the England striker is happy at United, Moyes said: 'I think if you look at his performances he's certainly playing at his best.'

Uncertain: The England international is unwilling to decide his future until after the World Cup

Rooney's groin injury has kept him out of two of United's last five games, although Moyes says he has 'a chance' of returning for the Capital One Cup semi-final against Sunderland on Tuesday.

Moyes said Ashley Young also has a shoulder injury as a result of a challenge from Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris on Wednesday.

Referee Howard Webb took no action, a decision described as 'scandalous' by Moyes, who thought the challenge was worthy of a penalty and red card for Lloris.
