Soaked in its own blood this swan could easily be mistaken for a tropically pink flamingo.

The birds normally pristine white feathers were turned  rose after a suspected crash landing left it saturated in its own blood.

The stricken bird, named Pinky by rescuers, was discovered suffering from several deep cuts, including a slashed vein, stumbling in field near Wartling, East Sussex.

Rescuers, who nicknamed the bird Pinkie, applied trauma gauze to the birds lower beak to help stop the bleeding 

Rescuer Trevor Weeks from East Sussex Wildlife Rescue and Ambulance Service (WRAS) had to swim across three dykes in order to catch the swan which was then bedded down in a wildlife rescue ambulance and given first aid. 

Mr Weeks said: 'We had to apply a trauma gauze to the lower beak to help stop the bleeding, which had to be taped in place.

'After seeking advice from the Swan Sanctuaries veterinary team we decided to send the swan up to their specialist for assessment.

'But we hope the swan will be suitable for returning to the area once fit and well.'

Wildlife rescue volunteer Chris Riddington added: 'I've never seen anything quite like it.

'The swan was completely red. There were no white feathers at all, just blood everywhere.'

 Rescuers believe that the bird may have come into contact with a power line during a crash landing.

The cuts were centred around the swan's mouth and the blood was believed to have been spread as it preened itself.
