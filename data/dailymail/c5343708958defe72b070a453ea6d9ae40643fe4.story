A wronged wife threatened to blow up her own husband's family during a vigilante hate campaign - after she found out he had led a double life as a paedophile.

Stephanie Simcock, 25, was so furious at learning the dark secret of ex-trainee priest Richard Simcock, she left a string of chilling phone and text messages for his mother.

One said: 'I will bomb your house down, just you wait. I am going to kill you and burn your house down. I am going to kill you all.'

Another said: 'I have got a bomb. I am going to blow you in pieces.' A third said: 'Don't leave your house after 9pm. That's the best time to kill you.'

The hate campaign began after Simcock, 28, was jailed for 10 years in April 2013 and branded a 'real risk to children' after he was convicted of sexually abusing two girls committed several years before he met his wife.

At the time it was claimed Stephanie who had a child with Simcock in 2010 was 'standing by her man.'

But police in Burnley, Lancs were called in last February by his Simcock's mother Kim, 54, after complaints Stephanie had made threats to her in 10 text messages, five voicemails and two landline messages, as well as on Facebook.

She also made about 60 silent phone calls to the police from her mobile in one day.

When arrested Stephanie told police she blamed her mother-in-law for not telling her about her son

Richard was arrested in October 2011 after the two victims he abused many years earlier complained to police

Stephanie's lawyer argued she had a 'lot of residual anger' towards her husband and his family

Stephanie, from Rawtenstall was jailed for 12 weeks after she admitted sending offensive or menacing messages. Richard Simcock, 28, was jailed last April for 10 years and branded a 'real risk to children'

When arrested Stephanie told police she 
blamed Mrs Simcock for not telling her about her son. and added: 'I 
can't get to him because he's in prison. I can get to his family.'

At Burnley magistrates court, Stephanie, from Rawtenstall was jailed for 12 weeks after she admitted sending offensive or menacing messages.

The court heard how her husband had been jailed in April last year for historic sex attacks committed before Simcock met Stephanie.

During the attacks several years ago, he repeatedly tried to rape one frightened victim and committed indecent acts on the other - but neither victim went to police.

Simcock later met and married Stephanie in 2008 and two years later the couple had a baby together.

He was then arrested in October 2011 and charged in March 2012 after the two victims he abused many years earlier complained to police.

Simcock later claimed he had struck when he was 'very young and stupid' but had now changed and had since studied to become a Mormon Priest.

He admitted three charges of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one allegation of sexual activity with a child.

Stephanie's threats were made in 10 text messages, five voicemails and two landline messages, as well as on Facebook

But prosecutor Andrew Robinson told the 
magistrates court on Wednesday that threats were made by Stephanie in 10
 text messages, five voicemails and two landline messages, as well as on
 Facebook.

Stephanie texted Kim, telling her: 'I will bomb your house down, just you wait. I am going to kill you and burn your house down. I am going to kill you all.'

Mr Robinson said Stephanie also left abusive voicemail messages referring to her disgraced husband and all five were over one evening.

She then left messages on Kim's landline, telling her : ' I have got a bomb. I am going to blow you in pieces.'

Two days later, on February 27, she posted a Facebook message threatening violence when she next saw her mother-in-law and told her: 'I will stamp on your face.' Kim was said to be extremely concerned by her daughter-in-law's behaviour.

The prosecutor said in one 999 call to the police, Stephanie referred to the offences committed by her husband and made death threats. The others were silent.

Permanent reminder: Richard's name is tattooed on Stephanie's arm, and now she wants to get a divorce

In mitigation defence lawyer Keith Rennison said Stephanie had a 'lot of residual anger' towards her husband and his family.

Mr Rennison added: 'She had been in a relationship with him for four years, had a child with him and didn't know about the historical offences. She wants to get a divorce, so she would no longer have his name and move on.

'She feels that will be a cut-off point and the end of it for her and hopefully that end is in sight.'

Mr Rennison added Simcock had reflected and was now in touch with the mental health team to get counselling. He added: ' Clearly that needed to happen. She plans to use the rest of the time positively whilst in custody.'
