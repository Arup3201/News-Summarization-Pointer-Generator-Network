A British skier plunged hundreds of his feet to his death while trying to reach shelter on Mont Blanc via an icy ridge blasted by freezing winds, it emerged today.

The man, who has not been named, found himself trapped on the Aiguille du Midi peak, which is usually reached by the highest cable car in the world.

It had stopped working on Saturday night, so the man and a companion tried to find shelter on the mountain, which rises to 12,460 ft (3,842 metres) in altitude above the resort of Chamonix.

But as they clambered across a ridge to reach the cable station the skier lost his footing and plunged to his death.

The second skier survived, and was able to alert the emergency services by mobile phone.

He said they had set off earlier in the day to ski the Vallee Blanche, a popular itinerary along the glacial valley at the heart of the Mont Blanc range, but they were forced to change their plans because of the deteriorating weather.

He plummeted to his death at around 9pm following a long climb back up towards the ski lift. Mountain rescue teams have yet to recover his body.

Captain Patrice Ribes, of the Chamonix mountain rescue force, said the skier could have fallen up to 1,000 metres.

He said the two men - who met on the internet to arrange the excursion - would have faced driving winds of up to 100km per hour and heavy snow as they clambered back up the mountain last night.

'They set off earlier in the day together but then the weather turned bad,' Cpt Ribes said.

'There was a storm and so they decided to turn around and walk back to the cable car.

'They left their skies on the mountain and started to climb. The British man fell from the north face at around 9pm.

'He would have been exhausted from the climb. The winds were very high and the visibility poor.

'We do not know exactly how he fell. We have not found his body.'

The man was caught out as he descended the Vallee Blanche, a popular itinerary along the glacial valley at the heart of the Mont Blanc range

A number of climbers and skiers were caught out by high winds last week. On Saturday rescuers found a 21-year-old Frenchwoman who disappeared last Tuesday, suffering from hypothermia in the Mont Blanc range.

The Vallee Blanche route starts at the top of the Aiguille du Midi, at an altitude of around 3,800 metres.

One of the most dangerous points on the descent comes near the summit where the ground drops away several hundred metres from a narrow ridge.

According to local reports, the two skiers were attempting to cross this ridge when the British man fell to his death.

His companion made it back to the cable car safely.

Cpt Ribes said the Vallee Blanche was a popular route for competent skiers.

But he said winds at high altitude could reach speeds which made conditions dangerous for skiing.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in France and we stand ready to provide consular assistance.'
