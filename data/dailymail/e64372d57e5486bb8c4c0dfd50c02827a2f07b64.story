A celebrity psychic has sacked her husband and son-in-law from their roles in her management team after they were filmed threatening and hurling homophobic abuse at a sceptic who was handing out leaflets outside her shows.

Sally Morgan's husband, John Morgan, and son-in-law, Daren Wiltshear, were caught on camera by Mark Tilbrook as he stood outside a London theatre distributing leaflets that questioned whether psychics really could speak to the dead.

Mr Morgan was shown approaching Mr Tilbrook, 30, and threatening him with violence if he did not leave, saying: 'I'm gonna knock you out sooner or later...

'So f*** off before I do you.'

Last night Mrs Morgan, 63, who styles herself as 'Britain's best-loved psychic' and who gave readings to the late Princess Diana, announced she had sacked her two family members after seeing the footage.

She gave the news in a statement on her website, saying Mr Morgan and Mr Wiltshear will 'have nothing more to do with my business', and adding: 'Right now I honestly have no idea what is going to happen to my marriage.'

The video, which has just been released to coincide with October being 'Psychic Awareness Month', was filmed outside the Shaw Theatre in north London in April this year, shortly before Mrs Morgan gave one of her 'Psychic Sally: On The Road' shows. 

Mr Tilbrook, who was handing out leaflets entitled 'Look After Yourself' to audience members attending in the hope the psychic might contact dead relatives, said he had a video camera because Mr Morgan had been 'threatening and abusive' at the two previous shows he had leafleted.

The footage shows the psychic's husband coming up to him and telling him he was taking legal action against Mr Tilbrook. 

When Mr Tilbrook refused to leave, saying he was doing nothing wrong, Mr Morgan launched into a tirade of abuse, saying: 'I'm gonna knock you out one day because you are a nuisance...

The tape, which was uploaded to YouTube, began showing Mr Morgan telling Mr Tilbrook he was suing him

But the encounter quickly soured, with the psychic's husband threatening Mr Tilbrook with physical violence

'One day you're gonna be lifted and you'll disappear somewhere.'

He went on: 'You're a prat and I'm losing my temper, because I'm gonna knock you out sooner or later.

'So f*** off before I do you.'

He is seen continuing in this vein, becoming increasingly agitated despite Mr Tilbrook's refusal to fight back, saying: 'I'm gonna hit you in a minute.  I'm gonna knock you out.'

At this point, Sally Morgan's son-in-law, then tour manager, Mr Wiltshear, approached and added: 'I've seen him do it and you really don't want him to do it.'

Mr Morgan, who also threatened to 'flatten' Mr Tilbrook, hurled homophobic abuse at him as well, saying: ''You're a poof as well - we know all about your life.'

He added: 'You know, you look pale.  Are you on drugs or has someone s****** you too much?

'One of your boyfriends been ** **** ****?'

Mr Tilbrook put his footage, which he says bears at 2012 date stamp because he used a 'cheap camera', on YouTube, where it has had more than 120,000 views.

Initially Mrs Morgan apologised for the remarks made on the tape, and in a statement she put out on Friday accused Mr Tilbrook of 'persistent hounding', saying her husband had reacted 'angrily' because of his 'ever-growing concern' for her safety.

However last night she published another statement, saying: 'I have come from a family background that has always been very accepting, many of my friends are gay and I have always felt happy that I am often referred to as a gay icon through my work. 

'I am utterly ashamed and devastated at the behaviour of my husband John and son-in-law Daren, and neither of them will have anything to do with my work, my business, and right now I honestly have no idea what is going to happen to my marriage.'

Enigmatically, the statement concluded: 'There will be many more important decisions being made over the course of this week.' 

Mr Tilbrook told MailOnline today that his leaflets were not specifically about Sally Morgan, saying: 'I just wanted those who were attending a psychic show to have all the information they needed to make an informed choice about whether psychics have real powers or whether they just appear to have them.'

He added: 'From the very first time I was handing out leaflets on the street, John Morgan harassed and threatened me - telling me to "F*** off before I floor you". 

'Not once did I ever approach him, and I would have preferred it if he had just left me alone.'

Mr Tilbrook said Mr Morgan's behaviour was 'inexcusable', and said he was angry that Mrs Morgan had initially 'inferred what happened was justified because I was somehow "hounding" them.'

He added: 'The reaction from Sally Morgan's team has been totally unjustified and threatened my right to free speech.'

Mrs Morgan did not reply to MailOnline's requests for a comment.
