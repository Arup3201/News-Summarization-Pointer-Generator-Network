Red-faced: Killing Kittens 'sextrepreneur' Emma Sayle was left embarrassed by an email glitch

An upmarket sex party organiser has been left red-faced after a technical glitch sent hundreds of emails to members of her club.

Self-styled 'sextrepreneur' Emma Sayle, who was a rowing team-mate of the Duchess of Cambridge until 2007, runs the Killing Kittens parties which are billed as being ultra-discreet and start with guests wearing masks to hide their identities - only taking them off when they wish to reveal who they are.

But that discretion was breached when clients who replied to an email invite to a Christmas party found that a virus circulated their reply throughout the club's mailing list.

Guests had been instructed to wear festive underwear or 'anything kinky' .

Several members contacted former Downe House boarding school pupil Miss Sayle to ask why their email inbox was inundated with replies from other club members.

Fortunately no one's email address was sent out, only their replies.

The Killing Kittens brand has previously organised 'kidnap role play experiences' for more than £3,000 and sells sex toys.

She was quizzed by police in 2010 after she was reported for a Facebook update saying: 'Just had a two-hour shooting lesson.

'She will now be using this skill on the top of east London high rises to help with the UK's illegal immigrant problems.'

The Crown Prosecution Service decided to take no action against her.

She founded the Killing Kittens company seven years ago. The firm hosts two parties a month for the ‘sexual elite’ at secret, upmarket locations, which include a discreet boutique hotel in Surrey, country estates in Berkshire and West Sussex, and luxury penthouses in London and LA.

Those who hope to gain access must be aged between 18 and 45 and must either be a single girl or part of a couple.

The parties cost between £120 and £150 for a couple, or £50 for a single girl.

Team-mates: Miss Sayle rowed with the Duchess of Cambridge as part of the Sisterhood rowing team until 2007
