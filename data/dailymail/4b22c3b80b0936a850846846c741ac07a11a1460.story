A 26-year-old master's degree student working as a trainee social worker at a school for troubled teens in Chicago was charged Saturday with having sex with a student.

Brandi Edwards admitted in court that she had a sexual relationship with the 16-year-old sophomore at RISE  Alternative High School starting in November.

The relationship began when Edwards wrote her phone number on the boy's journal, reports the Chicago Tribune.

Brandi Edwards has admitted to having sex with a 16-year-old student at the Chicago high school where she was interning as a trainee social worker while working on her master's degree

Soon after, in November, Edwards allegedly picked the boy up and had sex with him in her car outside his home.

Before the meeting, prosecutors say the two exchanged sexual text messages. 

Edwards and the boy had sex a second time in her car and then a third time at a forest preserve, prosecutors said Saturday.

They had sex a final time at a hotel room, say investigators.

At this weekend's court hearing, Cook County Judge Adam Bourgeois Jr. was none too pleased with the admitted sex offender.

'Some days, I'm baffled,' he said. 

Judge Bourgeois ordered Edwards to wear an ankle monitoring bracelet and to stay in her Homer Glen home.

'You better not set foot outside that house,' the judge said.

Edwards was also ordered not to have any contact with the boy via social media. 

Edwards was charged Saturday with sexual assault of a minor. She had a months-long sexual relationship with the alternative high school sophomore, authorities say
