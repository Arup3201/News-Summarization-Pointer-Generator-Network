Bayern Munich are keeping close tabs on Liverpool starlet Raheem Sterling as they prepare for next summer's transfer window.

Despite being only halfway through the current season, Pep Guardiola is already casting his mind forward to the 2015-16 campaign, readying targets for his side.

Borussia Dortmund forward Marco Reus is known to be Bayern's first choice forward target next summer, but it is understood Sterling has been identified as one of the alternatives should a move for the Germany forward fail to materialise.

The news underlines Sterling's reputation as one of the best emerging talents in European football.

The development will be of interest to Liverpool, who are trying to tie the England star down to an improved deal.

Sportsmail reported last week how the Anfield club are struggling to agree a contract with Sterling, having made an informal offer of a five-year deal worth up to £70,000.

But a deal is yet to be agreed as the 20-year-old weighs up his future.

Sterling is understandably keen to continue playing in the Champions League.

Liverpool, as it stands, look way off qualifying for next season's competition - their defeat against Manchester United on Sunday underlined their problems on the pitch.

Liverpool and Sterling, who is currently on £25,000 per week, remain optimistic a deal can be reached as talks continue.

But the next few weeks could prove critical in deciding the player's future.
