Bedlam broke out in the Texas state Senate on Tuesday night after a state Senator wearing pink running shoes tried to filibuster a sweeping anti-abortion bill for 13 hours, but fell less than two hours short.

A crowd of hundreds of her supporters in the Senate gallery then took up her cause and attempted to shout down the Republican lawmakers before they could vote on the measure that would close nearly every abortion clinic in the state.

The Republicans who control the Senate say they passed the bill with seconds to spare before the legislative session ended at midnight. Democrats claim time ran out and that any vote passing Senate Bill 5 is void.

It remains unclear whether the bill passed in time, but the last-minute procedural wrangling on the floor of the Texas Senate is likely to be challenged in court.

Failed: Texas state Senator Wendy Davis, 50, fell less than two hours short of successfully filibustering an anti-abortion bill

Filibuster: Texas state Senator Wendy Davis, a Fort Worth Democrat, attempted to block an anti-abortion bill by speaking for 13 hours straight

Pro tip #2: Wear comfy shoes. Mrs Davis wore pink running shoes to prepare for the marathon session of speaking - for which she was not even allowed to lean against the table

The drama in Texas began with 
Democratic state Senator Wendy Davis, who laced up a pair of pink 
running shoes about 11am Tuesday and settled in for a grueling marathon 
filibuster. If she managed to continue speaking non-stop for 13 hours 
until the Texas legislative session ended at midnight, she could prevent
 the Republican majority for voting on - and passing - the bill.  

Strict
 state Senate rules dictated that the 50-year-old mother of two could 
not sit down, take a bathroom break or even lean against her table in 
order to continue the filibuster. She also had to continue speaking 
about subjects that were 'germane' to the bill.

But, her filibuster failed about 10pm Tuesday night, less than two hours shy of her goal. Senate 
Republicans ruled her out of order after 11hours when she 
broke procedural rules three times - twice for speaking about subjects that 
were not related to the abortion bill.

The other infraction came when a Democratic colleague helped David put on a back brace about 7pm, after she had been speaking non-stop for eight hours. 

Democrats chose Davis, of Fort Worth, 
to lead the effort because of her background as a woman who had her 
first child as a teenager and went on to graduate from Harvard Law 
School.

In the hallway 
outside the Senate chamber, thousands of women stood in line, waiting for
 people in the gallery to give up their seats. Women's rights supporters
 wore orange T-shirts to show their support for Davis, and Texas Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst 
reminded those in the gallery that interrupting the proceedings could 
results in 48 hours in jail.

Packed: Dozens of supporters and opponents of the bill lined the state Senate chamber to watch the filibuster

Davis
 tried to stay comfortable and sharp by shifting her weight from hip to 
hip and slowly walking around her desk while reading notes from a large 
binder on her desk. When a male protester stood in the Senate gallery 
and shouted, 'Abortion is genocide,' Davis continued talking 
uninterrupted as the man was removed by security.

The
 filibuster Tuesday directed national attention on the Texas statehouse 
in Austin. Abortion rights supporters say the strict new abortion clinic
 regulations would severely limit women's access to abortions in the 
nation's second-largest state.

President
 Barack Obama tweeted: 'Something special is happening in Austin 
tonight. #StandWithWendy,' along with a link to watch live coverage of 
the filibuster.

The hash tag #StandWithWendy became the second-most trending topic on Twitter and nearly than 150,000 people tuned in on the live video feed of the Senate debate.

After Davis was forced to stop speaking, her Democratic colleagues attempted to carry on her work by launching numerous procedural appeals Dewhurst's ruling to end the filibuster.

At one point Democratic state Senator Leticia Van De Putte protested that Dewhurst, who acts as the President of the Senate, had not responded to one of her motions.

Thousands of supporters tried to shout down Republican lawmakers to prevent them from taking a vote on the bill

'Did the President hear me or did the President hear me and refuse to recognize me?' she asked.

'At what point must a female senator raise her hand or her voice to be recognized over her male colleagues?'

The comment drew cheers from supports in the Senate hall.

After the Republicans cleared away all procedural hurdles - with minutes before the midnight deadline - it became clear that they were preparing to vote on the bill.

The thousands of opponents of the law began screaming, booing and applauding from the gallery of the Senate in an attempt to stop Dewhurst from taking a vote before midnight.

Both houses of the Texas legislature are controlled by the Republicans, who heavily favor the anti-abortion bill. Republican Governor Rick Perry has promised to sign the bill. The GOP holds 61percent of the Senate - just shy of the two-thirds majority needed to end debate and break a filibuster. 

If signed into law, the measures would close almost every abortion clinic in Texas, a state 773 miles wide and 790 miles long with 26 million people. A woman living along the Mexico border or in West Texas would have to drive hundreds of miles to obtain an abortion if the law passes.

In her opening remarks, Davis said she was 'rising on the floor today to humbly give voice to thousands of Texans' and called Republican efforts to pass the bill a 'raw abuse of power.'
