It is not often that opportunities have been squandered during this blissful summer for Rory McIlroy but one certainly slipped through his fingers in the first round of the BMW Championship on Thursday.

At five under par with three holes to play, the Open and USPGA Champion was two shots clear and threatening to make one of his ominous opening day statements in this penultimate event in the race for the $10 million bonus for the FedEx Cup.

Bogeys at his 16th and 17th holes, however, rather changed the complexion of his round and turned the spectacular into the merely very good. The frustrated look he wore at the end was that of a man feeling short-changed. 

Good start... but Rory McIlroy will be kicking himself for a poor finish in the opening round

He is still the joint leader after a 67, mind, albeit in a tie now with Americans Jordan Spieth and Gary Woodland. 

An enormous crowd turned up to watch McIlroy fly the ball prodigious distances through the thin Rocky Mountain air. For 15 holes it was his work around the greens that must have left his fellow competitors with the all-too familiar feeling they lacked the necessary firepower.

Three birdies in a row to start his back nine were all due to his short game prowess but, for once, he struggled thereafter to keep the ball on the fairways.

‘It is still a really good start but there were definitely a couple of sloppy bogeys at the end,’ said McIlroy. 

‘It’s tricky out there. You’re hitting irons and fairway woods off the tees but they’re still running into the rough, while the greens are getting quicker all the time. You’re having to land the ball ten yards before where you were landing it in practice.’

McIlroy warmed up in spectacular style, clearing the netting at the far end of the driving range – just the 370 yards away - and landing his ball on the adjoining University Boulevard.

Here at storied Cherry Hills, jaws dropped at the iconic 1960 United States Open when Arnold Palmer thrashed at his ball in trademark style to drive the 318 yard par four opening hole. Now here was McIlroy, creating another legend with drives that were literally finishing out of sight.

On the course itself, the driver remained largely sheathed thanks to the thick rough that placed a high premium on hitting the fairways but there were still a couple of near 400 yard boomers.

The altitude helps, of course, with the ball thought to fly 5-8 per cent further for most golfers. When you hit it as high as McIlroy, though, it is more like 15 per cent. ‘I also hit a 3-wood 370 yards in practice, so that was pretty good,’ said the 25 year old. ‘The ball seems to be going forever.’ 

McIlroy’s driving has become such a buzz topic that American Erik Compton was desperate to accompany him in a practice round to see for himself what all the fuss was about.

His verdict? ‘I played with Tiger during his all-conquering summer in 2000 and what I saw today was comparable with what I saw playing with Tiger except Rory has more power,’ he said. 

‘Rory is a lot longer than Tiger ever was. I have never seen anybody play with that kind of power and control.’

With the Ryder Cup looming every closer, it’s inevitable these final two FedEx events will be analysed to see who’s in form and who is not. 

Half the European team are among the 70 players competing here – that number will be whittled down to just 30 for the finale next week, the Tour Championship – and there were a number of encouraging performances.

In addition to McIlroy, Martin Kaymer and Sergio Garcia shot 68s, while Henrik Stenson was two under playing the final hole when the horn sounded for a weather suspension. He will finish up on Friday.

Justin Rose was a bit like McIlroy in feeling he had let a great round slip away. He started with three straight birdies but had to settle for a one under par 69.

Graeme McDowell, in his first round since becoming a parent for the first time, was the only European to finish over par. He was three over with his 18th hole to finish on Friday morning.

Spieth was by miles the best of the 12 American Ryder Cup players on view, with none of the others managing to finish in the top 20 on day one. Of most concern for captain Tom Watson on his 65th birthday would have been the lamentable performance of Patrick Reed, who shot 77.
