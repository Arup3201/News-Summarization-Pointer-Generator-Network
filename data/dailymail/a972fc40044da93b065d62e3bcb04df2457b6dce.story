More than 100,000 people have bought ceramic poppies from the Tower of London's art installation that pays tribute to British and Commonwealth soldiers killed in the First World War.

Sales of the poppies, from ceramic artist Paul Cummins' installation Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red, have raised more than £2.5million in just two days, the profits of which will go directly to six charities for servicemen and women.

Today Mr Cummins, who works from his studio in Derbyshire, described the public reaction to his art, in which one poppy for each dead soldier is being placed in the dry moat at the Tower of London, as 'overwhelming'.

Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red: Poppies from the installation at the Tower of London are selling fast

Each poppy is the size of a man's fist and attached to a two-foot metal stalk so it can be planted into the ground

'I've been staggered by the response and support from members of the public,' he said.  'When I had the idea, I never imagined the reaction would be so overwhelming.

'I think that it is something everybody can relate to and they feel very personally about.'

The artist had the idea for a 'sea of red' after reading the will of a Derbyshire man who joined up and died in Flanders.

'I don't know his name or where he was buried or anything about him,' said Cummins, who found the will among other old records in Chesterfield.

'But this line he wrote, when everyone he knew was dead and everywhere around him was covered in blood, jumped out at me: 'The blood-swept lands and seas of red, where angels fear to tread.'

'I believe he meant the angels to refer to his children.'

The poppies, which are hand-sculpted and fixed to two-foot metal stalks, are currently being planted in the ground.  By Armistice Day on November 11, there will be 888, 246, each one representing a British or colonial soldier, sailor or airmen who died in the Great War.

The poppies are for sale for £25, and after Armistice Day they will be removed from the ground and sent to their buyers with a certificate.

Online sales only opened on Tuesday, but staff at the Tower of London say more than 100,000 poppies have sold already, and demand is growing.

General the Lord Dannatt, Constable of the Tower of London: 'We're absolutely delighted with the response from the public.'

Ten per cent of the sale price, plus all profits, will go to six service charities: Combat Stress, Coming Home, Help For Heroes, the Royal British Legion, SSAFA and the Confederation of Service Charities (Cobseo).

A Tower of London spokesman said: 'The charities will receive ten per cent of every poppy sold.

'However, they will also receive an equal share of the net proceeds once all costs have been recovered. 

'These are costs incurred by Historic Royal Palaces and Paul Cummins Ceramics in manufacturing, transporting, installing and selling the poppies as well as VAT. 

'The ten per cent donation from each poppy, combined with the net proceeds, will raise millions of pounds for the six charities if all poppies are sold,and Historic Royal Palaces and Paul Cummins Ceramics will not profit from the sale of the poppies.' 

Volunteers began installing the poppies on Tuesday and will continue until Armistice Day.  During this time, every night at twilight the names of 180 serving military are being read out in a roll of honour, followed by the Last Post bugle call played by a single bugler at Tower Hill terrace.
