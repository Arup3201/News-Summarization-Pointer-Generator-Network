It’s one of America’s greatest landmarks - a beacon that has welcomed countless millions of immigrants into New York and now appears on postcards and images sent around the world.

But what you may not know about the Statue of Liberty is that it hasn’t always been green - as it was made with an exterior of copper and originally had a far more shiny appearance.

Lady Liberty is made of copper 3/32 inches thick, which is the same as putting two pennies together, but it has naturally oxidised over time to form the green ‘patina’ coating.

Different: The Statue of Liberty in New York hasn't always been green - as it was made with an exterior of copper and originally had a much more shiny appearance (as shown in this mocked-up edited image)

Old pictures: These adverts for Liebig's beef extract, left, and Superior Silk thread, right, were both issued soon after the statue was built in the 1880s and show Lady Liberty in her original form

This coating actually protects the copper behind it from naturally wearing away. But the copper, along with the statue’s height, also makes her a welcoming target for lightning strikes.

The current replacement torch was installed 25 years ago and is a copper flame covered in 24 carat gold, according to the National Parks Service website.

The statue, which is located on Liberty Island in New York, will be closed for a year at the end of next month as it undergoes a $27million renovation to redevelop the interior.

But the renovations are limited to the monument, Liberty Island will remain open and the statue itself will be mostly unobstructed from view, officials said.

The National Parks Service, which manages the Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island, said it will close the monument on October 28, after the 125th anniversary of its dedication.

Joseph A. Natoli Construction Corporation of Pine Brook, New Jersey, will install improved stairways and upgrade electrical and fire suppression systems, elevators and bathrooms.

The statue was closed after 9/11 for security precautions, but the base reopened in 2004 after a $20million security upgrade and the observation deck at the top of the crown reopened in 2009.

About 3.5 million people visit every year. It was built in the 1880s and was a gift from France.
