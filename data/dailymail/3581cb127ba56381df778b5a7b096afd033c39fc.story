Dalton Hayes, the older half of the teenage Bonnie & Clyde duo arrested in Florida two weeks ago, refused to sit in court when he saw TV news cameras today.

Hayes, 18, stood up and shouted at Judge Kenneth Harold Goff II on Wednesday when he spotted the cameras at a hearing.

'Harold, no disrespect to your courtroom, but I'm not staying here with that media,' he said, according to WLKY-TV.

The judge allowed Hayes to leave the Grayson County, Kentucky, courtroom and continued the hearing after a short discussion with the teen's lawyer about a mental competency hearing. 

Hayes' defense lawyer has argued that the teen is not mentally competent to stand trial. 

He will appear in court again on February 5 following a mental evaluation.  

Hayes is accused of custodial interference, second-degree rape, theft by unlawful taking, burglary, criminal trespassing and criminal mischief after a nearly two-week crime spree with his 13-year-old girlfriend that spanned from Kentucky to Florida.

Hayes ran away with his 13-year-old girlfriend and allegedly went on a multi-state crime spree before the two were caught in Florida

The brazen nature of the alleged crimes and the age of the two teens involved caused national media attention. 

Hayes and his girlfriend were caught in Panama City Beach, Florida, on January 18. 

Hayes was extradited back to Kentucky to stand trial. 

The girl was sent back to her father - from whom she ran away.

The girl's mother, Sherry Peters, faces charges of custodial interference after she allegedly picked the girl up from her father's house - even though she has no parental rights.
