In the lottery of life it turns out men don't fare as well as women, with the death rate for Australian males 50 percent higher than it is for females, new data shows.

The latest figures on morality show women often outlive men, with the male death rate 1.5 times higher than that of females.

If men had the same death rate as women, there would have been 71,400 fewer male deaths over the 2009-11 period, according to Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data.

But the inequality spreads much wider than just gender, with being Indigenous or living in very remote areas also significant factors influencing death rates.

The death rate among Indigenous Australians was higher than that of non-Indigenous Australians in all age groups, but it was five times higher for those people aged between 35-44.

People living in remote areas had death rates 1.4 times as high as those of city dwellers, and higher rates of death due to diabetes and land transport accidents.

'For people living in areas of lowest socioeconomic status, the death rate was 1.3 times as high as for those living in areas of the highest socioeconomic status, with death rates from diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease notably higher, at 1.8 times as high and 1.7 times as high, respectively,' Louise York, spokeswoman for the Institute, said.

Overseas-born Australian residents had lower death rates than those who were born in Australia.

Asian-born Australian residents had a death rate that was 36 percent lower than the rate for Australian-born residents, while women born in Europe had a 24 percent lower rate than Australian-born women.

'Many of these patterns for 2009-11 were similar to patterns from 10 years earlier, showing that mortality inequalities are long-standing in Australia,' Ms York said.

'We also found that the Australians who had the worst death rates tended to experience deaths from causes that, in many cases, can be considered to be preventable or treatable. These are often referred to as potentially avoidable deaths.'
