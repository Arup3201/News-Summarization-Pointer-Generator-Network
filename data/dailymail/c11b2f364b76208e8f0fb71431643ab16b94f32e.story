Police are searching for a father who punched another customer for eyeing-up his daughter in a supermarket.

The girl and her dad were ordering a sandwich in the convenience store Wawa, in Philadelphia, when he caught another customer looking at his child. 

Instead of walking away, the overprotective father decided to hit the man in the face which caused serious injuries.

Wanted: Police would like to speak to this man in the red top in connection with the attack

The suspect, who was dressed in a red polo shirt, then fled the store on 69th Street near Paterson Avenue.

The victim was taken to Delaware County Memorial Hospital for treatment.

Upper Darby Police Department is investigating the assault and has released a CCTV image of the suspect.

Speaking to Philly.com, Superintendent Michael Chitwood, said: 'If somebody's looking at your daughter, why don't you confront him instead of punching him?

Do you recognise this man? Police have released this CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to

'This guy's not an overprotective father... That's just his excuse for thumping the guy.' 

The suspect and his daughter fled the store in a four-door car, believed to be a Ford. 

Anyone with information about the identity of the man or girl should call 610-734-7693.
