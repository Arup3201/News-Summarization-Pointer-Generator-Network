Grieving relatives have thrown a seventh birthday party for a six-year-old boy four months after he was allegedly beaten to death by his stepfather.

Elijah Dillard was found unresponsive at his home in Saginaw, Michigan with extensive burns and head trauma on February 27 and two days later, he passed away.

His stepfather, Aki Dillard, a convicted felon, has been charged with his murder, while his mother, Mio Campbell, is charged with child abuse. Both are awaiting trial.

But back in their community, relatives and friends are missing the fun-loving little boy, and decided to pay tribute to his short life by encouraging other children to take part in the activities he loved.

On Thursday - the eve of what would have been his seventh birthday - crowds gathered to dance, sing, play soccer and socialize - many wearing t-shirt's showing the little boy's face.

'There are kids out here who knew him and didn't know him,' Omarr Dillard, Elijah's uncle, told Mlive. 'But they understand what it means, and they are here doing things he is no longer able to do.'

Missed: Elijah, six, passed away a few days after he was found unresponsive in his family's home

Since the 
little boy passed away, Omarr and his wife Ta-Tanesha, have become 
advocates against child abuse and, as well as the party, they are 
organizing a walk and anti-child-abuse rally.

'I hate we had to experience this, but I thank God that he put it in our hands and we can go forward with it,' Dillard said. 'Elijah is our adrenaline.'

He said it was emotional planning Elijah's party but that the family knows the boy would have loved it.

'It's
 something that has to be done. It's something that we can't forget. We 
want his name to live forever,' Omarr added to WNEM.

Others at the birthday party paid tribute to the little boy.

'He
 was one of the best kids. He sang a lot, he was never bad, it was sad 
he got beat to death for no reason,' Londall Dillard, Elijah's cousin, 
told WNEM.

His family has also created youth basketball, dance teams and a cheerleading team to help youngsters in the community.

Saginaw 
police officers were 
called to Elijah Dillard's home for a report that the boy was 
unresponsive and they arrived to find the child, who was still 
conscious, was covered in burns. He passed away days later.

Prosecutors charged Aki 
Dillard, 39, with first-degree premeditated murder, felony murder, 
torture and first-degree child abuse and he is being held without bond.

The boy's mother, who had given custody of Elijah to a family friend until he was three, faces one child abuse count and is 
jailed on a $5 million bond.

Court records in Illinois show Dillard was sentenced to five years and 10 months on a felony robbery charge in 1994, following nine misdemeanor convictions of battery between 1992 and 1993.

Then in 1999, he was convicted of second-degree murder in 1999 and spent 10 years in prison until he was discharged from parole in April 2011.

Dillard became the boy's legal father after he married Campbell and the child's biological father gave his permission.
