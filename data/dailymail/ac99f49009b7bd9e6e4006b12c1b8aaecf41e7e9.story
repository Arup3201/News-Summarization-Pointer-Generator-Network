Campaigners have described as ‘disgraceful’ a decision by Ministers to slash the level  of fines for hospitals hit by potentially fatal superbugs.

The Government claims to have a zero-tolerance approach to the issue. But The Mail on Sunday has discovered that Health Ministers have agreed to:

Health officials claim the cuts have been made because to allow the hospitals to cope with the superbug

One of the most vocal campaigners is Bucks Fizz star Cheryl Baker, 60, whose mother-in-law died of Clostridium difficile in 2006.

She said: ‘This is outrageous. It’s disgraceful. My mother-in-law had no dignity at her death.

‘She had no control over her bowels. The C. diff ate through her bowels and poisoned her blood. She died of septicaemia.’

Health officials claim the unpublicised changes have been made because many hospitals are doing all they can to beat the bugs.

Details were published in an NHS England document outlining C. diff ‘objectives’ for 2014/15.

It says some infections are a consequence of ‘factors outside the control of the NHS’.

Many hospitals have been hit with fines for having more than 4,477 cases of the superbug

Targets have been relaxed at 89 of 160 English hospital trusts.

Last year (2013/14), they were collectively allowed 4,477 cases before fines were imposed.

Many missed their targets and about 5,500 cases were recorded in all.

This year the hospitals will be allowed to record 4,976 cases, a rise of 499 or more than ten per cent.

At some hospital trusts, the threshold has been almost doubled.

The number of allowable cases at the Royal Bolton Hospital, Lancashire, has been increased from 28 to 48, a change local GP Dr Stephen Liversedge said was ‘ridiculous’.

Ms Baker said: ‘They are acting as if they have solved the problem. But we can’t take a step backwards – it’s morally wrong.’

Let doctors decide if an infection counts towards a fine, making it easier for hospitals  to avoid sanctions.
