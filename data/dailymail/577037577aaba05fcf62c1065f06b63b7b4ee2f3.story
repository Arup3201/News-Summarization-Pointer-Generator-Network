Arsene Wenger was at last able to relax and savour an emphatic winning performance — and his name rang around the Emirates Stadium.

Only a week after Wenger was verbally abused by a group of Arsenal supporters at a train station on the way home from a defeat at Stoke, this emphatic win against Newcastle had fans singing in support of the manager.

Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla scored two goals each as they overwhelmed Alan Pardew’s team, for whom Ayoze Perez scored a consolation.

Giroud scored his second with a neat flick at the near post that rifled past Alnwick into the top corner

Giroud said: ‘I did not want to talk a lot about the situation (fans criticising Wenger) because it is always the same when you’re losing; the man to be criticised is the boss. It’s part of the job and we have to deal with that.

‘We’ll always be together, keep the faith, keep working hard and I think there’s no thoughts about changing the boss as he’s still the man for the situation. It’s nice to hear the fans supporting him and it’s a fantastic night for us.’

Three points eased the Gunners, who lie sixth, closer to the Champions League places, but it was the nature of the performance which will have delighted Wenger.

Santi Cazorla also scored twice during the 4-1 win, the first a smart finish past Alnwick after some brilliant play

He said: ‘The most important thing is that our fans go home happy because we won. I have worked in this country for 18 years and I am grateful for that, but 99.9 per cent will still have respect, even when they are not happy, so I can live with the 0.1 per cent.

‘You want the fans to be happy and when we lose and they are not happy, I completely understand.’ 

His side, still beset by injuries, were positive and fluent in attack and scored some wonderful goals, starting with a header from Giroud after 15 minutes.

Arsenal had not scored in the first half of their previous six Premier League games but they set off like a team with a point to prove. Per Mertesacker glanced a header against the bar before Giroud opened the scoring with a fine header from an Alexis Sanchez cross.

Wenger’s team thought they had the second within a minute but Danny Welbeck’s goal was ruled out by referee Lee Mason, who decided the scorer had fouled Daryl Janmaat as he jinked into the penalty area from the left.

Newcastle’s Cheick Tiote was fortunate not to be sent off after only five minutes. Tiote followed through with a waist-high challenge on Sanchez and sank his studs into the Chilean’s midriff.

Cazorla scored the second soon after the restart with a deft chip from a tight angle to deceive Newcastle’s 21-year-old goalkeeper Jak Alnwick.

Giroud appeared at the near-post to flick in the third, before Perez scored with a diving header. Cazorla chipped in Arsenal’s fourth from the penalty spot.
