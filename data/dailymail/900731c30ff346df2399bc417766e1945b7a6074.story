George Ford orchestrated a record annihilation of former club Leicester at The Rec yesterday to enhance his England prospects.

It felt like a changing of the guard as the Tigers were buried under the West Country side’s dazzlingly ambitious attacking play, which yielded five touchdowns — one a cast-iron certainty for any ‘try of the season’ shortlist.

It was the biggest Bath win against these opponents and the first time Leicester have failed to score in the Premiership. They lost Manu Tuilagi and Anthony Allen before kick-off due to injuries —groin and knee respectively — they lost the game by a country mile and by the end they had lost their heads under pressure. 

Bath's George Ford stole the show at the Recreation Ground against Leicester by leading his side to victory

To compound the visitors’ misery, they wound up with more red cards than points, when scrum half David Mele was sent off in the closing stages for stamping.

Ford kicked 20 points and wielded the conductor’s baton with aplomb — comfortably eclipsing his fellow England No 10 candidate Freddie Burns. He was given an armchair ride due to the epic efforts of the Bath pack.

David Wilson inspired a demolition of the Leicester scrum and lock Dave Attwood delivered a colossal performance in front of watching England forwards coach Graham Rowntree; tackling himself to a standstill. Bath’s dominance up front allowed them to surge into a 23-0 half-time lead, with tries by Semesa Rokoduguni and Jonathan Joseph. But the score that brought the house down came in the 57th minute.

Leicester were rumbling towards the Bath line but the ball popped out of their maul and Ford sent it left to Joseph. He scorched past Burns and passed on to Stuart Hooper.

After quick-step bursts by Kyle Eastmond and Ford, Attwood drove towards the line, then Eastmond stepped inside to stretch over.

It was a classic, length-of-the-field counter-attack.

There was no let-up from the hosts as Olly Woodburn finished off another long-range strike for the bonus point and Peter Stringer touched down six minutes from time.

The result will send shockwaves through the Premiership. ‘We were pretty relentless,’ said Ford. ‘Our players were on the edge.

‘We’ve got Northampton next, which is a sobering thought, but hopefully other teams will fear us after this. When we get it right; that’s what we can do.’

Leicester, who saw England forwards Tom Youngs and Geoff Parling come off injured, were chastened.

Director of rugby Richard Cockerill said: ‘We couldn’t cope with their physicality and we were outplayed across the field. We got what we deserved and I’m bitterly disappointed.’
