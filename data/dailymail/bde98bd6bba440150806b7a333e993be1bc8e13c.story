An international panel of experts are to re-examine all of the data gathered in the hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 to ensure search crews have been looking in the right place.

Government officials from Australia, China and Malaysia today pledged not to give up searching for the aircraft that disappeared almost two months ago.

They met in the Australian capital to discuss the next step in the search for the missing flight, which will centre around an expanded patch of seafloor in a remote area of the Indian Ocean off Western Australia.

The area became the focus of the hunt after a team of analysts calculated the plane's likeliest flight path based on satellite and radar data.

Starting Wednesday, that data will be re-analyzed and combined with all information gathered so far in the search, which has not turned up a single piece of debris despite crews scouring more than 4.6 million square kilometers (1.8 million square miles) of ocean.

'We've got to this stage of the process where it's very sensible to go back and have a look at all of the data that has been gathered, all of the analysis that has been done and make sure there's no flaws in it, the assumptions are right, the analysis is right and the deductions and conclusions are right,' Angus Houston, head of the search operation, told reporters in Canberra.

Investigators have been stymied by a lack of hard data since the plane vanished on March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A weekslong search for surface debris was called off last week after officials determined any wreckage that may have been floating has likely sunk.

'Unfortunately, all of that effort has found nothing,' Australian Transport Minister Warren Truss said. 'We've been confident on the basis of the information provided that the search area was the right one, but in practice, that confidence has not been converted into us discovering any trace of the aircraft.'

Houston has warned the underwater search is likely to continue for up to a year.

Financial responsibility is a major focus of the talks and Truss has seemed to open the door to Boeing, which produced the 777-200ER jet, and engine maker Rolls Royce, to contribute financially.

'They also have a vested interested in what happened on MH370 so they can be confident about the quality of their product, or take remedial action if there was some part of the aircraft that contributed to this accident,' he told reporters.

'So, I think we will be looking for increasing involvement from the manufacturers, and their host countries.'

Officials are contacting governments and private contractors to find out whether they have specialized equipment that can dive deeper than the Bluefin-21

Last week, Malaysia released its most comprehensive account yet of what happened to Flight MH370, detailing the route the plane probably took as it veered off course and the confusion that followed.

U.S. President Barack Obama had publicly promised to commit more assets, but government sources say the United States is keen to begin passing on the costs of providing the expensive sonar equipment the officials say they are trying to source.

Officials are contacting governments and private contractors to find out whether they have specialized equipment that can dive deeper than the Bluefin-21, an unmanned sub that has spent weeks scouring the seafloor in an area where sounds consistent with a plane's black box were detected in early April.

The Bluefin has been limited by the fact that it can dive only to depths of 4.5 kilometers (2.8 miles) - and parts of the search zone are likely deeper than that. Adding to the difficulties is the fact no one really knows exactly how deep the water in the search area is.

'I don't know that anyone knows for sure, because it's never been mapped,' Truss said, adding that detailed mapping of the seafloor will be a key focus of the next phase of the search.

In addition to deeper diving capabilities, the new equipment will be able to send information back to crews in real time. The Bluefin's data can be downloaded only once it returns to the surface after each of its 16-hour dives.

It will likely take another two months before any new equipment is in the water, Truss said. The Bluefin will continue to be used in the meantime, though its search is currently on hold while the Ocean Shield, which has the sub on board, is taking on supplies at a base in Western Australia.

The 21-foot-long autonomous underwater vehicle is designed for deep-sea surveying and is capable of staying submerged for 25 hours at a time without refueling, scanning regions at a speed of two to three knots.

Shaped like a torpedo, it can operate almost up to three miles underneath the waves and is equipped with a variety of sonar and cameras that can search and map 40 square miles of sea floor per day.

Bluefin-21 has a depth rating of 4,500m, meaning it has been at its limit in the Indian Ocean search zone.

Searchers usually programme the propeller-driven vehicle with the coordinates for a back-and-forth search that has been compared to mowing a lawn.

First, the vehicle will survey the area with side-scan sonar.

The sonar readings are stored in the robot's removable memory, and retrieved once the sub comes back up to the surface.

If the sonar scan turns up objects of interest, the Bluefin-21 would be refitted with high-resolution cameras for a visual survey.

The robot would have to dive closer to the seafloor for a concentrated survey of the target area.

One of the Bluefin-21's most recent claims to fame was its role in the search for wreckage from Amelia Earhart's airplane, which disappeared in the Pacific in 1937.

Bluefin Robotics says its AUV can also be used for archaeology, oceanography, mine countermeasures, and unexploded ordinance.
