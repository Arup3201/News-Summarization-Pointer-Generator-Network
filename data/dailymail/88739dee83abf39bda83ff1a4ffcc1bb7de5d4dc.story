Chelsea star Willian and his mates looked like some sort of boy band when they were spotted hanging out in London on Thursday night.

The Brazilian forward made the most of a night off before the busy festive period of Premier League fixtures to take in the sights and sounds of the capital.

The 26-year-old posted a picture on Instagram of the group near Big Ben with the message: 'London vibes with my brothers.'

Willian has previously spoken of how if had he not made it as a footballer, he may have tried his luck with his musical skills.

‘Perhaps I would be playing music in Brazil,’ he said. ‘Percussion, drums, the pandeiro.’ 

Premier League leaders Chelsea face four fixtures in 10 days over hectic festive period

The pandeiro is the drum, a kind of tambourine with a tuneable head, that is regarded as the unofficial instrument of Brazil.

It is the sound of the Samba beat and an instrument Willian still plays now. 

He will take it on European trips and entertain his wife, Vanessa, and their two-year-old twin daughters at home in Kingston-upon-Thames.
