There was a mixture of excitement and terror on Neil Davy’s face as he rolled the tiny olive around in his hand. And who could blame him?

For this was no ordinary olive. It was an olive from the first harvest ever grown commercially in Britain.

And 42-year-old Neil, a management consultant who grew the olives on a plot of land outside his kitchen window, was about to step into the history books.

Inspired: Neil and Louise Davy (pictured with their daughters Kailas, 7, and Teagan, 4) have opened the UK's first olive farm after falling in love with the idea during their honeymoon on the Amalfi Coast in Italy in 2002

Despite knowing very little about the industry, the couple bought 200 trees from a small farm in northern Italy

Yes, the Romans might possibly have done it — but it’s taken another 2,000 years and a man on a culinary crusade to make it happen in 2014 in a garden in Kent’s Isle of Oxney.

It’s an achievement no one imagined possible. Not Neil’s curious neighbours. Not even his long-suffering wife, Louise, and daughters, Kailash, seven and four-year-old Teagan.

But last week Neil fulfilled a decade-long dream to develop Britain’s first productive olive grove.

It all started during the couple’s honeymoon in Italy. Having met in 1999 while both working in Shanghai — Neil for a market research company and Louise for Virgin Atlantic — they married in London in 2002 and left for a two-week honeymoon on the Amalfi coast.It was as they lay in a grove of olives to shelter from the afternoon sun that Neil had his epiphany. ‘We joked that if we won the Lottery, we would buy an olive grove in Italy,’ recalls Neil.

‘Louise, being the pragmatist of the two of us, thought I was mad.’

They never did win the Lottery, but Neil held onto his dream.

Back in London, their careers and life continued in a familiar rhythm. Kailash was born in March 2006 and Teagan in September 2009.

Then, in 2010, Neil and Louise decided to move away from the hubbub of the capital, and bought a four-bedroom Georgian farmhouse on Kent’s Isle of Oxney with a four-acre plot of land.

The plan was that Neil would commute to work in London, while Louise would run an interiors business from home.

Throughout those daily train journeys, Neil would constantly return to his dream.

‘Our land hadn’t been cultivated for 40 years and we were told it was only good for grazing,’ Neil explains. ‘But it seemed such a waste.

‘Then, one summer’s night, we were sitting on our terrace with a glass of wine and I looked out at the land and thought: Why buy an olive grove in Tuscany when we could do the same thing here?

‘The land is south-facing and free-draining, and we are in one of the warmest parts of the country.

Olives can tolerate poor soil and exposure to wind. I just knew we had to give it a go.

‘I was on the computer the next day, researching olive varieties. It hadn’t been done before — but that only made it more exciting.’

Neil decided to start with a small-scale trial, choosing 12 trees of six different varieties from local garden centres.

‘I planted them in March 2011. The summer was hot and dry and the trees did brilliantly. I wasn’t expecting any fruit — the key was knowing whether the trees would survive.

‘And they did. Even Louise was surprised.’

It was all the encouragement that Neil needed. Three varieties — Frantoio, Leccino and Maurino — had done particularly well, although it was too early in their life for them to have borne fruit.

After that, Neil contacted dozens of growers in Italy to see if they could supply him with trees. In March 2012, he found a traditional family-run nursery in northern Italy that seemed perfect.

‘They had the right trees — three years old, so not too expensive but still capable of giving a good yield.’

Tough: The Davy family's olives have endured frosts, snowfall and heavy rain, but have emerged unscathed

With his heart in his mouth, Neil ordered 200 trees. Each would cost upwards of £70 at a British garden centre — that’s at least £14,000 for the grove. Neil is reluctant to say exactly how much he paid, but admits the venture has cost him just shy of £5,000 so far.

After researching how sites are prepared for a Tuscan olive grove, Neil got to work. He commissioned a neighbouring farmer to prepare the site, spraying off the surface vegetation with chemicals.

‘I worried he would think I’d gone nuts,’ he admits. ‘But I guess the idea of an olive grove is so romantic that everyone has got behind it.’

Neil hired more machinery to allow him to mole plough — which means ripping deep into the soil to create channels for the water to drain easily. Then the top soil needed to be prepared for planting with a rotivator.

‘I didn’t have the experience or machinery to do any of this myself,’ admits Neil. ‘I oversaw the work at weekends.’

Louise watched from the kitchen window as her meadow was ripped up.

‘It was a shock,’ she admits. ‘It’s one thing Neil having a pipe dream. Following through is another thing entirely.’ 

Just four weeks later, in April 2012, a container arrived in the Davys’ drive with 200 olive trees —  and on a decidedly windswept, soggy day, Neil began the nerve-racking job of planting them, marshalling Louise, the girls, his mother, stepfather and a collection of curious neighbours to help. It took them two days to get the plants in.

‘I’d researched planting schemes and opted to plant the trees seven metres apart, which gave us enough room to plant more in the future,’ says Neil.

Peering out on the vulnerable-looking striplings over the following weeks and months, even Neil had to admit the whole project looked doomed.

‘It just kept raining,’ he recalls. ‘The trees were being drenched every single day. I was worried the roots wouldn’t cope and the plants would die. Yet somehow, thankfully, the trees survived.’

And so 2012 rolled into 2013 — but the weather remained terrible.

‘By the spring of 2013, it looked like an olive graveyard; a sea of brown twigs. I thought I’d failed and they’d all have to be dug up and thrown away. It was heartbreaking.’

‘I went out every night to check on them. Every so often the trees would try to come to life — but then another cold snap would kill off the new growth.’

But then, as June edged into July and the sun at last began to shine, the sea of brown twigs began to sprout bright green leaves. And one exciting morning, Neil noticed some tiny yellow flowers.

‘I tried not to be too optimistic,’ he admits.

But two weeks later there was no mistake. Out of each flower a tiny pinhead was emerging. Britain’s first olive grove was growing.

Progress was slow until one magical morning in September, Neil woke to see a mass of olives on his trees. It may have taken him ten years, but Neil had done it.

‘I got Louise and the girls out of bed — it’s a day we’ll never forget.’

The next hurdle was harvesting them. ‘I couldn’t risk a frost getting to them,’ explains Neil.

In the first week of November, Neil decided it was time — and the family proceeded to hand-pick each olive. Louise used her trusty mop bucket; the girls orange buckets left over from collecting Halloween treats.

‘Louise and I concentrated on the top branches and the girls took the lower ones,’ says Neil. ‘We were there all weekend and every day after school. It took a week and produced around 20 kilos.’

Neil was desperate to taste his first home-grown olive — but that was a delight that had to wait until last week.

‘Olives have to be cured in brine over many months to make them palatable,’ he explains. ‘I sent some of my harvest off to a wonderful local chef who promised to work his magic.’

So what do the olives taste like?  I joined Neil at The Swan, Chapel Down, Kent, where chef Paolo Rigolli has been curing the olives in salted water since November.

The first surprise is the intense colour. Because of the shorter growing season, Neil’s olives are tiny - barely bigger than a raisin - but they are a brilliant olive green. And they taste, well, truly olivey.

Yes, the skin is harder than a normal table olive and there’s less flesh, but the flavour is intense, each olive packing the flavour of four ordinary ones.

Neil is thrilled. ‘I didn’t dare hope they would taste good,’ he says. Chef Paolo has already used some in flavoured butters and oils.

His next move? ‘More olive trees. The land can support another 100 trees, so enough olives to produce Britain’s first homegrown olive oil.

‘Growing table olives is one thing. But producing a large enough crop to make oil is beyond my dreams.’
