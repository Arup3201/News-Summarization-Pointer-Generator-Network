Among the tragic victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were remarkable stories of survival - and heroism.

First grade teacher Kaitlin Roig escaped unharmed when crazed gunman Adam Lanza forced his way into the elementary school on Friday - and so did all of her students.

The 29-year-old had been teaching 15 children at about 9:30 that morning when
 the classroom windows suddenly shattered.

Reacting immediately, Ms Roig, 24, whisked the children into a bathroom.

She told ABC News: 'I put one of my students on top of the toilet. I was telling them, it's going to be OK, you're going to be all right.

'I told them to be absolutely quiet because I was just so afraid if he did come in he would hear us and start shooting the door.

'I said there are bad guys out there now. We need to wait for the good guys.

'The
 kids were being so good. They asked, "Can we go  see if anyone is out 
there? I just want Christmas, I don't want to die, I just want to have 
Christmas."

'I said, "You're
 going to have Christmas and Hanukkah." I tried to be positive. If they 
started crying I would take their face and say it's going to be OK.'

She was struck by the bravery of the children in her class.

She told the network: 'One of my students was saying, "I know karate, so it's OK."

'I said, “We're staying here until someone comes to get us out.”

When authorities did finally come to the bathroom, Ms Roig said she wasn't taking any chances.

'The
 police came and started knocking and obviously I was completely beside 
myself. I said, “I don't believe you. You need to put your badges under 
the door.” So they put their badges under the door.'

Another Sandy Hook educator, Maryrose Kristopik, also survived the attack uninjured, along with her students.

Ms Kristopik, 50, huddled in a storage room with 15 children while outside the gunman could be heard screaming: 'Let me in!'

The students had been in a music lesson watching The Nutcracker on TV when the gunshots started.

The group hid in the closet until police arrived to lead them to safety.
