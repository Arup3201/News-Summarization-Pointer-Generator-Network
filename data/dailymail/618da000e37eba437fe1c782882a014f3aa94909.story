Found: A letter written by Carl Hans Lody (pictured), the first German spy to be captured during the First World War, to his guards at the Tower of London has been found after 100 years

A letter written by the first German spy to be captured during the First World War to the Guards at the Tower of London has been found after 100 years.

Carl Hans Lody was shot by firing squad at the Tower in November 1914, after he was found guilty of war treason and sentenced to death.

Now, nearly 100 years after the 37-year-old was killed, a letter he wrote to the guards at the Tower, thanking them for the 'courtesy and consideration' shown towards him, has been unearthed.

In the letter to the guard's commanding officer, the German Lieutenant wrote: 'I feel it is my duty as a German officer to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to the guards and sentries.'

Asking for his thanks to be passed on to the men, he added: 'Although they never neglected their duty, they have shown always the utmost courtesy and consideration towards me.'

The letter was written the day before Lody's execution on November 6, 1914.

It has been stored at the Guards Museum at Wellington Barracks, but has now been uncovered as part of an exhibition at the museum on the First World War, and the role of the Foot Guards during the conflict.

Born in Berlin on January 20, 1877, Lody joined the German Navy in 1900 - serving for a year before he was transferred into the First Naval Reserve and then went on to enterthe merchant navy, where he served on English, Norwegian and American ships.

In 1904 he graduated as a captain from the Maritime Academy in Geestemünde, but became ill and was never able to take up the post. Instead he changed career and became a tourist guide - making many friends from the United States as a result of his new role.

In 1912, Lody married an American woman, and although the marriage did not last he managed to obtain a forged U.S. passport under the name Charles A Inglis - enabling Lody, who spoke English with an American accent, to travel throughout Europe.

As war loomed, Lody volunteered as a Sea Lieutenant, and offered to travel to Britain in order to observe and report back on the country's fleet.

His request was denied, and in 1914 he requested to be released from the Naval Reserve so he could go back to America.

At the outbreak of war, German naval intelligence decided that Lody's command of English and American passport would make him and ideal agent.

He was persuaded to travel to England to gather information on the actual losses suffered by the British fleet, Britain's air defences and the activities at Rosyth naval base in Fife, Scotland.

'I feel it is my duty as a German officer to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to the guards and sentries'

Carl Hans Lody, November 1914

However, Lody's intelligence gathering training was limited, and his attempts at espionage were somewhat inaccurate and amateurish.

Lody, who stayed at a hotel in Fife, sent his first coded report back by telegram transmitted via Sweden.

It read: 'Must cancel. Johnson very ill. 
Lost four days, Shall leave shortly, Charles.' This meant that there 
were four ships being repaired at the dock, and that several others were
 about to head out to sea.

The Germans dispatched the  U-21 submarine to
 this area with orders to attack the shipping about to leave. The lead 
ship was HMS Pathfinder, a class scout crusier, which became the first 
ship ever to be sunk by a torpedo fired from a submarine.

But
 after this Lody's lack of training started to show, and he began to 
make mistakes - putting his address on his letters and writing them in 
German, while he also stopped encrypting the contents.

His
 actions soon alerted the authorities, and although he fled to Killarney
 in Ireland he was arrested by police as a suspected spy.

Execution: Carl Hans Lody was shot by firing squad at the Tower of London in November 1914, after he was found guilty of war treason and sentenced to death

He was taken to London and detained at Wellington Barracks, before being convicted of espionage following a court martial at the Middlesex Guildhall in Westminster, and sentenced to death.

He had denied attempting to convey information calculated to be useful to an enemy through a letter sent from Scotland, and committing war treason by sending a letter to Berlin from Dublin.

During the second day of his trial he
 admitted that he was a German national and that the American passport 
found in his possession was a fake.

When the Provost Marshal went to Lody’s cell to collect him for execution, he is  alledged to have said: 'I suppose that you will not care to shake hands with a German Spy?'

The Provost Marshal responded: 'No. But I will shake hands with a brave man.'

He was executed on a miniature rifle range at the Tower by an eight man firing squad made up of members of the 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards.

His execution was meant to be a 
secret, but it was rumoured that members of the firing squad broke up 
the chair Lody was sitting on when executed and sold it in the local 
pubs.

Grateful: A sixpence which Lody gave to a guard looking after him as a tip

John Fraser, a Yeoman Warder at the time of Lody's death said of his execution:'The
 escort and the firing party, too, where far from comfortable, and one 
could see that the slow march suitable to the occasion was getting badly
 on their nerves. They wanted to hurry over it, and get the beastly 
business finished.

'But the 
prisoner walked steadly,  upright, and yet as easily and unconcerned as 
though he was going to a tea-party, instead of to his death. His eyes 
were upturned to the gloomy skies, and his nostrils eagerly drank in the
 precious air that was soon to be denied them. But his face was quite 
calm and composed - almost expressionless.

'Then
 came a queer and pathetic little incident. As the party came to the end
 of the Verandah, the Chaplain, in his nervousness made to turn left, 
which was the wrong way. Instantly Lody took a quick step forward, 
caught the Chaplain by the right arm and with a polite and kindly smile,
 gently guided him to the right - the correct way.

'A
 few minutres later the procession disappeared through the doorway to 
the sinister shed, and shortly after there came the muffled sound of a 
single volley. Carl Lody had paid!

'When I think of Karl Lody a phrase always slips into my head - just three little words: A gentleman unafraid!'

Lody was first buried in the Tower of London and later disinterred and transferred to the East London Cemetery in Plaistow then finally to Highgate Cemetery, north London.

The Tower of London's White Tower

Despite its bloody reputation, few executions actually took place inside the Tower of London, with many prisoners executed publicly at other sites in London, including nearby Tower Hill.

Private executions were reserved for only the most sensitive and high profile cases, such as the palace's most famous execution - the beheading of Anne Boleyn, King Henry VIII's second wife, who was convicted of infedility and incest and beheaded by a French swordsman near Tower Green in May 1536.

In total six people were executed at the Tower during the Tudor period - Countess of Salisbury Margaret Plantagenet Pole, Henry VIII's fifth wife Catherine Howard and her lady-in-waiting Lady Jane Rochford, Lady Jane Grey - who was named Queen following the death of Edward VI, and Robert Devereaux, the Earl of Essex, who became the last person to be officially beheaded at the Tower in 1601, under Queen Elizabeth 1.

All six are buried inside the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula, within the Tower.

On July 18, 1743 three men from the Black Watch regiment were shot at the Tower on charges of mutiny. The Highland regiment had been charged with keeping peace in Scotland, and were assured they were only be asked to serve there.

However, as they travelled to London to be inspected by the King they heard rumours that they were to be instead deployed to the Caribbean - leading around 100 men to turn back. They were taken to the Tower and all but three were pardoned.

In total 11 men of various nationalities were shot as spies by firing squad at the Tower between 1914 and 1918.

During the Second World War the Tower again served as a temporary prison and in August 1941 German Josef Jakobs was the last person to be executed there.

He had been caught as he parachuted into England and found guilty of espionage, before being shot by firing squad while seated in a chair in the East Casemates Rifle Range.
