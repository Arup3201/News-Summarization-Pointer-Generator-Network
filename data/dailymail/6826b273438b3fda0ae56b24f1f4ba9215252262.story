You may have been hoping for a flaming June but, if the forecasts are correct, it is going to be a washout in Britain.

And as a foretaste, torrential rain is expected today to bring flash flooding, with some parts of Norfolk experiencing 36 hours of non-stop rain.

The highest rainfall amount anywhere in Britain today since midnight this morning to 4pm this afternoon was at Bridlington, which has had 18.4mm (0.7in).

Some places could get more than an inch of rain in 24 hours - and 22 flood alerts were out in the Midlands, East Anglia and, North East and South East.

One more serious flood warning was also put in the place by the Environment Agency for the North Sea coast at Bridlington in East Yorkshire.

The plans of families across the country for barbecues, garden parties, fetes and festivals may have to be revised – in some cases, rather hastily.

The heaviest rain was expected in Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire and along the east coast, where some parts could see a fortnight’s worth in a few hours.

The Met Office issued a yellow warning
 - a moderate risk of severe weather – for Yorkshire and warned of 
travel chaos amid ‘heavy and persistent’ rain.

Officials
 warned households to ‘be prepared’ for possible flooding. Its alerts 
included several for villages along rivers in the Home Counties.

They
 said: ‘There may be some flooding of low-lying land and roads, some 
disruption to travel and possibly flooding to individual properties.’

Some
 parts of Norfolk experienced 36 hours of non-stop rain, with the fire 
service called to more than 25 flooding-related incidents in Norwich.

One
 car became stuck when a drain cover was raised by floodwater in sewers,
 while residents had to put out towels because of a lack of sandbags.

Stacey
 Connerty, of Hellesdon, told BBC News: ‘Yet again it is left to local 
people to risk their safety to save their property and vehicles from 
flooding.’

Looking ahead: Showers are predicted for the rest of the week, with drier weather towards the weekend

The wet weather is due to a depression blowing in from the Continent.

Sean
 Penston, from weather forecasters MeteoGroup, said: ‘There will be a 
moderate amount of rainfall, and given that we have seen a fair amount 
of rain in the past few days, with the high water table there is a 
chance of water developing on the surface.’

The
 Environment Agency’s £5million dredging scheme on the Somerset Levels 
is so far behind schedule that only 5 per cent of the area has been 
completed, it was claimed today.

The
 dredging began on March 28 but has removed only 13,050 cubic metres 
(460,000 cubic ft) of material so far - behind the target of 235,000 
cubic metres (8.3million cubic ft).

The
 Somerset Levels could now be at risk of flooding again - just months 
after the area experienced the worst flooding in 250 years.

The dredging must be finished by October before winter rain and high tides are forecast to return, reported the Western Daily Press.

A
 Flooded Levels Action Group spokesman said it was ‘increasingly 
concerned’ about the progress, adding: ‘So far it has been slow’.

But Paul Gainey of the Environment Agency said it was on course to meet the deadline.

He
 added: ‘The system affecting us now will weaken over the next 36 hours.
 There will be a largely dry day on Friday for northern parts of the UK.
 In the south there is a risk of further showers but drier conditions 
will develop here on Saturday.

‘Even
 though it is quite miserable it is quite warm outside and muggy, and 
today there will be highs of 16C to 18C (61F to 64F) across south-east 
England away from the coasts.

‘Tomorrow onwards we are looking at a general warming trend, with 19C (66F) across south-east England.

‘But
 over the weekend we could see 21C to 22C (70F to 72F) across the South 
East and a predominantly dry day on Saturday. I wouldn't rule out rain 
or showers, but they won't be particularly heavy.

‘Sunday
 will be generally the same, though there will be the chance of the odd 
shower in south-eastern parts of England and the far north will see some
 rain.’

Next week will see 
rain moving in from the west on Monday and more showers over the 
following days. Mr Penston said: ‘Generally there will be rain and 
showers next week but less amount of cloud, so it won't be as 
miserable.’

There is little consolation in the Met Office UK outlook for June 2 to June 9, updated yesterday.

It
 warned: ‘The weather is likely to stay changeable with showers or 
longer spells of rain accompanied by breezy conditions at times, 
particularly across western areas at first.’

The
 outlook for June 10 to 24 is hardly any more encouraging: ‘Changeable 
weather looks more likely than not to persist into mid-June.

‘As
 such, conditions would then be mixed with showers or longer spells of 
rain, particularly for western areas, interspersed by some drier, 
brighter periods for most parts of the UK.’

Showers
 are predicted for the rest of the week, with drier weather towards the 
weekend - but there is no sign of hot weather similar to earlier this 
month.

The average rainfall for May is around 50mm (2in) but the North was told it can expect up to 40mm (1.6in) of rainfall yesterday and today alone.

Meanwhile, a behaviour expert has claimed people only feel sad in bad weather because they think about it too much, reported the Daily Telegraph.

Paul Dolan said that because people in Britain talk about the weather so much, it may be making us more depressed than the conditions outside.

The London School of Economics professor claimed studies had shown people who live in warmer climates are not happier than those in wetter areas.

He said: ‘Most of the time the weather doesn’t affect out wellbeing at all. But when we think about it, and think that it does, that’s when we get miserable.'

Watch out: A Met Office yellow 'be aware' weather warning for Yorkshire today

Today: Rain
 will continue across parts of England, although gradually easing 
through the day. Elsewhere it will stay cloudy, although some limited 
brighter spells are possible, but also isolated showers.

Outlook for tomorrow to Saturday: It
 will slowly turn drier and brighter during Thursday with rain 
continuing to ease. Bright or sunny spells and variable cloud follows on
 Friday and Saturday, but also isolated showers

UK outlook for May 31 to June 9: Largely
 cloudy but mainly dry conditions are expected through Saturday although
 a few showers may develop across western areas. Through Sunday, more 
persistent rain across western areas is likely to push east through the 
day, with sunshine and showers following. The rain may well turn heavy 
for a time as it moves eastwards. Whilst temperatures will be near 
normal, it will feel cool with the rain. The weather is likely to stay 
changeable thereafter with showers or longer spells of rain accompanied 
by breezy conditions at times, particularly across western areas at 
first. Despite this, there will be some warmer, drier and sunnier spells
 but with the risk of some chilly nights for the time of year.

UK outlook for June 10 to June 24: Changeable
 weather looks more likely than not to persist into mid-June. As such, 
conditions would then be mixed with showers or longer spells of rain, 
particularly for western areas, interspersed by some drier, brighter 
periods for most parts of the UK. Later in the month, there are signs 
beginning to emerge of a change towards more settled conditions, at 
least for the north of the UK. Temperatures are likely to be near or 
just below average during unsettled weather and near average or rather 
warm during brighter, more settled spells.
