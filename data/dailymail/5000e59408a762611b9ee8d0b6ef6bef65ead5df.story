They may have to wait until July for the arrival of Frank Lampard, but New York City fans were treated to a new signing on Tuesday; Rosenborg midfielder Mix Diskerud.

The 24-year-old Norwegian-born American joins on a free transfer ahead of the start of the MLS season in March, and will travel with the squad to England next month for two friendlies at Manchester City's academy.

Speaking to the club's website following the announcement, New York City's Sporting Director Claudio Reyna said:

'We couldn't be happier to have Mix coming to play in New York. He's one of the brightest young talents in US soccer and will be a fantastic addition to our Club and to MLS.

'Mix is a dynamic midfielder who will easily fit into the style we want to play here in New York City. He keeps possession well and gets everyone involved with his passing range.

Diskerud has been capped 25 times for the USA, and was a part of Jurgen Klinsmann's World Cup squad in Brazil last year.

The move, according to Diskerud, has made a dream become reality: 

'New York City FC have made my wish as an American a reality by giving me the opportunity to play and live in the US.

'Everybody I have spoken to on the men's national team about Jason Kreis has spoken highly of him to me. I felt exactly the same way after meeting him. 

'I'm sure he will help me to develop my game, to succeed with our team here in New York and to stay involved with the national team. Coming to play for New York City FC was an easy decision for me.'
