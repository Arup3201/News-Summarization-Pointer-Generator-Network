Chancellor George Osborne has introduced twice as many tax rises as he has cuts

The Coalition has increased nearly 300 taxes since its formation, a report reveals today.

Chancellor George Osborne has introduced more than twice as many tax rises as he has cuts.

The Treasury has implemented or pencilled in 299 separate increases since May 2010, but only 119 cuts.

And the new taxes will mean that taxpayers will shell out £671billion a year by 2015/16 – a 15 per cent increase on the £513billion in the final year of the Labour government.

Research from the centre-right think-tank, the TaxPayers’ Alliance, lays bare the extent of taxes that have been introduced.

In all, 254 tax rises have been introduced, with a further 45 pencilled in. To date, 109 tax cuts have been implemented with a further ten planned by the next general election, expected in May 2015.

Treasury sources tried to dismiss the research, saying it included the normal up-rating of taxes to bring them in to line with inflation, as well as counting tax-avoidance measures.

But Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Families are struggling to bear an increasingly heavy tax burden.

‘High taxes kill jobs, depress wages and increase prices.

‘With nearly 300 tax rises since the Government came to power, it is no wonder everyone is feeling squeezed. The crisis in the public finances came after a decade of tax rises, not tax cuts, but politicians are still coming back for more.

‘Endless tinkering at the edges of the tax system was a vice that George Osborne criticised in the last government, but of which he is equally guilty now he is in office.’

Even subtle changes created complications and could affect investment, Mr Sinclair warned.

‘That creates uncertainty which will undermine economic growth. Britain needs more lasting, strategic tax reform and less fiddling at the margins,’ he said. VAT has been tinkered with 60 times since May 2010. Of these changes, 55 have been rises.

Vehicle excise duty has been raised on 36 occasions and cut on just three. There have been ten changes to stamp duty – nine rises and one cut.

Income tax has been raised 35 times but cut 24 – including raising the threshold before it is payable to £9,200.

Government sources said Mr Osborne had always made clear he would have to introduce some taxes to clear up the economic mess left by the Labour government.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘In 2010 the Government was faced with the challenge of restoring Britain’s worst public finances in peacetime history.

‘We have had to take difficult decisions to deal with the deficit, including to increase some taxes, but we have done this while supporting hard-working people and businesses that create jobs through tax cuts and our programme of tax reform.

He added that the Chancellor had increased the tax-free personal allowance by £2,956, cut tax bills of 25 million people and had taken 2.2 million workers out of income tax altogether.

Mr Osborne also scrapped a planned fuel duty rise for this month.

Corporation tax will go down from 24p to 23p by April and will be cut by a further 2p by 2014.
