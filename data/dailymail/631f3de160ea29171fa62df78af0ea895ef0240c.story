Jurgen Klinsmann wants the chance to prove the accelerated development of football in the United States with a date against England at Wembley.

The Americans have played at Wembley twice, losing 2-0 in both games, in 1994 and 2008, but Klinsmann has helped the nation fall in love with the sport and his team’s impressive World Cup performance has fuelled the interest.

He brings his team to London next week for a friendly against Colombia, at Craven Cottage, when he hopes to further enhance this burgeoning reputation with English fans.

Jurgen Klinsmann has been USA team coach since 2011, and has massively improved the national side

‘A lot of people in England notice we are coming along,’ said Klinsmann. ‘They were full of compliments after the World Cup performance even though they were sad about their own team not going through to the knock-out stages.

‘The respect is growing on a global stage for the USA. They notice we can develop players and we can put good teams together. They notice the MLS is growing very fast and getting stronger and they see the national team taking the game to opponents as we will with Colombia. We want to beat them. It will be difficult but possible.

‘They see our results when we travel. They know it’s a nation that really takes sport seriously. That’s what people see in the UK. They give us respect. Hopefully we can get an opportunity soon to play against England at Wembley Stadium and prove it.’

USA made it to the knock-out stages of the World Cup in Brazil but were beaten by Belgium

The former Tottenham striker is excited about a return to London. ‘The city is just amazing, one of the most beautiful in the world, and soccer-driven,’ said the German coach, who led the United States into the last 16 of the World Cup, where they were beaten by Belgium in a tight game.

‘Getting out of the Group of Death was huge, and I still think we could have done better against Belgium,’ said Klinsmann, but he is demanding more consistency from some players he believes have suffered from a dip in form since their heroics in Brazil.

‘That’s something to improve. Our players have to become stronger to deal with the big moments and then go back into their clubs and play at the same standards. It takes professionalism to come out of a World Cup.

Klinsmann said he wants to prove how good his side are at Wembley against England 

‘Look at the best in the world – Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Thomas Muller – they come out of a World Cup, go through their preparation and show the same level as they did before. This is a lesson for us to learn. We can’t drop 30 or 40 per cent.’

The USA will also play in Dublin against the Republic of Ireland and Klinsmann paid tribute to Robbie Keane and the contribution he has made to the MLS since leaving Spurs for LA Galaxy in 2011.

‘Robbie is Ireland’s biggest ambassador in the MLS,’ said Klinsmann. ‘He is a special player. He always gives everything. His nature is never about how much money he can make. He still plays for the national team and flies back and forth. It is total dedication. Having a role model like him in this league is huge.’ 

Klinsmann, who played in London with Tottenham, said the city was 'beautiful', 'amazing' and 'soccer-driven'
