Billboards claiming iconic civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr was a Republican last week appeared in the black neighbourhoods of three Texas cities, angering local residents.

The advertising hoardings erected in Dallas, Houston and Austin by a conservative organisation to encourage African-Americans to 'Vote Republican!' have been branded 'disrespectful' by one Dallas resident.

The Democrats traditionally attract a far higher proportion of black voters than the Republican party.

'Disrespectful': Billboards claiming civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr was a Republican have appeared in the black neighbourhoods of Dallas, Houston and Austin

But Claver Kamau-Imani, the founder 
of RagingElephants.org, claims he has the documentation to prove Dr 
King, who was assassinated in 1968, voted Republican.

And he believes his billboards - 
which proclaim 'Martin Luther King Jr was a Republican. Vote Republican!
- will encourage other African-Americans to join the party.

He told CBS Dallas: 'The use of Dr 
King, because of him being an icon in the community, we feel would be 
most effective. That’s why we used it.

'We have the documentation to back the claims we’re making on the billboard.'

However, in 2008, Dr King’s son Martin Luther King III said: 'It is disingenuous to imply that my father was a Republican. He never endorsed any presidential candidate, and there is certainly no evidence that he ever even voted for a Republican.

'It is even more outrageous to suggest he would support the Republican Party of today, which has spent so much time and effort trying to suppress African-American votes in Florida and many other states.'

One local resident in Dallas, 
where the billboard has been put on Martin Luther King Jr Blvd, 
criticised the move as 'disrespectful'.

Aaron Carswell said: 'It’s a bit 
disrespectful for what Martin Luther King stood for, and who he was. To 
use his name in a political fashion, is a bit disrespectful.'

Amid the country's shifting 
demographics, Republicans have focused more on reaching out to Hispanics
than black voters, who have supported President Barack Obama in 
overwhelming numbers.

Black Republicans have long been 
scarce in Congress. Of 26 black Republican House members since 1870, the
vast majority served during the post-Civil War Reconstruction days.

In her bid to become the first black Republican woman elected to Congress, Mia Love is her party's face of diversity this campaign year

In her bid to become the first black 
Republican woman elected to Congress, Mia Love is her party's face of 
diversity this campaign year.

She is reluctant to embrace the role, saying she doesn't let race or gender define her politics.

'I was elected mayor not because of 
my race or gender, not because I wear high heels, but because of the 
policies I put in place,' Ms Love, 36, said in a recent interview.

Polling shows Ms Love with a slight lead over a six-term Democratic incumbent in Utah.

In a party that has struggled for 
decades to attract black voters, the daughter of Haitian immigrants 
included subtle nods to civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr and 
Rosa Parks in her speech to the Republican National Convention in 
August.

Ms Love's parents immigrated to the 
U.S. in the early 1970s. She says her father - who has worked as a 
painter, janitor and school bus driver - taught her never to ask for a 
handout. Her parents became U.S. citizens in 1984.

A married mother-of-three, a Mormon 
and a favourite of the small-government tea party movement, Ms Love is 
the only woman among 11 black Republican House candidates in the 
November 6 election.

Republicans have focused more on her conservative values and agenda than her race.

'We need a party that is diverse 
based on our issues and not based on simply trying to find greater 
variety in the complexion,' said Rep Tim Scott of South Carolina, one of
the two black Republicans now in the House.
