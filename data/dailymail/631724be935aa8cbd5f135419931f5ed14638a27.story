The 380-pound star of  My Big Fat Fabulous Life is filmed shopping for a bikini in the latest episode. 

Whitney Thore, 30, who became famous in 2014 when a YouTube video of her dancing went viral, hits the shops in preparation for her first beach trip in nearly 20 years.

The TLC reality star, who is a U.S. dress size 32, says on tonight’s show: ‘I have not really ever shown my legs, because they are really bumpy and cellulite-y and I don't really have knees anymore.'

Perfect fit: Whitney Thore, the 380-pound star of TLC's new reality series My Big Fat Fabulous Life, prepares for her first trip to the beach in nearly 20 years in a new episode that airs tonight

The first swimsuit Whitney tries is quite modest, with a full-length tank top and shorts.

'I like it, I do,' Whitney's friend Ashley assures her. 'I like the little tie on the side.' 

She adds: 'I have never seen Whitney in a bathing suit at all. I mean, I've seen Whitney naked, so I guess it's all relative.'

Wrong style: Whitney tells her friend Ashley (left) that she plans to be 'gallivanting' on the beach and thinks the swimsuit is too cumbersome

Honest friend: Ashley observes that Whitney is visibly sweating throughout the stressful shopping trip

She suggests that perhaps Whitney should try on the suit in a larger size, but Whitney reveals that she finds the suit's style cumbersome and wants to be able to move freely on the beach without having to adjust the fabric.

'I plan to by gallivanting,' she says. 'I just don't want to deal with this crap. I don't want to be the fat girl at the beach.' 

Ashley notes that the stressful situation is having a noticeable effect on her friend, observing: 'Whitney's trying on these bathing suits, and I'm kind of hoping that whoever buys them next washes them, because she looks like she's already been in the pool. She's so sweaty.

Two-piece: Finally, Whitney finds the perfect fit when she dons a black bikini, proclaiming that it 'just feels right'

Well-suited: 'I don't feel like I'm trying to cover myself up,' Whitney says of the bikini

'But I guess if you haven't put on a bathing suit in 19 years, some work goes into it,' Ashley adds.

Finally, Whitney finds the perfect fit when she dons a black bikini, proclaiming that it 'just feels right'.

'I don't feel like I'm trying to cover myself up,' she says.

'In all the other ones, I feel like I'm minimizing myself. And when I put on the bikini, all that falls away. It's just, "Here I am. This is me right now. Take it, leave it, love it, whatever!"'

My Big Fat Fabulous Life airs Tuesday at 10pm on TLC.
