Thousands of letters are being dumped or delivered late by Royal Mail’s doorstep rival.

Customers blame TNT Post for missed hospital appointments, lost bills and delayed medical test results.

The company’s orange-clad staff are paid according to how quick they are – giving them an incentive to ditch mail.

Letters have been found dumped in undergrowth in Manchester and London.

TNT Post began its delivery operations in west London in April 2012 and has expanded into other parts of the capital as well as to Manchester and Liverpool.

It hopes to reach 40 per cent of UK households within three years.

Unlike Royal Mail, which must deliver 93 per cent of first-class letters on the next working day, TNT Post is not subject to strict rules laid down by the industry regulator Ofcom.

One source said: ‘TNT Post can  literally do what it likes.’

To add to the  chaos, people who find letters dumped or wrongly delivered by TNT Post typically put them into a Royal Mail postbox.

Royal Mail will then levy a £1.53 surcharge – to the fury of recipients.

Clare Yabsley, a mother of two from Hammersmith, west London, says she missed two important hospital letters because of failings by TNT Post.

One related to her 20-month-old daughter Mia, who was born with a hole in her heart.

The 48-year-old knew something was amiss only when a letter arrived from Chelsea & Westminster Hospital asking why she had not turned up to an appointment.

She said: ‘When I phoned the hospital, which has been fantastic, they said it happens all the time.

‘It is such a waste of hospital appointments. If it has happened twice to me, how many other people has it happened to?’

On the other occasion a letter with medical test results failed to arrive with Mrs Yabsley having to rely on the copy later sent to her GP.

Susan Hall, leader of Harrow Council, had to apologise to residents following delays by TNT Post in delivering council tax notices.

It cost the London borough £13,000 to write to the 24,000 residents who had been affected by the payment date blunder.

Salford City Council, which also uses TNT Post, had similar difficulties with a council tax mailout to 110,000 homes because of a problem with a franking machine.

Chris Elsdale was walking her two dogs by the Welsh Harp Reservoir in Brent, north London, when she spotted a pile of around 250 letters under a bush.

Over the next 12 days, she telephoned TNT Post repeatedly – about eight or nine times – to urge them to come and pick up the mail. But the pile of letters remained where she had first spotted them.

She was told by one worker at TNT Post the bushes were too ‘thorny’ to tackle.

She became so frustrated she went into the bushes herself, put all the letters into a bag and called TNT Post again to pick them up, which they did.

Of the 250 items of mail, Mrs Elsdale said just ten were junk mail. The rest were from banks, energy companies, credit card providers and hospitals.

Mrs Elsdale, 55, a director of a photography business, said: ‘Each and every letter had an effect on somebody’s life.

‘You can’t leave personal bank details lying under a bush for 12 days.’

She said she felt ‘very strongly’ that a company which is entrusted to handle the post must have ‘a policy and procedure that sorts out what has gone wrong in  24 hours’.

TNT Post said it was ‘very grateful to Mrs Elsdale for working with us to get the issue resolved’.

A Royal Mail postman from Manchester 
said: ‘I constantly find mail sticking out of letter boxes and have to 
post it through to enable me to deliver our mail behind it. I see items 
of mail strewn in the street or thrown on doorsteps.

‘I see TNT postmen taking short cuts. I see them lost. I have them asking me directions and the whereabouts of certain streets.

‘All this astounds me and even saddens me as I have always taken pride in my own standards of service.

‘Worse still, there is the notion held by many of my customers that the decrease in service and standards is down to me.’

A TNT Post spokesman said: ‘We of course apologise for the disruption and distress caused by non-delivery of a letter by TNT Post.

‘However, sometimes human nature means that we cannot always live up to the standards we set ourselves and where there are issues with service quality, we will take the necessary action to resolve the issues to the satisfaction of our clients.’

Royal Mail lost its monopoly on all postal deliveries in January 2006. It quickly lost key business customers and now half of post is sorted by rival companies – before being delivered by Royal Mail on the so-called ‘final mile’.

But that doorstep job is now also being done by TNT Post, meaning households can have two deliveries a day.

TNT Post picks up letters from its client companies and sorts them before delivering them to their final destination. The company does not have its own post boxes. Royal Mail still has 115,500, which are most often used for social mail.
