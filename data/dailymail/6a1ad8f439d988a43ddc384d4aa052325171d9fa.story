Traditional seating on planes could soon be a thing of the past, after a design company unveiled a futuristic new concept.

London-based firm factorydesign have created a prototype model called Air Lair which features revolutionary single seat ‘cocoons’ stacked on top of one another.

The company were asked to design and create the model by Zodiac seats, a business that has supplied seating for airlines including British Airways.

The new design features a movable seat that can be positioned to lie flat or sit upright.

In addition, each pod has changeable mood lighting on the ceiling, a projector that can screen films onto a small overhead screen and individual iPod docks.

It means passengers are able to watch films lying on their backs.

Although there are currently no plans to install the design in any aircraft, Factorydesign's Director Adam White said that the concept would appeal to single travellers who did not want to interact with other passengers.

The ‘double-decker’ formation of the seats means that passengers get 30 percent more room that they would in traditional aircraft seats

‘Zodiac wanted us to create something outside the ordinary, something that would be new,’ he said.

‘But at the same time, we knew we wanted something that we felt had a genuine intelligence in terms of use of space.’

He denied that the seats would be difficult to get in and out of, comparing it to hopping into a large 4x4 vehicle, but admitted that they would not suit passengers with mobility issues.

Mr White’s fellow Director at Factory Design UK, Peter Tennent, added: ‘What at first may seem new, unfamiliar, awkward or unusual, soon becomes recognisable, appealing and normal, even expected.

‘This is why we move forward, not because we are driven necessarily to pursue change for the sake of change but that because, over time, what was once new becomes normal, so we press on looking for the next “new”.

‘The pursuit of “new” in the world of technology has accelerated exponentially over the last decade or two.

‘Competition is strong and there is routine investment in finding and flying the next and better passenger offer.

‘Our Air Lair has challenged the status quo, and yet are not so far removed from reality so as to be impossible.'
