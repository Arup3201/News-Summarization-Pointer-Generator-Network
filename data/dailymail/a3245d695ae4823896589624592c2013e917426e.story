Clutching their preserve jars, Tupperware boxes and cloth shopping bags, Berliners can now buy their groceries package-free, in a 'precycling' first for the environmentally switched-on city.

From ground Colombian coffee, to olive oil from Greece, biscuit wrappers and ready-made meal trays, the layers of packaging that consumers usually have to get through - and dispose of - are a thing of the past at 'Original Unverpackt' (Originally Unpackaged).

A pair of German women fed up with a packaging 'overdose' founded the store, which opened its doors in the cosmopolitan Kreuzberg district last week.

'Original Unverpackt' is Berlin's first packaging-free supermarket, and is a 'precycling' initiative

The Kreuzberg district store was set up by two German women, Milena Glimbovski, 24, and Sara Wolf, 31

Shoppers bring their own containers and can take as much or as little as they like of each food and drink. A customer pours pasta into a jar (left) and a barrel of red wine lies ready to be slowly emptied (right)

'It was important to act and to be part of the solution instead of just getting worked up about the predicted end of the world,' one of the co-founders Milena Glimbovski, 24, said.

Shoppers can buy the likes of muesli, rice and pasta by directly helping themselves from the large store containers, filling their own boxes before getting them weighed at the  till.

For beer and red wine, it's the same thing -'bring-your-own' bottles are just fine, while vodka is even stored in a big demijohn from which customers can buy a few shots, or more.

When customers are done, they bring their containers of food up to the tills to be weighed

The forward-thinking shop has a very 'old school' feel, but is very much a progressive initiative

The store also sells washing up liquid and toiletries in bulk, with shoppers helping themselves to  shampoo using the tap on a 10-litre (2.6-gallon) tin, while toothpaste comes in tablet form.

The shop's lay-out and decor make you almost expect an old-fashioned storekeeper in a striped apron and with a pencil behind his ear to appear.

But its mission is all about forward thinking, by encouraging 'precycling', a preventive form of environmentalism, as opposed to just recycling already used packaging, Sara Wolf, 31, the other co-founder, said.

Shampoo comes in huge vats, which can then be siphoned into smaller containers by customers

Toothpaste is even bought in tablets, so that there is none wasted and no packaging to throw away

Germans throw away an average of 16 million tonnes of rubbish a year, the Federal Environment Agency says

Germans throw away 16 million tonnes on average of rubbish a year, according to the Federal Environment Agency.

Three-quarters of the rubbish found in the ocean is made up of plastic bags and packaging, as well as cigarette lighters and toothbrushes, and takes up to 400 years to disintegrate,  environmental group WWF says.

Customers seemed taken with the Berlin store.

'Our society worries far too little about the problem of plastics,' complained Kathrin Puzia, a shopper in her 40s, who said she planned to get her groceries at the new shop 'from time to time'.

Another customer, Lisa Specht, said she's been buying organic aubergines out of concern for the environment but questioned the benefit when they were still packaged.

There are just a few packaging-free shops in Europe, including two in Italy, one in France and one in Vienna

'Each one was wrapped in plastic film. Where's the ecological gain?' she asked.

While jumbo size is often the order of the day at big supermarkets, with shoppers' trolleys full to brimming, Original Unverpackt allows customers to buy far smaller quantities to avoid waste.

Valentin Thurn, a writer and director, who made the 2010 German documentary 'Taste the Waste', said the food industry played on consumers' feelings to get them to buy.

'Seventy percent of our purchases are spontaneous decisions where the packaging's importance is going to have something reassuring or exciting, for example, to push us to buy,' he said at the shop's launch.

The package-free Berlin shop is among a handful in Europe, but the trend is still in its infancy, with two in Italy, one in Bordeaux in south west France and one in the Austrian capital, Vienna.

It currently seems difficult to imagine big supermarkets following suit.

Marie Delaperierre, who opened Germany's first no-packaging shop in the northern city of Kiel at the start of the year, believes the key is to simply meet local people's daily needs.

'This concept must remain a small neighbourhood shop to fulfil daily needs, such as "I need 150 grammes of maize to make some popcorn",' she said.
