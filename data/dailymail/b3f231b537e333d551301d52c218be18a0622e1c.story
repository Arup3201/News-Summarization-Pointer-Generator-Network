Confusion reigns on the first day of the Labour party conference as Ed Miliband faced further questions about his ability to win the next election.

Two years after Ed Miliband was named Labour leader in Manchester, the party is back in the city and still publicly confused about who is in charge.

And shadow chancellor Ed Balls is embroiled in a football controversy over claims he deliberately dived to secure a penalty in a match against journalists.

The Labour XI were 2-0 up when Mr Balls made a break down the wing and was clipped by a journalists.

After apparently taking time to consider his options, the shadow chancellor fell to the ground.

One onlooker said: ‘I have never seen anyone go down so slowly and dramatically in my life.’

The move secured a penalty, which Mr Balls slotted home. The final scoreline was 3-0.

Even colleague Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, said the penalty was ‘questionable’.

Later Mr Balls was at pains to stress it was not ‘one of my goals’ to become Labour leader.

He told Huffington Post: ‘If I’m honest for you, personally, it doesn’t matter, I actually don’t care, it’s not something which I think about, worry about care about at all whether I’m leader of prime minister, it’s not part of my mindset, its not part of my goals.

‘If I say to you I rule it out, I don’t think you’d believe me. If I say to you it’s very unlikely, I think that’s totally honest, I don’t care. I don’t give a toss. I really don’t give a toss.”

Yet the question of the Labour leadership continued to dominate.

David Miliband, who was defeated by his brother Ed, appeared to suggest that the public would prefer him in charge.

Asked about a poll commissioned by the Conservatives which found three quarters of voters think David would make a better leader, he replied: ‘The most important thing to remember is that the grass always seems greener on the other side of the fence.’

To add to the sense of 
confusion, Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman went on Sky News to 
rail against the Prime Minister David Cameron, and declared: ‘If you're 
completely out of touch like David Miliband is you cannot make the right
decisions.’

After being corrected by reporter Joey Jones, Ms Harman exclaimed: ‘Oh goodness me’ before launching back into her soundbite.

Earlier speeches from the platform left many in the conference hall underwhelmed or distracted.

Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle was spotted taking pictures of her sister Angela during her speech.

And during shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper's speech left her coleagues struggling to stay awake.

Chris Bryant, shadow immigration minister was spotted yawning, while Diane Abbott, the shadow health minister, and Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, spent the speech checking their phones.

The first day of the Labour party has been dominated by gossip and gaffes about who is in charge

Later this week Ed Miliband is expected to put the stamp on his leadership with a party political broadcast which chronicles his upbringing and contrasts with privately-educated Tories.

It includes footage from his childhood and teaching students at Harvard where he is repeatedly called ‘Professor Miliband’.
