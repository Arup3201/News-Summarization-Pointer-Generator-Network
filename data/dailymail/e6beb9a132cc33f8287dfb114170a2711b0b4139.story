It looks like an underwater tornado - but these divers are actually swimming in the middle of a huge school of fish.

The fish swarmed around Mika Woyda in their thousands as she swam off the coast of Cabo Pulmo, Mexico.

Her husband Caine Delacy snapped the breath-taking images of Mika in scenes he revealed he had never witnessed in 20 years of diving.
