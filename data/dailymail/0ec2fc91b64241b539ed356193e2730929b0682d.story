A woman has been sentenced for up to two years in prison for escaping prison by impersonating another inmate. 

Evelyn Grace Campbell, 29, from Uniontown, Pennsylvania, fooled jail guards and a bail bondsman at Fayette County prison into believing she was another prisoner with a similar sounding name. 

She left the prison and the mix-up wasn't noticed until the next day. 

Campbell - who was serving a six month sentence for retail theft - signed herself out of the prison on June 6 when a bondsman showed up to post $500 bail on behalf of another inmate, Maretta Gambel.

The warden says Campbell stepped forward when guards called for Gambel. 

She then escaped after telling the bail bondsman she didn't have identification before he let her sign the release papers.

Warden Brian Miller said the guards and bail bondsman should have had photos of both women.

Campbell left the prison and the mistake was not noticed until 7am the next morning. She turned herself in at 3pm the same day.

She was charged with forgery and identify theft and had a new $30,000 bail set.

On Wednesday, she was sentenced to a maximum of two years in prison.  

Police said Campbell is not 'dangerous' but 'elusive' and has a history of running from police.
