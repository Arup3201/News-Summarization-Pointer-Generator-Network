Four-time Olympic rowing gold medalist Matthew Pinsent discovered that watching lawn bowls isn’t quite as relaxing as it would appear.

Pinsent didn’t hold back in venting his frustration on Twitter over the look of the bowls: ‘How complicated would it be to have bowls a totally different colour? — Hard to tell the ENG blue from the SCO … err .. blue. #bowlsrage’.

Maybe stick to the rowing, Matthew.

Home nations' seven sins

England, Scotland and Wales were all knocked out of the rugby sevens on Sunday.

England suffered a narrow 15-14 defeat to Samoa, while Scotland were dispatched by South Africa 35-12 and Australia inflicted late heartbreak on Wales by bagging a converted try in the last minute, which took the final score to 21-19.

Boxing supporters were treated to a good chuckle during the flyweight bout between Uganda’s Rogers Semitala and Anurudha Rathnayake of Sri Lanka on Sunday.

The pair were only 15 seconds into the first round at the SECC precinct when a frantic exchange of punches culminated in Semitala’s glove flying off his hand on to the canvas after he failed to connect with a wild right hook.

Armitstead in crash scare

England’s Lizzie Armitstead crashed in Paris on Sunday on the last lap of the women’s stage of the Tour de France called La Course.

She is one of the favourites for the Commonwealth Games road race title and reports suggest she is not seriously injured after she tangled with France’s Pauline Ferrand-Prevot with a kilometre to go. She is expected to be fine for Glasgow.

'X' marks spot for Sarah's gold

Scottish judo star Sarah Adlington lost her gold medal on Saturday night, and quickly launched a search mission.

She realised she didn’t have her new prized possession when she sat down for dinner at the athletes’ village, and initially thought she was the victim of a prank.

The 27-year-old went to the security entrance and staff started searching for the prized medal. 'They eventually found it stuck in the X-ray machine,’ Adlington said.

Nat bowled over

Defending champion Natalie Melmore could only manage a silver for England in the bowls final.

Melmore lost 21-15 to New Zealand’s Jo Edwards. ‘Obviously it’s disappointing but Jo played brilliantly and I can’t take it away from her,’ she said.

England's Bethany Woodward had the honour of opening proceedings at Hampden Park on Sunday.

The 21-year-old achieved a lifetime best of four metres and duly won the silver medal in the F37/38 long jump — all this despite posting a foul in the first round.

Keen viewers may recognise Woodward from London 2012, where she won silver in the T37 100m and Bronze in the T35/38 4x100m relay.

Shambles of the squash score

England team-mates Peter Barker and Nick Matthew faced off in the men’s singles squash semi-final, but the BBC’s ambiguous scoreboard meant viewers had a trouble telling who waswinning.

Just to confuse matters more, Baker was wearing the shirt of another team-mate Daryl Selby to avoid a colour clash. It didn’t do him any favours, though — he lost without winning a game.
