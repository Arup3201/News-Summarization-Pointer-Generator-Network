Everton manager Roberto Martinez has dismissed a potential surprise move from Liverpool for England starlet Ross Barkley.

The 20-year-old playmaker has made an explosive entrance on to the Premier League stage this season under Martinez's guidance, and scored a goal-of-the-season contender at Newcastle last month.

Barkley's Everton exploits have attracted interest from Manchester United, but city rivals Liverpool are now prepared to smash their transfer record to land the youngster, according to reports in the Daily Star.

Hands off: Ross Barkley will not be leaving Everton any time soon, says Roberto Martinez

But Martinez is not willing to entertain any bids for Barkley, and laughed off a potential bid from Brendan Rodgers' title chasers as well as from Old Trafford.

And the Spaniard insisted he welcomes bids for his players, because it proves they are performing at a high level.

'In terms of speculation, we already turned down a £50m bid from (Manchester) United so we're not going to take £38m from Liverpool,' Martinez said at a press conference on Tuesday.

'It's quite enjoyable to speak about speculation because it shows how well our players are doing. That's the type of football compliments we want.'

Martinez also dismissed the possibility of defender John Stones leaving the club this summer.

As revealed by Sportsmail on Monday, Chelsea have joined Arsenal in the race for the 19-year-old defender, but both clubs clearly face a difficult task prising him away.

Martinez insisted he did not know 
about the interest in Stones, who was a £3m buy from Barnsley in 
January 2013 and is being tipped as an outsider for England's World Cup 
squad after a series of increasingly impressive displays this season.

'No, I haven't heard about (that),' said Martinez. 'We won't send players on loan either.

'It's a good sign. It's not bad for a young man who's just beginning his career.'

He added: 'Stones has been phenomenal.'

No thanks: Espanol forward Sergio Garcia is not on Everton's wishlist, insists Martinez

Martinez also rejected suggestions of interest in Espanyol forward Sergio Garcia, and said that, while he expects to bring in players this summer, he will be looking to bring through more academy graduates, such as Barkley.

'We're well in advance in the search for talent and characters who can help our dressing room,' he said. 'We always do that from (transfer) window to window. But the names coming up are far away from our targets.

'Recruitment is underway behind the scenes. The biggest source of recruitment is at home. The academy excites me.'
