Niko Kranjcar bounced back from two brutal tackles to spoil Mark Hughes’s homecoming party.

The Croatian, who Harry Redknapp loves so much he’s signed him four times, embedded himself further in the manager’s affections with an 88th minute equaliser.

It will be viewed as a point won for QPR but two points lost for Stoke who led twice and had opportunities to seal victory.

Referee: Martin Atkinson.

Redknapp was full of admiration as he revealed the 30-year-old took a ‘massive pay cut’ to come back to West London, where he also spent last season on loan.

Kranjcar, who played under Redknapp at Portsmouth and Tottenham, is thought to have sacrificed £6million in wages over two years from Dynamo Kiev.

‘He took a massive cut in wages,’ said Redknapp. ‘We pay a third of what he was earning in Ukraine. He had a massive, fantastic contract in Russia and he just wanted to come back here and play football. It’s very rare to see a boy do that.’

There was a sense of justice in Kranjcar’s goal after he was twice brutally and illegally felled, first by Ryan Shawcross, then by Steve Sidwell, whose lunging challenge resulted in a free kick just outside the Stoke area — prime Kranjcar territory. The midfielder, who had come close from range several times, fired into the top right corner.

‘He scores those in training all the time,’ said Redknapp, ‘He’s a class player and it was a great free kick after two bad challenges. He punished them.’

There was a sense of justice in the goal for Kranjcar who was twice bullied to the deck, first by a bruising Ryan Shawcross tackle, then an illegal Steve Sidwell challenge which resulted in a free kick from 20-yards, prime Kranjcar territory. 

Both Crouch and Charlie Adam attempted to clear Steven Caulker's header but, ultimately, the poor communication led to Crouch poking it into his own net

The striker, who had come close from range several times, fired it into the top right corner. Harry Redknapp burst out of his dugout in celebration leaving a stony faced Hughes to rue what could have been.

After pulling off an extraordinary victory at Manchester City earlier this season, Hughes was vying to do the double over his former clubs by winning at Loftus Road.

It was an intimidating atmosphere for the 50 year old, returning for the first time since being sacked by owner Tony Fernandes in 2012. Some QPR fans perceive the financial and confidence problems the club currently faces as being a hangover from Hughes's 10 month stint here. 

The game was just two minutes old when chants of ‘stand up if you hate Mark Hughes’ echoed round the loveable old ground. He nearly had the last laugh through goals from Mame Biram Diouf and Peter Crouch.

Crouch showed he is defying the calendar better than Rio Ferdinand, who was not as incisive in defence as he is in his recent acerbic autobiography.

The 33-year-old striker, not known for his searing speed, outsprinted his former England teammate and minutes later controversially used him as a climbing ladder to assist the opening goal. Victor Moses employed what Ferdinand might call silky skills to wrong foot Mauricio Isla and send his cross arching into the box. Crouch flicked the ball on for Diouf to head home from six yards out.

Moses, who wreaked havoc down the wing, set up Crouch with a peach of an opportunity to extend Stoke’s on the half hour mark but his long limbs got in the way and he could not get his shot on target.

QPR had the majority of possession in the opening 20 minutes but lacked the nous to make the most of it. Their most significant chance was Kranjcar’s sweet left footed shot from 28 yards out which whistled over the crossbar.

Their breakthrough came on 42mins when Crouch helped Steven Caulker’s goal into the top corner of the net, getting in the way of teammate Charlie Adam who was poised to make a goal line clearance. QPR’s two new imports from Cardiff teamed up for their goal. Caulker, bought from Cardiff for £8m this summer, got on the end of a cross from Jordon Mutch, heading towards the bottom right corner from close range.

Moses was again on point for the second goal, opening up the QPR defence like his biblical namesake parted the red sea. The Nigeria international shrugged off Isla and his pinpoint cross found Crouch, unmarked in the box and able to direct into the goal with his right foot.

Stoke, who hold the unwanted record of being the team last on Match Of The Day the highest number of times, did everything to ensure a shake up in the running order, with exciting counter-attacking football and QPR contributed with persistent attacking. 

‘The overriding emotion is disappointment,’ said former QPR boss Hughes. ‘We allowed them back into the game and it should have already been too far away from them.’

Despite a questionable record that has seen QPR relegated once before under Harry Redknapp, the R's manager revealed he was likely to sign a new contract soon
