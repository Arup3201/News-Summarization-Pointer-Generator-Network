A heartbroken mother has demanded that her ex-husband sends her two sons back to Britain after he took them to Russia and refused to return them, in defiance of a court order.

Rachael Neustadt, 35, allowed Daniel, seven, and Jonathan, five, to go to Moscow with their father for Christmas but they have not been allowed home.

Now Ms Neustadt has turned to a Russian court and asked them to intervene in the international tug of love.

The English High Court have said Ilya Neustadt, 36, a former London Metropolitan University lecturer, must bring his two sons back to Britain.

But he has refused to comply with the court order, and solicitors for Ms Neustadt, an American who lives in London, have applied direct to the Russian courts for help.

They are using a piece of international law governing cross-border disputes between parents which was ratified by the Russians less than two months ago.

Ms Neustadt hopes that the orders made in the High Court will be 'enforced' in Russia under the international convention.

Her solicitors Dawson Cornwell revealed details of the abduction after Deputy High Court Judge Alison Russell gave the mother permission to publicise the case.

Ms Neustadt also has a third son with her ex-husband, one-year-old Meir, who remains in London with her.

Family split up: Daniel, seven, (left) and Jonathan, five, (centre) went to Russia for Christmas with their father but have not been allowed to return. They are currently separated from their one-year-old brother Meir (right)

She said in a statement released through her solicitors that she is desperate to get her children back.

'I just want the boys back home here safe 
and sound - and soon. I'm deeply concerned that the current situation is
damaging and harmful to the children and to the family bond, especially
because of the absence of a relationship between the boys and me, their
mummy.

Order: Ilya Neustadt, 36, who has defied demands to return his two sons to England

'I love and miss them so much and I know they are missing me and 
their baby brother too.'

A spokesman for the law firm said: 'Rachael had only agreed to the children going on a holiday with their father to Russia to visit his family over the school Christmas break.

'Ilya was to bring the children back to England in time for the new school term. As a result of the abduction, the children are now completely separated from their mother, who has always been their primary carer, and from their younger brother.

'The children are now Wards of the English High Court and the Court has ordered that Ilya must return the children to England. Ilya has ignored all of the High Court orders and refuses to engage in the proceedings.

'When Rachael confronted her former husband about his actions in splitting up their three children, keeping the siblings apart, and keeping the children away from their mother, Ilya replied with what he referred to as the "two-thirds speech" in that, when the Berlin Wall was built, it may have been "unfortunate" to give up one third of the city, but "at least two-thirds was saved".'

Ms Neustadt has travelled to Russia three times in an attempt to get her ex-husband to hand over Daniel and Jonathan, but he has refused.

The spokesman added: 'Rachael has had very little contact with the children despite her visits to Russia. On Rachael's most recent trip to Russia, Ilya denied her contact with the children and refused to inform the children that their mother was in Moscow.

'On the one occasion when Ilya permitted the children to briefly speak to their mother on the telephone, Daniel asked his father if he could see his mother, but then returned to the phone to tell his mother that he could not because his father says,Â  "it is forbidden".

'Ilya has prevented regular telephone and Skype contact from taking place between the children and their mother and has also recently told Rachael that: "I am their mother now! I am mother and I am father!'''

The spokesman added that Ms Neustadt was pinning her hopes on the Russian court directly enforcing the order made by the English High Court.

Lawyer Carolina Marin Pedreno, of Dawson Cornwell, said: 'There are thousands of tragedies of abduction that occur each year because a parent wrongfully retains a child whilst abroad.

'We are hopeful that the Russian courts will adopt a swift and just approach in the matter, and that our client's Hague application will be successful in the return of the children to this jurisdiction.'
