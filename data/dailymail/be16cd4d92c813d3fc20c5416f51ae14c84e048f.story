With £3,500, a family of four could spend a fortnight relaxing in Disney World Florida or perhaps a week being pampered at a five-star hotel on the Costa del Sol.

But, if they would rather stick close to home – and can find ten friends to bring along – they could fork out the princely sum for a week in Meadowgate – Kirstie Allsopp’s renovated Devon bolthole.

One of the country’s most famous homemakers, known for her love of traditional arts and crafts, Miss Allsopp, 42, has opened the doors to the home she made famous in the show Kirstie’s Homemade Home.

Kirstie Allsopp's Devon holiday home, Meadowgate, which holidaymakers can now rent out for £3,500 per week through the firm Classic Cottages

The dining room of Kirstie Allsopp's Meadowgate home in Devon, which featured on the show 'Kirstie's Homemade Home. The TV presenter spent £150,000 transforming the home after it lay empty for 39 years

The property's kitchen comes complete with a huge table for dining as well as an Aga oven. Miss Allsopp bought the mansion for £300,000 in 2008

In Kirstie's Homemade Home, the presenter spent £150,000 bringing new life to the property, using reclaimed and recycled furniture throughout the house, including in the sitting room, pictured, wherever possible

Her current programme, Kirstie's Fill Your House For Free, advocates the idea of reusing and repurposing items and, true to her word, it seems to be an ethos she has kept alive throughout Meadowgate

With its warm wooden floors and ‘cosy’ cluttered rooms, the house embodies the outspoken presenter’s DIY ethos.

With the money from her successful TV career, some people might have suspected that away from the camera Miss Allsopp’s upcycling credentials would fall away – not so at Meadowgate.

From the seemingly homemade spreads strewn around the house, to the gold and black wallpaper – designed by the Location, Location, Location star herself – in the downstairs bathroom, her taste on and off screen appears to remain the same.

Perched in Welcombe’s rugged landscape, classed as an area of outstanding beauty, the house – complete with games room and annexe – is just a short stroll from the National Trust beach of Welcombe Mouth and only a mile from the nearest pub – although it’s a five mile trek to the shop.

The six-bedroom property – it can sleep up to 14 – fetches £3,402-a-week during the peak summer holiday period but can go for as little as £1,875 in less busy months. It has previously only been available for longer summer lets but is now available for shorter periods though Classic Cottages.

Finished off with quirky touches – see the rowing boat in the middle of the garden, a bath in the master bedroom and gold WOW lettering on a wall – the transformation from wreck to dream family home was chronicled in the 2009 TV show.

The mansion has six bedrooms, including this master bedroom and sleeps up to 14 people. The TV presenter often stays at the Devon home with her family

Visitors to Meadowgate can enjoy Sky television and parking for four cars but while dogs are welcome, smokers are not

The mansion has views such as this from the twin bedroom of the rugged landscape and is just a short stroll from the National Trust beach of Welcombe

Before Miss Allsopp bought Meadowgate in 2008, for £300,000, it had been empty for 39 years and was in a shocking state of disrepair. Now, however, she often stays there with her partner, developer Ben Andresen, 55, their sons Bay, 8, and Oscar, 6 and Mr Andersen’s two sons from a previous marriage, Hal, 14, and Orion, 11.

In Kirstie’s Homemade Home, the presenter spent £150,000 bringing new life to the property, using reclaimed and recycled furniture and fittings wherever possible.

Her current programme, Kirstie’s Fill Your House For Free, advocates the idea of reusing and repurposing items and, true to her word, it seems to be an ethos she has kept alive throughout Meadowgate, with its mismatched crockery and thrown-together feel.

Visitors can enjoy Sky television and parking for four cars but while dogs are welcome, smokers are not. The price includes electricity, heating and one basket of logs for the fire but any basket after that comes at an extra cost.

Some preliminary reservations to let the home, which also features a special room for children, have been made up to two years in advance

Mary Harlow, operations manager for Classic Cottages who let the property describes it as perfect for a family holiday as it is right by the beach. But if the weather isn't great, holidaymakers could always use the property's games room, pictured

Mary Harlow, operations manager for Classic Cottages, said the company have had the home on their books for five years, taking it on shortly after Miss Allsopp bought it.

She said there has been ‘good but static’ interest from renters throughout that period, with some preliminary reservations coming in as far as two years in advance.

Miss Harlow believes the celebrity factor has some part to play I this success, saying: ‘I think obviously the fact that it’s [Miss Allsopp’s] has some attraction but it’s also a big family home and right by the beach, so perfect for a family holiday’.
