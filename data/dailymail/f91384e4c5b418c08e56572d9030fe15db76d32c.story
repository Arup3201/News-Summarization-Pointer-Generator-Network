A new piece of stencilled graffiti, possibly by Banksy, has appeared overnight on the wall of a Poundland shop in London.

It shows a young Asian boy hunched over a sewing machine with real Union Flag bunting attached - and given the artist's controversial past works, it could be a dark reflection on the imminent Olympics or the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

However, as the pictures below show, someone later removed the bunting, which had been attached high across the wall.

Residents near Turnpike Lane in Haringey, north London, noticed the artwork this morning on the side of the nearby bargain store - which sells similar bunting - and has itself been at the centre of controversy.

Now you see it...

Two years ago, Poundland launched an inquiry after a boy of seven was found to be working 100 hours a week in an Indian sweatshop producing goods for the store (file photo)

Two years ago, Poundland launched an inquiry after a boy of seven was found to be working 100 hours a week in an Indian sweatshop producing goods for the store.

The child, known as Ravi, was reportedly earning just 7p a hour to make napkin rings for the cut-price chain.

The company severed ties with the supplier and issued a statement saying it 'did not tolerate child labour under any circumstances'.

All Banksy works can be found on his official website but, as this is not yet the case with the latest piece, it is unknown whether the artist created it.

The artist, who has amassed a fortune selling his work at auction, appeared to have secretly painted the wall in the early hours of yesterday morning with the help of two collaborators.

Holly-Jade Leathers, 14, who lives on the road, told the Evening Standard: 'I came down here at about four in the morning and there were three guys who looked homeless with their backs to the wall.

In July 2010, Poundland launched an inquiry into the 'Indian sweatshop' claims concerning Ravi.

The boy was found to be working and sleeping in the factory in Delhi.

His ‘wages’ of under £7 a week were sent to his widowed mother in a poverty-stricken rural village hundreds of miles away in the east­ern state of Bihar.

The cheap trinkets he decorated were bought by Trishulin Overseas, a Delhi company which supplied the cut-price chain.

The bargain store was founded by Britons Dave Dodd and Stephen Smith in 1990, but was sold in May 2010 to U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus for £200million.

Poundland has more than 250 outlets across Britain, and employs about 7,000 people.

The company confirmed at the time that it had placed orders with Trishulin, but said it was a new sup­plier and they had not yet received any of the goods.

‘Poundland does not tolerate child labour under any circum­stances and will not work with companies that employ children,’ a spokesman said.

'They must have been painting it on the wall somehow because I came back past at six o’clock and it was there in the exact same spot.'

Excited locals gathered round to take photos of the artwork, which could b e worth thousands of pounds.

Saqib Khalid, 16, who lives nearby, told the paper: 'It’s inspiring to see graffiti on the streets of London which is actually good art and not vandalism.'

James Longshaw, 42, who works in new media, said: 'It’s a work of art, so of course I enjoy it. It will probably put house prices up in the area – that’s what has happened in areas where he has been before.

'I don’t see why anyone should object - all it means is the area has arrived. He isn’t attacking the area, he is attacking businesses in the area which exploit people in sweatshops.

'Banksy is promoting an issue by painting this but I don’t think a lot of people will know what it means – they might think it is just any graffiti.'

In the past, graffiti by the elusive artist has caused house prices to skyrocket. 

In 2008, a Portobello Road wall adorned with his name fetched £200,000 on eBay.

His work is known for its strident anti-establishment message, which has done nothing to damage his popularity among celebrities and the super-rich – his 2010 film Exit Through The Gift Shop was nominated for an Oscar.

Banksy’s famous work includes a vandalised phone box crumpled in half with a pickaxe in its side.

He once climbed into the penguin enclosure at London Zoo and painted 'We’re bored of fish' in 7ft high letters.

At the 2004 Notting Hill Carnival, the prankster handed out spoof British £10 notes substituting the picture of the Queen’s head with Diana, Princess of Wales head and changing the text 'Bank of England' to 'Banksy of England'.

The mystery of Banksy the prankster

Banksy is perhaps the most famous, or 
infamous, artist alive. To some a genius, to others a vandal.

Always 
controversial, he inspires admiration and provokes outrage in equal 
measure.

Since making his name with his 
trademark art in public spaces - on walls in 
London, Brighton, Bristol and even on the West Bank barrier separating 
Israelis and Palestinians - his works have sold for hundreds of 
thousands of pounds.

He is also known for his headline-making
stunts, such as leaving an inflatable doll dressed as a Guantanamo 
prisoner in Disneyland, California, and hanging a version of the Mona 
Lisa - but with a smiley face - in the Louvre, Paris.

And as the value of his work rocketed – 
Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are collectors – an urban myth emerged that
Banksy was a talented tearaway from an underprivileged background on an
inner-city estate.

For years, he dumbfounded the art 
world by keeping his identity a secret.

But four years ago The Mail on 
Sunday is believed to have finally unmasked Banksy as Robin Gunningham, a
former public schoolboy who grew up in middle-class suburbia.

According to a source close to the artist, Mr Gunningham, understood to be 37, 'lives [with his wife] in an isolated community'.
