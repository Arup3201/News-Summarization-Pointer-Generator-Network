A family of rabbits are believed to be responsible for unearthing an 8,000-year-old archaeological 'gold mine' near Land's End.

A haul of Stone Age arrow heads and flint tools found in a freshly dug network of rabbit warrens less than 200 yards from the Cornish landmark has led archaeologists to plan a full excavation of the site.

Although a formal dig of the 150-acre area is yet to begin, initial analysis suggests there could be a large Neolithic cemetery, Bronze Age burial mounds and an Iron Age hill fort buried there.

Artifacts: Among the items brought to the surface by the family of rabbits were these Neolithic flint tools

Land's End has long been considered an area of historical interest as the spectacular views have led to a disproportionately large number of important people being buried there over several thousand years.

Although there are a number of important archeological sites in the local area, the latest Land's End dig will almost certainly be the first prompted by a family of rabbits.

The excavation of the site will be managed by a team from Wirral-based archaeologists Big Heritage.

Team leader Dean Paton, 30, told the 
Mirror: 'It seems important people have been buried here for thousands 
of years - probably because of the stunning views. [But] it's a 
million-to-one chance rabbits should make such an astounding find.'

Mr Paton says the rabbits dug two small burrows right next to each, dragging a number of historical artifacts to the surface as they did so.

He added: 'No one knows the scale of it, but it's a gold mine. A family of rabbits has just rewritten the history books.'

Big Heritage now plan to spend the next two years excavating the site.
