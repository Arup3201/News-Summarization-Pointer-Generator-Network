The Pentagon, with help from Apple product designers at Frog Design and Hollywood illustrators, has developed a mapping-style 'game' prototype that could be used to launch cyberattacks at the click of a button.

Dubbed 'War of Cyberwarcraft' the system uses Samsung touch table technology to control network topologies - or a group of connected nodes - that look like 'constellations of stars'.

Military strategists can press a node to open a drop-down menu that lets them visualise all possible attack scenarios and choose exactly how and where to send the attack.

What Project X could look like: an early prototype of the interconnected maps that future cyber-warriors will use to prevent cyberattacks. This isn't exactly what the prototype looks like because Darpa is keeping the design a secret for security reasons. The prototype includes red 'target' nodes as well as 'weapon packages' and 'battle unit' nodes

Using a Samsung 
SUR40 touch table, the mission name is shown in 
the top right-hand corner of the screen along with a red star showing 
the attack target.

Below it is a network of connected nodes.

Tapping on the red 'target' star causes blue wedges to pop up around it, with 
icons such as lightning bolts or disks, as well as a 
number.

These numbers correspond to 'weapon packages' each containing different types of weapons, with 
different costs and risks associated with them. 

Strategists can then pick battle units that detail the method of the intended attack. 

Other battle units can be selected to track how the mission is going, and strategists can change course if need be.

As each node is selected, new 
routes appear along the network and become more detailed.

A prototype of the system was exclusively revealed to Noah Schachtman from Wired magazine by Dan Roelker, a cybersecurity 
specialist who has been developing Plan X.

He told Schachtman: 'Say you’re playing World of Warcraft, and you’ve got this type of sword, +5 or whatever.

'You don’t necessarily know what spells were used to create that sword, right?

'You just know it has these attributes and it helps you in this way.

'It’s the same type of concept. You don’t need the technical details.'

Using a Samsung SUR40 touch table, Roelker explained that the mission name is shown in the top right-hand corner of the screen along with a red star showing the target, which in this instance was the botnet's server.

Roelker taps on this red 'server' star and four blue wedges pop up around it, with icons such as lightning bolts or disks, as well as a number.

These numbers are 'weapon packages' each containing different types of weapons, with different costs and risks associated with them.

The team behind Plan X use a Samsung SUR40 touch table to manipulate the network topology. As each node is pressed, menu options appear. As more options are selected, more nodes appear and the more intricate the choices become. Strategists will be able to map out entire cyberattack scenarios using the system, weighing up cost and risk, before an attack is launched

Roelker continued: 'Maybe some technologies were more expensive to develop. Maybe it’s more risky or controversial.

'Maybe we spent $5 million building X, and if we use it, there’s a 50% chance we might lose it.'

Although he adds that the numbers are meaningless on the prototype, they’re meant to convey each cyberattack has a different cost associated with it.

During the demonstration, Roelker picked a weapon package called Sonic Boom, which cost him 10 points.

He then picked from a list 'battle units'.

Wired explained that these could potentially include downloading rootkits or launching a denial of service attack, although Roelker was reluctant to use these specific terms.

Other units could measure how successful the mission is and as Roelker selected nodes, new routes along the network appeared and became more detailed.

The Pentagon announced Darpa was working on Plan X in October last year, in a bid to upgrade its military force to be better prepared to fight in the digital age. At the time Darpa appealed for help from labs, universities and computer-game programmers to help create a team of cyber warriors. It was the first time the US government had sought outside support for its cyber strategies

The Pentagon announced that Darpa was working on Plan X in October last year, in a bid to upgrade its military force to be better prepared to fight
in the digital age.

At the time Darpa appealed for help from labs, 
universities and computer-game programmers to help develop these new cyber technologies.

It was the first time the US government had sought outside support for its cyber strategies, and was hoping it would work in a similar way to its other military contracts.

For example, Lockheed Martin holds contracts with the military
 to build conventional weapons.

The Defense 
Department was quick to add that Plan X would not fund the development of 
cyberweapons, but instead it would work to create tools to make existing ones more 
effective.

Experts claimed that this would range from taking
 out power grids to disabling a pacemaker in an enemy combatant.

Brave New World: The Pentagon's project titled 'Plan X' was launched in October 2012. It hopes to improve the US military's ability to wage cyberwars and prevent cyberattacks

The program hopes the
development of new technologies will allow the military to 
'dominate the cyber battlespace,' while simultaneously implementing a 
clearer
strategy for using cyberattacks.

Plan X has already received $110 million in funding for the
next five years, which it hopes to dole out in military contracts to researchers
around the country.

'If they can do it, it’s a really big deal,' 
Herbert S. Lin, a cybersecurity expert with the National research Council told
the Washington Post.

‘If they achieve it, they’re talking about being able to
dominate the digital battlefield just like they do the traditional battlefield.'

One of the main priorities for Plan X was creating this comprehensive, visual map that plots out the digital locations of tens of billions of computers around the world.

Outside Help: The military is offering contracts to the private sector to encourage the development of new technology. Frog Design and illustrators from the Transformer films have already joined the team

This can be used to identify and target hostile servers and networks that they could then disable.

They
 also hope to create a stronger operating system that will allow for 
quicker attacks, while also making computers at home less susceptible to
 foreign attacks.

Officials told the 
Washington Post that they hope this new system will look like an armored
 truck when compared to the SUV that is existing computer operating 
systems.

Plan X also hopes to set guidelines on how and when to use cyberattacks.

Ultimately, they hope to use the prototype and have other technology and organisational capabilities in place to be able to carry out smaller, more precise attacks orchestrated by individual commanders in the field.

The practical uses, though still far out, are incredible, says Daniel Kueh, an information warfare professor at National Defense University's iCollege. Specifically, he explains how eliminating power grids can be much more effective and less detrimental than during the conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, Serbia and Iraq.

'In all of those conflicts,' he said, 'we went after the other side’s electricity with bombs.'

But now, the military can be much more humane, taking out power only when necessary and then being able to quickly restore it, without having to build an entirely new grid.
