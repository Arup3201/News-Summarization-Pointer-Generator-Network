A prison guard in New York has been charged with having sex with an inmate, making it the second time in the past month that a female guard was arrested for having inappropriate relations with a prisoner.

Tyshinia Love Brewster was arrested on Wednesday for having sex with an unnamed inmate, and she is now allegedly six months pregnant with the inmate's child.

The 39-year-old guard was reportedly in a sexual relationship with an inmate at Downstate Correctional Facility in Fishkill, New York, where she had worked for the past seven and a half years.

Officials did not release any information about the inmate in question, but it does appear that their relationship was more than a one-time occurrence.

The couple would allegedly meet in his cell block during her shifts.

Brewster is now being charged with rape and official misconduct, while the prisoner has been transferred to another prison.

The latest case comes just two weeks after another female prison guard had sex with and became pregnant by an inmate.

Repercussions: Brewster is now allegedly six months pregnant with the inmate's child

In the case of Nancy Gonzalez, the 29-year-old prison guard at Metropolitan Detention Center who had sex with Ronell Wilson, a notorious cop killer.

Gonzalez said that she had the multi-month affair with the prisoner allegedly in an effort to keep him from being executed.

Wilson was a young gang member when he was convicted in the point-blank shootings of two undercover officers in an illegal gun sting gone awry.

Explanation: Gonzalez allegedly said in a recorded phone conversation that she was 'vulnerable' when she decided to start a relationship with Wilson in a bid to give him some 'hope'

‘I took a chance because I was so 
vulnerable and wanted to be loved and now I am carrying his child,’ 
Gonzalez said, according to court papers.

Wilson
was sentenced to death in the killing of officers Rodney Andrews and 
James Nemorin, but the sentence was thrown out in 2010 by an appeals 
court.

On Tuesday, Gonzales,
who is eight months pregnant, was taken into custody at her Long Island
home. She could face 15 years in prison if convicted.
