Sebastian Vettel hit another obstacle in his already troubled Formula One title defence when his Red Bull sputtered to a stop early in the opening practice session for Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix.

Lewis Hamilton steered his Mercedes to the fastest lap time of 1:27.023, while team-mate and championship leader Nico Rosberg was limited to only nine laps due to a cooling issue.

Vettel, running with a new chassis this weekend in a bid to find a cure for his poor form so far, was forced to pull off the track as his car ground to a halt with an electrical issue after completing only four laps.

After being wheeled back into a side exit, the RB10 was returned to the garage on the back of a flat-bed truck.

Although
 the team had 50 minutes to work on the problem, they were unable to get
 Vettel back out on the circuit, leaving him down in 20th place on the 
timesheet, with only the Caterhams of Kamui Kobayashi and Marcus 
Ericsson behind him.

Red Bull later revealed that the issue would force Vettel out of Friday's second session.

'Due to an electrical problem that has damaged the wiring loom of Car No 1, Sebastian will not be able to take part in FP2,' Red Bull said 'The team will use the time to fix it to be ready for FP3 tomorrow.'

As
 the man to beat following three successive victories for the first time
 in his Formula One career, Hamilton was comfortably quickest by almost 
nine tenths of a second over Button - the surprise name at the top of the
 timesheets.

The
 concern for Hamilton's rivals is there is far more to come from his 
Mercedes as he was fastest in all three sectors, albeit at different 
stages rather than on one single lap.

On
 the hard tyre, the slower of the two Pirelli compounds being used this 
weekend, the combined time of the three sectors was 1min 26.6secs, over 
four tenths of a second faster.

Button
 had warned on Thursday it was unlikely anyone would be in a position to
 challenge Mercedes, despite all teams bringing a major upgrade package 
to this event, and on first inspection his words appeared to carry 
plenty of truth.

At
 least the 34-year-old's McLaren was the best of the rest, with Button 
second, ahead of Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, the only other driver to 
finish within a second of Hamilton as the Australian was 0.950secs 
adrift.

With
 Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo in the paddock, Fernando Alonso 
hauled his car up to fourth, albeit 1.1secs behind Hamilton, with 
team-mate Kimi Raikkonen sixth.

Concern: Nico Rosberg completed only nine laps

Sandwiched
 between them was Rosberg, who had declared his hope on Thursday for a 
less problematic weekend than occurred at the last race in China where 
he encountered numerous issues.

Rosberg, however, only managed nine laps in his Mercedes due to a cooling concern with the ERS (energy recovery system).

McLaren's
 Kevin Magnussen and Pastor Maldonado in his Lotus were seventh and 
eighth quickest, followed by Sergio Perez in his Force India.

Perez,
 though, was forced to kick his heels in the garage for over half an 
hour as his team fixed an unusual problem - a loose wing mirror.

The
 Mexican had to drive one-handed at one point as he tried to stop the 
mirror from flapping around inside the cockpit of his car before 
returning to the pits for repairs.

Sauber
 reserve Giedo van der Garde suffered a more serious moment of 
consternation when his brakes failed at the end of the pit straight on 
the approach to turn one.

Fans behind the barriers ducked for cover as Van der Garde speared through the gravel, narrowly avoiding a crash.

In
 recovering the car and returning to the track, the Dutchman was then 
able to tour back to the garage where he remained for the final 28 
minutes.
