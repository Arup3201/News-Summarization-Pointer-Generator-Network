The actress said she stopped bleaching her teeth as it was too painful

Julie Walters has hit out against teeth whitening after being left in agony by the treatment when trying to remove green tea stains. 

The actress, who has previously condemned cosmetic surgery, said bleaching her teeth was so painful she halted the process after a few days.

Speaking ahead of the release of a programme on her life, the 64-year-old said she was forced to consider teeth whitening after drinking green tea for 20 years. 

'I drink green tea and quite honestly if you drink tea all your life, which I've drunk now for nearly 20 years, your teeth do begin to look a bit like wood,' Ms Walters said. 

'The dentist gave me something that you put on. It did get rid of the coffee stains, but then I thought, I can't do this anymore - it's too painful.' 

The actress, whose career is being honoured in a BBC programme tonight, added while she has never seen the appeal of image-conscious Hollywood where women are increasingly trying to look younger. 

'I'm not putting down anybody who has (cosmetic surgery), I just quite like to think I can grow old and it's fine.

'If people don't like me because I have wrinkles then I don't particularly want to be with them either,' the actress told the Times.

Earlier this year Ms Walters, who received a CBE from the Prince of Wales in 2008, told another magazine she would not live in America because of its attitude to appearance. 

Speaking with Good Housekeeping, she said:'It's the facelifts and the whole attitude to women. Everyone who lives there says you have to have a facelift. And everyone has had them… Everyone. 

'As people get older, they do this half-facelift stuff so they can pretend they haven't had them! I think: don't do it – be beautiful anyway.' 

Other British actresses to have spoken out against cosmetic surgery include Kate Winslet, Emma Thompson and Rachel Weisz.

Rosamund Pike said she would not have Botox

Emma Thompson

'I'm not fiddling about with myself. We're in this awful youth-driven thing now where everybody needs to look 30 at 60.' 

Rachael Weisz

'People who look too perfect don't look sexy or particularly beautiful.'

Kate Winslet

'It goes against my morals, the way my parents brought me up and what I consider to be natural beauty.

'I am an actress. I don't want to freeze the expressions on my face.' 

Rosamund Pike

'No way. Not even Botox. 

'You look at someone like Judi Dench and you just think she’s the most beautiful woman. 

'Because if you’re a beautiful person then somehow all the lines fall into the right place.'
