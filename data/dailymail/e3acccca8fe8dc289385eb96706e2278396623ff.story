A couple have been charged with child neglect after allegedly using meth in front of their children and allowed swinging partners to come to the house while the kids were home.

Andra Rae Martinez, 43, and Juan Martinez, III, 44, were charged with endangering a child in Houston, Texas on Thursday. 

Police said the couple left meth and pot in front of their children, a ten-year-old boy and six-year-old girl, and also allowed strange men to come to the house to have sex with the wife.

According to ABC, the husband would put ads online for men to come to the home and have sex with his wife. 

He also allegedly offered his six-year-old daughter for sex acts to one man, a claim which police were investigating.  

Investigators began looking into the couple's drug-filled, swinging behavior last September after a tip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

A search of the home uncovered drugs which were easily in reach of the children and they were also exposed to porn DVDs with explicit covers. 

Both parents denied having sexual interest in children despite court documents alleging that the father had incest fantasies. 

The ten-year-old boy reportedly told police he was worried his father would get in trouble for 'smoking something illegal'.  

Juan Martinez's bail was set at $30,000 and Andra Martinez's at $2,000.  

Daily Mail Online was awaiting comment from the Webster Police Department on Friday.
