Fifty years ago, bride and groom Tommy and Evelyn Johnston raised a glass of their favourite tipple to celebrate their romantic union.

The waiter's recommendation started a love affair between the couple and the sweet sparkling wine, one which they have enjoyed throughout their happy marriage.

To help them celebrate their golden anniversary, the maker of Barossa Pearl has made them a special edition bottle - and are now considering bringing the 1960s favourite back to shelves around Australia.

In 1964, Scottish couple Tommy and Evelyn Johnston (pictured middle) got married and on that day a waiter suggested they try Barossa Pearl, a sweet sparkling wine, to drink for the evening which then became the drink of their wedding toast

The couple, who married in Australia but moved back to their native Scotland after a few years in the 1960s, were stunned when their son Steven managed to pull off the surprise. 

'Growing up, my folks would tell me stories of coming to Australia,' he said.

'My parents got married after six weeks, my dad came to Australia and invited my mother, so she bit the bullet and went to Australia and in two weeks they got married.

'They have managed to stay together for 50 years, it says a lot for their relationship.' 

As well as falling in love with each other, they fell in love with Barossa Pearl, which was made by winemakers Jacobs Creek until 1983.

'They loved it,' said Steven, who still lives in Perth. 'They told me they drank it for years to come all the time.  

The couple's son, Steven (pictured left) organised a bottle of Barossa Pearl on their golden wedding anniversary, made specially by Jacob's Creek for the couple despite the wine not being made anymore

'I wrote to the wine maker for Jacobs Creek, Bernard Hickin, because I saw a story that they were thinking about re-introducing it.

'I sent an email telling him about my parents and their unique story, how they came to Australia to marry and how they loved to drink Barossa Pearl.'

Amazingly he got a letter back and Jacobs Creek agreed to prepare a one-of-a-kind, handmade bottle in time for him to fly to Scotland and surprise his parents.

'I got it in July, they sent it to Perth and then I flew it over to Scotland,' he said.

'It was nice because it (the bottle) came with a letter saying it was a one-off bottle and the original recipe, bottled with the same bottle as in the 70s.

'When I got to Scotland I gave it to my parents and read out the letter.

'Dad was so surprised I went to all the bother and they were delighted at the extra special gift. I didn't realise it would come to all this.'

And they didn't wait long to crack it open.

'Mum took a second glass, she doesn't drink a lot but she enjoyed it and the bottle was gone within half an hour.'

While the Johnstons had a very special one off bottle of the Barossa Pearl, Jacobs Creek has now decided to bring back the semi sparkling wine for Christmas, 58 years after it was first launched.

As Australia's first naturally sweetened sparkling wine, Barossa Pearl created a revolution in Australian wine making and became the ultimate in popular party drinks in the 1950s, 60s and right up until 1983.
