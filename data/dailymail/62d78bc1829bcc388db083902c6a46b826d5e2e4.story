Wayne Rooney will play against Bayern Munich on Wednesday even if it means having a pain-killing injection for a toe injury prior to the game, manager David Moyes said.

Manchester United are in desperate need of Rooney's power and finishing ability in Munich as they look to improve on a 1-1 home draw in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final last week and book a spot in the last four.

'He will definitely play,' Moyes said in his pre-match press conference. 'We will do all we can to get him on the pitch. He is happy to take an injection.

'He is able to train and is massively keen to be involved. He's not trained all week so we need to be wary of that.

'He
 is ready to take an injection which shows you his feeling for the game 
and the club. We think it’s ok because we wouldn’t do anything wrong, 
and we take advice from our doctors.

'Everybody
 knows the character Wayne is and the kind of player he is. He is 
determined to play and if he is determined we would be mad not to play 
him.

'It is the hardest game for us so far. Both teams have top players.'

Moyes said every player would need to
 be at their best and that his team needed to improve from their 
first-leg performance in order to edge past last season's treble winners
 into the semi-finals.

'We can and will play better than in the first leg and we have to play better in order to progress,' said Moyes.

'We will need a good performance from everyone. We cannot have any passengers.

'It [the tactical approach] doesn’t alter a lot because if Bayern score we have to score as well.

'We have to go out and win the game but we have to be better on the ball in the game than we were in the first.

'But we need the determination to get the result.'

United
 were all but written off before the first leg against the powerful 
Bavarians, but have given themselves a chance with the draw at Old 
Trafford.

But English teams have generally done well in Germany over the last couple seasons, and Moyes is aware of this.

'I think it would be something which is more in Bayern’s mind that the English teams have come here and got a good record. They will have that doubt in their mind.

'They are European champions but they will have the games they have played against English teams in mind. We will try to use it to your advantage.'

Treble: Guardiola is looking for a third Champions League triumph

Bayern 
slumped to their first league defeat in 53 games on Saturday and have 
gone three games without a win for the first time since 2011.

Another
 worry for Bayern is their failure to win any of their last four matches
 against English opposition at the Allianz Arena, a run that started 
with their penalty shootout defeat to Chelsea in the 2012 Champions 
League final.

They 
have since lost and drawn against Arsenal and lost to Manchester City.

United's own recent form, on the other hand, with four goals in each of 
their last two Premier League wins, is another encouraging sign for 
Moyes.
