A woman from Washington was caught during the rush hour using the HOV lane with a giant stuffed Costco bear sitting in the front seat as her 'passenger'.

Washington State Patrol trooper Mark Francis says the woman was pulled initially for speeding as she was clocked going 74 in a 60-mile per hour zone. 

When the trooper approached the vehicle, they saw something else in the car.

Bare-faced cheek! The Washington State Patrol says they pulled over a woman carrying a giant stuffed bear in lieu of a passenger on Monday

'As she rolls that window down, she sees it is a bear sitting in the front passenger seat,' says Francis.

The 19-year-old driver from Everett told authorities the bear wasn't in the front seat to appear as a passenger.

'According to her,' said Francis, 'there was not enough room in the back of her minivan to put the bear back there. That's what she was doing with the bear in the front passenger seat.'

Despite the 'bare-faced' cheek of it all, the woman was still in violation because she was using the HOV lane without there being anyone else int he vehicle. 

In addition to speeding and  driving in the HOV lane, the woman also had no insurance. 

'She had a grand total of an $818 citation for speeding, no insurance and the HOV violation,' said Francis.
