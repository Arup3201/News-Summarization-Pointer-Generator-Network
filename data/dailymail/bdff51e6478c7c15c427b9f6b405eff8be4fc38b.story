No player likes being sent off, but Norrkoping's striker Alhaji Kamara reacted more strongly than most.

The Sierra Leone striker sprinted across the pitch beating his chest and screaming with rage, before the referee had even brought out the red card.

The striker showed no sign of slowing down, continuing to run straight down the tunnel and into the dressing rooms.

Despair: The striker, who scored earlier in the game, realises that he is being dismissed

Emotion: Kamara doesn't wait to be shown the red card before sprinting from the pitch

The outpouring of emotion looked more like a man celebrating a goal than leaving the pitch having been dismissed.

Kamara, 20, had earlier scored the equaliser as Norrkoping came back from two goals to earn a draw against Orebro in the Swedish Allsvenskan league.

But in the first minute of stoppage time the striker went in late on an opponent and was shown a second yellow card.
