Barely three hours into our stay in Copenhagen, and we are obsessed. Not just with all that pickled herring and its alarming tendency to repeat on you. Or the wonderful restaurants and dark bread and handsome architecture and the very attractive men.

Or even the alarming number of gigantic, wiry red beards bobbing about the streets. Apparently big, red beards are all the rage at the moment, which is serendipitous for the British Museum’s new Viking exhibition which opened in London this month.

No, our obsession is a little shallower.

Drama: Picturesque Copenhagen felt like a huge movie set for Scandi-drama fan Jane Fryer

Because, if you’ve watched as many Danish box-sets as my husband and I — three series of The Killing, two of Borgen and two of The Bridge, for starters — Copenhagen is one enormous film set. Everywhere you look, it’s familiar. 

The Parliament buildings, where Borgen’s Prime Minister Birgitte Nyborg click-clacks about in very tight suits and shiny heels, negotiating like mad with the Centre Left, or the Moderates, or whoever it is this week.

There are the docks, bound to be overflowing with murder victims. And the bridge to Sweden which The Bridge detectives Saga and Martin whizz over every ten minutes in their quest for national security in both Denmark and Sweden.

Sadly, we never quite made it to the five-mile long Oresund Bridge — we were planning on taking the train to Malmo while we alternately sang the haunting theme music to The Bridge and said ‘tak’ (Danish for ‘thank you’) to each other, but for some reason we just couldn’t leave the opulent splendour of the brilliantly luxurious Hotel D’Angleterre. (I have never stayed in a hotel room with quite so many soft towels or Bang & Olufsen products).

Famous locals: The Danish city is the backdrop to popular TV dramas The Bridge, featuring detectives Martin Rohde and Saga Noren (l) and The Killing whose main character Sarah Lund (r) has become a global style icon

Tense: Popular show Borgen follows the political dramas of (l-r) Katrine Fonsmark, Birgitte Nyborg Christensen and Jeremy Welsh

Over the past few years, Copenhagen, Denmark and indeed, pretty much everything Scandinavian (apart from perhaps their 22 million intensively farmed pigs), has become super cool. 

They boast Noma and Geranium — two of the best (and most expensive) restaurants in the world, amazing social welfare (thanks to astronomical taxes), endless happiness (Danes routinely come out top on global happiness surveys — although worryingly, they’re also in second place for the number of anti-depressants consumed per capita), fabulously stylish design, Lego and, more recently, the slew of TV drama series that have taken us all by storm.

Even their royal family is cool. Queen 
Margrethe II (who’s been on the throne since 1972) studied at Cambridge,
the Sorbonne and the London School of Economics, speaks Danish, 
English, French, Swedish and German, is an accomplished painter and 
fashion designer and, aged 73, is a committed chain smoker — though not 
in public any more.

Award-winning: Copenhagen restaurant Noma is often hailed as one of the world's best

The shops (particularly Illum — a bit
like Liberty, but calmer, sleeker and more stylish) are quirky and 
eclectic, and full of things you desperately want to buy, shouldn’t 
because the exchange rate isn’t great and then do anyway. 

Such
as my husband’s new (very slim-fitted) shirt covered in daisies. And 
the enormous industrial-style pendant lights we ordered as soon as we 
got home.

And the three vast loaves of the world’s best (and probably most expensive) sourdough bread from the Meyers Bageri on Kongensgade (owned by Claus Meyer of Noma) which we rammed into our hand luggage and have been eating ever since.

The Danes are big on cosiness — or Hygge, as they call it. They’re the masters of attractive ambience — candles, wonderful lighting, pleasing lines and smooth wood, even in McDonald’s. Given time was short over a weekend, we spent it mostly being ‘cosy’. 

From the launchpad of our incredibly central hotel, we concentrated our efforts in an array of cafes, wine bars (particularly the brilliant Ved Stranden 10, near Christiansborg Palace), restaurants and, thanks to visiting in the middle of the ‘Wondercool Copenhagen jazz and art festival’, experienced Danish ‘supergroup’, the Mountains (surprisingly good) and the truly wonderful Danish pianist Carsten Dahl.

Even my husband — who with a name like Miles Davis knows his jazz — was impressed. So impressed (and refreshed, courtesy of the Ved Stranden wine bar) that he didn’t notice when the lovely waitress at the Jazzhus Montmartre accidentally charged us for someone else’s dinner.‘It seems a bit expensive. Everyone knows Copenhagen’s not cheap, but £76 for two glasses of red wine.’

And it is expensive. Of course it is. It’s Denmark. But it’s worth it.

And the best thing about it is that, while it’s all lovely and stylish, it’s not that super-sleek Italian stylishness where you end up feeling dowdy and lumpy by comparison.

It’s far more accessible. The architecture is masculine and pleasing, without being twee. The people are attractive (particularly, it turns out, the red-bearded Viking crew), but not ridiculously so. And joy of joys, they drink enthusiastically, smoke like chimneys (perhaps the reason they have the highest cancer rates on the planet) dance badly and are highly cultured. 

This is, after all, a people who, back in the dark ages ironed their clothes, combed their hair and scooped wax from their ears with specially designed spoons.

Scene of the crime: The imposing Oresund Bridge between Denmark and Sweden

Unlike Italians, you can actually imagine living among them, fancying them, them fancying you. It helps, of course, that they all speak English better than we do and are incredibly friendly. 

Our last (herring-free) morning was spent mostly making a list of all the things we’d do the next time we come — hug the Little Mermaid, potter around the Tivoli Gardens (closed in winter), visit the extraordinarily beautiful old Stock Exchange building, have dinner in the brilliantly bouncy Cafe Victor on Ny Ostergade — and gushing to our taxi driver Hans about how brilliant all the Danish murder TV series are.

‘It’s always good to be good at something,’ he says. ‘And murder’s as good as anything, isn’t it? But here we mostly watch Midsomer Murders and Cash In The Attic — that’s a very good programme. You should watch it some time.’
