Patrice Evra 
has admitted he is keen on playing alongside his former Manchester United 
team-mate Carlos Tevez once again.

Tevez was Evra's team-mate at Manchester United before he left his friend behind when crossing the 
Manchester divide to join City in 2009.

The striker joined Juve from Manchester City last summer and scored 19 goals during his first season with the Bianconeri.

'Carlos is
 a warrior,' said Evra. 'It was tough for me to see him leave United 
for another team. We're great friends on and off the pitch.   

'It wasn't easy to leave Manchester United, it was a decision I made for personal reasons.

'I'm happy with the choice I've made in coming here. Juventus is a great club with a wonderful history.

'The minute they came calling, I knew it was the right choice for me.'

Evra hopes to help Juventus win a fourth consecutive league title - a feat Manchester United never quite achieved during his time at Old Trafford.

The 33-year-old left-back did lift the Barclays Premier League five times during his eight years in Manchester but the Red Devils' run towards claiming four in a row was interrupted by Chelsea in 2010.

Evra may not have been part of the Juve 
side that clinched three Serie A titles between 2012 and 2014, yet after
 making the 'tough' decision to swap England for Italy, he intends to 
play a key role in another successful defence.

The Frenchman said: 'It won't be easy to win four titles in a row. I managed to do it three times with Manchester United and know how difficult the challenge is.

'We also hope to do well in the Champions League. It's a great competition and we'll look to go as far as we can.'

Evra, who will wear the No 33 shirt in Turin, has signed a two-year contract at the Juventus Stadium.
