Out: Energy Secretary Steven Chu, pictured, is the latest of President Barack Obama's cabinet to announce his departure

Energy Secretary Steven Chu is the latest of President Barack Obama's cabinet to announce his departure.

The 64-year-old Nobel laureate in physics came under fire for his handling of a $528 million federal loan to solar panel manufacturer Solyndra during his tenure, after the company collapsed in 2011 and 1,100 workers lost their jobs.

But he will also be remembered for accomplishments including helping to plug a massive BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

Chu offered his resignation to President Obama in a letter on Friday. He said he will stay on at least until the end of February and may stay until a successor is confirmed.

Chu's decision to step down had been widely expected and follows announcements by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa Jackson and Jane Lubchenco, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, that they are leaving.

The White House said no decisions have been made on replacements for any of the environment and energy jobs but said Obama's priorities will remain unchanged.

Potential replacements for Chu include former North Dakota Sen. Byron Dorgan, former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm and former Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire.

Obama said in a statement on Friday that Chu brought a 'unique understanding of both the urgent challenge presented by climate change and the tremendous opportunity that clean energy represents for our economy.'

During his tenure, Chu helped move the country toward energy independence, Obama said, citing Energy Department programs to boost renewable energy such as wind and solar power.

'Thanks to Steve, we also expanded support for our brightest engineers and entrepreneurs as they pursue groundbreaking innovations that could transform our energy future,' Obama said. Chu, a former director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, had little political experience before taking the energy post in 2009.

He drew fire from congressional Republicans who criticized his handling of a $528 million federal loan to solar panel maker Solyndra, which later went bankrupt, laying off its 1,100 workers. Republicans said Chu and other Energy Department officials missed many warning signs about problems at Solyndra and compounded them by approving a restructuring of the loan even after problems were discovered.

Solyndra was the first renewable-energy company to receive a loan guarantee under the 2009 stimulus law, and the Obama administration frequently promoted the company as a model for its clean energy program.

Chu attended a 2009 groundbreaking when the loan was announced, and Obama visited the company's Fremont, Calif., headquarters the next year.

The company's implosion in 2011 and revelations that the administration hurried a review of the loan in time for the groundbreaking became an embarrassment for Chu and Obama and a rallying cry for GOP critics of the administration's green energy program.

Lawmakers also criticized Chu for approving the plan to restructure Solyndra's debt so that two private investors moved ahead of taxpayers for repayment in case of default.

Chu defended the Solyndra loan during a sometimes testy hearing in late 2011. While calling the ultimate outcome 'regrettable,' Chu said the loan was subject to 'proper, rigorous scrutiny and healthy debate' before it was approved in 2009.

'While we are disappointed in the outcome of this particular loan, we support Congress' mandate to finance the deployment of innovative technologies and believe that our portfolio of loans does so responsibly,' Chu said.

The White House said Chu retained Obama's confidence, but Chu was widely expected to leave following Obama's re-election last fall.

In a letter to Energy Department employees, Chu said he was proud of his tenure and cited dozens of accomplishments, including doubling the production of renewable energy from wind and solar power. Installations of small solar electric, or photovoltaic, systems have nearly doubled in each of the last three years, he said, while 42 per cent of new energy capacity in the U.S. last year was from wind â€”more than any other energy source, Chu said.

'I came with dreams and am leaving with a set of accomplishments that we should all be proud of,' he said.

One of his accomplishments was something that Chu rarely talked about: Obama repeatedly credits Chu with helping to plug the massive BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Chu and a team of engineers helped devised an interim solution before a replacement well permanently plugged the leak, which spewed more than 200 million gallons of oil in the worst offshore oil disaster in the country's history.

When Chu resigned, he singled out for praise Christine Gregoire, hinting she may be a possibility for the Obama administration's energy and climate team.

Chu lauded Gregoire, a Democrat who served as governor of Washington state from 2005 until mid-January and is long-time backer of President Barack Obama.

'I am especially appreciative of 
Governor Gregoire for her trust and support over the past six months,' 
Chu said in a lengthy resignation letter on Friday.

Chu worked with Gregoire on the clean-up of the Hanford site in Washington, one of the U.S. nuclear weapons development facilities.

Working on the nuclear waste issue with Gregoire and others has taken about five to 10 hours per week of his time over the last six months, Chu said in the letter.

Gregoire, 65, has worked on nuclear waste issues for decades. As a deputy state attorney general in the mid 1980s, Gregoire lobbied the federal government to disclose any health risks from contamination at Hanford.

Sources close to Gregoire say she has been vetted by the White House as a possible choice for a number of posts, including energy secretary, interior secretary and Environmental Protection Agency administrator.

Gregoire was an early supporter of Obama in his first White House race, and in doing so broke with Washington's U.S. senators, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, who supported Hillary Clinton.

In his letter, Chu said the Energy Department made 'historic progress' in cleaning nuclear contamination left from Cold War weapons development.

'Despite this progress, the environmental clean-up projects still have considerable technical and project management challenges,' he added.

Millions of gallons of toxic radioactive waste are stored in underground tanks at Hanford, a possible threat to the nearby Columbia River, which runs between Oregon and Washington State.

Security at the government's nuclear facilities would also fall to Gregoire if she became energy secretary.

During Chu's tenure, the Energy Department suffered an embarrassment when an 82-year-old nun and two peace activists broke into the government's maximum security facility for weapons grade uranium in Oakridge, Tennessee.
