A Canadian journalist working undercover in a Bangladeshi sweatshop has revealed details of the back-breaking work and appalling conditions children as young as nine have to deal with.

Raveena Aulakh traveled to Dhaka to experience firsthand conditions in garment factories that mass produce products for the West.

Her account in the Toronto Star sheds light on the long hours, poor pay and dangerous and unsanitary conditions factory workers are subjected to.

Heart breaking: Nine-year-old factory worker Meem was in charge of training undercover reporter Raveena Aulakh

Most shocking of all was how a nine-year-old girl named Meem, forced into work to help raise money for her family, was put in charge of training Ms Aulakh.

'The first time I saw Meem, which was 
also my first day at work at a sweatshop, she was having a good day 
despite the wretched heat. She sat cross-legged on the concrete floor, a
 tiny, frail figure among piles of collars, cuffs and other parts of 
unstitched shirts,' Ms Aulakh wrote in the Toronto Star.

The reporter's investigation came in the wake of the Rana Plaza factory collapse in April, when more than 1,100 workers died.

After what became known as the worst garment factory disaster in the world, there was intense scrutiny of working conditions and child labor.

But the larger factories also brought in improved security and screening programs, making it harder for undercover investigators to gain access.

Ms Aulakh was able to find work only after a Bangladeshi driver told a small factory owner, named Hamid, that she was related to his wife and had moved to the city for work.

After being offered a trial, Ms Aulakh found herself arriving at the sweatshop on an oppressively hot day in August.

'The factory wasn’t big: about two dozen 
sewing machines lined the walls of the windowless room, about half the 
size of a basketball court. Two cutting machines sat in a corner. The 
sewing machines had little benches for the operators, and almost all had
 piles of colorful fabric by the side. Three ceiling fans, covered with
 layers of dirt, hummed quietly,' she wrote.

A quick tour of the building revealed no fire extinguishers, only one exit - the front door - and little more than a hole in the ground, down a rat-infested hall, for the toilet.

Staff worked from 9am to 9pm with only a lunch break. The girls tasked with snipping off threads from the men's shirts being made, had to sit cross legged in the middle of the floor.

Ms Aulakh joined the girls on the floor and, under Meem's direction, was taught how to snip away loose threads without marking the clothes.

'It was back-breaking, it was 
finger-numbing. It was particularly rage-inducing,' she said.

'Not because it was 
painfully hard work but because children like Meem hunched over hour 
after hour, squinted at the threads, cleaned one collar after another, 
one cuff after another, one arm piece after another until the piles were
 depleted.'

Like many young factory workers, Meem was taken out of school when the family ran into hardship. With her mother pregnant and unable to work, the family needed Meem to help boost the income.

Her father found her the job at Hamid's factory because the girl's aunt also worked there and would be able to look after her.

Overnight, Meem went from being a carefree schoolgirl to a factory worker, toiling for 12 hours a day.

'It works for everyone,' Smitha Zaheed, of the Dhaka-based Independent Garment Workers’ Union Federation, said. 'Factory
 owners get workers who are not demanding ... while the parents get to
 keep what the kids earn because the kids don’t know any better.'

Meem's wages are paid to her father and she is allowed to buy herself a glittery hair clip each month and an occasional ice-cream.

'It is not as if Meem’s parents don’t 
care for her, they simply had no choice,' Ms Aulakh wrote.

Despite the long hours and aches caused from sitting hunched over for hours at a time, Meem was always smiling and her only complaint was that she was yelled at if she chatted too much or hummed too loudly.

Workers like Meem are paid about $25 a month. They are allowed half a day off every Friday and do not get holidays or paid sick leave.

In a country with widespread poverty however, such jobs are valued and Meem had ambitions to move up the factory chain to become a better-paid sewing operator.

'When I become a sewing operator, I will make very good shirts,' she said. 'No one will yell at me.'

The lifestyle is so common in Bangladesh that Meem and another of the girls, 13-year-old Taaniya think nothing of ending their education early.

Even at their young ages they knew how the extra money could help and talked of how their families had been able to buy furniture and goats.

Taaniya also hoped she could earn enough to avoid being married off to a stranger.

'By all accounts, working women are changing their lives, 
their families’ lives,' Ms Aulakh said. 'There is more food in homes, and cleaner clothes.
 There is electricity, even if it’s one bulb, and there are toilets ... But it has come at a price.'

For children like Meem, the factory has become their life. Ms Aulakh may have been able to return to her comfortable home and office job, but the knowledge that thousands of girls remain trapped in such back-breaking work has stayed with her.
