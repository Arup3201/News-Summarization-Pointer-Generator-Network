Rowers at Cambridge University have been accused of killing three-week-old ducklings with their oars during their ‘May Bumps’ college races.

The annual traditional event on the River Cam sees undergraduate crews from rival colleges trying to catch the boat ahead by bumping it.

But local residents have complained that the boats have been ploughing through groups of young ducks.

Sad: Student rowers at Cambridge University have been accused of killing ducklings

Lee Culley, 44, who lives in a boat on the river claims he witnessed at least two ducklings being killed during one race.

He also said he has spotted other dead birds and a mother looking for her missing young.‘It was absolutely disgusting,’ he said. ‘They just sped through even though I shouted to them, warning them about the ducks.

‘They just kept on going and their blades went through the ducks and killed two. The ducks were only three weeks old.

‘Another one died the next day and the mother has none but keeps coming back to my boat looking for the brood.

‘I am worried about the other wildlife. We just don’t have that much of it left on the river because there are just too many rowers.’

The May Bumps were this year held over three days from Wednesday to yesterday (FRI).

Careful: Cambridge University have said every effort is made so as to not harm wildlife

Cambridge University Combined Boat Clubs, which runs the event, said: ‘Every effort is being made to mitigate disturbance to wildlife and to keep ducks and other waterfowl out of the way of racing boats.

‘Indeed, the start of the men’s second division on Wednesday night was delayed by 15 minutes while a family of ducks were guided out of harm’s way.

‘We are very sorry to hear of the incident Mr Culley apparently witnessed and will be briefing stewards to be extra vigilant.

‘The rowing community, the Cam Conservators residential boaters and Cambridge Animal Rights have met and formed the Cam River Users Group (CRUG) to discuss the issues surrounding river use and wildlife.’

‘Bumping’ started in the 1820s as a way that crews from a number of colleges could race at the same time on the narrow river.

Rather than race side-by-side, the crews are spread down a stretch of the river with one and a half boat lengths (about 90 feet) of clear water between them.

The object of ‘bumping’ is to catch up and bump into the crew in front, without being caught from behind.
