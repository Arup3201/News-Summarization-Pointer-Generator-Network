Dixie Dean, the Everton striker who scored 60 goals in the 1927-28 First Division season, was once asked whether his record would ever be broken.

'I think it will,' the Englishman reportedly said. 'But there's only one man who'll do it. That's the fellow that walks on the water. I think he's about the only one.'

Eighty-six years on, though, and Chelsea striker Diego Costa is on course to surpassing that tally, having already scored seven goals in his first four games. At that scoring rate, the 25-year-old is scheduled to end the season on 66 goals.

60 - Dixie Dean (Everton, 1927-28)

59 - George Camsell (Middlesbrough, 1926-27)

55 - Ted Hartson (Mansfield, 1936-37)

     - Joe Payne (Luton, 1936-37)

52 - Terry Bly (Peterborough, 1960-61)

It is all hypothetical, of course. But it still gives hope to those at Stamford Bridge after years of cursed strikers. Fernando Torres, Andriy Shevchenko and many more have failed. Yet with Costa there's never a dull moment.

The Spain striker's extraordinary start to life in the Premier League has catapulted him to become odds-on favourite to win the Golden Boot with many bookmakers, according to Oddschecker.com.

Costa's nearest challenger is Daniel Sturridge at 10/1. Manchester United's own acquisition, Radamel Falcao, has been made third favourite at 14/1, despite a seven-goal deficit to overturn already.

Also within Costa's sights is the single-season Premier League goal record.

Alan Shearer and Andy Cole hold the record for a 42-game season with 34 goals for Blackburn and Newcastle respectively, meaning Costa is 27 shy of that total at present.

Shearer also holds the joint record for a 38-game Premier League season (the top flight was reduced from 22 to 20 teams for the 1995-6 term). 

The former England captain notched 31 goals for Blackburn in 1995-6, a total matched by Cristiano Ronaldo at Manchester United in 2007-8 and Luis Suarez for Liverpool last season. 

Costa is now 24 goals short of that illustrious trio.

31 - Alan Shearer (Blackburn, 1995–96)

     - Cristiano Ronaldo (Man United, 2007–08)

     - Luis Suarez (Liverpool, 2013–14)

There has been no adjustment period needed for Costa and little sign of a supposedly suspect hamstring. Little looks like stopping the predator who scored 36 goals last season as Atletico Madrid won the La Liga title and reached the Champions League final.

Costa, rewarded for his super start with the Player of the Month accolade, proved last term was no fluke after netting against Burnley and Leicester City in his opening two games in England. 

He scored twice - and proved a real menace - in the 6-3 win over Everton at Goodison Park, before clinically putting three past Swansea City at Stamford Bridge to maintain Chelsea's 100 per cent record so far.

Jose Mourinho refused to bite after that game, though. The Special One would not confirm Costa as the answer to prayers that so often emerged from Stamford Bridge last season, nor will he expect too much.

Nevertheless, Mourinho humoured us. 'If the team plays well, he has to score goals,' said the Blues boss.

'Seven in four is maybe too much. It is something that is not normal. We cannot expect that after eight matches he will have 14 goals.' 

But Mourinho added: ‘He is comfortable in the team. The team was built in a way that we were waiting for a certain type of striker and I think now everybody knows that Chelsea did the right thing in waiting for him and not going into the market in the summer of 2013 or January.

‘We waited for the right one.’

Costa has already staked his claim on a number of top-flight records but the striker remains in contention to break the biggest one of them all, which Dean has kept safe for 86 years and counting.
