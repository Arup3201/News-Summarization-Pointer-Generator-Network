Advances: The new system will make it easier to move money around

Technology to allow direct payments between mobile phones was unveiled by the big banks yesterday. The system cuts out the need to remember sort codes and bank account details.

Instead, you type on your phone the mobile number of the person or business you want to pay.

The ‘Paym’ transfers, which will be password-protected, need your bank account to be linked to your own mobile number.

Users will simply tap in the number of the recipient on their phone to authorise an electronic transfer from one account to another.

The industry hopes the system will replace cheques, which are expensive to transport and process.

At the same time it could provide a substitute for cash to make relatively small payments to tradesmen, window cleaners or gardeners.

The idea is that millions of people will have their mobile phone number tied to their bank account – as a substitute for the normal account number and sort code.

There is a security safeguard in that the name of the recipient will appear on the smartphone screen, once the number has been tapped in, so confirming the cash is going to the right person.

Access to the Paym system will be covered by password or code protection in an attempt to avoid the risk of the phone being stolen and used to raid customers’ accounts.

Paym has been devised by the finance industry’s Payments Council, which is the trade body responsible for running the electronic payments system on behalf of banks and building societies.

The council’s chief executive, Adrian Kamellard, said: ‘We’re all used to the idea of a ‘mobile update’ to improve our apps - Paym is a mobile update for payments that means you can pay securely using just a mobile number.

‘Paym will make it easier to repay a friend for cinema tickets, split a restaurant bill or settle up for a colleague’s birthday collection.’

Changes: The system 'has the potential to link up every bank account in the country with a mobile number'

He added: ‘Paym is a great example of industry-wide collaboration that delivers tangible benefits for customers.

‘The service has the potential to link up every bank account in the country with a mobile number.

‘Millions of people will be able to use it this year and we look forward to expanding Paym even further, so everyone can benefit from this easy, secure new way to pay.’

Paym will be integrated into customers’ existing mobile banking or payment apps as an additional way to pay, making it possible to send and receive payments using a mobile number. 

When it is launched in the spring, customers of nine bank and building society brands – Lloyds, HSBC, Barclays, Halifax, Santader, TSB, Bank of Scotland, Cumberland Building Society, and Danske Bank - will be able to use the new service.

The nine launch brands will offer their customers the opportunity to register their mobile number and select the current account they want payments made into before the service goes live.

This will immediately make the new system the most wide-ranging payment service capable of moving funds directly from account to account, without the need for sort codes or account numbers.

Paym will expand later this year to include First Direct, NatWest, RBS, Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and Isle of Man Bank. The Nationwide building society is committed to joined in early 2015, while the Metro Bank and Ulster Bank are also finalising their participation.
