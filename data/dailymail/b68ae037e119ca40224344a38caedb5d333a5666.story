Sand enthusiasts have boldly gone where no one has gone before as the world's first ever science fiction themed sand sculpture festival opened yesterday.

The sculptures, which are up to four metres high feature scenes from popular sci-fi films and television shows, including Star Trek, King Kong, Star Wars, the Time-Machine, Alien and even popular TV puppet series Thunderbirds.

A five-foot carving of Spock's famous hand sign is part of the Star Trek work, with many characters featured all carved precisely from mounds of sand.

Sculptures featured characters from the original Star Wars trilogy, including Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia

The launch today at Sandworld, in Dorset, featured the designer of Darth Vader's costume mask and of the Storm Troopers, Brian Muir from Iver in Buckinghamshire.

The designer lives very close to Pinewood studios and is very much in demand from filmmakers of all kinds.

But he was invited down to the coast to help launch this special science fiction festival that will run for the remainder of the year.

Owner of Sandworld Mark Anderson said 'We were thrilled when Brian said he would come to the opening and we did have Darth Vader and some troopers here as a surprise and Darth Vader even showed him the force as they both acted out a scene from the film at the opening'.

The Star Wars characters came from a group of enthusiasts based in the county and are called the Dorset troopers; the queuing public were thrilled when the characters joined them at the ceremony.

The festival took inspiration from many science fiction films and television shows, including Alien
