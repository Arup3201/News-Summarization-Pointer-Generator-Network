The mother of Mikaeel Kular was charged with his murder yesterday.

Rosdeep Kular, 33, appeared at court in Edinburgh four days after calling police to report her son missing.

She was also accused of ‘attempting to defeat the ends of justice’ in connection with the death of three-year-old Mikaeel, whose body was found in woodland just yards behind his aunt Pandeep Kular’s bungalow in Kirkcaldy, Fife.

Miss Kular, who has four other children, entered no plea to the charges 
and has been remanded in custody until a further hearing next Tuesday, 
January 28.

Mikaeel was reported missing by his mother at 7.15am last
 Thursday.

She told police she had put him to bed at 9pm the night 
before and discovered he had gone when she went to wake him up in the 
morning.

During
 a brief court appearance at Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday, Miss 
Kular entered no plea or declaration to the charges and was remanded in 
custody and committed for further examination.

The two-minute hearing
 before Sheriff Frank Crowe was closed to the press and public, as is 
common for first appearances in Scotland.

Miss Kular’s court 
appearance next week will also be private, before details of the charges
 will be revealed at a later date in open court.

Yesterday, pictures 
emerged of Miss Kular posing with the son she is accused of killing. She
 had posted them on online dating website Badoo, which she last accessed
 just over a  week ago.

Writing about her children, she told 
potential suitors: ‘I’m a single mother of five beautiful monsters, so 
if you’re not keen on kids I suggest you “move on”

Moved: A group of children were seen arriving at the bungalow armed with their soft toys and teddies to leave in honour of Mikaeel

Duty: An policeman arranges flowers and teddy bears left by shocked members of the public while a woman police officer stands guard outside the home

Hundreds of mourners gathered in Edinburgh last night to pay tribute to the three-year-old after his body was recovered by police

Gathering: Muirhouse St Andrew's Church was filled with members of the community last night who gathered to pay their respects after the search for Mikaeel Kular was called off by police

Guard: Two police officers stand outside the church doors as hundreds of locals arrive to pay tribute to the boy

RIP: A boy holds up a placard saying 'Mikaeel Kular, you'll be missed in the community's heart, sleeptight'

Vigil: Four-year-old Katie McGarry, holds a candle near the property the three-year-old boy shared with his four siblings and his mother

‘I’m working hard to get what  I want in this life and make something positive from it, for me and my kids’ future.’

She
 added that while her main interests were ‘being a mum’ and ‘family’, 
she also likes vodka, tequila, red wine, champagne, nightlife and 
‘staying up late’.

‘I’m on here for a laugh more than anything,’ she wrote.

‘If I meet someone then all good and well but I won’t be losing any sleep over it.

‘I
 generally speak my mind, I’m down to earth and up for a laugh (can be 
quite sarcastic) and pretty happy to do most things as long as it’s with
 good company.’

Neighbours and those who knew the boy took time today to pay tribute - with many leaving bunches of flowers and candles

On her profile she said she lived in Edinburgh and 
was looking for men aged 25 to 40. She described herself as 5ft 6ins, 
139lbs with an ‘average’ body and able to speak English, Punjabi, Hindu 
and some Urdu.

Discussing her attraction to masculine men, she added:
 ‘I do have to say I like none of this new age, airy fairy men and 
wearing more make-up than me c**p.’

Miss Kular’s estranged husband 
Omotoso Adekoya, a Nigerian taxi driver, is the father of her three 
oldest children, while the father of Mikaeel and his twin sister Ashika 
is a Pakistani man who has had no contact with them.

Miss Kular’s 
mother Harjinder, 59, a retired doctor, said: ‘This has been such a 
difficult time and  my head is all over the place. I’m very sad.’

Fife
 Council had been involved with the family for years – but when Miss 
Kular moved to Edinburgh, colleagues in the city were not informed, 
sources said.

The council is now expected to face an inquiry into how it handled the case.
