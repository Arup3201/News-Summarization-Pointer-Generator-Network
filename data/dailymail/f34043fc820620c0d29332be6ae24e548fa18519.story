The defense attorney for Aaron 
Schaffhausen has claimed his client was suffering from a mental illness 
caused by a deep dependency on his ex-wife when he murdered his three 
young daughters last summer.

Schaffhausen has admitted to killing 
his three daughters - 11-year-old Amara, eight-year-old Sophie and 
Cecilia, five, - on July 10 last year, but claims he was not responsible 
due to mental illness.

Defense attorney John Kucinski said his client became mentally unstable 
following his divorce due to depression which was compounded by 
the personality disorder involving his dependence on his ex-wife.

Lawyers for Aaron Schaffhausen claim he was suffering from a mental illness caused by a deep dependency on his ex-wife when he murdered his three young daughters last summer

Kucinski argued that his client committed the crimes to help break his 
dependency on Jessica Schaffhausen, adding that the prosecution's 
argument that Schaffhausen committed the killings to hurt his ex-wife 
did not make sense.

The killings, Kucinski told jurors, were in some ways not about people; 
they were about the dependency, which stemmed from his childhood 
relationships with his parents and later transferred to Jessica 
Schaffhausen.

‘This crime is deeply rooted in Aaron's dependency,’ said Kucinski. ‘That's where all this comes from.’ 
Both sides made closing arguments Tuesday, April 16, in Schaffhausen's insanity trial, reports TwinCities.com.

But prosecutor Gary Freyberg countered in his closing statement by 
saying there was nothing puzzling or mysterious about the crimes; 
Schaffhausen killed his three girls because he was jealous and angry.

‘Please do not be fooled into thinking that just because a father murders his children that he must be insane,’ Freyberg said.

"Angry that his wife left him and wouldn't take him back," Freyberg said.

Schaffhausen was in control of his actions and made a clear choice, the prosecutor said.

"He chose the satisfaction of revenge over the satisfaction of being a father," Freyberg said.

Aaron Schaffhausen's fate is now in the hands of a St. Croix County jury.

Should the jury find Schaffhausen not responsible for the killings, he 
would be committed to a mental health institution, possibly for life. If
found responsible, he will be sentenced to life in prison.

Last week Aaron Schaffhausen's aunt had told the court that the killer was 'unplanned by his mom and unwanted by his dad'.

Patricia Fix appeared at the trial along with Schaffhausen's mother, father and prison psychiatrist. Ms Fix also said that the family had a history of depression. 

His father also testified that Aaron was a difficult baby who did not like to be touched.

Roger Schaffhausen testified that his son Aaron was a rebellious and belligerent teen who had some 'run-ins with the law'. The elder Schaffhausen says his son stole a gun, brought it to high school and was expelled.

However he admitted that his son became a better person after marrying his wife Jessica and that he liked being a father to his three daughters.

Roger Schaffhausen said that when his son's marriage broke down and his estranged wife began seeing someone else then he began to behave strangely and made deeply alarming remarks.

According to Fox, Mr Schaffhausen senior said: 'There was one phone call received around 
two o'clock in the morning. He was very despondent, depressed.

'Sounded 
like he was always weeping. That he wanted to do terrible things to 
Jess' boyfriend. He wanted to hurt the girls to show how much pain he 
was in.'

The murder suspect's mother Sue Allen told jurors that her son became extremely depressed when he and his wife Jessica broke up. She said that mental illness was common in other relatives.

Ms Fix said that she had been deeply concerned that Schaffhausen was going to harm his daughters when he made phone calls to her.

Dr Ralph Baker, a prison psychiatrist, also took the stand. He explained that while Shaffhausen was depressed, he did not appear to have a mental condition that would legally support an insanity defense. 

Baker says Schaffhausen told him what happened at the house was a 'spur of the moment thing'.

Schaffhausen told Baker he tried to help Cecilia find her shoes, and the next thing he knew, he had his hands on her neck and was strangling her before then slitting his three daughters' throats.
