Raheem Sterling is confident that he will sign a new long-term contract with Liverpool before the end of the season.

The talented forward, who scored in the 2-0 victory against Southampton on Sunday, earns around £35,000 a week on a deal which expires in the summer of 2017.

Brendan Rodgers is keen to tie down the former QPR youngster at Anfield, having admitted last month that Sterling had been offered a 'wonderful deal' believed to be in the region of £100,000 a week.

The England star, who is being monitored by Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain, is yet to commit his future to the Reds despite months of talks between the club and his representatives. 

However, after netting his side's second goal at St Mary's, Sterling confirmed that he hopes to put pen to paper in the near future.

Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Sterling said: 'We're working on it and hopefully it will be sorted soon.'

Liverpool's win moved them to within two points of fourth place, increasing their hopes of a return to the Champions League next season.

Sterling added: 'It's always good to get on the scoresheet and it was especially pleasing that it was the goal that killed the game off.

'We knew we were top four material from the start of the season. Obviously, it didn't go as planned at the start but now we're showing what we can do.

'Credit to the boys, we just keep to need keep performing and keep fighting and then we'll definitely get to where we want to be.'
