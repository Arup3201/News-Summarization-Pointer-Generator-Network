The general election is set to be a battle of the generations, with the Tories wooing pensioners while Labour tries to persuade the under-30s to turn out to vote. 

David Cameron is poised to announce he will protect pensioner benefits including winter fuel cash and TV licences from cuts as part of what has been dubbed a 'Fifty Shades of Grey' strategy.

By contrast, Ed Miliband's best hopes of becoming Prime Minister depend on Labour's appear to people in their twenties and thirties, who could swing the result in dozens of seats.

The Conservatives are most popular with the over-60s while Labour's appeal is highest among 25-39 year olds

All the main party leaders yesterday took part in a Q&A session with young people on Sky News and Facebook.

While Mr Cameron was challenged over cuts to housing benefit for the under-25s, Mr Miliband focussed on promising 'higher skill, higher wage jobs'. 

The Conservatives are most popular with the over-60s, with 37 per cent saying they will back Mr Cameron, compared to only 22 per cent of 18-24 year olds.

By contrast, Labour's appeal is highest among 25-39 year olds at 41 per cent, falling sharply to 27 per cent among the over-60s.

The Tories have made clear where their ambitions lie with a series of pro-pensioner policies.

They include increasing the state pension by at least 2.5 per cent each year, £10billion in Pensioner Bonds paying higher interest rates and allowing people to withdraw all of the pension funds when they retire.

Mr Cameron last week signalled that he will protect benefits for Britain’s wealthiest pensioners, insisting there were not big savings to be made from cutting winter fuel payments, TV licences and bus passes for the well-off.

It is seen as the clearest signal yet that the Tories who believe older people hold the key to election victory.

Health Minister Norman Lamb has warned Tory cuts could cost lives

Planned Tory spending cuts will have 'very serious consequences' for the old and frail – and could even cost lives, a Lib Dem minister has warned.

Health Minister Norman Lamb said Conservative plans to slash the deficit without increasing taxes meant it was 'inevitable' that care for the elderly would be drastically hit.

He said old-age care was already facing huge pressures, but Mr Cameron's decision to protect school funding as well as health and overseas aid meant the impact was now going to be 'massive'.

This will mean 'unacceptable standards of care' which could cost lives, he said.

Mr Lamb told MailOnline: 'Now they've said schools are going to be ring-fenced, the proportionate impact on other areas is going to be even greater.

'I'm quite sure they won't be ring-fencing councils [which control social care spending] against deficit reduction and so the impact on services for frail elderly people could be massive and the knock on effect for the NHS could be significant as well.'

He went on: 'If you are going to cut that further, and as far as I can see that's inevitable under the Tories' plans, the consequences for older people are very serious.'

Asked if it would put their lives at risk he said: 'Of course, potentially that is the case, but also just unacceptable standards of care.

'If they want to solve that by transferring money from the NHS budget, then it means they are not ring-fencing the NHS.' 

Labour has said it will stop winter fuel payments to 600,000 pensioners with incomes of more than £42,000.

One Tory Cabinet minister said: 'At the end of the day, pensioners are more likely to vote. Labour is sending the signal that they are ready to come after pensioners, which will anger even those with incomes nothing like £42,000.

'Cutting pensioner benefits won't raise a lot of money but will frighten an awful lot of people who we need to support us.' 

Answering questions about benefit cuts for the young yesterday, Mr Cameron insisted school leavers should not be able to move straight into a life on the dole.

The Tory leader said: 'Today as we speak, there is the option as you leave school to go and sign on, to get unemployment benefit and then to get a flat and housing benefit and I just think that is a bad way to start your life. 

'It is much better either to go on and do an apprenticeship or go to university or go to college or get a job, those are better options and I don't think that this idea that you can somehow opt out of working life and training, I think it’s a bad approach and we shouldn’t do it.' 

Meanwhile, Labour has clear its intention to target younger voters. Mr Miliband has launched plans for a young people’s manifesto. 

Taking part in the Stand Up And Be Counted Q&A event, he said: 'I think it is incredibly important that we have a manifesto that does reflect the wishes of young people. 

'We are going to give the vote to 16 and 17 year olds. I think we want to hear the voices of young people more in our politics but you come back to me and say what you think we should be doing that we’re not.'

Barely half of 18-24-year-olds voted in the 2010 election, compared to almost three-quarters of the over-65s.

In the last 50 years total turnout has fallen from 77 per cent in 1964 to 65 per cent four years ago.

In the sixties turnout was highest among 35-54 year olds, but social change and a sense of duty among the post-war generation means that 5 per cent more of of the over-65s voted in 2010 than the next highest age group.

Sadiq Khan, Labour's shadow justice secretary, has accused parties of deliberately targeting older because they were more likely to vote.

He warned the problem meant more people in their twenties and thirties were becoming disengaged from the political process, believing parties will only govern in the interests of the elderly. 

'You look at any empirical analysis of this government's policies and you can see they are going for the silver vote,' he said.

Turnout has fallen must steeply among 18-24-year-olds, according to research of elections dating back to 1964

A study by the Intergenerational Foundation suggests if 2 per cent more people aged 18-34 year olds turned out to vote, they could oust 20 sitting MPs. 

An increase of 5 per cent would remove 41 MPs and 10 per cent would unseat 83 MPs. 

Angus Hanton, IF Co-Founder, said it dispels the myth that ‘younger people’s votes hold no power’.

‘Ignoring the interests of younger generations in favour of maintaining support from the grey vote with measures such as the Pensioner Bond, may see politicians punished at the ballot box.

‘Our research suggests that at least 50 MPs should seriously consider their offer to young people.’
