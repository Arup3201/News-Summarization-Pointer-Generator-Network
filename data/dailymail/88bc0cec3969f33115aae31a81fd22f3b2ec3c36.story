He's photographed everyone from Jerry Hall and Kate Moss to Mick Jagger and Damon Albarn but David Bailey has no plans to start putting himself in his celebrity portraits.

Speaking at the launch of his new retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery, Bailey, 76, revealed that he 'couldn't see the point' of selfies and condemned the trend as 'just another craze'.

He also said he expected to see the end of the selfie in the not too distant future, adding: 'It's just a silly moment and people won't be doing it in six months. There will be another craze.'

Definitely not a selfie: A self-portrait taken during Bailey's period of National Service in Singapore, 1957

Stunning: Blur singer Damon Albarn, photographed in 2007, and a portrait of Kate Moss taken in 2013

Although Bailey, who says he is too busy taking photographs of other people to take selfies, might not approve, the craze has so far found favour with celebrities and political leaders alike.

Last year, David Cameron caused controversy when he was spotted posing for a selfie with Barack Obama and Danish premier Helle Thorning-Schmidt during Nelson Mandela's memorial service.

Other celebrity fans of the selfie include Justin Bieber, Harry Styles, Rihanna and Madonna, all of whom regularly post self-portraits on social media sites.

Although there are no selfies, the retrospective, Bailey's Stardust, does include plenty of A-list portraits, among them iconic shots of Kate Moss, Damian Albarn and Jerry Hall.

The 250 works on show at the National Portrait Gallery also include portraits of many of his former wives and lovers, among them French 
actress Catherine Deneuve and model Marie Helvin.

Bailey's most famous muse-turned-lover also appears: 60's supermodel Jean 
Shrimpton, whose affair with the photographer was immortalised in BBC4 film We'll Take Manhattan.

Other highlights include a 1989 photo of his current wife Catherine, a playful shot of Jerry Hall and the late Helmut Newton in Cannes in 1978, and a 1957 self-portrait taken during the 75-year-old photographer's time doing National Service in Singapore.

Bailey's Stardust also sheds light on a less well-known part of his oeuvre - a series of documentary photos taken in India and Papua New Guinea that, for all their beauty, have been largely overshadowed by his celebrity work.

Speaking about the exhibition, Sandy 
Nairne, director of the National Portrait Gallery, London, commented: 
‘Bailey’s Stardust is a very special event.

'It
 offers an exceptional opportunity to enjoy the widest range of the 
mercurial portraits created by David Bailey, one of the world’s greatest
 image-makers.’

Notorious: Bailey's 2002 portrait of millionaire businessman and author - and former criminal - Roy Shaw

Despite his impressive portfolio, the veteran photographer also revealed that he has no plans to rest on his laurels and retire.

Refusing to describe the exhibition as a retrospective, he told the Times that he has 'no time for nostalgia' and is looking ahead to his next project.

'I'm only interested in now, this moment,' he added. 'When this moment is gone, it's another moment. I thought I'd have a word with the Devil at the crossroads and see if I can get a bit more time.'
