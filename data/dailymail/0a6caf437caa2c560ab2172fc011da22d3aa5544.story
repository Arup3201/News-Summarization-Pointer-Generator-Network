Schoolgirl Megan Stammers used her 37-year-old mother's passport to flee to France  with her former maths teacher, it was claimed today.

The 15-year-old boarded a ferry from Dover to Calais last Thursday night with Jeremy Forrest, 30, and allegedly used her mother, Danielle Wilson's, identity.

Forrest, suspected of abducting Megan, was meanwhile being held in 
one of the toughest and most overcrowded prisons in France following his
arrest in the south west city of Bordeaux.

Married Jeremy Forrest, 30, is being held on suspicion of child abduction while Megan Stammers, 15, is expected to return home to her relieved family by today

The Port of Dover was unavailable for comment when the MailOnline contacted them.

As police investigate how and why 
Megan was able to leave the UK while police investigated her 
relationship with Forrest, the authorities will want to know how mother-of-five Mrs Wilson's passport came into her hands.

They will also want to know what a young teenager was able to cross Europe pretending to be a 37-year-old woman.

A UK Border Agency spokesman said that the travel company which the couple used to get to France were responsible for checking passport details - but it is unclear which agency the duo used.

The shocking details emerged as it was
revealed the married man may have been planning to start a new 
life in France with schoolgirl Megan Stammers.

Hours after the pair were found 
‘strolling hand in hand’ in Bordeaux, extraordinary details emerged of 
their eight days on the run.

French
police believe they may have ‘dumped’ Forrest’s car in Paris before 
travelling 400 miles by train to the city in the south-west of the 
country.

Once there, they say married maths teacher Forrest was trying to find work as a barman before gendarmes and British police finally tracked the pair down.

They were on their way to a job interview when they were apprehended in a city centre street.

Megan was left in floods of tears  
after gendarmes swooped in the busy shopping area at lunchtime yesterday
to arrest Forrest, 30, on suspicion of child abduction.

She
was taken into protective custody as her overjoyed family – who have 
now spoken to Megan by telephone – prepared for an emotional reunion.

The 15-year-old’s stepfather Martin Stammers said he was ‘over the moon’.

‘I’m
thrilled and overjoyed. The most amazing thing is the joy I feel in 
here,’ he added, pointing to his heart. ‘You can’t describe the 
feeling.’

Megan and Forrest
sparked an international manhunt after boarding a cross-Channel ferry 
last Thursday, 24 hours after the teacher was told he was due to be 
suspended.

Staff at the 
Bishop Bell C of E School in Eastbourne, East Sussex are believed to 
have alerted British police to their concerns about the relationship 
between teacher and pupil.

Despite
this, the pair were able to travel to France, and until yesterday the 
last confirmed sighting was CCTV footage of them arm-in-arm on the 
ferry.

Mrs Wilson has always said that she and Megan's stepfather, Martin Stammers, 43, knew 
nothing about the UK authorities being concerned about the teenager's 
closeness to Forrest.

French police piecing together their journey believe they then drove south from Calais and spent ‘a long stop-over in Paris’.

Their
black Ford Fiesta has been found abandoned in the French capital, where
they are believed to have been spotted by a British tourist last 
Sunday.

A French police 
source said: ‘They dumped their car close to a mainline station and 
headed for Bordeaux – clearly they knew the authorities were on to them.

‘They
thought they could blend into day-to-day life in Bordeaux, with reports
that Forrest had been applying for bar jobs as recently as last night.’

The pair had been in the city – a 
popular destination with British tourists, with UK newspapers widely 
available – since at least Wednesday when a witness contacted police to 
say they had been spotted, according to the local public prosecutor, 
Agnes Aubouin.

Forrest, from
Ringmer, near Lewes, was due before a judge at a private hearing in 
Bordeaux last night to be formally served with a European arrest warrant
and remanded in custody.

He
will appear at a public hearing in Bordeaux’s Court of Appeal on 
Tuesday and his fast-track extradition back to the UK is expected within
days.

According to legal 
sources in Bordeaux, Megan was staying at the British consulate in the 
city before returning home late last night or today.

Teacher and pupil 
were finally found after both sets of parents made emotional televised 
appeals begging them to make contact and return home.

The pair had been in the city – a 
popular destination with British tourists, with UK newspapers widely 
available – since at least Wednesday when a witness contacted police to 
say they had been spotted, according to the local public prosecutor, 
Agnes Aubouin.

They were stopped by police at 12.20pm UK time in the Rue Sainte-Catherine and were split up from each other.

A
Bordeaux police spokesman said: ‘They were spotted in  a street in the 
city centre. A member of the public alerted  us after recognising them 
from the media.

‘Megan is 
safe and well and under police protection. Forrest is being held in 
Bordeaux’s main police station on suspicion of child abduction.’

Thursday September 20 Megan leaves her home and tells her mother she is staying overnight at a friend’s house. She and Forrest later board the Dover to Calais ferry in his Ford Fiesta. Seen on CCTV walking arm in arm.

Friday Megan is reported missing after she fails to arrive at school. One of her friends receives a text saying she has arrived in France.

Saturday The pupil’s stepfather Martin Stammers appeals for her to get in touch saying: ‘We are worried and miss you terribly.’

Sunday Police watch Calais in the hope the pair will use their return tickets. Chief Inspector Jason Tingley, of Sussex Police, describes it as a ‘critical stage of the investigation’. The pair do not turn up.

Megan’s family and friends make appeals on social networking sites. Officers urge Forrest or the teenager to get in touch.

Monday Details emerge of a blog written by Forrest four months earlier describing a ‘moral dilemma’ he faces in a posting headed: ‘You hit me just like heroin...’ It is not known who he was talking about.

Megan’s mother, Danielle Wilson, appeals to her directly, saying: ‘I don’t care what you’ve done, I just want you home.’ Megan’s family explain she had been receiving extra maths lessons from Forrest for several months but did not suspect there was anything more to the pair’s relationship.

Tuesday The Mail reveals one of Megan’s friends had reported concerns to a teacher seven months before they vanished and education chiefs admit an investigation was under way.

Wednesday Reports suggest police had taken possession of Megan’s phone in the week she went missing.

ThursdayForrest's parents Jim and Julie Forrest appeal directly to their son to get in touch, saying: ‘We are all here for you both.  Please, please get in contact.’ BBC’s Crimewatch programme features an appeal.

YesterdayMegan found ‘safe and well’ in Bordeaux. Forrest arrested.

Forrest
was made a ‘garde a vu’ – a French legal expression which effectively 
means that  a suspect in custody and  facing charges.

A
French police source  said: ‘She is on the surface safe and well. Megan
was in tears when she was taken away from the arrested man by women 
police officers. She will remain in the care of the authorities. She 
will soon be returned to her family in Britain.’

Friends and neighbours of the family expressed their relief at the news last night. Neighbour Kersti Barnes, 37, said: ‘When I found out Megan was missing I was devastated.

‘It’s just absolutely fantastic that she’s back and thank  God nothing happened to her other than that she was with somebody else.

‘At the end of the day it could have been worse. I’m just absolutely elated for her parents’ sake because they are absolutely amazing people.’

Neighbour Kerry Davies, 40, said: ‘We are just glad that she’s safe and well.’

Neighbour Rick Smith, 26, added: ‘It’s good news. I always hoped she was safe, I didn’t imagine she would be in any trouble.’
