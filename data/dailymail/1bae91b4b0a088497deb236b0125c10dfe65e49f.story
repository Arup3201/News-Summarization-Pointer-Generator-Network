Taxidermy is widely considered a strange hobby and an even stranger profession.

But one company has sought to showcase its creativity with a bizarre series of stuffed squirrels in a range of elaborate poses.

The pictures show squirrels playing pool, getting to grips with a sniper rifle and even passed out drunk.

Others show the creatures dressed up and in character as Norse god Thor and engaged in an epic lightsaber battle as a Jedi Knight and Sith Lord from Star Wars. 

Teeters' Taxidermy Studio aims to come up with 'new and interesting' ideas to challenge themselves with.

This has led to increasingly zany designs - some of which are for sale on eBay for as much as $600.

Owner Corin Teeters, from Halifax, Pennsylvania, runs the shop which also deals with traditional taxidermy for local hunters. 

But he views these works, created for fun, as an art form.

He said: 'We're always bouncing ideas off each other, often late into the night. 

'We are always trying to think outside the box and create a conversation.

Posed: But Mr Teeter's adds he is lucky that some customers drop animals off and say 'surprise us'

'There are many taxidermists out there that do exceptional work and inspire us and I hope we give them something to think about as well.

'I've also been very fortunate to have clients that drop their animals off and say surprise us. This let us be more creative in what we give back.'

Mr Teeters is careful not to create works too outlandish for his conservative customers, but still strives for uniqueness.

The 39-year-old said: 'We try not to cross the line with people but we can still give them a piece of art.'

'We have worked on just about every animal legally taken in North America and Africa along with a few other countries.

'We have also worked on pets and even some protected animals for museums and schools for educational purposes.'

Mr Teeters has notched up over 20 years of experience often logging 60 hours weeks. 

Each piece takes about ten hours of hands-on work as well as a few months in the freeze dryer.

'The work is always different and there's nothing like seeing a satisfied customer,' he added.

Pass out: Mr Teeters says he considers the works as a form of art, but adds: 'We try not to cross the line with people but we can still give them a piece of art'
