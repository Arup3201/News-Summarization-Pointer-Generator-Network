A mother who decapitated her two-year-old son before stabbing herself to death in a crazed murder suicide had smoked marijuana laced with PCP just before the attack it’s been revealed.

A toxicology test confirmed Chevronne 
Thomas, 34, had smoked the dangerous hallucinogenic last August making the third time authorities say the mother used the drug around her son in Camden, New Jersey.

Thomas lost custody of the boy in 2010 and 2011 because of the drug use - once telling police she misplaced her baby while high - before he was returned to her care just four months before his murder.

Murder suicide: A toxicology test confirmed that Chevonne Thomas, 34, had smoked marijuana and PCP just before decapitating her two-year-old son Zahree, right, and then killing herself last August

Police say that just five months after Thomas was reunited with her son in April, found to be fit to care for him by state workers, she carried out the gruesome attack before panicking and calling 911.

Two-year-old Zahree's headless body was found on the ground floor of Thomas' apartment with the mother in an upstairs bedroom.

Police tried to talk her into surrendering but she slashed her own throat and died before police could reach her.

Inside the home's freezer police said they discovered the toddler's head.

State workers with the Department of Children and Families say Thomas had received counselling, had passed drug screenings and was visited by state workers.

But there are new questions on the regularity of those visits and if she truly was found fit to care for her son.

Grisly scene: When police arrived at Thomas' home in New Jersey, they found the little boy's headless body on the ground floor of her apartment with Thomas moments later slashing her own throat upstairs

Tragic attack: The boy's head was found in the home's freezer after the third known drug use by the mother while around her child who had only been returned to her in April

Eerie silence: An air conditioner is seen on the roof of Thomas' home, along with a torn out screen and broken blinds after that tragic August night

State officials say they are now investigating the case.

'It's not just getting the facts on this case. It's about getting information on how very young children are being protected in New Jersey,' Cecilia Zalkind, executive director for Advocates for Children of New Jersey, told Philly.com.

'There are still many unanswered questions, especially about visitation. How often did the mother and child visit prior to reunification?’ she added, stressing the importance of visitation to determine a safe transition back to the home.

Since the attack authorities have released the 911 call of the mother admitting her crime to a dispatcher while rambling and repeatedly contradicting herself.

She first blames her boyfriend for killing her son before admitting to it, saying multiple times: 'I'm lying, I'm lying, I'm lying, I did it.'

She also revealed she was taking Prozac but had not taken it that day.

A neighbour said she saw Thomas sitting on the steps of her home earlier in the night topless and crying with her boyfriend.

Police received the call around 12.30am from a woman about a domestic dispute.

No one else was in the home when this happened. Thomas has another child who was not at home at the time.

Prosecutors say Thomas had lost
custody of Zahree in 2010 when she left the boy 
unattended in a car.

She admitted she had smoked marijuana laced with PCP before blacking out in a park.

Camden, which lies across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, has been plagued by poverty and high crime rates.

Records show Thomas was arrested last year on charges of endangering the welfare of a child.
