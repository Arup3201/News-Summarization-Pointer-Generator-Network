A new study has found that fliers only have 'some' chance of access to Wi-Fi on 24 per cent of global flights

In the U.S., the figure is higher with at least 66 per cent of flighta having at least 'some' chance of Wi-Fi, according to a report by New York-based Routehappy.

This compares to Routehappy's last report, in June 2013, which found Wi-Fi connectivity on less than half of domestic flights.

Overall, it found that Virgin America had the the highest percentage of total flights and flight miles with Wi-Fi. Southwest came in at second and JetBlue third.

However, Delta Air Lines had the largest total number of flights with Wi-Fi, followed by American Airlines.

'Coverage is starting to be meaningful on flights worldwide, along with a wide variety of speeds, coverage availability, and pricing models, including free of charge.'

But customers can be stung by the price.

A study in October by Cheapflights.co.uk revealed that Middle Eastern carriers Emirates and Etihad are charging the lowest tariffs for inflight WiFi at around $2.60 and $4.70 per hour, respectively.

Of the 20 carriers included in the study, Turkish Airlines was the only one that does not charge a fee for wifi, while nine did not offer it at all. 

In November, a man said he was charged $1,171.46 on a Singapore Airlines flight, from London to Singapore, after he signed up for a $30 package. 

However, he quickly exceeded the 30-megabyte limit, which he said happened mostly while he was napping.
