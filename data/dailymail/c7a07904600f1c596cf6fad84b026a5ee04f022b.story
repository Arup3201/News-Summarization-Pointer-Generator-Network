A disgraced elderly undertaker has walked free from court after admitting groping a woman's breasts at a funeral.

Shamed funeral director Charles Ashton also made lewd comments about the woman's figure before even kissing her on the lips, a court heard.

Handing Ashton a £600 fine, District Judge Roy Anderson told the 83-year-old his reputation was 'shredded' - but spared him jail because of his old age.

Judge Anderson told the defendant: 'You are a respected undertaker but you have brought on yourself the utmost shame and disgrace.

'She found herself the victim of a nasty piece of sexual pestering from you, the effects of which plainly remain with her to this day.

'Were it not for your age I should be dealing with you in a far more robust way. But I'm prepared to deal with you now by way of a financial penalty.

'Your reputation has been shredded and that seems to me to be something I should take into account.'

Prosecuting at Leeds Magistrates Court, Amanda Harris described how the incident happened at a crematorium in Leeds, West Yorkshire, during a service conducted by the business he owns with his sons.

Prosecutor, Amanda Harris, said: 'He asked her to sit beside him and she agreed out of politeness.

'He placed his arms around her and grabbed her shoulder while making sexual comments to her and two witnesses, including "you don't get many of those to the gallon," making reference to her breasts.'

Mrs Harris said Ashton squeezed the woman's right breast and pulled her head towards him and kissed her on the cheek.

Mrs Harris added: 'He told her he wanted a proper kiss and placed his lips on hers.'

Defence lawyer Stephen Swan said: 'It was a moment of madness. He is at a loss to explain... From the outset he has had real concern for the victim.

'From his perspective, it's been completely devastating. I think it's a measure of him that he is so upset about what's happened.'

Mr Swan said Ashton, of Castleford, West Yorkshire, still helps out five-days-a-week at the business in the town, which is now run by his sons.

District Judge Anderson handed Ashton a £600 fine and told him to pay £85 towards prosecution costs.

The judge added: 'For what it's worth I'm prepared to believe you will not appear in court again charged with this sort of offence.

'But if you do, then I give you the clearest indication that you will face a far more severe penalty.'

Ashton, who admitted sexual assault by touching, must also pay the woman £1,000 compensation and a five-year restraining order was imposed, banning him from contacting her directly or indirectly.

On leaving court Ashton asked reporters: 'Are you going to hang me? Are you going to hang me again?'
