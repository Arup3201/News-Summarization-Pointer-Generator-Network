A young cyclist died after swerving off the road and crashing into a house during a training session.

University graduate Rebecca Scott, 24, of Clyst St Mary, near Exeter, Devon, was travelling down a hill in training for a 100-mile endurance race when she lost control and veered towards the building.

Her father Alan was cycling behind and heard the impact as she crashed into the side wall, suffering multiple injuries. He called paramedics, who tried to revive Miss Scott before pronouncing her dead.

Mr Scott said that his daughter’s mother Sue, 52, and her younger brother Matthew, 21, have all been left devastated by her death, which happened in Branscombe, Devon, at 2pm last Saturday.

He added: ‘She lost control on a descent and had an accident. I did not see the point of impact. She went past me and I heard the accident but I was there beside her within seconds.

‘There was a nurse there. Paramedics then arrived, as did the air ambulance, but there was nothing they could do for her.’

Fitness-obsessed Miss Scott, who graduated from Falmouth University, completed the Great West Run half-marathon road race aged 17 and was a keen member of the Exeter Triathlon Club.

She worked at an insurance firm in Exeter and her latest challenge was going to be the Lochaber 100, a 100-mile cycling challenge taking place in Scotland at the end of this month.

Mr Scott said: ‘The reason she was out 
on Saturday was she was training. She wanted to get some miles in. She 
had done some with her mother in the morning and cycled down to do some 
with me in the afternoon.

'She went past me and I heard the accident but I was there beside her within seconds'

‘As a family we love our sport and both myself and Rebecca’s mother have taken part in triathlons. Rebecca just got drawn into it when she came back from university. She was also well-known as a marshal at local running and cycling events.’

Kevin Bawn, the principal of her former school, Clyst Vale Community College, said: ‘Our thoughts and condolences are with Becky’s family.

‘She was a clever, conscientious and hard-working student, with great sensitivity and energy.’

Chairman of Clyst St Mary parish council, Mike Norman, added: ‘I am sure the whole community will get behind me to offer our condolences to the family over their sad loss.
