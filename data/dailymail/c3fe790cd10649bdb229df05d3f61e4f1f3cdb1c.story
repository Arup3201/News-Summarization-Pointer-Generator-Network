Trapped: Sarah took pictures on her phone of her trying the locked doors as she chronicled her predicament online

Bid for freedom: Stranded inside, Sarah spent hours tweeting pictures and messages from the church

The mother-of-two wrote: 'I'm locked in inside St.Andrews Church! I was in private praying chapel & when I came out, everyone was gone & doors locked. #Plymouth #help'Â 

She later added: 'Trying to think of best way to get out of this church with minimum disruption. It's quite calm & peaceful in here so in no hurry #Plymouth'

Mrs Greep spent the next few hours cataloging her bid for freedom, also using her phone to find a number for the church caretaker.

Cry for help: Stuck in the church, Sarah took to Twitter to see if she ask for assistance

Concern: Other local Twitter users picked up on Sarah's predicament and began replying to her tweets

Mrs Greep said: 'I realised I was locked in so I started going through my phone book, thinking of all the people I could contact.

'But it was a lovely day outside, I thought most people would be out enjoying the weather. I didn't want to bother anyone so I just started tweeting.'

Mrs Greep said she tried to phone a 
few telephone numbers for church volunteers on the back of a leaflet 
within the building but couldn't get through.

She
said: 'I tried the doors but they were locked. I spotted some wine, too
- I thought God probably wouldn't mind if I had some, if it really came
to it, but in the end someone came and rescued me.'

The
businesswoman said she would have had to wait another four hours for 
the 6.30pm service had her tweets - and a video she posted online during
her stay - not been spotted by helpful locals.

She
added: 'I can't think of many better places to be stuck. It was so 
peaceful, I was all by myself, the sun was shining through the window - 
though I wouldn't have been quite so calm at night.'
