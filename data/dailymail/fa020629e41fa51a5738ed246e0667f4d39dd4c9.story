Snoop Dogg is 'facing a lawsuit' after posting a picture mocking the appearance of a gay man on Instagram - but the rapper's followers have pointed out that the pair look alike.

Snoop posted a picture of carer Cortez Booze on the social media site on Saturday along with the words: 'Whose auntcle is this?'

Since the post was made, Mr Booze has faced a torrent of abuse online, with people calling him a 'shemale', 'confused', and 'ugly'.

'Whose auntcle is this?' Snoop Dogg posted a picture on Instagram of carer Cortez Booze, who then received torrents of abuse

Dozens of people commented on the post, which was liked by more than 39,000 people.

One Instagram user said: 'That shemale ain't gone win. U get wat u get if u choose to dress how u dress. Consequences for your choices so use some common sense.'

But others thought that Mr Booze had a similar appearance to Snoop Dogg, with one adding: 'He Looks Just Like Yu Snoop.' 

Mr Booze, who works at a care home in Edgewater, Maryland, told TMZ that he planned on suing Snoop Dogg, otherwise known as Snoop Lion, because of the homophobic abuse he received.

Mr Booze now plans to sue the rapper over the post, which has been removed from Snoop Dogg's Instagram

He has also asked Instagram bosses to remove the offending image. It was removed from the site today.

In November, Snoop Dogg asked the same 'auntcle' question after posting an image of a person wearing a bra.

Snoop Dogg's representatives were unavailable for comment.
