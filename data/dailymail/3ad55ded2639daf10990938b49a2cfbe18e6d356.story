Former Scotland captain David Weir - who was in the last Scotland team to face England on Scottish soil, in November 1999 - insists that England remain a force to be reckoned with on the international stage, despite Roy Hodgson’s men being a national embarrassment at the World Cup.

Weir played in both legs of the Euro 2000 qualifying play-off 15 years ago. In the first leg at Hampden, two goals from Paul Scholes put England 2-0 up. Scotland then shocked England at Wembley, winning 1-0, a deserved victory but not enough for progress.

The fortunes of both international sides have dipped since then. Scotland have not been to any major finals since the France ’98 World Cup. England have reached the quarter-finals at World Cups and Euros but the limp winless exit from Brazil showed how low their stock has fallen.

But Weir insists England have a crop of players many nations envy - and they will come good in time.

‘Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling, Danny Welbeck, Jack Wilshere, Ross Barkley - these are talents any country in the world would be interested in,’ he says. ‘It’s a bit of myth that there is little or no talent there. There is. It’s a matter of letting it come to fruition.

‘Pick a team, stand by it, give it a chance to bond and have faith instead of chopping and changing after a couple of bad games.

‘And then there’s Wayne Rooney, who is the best player England have had in a generation.’

Weir know the young Rooney when they both played for Everton. ‘At 15 years old, he was confident, sure of himself, a nice guy, worked hard, trained hard, loved football,’ Weir says. ‘He’s the same now. He’ll play anywhere, he’s got great qualities as a player.’

Weir was a 29-year-old centre-half in his first full season at Everton when Scotland lost the play-off double-header in 1999. He is now the 44-year-old assistant manager at Championship Brentford, having played in a European final and won silverware at Rangers and been Sheffield United manager in between.

He has seen Scotland’s fortunes dwindle over the past 15 years, although he believes they may have turned a corner, and he has seen England’s dwindle too, although insists England have not fallen as far as many perceive.

And as the pair prepare to face each other at Celtic Park in tonight’s friendly, he thinks the way in which the respective domestic leagues have become tougher to crack for home-grown players may be one reason their national sides have faltered.

‘The level in the Premier League certainly got higher, and it got harder for [British] players to get games,’ he says. ‘It got harder in the Scottish Premier League too. I’m not sure the level got higher there but it got harder for a young Scottish player to get a game because there were more foreign players, and bigger money to foreign players.

‘Looking back now that didn’t necessarily help Scotland in the long term.’

The Hampden leg in 1999 was ‘an occasion of huge magnitude’, Weir says. ‘Scotland at the time were used to qualifying for major championships. We’d been at Euro 96 and the World Cup in 1998 so were expecting to go to the Euros again in 2000. So it was massive pair of games and one we thought we had a chance in.’

England’s XI still was still formidable enough that many rival nations would have coveted the spine: David Seaman, Tony Adams, Paul Ince, Scholes, Alan Shearer. David Beckham was on the wing. Michael Owen partnered Shearer.

It was the day before Scholes’s 25th birthday and he scored his first goal in the 21st minute from a cross by Sol Cambell on the right, chesting down in the ‘D’, running on and lashing home right-foot from the edge of the six-yard box.

England manager Kevin Keegan jumped in joy, arms aloft, as he did when Scholes got his second, this time from a Beckham cross, a header converted six yards out.

‘A bit of quality,’ recalls Weir, summing up the difference in the sides back then. ‘A massive atmosphere went from being very big to very quiet, very quickly.’

Scotland’s captain was Colin Hendry, and alongside Weir were seasoned Scottish players with big-tournament experience - Dodds, Burley, Gallacher, Hutchison, Collins. The manager was Craig Brown. ‘He said after we lost the first leg we still had a chance at Wembley,’ Weir recalls.

Scotland famously won, Don Hutchison scoring and Christian Dailly almost making it two.

Weir says Scotland have the ability for another upset today. ‘I think we’re competitive again now,’ he says.

Weir thinks the ‘friendly’ nature of the match will favour Scotland. ‘[In competitive games] maybe Scotland are a bit more emotional and caught up in the atmosphere rather than clinical and executing a plan,’ he says.

‘Being a friendly will maybe relax things a bit, let them play with freedom and not get caught up in the emotion.’

Not like 15 years ago.
