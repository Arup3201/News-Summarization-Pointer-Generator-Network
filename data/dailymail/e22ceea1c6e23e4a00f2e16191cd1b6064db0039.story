A British fisherman made the catch of a lifetime while on a fishing holiday in Canada.

Peter Starbuck, 78, from Oswestry, Shropshire, travelled to British Columbia  to catch salmon, but stunned locals when he ended up reeling in a 350lb sturgeon.

The giant fish was so heavy that it towed his boat for half an hour before the pensioner was able to pull his catch in.

'It looked like a scene from Jaws': The 78-year-old is more used to catching trout with his fly rod, but managed to hang on while the giant sturgeon towed his boat for over an hour.

Canadian guide Steve Kaye couldn't believe the catch and  snapped a picture before Peter released the giant back into the water.

Mr Starbuck said: 'It looked like a scene from Jaws!

'It was the second time we went out, just myself and the guide, and I caught a fish after an hour.

'I could feel it getting more weight on the line and thought maybe I'd caught a big one.

'Steve said we'd bring it in, and he cut off some of the line so we could pull it in. It towed us down the river for an hour and eventually it got close enough that we could beat it.

'It was actually like being in the gym on the weight machine, and you think you're going to do 20 reps, but the fish was saying you get off when I tell you. It's pulling on your back and also really your whole body. You have to be aware of not being pulled off the boat.' 

Mr Starbuck, who runs his own business, started fishing in the early 1970s. After fly fishing for trout for 20 years he moved on to fishing for salmon.

Although on a salmon-fishing trip in British Colombia, Mr Starbuck took some time out to travel to the Fraser River to try his hand at catching white sturgeon, a freshwater fish species native to North America.

The fish are known to reach a maximum weight of more than 1,500lb and can grow up to 20ft long.

Mr Starbuck added: 'It was really that exciting. It was a marvellous experience and this time I can tell the story of the one that didn't get away.

'My dream was to get on about my own weight – that was my fantasy.

'When it turned out to be 25 stone I couldn't believe it.

'I went to British Columbia two years ago to catch salmon, last year I went back and someone suggested I should try fishing for sturgeon, and this year I decided to give it a go.

'After this I'm definitely planning to go back next year!'
