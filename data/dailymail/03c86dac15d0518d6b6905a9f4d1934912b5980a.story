A new series of female action figures seeks to break the mold by creating hero archetypes with more believable bodies and a positive, nonviolent message for young girls.

IAmElemental Action Figures for Girls has raised nearly triple its funding requirement on Kickstarter – due to its interest in creating a ‘positive and fierce reinterpretation of the traditional female action figure,’ its campaign explains.

The idea for the line came about after its creators Julie Kerwin and Dawn Nadeau of New York ‘discovered that the typical female action figure on the market today is not actually designed for girls at all (or even boys). Instead, most are created for the adult male collector, decidedly more Hooters than Heroine.’

New world order: IAmElemental is a new range of action figures intended to send positive messages to young girls

Different body: The line seeks to retool the typical female figure form, which typically boasts a large chest and unrealistically small waist

In plainer terms, female action figures are typically outfitted with enormous breasts and a tiny waist. IAmElemental seeks to change this with figures that boast a more believable chest and body type.

Ms Kerwin and Ms Nadeau have formatted their range of seven figurines as a periodic table of elements, called ‘The Elements of Power’.

Each character is named for its positive, nonviolent superpower, including: Bravery, energy, honesty, industry, enthusiasm, persistence, and fear.

The four-inch-tall figures have nine points of articulation – their neck, shoulders, elbows, knees, and hips all bend. Each one comes wearing armor, as well as a removable accessory and a shield.

Scientific approach: The seven figurines are members of their own periodic table of elements - which include behaviors like bravery and honesty

Their individual retail price has not yet been set. There is also no word of when they may hit store shelves.

With still 19 days left of crowd funding left to go, IAmElemental has already raised more than $101,500 – nearly triple its $35,000 pledge goal.

The brand’s inventors both attended Wellesley College. Ms Kerwin is a mother of two and works as a music producer. Ms Nadeau is also a mother of two and works as a marketing professional.
