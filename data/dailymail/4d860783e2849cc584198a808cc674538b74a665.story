A jury has criticised the Army for safety failings after a soldier on a training exercise using live ammunition was shot dead when a colleague’s jammed machine gun suddenly fired.

James Wilkinson, 21, from Whitefield, Greater Manchester, a fusilier with 2nd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was hit in the neck in Kenya in 2011 after a senior officer failed to follow policy.

Two soldiers, Fusilier Colin Bell and Pte Patrick Price, were convicted of negligence and later jailed. Both men were also dismissed from service but were allowed to remain in the forces on demoted ranks - Bell was a corporal and Price a staff sergeant - after Appeal Court judges reduced their sentences.

An inquest jury has delivered a narrative verdict  - where the details of death are recorded but no one is name as responsible for the death - after four days of evidence.

The gun, which was being used by Fusilier Aaron Davenport, jammed during firing. Acting contrary to army safety procedures, it was taken behind the frontline to Fusilier Bell, but fired as he removed the barrel to clear the blockage, the inquest heard.

Pte Price was acting in a safety support role.

Giving evidence, Fusilier Bell admitted the weapon should have remained with Fusilier Davenport and said that he should have treated it as dangerous because it would not cock. He also said an armourer should have been called.

Simon Nelson, the coroner, ruled that the jury could not name individuals or use words which could imply judgment in a civil or criminal context in its decision.

They ruled the order to take the gun behind the row of soldiers was ‘inappropriate and ill-judged’. The jury also criticised ‘insufficient training’ and hit out at ‘ambiguous language’ during training, adding: ‘The major safety factor omitted was thought to be the safe direction of the weapon while attempting to clear the stoppage.’

Newlywed Fusilier Wilkinson, who leaves a widow Sarah, daughter Annabel and stepson Connor, was hit as he was lying on the ground.

His father Robert, 47, described the verdict as ‘irrelevant’ and said the family were ‘absolutely disgusted’ with the Appeal Court ruling.

He said: ‘Ultimately James was failed by his colleagues and as a result of their actions or lack of, we are serving a life sentence. We cannot accept what has happened due to these men failing to carry out procedures they are taught on a regular basis. Training does not override safety.’

Mr Wilkinson also hit out at the Army because Fusilier Wilkinson’s mobile phone was not returned after his death.

He added: ‘Never a day goes by without us thinking of James.’

Fusilier Wilkinson’s widow Sarah spoke of her anger over his death – and said the family hasn’t received an apology.

They were married for just four months and he never got to see his daughter Annabel.

Mrs Wilkinson, 23, is pursuing a civil claim for damages against the Ministry of Defence. She said: ‘It has been devastating to find out exactly how utterly preventable the incident was and though I am glad to hear there have been amendments made to safety drills in light of what happened, I am still absolutely disgusted that there has been no justice throughout this process.

‘I just wish the men responsible were no longer able to serve in the forces so an example could be made of them and lessons learned. It is obvious to all that serious mistakes were made.

‘I will never get over losing James. He was my whole world and I miss him immensely.’

Solicitor Deirdre Healy from the law firm Pannone, now part of Slater & Gordon, confirmed she is pursuing legal action against the MOD on behalf of Mrs Wilkinson.

The Ministry of Defence has admitted liability for the incident and will not contest any personal injury claim from the family.

A spokesman added: 'Our thoughts remain with Fusilier Wilkinson’s friends and family following this tragic accident. As recognised at the inquest, we have accepted and implemented all the necessary recommendations that came out of the investigation into the accident so that we can try to prevent something like this from ever happening again.'
