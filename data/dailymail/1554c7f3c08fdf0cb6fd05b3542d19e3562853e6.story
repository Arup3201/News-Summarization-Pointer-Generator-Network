Jose Mourinho is used to winning at Chelsea - and his record as boss is so impressive that he has become the quickest ever to reach 400 Premier League points.

During his two spells at Stamford Bridge, Mourinho has been in charge of 174 matches, racking up 401 points in the process.

His latest victory was against Hull City - 2-0 on Saturday with Eden Hazard and Diego Costa scoring the goals.

Sir Alex Ferguson took 191 games with Manchester United to reach the 400-point milestone, while Arsene Wenger hit the same mark after 208 matches with Arsenal.

Rafael Benitez (209 matches), Gerard Houllier (235), Kenny Dalglish (235) and David O'Leary (255) follow behind the Premier League's three most-successful managers.

Mourinho's first spell at Stamford Bridge saw him win the Premier League title in 2005 and 2006 - his first two seasons in charge of the Blues - before leaving in 2007.

He then returned to west London in the summer of 2013 and guided the club to third in the table last season.

But now his Chelsea side have won all eight of their Premier League home matches and have lost just one game all season - highlighting Mourinho's dominance of the English top flight.

In all, his Premier League record reads: Played 174, won 122, drawn 35, lost 17.

Ferguson's Manchester United side were all-conquering until Mourinho arrived on the scene - and during the time the Portuguese boss spent with Inter Milan and Real Madrid after his first spell at Stamford Bridge - yet the Scot took 17 extra games to reach the 400-point mark.

Wenger was also widely considered to be the best foreign coach ever to manage in England before Mourinho rose to prominence, but the Frenchman took a full 34 extra matches to claim 400 Premier League points.
