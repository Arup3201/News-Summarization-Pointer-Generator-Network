The Russian rouble collapsed to a record low yesterday as the country’s economic crisis deepened.

The Central Bank of Russia raised interest rates from 10.5 to 17 per cent in a desperate effort to prop up the currency.

But the move triggered panic among international investors and the rouble tumbled by as much as 21 per cent against the US dollar.

Money worries: Russia dramatically raised its interest rate from 10.5 to 17 per cent in a desperate effort to prevent the collapse of the rouble and boost the economy. Many experts believe the decline in the economy could eventually lead to President Vladmir Putin being ousted from office

The crisis could weaken President Vladimir Putin’s iron grip on power as analysts warned the currency was in ‘free-fall’.

‘Russia is in a full-blown currency crisis,’ said Alexander Moseley, a fund manager at Schroders, the asset management firm.

Harry Adams, managing director of the foreign exchange specialist Argentex, said the rouble had turned to ‘rubble’.

The rouble has fallen by nearly 60 per cent against the dollar this year on the back of the tumbling oil price and worries about the outlook for the Russian economy.

Oil and gas account for 70 per cent of Russian exports and half of government revenues, making the country vulnerable to falling prices.

Crude fell below $59 a barrel yesterday for the first time since May 2009, having traded at $115 as recently as June.

The lower oil price and sanctions imposed on Russia by the West for its land grab in Ukraine have left its fragile economy on the brink of recession.

Apple has halted online sales of its iPhones, iPads and other products in Russia amid financial turmoil triggered by the steep decline in the country's currency. 

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, said yesterday that the ruble's instability has made it too difficult to set its prices in Russia, prompting the closure of its online store there.

A spokesman told Bloomberg: 'Our online store in Russia is currently unavailable while we review pricing. We apologise to customers for any inconvenience.' 

The ruble plunged by as much as 20 per cent yesterday, even after Russia's central bank increased interest rates sharply in an attempt to shore up the currency.

A one point yesterday, a dollar was worth nearly 80 roubles – compared with around 30 at the start of the year – rekindling memories of Russia’s 1998 financial crisis, when the currency collapsed and the country was forced to default on its debts.

The current crisis has piled pressure on Mr Putin. ‘The pieces are falling into place to start to affect the political sustainability of this regime,’ said Nicholas Spiro, of the London consultancy Spiro Sovereign Strategy.

Russia’s central bank predicts that the economy will contract by 4.5 per cent in 2015 if oil prices average $60 a barrel throughout the year. The slump in the rouble has driven inflation above 9 per cent by making imports more expensive, and this will hit families and businesses.

Sergei Shvetsov, deputy governor of the central bank, said in Moscow yesterday: ‘I couldn’t imagine even a year ago that such a thing would happen, even in my wildest dreams. The situation is critical.’

Lavrov insisted: 'I can assure you that Russia will not only survive but we will come out stronger. We have been in much worse situations in our history and every time, we got out of those fixes much stronger. This will happen this time.'

Overnight, Russia had dramatically raised its interest rate from 10.5 to 17 per cent  in a desperate effort to prevent the collapse of the rouble and boost its stricken economy.

The surprise announcement was made at 1am Moscow time and comes after the rouble's value has sunk roughly 50 per cent since January - battered by plunging worldwide oil prices and Western sanctions imposed over the conflict in Ukraine.

The move is Russia' largest single rise since 1998, when interest rates soared past 100 per cent and the government defaulted on debt.

Russia's economy is threatened by paralysis as the tumbling value of its currency pushes inflation to dangerous levels. The overnight action has somewhat allayed fears, however, prompting an immediate gain in the rouble and leaving it 1.6 per cent up on the Asian stock market.

The Bank of Russia's aggressive move illustrated the size of the economic perils confronting Russia and reflected fears that the ruble's decline could trigger consumer panic and incite a run on banks.

By raising interest rates, the central bank hopes investors will find it more financially appealing to keep their money in Russia rather than moving it to Western Europe, Asia or the United States.

'They did it as a lure to encourage people to keep their rubles at home rather than continue to flee the currency and the country,' said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California.

'It's a way of buying time. It doesn't solve any of the underlying issues that the Russian economy has,' he added, referring to falling energy prices, Western sanctions and widespread corruption.

Such challenges are especially difficult because Russia's economy relies so heavily on petroleum revenue and lacks the diversification to withstand severe economic downturns. 

That tends to leave Russia at the mercy of global financial markets, where oil is priced in dollars.

The average price of a barrel of oil has dropped below $56 from a summer high of $107.

The Russian government recently downgraded its growth forecast for next year, predicting that the economy will sink into recession. Still, the Bank of Russia's latest action carries dangers of its own.

By jacking up rates to try to contain inflation, it risks inflicting further economic damage, Eichengreen noted. Though high interest rates can attract investor money, they can also stifle growth by making it harder for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend.

The announcement in Moscow came after U.S. and European markets had closed. 

Stocks have suffered in recent days amid the steady drop in global oil prices. The sell-off could continue if investors view the Bank of Russia's move as ineffective.

The central bank has gradually raised the rate from 5.5 per cent early this year to 17 per cent now.

Last Thursday, it tried unsuccessfully to stem the ruble's slide by boosting its key rate by 1 per cent point to 10.5 per cent. It cited a surge in consumer prices and a 'significant inflation risk.'

The Bank of Russia said then that it expected prices to rise 10 percent for 2014 and climb further in the first quarter of 2015. But the ruble plunged further yesterday, dropping from 55 rubles to the dollar on Thursday to about 65 rubles to the dollar by the close of the markets last night.

A falling currency increases the cost of imports, stoking inflationary pressures. At the same time, plunging oil prices limit the government's ability to fight a downturn and forces it to borrow more.

The sanctions imposed by the West have magnified Russia's economic turmoil.

In September, the United States and the European Union announced a new round of sanctions over Moscow's involvement in Ukraine, which included blocking Western financial markets to key Russian companies and limiting imports of some technologies.

The additional sanctions were expected to cause enough pain to put Russia into recession for one or two years, predicted economist Alexei Kudrin, who served as finance minister under President Vladimir Putin for 11 years until 2011.

The potential for a prolonged downturn caused investors to pull their money from the country, causing the ruble to further lose value.
