Pleading not guilty to terror charges:  Mufid Elfgeeh, of Rochester, New York, is shown here in his arrest photo from May this year

A convenience store manager from western New York accused of trying to provide material support to the Islamic State militant group pleaded not guilty in federal court on Thursday.

Mufid Elfgeeh, 30, was indicted on seven counts earlier this week, with charges ranging from helping people to travel to Syria to fight for Islamic State, which has seized swaths of Iraq and Syria, to plotting to murder American soldiers.

Elfgeeh, who remains in custody, pleaded not guilty to all seven counts during his arraignment in Rochester, New York, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jonathan Feldman, said Barbara Burns, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney for New York's Western District. 

Elfgeeh, a Rochester resident, was born in Yemen but is now a naturalized U.S. citizen.

The three charges of material support to Islamic State each carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, and the attempted murder charge carries up to a 20-year sentence.

He is due to return to court for a pretrial hearing on October 1, where prosecutors will update the court on how long it might take to complete translating the evidence into Arabic, Burns said. 

According to court records, Elfgeeh, beginning last year, tried to help three people - two of whom were cooperating with the FBI - to travel to Syria to fight for Islamic State, a Sunni militant group that has seized large areas of Iraq and Syria.

'Elfgeeh also plotted to shoot and kill members of the United States military who had returned from Iraq,' authorities said. 

'As part of the plan to kill soldiers, Elfgeeh purchased two handguns equipped with firearm silencers and ammunition from a confidential source.'

The FBI made the guns inoperable before the confidential source gave them to the suspect, the Justice Department statement said, adding Elfgeeh was in custody.

'With today's indictment of Mufid Elfgeeh, the government demonstrates that it will use all available tools to disrupt and defeat ISIS,' William Hochul, U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York, said in the statement, using an acronym for Islamic State.

Court documents revealed at the indictment also allege that Elfgeeh sent $600 via Western Union to a Yemeni man he wanted to join ISIS. 

Mufid Elfgeeh is accused of trying to provide material support to the Islamic State by helping three men who said they would travel to Syria to engage in violent jihadî alongside the group's militants, according to the Justice Department

Meanwhile, President Barack Obama is seeking to build an international coalition to fight the militant group.

The three charges of material support to Islamic State each carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, and the attempted murder charge carries up to a 20-year sentence.

The suspect also faces charges for possession of firearms and silencers.

Disrupting and holding accountable those who seek to provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations is and shall remain a critical national security priority," said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin.

Elfgeeh was arrested in May by members of the FBI's Rochester Joint Terrorism Task Force after federal authorities said he bought two handguns and two silencers as part of a plan to kill members of the U.S. armed forces returning from war, as well as Shiites in the Rochester area.

The investigation included linking Elfgeeh's home computer to tweets from alias Twitter accounts expressing support for al-Qaida, violent holy war and Sunni insurgent groups in Syria, according to court papers.

The FBI said it had been investigating Elfgeeh, a naturalized U.S. citizen, since early last year.

Information on Elfgeeh's lawyer was not immediately available.

Elfgeeh's publicly appointed defense attorney has said they had seen the indictment and would be entering a plea of not guilty in court on Thursday.

His support for the terror group was made public on social media, with Twitter postings boasting of his love of ISIS (also known as ISIL and the the Islamic State).

Elfgeeh allegedly wrote to Twitter, 'Al Qaeda said it loud and clear: we are fighting the American invasion and their hegemony over the earth and the people.'

While another message about ISIS says, (they) 'will one day rule the world with the will of Allah.'

FBI informants claim that the Yemeni-born owner of Mojoe's supermarket in Rochester wanted to help arm and supply ISIS with jihadists - setting up their travel arrangements and contacts under the codename 'going to the university'.

According to CNN federal investigators are also examining whether he had plans of his own to launch terror attacks within the United States.

According to the affidavit heard in court on Tuesday, Elfgeeh said he could kill 'five or ten already, 15, something like that ... then w will post video or another message online' in an effort to explain why he did it.

'We want ... to start shooting those who were in the Army who went to Iraq,' he said in April according to the affidavit.

Attorney General Eric Holder said the case shows the authorities are using 'all the investigative tools at our disposal'.

'We will remain aggressive in identifying and disrupting those who seek to provide support to ISIL and other terrorist groups that are bent on inflicting harm upon Americans,' Holder said.

'... We are focused on breaking up these activities on the front end, before supporters of ISIL can make good on plans to travel to the region or recruit sympathizers to this cause.'

This comes as ISIS called for attacks on targets on US soil. 

The post written on a known terrorist forum includes a list of ingredients and instructions on how to assemble a pipe bomb, with directions to set the explosives off at sites like Times Square, the Las Vegas Strip and mass-transit stations across the country.
