Brake, along with Specsavers and Romex, a
 mobile workforce management solutions company, revealed survey results 
showing that 575,000 UK drivers have points on their licence for using 
phones at the wheel or being otherwise distracted. Of these, 6.5 per 
cent have six points or more.

Meanwhile, 62 per cent of children aged between the ages of seven and 11 report being driven by someone talking on the phone and 79 per cent have seen drivers on mobile phones outside their school or home.

According to The Times, drivers talking on the phone were to blame for 548 casualties last year - 17 of which were fatal.

Brake also highlighted research showing 98 per cent of drivers are unable to divide their time without it affecting performance and that mobile phone use at the wheel as well as eating, drinking and smoking are all proven to increase the risk of a crash.

Brake deputy chief executive Julie Townsend said: ‘We're living in an age when being constantly connected is the norm. More and more of us have smartphones, and find it hard to switch off, even for a minute.

‘While there are enormous benefits to this new technology, it's also posing dangerous temptations to drivers to divert their concentration away from the critical task at hand, often putting our most vulnerable road users in danger.

‘Many people who wouldn't dream of drink-driving are succumbing to using their phone and other distractions while driving, oblivious that the effect can be similar and the consequences just as horrific.’
