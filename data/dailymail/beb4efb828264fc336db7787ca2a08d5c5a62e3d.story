And now, hoping to spice up the quintessentially British label, urban chic style star Caroline Issa has unveiled an exciting new capsule collection with the brand.

Issa is the fashion director and publisher of the very cool Tank magazine, and also a front row favourite of style bloggers thanks to her unique style.

Exciting news: Urban chic style star Caroline Issa has unveiled an exciting new capsule collection with LK Bennett, favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge and Samantha Cameron

Raised in Montreal to a Chinese mother 
and Lebanese/ Iranian father, Caroline's cultural history is rich and now she is hoping to translate that onto her collection.

Currently the publisher of Tank magazine as well as a seasoned fashion week 'frower' and blogger, Caroline will be adding bang on trend hot, neon Thai inspired embroidery 
puffs in captivating colours to the collection.

The vibrant range consists of six pairs of shoes and two bags, ranging from statement sandals, anklestrap stilettos, shoe boots, the kitten heel, 
and a loafer as well as catch-me-if-you can clutches.

Travel inspiration: Caroline took inspiration from her travels to Thailand when creating the Oriental prints for her designs

Fresh off the catwalk, she has incorporated delicate 
and striking oriental flowers and zig-zags to add some summer-time 
glamour and serve as a nod to Thailand, where she has spent some of her favourite holidays.

Speaking about the collaboration, she said: 'I was excited to work on a
capsule shoe collection with L.K. Bennett, a brand I admire for their 
craftsmanship and fantastic value.

'My style philosophy has always been 
about letting your shoes do the talking - so I tend to dress with shoes 
as the starting point.

'I worked with their brilliant design team to 
dream up shoes I'd have fun wearing this coming Spring and thought their
quintessentially British take on an exotic inspiration would be a 
fabulous combination, and I'm so pleased with how they came out.

'With 
this capsule collection, the shoes will complete any office or cocktail 
outfit in seconds - and bonus: I'll just have to look down at my feet to
be transported onto the beaches of Thailand!'

Mid-priced range: The collection will be priced from £245 (shoes) and £275 (bags)

L.K.Bennett's CEO Didier 
Drouet added: 'I'm delighted with our collaborative project with 
Caroline, it gives added flavour to our existing collections – 
showcasing striking designs that embody her renowned style aesthetic.'

The collection will be priced from £245 (shoes) and £275 (bags). As well
