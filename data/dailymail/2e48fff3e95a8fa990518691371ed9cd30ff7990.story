Swaggering George Zimmerman grinned after he collected his personal items from a police station - and walked out side by side with the girlfriend he was charged with attacking.

The couple were pictured smiling broadly while leaving Sanford Police Department together where they both picked up their belongings which had been confiscated by detectives.

A police department employee escorted the couple back to their car carrying a sealed evidence box in her left hand - thought to contain a handgun.

Mr
 Zimmerman, 30, who was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin, had his five guns seized after being arrested last month
 and charged with domestic assault after a fight with girlfriend 
Samantha Scheibe, 27.

Yesterday,
 the pair had both picked up their guns and ammunition from the Seminole
 County Sheriff’s Office together – her’s were seized at the time as 
well, according to the New York Daily News.

Ms Scheibe seemed reluctant to be seen with Zimmerman, covering her face after noticing awaiting photographers.

Ms Scheibe called police November 18 
to report that Mr Zimmerman had pointed a shot gun at her in their home –
 leading to police to arrest him and seize his firearms.

‘You put your gun in my freakin' face!’ Ms Scheibe yelled at her infamous boyfriend during the 911 call. ‘Get out of my house. Do not push me out of my house. Please get out of my house,’ she continued.

‘He
 pushed me out of my house and locked me out… He knows how to do this, 
he knows how to play this game,’ she told the dispatcher.

Cops took a .380-caliber handgun, a 
9-mm handgun, a Glock 19 handgun, a Kel-Tec 12-gauge shotgun and an 
AR-15 assault-style rifle that belonged to Mr Zimmerman, according to 
the New York Daily News.

He also recovered more than 100 rounds of ammunition taken by authorities as well.

Mr Zimmerman was also famously served divorce papers by his estranged wife Shellie Zimmerman while sitting in jail before posting bail.

The blonde was not injured during the altercation, but was clearly shaken by his aggressive behaviour.

A friend of Ms Schiebe’s told MailOnline in the days after the altercation that many feared the relationship would end badly.

‘We would all talk about where the relationship was going, and we knew it would end badly,’ the woman said. ‘He is just a time bomb waiting to go off.'

Her comments echoed those of Lake Mary police chief Steve Bracknell, who also agreed via email to a concerned resident that Mr Zimmerman is ‘a ticking time bomb.’

Given the latest developments, in which Ms Schiebe did an about-face and denied Mr Zimmerman ever pointed the gun at her, authorities had no choice but to give him back his guns.

A Lake Mary Police spokesperson told MailOnline earlier this year that though there is the perception that Mr Zimmerman is a threat, authorities have no choice but to allow him to have his guns unless he is convicted of a crime that would bar him from doing so.
