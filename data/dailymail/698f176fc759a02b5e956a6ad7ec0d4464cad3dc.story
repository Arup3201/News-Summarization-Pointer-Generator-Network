A 16 year old who is accused of killing his father with a cane and hiding the body in a backyard compost bin was charged as an adult in the crime on Friday.

Rylan Salzman, from Tacoma, Washington, plead not guilty to one count of second-degree murder in the death of his father, Richard Salzman.

Richard Salzman, 49,  was reported missing last Saturday by his wife, Louise Salzman. The last time he had been seen was the day before.

'This is a strange case of patricide,' Prosecutor Mark Lindquist told KOMO News. "The motives are still being investigated."

According to police, Rylan killed his father after the two parents had engaged in an argument over the phone. Rylan was at home with Richard who had been drinking.

In a call to 911 that Tuesday, Rylan claimed that the altercation took place when he confronted his father about the argument. Richard became upset, and pushed his son to the ground. That's when Rylan picked up the cane and struck his father repeatedly with it, killing him.

Before admitting to 911 that he had committed the crime, Rylan had told his mother that his father had gone on a bike ride that evening, and had never returned. 

Louise Salzman, who had been staying at a family member's home, filed a missing person's report the next day. By Tuesday, she began getting a search party together. However, her son tried to discourage her from doing so, eventually admitting to the crime and calling 911.

The teenager told his mother that they could find the body at the family's home, although he did not say where. A team later searched the area, finding Richard Salzman in a wooden box which contained a compost heap.

The body was partially covered with dirt, cat litter, a cut-up bicycle, and motor oil.

The Pierce County Medical Examiner’s office said Wednesday that Richard 
Salzman died of blunt force injuries to the head. His death was ruled a 
homicide.

According to the Medical Examiner, he had been beaten so severely that he could only be identified through dental records.

'It's deeply disturbing, obviously,' Teresa Salzman, Richard Salzman's niece, told KIRO7. 'It's just something, I guess, you could never forsee happening.'

According to Teresa Salzman, Richard was a loving, caring man.

'He was essentially a father to me' said Teresa, 'and he loved his family and his children dearly.'

Following Rylan's arraignment, his bail was set at $1 million.
