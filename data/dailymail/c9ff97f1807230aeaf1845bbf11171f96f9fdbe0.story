Apple Inc released a new
software update late on Thursday after some users of its new
iPhone 6 complained of call service disruptions and other
problems due to a previous update.

Fewer than 40,000 iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices were
affected when users downloaded the iOS 8.0.1, Apple spokeswoman
Trudy Muller said. The new update, iOS 8.0.2, fixes the issue.

The company said the iOS 8.0.1 was live for a little over 60
minutes, before it quickly pulled it back to investigate the
issue.

Apple's new phones also face criticism over their
bendability, dubbed 'bendgate.'

Social media and online forums
have been abuzz with comments about how the new phones can bend
when placed in back pockets or while wearing skinny jeans.

The new update also features other improvements such as to
its app store, mail and camera, listed by the company on its
website.

Apples shares closed down almost 4 percent at $97.87 on
Thursday, wiping out nearly $23 billion in market value.

As the giant tech company scrambled to fix a software glitch that left some of its new iPhones unable to make calls, some analysts said Thursday that Apple is doing the right thing by quickly acknowledging and apologizing for the problem - which it was slower to do with earlier iPhone problems.

'There's a certain perception that Apple has to get things right, and when they don't, the whole company gets questioned,' said Carolina Milanesi, chief of research at Kantar Worldpanel. 'But they came out and said "We apologize; we're working 24/7 to fix it." I think that's what matters.' 

'All major companies have released fixes that they've had to pull because of unforeseen side-effects,' veteran tech analyst Ross Rubin of Reticle Research said.

As for the bending issue, Rubin said the iPhone 6 Plus is 'a large, thin device. That's not to say customers should treat it gingerly, but it's still an electronic product and it's an investment, and it should be treated as such.'

Apple is held to a higher standard by many consumers, analysts said. But Milanesi said she thought the company suffered more harm a few years ago, when it was slow to acknowledge complaints about poor reception and dropped calls that affected new iPhone 4 models when they were released in 2010. The company eventually offered a fix for the problem, after then-CEO Steve Jobs initially suggested users just needed to hold the phone differently.

'There wasn't any of that this time,' Milanesi said. She noted that Jobs' successor, CEO Tim Cook, had also taken responsibility and apologized for initial problems with Apple's Maps software when it was first released.

Meanwhile, one analyst said Thursday's stock sell-off was more likely related to broader market concerns than investor unease about the new iPhones.

'Earnings is what drives the stock the most,' said Walter Piecyk of BTIG Research. 'It's too early to say what the impact's going to be, but it does not appear to be something that would impact the company's ability to deliver on earnings' in the next two quarters.
