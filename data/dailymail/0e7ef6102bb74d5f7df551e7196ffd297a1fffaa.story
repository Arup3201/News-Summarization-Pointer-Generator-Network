They're no stranger to topping the best dressed lists but it seems David and Victoria Beckham have amassed more than a few fans of their hair.

Indeed, so popular are the couple's hairdos, they've topped a nationwide poll - and pushed the likes of Peter and Abbey Crouch and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge into second place.

The Beckhams are famous for their ever-changing styles, although Victoria has stayed faithful to her simple current look for more than a year - an unusually long time for the fashion-conscious couple.

Stylish: The Beckhams' current choice of hairstyle sent them shooting to the top of the poll

David, meanwhile, is currently sporting a simple short back and sides - a civilised look that is a far cry from the cornrows and mohicans of years gone by.

Classic styles such as those embraced by the Beckhams proved particularly popular among those polled, with Abbey Clancy's neat waves propelling the Strictly winner and her footballer husband into second place with 18 per cent of the vote.

The huge buns loved by Chloe Sims saw the TOWIE star and her boyfriend Eliot Wright take third spot, while Angelina Jolie, another fan of well-groomed waves, and Brad Pitt came in fourth.

But popular though the stylish manes of Angelina Jolie and Abbey Clancy are, no one came close to the Beckhams who garnered more than a fifth of the total vote.

Looking good: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are both fans of a classic hairstyle and always look  groomed

1. Victoria and David Beckham - 23 per cent

2. Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy - 18 per cent

3. Elliot Wright and Chloe Sims - 17 per cent 

4. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt - 13 per cent

5. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West - 10 per cent

6. Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively - seven per cent

7. Cheryl Cole and Jean Bernard Fernandez Versini - six per cent

8. Beyonce and Jay Z - three per cent

9. Kate Middleton and Prince William - two per cent

10. Marvin and Rochelle Humes - one per cent

'Victoria and David
 Beckham are one of the best groomed couples I know,' explained one respondent to the poll, which was conducted by hair and beauty retailer, Hairtrade.com.

'Victoria has 
definitely taught her man how to look his best, and what a heartthrob 
he’s become. The pair’s hair is impeccable, and we can only hope that the rest of their brood grow up to look just like Posh and Becks.'

Another
 respondent added: 'The celebrity couple with the best hair has to be 
Elliot Wright and Chloe Sims. They always look flawless and their great 
barnets top it off. I just 
hope that they stay a couple for a longer than the average reality TV 
relationship so I can continue to see their great hair. I love watching 
them and getting tips for styling my own.'

But not everyone plumped for a celebrity couple, with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge scraping into the top 10 in ninth place with two per cent of the vote.

'Kate and Wills still have to be top for me even though Will’s hair is disappearing quickly,' revealed a respondent with a penchant for a right royal hairdo.

'Kate
 always looks gorgeous and her hair is no exception. I’m sure she has 
lots of stylists to help her achieve her perfect just blow dried look, 
but I would give anything for my hair to look as full and voluminous as 
hers.'

A spokesperson for 
Hairtrade.com said: 'All of the couples on the list look stylish and 
well groomed, but Victoria and David Beckham do have it down to a tee 
when it comes to looking great.

'Most
 of the celebrity couples have their own stylists to help them achieve 
their look, but it’s easy to get the look yourself at home just by 
knowing what products to use.'
