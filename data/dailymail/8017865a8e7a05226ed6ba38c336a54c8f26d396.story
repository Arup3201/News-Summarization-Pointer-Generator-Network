U.S. prosecutors untangling the aftermath of a $45million global cyber heist have released images of the suspected criminals' impressive  loot, including piles of cash, high-end watches and even a luxury car.

Among the items seized from the seven men arrested in the U.S. Thursday were shopping bags from Gucci, a Porsche Panamera and a dozen fake credit cards.

Meanwhile, German prosecutors said on Friday they had made two more arrests in connection to the case.

A 35-year-old man and a 56-year-old woman, both Dutch citizens, were caught on February 19 withdrawing 170,000 euros ($220,500) in Düsseldorf using Bank of Muscat credit cards. In total, $2.4million dollars was withdrawn in seven German cities, the prosecutors said.

On Thursday, U.S. prosecutors said an international criminal gang had stolen $45million from two Middle Eastern banks by hacking into credit card processing firms and withdrawing money from cash machines in 27 countries.

They allegedly used hacked debit-card data to make 40,500 transactions worldwide.

The ringleaders of the global operation were believed to be outside the United States but U.S. prosecutors have declined to give details, citing the continuing investigation. Germany is the only other country so far to announce arrests.

A spokesman for the Düsseldorf prosecutor's office said the two Dutch people under arrest had come to Düsseldorf with the purpose of withdrawing money in Germany. The two suspects are accused of computer fraud and faking credit cards.

Germany's banking association, BdB, said it was not aware of any banks in Germany suffering losses as a result of the scheme.

In the complaint on Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department accused eight men of withdrawing $2.4million from 3,000 bank cash machines in New York in the space of 10 hours in February. The Department said seven of the men have been arrested.

Authorities said they arrested these seven U.S. citizens and residents of Yonkers, New
York: Jael Mejia Collado, Joan Luis Minier Lara, Evan Jose 
Peña, Jose Familia Reyes, Elvis Rafael Rodriguez, Emir Yasser Yeje and 
Chung Yu-Holguin.

Dominican police on Friday confirmed that the eighth, Alberto Lajud-Pena, allegedly the leader of the New York cell, was killed in the Dominican Republic on April 27.

The 23-year-old suspect was gunned down during an attempted robbery in a house in the city of San Francisco de Macoris about 100 miles northeast of the capital, Santo Domingo, according to police.

Investigators found $100,000 in cash in the house, as well as an M-16 assault rifle, two 9 mm pistols, a revolver, ammunition clips and a telescopic sight. The money and weapons belonged to Lajud-Pena, police said.

Lajud-Pena, known as 'Prime' and 'Albertico,' was shot and killed by a gang of three men, of whom the leader was Carlos Manuel Jiménez, alias ‘La Vaca Loca’ (Mad Cow), according to police in the Dominican Republic. Jiménez and the two men were in custody, police said.

It was not immediately clear if the gang or the $100,000 found at the house were linked to the cyber theft. U.S. prosecutors have said that $2million in cash is still missing from the heists.

A man arrested in his death told authorities it was a botched robbery, and two other suspects were on the lam.

According to court documents, Lajud Pena communicated via email with a Russian criminal organization that specializes in laundering money and wrote to his shadowy bosses in charge of the operation. He wired money and deposited cash into several accounts.

‘I sent scanned deposit slips,’ Lajud Pena writes in one.

‘Deposit has cleared. Order paid. Good job,’ the sender replies.

Prosecutors said Lajud Pena recruited men he knew from Yonkers, some of whom worked as bus drivers for a company that provided services to special-needs students.

Members of the global criminal 
organization hacked into two credit card processors and used stolen data
to make the withdrawals, during two separate coordinated incidents in 
December 2012 and February 2013, the Justice Department said.

The
government charged eight individuals in New York with participating in 
the larger scheme by withdrawing $2.8million in thousands of ATM 
transactions, in what U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said was the 
second-biggest bank robbery in the history of New York City.

Lynch said it was likely that the 
headquarters of the global scheme was located outside the United States 
and that the current charges focused only on the New York-based cell.

Investigators were examining whether other cells were operating elsewhere in the United States, she said.

'In the place of guns and masks, this cyber crime organization used laptops and the Internet.

'Moving
as swiftly as data over the Internet, the organization worked its way 
from the computer systems of international corporations to the streets 
of New York City, with the defendants fanning out across Manhattan to 
steal millions of dollars from hundreds of ATMs in a matter of hours,' 
said Lynch, whose office in Brooklyn, New York, brought the case.

The case demonstrates the major threat that cyber crime poses to banks around the world.

Security experts frequently identify electronic fraud as one of the key challenges facing banks today.

'Hackers only need to find one 
vulnerability to cause millions of dollars of damage,' said Mark Rasch, a
former federal cyber crimes prosecutor, based in Bethesda, Maryland.

In
the December attack, hackers gained access to an Indian credit card 
processor that handled prepaid Mastercard Inc debit cards for National 
Bank of Ras Al Khaimah PSC, or RAKBANK, according to a criminal 
indictment. 

RAKBANK said on Friday the fraud against it took place at the end of last year and resulted in losses of around $4.7 million for the United Arab Emirates-based lender.

Bank CEO Graham Honeybill said he believed the fraud went wider than lenders in the Gulf region. ‘We are given to understand that the overall fraud encompassed a number of banks not only in the Middle East but in the USA and other countries,’ Honeybill said in a statement.

The amount of the potential loss for RAKBANK was 17.4 million UAE dirhams ($4.7million) and this had been fully provided for before it closed its 2012 accounts, Honeybill said.

‘The bank can confirm that none of its customers suffered any financial loss as a result of this fraud,’ he added.

The incident related to events in December 2012 and involved the bank's service provider in India, he said, without naming the provider or giving any further details.

In 
February, the hackers broke into the system of a U.S.-based credit card 
processor to steal account numbers for prepaid Mastercard debit cards 
issued by Bank of Muscat, the indictment said.

The second operation was far larger than the first attack, eventually totaling $40million in losses to Bank of Muscat.

In
late February, Bank Muscat disclosed that it would take an impairment 
charge of up to 15 million rials ($39million) because it had been 
defrauded overseas using 12 prepaid debit cards used for travel.

That charge was equal to more than half of the 25 million rials profit it posted in its first quarter ended March 31.

The indictment does not identify the processor companies.

Bank representatives could not be reached for comment outside of regular business hours.

In
both cases, the hackers boosted the available balance for each card and
eliminated the withdrawal limits, allowing them to take out huge sums 
of money from ATMs in what prosecutors called an 'unlimited operation.'

A
single account number, for instance, yielded nearly $9million in 
profits, including $2.4million in New York City alone, prosecutors 
said.

The hackers 
distributed the account numbers to coordinated 'casher' crews stationed 
across the globe, who siphoned millions of dollars from ATMs within a 
span of hours in December 2012 and February 2013.

One of the New York defendants was caught in surveillance footage from ATMs in Manhattan during the February operation, prosecutors said.   

After the cards were shut down, cashers laundered the proceeds, often by purchasing luxury goods, and sent a portion of the money back to the organization's leaders, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors said they seized hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and bank accounts, as well as two Rolex watches and a Mercedes SUV, from the New York defendants.

No individual bank accounts were compromised by the scheme, Lynch said.

It wasn't immediately known which lawyers were representing the defendants.
