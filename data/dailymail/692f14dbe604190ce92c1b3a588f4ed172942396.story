When the Duchess of Cambridge first burst onto the royal scene courtesy of a catwalk appearance in a risqué sheer dress, few could have predicted that within a decade, hers would become one of the most talked about wardrobes in the world.

Sales of the £780 floor-length Diane von Furstenberg lace gown worn for the Royal Variety Performance last night have gone into orbit, as the American brand becomes the latest beneficiary of what has been dubbed 'the Kate effect'.

But fashion fans aren't the only one left swooning by the Duchess of Cambridge's stellar sense of style. Since her marriage four years ago, an army of Kate clones has appeared, among them her own mother and some of European royalty's heaviest hitters.

Lovely in lace: Queen Letizia and the Duchess of Cambridge regularly opt for black lace, as does Kate's sister Pippa Middleton

Carole, who like her daughter chose a black lace dress for the Royal Variety Performance, has form when it comes to taking her pick from Kate and Pippa's wardrobes.

Days after the Duchess, dressed in a demure blue spotted dress, left hospital with Prince George, her mother was seen wearing an almost identical frock.

But it isn't just Carole - Kate takes style tips from her mother too, and even borrows her clothes. One was a £650 Colette Dinnegan dress, worn by Carole to a wedding in 2009 and by Kate to another in 2011.

Another dress loved - and worn - by both was a simple royal blue draped dress by Reiss that made its debut on Carole at Royal Ascot in 2010 and was worn for the second time by the Duchess in 2012.

While Carole has unfettered access to Kate's wardrobe, the Duchess' elegant style has also proved a hit with her royal contemporaries, among them Sophie Wessex and Princess Beatrice.

Sophie Wessex, who, pre-2011, boasted a wardrobe remarkable only for its normality, has undergone an impressive makeover in recent years, much of it inspired by her niece-in-law.

Like the Duchess, she loves a tailored coat-dress and an elegant hat, which, like Kate, she often buys from up-and-coming milliner, Jane Taylor - who also numbers Princess Beatrice among her clients.

Beatrice, 26, has also revamped her style in recent years, swapping frumpy, ageing dresses and the infamous pretzel hat for a succession of glamorous separates and tailored dresses.

As with the Duchess of Cambridge, she's partial to a spot of lace and has also chosen similar colour combinations to her cousin-by-marriage with royal blue and cream becoming firm favourites.

And it isn't only members of the British royal family who have taken note of the Duchess of Cambridge's elegant look. Others to do so include Queen Letizia of Spain, Crown Princess Mary of Denmark and soon-to-be-royal Sofia Hellqvist, 29, who wore a royal blue dress, strikingly similar to the Issa number worn by Kate, for her engagment photo.

Letizia and Mary, both 42, share the Duchess' love for floor-length lace, tailored shift dresses and nude court shoes, as well as understated 'Hope' earrings by British jewellery brand, Links of London.

Like the Duchess of Cambridge, both come from relatively humble backgrounds with Letizia enjoying a successful career as a journalist before marriage, while Mary worked as a marketing manager for an Australian pub. 

Both have won plaudits for their elegant sense of style in the years since they married and the pair have even been known to dip into each other's wardrobes - on occasion stepping out in identical dresses.

Indeed, so successful are they - and Kate - at picking the perfect ensemble whatever the occasion, other royals have begun to take note, with Stéphanie, Hereditary Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, 30, sporting grey shift dress for her meeting with Letizia last week that had been worn by the Danish princess seven days before.

The Netherlands' Queen Maxima, 43, also favours a tailored style - albeit one enlivened by some seriously eye-catching costume jewels - as does the elegant Queen Mathilde, 41, of Belgium.

But of all the royals in Europe, the Swedish royal family is the one that bears the closest resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge, with both Crown Princess Victoria, 37, and her sister Princess Madeleine, 32, opting for increasingly elegant, tailored ensembles in recent years.

Like the Danish princess, both love a sequin but as with the Duchess of Cambridge and her mother, lace and elegant shades of navy, cream and royal blue reign supreme.
