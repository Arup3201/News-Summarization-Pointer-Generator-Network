Arsenal's youngsters succeeded where the first team failed as they beat Borussia Dortmund in their opening UEFA Youth League group match.

Two first-half goals from Kaylen Hinds secured victory at the Montanhydraulik Stadion on Wednesday lunchtime.

The young Gunners reached the quarter-finals of the continental Under 19 competition last season and made the perfect start towards their aim of advancing further this time round.

Arsenal opened the scoring after 14 minutes when Hinds beat Dortmund goalkeeper Tim Siegmeyer after Daniel Crowley had set him up and the forward doubled the lead just after the half-hour after linking up with Chris Willock.

Hinds is highly rated and featured for the Under 19 side at the age of 15.

Still just 16, the youngster has impressed for England at youth level too.

There was also a start for Gedion Zelalem, who could well be in line for another first team appearance in the Capital One Cup next week.

Arsenal's teens faired exceptionally better than the senior side did on Tuesday night.

In a one sided affair, Dortmund beat Arsene Wenger's team 2-0 in what was the worst possible start to their Champions League campaign in Group D.

Mesut Ozil was once again criticised, while Jack Wilshere turned his ankle late on and is now a doubt for the Premier League game against Aston Villa on Saturday.

Barcelona won the UEFA Youth League last season, a competition which has been praised for bringing young stars through.
