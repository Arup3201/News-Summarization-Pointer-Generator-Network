A mother says her six-year-old daughter is only alive today thanks to the local optician who correctly suspected she had a huge brain tumour.

Chrissy Fletcher had become so concerned about her daughter Darcey's headaches that she took her to the local hospital - where doctors simply diagnosed a migraine.

It was only when the family optician saw her that she became worried she had many of the telltale signs of a brain tumour.

After being rushed back to hospital, doctors discovered Darcey had a  brain tumour the size of an orange - which would have killed her within a week.

Risk: Darcey Fletcher would have been dead within a week had an optician not spotted her brain tumour. Her mother Chrissy is furious that doctors at the local hospital did not scan her to test for the condition

Lucky: It was only during an eye test than an optician Mrs Fletcher a leaflet on brain tumours (left). To her horror, Mrs Fletcher realised Darcey (who is now back at school) had seven of the eight warning signs

Recalling the nightmare situation, Mrs Fletcher said: 'Darcey had been ill for about a week in November last year and we thought it was a virus. 

'I took her to the doctors because it was not going away and they said it could be migraines or a virus. 

'They gave her tablets for migraines. 

'We left it for about five days but she was still waking up screaming in pain. I got the doctor out on the Friday and he said to go to Barnsley Hospital.'

There, after being seen by a student doctor Darcey was referred to a senior colleague.

The doctor carried out a set of tests on the youngster, including those for lack of co-ordination, which is a symptom of having a brain tumour.

However he decided not to give Darcey a scan.

Mrs Fletcher said: 'He gave her a check-up and was banging her knees. 

'She had to walk up and down and do other tests but they still thought it was a virus or something to do with migraines.

'The doctor said "I know what you are going to ask, you are going to ask for a scan, but she doesn't need one".'

Recovery: She also had surgery to have the orange-sized cancerous tumour cut out of her brain

Mrs Fletcher was then told  she should get Darcey's eyes tested and to come back in a month if they still persisted.

Concerned, she took her daughter to the local optician in Skelmanthorpe, West Yorkshire, the next morning. 

'They know us well and they looked at her eyes,' said Mrs Fletcher. 

The optician then gave her a leaflet on brain tumours - and, to her horror, Mrs Fletcher realised Darcey was suffering from seven of the eight warning signs. 

Mrs Fletcher, who has three older children, said: 'The tumour was too low down for them to see it but they gave me a leaflet and Darcey ticked every box apart from epilepsy.'

Terrified, her husband called a family friend, who works as a consultant in Sheffield.

She advised the couple to take Darcey to hospital straight away. 

Within 40 minutes, doctors at Sheffield Children's Hospital had carried out a MRI scan which revealed the orange-sized brain tumour.  

She then underwent emergency surgery to have fluid drained from her brain and later more surgery the tumour removed. 

Scarred: Darcey had to undergo emergency surgery to have fluid drained from her brain 

Doctors at the hospital told Mr and Mrs Fletcher that had the tumour not been found, Darcey would have been dead within a week. 

Her mother said: 'It was absolutely crazy. They said if I hadn't brought her in she would have been dead within a week.

'Our world collapsed when they detected the scan. My husband said to the surgeons: "please tell me you have magic hands". 

Symptoms listed on the pamphlet Mrs Flether was given by the optician:

'Brain Tumours happen. Symptoms include:

*Persistent/recurrent headache

*Persistent/recurrent vomiting

*Balance/coordination/walking problems

*Abnormal eye movements

*Blurred or double vision

*Behaviour change

*Fits or seizures

*Abnormal head position such as wry neck, head tilt or stiff neck

If your child has one of these, see your doctor. 

If they have two or more, ask for an 'urgent referral'.' 

'We just went into overdrive. We were crying but we didn't want to cry in front of Darcey.

'I was so cross when I found out I could have lost her.' 

'Barnsley should have done the scan. 

'When we found out about the tumour it was like I was watching a film. 

'As a mum I know my daughter. I'm not one to take her to the doctors for a cold, it's only when there is something really wrong.

'The surgery was the longest six and a half hours of my life. We were all a right mess.'

Darcey stayed in hospital for 11 days and was able to go home in time for Christmas.

She is now back in school but needs to go back for a scan next month to make sure that the tumour has not spread to her spine.

Mrs Fletcher added: 'I just cannot thank the optician enough.

'It was she who suggested something was seriously wrong after doctors at Barnsley Hospital and thought Darcey may have a virus or possibly migraine.

'I took her a bunch of flowers but it doesn't seem enough.'

The family is now considering legal action.
