Dereck Chisora vowed to cut Tyson Fury down to size as they weighed in ahead of their heavyweight rematch.

The two men exchanged heated words as Fury tipped the scales more than 20lb heavier than his rival, albeit with a tracksuit on.

He then refused to shake Chisora's hand and appeared tetchy as the Londoner said: 'You're 6ft 9in but tomorrow night you'll be 5ft 5in.'

Fury retorted: 'I've beaten you once, now I'm going to knock you out.'

Chisora scaled 241.5lb, his heaviest in four fights but more than a stone lighter than before his first fight with Fury three years ago.

Fury was 264lb but will be in much better shape than the flabby figure who took on Joey Abell in February.

That was just Fury's second fight in almost two years after he saw his domestic dust-up with David Haye twice postponed.

And it is Chisora who has enjoyed the greater fortune since losing to Fury on points in 2011.

His impressive showing against Vitali Klitschko in February 2012 was overshadowed by his shameful brawl with Haye at the post-fight press conference.

The pair settled their differences at Upton Park that summer as Chisora suffered a fourth career defeat.

A heart-to-heart with his mum saw him overhaul his diet and training regime before he strung together five consecutive victories.

The winner on Saturday night will be installed as the mandatory challenger to world champion Wladimir Klitschko.
