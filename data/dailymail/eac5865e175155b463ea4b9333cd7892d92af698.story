The daughter of cosmetics tycoon Ron Perelman is locked in a legal battle with her uncle over millions she says he stole from her.

Samantha Perelman is already rich. Her father is worth an estimated $12 billion. Nonetheless, she is vying with Samantha’s dead mother’s brother for the other side of the family’s millions.

CEO James Cohen of Hudson Media, the company that owns the ubiquitous airport and travel hub newsstands, is poised for war with the Perelmans over an estimated $600 million.

The younger Perelman, a 22-year-old Columbia graduate student, is claiming Cohen coerced her grandfather—his father—out of his millions as he lay dying and cost Perelman her inheritance.

‘At the end of the day, it’s a 55-year-old man who wants to get his way faced by a 22-year-old girl who knows what the intentions of her mother and grandfather would have been,’ Perelman told the New York Daily News. ‘I’ve been completely washed out of the family.’

Or at least one side of it. Perelman is the daughter of former Daily News gossip columnist Claudia Cohen, whose father, Robert Cohen, built Hudson News into a retail empire starting with a Newark, New Jersey news stand.

But as her grandfather lay dying, Samantha Perelman says her uncle James tricked him into rewriting his will three times to exclude her.

Heiresses: Samantha with her late mother, former gossip columnist Claudia Cohen, in 2005. Soon after her mother died in 2007, Samantha claims in a lawsuit that her uncle started cheating her out of her grandfather's newspaper stand fortune

Claudia Cohen died of cancer in 2007 and left her own fortune, around $60 million, to her beloved daughter.

From that moment on, Perelman alleges, James Cohen began to funnel his family’s money away from her.

First she says he swindled her out of millions by using his right to buy her out of her share of her grandfather’s Palm Beach, Florida mansion. So, instead of $11 million, Perelman got the book value of $178,000. 

Whose battle? Ron Perelman with his ex-wife, the late Claudia Cohen. Perelman is himself a billionaire stakeholder in Revlon. Though he's fought with the Cohens over millions before, daughter Samantha says this fight is her own

Perelman also alleges she’s been cheated out of a $25 million bequest, a $5 million trust fund, an Englewood, New Jersey home and was even forced to pay James back a $10 million loan her mother had taken from her grandfather.

Perelman’s father Ron Perelman, whose made billions through leveraged buyouts of companies and his stake in Revlon cosmetics, stepped in the ring when his former brother-in-law chose to buy Samantha out of her share of the Florida mansion.

Since then, a clash of the titans has ensued. Perelman lost the challenge to the Florida home buyout. And in New Jersey, Perleman sued again to get Robert Cohen mentally incompetent, which would have invalidated his will. He lost both.

The elder Perelman, a well-known buyout king, has been in the spotlight himself many times. The 70-year-old has seven other children and has been married five times, including a 2000 to 2006 union to actress Ellen Barkin.

Nonetheless, Samantha maintains this battle is hers and hers alone.

‘There is this misconception that it’s two battling tycoons on each side of the Hudson,’ Samantha told the Daily News.

‘This is my case,’ she said. ‘This is my fight. It has nothing to do with my father. I’m lucky to have a supportive father.’

Samantha says she’s in the litigant’s chair now and has filed suit in New Jersey in an attempt to get her grandfather’s will invalidated and get the millions she says she’s owed.

Meanwhile, Cohen is denying claims he coerced his father into changing his will to his own benefit and suggests Samantha was removed from the will because the late elder Cohen hated her father.

The case goes to trial in September.
