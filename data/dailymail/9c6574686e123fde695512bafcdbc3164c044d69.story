Facebook has unveiled a new tool which lets you demote 'friends' to just being 'acquaintances'.

The tool actually suggests friends who might be ripe for the chop - based on people who you haven't messaged or interacted with for a while.

Once a friend has been 'demoted', you see fewer of their posts in your news feed - but they'll never know of their new, lower status.

The 'acquaintances' list has been around since last year - but the new tool makes it easier to demote friends, by suggesting 'victims' from your Friends list

'Last autumn, we introduced the Close Friends and Acquaintances lists to help you see more posts in news feed from your close friends, and fewer from acquaintances you don’t know as well,' says Facebook engineer Jonathan Coens.'Today we’re announcing a tool to make it easier to add friends to your Acquaintances list.'

The tool works like a negative version of the 'suggested Friends' the site occasionally offers.

When you visit your Acquaintances list (next to your Friends list) a new option pops up - 'See All Suggestions'.

The friends on the list are people who Facebook suggests might belong among your acquaintances instead.

Coens is keen to emphasise that the victims will never know what's happened. 

'When you add friends to your Acquaintances list they won’t be unfriended or notified. You’ll just see fewer of their posts in news feed.
