It is the home of the Bellini cocktail and renowned as one of the twentieth century's most famous bar, serving the likes of Orson Welles, Charlie Chaplin and Ernest Hemingway.

But after surviving the Second World War and years of fascist rule, the legendary Cipriani family have called last orders on Harry's Bar in Venice after 81 years.

In the past three years, the iconic watering hole has struggled with mounting debts of almost £5million.

Last orders: Arrigo Cipriani has lost control of Harry's Bar in Venice, 81 years after it was set up by his father Giuseppe

Global brand: Harry's Bar was opened in 1931 at a converted warehouse and has spawned copycats around the world

Now, the banks have called in Luxembourg's Blue Skye Investment to cut costs and re-organise the bar.

Arrigo
Cipriani, son of Harry's Bar founder Giuseppe, blamed the decline of 
'quality tourism' and the failure of staff to take a pay cut on the 
establishment's difficulties.

The
banks are now insisting on replacing Cipriani with executives chosen by
the investment fund that partners the Cipriani family. The executives 
will handle all future staff negotiations.

More than half of the bar's costs are
spent on the wages of the 75 staff. They went on strike action when 
voluntary redundancy was suggested.

Mr
Cipriani, who started working at the bar aged just 19, told the 
Corriere Della Sera newspaper that in the past five years custom has 
declined by as much as 30 per cent.

The 80-year-old, who said family tradition dictated he become a barman, said: 'These days These days, many day-trippers come to 
Venice, but not quality tourists.

'We cannot deny that we miss the 
Americans who were a guaranteed clientele for the whole year, we are 
feeling that. And that is not compensated by the new wave of rich 
Russians or Chinese.'

It is widely regarded as one of the best champagne cocktails in the world - despite being made using Prosecco. 

Giuseppe Cipriani named the cocktail, made using white peach, after Giovanni Bellini, the fifteenth century Venetian painter in 1948.

When making a Bellini, all the ingredients and the glass needs to be as cold as possible. 

It should be poured one part peach puree to three parts Prosecco and a small amount of sugar should be added to taste.

Harry's Bar website warns drinkers to never make a Bellini out of yellow peaches or peach schnapps.

The 
bar, on the St Mark's bay waterfront, was founded in 1931 by Mr 
Cipriani's father Giuseppe and over the years gained dozens of famous 
patrons, including some of the biggest names of the twentieth century.

Truman Capote, playwright Somerset Maugham and Noel Coward all drank at the bar. 

Ernest Hemingway had his own table 
during his time as a regular from 1949 and set several scenes from his 
novel Across the River and into the Trees in the bar.

Giuseppe Cipriani said once, 
according to The Independent: 'He was generous to a fault and filled 
more pages of his cheque book than those of a medium-length novel'.

In 1948, the classic Bellini cocktail was invented using Prosecco and white peach puree.

According to Jamie Oliver, who counts the Ciprianis among his friends, when Giuseppe first made the cocktail the sun was setting and the colours of the drink matched the view.

It was named Bellini after the painter Giovanni Bellini because the colours also matched a robe worn by one of the paintings subjects.

The
bar was declared a national landmark by the Italian government in 2001.

It has spawned several bars and restaurants around the globe in cities 
including London, New York and Istanbul.

Giuseppe Cipriani may never have had his own bar if he had not met a 'sad' young American Harry Pickering.

And even if he had somehow got the money, it certainly would have been called something else.

While working as a barman at Hotel Europa in Venice, Cipriani struck up a friendship with Pickering, a student who was staying in Europe with his aunt.

After she left him alone in a foreign country with no money, Cipriani offered to lend his new friend, who he called 'such a fine young man', 10,000 lira.

Two years later, after he had given up hope of seeing the money again Pickering walked in and said thanks for the money and gave him 40,000 lira so he could open his own bar.

Cipriani recalled his friend saying: 'I think they'll call it Harry's Bar. Not a bad name.'

He rented a nearby warehouse for rope and transformed it into one of the most chic bars in town.

The first and only guest book bore the signatures of Chaplin, Coward, Maugham, and Barbara Hutton.

Cipriani once said: 'I opened Harry's Bar on May 13, 1931. If all the clients who now say they were among the first to walk through the doors that day actually did, the bar would have had to have been as large as Saint Mark's Square.'

As well as the world famous Bellini, Cipriani is also credited with inventing carpaccio as it is known today.

The raw meat dish was originally only conceived as a starter but Cipriani prepared the dish for the countess Amalia Nani Mocenigo when he learned she was told to eat raw meat by doctors.

It was his second classic inspired by his love of art. Carpaccio was named after the Venetian painter Vittore Carpaccio, who was known for his use of red and white tones.
