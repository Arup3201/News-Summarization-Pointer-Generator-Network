An injured grandmother lay drifting in and out of consciousness on a freezing motorway fast lane for nearly an hour waiting to be taken to hospital following an horrific car crash.

Jan Arbabi, 53, was pulled from the wreckage by her husband Ramin after the couple's Peugeot 207 span into the central reservation, flipped over and rolled on the M60 in Greater Manchester.

But Mr Arbabi was unable to drag his stricken wife from the fast lane.

Other drivers stopped and switched their hazard lights on to protect the scene and gave Jan first aid. Though an ambulance was called at 9.54pm and arrived 15 minutes later, paramedics didn't have a spinal board to move Mrs Arbabi and it was only when a second ambulance arrived at 10.45pm that she could be taken to hospital.

Mrs Arbabi said: 'It was very cold and very, very frightening.

'Why we had to wait so long for the ambulance I don’t know, I’m not happy about having to wait like that.

'I want to know what went wrong as I don’t want anyone else to go through that. The accident was a horrible experience, I just remember it seeming silent apart from the sound of me screaming.

'We were so lucky to escape.'

The grandmother of five was a passenger in the couple's car when a fox ran out across the anti-clockwise carriageway close to the Bredbury junction.

Mr Arbabi swerved in a bid to avoid the animal but the car went into a spin.

His wife said: 'It was like something out of a Stephen King film, from the start when the fox ran out to being left lying in the fast lane.'

Jan and Ramin, 58, had been visiting friends in Chester, Cheshire, when the accident happened on December 13.

It was only by chance that the second ambulance with the spinal boards turned up at all. It was flagged down while en route to another accident nearby on the opposite carriageway where a mother and daughter had been cut from the wreckage of a Renault Clio with serious injuries.

Fifteen minutes later, another ambulance arrived to take Mrs Arbabi to hospital.

Fortunately both she and her husband escaped with cuts and bruises and were discharged the following day.

A spokesman for the North West Ambulance Service said: 'We are sorry that the patient feels that they did not receive a timely response from us.

'We received the call to attend the road traffic accident at 9.54pm.

'An ambulance arrived at the scene at 10.09pm and commenced treating the patients involved. Following an assessment of one of the patients, a second ambulance was requested which arrived on scene at 10.45pm.

'We would be happy to discuss the incident in more detail if they wish to make contact with us.'
