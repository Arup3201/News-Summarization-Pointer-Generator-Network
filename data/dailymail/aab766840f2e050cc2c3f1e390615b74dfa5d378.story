Just months after receiving a pair of carbon fibre legs, nine-year-old Jessy Hatch has completed her first long-distance run.

Blighted by a tragic genetic condition - caused by her biological mother's addiction to meth- she was born with badly formed limbs and aged 11 months underwent a double amputation.

For years she learned to walk using prosthetic legs but at the end of last year she moved on to carbon fibre blades, similar to those used by high profile South African athlete Oscar Pistorious, so she could participate in sporting events.

And after a few months of training and the support of her adoptive parents.Jessy from Phoenix, Arizona, tackled her first mini marathon.

Although she had already been playing sports, the running blades will allow her to compete in track activities.

All of the money raised from the mile sponsored run will go to help others like her.

Her foster mother Dawn said: 'Jessy is brilliant. She has a strong will and she’s resilient and smart.'

As a baby Jessy was adopted by Dawn and Aaron Hatch who already looked after 23 other children.

Many of the other foster children also had disabilities caused by drug addicted parents so the couple were prepared for the type of care Jessy would require.

Because her legs were so badly formed at 11-months-old doctors amputated both of her legs above the knee.

At the end of 2011, nine-year-old Jessy received her first pair of carbon fibre legs

Incredibly, after only a couple months of training, in January Jessy decided to participate in a one-mile fun run

A succession of prosthetic limbs allowed her to learn how
to walk as she grew older.

At the end of 2011, aged nine she received her first pair of carbon fibre blades, which made it 
possible for her to run for the first time. 

Incredibly, after only a couple 
months of training at a local gym, Jessy decided to participate in a one-mile Kids Rock run in Tempe, Arizona this January.

Dawn added: 'A double amputee exerts 250 per cent more energy when walking than we do.

'It took us nine years to get her healthy enough to wear these running legs. A little three or four- year-old can’t take in the 2100 calories needed to walk on artificial legs. 

'So Jessy had to have a feeding tube inserted into her stomach to help beef her up. We just took it out in June 2011. After that she could have her running legs as she’d built up enough muscle mass.'

Jessy’s contact with her biological 
family is almost non-existent - she has never met her mother, but has visited her brother twice.

Away from the running track Jessy helps to run a charity called ‘Jessy for Jeans’, which collects unwanted jeans and other clothing for disadvantaged children.
