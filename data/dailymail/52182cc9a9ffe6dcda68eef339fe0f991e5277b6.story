When he was just 19 years old, doctors told Martin Jones he would never see his 30th birthday.

The 32-stone teenager - who regularly downed over 20 pints of bitter in the pub over an evening - had just broken a pair of weighing scales.

Doctors told him he would be eligible for gastric band surgery and a tummy tuck on the NHS, but the Stoke-On-Trent biscuit factory worker, now 22, determined to lose the weight without anyone's help, and declined the offer.

Half the man I was: Martin Jones, who shed 16 stone, poses with the 24 pints of bitter he used to drink every night

He spent the next three years working industriously to shed the weight, immediately cutting out takeaways and alcohol from his diet, then taking up weight training.

But rather than miss out when his friends went to the pub, the previously morbidly obese teenager decided to swap the 24 pints of bitter he used to drink each night with just one solitary glass of orange squash.

Mr Jones said: 'I used to go out drinking with my mates every weekend - the most I 
ever drank was 24 pints in one night, but I’d come close to that every 
time I went out.

'And after a big night out, I’d always have a kebab before I went home, and never thought anything of it. I work in a biscuit factory, moving around custard creams on the forklift trucks, so temptation was constantly in front of me.

'I
have no idea how much I actually weighed in at - the scales I had at 
home went up to 32 stone, but when I stood on them, they just read "error".'

Now you see me, now you don't: Martin Jones aged 19 before losing the weight, left, and now, aged 22 and 16 stone lighter, right

Martin managed to lose 16 stone - over half his body weight - all on his own.

But he is now devastated because the NHS is allegedly refusing to pay for the removal of the layers of unsightly excess skin that the lost weight has left behind on his body.

Martin said: 'I was really upset when I found out the NHS would 
have paid for me to have gastric surgery, but because I’ve done that on 
my own, they now won’t help me.

'I've looked into funding the operation privately, but it’s more than £10,000 - which is way more than I can afford.

'I thought once I lost weight my confidence would improve - but it's had the opposite effect.'

A spokesman for NHS North Staffordshire said: 'We can not comment on individual cases because of patient confidentiality.

'However,
we can say that NHS North Staffordshire does not routinely fund 
abdominoplasty surgery. Where requests are received, the PCT will 
consider these on an exceptional basis.'
