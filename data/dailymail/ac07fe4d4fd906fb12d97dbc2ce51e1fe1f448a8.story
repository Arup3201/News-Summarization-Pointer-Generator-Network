This is the first glimpse of a £475million car production line hailed as the next step in Britain's manufacturing industry.

The vast tangle of metal at Ford's plant in Dagenham, east London - whose history is so famous it was turned into a film - will produce 350,000 low-carbon diesel engines a year when the conveyers start rolling in November.

Made by hundreds of workers and creating 300 new jobs, the two-litre engines will be shipped off to showrooms around Britain as well as countries across the world.

Once the production line is running the plant, which produced 790,000 diesel engines in 2013 and exported 85 per cent of them, will hope to produce 1million units a year.

The move was announced in October after the government's Regional Growth Fund provided £8.9million of the cost.

Opened in 1931, the Dagenham plant employs around 3,000 people and was made famous in 1968 when its female machinists walked out of their jobs making seats, furious that they earned less for their jobs than men.

The 187 women, who brought Ford to its knees and were a key milestone in the equal pay battle, had their experiences made into the 2010 Bafta-nominated film Made in Dagenham starring Sally Hawkins and Rosamund Pike.
