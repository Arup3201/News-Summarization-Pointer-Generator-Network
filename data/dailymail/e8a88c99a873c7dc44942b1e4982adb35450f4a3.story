A police officer who defeated cancer twice has compiled an alternative 'bucket list' in the hope it will inspire others to beat the disease.

Greig Trout, a former crime scene investigator with the Metropolitan Police, decided he would to travel the world and follow his dreams after being given the all-clear a second time.

His list of '101 things to do when you survive' is a take on the 21st century phenomenon of the bucket list - a fantasy wishlist of things to do and see, set up for those battling terminal illness before they 'kick the bucket'.

Survivor: Police officer and cancer survivor Greig Trout has compiled an alternative 'bucket list' to help inspire others to beat the disease

Mr Trout is one of the survivors behind Cancer Research UK's Every Moment Counts campaign which highlights the special moments of those who have encountered the disease.

He was first diagnosed with cancer aged seven and had to have a kidney removed.

Since beating cancer again, the 34-year-old, originally from Dumfries in Scotland, has spent three months working with a remote community in Nicaragua, climbed a volcano in Costa Rica and went nature-watching on the Galapagos Islands. He is currently in Ecuador.

Mr Trout, who lived in Newcastle and Bristol before moving to London to join the police, said: 'After my bowel operation and with chemotherapy looming, the worst-case scenario was death.Â 

Living the dream: Since beating cancer again, the 34-year-old has spent three months working with a remote community in Nicaragua, climbed a volcano in Costa Rica and went nature-watching on the Galapagos Islands

'At that point, my thoughts were not 
of all I had achieved at work as a crime scene examiner or the nice 
apartment I lived in, they were of the places I had visited and of the 
experiences I had had. I also thought of the places I hadn't seen yet 
and may never get a chance to.

'When
 I got my two-year "all clear", I decided the time was right to follow 
my dreams and travel the world with the aim of inspiring others affected
 by cancer.'

The idea for the anti-bucket list came to him when he was in a hospital waiting room.

'It's
 exactly that "every moment counts" feeling,' he said. 'As I watched 
people come and go, I knew some of them were not going to get good news.

'I
 thought how wonderful it would be if they could come on my trip with me
 and the idea of "101 things to do when you survive" was born.

'Most books and travel journals 
concentrate on bucket lists and "things to do before you die". I thought
 it was about time to inspire others to show them what is waiting for 
them when they survive.'

Mr 
Trout has since created a website for his challenge which so far has 50 
ideas on the list, leaving a further 51 vacancies for other suggestions.

He
 said: 'I knew I wanted to create a website showing a double cancer 
survivor who has one kidney, a missing piece of bowel and deep vein 
thrombosis, living a full and happy life.'

Mr Trout's ideas have also caught the eye of adventurer Bear Grylls, who said he had been inspired by the mission.

He
 said: 'Greig is truly one brave man and is determined to shine a light 
and help and inspire those who have faced real battles. I admire his 
courage and resolve so much.'
