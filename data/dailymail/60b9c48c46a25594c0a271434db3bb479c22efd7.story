A community has been rocked after a 10-year-old girl was found dead in a field just yards from her grandparents home in Maryland. 

Kami Ring, 10, was staying in Port Deposit, when she disappeared from her bedroom in the middle of the night.

Her grandparents reported her missing early Monday morning and, after a seven-hour search, her body was found in a field near a shed just 60 yards in front of their home.

The little girl from Charlestown - who according to ABC2 was away from home on a week-long school vacation - was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mystery surrounds what happened to her on Sunday night.

Another relative of the little girl's grandmother was also staying in the house.

The family members say she was last seen around 10pm when she went to bed.

According to WBAL a window screen of the bedroom where she was staying had been pushed out.

The next morning around 11 am, family members called the police and said she was missing.

'They went to check on her and she was missing,' Maryland State Police Sgt. Bill McFarland told Cecil Daily.

Police set up a command center with the Cecil County Department of Emergency Services at the nearby Pleasant View Baptist Church and conducted an exhaustive search of the area near the home, Cecil Daily reported. State Troopers, Maryland Police search dogs and Chesapeake Search and Rescue were involved in the investigation.

'He is out of the picture,' McFarland said.

ABC2 reported she had two siblings but they weren't staying at the property.

Her stepfather Rick Dean, told the broadcaster: 'Kami's a model 10-year-old. She was staying somewhere she felt safe.'

Tributes flooded in for the Charlestown Elementary School student on various social networking sites and members of the local community expressed their sadness and shock at the discovery of her body.

A candlelight vigil was due to be held for her in the town on Tuesday night.
