This is the astonishing moment that a motorcyclist knocked over a pedestrian live on TV last night.

The passer-by was knocked over outside London St Pancras International train station just after 6.30pm  while ITV News reporter Ria Chatterjee was talking about delays on the Eurostar.

Dramatic footage showed her reporting from the roadside as the pedestrian was hit as he tried to cross the street with a suitcase, prompting shocked passers-by to rush to his aid behind her back.

Chatterjee, 32, of Twickenham, south-west London, said on Twitter minutes after the crash: 'The pedestrian and motorcyclist who collided during my live broadcast at St Pancras Stn are both fine.'

And ITV vision mixer Nick Merritt, 31, tweeted: 'Great. Love directing live TV where pedestrians get hit by mopeds in the back of shot. Quite a shock to see. No injuries though - very lucky.'

Meanwhile ITV News head of press Laura Brander tweeted: 'Thankfully both motorcyclist and pedestrian are both fine, according to our reporter.'

The journalist was reporting on the Eurostar problems this weekend, after delays and cancellations struck for a second successive day and passengers complained of long waits to rebook seats.

Thousands of passengers were left stranded by a lorry fire on a train in the Channel Tunnel on Saturday and then a power supply problem this morning saw 11 trains cancelled on the service.

Channel 5 presenter Julian Druker said on Twitter: 'Awful moment just then on ITV News as motorcyclist appeared to collide with a pedestrian outside St Pancras Station, live on air.'

And Ella Smith, of Norwich, tweeted: 'Anyone else see a guy on a moped crash into a pedestrian live on ITV News? Reporter didn't even flinch.'

In addition, Jack Taylor, of Thetford, Norfolk, added: 'Can't believe while me and Jade were watching ITV news earlier some geezer got mowed down by a moped.'

'Very lucky': ITV vision mixer Nick Merritt, 31, tweeted that the incident was 'quite a shock to see'

Chatterjee, who is originally from Porthcawl, south Wales, studied at Royal Holloway in London and Cardiff University, and started her TV career as a broadcast assistant at BBC Wales News in 2005.

She has also worked as a producer for Bloomberg News, a journalist for Sky News, a reporter for BBC South East Today, and as a reporter for ITV's London Tonight and ITV News since  2011.

The Mail on Sunday reported in May of last year how Chatterjee’s partner Rags Martel, who has an 11-year-old daughter Roxie from a previous relationship, had recovered from thyroid cancer.

Martel, who also works for ITV News, was welcomed back to a Chelsea FC press conference by manager Jose Mourinho, who halted one of his pre-match briefings to ask him: 'All good?'
