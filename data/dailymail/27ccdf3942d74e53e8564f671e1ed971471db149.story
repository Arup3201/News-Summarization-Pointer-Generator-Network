As many as 25 African delegates who were in Melbourne for the 20th International AIDS Conference are in crisis accommodation after refusing to leave Australia.

The five-day conference finished on July 25 and delegates from countries including Tanzania are now seeking asylum in Australia, while their visas have reportedly expired or are due to imminently.

One of the delegates, who preferred to remain anonymous, said his work with people with HIV and albinos in his native Tanzania had put his life at risk after, reported the ABC.

Tanzania has one of the highest rates of albino murders in the world, often a result of witchcraft killings.Â 

Receiving death threats, the delegate said he was nearly killed by a group of people who chased him as he drove home from watching soccer game.

'So I got a very bad accident ... almost like dying. They wanted to kill me. After that crash, they disappeared completely because so many people came to give me help,' he said.

Believing the Tanzanian Government will not be able to protect his safety or similar incidents from happening, the delegate plans to lodge his asylum application later this month.

Pamela Curr of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre confirmed the group of delegates was seeking advice about gaining refugee protection in Australia

He said he decided to seek asylum in Australia due to its human rights 'reputation'.

A spokesperson of Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said the government would asses each claim for protection based on individual merit and in compliance with the law.

Pamela Curr of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said the group of delegates was getting advice about gaining refugee protection in Australia, because they come from countries where AIDS-related work had put their lives at risk.

'It seems that some of them have been considering whether they think they can survive in their countries of origin, or whether they should try to survive by getting refugee protection in Australia,' she said.

She said the delegates' visas had either already expired or were due to and that it was not the first time conference delegates have tried to gain refugee status in Australia.

'When people have come from countries where their daily lives are threatened by violence and politics, and they come to Australia and take a deep breath, walk down the street, and know that no one is going to kill them. It's a very intoxicating freedom,' she said.

Ms Curr said this is not the first time conference delegates had tried to get asylum in Australia

Ms Curr said this is not the first time conference delegates had tried to get asylum in Australia and that in the past, delegates had been granted asylum because their claims were considered strong under refugee protection.

Calling a refugee visa one of the 'hardest' to get in Australia, she said the current delegate's claims would be assessed as per the refugee convention.

If found to have a claim, Ms Carr said she wants to see protection offered to the delegates by the government.

Crisis accommodation service HomeGround CEO Heather Holst said the organisation had helped find shelter for 14 of the delegates after they sought help.

She said while the organisation was not involved in the asylum seeking process, they could provide support with finding a place to stay.
