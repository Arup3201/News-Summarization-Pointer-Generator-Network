Malky Mackay - the former Cardiff manager under investigation by The FA for ‘racist, sexist and homophobic messages’ - attended Kick It Out’s 20th anniversary dinner only three months ago.

At a glittering event at Wembley Stadium, Mackay was one of 650 luminaries from the worlds of football, politics and business in attendance.

It is understood that Mackay was sat on a table with former Labour Party leader and Cardiff City supporter Neil Kinnock.

Attendance: Malky Mackay was present at Kick It Out's 20th anniversary dinner only three months ago

Reported: Mackay is being investigated by The FA

On that evening, Martin Luther King III, the eldest son of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. took to the stage to address the audience.

King said at the dinner: ‘People must stand up against racism. We know what we should do, we know what we must do, but we just have to identify the will - when ability and will meet then results occur.’

Mackay has often spoken positively of the anti-discrimination organisation.

Matt Lawton's story that shook football

In 2012, he said: ‘The chairman [Lord Herman Ouseley] of the ‘Kick It Out’ campaign has been championing kicking racism out of our sport for years and is trying his damnedest to make this work, as have a lot of people.

‘People have got opinions but to stand as one block and try and fight against it is the best way.’

Following an educational workshop for local children in 2011, the then Cardiff manager Mackay was quoted as saying: ‘As a Football Club we unite as one against racism.

‘Football is a game followed by all and should an enjoyable experience, whatever their racial or ethnic background. We all have a role in stopping racism in sport, and society in general.’

The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC.

In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete.

The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise.

Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC.

Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter.

Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others.

Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.
