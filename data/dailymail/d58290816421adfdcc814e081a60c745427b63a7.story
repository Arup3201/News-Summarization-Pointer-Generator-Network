Gwyneth Paltrow, 42, has joined forces with chef Amanda Chantal Bacon to share some recipes they say make them 'glow from within' and some of the ingredients are rather bizarre 

One such drink is called 'GP’s brain activating adaptogenic drink', which is packed with spring water, almond butter, vanilla mushroom protein, maca powder and a curious sounding 'brain dust' that Amanda created herself. 

The medicinal food educator claims that her potion, which is made up of superfood such as astragalus, gingko, lion's mane (a mushroom) and stevia, 'lights up your brain and increases mental flow by feeding neurotransmitters and brain tissue'.

Describing the concoction, Amanda writes: 'Designed especially for GP, who was complaining of brain fog and too many amnesiac moments, this drink is packed with powders and nutrients that will leave you feeling energized, calm, and clear-headed. 

'Brain dust increases mental flow, maca delivers abundant energy, mental stamina, and an elevated mood, and the vanilla mushroom protein relieves stress while nourishing the heart and spirit.'

The recipes featured include mysterious powders such as spirit dust, left, and brain dust, right, which apparently boost energy, stamina and mood

Another intriguing recipe in the post is 'sex bark'. 'This quick and potent chocolate recipe is perfect for a sweet bite after a romantic dinner,' claims Amanda.

It's full of Ho shou wu, which is apparently a herb tonic used for centuries to enhance youthfulness, reproductive function, and sex drive.

Spirit truffles, meanwhile, are described in the post as  the 'most intense (and healthiest!) chocolate truffles we’ve ever eaten'. 

The key ingredient is spirit dust, a mixture of reishi, pearl, cinnamon, and goji. Describing the sweet treats, Amanda writes: 'The spirit dust feeds harmony and extrasensory perception through pineal gland de-calcification and activation, while the hemp seeds feed the brain, nourish the eyes, stimulate blood cells, and beautify hair and skin.'

As well as sharing some downright bizarre recipes, Gwyneth uses her blog to impart her parenting advice. This week's installment? Calming apps for kids. 

'There are no shortage of apps out there that make kids really hyper,' writes the mother-of-two.

'And any parent knows how hard it is to pry an iPad out of a kid’s hands when it’s time for bed. So we rounded up some end-of-day options that are a good compromise: Whether they play relaxing sounds, or teach simple-to-follow meditation techniques, they can lull just about any amped-up kid to sleep.'

She includes apps such as smiling mind, which apparently helps them tackle everyday stresses, sleep meditations for kids and my first yoga - an app to boost focus and quieten the mind. 

This week in Tinseltown, Gwyneth  made sure that all eyes were on her  in a blue gown at the Los Angeles premiere of her new film Mortdecai.

The 42-year-old star  turned heads as she showed off her  figure at the gala held at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood on Wednesday night.
