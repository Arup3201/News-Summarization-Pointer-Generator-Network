Wearing their traditional costumes as they solemnly perform their rendition of the Nativity story, this 'Mary and Joseph' would not be out of place at any Christmas play.

But look a little closer and you'll see that underneath Mary's headdress is a crash helmet, with Joseph also sporting the safety gear.

Schoolgirl Libby Dorman, eight, and her brother Reuben, five, were made to wear the helmets in case they fell off their donkeys as they rode through the streets of Neath, South Wales as part of an outdoor performance.

Safety first: Health and safety measures meant 'Mary', aka Elizabeth Dorman, 7, and 'Joseph', played by her brother Reuben, 5, had to wear crash helmets when taking part in a nativity play in Neath, South Wales

Organisers at The Bridge Church in Neath, took the extra measures in response to health and safety fears.

Youth worker Mark Barrett, 44, said: 'We were advised that any young child riding a horse or donkey needs a hard hat for health and safety purposes.

'We had to consider that Mary was going to be riding a donkey on a public highway.

'I know that the donkey was not moving very quickly but we didn't want to flout the law.

Easy riders: The donkey's owner told nativity organisers that he could lose his licence if the children did not wear helmets

'The owner of the donkey told us that because of his licence Mary needed to wear a riding hat.'

Christmas shoppers cheered on the young actors playing Mary and Jospeh as they rode through the town centre behind an organiser in a high vis safety jacket.

Little Libby managed to hide her hardhat under a shawl as she made her way to the Christmas nativity play but Reuben couldn't disguise his riding hat.

The young actors then knocked on doors in the town square to see if there was 'any room at the inn'.

Little stars: Around 25 children between the ages of eight and 16 took part in the open-air nativity play and raised money for the Philippines disaster fund as part of the One Big Christmas Appeal

Mr Barrett said another health and safety rule meant they had to make sure Mary and Joseph didn't weigh more than eight stone.

He said: 'It has been a wonderful event designed to bring the community together and we're thrilled to have been involved in something which celebrates the true meaning of Christmas.'
