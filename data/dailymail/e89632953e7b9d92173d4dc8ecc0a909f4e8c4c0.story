Tamara Ecclestone’s ex-fiance is facing jail today after he was found guilty of attempting to blackmail the socialite out of £200,000 by threatening to reveal her ‘intimate secrets’.

Derek Rose, 33, emailed the wealthy star’s agent, Dana Malmstrom, warning her he would sell sordid stories about their sex life to the tabloid press if she did not pay.

Rose dated 28-year-old Miss Ecclestone, the daughter of Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone, when she was 17, and was briefly engaged to her until he discovered she had cheated on him.

He sobbed as he was convicted unanimously of blackmail by a jury at Southwark Crown Court after four hours of deliberation.

Guilty: Derek Rose (left outside court today) went out with Miss Ecclestone (right) when she was 17 and tried to use sensitive information to blackmail her

Dressed in a smart grey suit, Rose cried and held his head in his hands after the jury delivered the verdict.

In an email the heiress was asked to pay a £200,000 ‘non-release’ agreement within five days, which claimed falsely that a tabloid had given them a deadline to accept a lucrative deal.

Victim: Miss Ecclestone arrives at Southwark Crown Court last week for the trial of the two men accused of blackmailing her

Miss Ecclestone’s agent Miss Malmstrom replied in November 2011 saying they would not be pursuing their offer at that time but ‘thank you for getting in touch.’

The duo were arrested after Miss Ecclestone called police when Rose out of the blue tweeted her 19 days later saying: “Hi stranger, long time. What’s up?”

Miss Ecclestone confronted her blackmailers in court last week and said Rose was her only boyfriend to ever go to the press about her.

Giving evidence from the witness box she said she first heard of the plot from The Sun journalist Alex West at a charity event at Great Ormond Street Hospital in November 2011.

She told the court: 'I asked if it was Johnny Ketterman and he replied "yes, but don’t worry, The Sun wasn’t going to run any story".

'I thought it was him partly because Johnny had sold a story on me previously and I’ve never had a boyfriend sell a story on me before, and because of the physical description that Alex West described to me and what his character was like.'

The message was timed to coincide with the second episode of a three-part series on Miss Ecclestone aired on TV.

Target: Tamara Ecclestone was told to pay the £200,000 or face 'intimate details' being revealed in the national press

Defendant: Prosecutors claimed Rose was the 'driving force' behind the plot and planned to keep £150,000 if they were successful

When police raided Rose's home in 
Camden, north London, they found a box marked 'Tamara' which had a 
letter he had once sent to Mr Ecclestone along with holiday photos and 
press cuttings about his former flame.

On trial: Jakir Uddin has been accused of helping an ex-fiance of socialite Tamara Ecclestone blackmail her for £200,000 by claiming he would sell his story to a newspaper

Asked why he kept them, he said: 
'That’s my mum. Every time Tamara’s in the papers or on the news she 
feels the need to bring them round.

'I kept them so I had a story. If I ever showed it back to my grandkids I can say I used to go out with Tamara Ecclestone.'

Rose,
whose name was Jonathan Ketterman at the time he dated Miss Ecclestone,
also sold a 'kiss-and-tell' story to the Mail on Sunday to get back at 
her for cheating on him, the court heard.

He said: 'But the journalists weren’t interested in Tamara, they were interested in Bernie.

'They
were very clever and asked me questions about Bernie as well as Tamara,
about Bernie getting beat up in a car once when we went to the cinema. 
In fact the story ended up being about Bernie rather than Tamara.

'It made me look stupid and I’ve regretted it ever since. Obviously the £10,000 I got was nothing.'

Precise details of the story Rose planned to sell were not revealed 
during the trial, though jurors saw the full content of the e-mail sent 
to Ms Malmstrom.

Sun reporter Alex West and photographer Louis Wood were approached at a 
hotel in London on November 13 with a video of Rose talking about Miss 
Ecclestone.

Rose, who has a 13-year-old son and changed his name from Jonathan 
Ketterman to Derek Rose in August 2011, sold a lurid story about Miss 
Ecclestone’s private life to the Mail on Sunday for £10,000, printed on 
August 21, 2002, the court heard.

He said he had been left ‘heartbroken, upset and destroyed’ after he discovered she had cheated on him.

Guilty; The jury at Southwark Crown Court agreed today that Derek Rose has tried to blackmail MissEcclestone by threatening to sell 'intimate secrets' about their sex life

Jurors are continuing to consider a verdict on Coventry University media
studies student Jakir Uddin, 20, who is accused of helping Rose carry 
out the plan.

'Dana Malmstrom, My name is Jakir Uddin and I’m the official representative of Jonathan Ketterman, the former fiance of Tamara Ecclestone.

'As you can imagine since Tamara Ecclestone’s show was aired my client has been inundated with offers from a lot of major tabloids, plus TV and radio.

'Whilst my client has not talked about Tamara in 10 years and has left her to live her life while he has lived his on Monday this week one of the UK’s biggest tabloids with a life-changing offer of £200,000 to go ahead with the story and disclose all.'

Rose added: 'When we broke up I was quite bitter and I wanted to get back at her for breaking my heart at the time'.

When interviewed by police he told how he faxed a letter to the socialite and her billionaire father after she dumped him in 2002.

Rose said: 'I think I might have got a bit racial at one stage about the guy I believe she was cheating on me with so I faxed it to Bernie and to her, but I never heard anything back.'

Prosecutors claim Jakir Uddin, 20, sent an email to Miss Ecclestone’s then manager Dana Malmstrom in November 2011 pretending to be co-defendant Derek Rose’s official representative.

In it he claimed a tabloid newspaper had offered Rose, 33, who went out with Miss Ecclestone, 28, when she was 17, £200,000 for details of their relationship. But no newspaper had made such an offer.

Giving evidence Uddin told jurors he had looked up to Rose, who was more than 12 years his senior.

Uddin said Rose had helped with the lifestyle magazine he had set up with a friend while studying at Coventry University.

The older man had introduced him to celebrities and given him advice drawn from his own experience in working in the media industry, Uddin told the court.

'I regarded him as someone with a high status in the media,' he said.

Uddin told jurors he had filmed Rose talking about his relationship with the eldest daughter of Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone for a university project.

But Uddin said that when it was rejected by his tutor, Rose suggested to him that they offered it to the newspapers.

'I saw it as a sort of favour for Mr Rose,' he said.

Both men blame each other over the scheme.
