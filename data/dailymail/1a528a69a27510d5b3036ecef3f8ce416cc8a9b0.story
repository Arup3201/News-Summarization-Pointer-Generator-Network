Gordon Strachan praised the courage of his Scotland side after they came close to matching world champions Germany in their own backyard.

For four minutes the Scots dared to believe after Ikechi Anya's superb solo goal cancelled out Thomas Muller's first half opener.

Sloppy defending allowed Muller to add a second – his 25th for his country – in the 70th minute.

But the Germans ended the 2-1 win in Dortmund's Signal Iduna Arena clinging to three Euro 2016 qualifying points – despite a bizarre red card to Charlie Mulgrew for time wasting when the Scots were desperately chasing an equaliser.

'The Germans are always going to have more of the ball, and more chances,' said Strachan, 'that goes without saying. At 1-1 I genuinely believed we could win the game. I saw the players playing with no fear.

'The first 20 minutes, it wasn't fear. We just asked the players to look out for passes, but they rushed these passes and we lost the ball quite a lot. That gave the Germans easy possession.

'So we had to adjust after 20 minutes and then we settled down a bit. In the second half we played with no fear and, as I say, at 1-1 I genuinely believed we were going to win the game.'

The Scots succumbed to a preventable winner from Muller despite crafting a raft of second half chances against a much changed Germany side.

Declining to criticise the quality of the defending Strachan added: 'If you can find me someone who is 6ft 4in and can head the ball for miles and jump about 8ft like Muller can then it's avoidable.

'But we don't have anybody like that and I think most countries in the world are the same. When you are delaing with an exceptional machine like Muller then you'll have a problem. That's always going to be the difference.'

Goalkeeper David Marshall kept the Scots in the game during a backs to the wall first half before the team improved significantly in the second, substitute Steven Fletcher making a big impact by sending Anya in for his cool finish.

Picked over Allan McGregor and Craig Gordon Strachan said of Marshall: 'I think if you look at our substitutes and how well they played you can see I can big decisions all over the place.

'Everybody has their strengths so you pick a team with the strengths to play the team you're playing.

'I could actually have picked another team and it would have given us the same performance. That is how good our squad is getting.

'But I did the easy bit, I just had to sit there and tick things off on my sheet and write notes. The players should be proud of how they played.

'I think in the first 20 minutes we could have done things better as a group.

'But once we got that sort out we had no fear of the game, which I thought was great. And the longer the game went on the more a threat we became.

'So the players really should be proud of their performance.

'All we have to do is work on how we play in the first 20 minutes and when we get that sorted out we'll be fine, we'll be good.'

The only sour note came after Scotland players thronged Norwegian referee Svein Oddvar Moen over a series of dubious decisions in the closing stages.

The official sent off Charlie Mulgrew for a second bookable offence for time wasting when the Scots were chasing an equaliser. Scotland also believed they should have had a penalty for handball and were angered the final whistle went as they won a corner.

Winner: Scotland's joy was short-lived as Thomas Muller scored the winner just four minutes later

'I went onto the pitch to make sure my coaching staff didn't overstep the mark and to congratulate the lads,' said Strachan, restraining himself afterwards. 'I think we try our best not to speak about referees but I would love to see the referee's assessment of that performance. That's all I've got to say about it.

'I'd like to see the referee's assessment of the game. Unfortunately we don't get to see them though.'

Ultimately Scotland were undone by a world class finisher, with Muller – and the Scots – earning praise from Joachim Low afterwards.

'Nothing Thomas Muller does astonishes me. He is always clinical in front of goal and is always there when you need him. That's what he does.

'Scotland hasn't lost for a year now and won two times against Croatia and in Poland so we knew they would be a very difficult opponent.

'We did make a few mistakes at the back and they capitalised on that but I always believed we had it in us to score a second goal and in the end we did.'
