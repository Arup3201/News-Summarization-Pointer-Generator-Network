The Delhi government has approved a proposal to open a 'semi-open jail' at Tihar.

Seen as an effort to reintegrate and rehabilitate the inmates, the concept will allow them to step out of their cells to work and earn wages fixed by the government.

Those sentenced to between five and 10 years and with a good track record in the prison will be eligible under this proposal.

There's a catch, though. The prisoners can't venture beyond the 400-acre Tihar complex. They will be employed in PWD, horticulture and other contract projects on the sprawling jail premises itself.

Convicts with pending court cases against them or involved in prison violence such as assault, jailbreak and riots won't be considered in this scheme, as won't be inmates involved in robbery, terror, sedition, kidnapping and smuggling.

A committee under the chairmanship of the DIG (deputy inspector general) (prisons) R.N. Sharma will select the convicts for the semi-open jail. In an annual review on Tuesday, the prison authorities detailed their 'achievements' in 2011 and revealed further plans to make the functioning of the jails smooth and friendly.

More than 73 per cent of Tihar inmates are undergoing trial, above the national average of 66.4 per cent.

Out of the 11,598 prisoners lodged in Tihar, 8,911 inmates are undertrials, including 410 women.

In an initiative against smuggling of drugs and prohibited articles inside the jail, Tiharauthorities will also procure fullbody scanners.

These scanners will detect metals stored inside body cavities.

'We also have sniffer dogs to search for drugs which cannot be detected by the scanners,' said Neeraj Kumar, director general (prisons).

The authorities have also introduced smart cash cards to assist prisoners in various transactions in jail canteens, by replacing the old coupon system.

The last year was eventful in the history of Delhi jails because many high-profile inmates were lodged in them, especially Tihar, which added to the safety and security challenges.

Emphasising that the authorities never discriminated between high-profile and common inmates, Kumar said: 'Equality before law prevailed even in jail'.

To ensure a corruption-free mechanism in Delhi jails, 32 prison officials were suspended and disciplinary action taken against 67 officials last year.

At least 18 officials were found guilty, out of which 11 were handed out major punishments. 'We try to make the system cleaner and more transparent,' Kumar said.
