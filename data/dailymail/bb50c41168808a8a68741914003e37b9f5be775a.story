The BBC has been left red-faced after Lord Sugar praised contestants on The Apprentice for coming up with a new energy drink called Big Dawg... which already exists.

On last week’s episode of the hit show, contestant James Hill dreamt up the name for an energy drink to be marketed in America.

But a simple Google search of the name and ‘energy drink’ brings up a review of the beverage, including a picture and its ingredients.

The disclosure is particularly embarrassing for the hit show – which is meant to find a business partner for Lord Sugar – as it raises potential trademark issues and appears to highlight a lack of proper checks by production staff.

During last week’s episode, the two teams were asked to come up with and market a new energy drink.

The task, which saw three of each of the show’s teams travel to New York to pitch to experts, was won by Team Summit, with Hill, 27, singled out for his efforts.

Lord Sugar said: ‘The brand name was good . . . This brand is American, there’s no question of it.’

But analysis by this newspaper shows a review for a drink called Big Dawg has been online for at least two years and says that the drink is sold for $1.99 in North Carolina.

Last night, a spokeswoman for The Apprentice admitted production staff were aware of the other Big Dawg drink but checked there was no UK trademark, adding the contestants did not know it existed because they were not allowed to use the internet.
