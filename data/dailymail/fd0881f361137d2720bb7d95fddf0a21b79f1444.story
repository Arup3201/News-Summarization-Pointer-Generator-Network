Britain's use of intelligence hoovered up and stored by US mass surveillance programmes to spy on citizens was illegal, a tribunal has ruled.

The Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) said the information-sharing regime between GCHQ and America's National Security Agency was a breach of human rights.

The UK's eavesdropping service used vast amounts of personal information supplied by US spy chiefs, including websites visited, emails sent and received, text messages, calls and passwords.

The IPT, the only judicial body with the power to investigate MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, ruled the listening post had acted unlawfully when it used intercepted communications provided by top-secret US surveillance programmes called Prism and Upstream.

However, after Britain's use of the controversial programmes were admitted by the Government in December last year, they immediately became legal.

That means GCHQ is now free to carry on using data harvested by the US.

Citizens who thinks their communications were intercepted by GCHQ prior to December can complain to the IPT and potentially have any records deleted.

It is the first time the tribunal has ruled against an intelligence agency in its 15-year history.

The judges said that before December it was illegal for intelligence chiefs to use information swept up by the programmes because the public were unaware of the safeguards in place.

But when additional details about the bulk surveillance programme – just two paragraphs – were disclosed, this was sufficient to make the practice compliant with the European Court of Human Rights.

Downing Street said that Prime Minister David Cameron believes the Government should make sure that the intelligence agencies 'continue to have the powers they need to keep us safe'

Human rights groups Liberty, Privacy International and Amnesty launched the legal challenge against GCHQ following leaks by US fugitive Edward Snowden.

He became one of the world's most wanted men after breaking cover as the civilian CIA worker who stole countless classified files from the US National Security Agency which exposed spy tactics used to track terror suspects.

The human rights campaigners claimed that GCHQ's methods breached the right to privacy and protections on freedom of expression.

They disagreed that the intelligence-sharing was lawful and vowed to challenge the tribunal's decision at the European Court of Human Rights.

Liberty legal director James Welch said: 'We now know that, by keeping the public in the dark about their secret dealings with the National Security Agency, GCHQ acted unlawfully and violated our rights.

'The intelligence services retain a largely unfettered power to rifle through millions of people's private communications. The tribunal believes the limited safeguards revealed during last year's legal proceedings are an adequate protection of our privacy. We disagree.

Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, said: 'We must not allow agencies to continue justifying mass surveillance programs using secret interpretations of secret laws.'

A GCHQ spokesman said: 'The IPT has found against the Government in one small respect in relation to the historic intelligence-sharing legal regime.

'The ruling re-affirms that the processes and safeguards within the intelligence-sharing regime were fully adequate at all times - it is simply about the amount of detail about those processes and safeguards that needed to be in the public domain.'

Downing Street  said the judgment did not require GCHQ to change its operations.

A spokesman said that Prime Minister David Cameron believes the Government should make sure that the intelligence agencies 'continue to have the powers they need to keep us safe'. 

'The overall judgment this morning is that the UK's interception regime is fully lawful. That follows on from the court's clear rejection of accusations of mass surveillance in their December judgment, and we welcome that,' the spokesman said.

'It's important to be clear that the overall interception regime and bulk interception they found fully, fully lawful, and that it was compliant with the right to privacy at all times.

'What they said was, on the legal framework governing that, that there should be more about the rules that should be disclosed publicly. I think it was two paragraphs of additional detail, and the Government did that during the proceedings.

'They are not questioning in this judgment that the safeguarding of privacy was in any way jeopardised and the judgment will not require GCHQ to change what it does.'
