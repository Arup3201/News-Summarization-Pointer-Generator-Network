Michelle Obama and her daughters were joined by the President's half-sister Auma on Tuesday as  the group made a sombre tour of the Holocaust memorial in Berlin.

The First Lady, Malia, 14, and Sasha, 12, bowed their heads and listened carefully to the words of a tour guide. Michelle looked lost in thought as she wandered through the vast site while Malia appeared deeply moved and reached out to touch the stones.

The Obamas are in Germany for a two-day visit and while the President meets with leader Angela Merkel, his wife and daughters visited the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, a solemn reminder of the millions of lives lost during the Holocaust.

The memorial consists of 2,711 concrete 
slabs on four acres of land in the heart of Berlin, and is visited by 
hundreds of thousands of people every year.

Mrs Obama and her daughters were joined on the trip by Auma, the president's half-sister, who studied in Germany and lives in Kenya.

Mrs Obama and her daughters had dressed in lightweight clothes to combat the blistering hot day in Germany.

The First Lady wore a monochrome, sleeveless top over black trousers with a double strand of pearls and sunglasses.

Malia was dressed in cropped camel trousers with matching pumps and a pale blue T-shirt while younger sister Sasha wore a darker blue T-shirt and patterned jeans. Auma Obama was dressed in a black shift top and trousers.

Auma Obama was born in 1960 and is a year older than her President half-brother.

She is the daughter of the President's father Barack Obama Senior and his first wife Kezia. 

In 1959, Barack Obama Senior, left Africa to take up a scholarship at the University of Hawaii. Auma appears to have been conceived when his father was home on holiday in Kenya.

In America, Barack Sr met and married Ann Dunham, an anthropologist from Kansas. But soon after she gave birth to the future president of the United states, he left and returned to Kenya.

Auma Obama studied German at the University of Heidelberg from 1981 to 1987 before completing her PhD at the University of Bayreuth in 1996. 

She married an Englishman Ian Manners in 1996 and lived in London although the couple are now divorced.

She is now a development worker in Kenya. 

At one point during the tour, Malia reached out to touch one of the stone monuments as her younger sister looked on.

The group were given a guided tour by 
Uwe Neumaerker, director of the foundation for the Memorial to the 
Murdered Jews of Europe.

Opened in 2005 near the Brandenburg Gate, the field of 2,700 concrete slabs of varying height evokes a cemetery to many visitors and serves as a memorial for the millions of Jewish victims of the Holocaust.

Visitors walk along pathways that descend into the heart of a claustrophobic maze. The fate of the millions who were murdered is documented in a subterranean information center below the paths.

When
 they arrived at the memorial, surrounded by Secret Service officials, 
Michelle hugged her youngest daughter as they climbed out of an SUV.

Later at Checkpoint Charlie -- the 
well-known border crossing between Berlin's former U.S. and Soviet 
sectors - the Obama family viewed a temporary display by artist Yadegar 
Asisi which gives visitors a glimpse at what life along the Wall was 
like.

A large panorama inside a circular 
building gives a photorealistic view of a divided 1980s Berlin 
neighbourhood, showing the graffiti-covered West side of the Wall and, 
beyond the guard dogs, barbed wire and search lights, the drabness of 
East Berlin beyond.

The Obama family was set to be joined
 by Joachim Sauer, the husband of Chancellor Angela Merkel, on the next 
stop, the Berlin Wall Memorial, a remaining 720ft section of the 95mile 
'death strip' that split the city between 1961 and 1989.

Significant: Michelle Obama's motorcade passes Checkpoint Charlie, the former Berlin Wall crossing point between the former GDR and West Berlin, in Berlin

Located at Bernauer Strasse, it features a preserved guard tower and fortifications of the Wall, where at least 136 East Germans died in the city during escape attempts.

The final stop was set to be the Reichstag, which housed the assemblies of the German Empire, Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany until it was destroyed by fire in 1933, leaving it abandoned for decades.

Refurbished after Germany's 1990 reunification by architect Norman Foster, who added its characteristic glass dome to symbolize open democracy, it has since 1999 housed the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag.

After their tour, Mrs Obama and her daughters would relax for the afternoon, Berlin newspapers reported.

Michelle, Sasha and Malia were due to go shopping near their luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz before the girls go to a movie in a nearby cineplex.

President Obama is visiting Berlin 
for the first time during his presidency and his speech at the 
Brandenburg Gate is to be the highlight this evening.

Obama will be speaking close to the 
50th anniversary of the historic speech by then U.S. President John F. 
Kennedy in Berlin in 1963, during which he proclaimed the famous 
sentence: 'Ich bin ein Berliner.'

Next stop: Obama step off Air Force One last night with his family

Purpose:  Obama will walk in John F. Kennedy's footsteps this week on his first visit to Berlin as U.S. President, but encounter a more powerful and skeptical Germany in talks on trade and secret surveillance practices

The Obama party flew in from Ireland 
on Monday night. Earlier that afternoon, Michelle and her daughters had 
lunch with Bono in the quaint coastal village of 
Dalkey.

The singer took his distinguished 
American guests to favorite pub Finnegans where the menu featured local 
seafood, rack of lamb and traditional Irish fare like corned beef and 
cabbage.

The Obamas started on Tuesday with an 
hour-long visit to picturesque Glendalough in the Wicklow Mountains - 
but the two girls looked like they would have rather slept in at their 
luxury hotel.

On Monday, the Obama women appeared to be having a great time as they giggled and pulled a series of wacky faces during a performance of Riverdance.

Malia and Sasha had looked less than enthralled earlier that day as they toured the Medieval Book of Kells with their mother at Trinity College in the capital.
