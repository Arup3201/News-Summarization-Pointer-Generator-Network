Discredited vocational qualifications that teach basic career planning and even how to claim benefits will today be downgraded to push more students into traditional subjects.

So-called ‘personal effectiveness’ courses will be removed from the list of approved qualifications by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan.

She said it was ‘unimaginable’ they had been deemed equivalent to an AS-level in subjects such as physics or maths.

Schools and colleges have been encouraged to enter children for easy exams to boost their own performance rankings, leaving youngsters ill-equipped for the workplace.

Mrs Morgan told the Mail it was ‘frankly ridiculous’ that personal effectiveness still existed as a stand alone qualification.

She added: ‘I’ll strip out every poor-quality course to ensure [children] have access to the highest standard of qualifications.’

Personal effectiveness courses cover topics such as citizenship and work-related learning.

Courses previously excluded from league tables include:

One included material telling students how to ‘find out what benefits you are entitled to if you are unemployed’ or how to ‘obtain information’ by ‘using the telephone’.

Last year, qualifications in ‘UV Tanning’ and ‘Mentoring and Befriending’ were removed from the approved list.

A report by education expert Professor Alison Wolf found that up to a third of the non-academic courses introduced under Labour and taken by 400,000 16 to 19 year-olds were ‘pointless’.

Since the Coalition came to power in 2010, the proportion of pupils studying core academic subjects at GCSE has gone up by 60 per cent.

Teenagers have been urged to aim higher in their degree course applications after top universities dropped their entry requirements.

The chances of a B-grade applicant winning a place at an elite institution have doubled as universities battle to ensure their places are filled after tuition fees rose to £9,000 a year. 

Mary Curnock Cook of admissions service UCAS said ‘potential students could afford to be more ambitious’.
