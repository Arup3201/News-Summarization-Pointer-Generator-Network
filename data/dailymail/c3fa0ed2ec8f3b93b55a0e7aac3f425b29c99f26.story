Inventors have come up with a novel solution to avoid waking up a partner in the night when turning on a bedside lamp - by hiding it under the bed. 

The discreet light aims to solve the age-old problem, as it comes on automatically under the bed as you climb out for any reason - such as checking on a crying child.

Its smart motion sensor detects both light and movement and guides you to the bathroom or anywhere else you might be heading.

New York-based e3light has devised a 'smart' £49.99 ($75) bed light. Called mylight, it uses motion detectors and is placed under a bed. When someone steps on the ground, the light turns on (shown)

The motion sensor, which only operates in the dark, can attached to a bed leg and looks out for movement laterally.

Meanwhile, the user fits strips of LED lights on the bed frame underneath the mattress.

The kits, called mylight and made by New York-based e3light, are being sold through John Lewis stores - with one priced at £49.99 ($75) and two for £64.95 ($98).

The company are even in talks with hotel chains and cruise liners to use in their hotel rooms and cabins, as well as healthcare suppliers.

Snuggling up with a good book in bed has long been seen as a way to wind down at the end of the day.

But scientists have discovered that the millions who read their bedtime stories on an iPad or a Kindle Fire are actually keeping themselves awake.

They found that people who regularly read electronic books before lights out sleep for fewer hours.

They had reduced levels of melatonin, a hormone which plays a role in inducing sleepiness. 

The study was carried out by Penn State and Harvard universities in the US and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. 

Kasper Daugaard, 36, global sales manager for e3light, said: 'So many people are waking up their partners every night when going to the bathroom.

'With mylight a subtle light turns on at floor level and you are guided to your bathroom or wherever you are headed.

'This is also why cruise lines and hotels like it - there's no need to fumble for light you don't know where anything is in the dark.

'People with dementia have gained from this product as the light automatically comes on and there is no need to begin or remember where the light switch is.

'People think its a great and original idea.

'At first it seems like a "like to have" product and not a "need to have", but once its installed we see clients coming back to purchase more for their children's rooms.

'People are now also installing it in their closets as we now also have a product called Closet light that does this.'

The product can also be helpful for children who get out of bed in the middle of the night, providing them with light so they can find their way to the door
