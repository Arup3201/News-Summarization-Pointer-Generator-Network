The original 1960s Star Trek TV series is widely credited as reflecting the progressive attitudes of that decade, but a recently unearthed writers' guide has revealed the program wasn't above a bit of casual sexism too as it went in search of all important ratings.

The 31-page writers’ guide for the original series offers up a fascinating insight into how early episodes of the iconic series were crafted.

The guide, written in 1967, was written to explain creator Gene Roddenberry's vision to TV writers working on prospective scripts for the show, which was then entering its second season.

Writers were advised to think of Kirk as 'a space-age Horatio Hornblower, constantly on trial with himself, a strong, complex personality'

The guide features revealing insights about the show's key characters and back story to help writers nail the tone and content of a typical episode, reveals Slate.com.

For the show's main character Captain Kirk (William Shatner) writers were advised to think of him as ‘a space-age Horatio Hornblower, constantly on trial with himself, a strong, complex personality.’

In a section entitled 'The Crew' writers are told to remember that the crew of the USS Enterprise are 'international in origin, completely multiracial.'

The show has been rightly recognized for how progressive it was in representing people of all colors.

Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) was the first African-American woman to hold such an important role in an American television series and when she locked lips with Kirk in one episode it was the first interracial kiss broadcast on network TV.

But despite the show's best intentions, some casual sexism was never too far from the screen.

Prospective writer were told to always include a 'yeoman' character to be 'played by a succession of young actresses, always lovely.'

'One such character has been well established in the first year, "YEOMAN JANICE RAND", played by the lovely Grace Lee Whitney. Whether Yeoman Rand or a new character provided by the writer, this female Yeoman serves Kirk as his combination Executive Secretary-Valet-Military Aide,' says the guide.

The Yeoman also got to carry a Tricorder, a device which was described as 'the size of a small handbag.'

The guide also includes hilarious details such as reminding writers that the crew’s uniforms don’t have pockets, 'when equipment is needed, it is attached to special belts.'

Writer are also encouraged to avoid creating planets that might require our heros to don space suits, 'we generally restricted out missions to "Class M" planets (approximating Earth conditions).'

The notes also reveal how creator Gene Roddenberry was keen to avoid the pitfalls of other space-related shows up to that point by being as fast-paced and action-packed as possible.

Low ratings meant Star Trek was canceled in 1969 but TV repeats created a cult classic which has gone on to spawn a major franchise including 12 movies

Writers were reminded to 'build your episode on an action-adventure frame-work. We must reach out, hold and entertain a mass audience of some 20,000,000 people or we simply won't say on the air.'

In the end low ratings did for the series and it was cancelled after three seasons and 79 episodes in 1969. Thanks to repeated episodes throughout the 70s and 80s, the show famously became a cult classic.

It eventually spawned a franchise, consisting of five additional television series, 12 theatrical films, and numerous books, games, and other products leading up to the second film in the J.J. Abrams reboot 'Star Trek Into Darkness', which hits cinemas this week.
