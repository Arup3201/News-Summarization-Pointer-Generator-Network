Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani called on black communities to do more to prevent crime in their own neighbourhoods

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has sparked fresh outrage by suggesting black communities need to do more to stop crime in their own neighborhoods.

Giuliani said there was 'no question' unjustified shootings happen more often in black neighborhoods, but called on those communities to do more to curb violence so police were not called there in the first place. 

He was speaking after being shown a video of an officer in Cleveland killing 12-year-old Tamir Rice as he was holding an Airsoft pellet gun.

Giuliani told Fox News Sunday said: 'There's no question that individual cases have situations that are unjustified, but you've got to put it in proper context.

'Why is it happening? Why is it happening more often in the black community? And doesn't it actually logically make sense that it's going to happen more often in the community where there is five, six, seven, eight, nine times more violence than in another community?' 

The comments were shared widely across social media, though users didn't appear particularly surprised by Giuliani's stance, which has remained largely the same since the fatal shooting of Ferguson teenager Michael Wilson on August 9.  

The Daily Edge tweeted: 'If a policeman shoots you for no reason, you've only got yourself to blame, says Rudy Giuliani'.

Another user said the former mayor 'double downs on blaming black community for police problems'.

Last week Giuliani caused a stir by suggesting more white officers were needed in certain neighborhoods to keep black people from killing one another. He did, however, admit there was 'more unfair interaction' between police officers and people in black communities.

In his most recent interview Giuliani said responsibility for ending unnecessary shootings, rested with both police and the wider community.

While the police force needed to be more diverse and better train their staff, 'just as much, if not more, responsibility is on the black community to reduce the reason why the police officers' were assigned to black neighborhoods.

Giuliani went on to say he had changed his mind about the need for body cameras because he believes they would show that 90 or 95 per cent of police shootings are justified.

Police officer Darren Wilson was not indicted but resigned following the shooting of  Brown 

The comments come as the police officer responsible shooting Brown resigned.

Darren Wilson, who had been on administrative leave since the August 9 shooting, said that he didn't want to put the lives of his colleagues at risk.

Ferguson has been a hotbed of riots and protests since Brown's death and in the lead-up to the Grand Jury decision not to charge Wilson. 

Giuliani had earlier spoken out about the case saying that prosecutors should never have tried to  indict Wilson in front of a grand jury, something he said was simply political theatre.

The remarks later led to accusations during a TV interview that Giuliani was a white supremacist. 

He refused to 'dignify' the question with an answer but went on to say he 'probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York than any mayor in the history of this city'.
