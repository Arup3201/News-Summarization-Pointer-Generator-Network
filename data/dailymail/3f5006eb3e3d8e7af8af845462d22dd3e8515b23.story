Crystal Palace have entered the race to sign Norwich striker Gary Hooper.

Hooper is open to leaving Carrow Road ahead of Monday's transfer window in an attempt to continue playing in the Premier League.

Queens Park Rangers and West Ham also have a firm interest in the former Celtic striker, but the arrival of Neil Warnock has seen Palace throw their name into the hat.

Warnock has been an admirer of Hooper since his days at Scunthorpe and feels the 26-year-old can add real firepower to his Eagles squad.

Goal: Norwich signed Hooper for £5 million from Scottish Premiership champions Celtic

Signings: Warnock will look to add some firepower to his Eagles squad before the window shuts

Hooper signed for the Canaries at the start of last season after a goal-laden three years at Celtic which put him on the cusp of an England call-up.

Norwich paid £5million for him, and the Championship club are keen to recoup as much of their money back in selling Hooper.
