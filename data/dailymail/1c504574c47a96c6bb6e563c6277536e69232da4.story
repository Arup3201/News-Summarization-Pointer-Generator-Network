It was a familiar feeling when David Strettle found himself being towered over by the 6ft 6in Per Mertesacker at Arsenal’s London Colney training ground.

The Saracens winger, who was on the books of Manchester City as a teenager, had to give up his ambition of becoming a professional footballer because he was ‘too small’ to make the grade.

Ironically, the dream of playing at Wembley transpired through rugby, but an afternoon with Mertesacker, Olivier Giroud and Wojciech Szczesny provided a taste of what might have been.

‘They all dwarfed us, but gone are the days where you have people like Julian Dicks and Vinnie Jones running around in midfield,’ said Strettle at a sponsors’ cross-code challenge day.

‘I was always a better footballer at school — Andrei Kanchelskis was my idol — but I wasn’t big enough to make it with City. That’s when rugby took over at about 16.

‘It’s funny how both games have changed. Now you’ve got your Iniestas and your Messis: small guys who are so skilful.’

Strettle draws comparisons between the northern and southern hemisphere games, highlighting the superior skillset of forwards in New Zealand and Australia. Their lighter emphasis on the breakdown, he says, forces the big men to stand out in the backline and become more clinical in attack.

The record-breaking final weekend of the RBS 6 Nations bucked the trend and, having seen England beat France in a 90-point thriller, Strettle feels more needs to be done to spice up the competition.

‘You need to bring in the bonus point to discourage that conservativeness,’ he said.

Strettle, who faces his former housemate Danny Care of Harlequins at Wembley on Saturday, topped the Aviva Premiership try count last season, while this campaign he is ahead of all of England’s Six Nations wingers.

Yet it is approaching two years since he played the last of his 14 Tests and he has learned not to wait by the phone on the day of Stuart Lancaster’s squad announcements.

Jack Nowell and Anthony Watson ended the Six Nations as England’s first-choice widemen, but Strettle, 31, has been surprised at the amount of chopping and changing — with Jonny May and Semesa Rokoduguni both drifting in and out.

‘There’s a situation where someone gets dropped after one bad game,’ said Strettle. ‘Then another player comes in and then it’s back to the start again.

‘It’s the coach’s prerogative but this close to the World Cup I can’t get my head around the fact someone is starting one week and not in the squad a couple of weeks later.

‘I’ve learned not to hold my breath about getting picked. My performances show I warrant consideration, but you just have to do your best and then it’s out of your hands. So long as I’ve got the respect of my peers and team-mates, I’m happy.'
