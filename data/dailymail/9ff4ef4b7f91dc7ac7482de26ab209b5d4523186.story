Had he spoken aloud, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey could be forgiven for speaking before thinking, but when it comes to the written word mistakes are harder to excuse.

Morey was asked over Twitter earlier this week about whether having a job in basketball made him sick of watching it. 

It was all part of a question and answer session, but he has since admitted his response was 'tasteless'. 

Mad Dash: Rockets General Manager equated his job to that of a gynecologist

The exchange: Rockets general manager Daryl Morey said that a tweet that he sent on Wednesday using a gynecologist joke was 'in bad taste'

'No, it is like being a gynecologist, you don't get sick of it', he tweeted. 

During an interview on Friday he addressed the backlash to his witless comment. 

'I had a tweet that was in bad taste,' Morey said. 'I'm going to leave the comedy to the professionals. I think I'm going to stick with my GM job.'

Until now, the Rockets GM was one of the few in the league who are active on Twitter at times.

He may well be considering the sense in such a decision now. 

Sticking by his works? Although he has admitted the joke was in 'bad taste',  Morey has yet to delete the tweet

Morey did not comment when asked if he had been admonished in any way by the NBA for his joke.

Brett Pollakoff from NBC Sports said it appeared that although Morey did not offer an apology, he seemed to realize that it was a stupid thing to say. 

'I believed it was an unprofessional remark for someone at his level to make while acting as a representative of the organization, and also felt it was a comment that needlessly reinforced a negative stereotype of the existence of an overly-macho culture in men's pro sports,' Pollakoff said.
