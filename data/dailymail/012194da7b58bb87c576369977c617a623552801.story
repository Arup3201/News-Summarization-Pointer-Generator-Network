Matt Lauer stole the show dressed as Baywatch's Pamela Anderson this morning - ensuring that the Today show came out on top as the networks battled for the best Halloween costumes.

His hilarious costume - complete with her iconic red swimsuit and flowing blonde mane - came in stark contrast to George Stephanopoulos' full astronaut gear from 'Gravity' on Good Morning America.

While GMA opted for an awards-style show with the hosts dressed as celebrities, Today chose TV characters from classic 80s shows, including the Flinstones and The A-Team.

The energetic performances come as the Today show struggles to knock GMA off the top ratings spot - but this morning's efforts proved they were the real winners, ratings or not.

In the spirit: Today show host Matt Lauer dressed up as C.J. Parker, who was played by Pamela Anderson in Baywatch, as he took part in the NBC morning show's Halloween special on Thursday

Hilarious: As well as trying to recreate Anderson's famous curves, Lauer wore a face full of makeup

Among the hilarious incarnations on 
Today were Willie Geist as a hairy-chested David Hasselhoff, Al Roker as
 Mr T and Savannah Guthrie and Natalie Morales as Laverne & Shirley.

But most eye-catching was Matt Lauer,
 who appeared as the voluptuous Baywatch character with a face full of 
make-up, the skimpy swimsuit and an attempt at recreating the TV star's 
famous curves.

In a 
stunning entrance as the crowd whooped with joy, he burst through a 
screen and ran onto the set in slow motion - in a nod to the classic TV 
show's opening credits.

'It's distractingly strange,' Carson Daly said, adding of his chest: 'They're so alarmingly real on you.'

Fellow
 NBC host Willie Geist took on the role of a bare-chested David 
Hasselhoff character and they were joined by former Baywatch star Carmen
 Electra, who was on the show between 1997 and 1998.

Looking good! Lauer, right, was in high spirits as he joined former Baywatch star Carmen Electra and host Willie Geist in the iconic red swimsuits. The theme of the hosts' costumes was classic TV

Eye-catching: Fellow host Carson Daly called Lauer's chest 'strangely distracting' on the Today show

Different approach: Morning TV's leading men 
took a very different approach to Halloween costumes, with Today's Lauer baring all as Pamela Anderson while GMA's George Stephanopoulos 
was fully covered

In close second came Al Roker, who had donned some busy facial hair, gold chains and camouflage to depict Mr T.

After he jumped from an SUV outside 
the studio, he was closely followed by Savannah Guthrie and Natalie 
Morales as classic TV duo Laverne and Shirley.

Carson Daly then raced onto the set on the back of a 
motorcycle driven by former CHiPs star, Erik Estrada, with both men in 
their smartest California Highway Patrol costumes.

Daly, who had planned to ride in on his own bike until learning that it didn't work, had donned a blond wig and shades to recreate Larry Wilcox's role.

Then
 Kathie Lee and Hoda swept in on a massive Flinstones car as Wilma 
Flinstone and Betty Rubble, complete with massive pearls, hair bows and 
grins.

Uncanny: Al Roker donned a wig, heavy chains and camo to recreate Mr T on the Halloween special

In the spirit: Natalie Morales (front) and Savannah Guthrie were sitcom characters, Laverne & Shirley

Having a laugh: Hosts Kathie Lee and Hoda grinned as they appeared as Wilma Flinstone and Betty Rubble

TV classic: Host Carson Daly and former actor Eric Estrada ride a vintage motorcycle through Rockefeller Center in New York City while dressed as CHIPs for the Halloween show

Celebration: Daly sported a blond wig and shades to recreate the Larry Wilcox character

Working it: Daly and Estrada, who starred in the original series, pose after jumping off the motorcycle

Cheers: The other hosts were tickled as they watched their colleagues appear in ridiculous costumes

What a show: The Today show hosts laugh as Geist reveals his impressively thick chest hair (right)

'Hey Wilma, you know what? It's"Thirsty Thursday", you know what that means?' Hoda, as Betty, asked her co-host.

'Brontosaurus burger and a pterodactyl tequila,' Kathie Lee responded.

NBC news anchor Lester Holt had presented each of the characters in a classic TV round up.

It's not the fist time Matt Lauer has
 dressed as a woman on the Halloween special; in years past, he's also 
dressed as Paris Hilton and Jennifer Lopez in her famous cut-away green 
dress.

It was the first chance in two years that the hosts had to prove their Halloween creativity.

The hilarity comes in stark contrast 
with last year's Halloween, when the morning hosts instead mourned the 
devastation wrought by Hurricane Sandy, presenting segments from across 
the city.

Having a ball: Over on Good Morning America, host Lara Spencer dressed as Miley Cyrus for her entrance

In character: Spencer, 44, recreated Miley's pose from the VMA performance while on a wrecking ball

Fans of the show also put in an impressive performance, swarming outside the studios wearing ghoulish masks and brightly-colored wigs and slathered with facepaint.Â 

Among the costumes were a Scrabble 
board - with children's faces peeking out from behind tiles - and a 
woman in a large wooden frame posing as the character on a Playbill 
magazine.

Over on Good Morning America, the 
theme was celebrity as the hosts and correspondents staged a 'Buzzy 
Awards' for movies and their stars.

After
 winning for the movie 'Gravity', George Stephanopoulus floated out on 
stage wearing an astronaut's costume to depict the character played by 
George Clooney.

And in one outlandish segment, host 
Lara Spencer wore Miley Cyrus' bear swimsuit and swung in on a wrecking 
ball - her tongue poking out like the pop star's.

Famous faces: ABC News correspondent Paula Faris, left, dressed as Kim Kardashian while Ron Claiborne was Kayne. Right, host Sam Champion dressed as Game Of Thrones' Joffrey Baratheon

Snapping selfies: The correspondents stayed in character during the 'red carpet' appearance

Staying traditional: Josh Elliot dressed as President Lincoln in a nod to the Daniel Day Lewis movie

Power couple: He also portrayed Ron Burgundy from Anchorman with Sam Champion as Veronica Corningstone

Another 'award' went to the Game of Thrones' Joffrey Baratheon, played by a regally-attired Sam Champion.

Fellow
 hosts Josh Elliot and Robin Roberts also dressed up as award-winning 
stars - with Elliot as President Lincoln, in a nod to the Daniel Day 
Lewis role, and Roberts as Oprah's character, Gloria Gaines, in The 
Butler.

Ahead
 of the main award show, there were also red carpet appearance from a string of 
celebrities, including ABC News correspondent Paula Faris as Kim 
Kardashian and Ron Claiborne as Kanye West; they posed for selfies 
before posting the pictures online.

The hosts join 
some of the year's best costumes - from a California dad who dressed his
 baby in a home-made LED light costume to make her look like a stick 
figure, to numerous incarnations of Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke's 
performance, including Hugh Hefner and Paris Hilton.
