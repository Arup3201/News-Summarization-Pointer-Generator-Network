A third U.S. tourist has been detained in North Korea with sources saying it was because he left a Bible in his hotel room.

Pyongyang confirmed that it had detained the man, named by the state news agency KCNA as Jeffrey Edward Fowle, in April for violating its laws after entering the secretive state, led by dictator Kim Jong Un.

They added that he was being questioned by authorities for conduct inappropriate for the purpose of his visit as a tourist.

The report gave no further details but Japan's Kyodo news agency cited unidentified diplomatic sources as saying the American was detained just before he about to leave the country for leaving the Bible in a hotel room.Â 

It is thought that agents in the state are particularly sensitive to religious material.

A State Department official said Washington was aware of reports that a third U.S. citizen had been detained in North Korea.

They confirmed: 'There is no greater priority for us than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad,' adding no further information was available.

Two other Americans are currently being held by North Korea having been arrested after arriving on tourist visas and accused of crimes against the state.

Korean American missionary Kenneth Bae has been in custody for 18 months after being arrested in 2012 and sentenced to 15 years of hard labour on charges of state subversion.

His family says he suffers from a variety of health issues, including diabetes, an enlarged heart, kidney stones and severe back pain.

A second man, named as Matthew Todd Miller, has been held since April, with KCNA saying he tore up his visa and demanded asylum.

North Korea has detained and then released other Americans in the past year, including Korean War veteran Merrill E. Newman, whom it expelled after holding him for more than a month accusing him of war crimes.

In May, the U.S. State Department issued an advisory urging Americans not to travel to North Korea because of the 'risk of arbitrary arrest and detention' even while holding valid visas.

'Foreign visitors to North Korea may be arrested, detained, or expelled for activities that would not be considered criminal outside North Korea,' it said.

Pyongyang has detained a number of U.S. citizens in recent years, using them as a tool to extract visits by high-profile figures, including former President Bill Clinton, for propaganda means.

North Korea periodically accuses the United States of military hostility and conspiracy to overthrow its leadership.

The two states have been locked in a tense diplomatic conflict over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes.

The United States has no diplomatic ties with North Korea and the interests of its citizens in the country are represented by Sweden, which has an embassy in Pyongyang.
