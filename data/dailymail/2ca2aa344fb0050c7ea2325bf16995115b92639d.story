Walks free: Fireworks display organiser Geoffrey Counsell leaves Bristol Crown Court yesterday as he was cleared of causing the deaths of seven and injuring 51 on the M5

A fireworks organiser accused of causing a motorway crash that killed seven and injured 51 says the authorities wanted 'someone to blame' as he was cleared of breaching health and safety law yesterday.

A judge directed a jury at Bristol Crown Court to find Geoffrey Counsell, 51, not guilty of a single charge of failing to ensure the safety of others contrary to the Health and Safety at Work Act.

Seven people died in a massive motorway pile-up involving more than 30 cars when they were engulfed by a thick fog on the M5 near Taunton at around 8.20pm on November 4 2011.

The smog was so thick that motorists on 
the northbound carriageway likened it to having a tin of paint thrown 
over their windscreens.

Geoffrey Counsell, 51, said he 
believed the decision to prosecute him was 'motivated by a desire to 
find someone to blame for this terrible accident, simply for the sake of
doing so'.

Speaking outside
Bristol Crown Court, he said: 'I would like to start by expressing my 
sympathy to all those who were affected by the terrible crash on 
November 4 2011.

'I have 
been through an appalling experience over the last two years, yet I 
recognise that my misfortune is as nothing compared with that of those 
bereaved and injured as a result of that accident.

Judge Justice Simon, who directed the jury at Bristol Crown Court to return a verdict of not guilty, said: 'The prosecution case required Mr Counsell to appreciate and react more or less instantly to something not thought to be a hazard to anyone and had no previous reason to think it was a hazard.'

He added: 'There was no proper basis that you could have concluded that a reasonable person would have appreciated a reasonable risk and reacted to it to stop the display.'

Mr Counsell was in charge of the massive event at a rugby club which saw 1,500 rockets fired during a 15 minute display.

Through his solicitor, Gavin Reese, Mr Counsell said outside court: 'Before
a final decision to go ahead with the display was taken, the Highways 
Agency, the Taunton Deane Borough Council and the Avon and Somerset 
Constabulary were consulted.

'All were informed of the fact and 
nature of the display. No objection of any kind was raised. As matters 
transpired, the Taunton Deane Borough Council and Avon and Somerset 
Constabulary were to be the agencies which prosecuted me in respect of 
that same display.

'The display was carried out without incident. It 
was a very foggy night and the fireworks produced some smoke, which 
would have mingled with the fog.

'However, I saw nothing to cause me to believe that any firework smoke would cause a hazard and I do not believe that it did so'.

Mr Counsell continued: 'The prosecution case against me was based on the suggestion that I should have recognised the risk of something occurring which has never been shown to have happened before, which probably did not happen, and risk of which was not recognised by anyone else.

'The judge noted when he ruled that there was no case to answer, the prosecution case was 'heavily weighted with hindsight".

'As many people will be aware, the assistant chief constable of Avon and Somerset Constabulary Mr (Anthony) Bangham appeared on national television less than 48 hours after the crash to advance the police belief that smoke from the display had caused the crash.

'Hours before the pronouncement was made, officers from Avon and Somerset Constabulary had unlawfully obtained a warrant to search my home, as the judge found during the trial.

'The unlawful search of my home took place despite the fact that I had previously expressly confirmed to the police my willingness to co-operate with their inquiry in any way.

'The current proceedings were brought jointly by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary and Taunton Deane Borough Council. Prior to the proceedings being brought, those representing me wrote to Taunton Deane Borough Council highlighting the obvious flaws in the case.

'Those concerns were simply ignored. Again, in August of this year, those representing me set out in court documents the very issues which caused the case to come to a halt. Nevertheless, the prosecution continued.

'I am obviously extremely relieved that I have been cleared of any blame for this terrible crash. So, whilst I am very relieved that, more than two years later, my ordeal is over, I continue to feel that my prosecution was motivated by a desire to find someone to blame for this terrible accident, simply for the sake of doing so.'

It was alleged that Mr Counsell, 
of Ashill in Somerset, failed to ensure he operated the firework display
so as to ensure, as far as was reasonably practicable, that others who 
might be affected were not exposed to risks to their health and safety.

Mr Counsell was originally charged with 
seven counts of manslaughter but they were dropped earlier this year and
instead he faced the health and safety charge.

Grandparents Anthony and Pamela Adams, from Newport, South Wales; father and daughter Michael and Maggie Barton, from Windsor, Berkshire; battle re-enactor Malcolm Beacham, from Woolavington, Somerset; and lorry drivers Terry Brice, from South Gloucestershire, and Kye Thomas, from Cornwall, died and 51 people were injured, including some seriously, in the pile-up.

Mr Counsell, who ran Firestorm Pyrotechnics, was the contractor hired by Taunton Rugby Club to run the £3,000 display at its ground, which was watched by 1,000 people.

He set off 1,500 shots as part of his Jupiter Display in 15 minutes - just 200 yards from the motorway.

In a leaflet promoting his business, the experienced Mr Counsell described the display as the 'biggest and most lavish' piece of 'unforgettable' pyrotechnics he offered.

Witnesses described seeing the smoke drift across the nearby carriageway.

Peter Blair QC, prosecuting, 
told the jury: 'Essentially the prosecution say they experienced a loss 
of visibility, generated, we say, by a plume of smoke created by Mr 
Counsell from his firework display which had built up.

Bereft: Elaine Adams, whose family members died in the accident on the M5, and spoke on behalf of all victims, said that she was 'devastated' by what had happened

'It was dispersed because of the lack of wind mixed with the humid air and drifted in the direction of the motorway.

'We
say people were exposed to an appreciable risk to their personal safety
that night as a consequence of the way Mr Counsell prepared for and 
then went about his business.

'We
say that ensuring the safety of people using that motorway needed 
particular care if you were going to undertake a big firework display 
involving the use of a substantial volume of these hazardous explosives,
which generated a lot of smoke.

'Smoke
can have an appreciable effect on reducing visibility - that should be 
obvious. It didn't take long from the build-up of smoke to the dramatic 
loss of visibility.

'We say 
if he had adequately undertaken his health and safety properly, some or 
all of the consequences which unfolded on November 4 may have been 
avoided.'

Elaine Adams, from Barry, South Wales, and daughter of Mr and Mrs Adams, said: 'I am speaking on behalf of all the families here and we are all absolutely devastated.

'We feel that things should have gone a little bit further and the judge should have made more of an informed decision.

'I am really upset. I am very, very cross about what happened.

'I am just devastated and I am really upset and, to be honest, as much as there has been a picture brought up over the last few weeks, there is still a lot of confusion.

'I think a lot of money has been wasted and I think there are things that could have been done that haven't been done.

'I would have liked to have seen the defence witnesses before the case was stopped.'

Pile-up: The emergency services consider the situation on the night that seven died and 51 were injured on the M5 in 2011

Aftermath: View of the wreckage which shows burnt out cars along the M5 where seven people died

Bristol Crown Court heard that the smog built up during and after a fireworks display at Taunton Rugby Club and drifted across the road

Pile-up: One driver said her car hit a patch of white mist as it entered the M5 at junction 25

Ms Adams said she still believed it was right to bring the prosecution.

'I
think perhaps health and safety are at fault for their guidance. 
Despite having evidence, their guidance is not clear,' she said.

John
Williams, leader of Taunton Deane Borough Council, said: 'I hope that 
the end of Crown Court proceedings brings some closure for the families,
friends and colleagues of those who lost their lives or suffered injury
in the terrible events on November 4 2011.

'The
council is now seeking to work closely with the relevant authorities to
see if the current guidance regarding large fireworks displays, such as
the one at Taunton Rugby Club, is appropriate.

'We
also pledge our support for any changes that may be deemed necessary. 
Our primary concern is to minimise the risks of this type of 
unimaginable incident happening again.

'On
behalf of the council, I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to 
the families of the bereaved and the families and friends of all those 
affected by these terrible events.

'I would also pay tribute to all those who showed such bravery at the scene, to all the emergency services and to staff at the hospitals where the injured were treated.

'There will be a coroner's inquest in due course and the coroner may make recommendations having heard the evidence laid before the inquest.'
