A Massachusetts woman has opened up about how she fell in love with the former 'Fattest Man in the World' after watching a documentary about the heavyweight Brit.

Despite a 3,400mile distance, Rebecca Mountain, 40, from Orange, MA, 'felt compelled' to contact Paul Mason, 52, who weighted more than 70stone at his heaviest, to help him with his plight.

Mr Mason, from Ipswich in Suffolk, England, lost 48stone following a gastric bypass, and appeared in a documentary about his life of obesity.

Romance: Rebecca Mountain, 40, wrote to British Paul Mason, once the world's fattest man, on Facebook after seeing him in a TV documentary about his life

Miss Mountain, got in touch with Mr 
Mason on Facebook to offer her help in raising funds for him to have an 
operation to remove excess skin following his extraordinary weight loss.

'People
look at a person and make a judgement but anyone who talks to Paul sees
there is more to him,' Miss Mountain told The Daily Mirror.

'His obesity made him the man he is and that turned him into the person I love.'

An equally smitten Mr Mason, a former 
postman, says he cannot wait to spend the rest of his life with Miss 
Mountain, despite the pair never having met in real life

'I can't think about anyone else and nor can she,' he said.

Smitten: As Rebecca, from Orange, near Boston and Paul, from Ipswich, Suffolk, live 3,400 miles apart, the couple have to talk on Skype until Miss Mountain can come to the UK

The pair met online last month when Miss Mountain, of Orange, near Boston, Massachusetts, saw a television documentary about Mr Mason's extreme obesity - the result, he says, of overeating when a previous relationship ended.

Miss Mountain was so touched by Paul's story that she got in touch via Facebook to offer her help in Mr Mason's bid to get the British National Health Service to pay for a second operation to rid him of layers of excess skin.

According to Mr Mason, Miss Mountain did not contact him with the intention of starting a relationship but after their initial online conversation the pair became an item.

Mr Mason said: 'I was a bit cautious to start with but as soon as I met her on Skype I felt at ease. We talked for four-and-a-half hours.

'I didn't know anything about her but we talked all about her life and how she wants to help me.'

'It wasn't until the second conversation that I realised there was more there than just friends. She felt the same and brought up the idea of us being boyfriend and girlfriend.'

Mr Mason says that he doesn't go for looks and finds Miss Mountain's determined attitude particularly attractive.

He said: 'I am more interested in the person rather than the physical side of things. She really wants to come over and see me and I am just desperate to meet her face-to-face, I am so excited.

'It
is her personality, her drive and passion and she has a lovely smile 
that made me fall for her. Like me she is a very determined person, I 
really adore that quality in her.

'I'm more determined than ever to get this operation and enjoy my life with her'

Love letters: A hand crafted that Paul has made to send to Rebecca

Mr Mason ballooned to 70 stone after losing his father in his 20s triggered a compulsive eating disorder.

At the height of his food addiction, his daily breakfast would consist of an entire packet of bacon, four sausages and four eggs 
complete with bread and hash browns.

He would then eat quadruple portions of 
fish and chips along with two kebabs for lunch followed by a roast 
dinner, curries or pizza and more chips in the evening.

Mr Mason was forced to quit his job as a postman when his weight prevented him from completing his deliveries.

As his weight soared he was left unable 
to stand or walk before finally becoming bed-ridden and being looked 
after full time by council carers.

Firefighters had to demolish the front 
wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to 
lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed a hernia 
operation in 2002.

Mr Mason was later given a purpose-built housing association home with extra wide doorways so he could move around.

He lost more than half of his body weight after a gastric bypass operation, paid for by the British taxpayer, in 2010.

He is now fighting to raise funds to get his excess skin removed, something which Rebecca plans to help him with once in the UK.
