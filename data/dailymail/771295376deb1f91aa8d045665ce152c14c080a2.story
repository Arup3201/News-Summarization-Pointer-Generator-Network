An illegal taxi driver has been jailed for 10 years for raping a young woman put in his cab by her friend who wanted to make sure she got home safely. 

Abdel Baisar, 34, picked up his victim in the early hours of June 20 last year in Leicester Square, central London after she was on a night out with friends.

Baisar, who already had a conviction for taxi-touting, was driving in the area when he picked up the victim.

A well-meaning friend feared the 23-year-old was too drunk to make her own way home so put her into the back of Baisar's cab.

He drove the woman to her address in south east London and then attacked her.

The victim woke up to discover she had been raped.

Baisar was traced through a match on the National DNA database and arrested on July 16. He was charged the following day.

Baisar of Tulse Hill, south London pleaded not guilty to the offence but the jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict.

He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment at Woolwich Crown Court after being found guilty of rape on January 19.

He must also sign the sex offenders register for life.

In the unlikely event he is ever granted a minicab licence again, the court ruled he must declare himself a convicted rapist to any single female fares.

Detective Constable Mark Azariah of the Metropolitan Police's Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command, said: 'I would like to praise the bravery of the victim in coming forward to the police in this distressing case and supporting the investigation.

'I would urge anyone to come forward to the police in such cases and work with us to convict these predatory males who target women when they are at their most vulnerable.

'I hope that the sentence handed down by the Judge goes some way in helping the victim recover from this ordeal.'
