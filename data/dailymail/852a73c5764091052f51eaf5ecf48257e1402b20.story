San Francisco 49ers player Aldon Smith was arrested on Sunday at Los Angeles Airport after allegedly telling security officers he had a bomb while being uncooperative during a bag search.

In footage posted online the 6ft 4in linebacker can be seen speaking with officers before being lead away, telling them he'd done nothing wrong and saying they would be 'embarrassed'.

Smith was arrested around 2pm and booked on one count of 'false report of a bomb', a charge which carries a penalty of up to one year behind bars. He has been released after posting $20,000 bail.

According to a police statement Smith became 'belligerent' 
while waiting on a Terminal 1 security line and was randomly picked for a
 second screening.

Sgt. Karla Ortiz said: 'At
 approximately 1400 hrs, a 25-year-old male resident of San Jose, 
California, was going through Terminal 1 screening and was randomly 
selected for a secondary screening.

'The suspect then became belligerent and uncooperative with the process and with the TSA agent, making a comment indicating that he was in possession of a bomb before proceeding towards the gate area.

'Los Angeles Airport Police made contact with him at the gate and he was positively identified as the person in question. 

'Once again the male subject became uncooperative and he was detained and taken into custody by Airport Police and is currently being transported to LAPD for booking.'

Eyewitness John Egan told the San Jose Mercury News that Smith was just agitated.

'I heard him say, "I did nothing wrong,"' Egan said. 'The whole thing ratcheted up from there. The cops were trying to calm him down. He wasn't out of control; just agitated.'

49ers general manager Trent Baalke also released a statement, expressing his disappointment.

'We are disappointed to learn of the incident today involving Aldon Smith,' Baalke said. 'As this is a pending legal matter and we are still gathering the pertinent facts, we will have no further comment.'

Sports fans have taken to Twitter to criticise Smith, calling him 'stupid', 'dumb' and calling for him to leave the team.

One user,  Mike S, said: 'I'm a diehard Niners fan, and he's a great player. But Aldon Smith has got to go,' while cesinha added: 'Aldon Smith is plain stupid.'

While most of the comments were crtical of Smith, or poked fun at 49ers fans, there was some support for the controversial player.

Jaelin Wilson said: 'Too much talent for it all to go to waste; hope Aldon Smith gets himself right.'

The incident is the latest in a string of legal issues for Smith, SFGate notes.

In November 2013 Smith pled not guilty to three illegal firearms charges relating to a 2012 party at his home. Smith was reportedly stabbed at the party and two others were shot.

Smith has also been arrested twice for DUI since 2012, the website says. He spent five weeks at a treatment center this fall and missed five games.
