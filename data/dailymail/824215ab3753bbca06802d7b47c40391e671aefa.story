Fly-tippers dumped a caravan filled with household rubbish at one of the country's most beautiful nature reserves.

Park rangers at Cotswold Water Park said today it was one of the 'worst incidents' they had seen after they were confronted with mounds of litter and the crushed vehicle.

The caravan had been split in two, spilling sacks full of waste, gas canisters, toys and an old scooter  into the reserve. 

The crushed caravan was filled with scooters, rubbish and white goods and dumped at Cotswold Water Park

The waste was discovered by locals on Tuesday at Waterhay car park near Ashton Keynes, Wiltshire.

The entrance to the car park was blocked by the intact bottom half of the vehicle and the top half was dumped inside. 

The fly-tippers destroyed the height barriers at the entrance to the car park by towing the overflowing vehicle.

The bungling fly-tippers then realised they had blocked their escape route so had to saw down the gate posts to clear a space to drive through.

A spokesperson for the Cotswold Water Park (CWP) Trust described the incident as 'one of the worst' in the area's history.

The wheels of the caravan are only just visible beneath the mound of toys, duvets and even gas canisters

Cotswold Water Park was created over the last 50 years and is a significant area for wildlife

They said: 'With incidents of fly 
tipping on the increase, one of the worst recorded incidents here in the
Cotswold Water Park took place this week at a car park managed by the 
CWP Trust.

'Waterhay Car Park is a popular starting 
point for birdwatchers, horse riders, cyclists and walkers accessing the 
Thames path and the many lakes in the area.'

The spokesperson added that Wiltshire Police had been informed.

The Trust said it took 24 hours to clear the wreckage and needed the help of the ranger team, local farmers Richard Rummings, Nick and Chris Freeth and local mechanic Matt Freeth,

The team were also able to fix the height and entrance barriers to reopen the car park.

The Cotswold Water Park is an area of
40 square miles in the catchment area of the Upper Thames, set across 
the countryside of Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and West Oxfordshire.

Attracting more than 500,000 visitors a
year, it is home to a variety of watery wildlife - including ducks, 
water voles, otters, dragonflies, and bats.

There are now more than 150 lakes with 100km of footpaths and cycle routes winding their way around the picturesque scenery.

The landscape in the park is constantly changing and in fifty years it will be the largest inland wetland in Europe.
