Three people were shot dead Monday night at a town meeting in Pennsylvania.

Rockne Newell, 59, who was feuding with Ross Township officials over living conditions at his home, is accused of firing gunshots through the wall before bursting into the municipal building.

Pennsylvania state police said he was tackled to the ground and shot in the leg.

Witnesses said the gunman went to his car to get another weapon before he was tackled.

At least two people were injured in the shootout and at least one of the three men shot dead was a town official.

'I heard more than 10 shots,' Pocono Record reporter Chris Reber said, who was at the meeting.

'It was automatic, like a string of firecrackers.'

State police said about 15 to 18 residents and town officials were at the building, a short drive from Newell's property, when the gunfire erupted.

Two people died at the scene, and a third person died after being flown to a hospital.

A woman was undergoing surgery late Monday. 

One person was shot 
in the leg, two were shot in the stomach and one was shot in the head, 
according to the Pocono Record.

Investigators said Newell began shooting as he approached the building and continued as he walked into and through it.

He then went back out to his vehicle in the parking lot, retrieved a handgun and went back into the building, firing more shots, police said.

Reber said he was at the township building when a man armed with a long gun with a scope shot through a wall into the meeting.

'The thing that got my attention: 
plaster flying out, blowing out through the walls. Witnesses would later
tell me they saw pictures exploding away from the walls,' Reber said in
the first-person account told to his editors Marta Gouger and Chris 
Mele.

He said he crawled out to a hallway, exited the building and took cover behind a vehicle.

'The gunman was this guy wearing a 
blue Hawaiian shirt,' he said. 'I saw him go back out to his car, a 
silver Impala, and get another gun.

'It wasn't real to me until I went back inside and saw people bleeding.'

A township official tending to the wounded man was able to wrestle the gunman to the ground, actually shooting him with his own gun during the scuffle, Reber added.

‘(West End Open Space Commission 
executive director) Bernie Kozen was there tending to the man and he 
(the shooter) didn't see them,’ Reber continued. ‘Bernie bearhugged him 
and took him down. He shot (the shooter) with his own gun.’

‘Mr. Kozen is a true hero tonight,’ Rep. Matt Cartwright, who represents the state's 17th District Cartwright said.

Three hospitals: Victims, including suspected gunman Newell, were taken to three separate hospitals, according to reports

At war: Newell has been at war with the town over the use of his property, which is reportedly being searched by Pennsylvania State Police

Newell had been in a long-running 
dispute with township officials over the dilapidated condition of his 
property, state police Capt. Edward Hoke said.

The township supervisors voted in 
February 2012 to take legal action against Newell for violating zoning 
and sewer regulations, according to meeting minutes posted online.

Last October, Newell set up a 
fundraising page online and was trying to raise $10,000 to pay for legal
fees in his battle with the township.

'Ross township took me to court & 
the court ruled I have to vacate my home of 20 years,' he wrote on the 
page called saveRockyshome. 'I live on SSI which comes to $600 a month I
have no money to clean it up.'

Newell said his two rescue dogs 'will be put to sleep because no one else will take them.'

The property includes an old camper in
the front yard filled with wooden pallets, pieces of what appear to be 
old railroad ties and trash. A garage leans and appears close to 
collapse, and a propane tank sits inside an old dog house.

State police, who guarded the property early Tuesday, were awaiting a search warrant so they can enter it.

In June, the Pocono Record wrote a 
story about what it said was an 18-year fight between the township and 
Newell over his property.

Pennsylvania State Police confirmed Newell was arrested and said three people were killed in the shooting

Monroe County Court in August 2012 sided with the township and ordered Newell to vacate and never again occupy or use the property unless he had the permits to do so. The report said Newell had been living out of a car, a 1984 Pontiac Fiero, and in abandoned buildings since being ordered to vacate.

Newell told the paper he was unemployed for years after an injury from a crash and had nowhere else to go.

'They have no right to kick me off my property,' he told the newspaper. 'They call my property an eyesore. When I bought it, it was one of only three properties on the entire road that didn't have what they call junk.'

Newell was in police custody after being treated at the hospital Monday night.

Ross Township has about 5,500 residents

Newell told the Record this past June he couldn’t afford the septic hookup fees, and eerily complained about his perceived treatment.

‘If I lose this property, I have nowhere else to go,’ said Newell, adding 'what they're doing to me, what they've been doing to me for so long, it's wrong.’

Authorities have yet to bring charges against Newell but are holding him while his property is searched.
