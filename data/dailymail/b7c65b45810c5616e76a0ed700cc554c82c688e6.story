The thought of entering the dating scene as a woman in her 50s was a daunting idea for Liz Sherriff.

She only had two long-term partners - first her ex-husband then a toyboy who was 21 years her junior.

Neither of them worked out and she was forced to seek other options.

But what Ms Sherriff quickly and painfully learned was that in the world of online dating, a 'rotten profile photo' will attract all the wrong people.

This was the motivation behind the launch of 'The Look of Love' last month - a Sydney-based makeover studio dedicated purely to producing profile pictures for online dating.

Ms Sherriff, who has been a single mum for 16 years, never thought she would find love online.

And having met both her ex-husband of 16 years and previous partner of six years at work, internet dating was a foreign concept.

'Now I've been online dating for about 18 months,' Ms Sherriff told Daily Mail Australia.  

'When I first started I had no idea and thought I'd put up any old rotten profile photo. I found that many of the men who were contacting me weren't serious and were just looking for a fling.

'Then I changed my photo to a better one only to find that I was having more success with men who were genuinely interested and were on the same level of intelligence.'

That one photo made a world of difference for Ms Sherriff and she wanted to share this with fellow love-seekers.

'It was a real eye opener for me and I've come to realise that a picture of yourself when it comes to online dating is very important,' she said.

'A profile photo gives insight into the person. It says a lot about them, their style and their lifestyle.

'For example, if I came across Harry Highpants then I just wouldn't be interested. I have a check list and I totally agree that a picture is worth a thousand words.'

Photos taken by the studio aims to  produce 'natural and real photos of people looking their best'

As the co-founder of The Look of Love, suitably inspired by Dusty Springfield's pop song, Ms Sherriff is now using her experience to help others show their 'inner beauty'.

'It's not about photo-shopping pictures but more about producing natural and real photos of people looking their best,' she said.

'We want to bring out their personality and character in the image, not something that's glamorous.'

Ms Sherriff believes the Christmas period will not only be a busy time for shopper but also for those who are searching for 'the one'.

'People have a lot more time because they're on holidays,' she said.

'It's also a poignant time of year which highlights the fact that they're alone.

'I know this because I've been there before - I remember times that I sat on the couch and cried on Christmas Day when my kids were with my ex.

'This is why this idea for a makeover studio is close to my heart.' 

While Ms Sherriff is taking a break from the dating scene as she's found herself a man, the 55-year-old says the whole experience has been 'a great learning curve'.

'There is someone out there for everyone,'  she said.

'I hope the experience at our studio will bring out the confidence in people and I want them to know that if I'm able to do it, then anyone can.'

Set up a 'date phone' with an alternative mobile number, Liz Sherriff said.

'Just get an old handset and get a new SIM card. Do pay as you go. 

'Don't give out the real one until you trust the person.

'Same goes for your email address. Set up an account with your dating name.'

PROFILE WARNINGS

1) If they don't have a photo it generally means they are either married or ugly. Always ask to see a photo before you start communicating;

2) Beware of black and white photos - probably retouched or taken years earlier;

3) For fuzzy, out of focus and distant photos - assume reason one;

4) Head only shot or a profile description which says 'a bit overweight or large-ish' means they're probably gargantuan;

5) High school education only - sorry this is a bit sweeping but I need a conversation with my partner;

6) People who put a picture up of them when they were 17-years-old is  because of reasons one, four or five;

7) 'Undecided' about having kids means they want kids so beware if you don't or can't; 

8) Never been married, if older, means a real lack of commitment - I learned the hard way; 

9) The word 'milf' in their wish list unless of course you're up for it;

10) Anywhere the word 'lonely' comes up.
