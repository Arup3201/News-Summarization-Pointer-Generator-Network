As hundreds of Apple fans around the world spent the night queuing for the latest iPhone, it has been revealed that Americans have spent some $5.9 billion on repairing the device since the first edition was released in 2007.

A one-year warranty is provided by Apple on iPhones, but this covers product malfunction as opposed to user clumsiness.

The primary reason for a damaged iPhone was the device being dropped by a user.

The second-most cited reason was 'immersing the phone in liquid' such as dropping it in the toilet or in a drink.

The prize: Apple's new iPhone 5, which has been eagerly awaited

SquareTrade, a company that provides 
independent warranties for tech gadgets, surveyed more than 2,000 iPhone
users, reported TIME Moneyland.

They asked users about how they had damaged their phones, then extended the cost of repairs, replacements and insurance deductibles
across the mass of iPhone users.  

The average price of repairing an iPhone screen is usually between $100 and $150.

According to SquareTrade, 11 per cent of iPhone owners are happy to carry on using the device with a cracked screen.

They also said that six per cent of users have used tape to keep their phone together.

But Ty Shay, chief marketing officer 
of SquareTrade, does point out to the website that the usage of mobile 
phones has increased significantly since the iPhone was first relased, 
thereby increasing the risk of accidents.

But the cost of repairs has not deterred users.

From London to New York to Sydney, fans have camped outside Apple stores for the latest release, the iPhone 5.

As Apple opened the doors of its stores around the world, staff greeted the first customers with high fives and cheers.

The dozens of die-hard Apple fans had swollen into huge queues of hundreds by the early hours of Friday morning, as excitement reached fever pitch hours before the release of the updated handset.

Although the majority were there to get their hands on their own new iPhone, the anticipation surrounding its release has reached such levels that many were planning on making a quick buck by selling the handsets for as much as $1,200 -- close to double the retail price.

In London, many were prepared to sell their place in the queue for four-figure sums and Apple fans in New York were also planning to tout their positions to the many workers passing by before the 8am opening time.

At Fifth Avenue Apple store in the Big Apple, the frontrunners for the gadget had already been queuing since last Thursday, putting up with the rough sleeping to get their hands on the sought-after device first.
