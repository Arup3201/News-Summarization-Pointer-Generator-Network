Restrained: The Mayor of London said firearms officers had attended 10,000 incidents in the last four years

Boris Johnson praised Scotland Yard’s armed police units as ‘fantastically restrained’ yesterday.

The Mayor of London said firearms officers were deployed to around 10,000 incidents over the last four years, and only fired their weapons on six occasions.

Mr Johnson was among several senior political figures who rallied round the Metropolitan Police following the Duggan inquest verdict.

David Cameron appealed for a calm response from family and supporters to the verdict that Duggan was lawfully killed by a police marksman.

The Prime Minister said he hoped people would respect the ‘proper judicial process’ and welcomed the stance taken by Duggan’s aunt Carole, who said she wanted ‘no more violence’.

Mr Cameron also backed a proposal to make armed officers wear cameras and microphones to record their actions.

‘We have to respect judicial processes in this country, we have to respect the outcome of trials and the work that juries do,’ the Prime Minister told BBC London.

‘I very much respect Mark Duggan’s aunt for saying they want to pursue their case through the courts rather than on the streets, I think that’s absolutely right.’

Mr Cameron acknowledged there was still some racial prejudice in the UK but said efforts were being made to ‘break down the barriers’. He said: ‘We are on a journey, we haven’t cracked all these problems. There is still racial prejudice, there is still discrimination.

‘But I think what you can see is governments of all colours, whether Labour or Conservative, have been trying to break down these barriers and try to make sure that people are valued for  the passion in their heart and  the thoughts in their head rather than the colour of their skin or their sexuality.

Protection: David Cameron called for armed officers to wear cameras and microphones on duty

‘We have made huge progress over the years but there is always more to do.’

Mr Johnson expressed his  sympathy for Duggan’s family, but emphasised the ‘incredible pressure’ under which armed police operate. ‘On any given day highly trained Met firearms officers can and do face life-threatening situations in which they have to make instant judgements under incredible pressure,’ the mayor said.

Deputy Prime Minister: Nick Clegg said there were 'questions to be asked' about how investigations into police shootings are handled

‘Our police were deployed to armed responses about 10,000 times in the last four years, and only on six occasions have they actually fired their weapons, discharged police weapons.

‘No police operation begins with the intention of ending with the loss of life of a member of the  public. And I just would stress that if you look at how our police operate they are fantastically restrained, and those split-second decisions are all the more difficult if someone is clearly carrying a lethal weapon.’

However, a leading Government crime adviser blamed the police reaction to the shooting for widespread riots in London in 2011.

Shaun Bailey, a former aide to David Cameron, said their failure to speak directly with the Duggan family, coupled with the mixed messages coming out of Scotland Yard in the aftermath of the killing, made people take to the streets across the country.

‘They should have had one  very senior officer, who was speaking to the Press and the public alone, and not had all these different conflicting stories coming out,’ he said.

‘They should have gone straight to the family and dealt with the family directly – that’s the kind of thing that started the riot, and not the fact that Mark Duggan had been shot.’

Nick Clegg said there were ‘questions to be asked’ about how investigations into police shootings are handled.

The Deputy Prime Minister said that while he ‘totally understood’ the angry reaction to the finding in some quarters, he wanted to stress that the case had been considered by a jury.

He said: ‘This is a jury made up of people randomly selected just like anyone else who has been called up for jury service.

‘It is not the police acting as judge and jury.’
