It seems that Paula Deen isn't the only member of her family that can't keep out of trouble.

Her brother, Earl 'Bubba' Hiers, who owns Uncle Bubba's Seafood & Oyster House in Savannah, Georgia, received a less than stellar public health inspection report for his restaurant, with violations that included inadequate hand washing facilities for staff and not keeping some foods at the right cold temperature.

Two of the violations during the Feb. 7 visit from health inspectors was for repeat offenses, according to the official report posted by Radar Online.

Paula Deen and her brother Bubba Hiers attend Paula Deen's Kitchen grand opening at Chicago Harrah's Joliet Casino & Hotel on April 5, 2012

One was for using a hand sink as a dump 
sink, and the other was for not keeping foods that need to be kept cold 
below 41 degrees Fahrenheit. With the latter violation, the food in 
question was thrown out and the problem corrected during the visit.

Overall, Uncle Bubba's received a score of 83 out of 100, which is considered a 'B' rating by the Georgia Department of Public Health. Scores between 70 and 79 are given a 'C.'

However, the restaurant's cleanliness score has dropped since its prior inspection on Nov. 6, 2013, when it scored a 90, earning an 'A' rating.

Bubba may want to seek the advice of her sister when it comes to keeping a restaurant more in line with health codes. Paula Deen's Savannah restaurant, Lady & Sons, was visited by health inspectors on Feb. 4, and earned a near perfect score of 98, an 'A' rating. She lost two points for a couple of relatively minor violations.

One was for not keeping salad bar plates and bowls properly covered which could lead to contamination and the other was for not having test strips available at a sanitizer sink at the bar station.

However, Lady & Sons has tended to run a tight ship when it comes to cleanliness as it also received 'A' rating during two health inspections last year. But this wasn't always the case.

In 2012, the restaurant was cited for 'food-contact surfaces encrusted with grease and/or soil deposits,â€
