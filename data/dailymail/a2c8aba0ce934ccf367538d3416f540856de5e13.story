Manchester City started their UEFA Youth League campaign with an emphatic victory over 10-man Bayern Munich on Wednesday afternoon.

Jack Byrne handed City the lead after 26 minutes at the Grunwalder Stadion and the English club’s cause was helped when Bayern goalkeeper David Hundertmark was sent off 10 minutes later for handling outside the box.

It allowed Patrick Vieira’s team to take a firm grip on the match and Jose Angel Pozo doubled the lead shortly before the break. 

Manchester City's Angelino (C) inspired his side to a 4-1 victory over Bayern Munich Under 19s

The contest was settled on the hour mark when Angelino, City’s stand-out player, took in a pass from Brandon Barker and confidently stroked the ball home.

It got even better for the visitors six minutes later when Kosovan Bersant Celina blasted home after Olivier Ntcham had set him up.

Thierry Ambrose nearly made it five late on but headed against the crossbar.

Bayern eventually scored a late consolation in stoppage time through Philipp Walter but the result was never in any doubt after the Germans were reduced to 10-men.

Roma beat CSKA Moscow 3-1 in the day’s other game and City will play the Italians next on September 30.

Meanwhile, Chelsea also got their campaign off to a winning start with a simikar 4-1 victory over Schalke at Cobham.
