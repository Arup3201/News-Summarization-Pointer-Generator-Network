Drew Brees tried his best to stay out of the deflate-gate controversy, but his performance on Conan Wednesday will undoubtedly be pointed to as evidence of ...something. 

The New Orleans Saints quarterback was easily able to tell an under-inflated football from one that was within legal rules during a brief demonstration on the show. 

It isn't clear whether the gag on Conan was staged - but Brees could tell the inflation of two footballs - down to the pounds-per-square-inch.

When asked about the deflate-gate scandal, Brees demurred: 'You know what? I have no idea. I know that it seems the NFL has been on this one now for the last few weeks.

Drew Brees correctly determined that one football handed to him was 11psi - under-inflated - and other was 13psi - NFL legal

Brees knows from footballs. He is a former Super Bowl MVP and the youngest ever-quarterback to pass for 50,000 yards in his career - one of only six in NFL history

'Obviously there always seems to be some topic going into Super Bowl week and this one just happens to be it. And yes, I will be asked this a thousand times and to be honest with you, I kind of chuckle because I'm just glad it has nothing to do with us.'

When Conan O'Brien asked the former Super Bowl MVP whether they thought he could tell the different between an under-inflated ball and a legal one, he said: 'Throughout the course of a game, no. A ball will come up and you don't even think about how it feels. You're just programmed to go through your read, throw the ball, no excuses.'

'But we if sat here and just gripped one, I could probably tell the difference.'

Conan handed Brees two footballs. The first, he correctly guessed at 13psi - within the NFL legal limit. 

The second, he guessed - correctly again - was 11 psi, illegal according to the rules of the NFL.

The AFC Champion New England Patriots have been under the intense scrutiny ever since they won their trip to the Super Bowl earlier this month. 

Investigators found that 11 of the 12 balls used by the offense were at least 2psi below the 12.5psi league minimum. 

Quarterback Tom Brady, who is on his way to a record sixth Super Bowl, has repeatedly denied having any knowledge that the balls were under-inflated - despite such footballs being easier to catch and throw and harder to fumble.
