For most of us, tomorrow's Winter Solstice is little more than another chilly December day. But for Kevin Carlyon, 55, from St Leonards on Sea in East Sussex, it has a much deeper meaning.

For Kevin is a white witch, and for him, and others like him, the shortest day of the year is one of the most important.

The reason, explains Kevin, is because the day marks the turn of the season, the rebirth of the sun and the slow march towards warmer summer days.

Nature: Kevin taps into the power in the atmosphere around him as he prepares for an outdoor ceremony

'The main thing will be to celebrate rebirth 
of the sun,' he explains. 'I will be lighting a big bonfire to welcome the sun back.'

But Kevin's day won't end there. As the self-described high priest of British witches, his day will also involve another ceremony - a hand-fasting or pagan marriage.

'It's basically a nice little ceremony,' he elaborates. 'A circle 
will be cast in my garden, although at moment with forecast, it looks like it will be in my living room instead, for the four elements of air, fire, earth and water.

'The couple will be 
wearing robes and will be inside the circle with me. It's spiritually binding like a Christian marriage - the only difference is that there's no pagan divorce ceremony!'

The handfasting will be followed by a feast for Kevin and 30 guests, complete with lashings of wine, to celebrate the Solstice.

Important: Kevin is the high priest of British witches and also conducts hand-fasting ceremonies

Important: Candles are a favourite tool for spell-casting and are particularly precious at the Solstice

'They range from policemen
 to housewives,' adds Kevin. 'People bring what they 
want to eat and we'll have a mini feast.'

It's a far cry from Kevin's usual day, which involves channelling his power for the benefit of supplicants from all over the world with problems that only a white witch can solve.

Most, he admits, involve mending broken relationships and finding lost pets, although he also reveals that there are some requests that he simply won't entertain.

'The most common request is to do with relationship break ups,' he explains. 'There are lots of women who are married to people having affairs.

'Quite a lot of them want to 
make the man's willy stop working for anyone else. If I hear all 
of the circumstancesÂ  and I feel that what I've heard is genuine, then I'll help but I'm very strict about it.

'I 
won't help people who've been out and cheated on their partners and have decided they want them back or anyone who has been violent.'

Most of the rituals he performs, all of which are unique to him, involve lighting candles or using crystals - both of which he has been doing since he was 16.

'The first spell I ever did was when I was 16 and it was 
to find someones lost cat,' he remembers. 'The lady lived by the marina and was convinced the cat had died.

Solstice: The Winter Solstice is celebrated by pagans like Kevin with bonfires to welcome the reborn sun

Service: Another part of Kevin's work is infusing crystals with energy aimed at tackling illness and infertility

'I did my hocus pocus and lit a candle over a photo of the cat, and 
three days later, she called me and said "you have to come down here and see this".'

'I went along to her basement flat and found eight to nine cats sitting outside -
including her own.'

Other popular services include charms to boost fertility, the removal of jinxes caused by intense hatred or black magic, and getting rid of unwanted paranormal visitors.

For now, Kevin is looking forward to the coming holiday, which he says, also shines a light on the origins of British Christmas traditions.

'In [pre-Christian] pagan
 culture, people used to light fires and candles to celebrate the rebirth of the sun.

'Later, of course, the Christian church replaced the rebirth of the sun with the birth of Jesus but most of what we do at Christmas is pagan.'

And what will he be doing on Christmas Day? 'I'll be chilling out and watching the telly like everyone else!'

'It's a particularly good time to wish for improved relationships as well as help with fertility problems,' explains Kevin. 'And it's nice to put a bit of holly and mistletoe around your candle too.'

WHAT TO DO

Get a brand new candle and place it inside a circle made from a piece of string or in a round bowl.

Visualise your wish and light the candle just before 5.11pm on the 21st.

As you light it visualise your wish and say 'As I make my wish, be it done, speed it well, power to the sun'.

Blow out the candle and as the smoke rises, visualise your wish going out to the world.
