A carjacker allegedly threatened to strip a teen of his clothes, burn his belongings and baptize him in Satan's blood.

Brandon Morris, 18, was leaving the car park of a motel in Anderson County, South Carolina, when Robert Cheek, 38, allegedly climbed into his car on November 5. 

Morris told police that Cheek, who was shirtless, told him to drive or he would kill him, reports Fox Carolina.

Robert Cheek, 38, allegedly threatened to strip Brandon Morris, 18,  of his clothes, burn his belongings and baptize him in Satan's blood

He said Cheek pistol-whipped him as he told him that he belonged to the Aryan Brotherhood, a white supremacist group, and mentioned recruiting Morris.  

'He told me he was going to baptize me in the blood of Satan,' Morris told Fox News.

'He was telling me how he knew of this clean body of water, he was gonna take me there and baptize me and burn all of my belongings and leave me in my underwear to walk away. 

'And that's actually the only way I would live... if he baptized me.'

The pair then drove to a garage, where they are both seen on a surveillance tape, which has not been released.

But Morris (center pictured with his wife and brother) is now worried for his life and his family as Cheek told his driver's license and his social security card so knows where he lives

According to the police report, Cheek then demanded to drive the Volvo, and when he got out of the car, Morris tried to flee by driving off following the hour-long ordeal. 

But Cheek held on to the luggage hooks on the top of the car and started kicking the windscreen, leading Morris to crash the car.

Cheek fled and was arrested December 11 after a deputy recognized him.

He was being bonded of out jail on Saturday. 

But Morris is now worried for his life as Cheek told his driver's license and his social security card so knows where he lives.

The family are so fearful of reprisals that they are moving home. 

His wife told Fox News that she was worried Cheek may attack them - including her young daughter.
