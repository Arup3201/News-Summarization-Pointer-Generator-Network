 Curbing immigration to Britain would be a 'disaster', Tony Blair has claimed in a warning against Labour copying Ukip policies.

The former prime minister said Labour must be 'really careful' of saying things that suggested Nigel Farage's party is justified in its policies.

The intervention comes as Ed Miliband faces the prospect of Labour being defeated by Ukip in the election of a new police and crime commissioner in South Yorkshire.

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair said Labour must deal with Ukip 'by what you believe'

Labour has been stung by the dramatic rise in popularity of Ukip, only narrowly holding the previously safe seat of Heywood and Middleton in this month's by-election.

Recent polls have put Ukip on as much as 19 per cent, with Labour neck and neck with the Tories.

Some senior Labour figures, including rising star Chuka Umunna, have launched strongly-worded attacks on the 'absolutely vile' views of 'racists' in Ukip.

However, Mr Miliband has come under pressure to take a tougher stance on immigration and Europe to prevent the loss of working class voters.

Last week he announced that a Labour government would immediately bring in an Immigration Bill and said the EU 'needs to change if we are to deal with the problems of immigration'.

But Mr Blair insisted Labour should focus on its own values and not appear to lend credibility to Ukip's policies on halting immigration and leaving the EU.

He said the way to tackle the threat from Ukip was to 'deal with it by what you believe'.

Ukip has jumped four points to 19 per cent - one point above their previous highest rating in a ComRes telephone poll in June

He told Progress magazine: 'Let's be clear: We don't think that Ukip's right, not on immigration and not on Europe - so the first thing you've got to be really careful of doing is ... saying things that suggest that they're kind of justified in their policy because what you're actually going to do is validate their argument when in fact you don't believe in it.'

Stopping immigration would be 'a disaster for this country', he said.

Labour must not 'end up chasing after the policies of a party like Ukip, who you don't agree with, whose policies would take this country backwards economically, politically, in every conceivable way, and who, ultimately, at the heart of what they do, have a rather nasty core of prejudice that none of us believe in, which you've actually got to take on and fight. So the way to deal with this is to deal with it by what you believe'.

Mr Blair claimed the way David Cameron is dealing with the threat from Ukip 'doesn't do them any electoral favours at all'.

He claimed the Tories would be better off at the ballot box 'if they actually stood up against these people and said 'you don't understand the way the world works today, your policies will take us backwards and we're not going there'.'

Mr Blair added: 'There's a huge desire in a large part of the media in this country to return British politics to a traditional Tory party fighting a traditional Labour party.'

That would lead to a 'traditional result', he warned. 

Ed Miliband is facing a battle to hold off Ukip in his own back yard today – as voters go to the polls in South Yorkshire to elect a new police commissioner.

A defeat for Labour would be seen as a major blow for Mr Miliband whose Doncaster constituency lies in the South Yorkshire police force area.

Today’s contest was sparked by the resignation of Labour’s previous police commissioner Shaun Wright – who stood down in the wake of the Rotherham child sex abuse scandal, where an estimated 1,400 children were abused over 16 years by Pakistani gangs.

Ukip has exploited the child abuse scandal to attack Labour. Last week, the party launched a poster featuring a young woman with the slogan: ‘There are 1,400 reasons why you should not trust Labour again’.

Nigel Farage told MailOnline the election was be close – despite his party finishing a distant fourth in the 2012 contest.

He said: ‘It will be nip and tuck. We definitely feel that if we win this it will add fuel to the fire that from Birmingham northwards, if you vote Conservative you get Labour.’

Mr Farage hopes it can keep its current momentum going by securing the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner post following its recent by-election success in Clacton.

Voters are going to the polls across the Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster - but the turnout is expected to barely top 10 per cent amid widespread disinterest.

Ukip’s candidate for the position is the retired police officer Jack Clarkson. Labour has chosen retired Anglican priest Alan Billings as its candidate – in a bid to distance itself from the Rotherham scandal.

There will be almost as much interest in how many of the 1,010,599 electorate bother to cast their votes as there will be on which of the four candidates wins when the by-election result is announced in Barnsley tomorrow.

Mr Wright's initial refusal to step down highlighted the fact that there was no way to get rid of a PCC unless they had committed an offence.

The saga surrounding his future further undermined confidence in the new PCC system, which had been dented first by the record low turnouts in 2012, and provoked furious calls for the law to be changed or the post to be simply abolished.

The Lib Dems have branded the coalition experiment with directly-elected commissioners a failure and pledged to scrap them. The party decided not to field a candidate in the by-election for this reason

Labour has declared it is committed to scrapping them if it wins power in 2015.

Mr Wright only resigned after weeks of pressure following the Jay Report which revealed how more than 1,400 children had been exploited by gangs of men in Rotherham.

He was the councillor who oversaw children's services in the town between 2005 and 2010.

But Labour's campaign to retain the post has been hampered by the controversy in Rotherham.

Mr Farage has insisted Ukip can build the party's recent by-election victory in Clacton and close second in Heywood and Middleton by getting its first PCC elected.

And his confidence has also been supported by strong Ukip showings in Rotherham's council elections this year and in the European elections in parts of South Yorkshire.

But Ukip only came fourth when Mr Wright was elected in 2012.

The English Democrats, came second two years ago and they believe they will still be the biggest rivals to Labour today's poll.

English Democrats chairman Robin Tilbrook said his party has a high profile in South Yorkshire in the wake of it winning the Doncaster mayoral election in 2009 and pushing Labour hard in 2012.

Four candidates have declared for the by-election: David Allen (English Democrats), Alan Billings (Labour), Jack Clarkson (Ukip), Ian Walker (Conservatives).

Mr Allen came second to Mr Wright in the 2012 election. He is a trained foundry engineer and a sales manager from Doncaster who is married with two children.

Dr Billings is a former deputy leader of Sheffield City Council and was once a parish priest in Sheffield.

Mr Clarkson is leader of the Ukip group on Sheffield City Council. He is former police inspector in the city.

Mr Walker is an engineer and a company managing director in Sheffield. He is married with four children.

The turnout in South Yorkshire in 2012 was 14.93 per cent.
