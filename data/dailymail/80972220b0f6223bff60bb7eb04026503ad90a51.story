Mario Balotelli was spared a longer ban for posting a controversial image on Instagram because of his remorse.

The FA have published the reasons for the regulatory commission's decision to hand the Liverpool striker a one-match ban and a fine of £25,000.

They noted that 'Mr Balotelli added that he deeply regretted posting the image and that he had removed it as soon as it was brought to his attention by other users that the image could cause offence.

Balotelli immediately received criticism upon uploading the post, and rejected the responses

But Balotelli wrote an apology on Twitter the day after, claiming it was meant to be 'anti-racist'

And Balotelli apologised again for the incident on Twitter as his punishment was announced

'He said that he was shocked to find the image was offensive because, out of sheer naivety, he had not understood the implication of the comments which appeared on the image.'

Roger Burden, chairman of the regulatory commission, wrote: 'We believed that the other parts of Mr Balotelli’s submissions were sincere and entirely honest.

'We also noted his prompt withdrawal of the image, his cooperation with The FA enquiry and his apology through social media.'

Balotelli missed Sunday's Premier League match with Arsenal and he must also attend an education course.

The 24-year-old ruled out an appeal after the decision was made.

He said: ‘Following the recent events related to my Super Mario post, the FA decision has made it clear that I was wrong.

‘I am sorry that my team-mates and supporters of Liverpool FC have been penalised for something I did and have now come to regret.

‘It is my intention to comply with the decision of the FA and make sure that it never happens again.’ 

The furore started when Balotelli reposted a picture of the video game character Super Mario which read: ‘Don’t be racist — be like Mario. He’s an Italian plumber created by Japanese people who speaks English and looks like a Mexican.’

Below the picture, it added: ‘Jumps like a black man and grabs coin like a Jew.’ 

Balotelli has struggled to win Liverpool fans over, scoring twice since signing for the club in August

Balotelli subsequently apologised on Twitter and insisted the image was meant to be ‘anti-racist with humour’.

His statement read: ‘I apologise if I have offended anyone… I now understand that out of context it may have the opposite effect. Not all Mexicans have moustache, not all black people jump high and not all Jewish people love money.

‘I used a cartoon done by someone else because it has Super Mario and I thought it was funny and not offensive.’
