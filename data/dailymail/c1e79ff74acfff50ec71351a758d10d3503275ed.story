The CEO of Spotify has finally responded to Taylor Swift's refusal to post any of her albums on the streaming service, revealing he is 'really frustrated' with the singer.

Daniel Ek said in an open letter that while he agrees with Swift's belief that music is art and has real value, he was upset with how her comments made it seem as if his service does not compensate artists.

He then stated that Spotify has 'paid more than $2billion to labels, publishers and collecting societies for distribution to songwriters and recording artists.'

Fighting back: Spotify CEO Daniel Ek (above) says in an open letter he is 'really frustrated' with Taylor Swift and other artists who feel his streaming service does not compensate musicians 

Shake it off: Swift (above) has refused to put any of her albums, including her latest, 1989, on Spotify

'Taylor Swift is absolutely right: music is art, art has real value, and artists deserve to be paid for it,' Ek starts off his letter.

'We started Spotify because we love music and piracy was killing it.'

Ek then points out that it is piracy that is ruining music and hurting musicians, and that no one has made any money at all from piracy, while Spotify has paid out the aforementioned $2billion to members of the music industry.

He then goes into his problem with the artists who complain about his service.

'When I hear stories about artists and songwriters who say they’ve seen little or no money from streaming and are naturally angry and frustrated, I’m really frustrated too,' he says.

'As I said, we’ve already paid more than $2 billion in royalties to the music industry and if that money is not flowing to the creative community in a timely and transparent way, that’s a big problem.'

He then breaks down some of the myths people believe to be true, like the fact that artists don't really get paid by services like Spotify.

'Unlike other free music options – from piracy to YouTube to SoundCloud – we pay artists and rights holders every time a song is played on our free service,' he explains.

He then takes on the claim that no artist could ever earn a living from their music playing on Spotify because they pay so little per play, comparing his service to radio.

'If a song has been listened to 500 thousand times on Spotify, that’s the same as it having been played once on a U.S. radio station with a moderate sized audience of 500 thousand people. Which would pay the recording artist precisely … nothing at all. But the equivalent of that one play and it’s 500 thousand listens on Spotify would pay out between three and four thousand dollars.'

Ek then shades Swift a bit by listing the artists who have successfully promoted their albums on Spotify before their release, including her pal Ed Sheeran and diva pop star Ariana Grande, and pointing out that the most pirated album in the world last week was Swift's newest release, 1989.

Despite those piracy numbers, Swift did still manage to shatter single week sales records when she moved 1.3 million copies of the album in its debut week, the most since 2002.

Wait a minute: major artists like Adele (left) and Beyonce (right) have withheld new music from the streaming service for months after its release 

Ek closes his letter by saying of Spotify, 'We’re not just streaming, we’re mainstreaming now, and that’s good for music makers and music lovers around the world.'

Swift is not the first artist to withhold music from Spotify, with big name artists including Adele and Beyonce waiting months to release their albums in full to the service.

Other artists have been more vocal about their dislike for the way the site operates, including Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke who took Spotify to task over their business model. 

Yorke wrote on Twitter, 'Make no mistake, new artists you discover on Spotify will not get paid. Meanwhile shareholders will shortly be rolling in it. Simples' 

He then added in another tweet, 'New artists get paid fu*k all with this model.'

Angry bird: Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke (left) has expressed his disdain for the service and how it does not help new artists, while investor Sean Parker (right) was called an 'a**hole" and a 'thief' by Black Keys singer Patrick Carney

Black Keys frontman Patrick Carney also voiced his disdain for the service, and one of its original investors, infamous tech entrepreneur and Napster founder Sean Parker, who he labeled an 'a**hole.'

'That guy has $2 billion that he made from figuring out ways to steal royalties from artists, and that’s the bottom line,' said Carney.

'You can’t really trust anybody like that.'
