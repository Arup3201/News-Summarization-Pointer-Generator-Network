The tension between New York police and Mayor Bill de Blasio was sky high on Friday as a plane was seen waving a message reading: 'Our backs have turned to you.'

The message, which flew above the Hudson River around 9am, was a reference to officers' reactions to de Blasio as he attended the hospital where the bodies of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were taken after they were shot on Saturday.

As the mayor walked past the officers, many were seen turning their backs to him.

A photo of the plane banner was shared by former cop John Cardillo on Twitter on Friday as family members gathered to remember Ramos at his wake and memorial service in Queens. 

Harsh words: This banner was seen flying across New York City on Friday morning. It refers to the moment police officers turned their backs on Mayor Bill de Blasio following the deaths of two cops last weekend

It is not clear who paid for the banner. Jersey Shore Aerial Advertising, which displayed the message, told the New York Daily News that the buyers wanted to stay anonymous.

But on his website, Cardillo wrote that a 'large and unified group of current and retired NYC Police Officers, Detectives, & Supervisors' had asked him to post a message after seeing the plane.

'We are outraged by the mayor's incendiary rhetoric, and for facilitating the current hostile climate towards the NYPD,' he wrote on the blog.

'It is our opinion that Mayor de Blasio's dangerous and irresponsible comments about his and his wife's concern for their son's safety at the hands of the NYPD fueled the flames that led to civil unrest, and potentially to the deaths of PO Wenjian Liu and PO Rafael Ramos, as well as the continued threats against NYPD personnel.'

The Mayor shows us no respect, and encourages the public to follow his lead.' 

The comments refer to how de Blasio revealed that he has warned his son Dante, who is mixed race, to be careful how he acts around police officers.

 He made the comments in the aftermath of the deaths of black men, including Eric Garner and Michael Brown, at the hands of white police officers. Neither of the officers involved were charged.

After a grand jury failed to indict the officer who held Garner in a chokehold, de Blasio expressed his shock. Some police officers believe he should have supported them more strongly. 

Instead, he supported protesters who police union leaders had accused of stirring up a loathing for police.

'We no longer have confidence in Mayor de Blasio, nor in his ability to lead New York City and promote the values that both the NYPD and the good law abiding citizens of the city hold dear,' Cardillo wrote. 'Mayor de Blasio turned his back on us long before we turned our backs on him.'

Also on Friday, hundreds of mourners gathered at a church to pay their
respects to officer Ramos, who was shot by a man who claimed he wanted to avenge the death of Garner. 

Crowds of uniformed police officers greeted the hearse as it drove through the streets of Glendale. An NYPD flag was draped over Ramos' casket as officers carried it inside the church.

Police officers from departments around the country were then expected to join U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and city and state officials for Ramos's funeral service on Saturday.

Police had yet to announce details for the funeral of Liu,
32, while federal officials helped some of his relatives in
China travel to the United States.

The execution-style killing was so swift, according to the
city's police commissioner, that the officers may never have
seen their assailant, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, who soon after shot
himself and died in a nearby subway station.

Brinsley wrote online before the attack that he wanted tokill a couple of police officers to avenge the deaths of EricGarner and Michael Brown, unarmed black men killed by whitepolicemen in New York and Missouri.
