From the single person on £75,000 to a couple on £17,000 with two children, this graphic lays bare how you will be affected by tax changes from April.

Chancellor George Osborne announced today that the £10,000 personal tax allowance threshold will be reached in 2014, a year ahead of schedule.

But one analyst said the Budget largely ignored individuals and warned that the gains for all groups in this graphic do not take account of inflation.

Tim Gregory, partner at Saffery Champness chartered accountants, told MailOnline: ‘Take something like “married couple with two schoolage children”.

‘If they've got gross income of £50,000, 
their gain of £113 is 0.2 per cent. Take out the inflation and they're 
worse off to the tune of about 2 per cent.’

He added: ‘There was much more done (in the Budget) at the lower level of income and it was positive. There was virtually nothing done, either positively or negatively, for those on higher income.

‘You've also got the new employment allowance allowing a £2,000 cut in national insurance for an employer who's taking on new employees.

‘I don't think there’s any particular incentive to have children, but there is more help. People are encouraged financially if they do have children.’

Mr Gregory used the graphic to compare the unmarried couple with two schoolage children and the married pensioner couple under 75.

He said: ‘You can see that the couple with the children are benefiting a lot more. The incomes are broadly similar. So that suggests additional help.’

Another graphic (right) also showed a highly-paid professional earning less than twice the other one will be gaining more than twice the other.

Mr Gregory said: ‘It's simply because the richer one is currently paying tax at 50 per cent on far more of their income than the other one.

‘So the cut to 45 per cent will benefit that person, so it's really only to be expected as a result of the tax cut coming in next month.’

Bringing forward the allowance rise to £10,000 will mean a cumulative cash benefit for typical basic rate taxpayers of £705 since the Coalition began.

From April, it will go up as planned to £9,440 - a £200 boost for 24million taxpayers. The basic and higher rates of income tax will remain the same.

It will also mean 2.7 million working age adults have been taken out of income tax altogether in the new financial year.

Mr Osborne said: ‘It's a historic achievement for this government and for hard-working families across the country.’

The Government has also stuck by its decision to reduce the top rate of tax on earnings over £150,000 from 50p to 45p next month.

Campaign group the TaxPayers' Alliance said the personal allowance increase would help to ease the burden of high living costs.
