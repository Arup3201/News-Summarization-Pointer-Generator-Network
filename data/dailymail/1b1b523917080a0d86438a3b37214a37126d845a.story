As drunken fashionista Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous, Joanna Lumley is the ultimate example of how to grow old disgracefully.

Tottering in high heels while clutching champagne with her hair in an extravagant up-do in the season's most outrageous outfits, the star's best loved character has eschewed every opportunity to act her age.

The loveable Patsy had been considered to be a fiction for the glamorous actress - until now.

Style advice: the 65-year-old AbFab stalwart claims that older women should embrace ¿mutton-dressed-as lamb¿ fashion just as her on-screen persona would.

claims that older women should embrace ‘mutton-dressed-as lamb’ fashion 
just as her on-screen persona would.

In an outspoken interview for Women and Home magazine, she said: ‘I think it’s important for women to be daring and not worry what people say... I love what people might call mutton-dressed-as-lamb shops.

'I love layering clothes, like young girls wear. I like being experimental with fashion.

'People often say you can’t have long hair over 40. B******* to that! I want long hair and I’m going to keep my long hair.’

Growing old disgracefully: Joanna Lumley as Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous

Miss Lumley added that there was ‘no reason’ women of her age could not go into Topshop.

She told Woman & Home magazine: ‘The other day I put on a pair of old Jean Muir shorts I found at the back of the wardrobe and I felt fabulous.

'Mind you, nobody said anything about how I looked – not a compliment in sight – so maybe I didn’t look that great. But, gosh, I felt fabulous.’

She stressed that she never goes to the gym and owes her figure to ‘running up and down stairs’.

But
she admits that she does not hit the bottle like champagne-swigging Patsy.

She added: ‘Sadly for women, 
booze goes straight to the face, especially white wine – it tends to 
make women’s faces puffy.’

The actress, who played Purdey in The New Avengers, also said the Queen was the woman who inspired her most, adding: ‘She is phenomenal – at the age of 80 and she’s still going to the races, she’s riding, she’s being charming to hundreds of people, she’s remembering people’s names and what they do.

'She turns out looking great. She is utterly extraordinary.’

Along with the award-winning BBC sitcom’s creator Jennifer Saunders, Miss Lumley is currently filming three new episodes of Ab Fab.
