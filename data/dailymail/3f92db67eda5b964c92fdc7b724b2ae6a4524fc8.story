Ronny Deila last night confirmed Celtic were poised to conclude a deal for Craig Gordon – as the Scottish champions brace themselves for a big-money bid for Fraser Forster.

La Liga holders Atletico Madrid have been linked with an £8million move for Forster to replace Thibaut Courtois, who has returned to Chelsea.

Southampton are also keen on the World Cup squad member and may well step up their interest after drafting England goalkeeping coach Dave Watson onto their staff.

In safe hands? Craig Gordan looks set to return to Scottish football

Deila still hopes to keep Forster at Parkhead but recognises the financial reality if an irresistible offer is forthcoming.

The capture of ex-Scotland international Gordon is not linked to Forster’s exit but would provide a hugely experienced option for a key position in the squad.

Deila is confident a deal can now be finalised for the 31-year-old, who is fit again after two years without a club following a serious knee injury.

‘We are getting closer with Craig Gordon, it is down to the small details,’ said the Norwegian. ‘I think we can make this happen but it’s not confirmed yet.

‘But we also need to have alternatives. You always make contingency plans. We have a much bigger scouting network here. In Norway it was only me, but we always have the chance to bring in good players.

‘Craig needs time. If he can get back to his old levels then he will be a very good international-class goalkeeper.

‘If you are going to bring in older players then they need to have the right mentality and Craig has that.

‘He can help the young players improve and have a good influence on the group.’

Newcastle and Southampton are both tracking Virgil van Dijk, but Deila insisted no bids had yet been tabled for the Dutch centre-back or Forster.

‘I have always been used to this kind of situation because at Stromsgodset I lost half a team every year,’ he said.

‘It’s a positive. If no one wants your players then you are doing something wrong.

‘There are always going to be rumours, but that is all they are at the moment.

‘When someone faxes Celtic with an offer then it is real and we will have to make a decision.

‘But there is nothing concrete right now and I am positive about the rest of the window as well.

‘Peter (Lawwell) doesn’t call me to tell me it’s a rumour. He will call me when there is something true and so far I’ve heard nothing.

‘I am hoping that remains the case. I want to keep these players but I know there is always the possibility the club can get good money, which can be reinvested. That’s a good way to work.’

Forster is due to join up with the Celtic squad during the second week of their Austrian training camp and could play in the friendly against Dukla Prague a week on Friday.

‘We will have Emilio Izaguirre and Fraser for the last game out here, but Efe Ambrose will meet up with us in Glasgow because of the visa problems,’ said Deila of his World Cup participants.

‘It takes time to get the papers sorted but the good thing is that Efe has played games. It’s more important for Fraser to come because he needs games.’
