A cowboy clamper who rigged a parking meter to cheat drivers out of their cash has been ordered to pay back almost £3million or face an extra ten years in jail.

Steven Ryan, 56, was jailed for two-and-a-half years for fitting a computer chip to make the machine accept £2 coins, but not register the payment.

Dozens of drivers who thought they had paid the right amount returned to find that not only had their car been towed away, they faced a £315 bill to have it released.

Fraudster: Steven Ryan, 56, has been ordered to pay back almost £3 million or face 10 years in jail after his firm conned motorists using a faulty meter at a Birmingham car park

Those who challenged Ryan’s firm, Car Clamping Securities, were met with hostility and intimidation, a court heard.

He was jailed in 2011 for conspiracy to defraud and controlling an article for fraud.

On Tuesday he returned to Birmingham 
Crown Court for a proceeds of crime hearing, where a judge ordered him 
to pay back a total of £2,837,349 – the amount of assets or cash Ryan 
was discovered to have held which he could not prove to have acquired 
legitimately.

Although the parking scam is believed 
to have netted Ryan’s firm only a four-figure sum, the Proceeds of Crime
Act allows investigators to delve into a convicted criminal’s financial
history for six years prior to the point when charges were levelled.

Parking woe: Car Clamping Securities conned motorists using a faulty meter at Roses car park in Digbeth, Birmingham

Expensive: Drivers were hit with demands for £315 to reclaim their cars

The legislation reverses the burden of
proof, meaning it is up to the criminal to prove assets are legitimate,
not the job of investigators to prove they are illegitimate.

Judge Murray Creed gave Ryan, from 
Solihull, six months to reimburse the cash or serve an additional jail 
sentence four times longer than his original term.

Some of the claims Ryan had made about
property he had bought had not been supported by bank statements, the 
court heard, which led the judge to conclude there were ‘other places’ 
where funds were being kept.

Searched: Ryan's home in Solihull was visited by police and Trading Standards officers during their investigation

Investigation: Police and Trading Standards seize a parking sign at Ryan's home

Impounded: Police andTrading Standards officers at the Car Clamping Securities lock-up in Birmingham

Seized: Police remove a clamping vehicle from Car Clamping Securities

At his 2011 trial, the court heard Car
Clamping Securities used a faulty meter at the Roses car park in 
Digbeth, on the fringe of Birmingham city centre. Drivers would leave 
their cars thinking they had paid £2.50 for a full day’s parking when in
fact the machine had registered only 50p payment for an hour’s parking.
The drivers didn’t notice the discrepancy on the ticket.

After an hour had passed Ryan’s firm 
would arrive to tow away their car – leaving motorists with a £315 bill 
to have it released.

Motorists contacted Birmingham Trading
Standards Department, which began a joint investigation with police. 
Investigators seized the parking machine and discovered the rogue 
computer chip inside. The machine’s manufacturer confirmed the machine 
had been doctored.

Since October 1 last year it has been 
an offence for private companies to clamp or tow vehicles from private 
land, following a Daily Mail campaign against rogue firms.
