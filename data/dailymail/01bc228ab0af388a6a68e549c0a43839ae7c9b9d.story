Nine batsmen with at least one Test century were packed into England’s Trent Bridge team but they could not prevent a quite pathetic collapse on Friday that exposed the depths to which a side bereft of all confidence have plummeted.

A middle session as bad as any in England’s miserable last nine months saw six wickets fall on a first Test pitch that remained a lifeless strip of dirt that any self-respecting batsman would want to dig up and carry around with them.

Only a late rally from Stuart Broad and then Joe Root saved England from total humiliation but they have much to do if they are to leave one of their most productive grounds still level in a series Alastair Cook cannot afford to lose.

There was little sign of what was to come as Gary Ballance and Sam Robson moved methodically forward while India’s bowlers toiled just as fruitlessly as England’s had done, particularly when they could not separate the last pair.

Yet, from the soporific strength of 134 for one and what seemed a certain draw, suddenly and shamefully England fell apart against an Indian team who have not won a single Test away from home in more than three years.

Yes, Matt Prior was the victim of a quite appalling piece of umpiring from Kumar Dharmasena, supposedly the ICC’s finest, and Robson may have been unlucky to be given out lbw in this Decision Review System-free Investec series.

And, yes, India’s bowlers have much more experience of the sort of sub-continental conditions gifted to them here in Nottingham rather than the alien ones they are usually confronted with outside their own country.

But an England team who have simply forgotten how to win have no excuses for failing to cope with an attack that, like Sri Lanka’s before them, should not pose the problems that Australia’s did during the horror winter.

There were no demons in this pitch and
 there should not have been anything to fear in a bowling line-up 
consisting of three seamers only just the right side of medium pace, a 
trundler and India’s second choice spinner.

Yet
 as soon as India managed to get an out of shape ball changed just after
 Robson appeared to get an inside edge onto pad when given lbw the whole
 complexion of the match and possibly the series dramatically changed.

Five more wickets crashed in an afternoon
 session where England lost six in all while scoring 74 runs after 
compiling 88 without loss during the morning. It was awful stuff that 
seemed to stun the usually supportive Trent Bridge crowd.

The keys to a stunning transformation were the replacement ball that swung much more than the original one and the sudden unexpected burst into life of the erratic but sometimes brilliant Ishant Sharma.

When Ishant is bad he is terrible but when he gets it right he can be a formidable proposition and here he began the collapse with a spell of three wickets that ripped the heart out of this vulnerable and fragile England side.

It was Ishant who had trapped Robson, 
with the help of what looked like a mistake by Bruce Oxenford, and he 
followed it up by ensuring that Ballance was denied a century and Ian 
Bell was once again cut off in his prime.

Jubilation: Sharma is elated after taking the prized wicket of Bell

Bell must be considered culpable in England’s demise. It was his strangled dismissal at Headingley that sparked Sri Lanka into life and now he found a way of getting out just when he seemed poised for a big and vital contribution.

England desperately need their senior players to stand up and be counted while the many promising newcomers adapt to their surroundings yet Bell fell just as disappointingly as his captain had on Thursday when he tried to withdraw his bat and got the faintest of edges through to MS Dhoni.

Worse, much worse, was to come for England as India warmed to their task, pitched the ball up to batsmen who prefer the back foot and used the short ball sparingly and hugely effectively, notably when Moeen Ali gloved to slip.

Oh no! Ballance cannot believe it as he is dismissed for 71

Halfway there: Ballance raises his bat to salute reaching 50

Prior was the man who would either come to the rescue or take the game away from opponents during England’s glory years but he was denied the chance to do so here by an unforgivable error by umpire Dharmasena.

Dhoni, who captained his side brilliantly, stood up to Bhuvneshwar Kumar and appealed loudly when a noise accompanied Prior’s play and miss to earn the decision from Dharmasena. Yet Prior's bat was fully six inches away from the ball and the sound was him clipping his pad.

It is India who arrogantly refuse to use the DRS and it cost them on the second day when Murali Vijay was wrongly given lbw by Oxenford. Yet now it was to favour them outrageously as Dharmasena raised his finger and seriously weaken the arguments of those of us who regret the advance of technology in officiating.

There was no doubt that Ben Stokes 
touched it two balls later – Dhoni was by now standing back again – and 
from nowhere England were 202 for seven and in serious danger of being 
asked to follow on by a rampaging India.

That
 they avoided that possibility was down to a bristling Broad, who hit 47
 off 42 balls, and then the second productive last wicket partnership of
 the match that stands at an unbroken 54 even though Jimmy Anderson was 
struck a nasty blow on his hand.

Root,
 who started tentatively but grew into the challenge, remains on 78 and 
is the only one of England’s nine Test centurions who can be absolved of
 blame.

Yet England are 
still 105 behind and it now looks certain that this will be their ninth 
successive Test without a win. And that is an unacceptable sequence.
