Fung Dang was left with a bitter taste in her mouth when she received a receipt calling her 'stupid' at Three Williams cafe in Redfern

A Sydney cafe owner is giving away free coffee to all customers after one of his waiters called a patron 'stupid' on a receipt.

Glen Bowditch, who owns Three Williams in inner-city Redfern, said he was 'gutted' and that the incident had the potential to destroy his business

Customer Fung Dang was left with a bitter taste in her mouth when she received the bill at the end of her meal on Sunday and found 'for the stupid customers' itemised on her receipt.

'Three Williams cafe think their customers are STUPID!' she wrote on Facebook.

'If you are interested in having breakfast and waitresses talking behind your back, then this is the perfect place to kick start your day!

'If it wasn't for your "STUPID CUSTOMERS" your business wouldn't be flourishing!'

Mr Bowditch said the waiter Charles Oehlrich had been fired and added the cafe was offering all customers free coffee today to make up for the incident.

'We're doing that on the basis of making our regular customers more aware of the situation and the fact that we don't operate like that,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'A one-off incident and somebody who works one shift a week has the power to put down a business and shut down a business at the end of the day.

'It's one silly comment one person wrote and the owners have no control over.'

Mr Bowditch said he felt sorry of everyone involved.

'This is my business, I've got money on the line,' he said.

'A million dollar caf√© could be shut at any moment.'

The waiter Charles Oehlrich said he wrote the comments on the bill because he was angry the customers had made a mistake on their order and sent their food back to the kitchen.

'I was pissed off. Those things happen in kitchens, you say stupid stuff at times and for some reason I put it on the bill,' Mr Oehlrich told The Daily Telegraph.

'I take full responsibility. I'm the one that deserves to be fired and so I have been.'

Ms Dang said she did not get her order wrong and simply asked for extra scrambled eggs.

Three Williams replied to Ms Dang's review on Facebook and gave their 'sincerest apologies'.

'This is unacceptable. The person in question has been dealt with,' they said.

'We pride ourself on great service and this is as shocking to us as it was to you.'

The cafe then offered Ms Dang a $100 voucher to make amends.
