Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will start the Italian Grand Prix on the front row of the grid, the Briton on pole, the German alongside him.

Within a few gear-flicking seconds, the road will narrow at the Variante del Rettifilo and the two of them will try to thread their silver Mercedes over the corner’s kerbs in the shortest and fastest way.

Both hope to reach the next corner, the flat-out Curva Biassano. But there are no guarantees that they will reach there and none they will leave.

In front of up to 100,000 fans in this crumpled cathedral of Italian motor racing at the centre of the tree-strewn Royal Park, the latest unmissable instalment of the 2014 world championship will unfold.

Most of those here with their banners are disciples of Ferrari, the team that Enzo built into an icon of a nation, but, with the shiny scarlet cars off the pace, it is the tussle between a cerebral German and an instinctive Briton that promises to provide the greatest excitement of the afternoon.

The backdrop to the race was provided a fortnight ago at Spa, where Hamilton and Rosberg collided on the second lap. Hamilton ultimately retired from the race. Rosberg, the aggressor, survived a broken front wing to come second and increase his advantage in the championship to 29 points.

Race: Mercedes say that their drivers can to battle it out between them free from team orders

The row afterwards was even more feisty. It ended up with Rosberg being fined by Mercedes and apologising to his team, his rival and seemingly the whole world. Both were warned to keep it clean, though management will permit them to race free of team orders.

So after Hamilton yesterday claimed his first pole since the Spanish Grand Prix on May 10, the question was how they would race in the first few frantic moments today along the fastest lap in Formula One.

Would the keep-it-clean instruction be in their minds? ‘It won’t be ringing in ‘my’ ears,’ said Hamilton. Sitting next to him, Rosberg said: ‘It’s a question I am not able to answer. The message is that we keep on racing. Every situation is different.’ 

Tense: The relationship between the two drivers has broken down since the Belgian Grans Prix

Hamilton was strangely underwhelmed in the post-qualifying press conference. ‘It is a great feeling to be up here,’ he said, with the enthusiasm of a dental patient mid-filling rather than somebody who had interrupted Rosberg’s run of six poles in seven races.

Mercedes’ outright pace suggests they should be too strong to be challenged, yet mechanical glitches have hindered them more regularly than expected.

‘Every race is important,’ said Hamilton. ‘But time is running out. I need those points.’

All the top six — Hamilton, Rosberg, Valtteri Bottas in third, his Williams team-mate Felipe Massa and the McLaren pair of Kevin Magnussen and Jenson Button — are powered by Mercedes engines.

Mercedes: The German team are unlikely to be troubled in Italy, unless they suffer more mechanical problems

To the disgruntlement of the Italian fans, Fernando Alonso starts in seventh place while the second Ferrari of Kimi Raikonnen was only 12th fastest.

Ferrari’s recent dismal run of form led the Monza rumour-mill to suggest that Luca di Montezemolo, the 67-year-old team president, might stand down after more than 40 years with the company. But with a sweep of his hair, he dismissed tales of his demise. ‘I told the board in March that I was ready to accept three more years for my shareholders and particularly for my people, the women and men of the Ferrari,’ he said.

Living up to his theatrical billing, Di Montezemolo enveloped Alonso in a long, lingering, listing hug.

Another hugger was Hamilton, embracing his dad on the way to the car. There is at least some love here among the enmity.
