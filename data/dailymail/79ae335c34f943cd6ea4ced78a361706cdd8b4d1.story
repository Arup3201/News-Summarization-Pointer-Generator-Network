A woman has been arrested after dangling her baby over a 12ft balcony and posting a photo of it on Instagram.

Aisha Jean Clark, who posted the shocking picture to her account under the handle 'RatMove13', is facing child neglect charges after her friends spotted it and called the police.

When officers arrived at her apartment in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday, the 25-year-old allegedly laughed in their faces and told them she could do what she wanted with her baby.

She then went inside
the flat, on Nuccio Parkway, to get her iPad, pulled up her Instagram account and 
showed off the picture to the officers, according to Bay News 9.

The shocking photo appears to show Clark holding her son by his right arm over a railing.

'I was mad and I was making a point. I can do what I
want with my baby. Nobody can stop me,' Clark told police as she was arrested.

When asked why she took the photo, she said: 'I don't care, you get out of my face.'

Her neighbour and long-time friend - who wishes to remain unnamed - has claimed that Clark made a mistake.

'She
just made a mistake, man. She didn't know 
it was going to get her in trouble like this,' said the man, who often lets Clark look after his two young children.

He added that Clark's friends who saw the photo on Instagram and then 
called police had blown the situation out of proportion.

A criminal report has concluded that Clark's act of dangling her baby from a second storey balcony could have led to serious physical injury or even death.
