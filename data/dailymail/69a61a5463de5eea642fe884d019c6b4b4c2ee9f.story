Almost everything you could wish for from a new sitcom is crammed into Family Tree (BBC2).

It’s co-written by Christopher Guest, who pioneered comedy mock-umentaries with This Is Spinal Tap, hailed by many film-lovers as the funniest movie ever made.

Co-produced by the U.S. cable channel HBO (home of The Sopranos), Family Tree features a zany cast of characters, a coherent storyline and, in Chris O’Dowd, a rising Hollywood star in the main role.

This surgically engineered sitcom made just one slip in its pilot episode. It forgot to leave room for the jokes.

The script is mainly improvised, in the style of Outnumbered or the American comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm. But in the flurry of expositions and introductions last night, laying out the plotlines, the actors had no time to make us laugh.

A sizeable slice of the episode was devoted to explaining why O’Dowd — born in the Emerald Isle — has a rural Irish accent when his sister, father and best mate were all  patently Londoners.

Instead of boring us with a laboured story of the character’s single-parent upbringing in Ireland, Guest should have shrugged off the anomaly and left us to invent our own explanations.

In an interview to promote the show, he was much wittier. Announcing that he was ‘delighted to welcome myself to BBC Television’, Guest added that ‘Chris O’Dowd has been on my radar since he was a child actor in Wales’.

It’s always a worry when the  publicity material is funnier than the show itself.

Family Tree does have potential. Ventriloquist Nina Conti, as the hero’s sister Bea, is obsessed with a glove puppet called Monkey, who delivers a tart commentary on the other characters.

Their father, Keith, has remarried, to an East European peasant called Luba. Keith is obsessed with forgotten Seventies sitcoms, with titles like There Goes The Neighbourhood, which Guest carefully invents and shoots, so that clips can be dropped into the show.

That’s a painstaking approach to comedy which isn’t actually funny. A bit like this whole show, in fact.

Painstaking is an inadequate word to describe the care that went into designing Princess Diana’s wardrobe. She expressed her whole life through the medium of her clothes.

Princess Diana’s Dresses: The Auction 
(C4) was a brilliant way to retell her biography. Taking ten dresses 
recently put up for sale with a guide price of £1 million, this 
absorbing documentary followed her evolution from gauche, 19-year-old 
nanny to landmine campaigner and people’s princess.

Famous: In Channel 4's Princess Diana's Dresses: The Auction, there was the dress from that night at the White House in 1985 when Diana danced with John Travolta

It revealed the fascinating story behind that frumpy blue suit she wore for her engagement photos and the notorious interview where her fiance, Charles, harrumphed about ‘whatever “in love” means’.

Announcing herself simply as Diana Spencer, she had paid a call in her Marks & Sparks daywear to leading designer David Sassoon, whose formidable shop assistant had taken one look and sent her packing. ‘If you must have something special,’ the dragon snarled, ‘go to Harrods!’

So Diana did, and the result was an outfit that was more Mrs Thatcher than fairytale princess.

Just as intriguing was the tale of the little black dress that, weeks later, announced her to the world as a fashion icon. ‘Diana the  Dazzler’ gasped the tabloids, as she was photographed with her cleavage spilling out of the low-cut cups, designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel.

Diana’s image-maker was Anna Harvey of Vogue. ‘If Elizabeth Emanuel will forgive me, that dress may not have fitted perfectly,’ sniffed Harvey. ‘Nobody allowed that to happen a second time.’

There was the dress, too, from that night at the White House when Diana danced with John Travolta. But who remembers that she also waltzed with Clint Eastwood, Tom Selleck and Neil Diamond?

As one acid-tongued politico commented, no one even noticed that President Ronald Reagan was there . . . or Prince Charles.

Charles showed a flash of his nasty side at the next day’s press conference. Asked if his wife had enjoyed the ball, he seethed: ‘I’m not a glove puppet! She’d be an idiot if she didn’t enjoy dancing with John Travolta.’

Who would have thought a few yards of taffeta, silk and satin could reveal so much?
