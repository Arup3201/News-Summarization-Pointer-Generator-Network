A son stabbed his own 86-year-old mother to death then hanged himself, writing that he was unable to 'cope with life anymore', an inquest heard.

Stephen Dohoney, 55, killed Ethel Dohoney in the home they shared after wrongly concluding that he had cancer, and that his mother would not be able to survive without his care.

Investigators called to the scene of the murder in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester last November found a note Dohoney had written explained why he 'sent her to heaven'.

Family: Stephen Dohoney, right, stabbed his mother Ethel in the neck and chest before hanging himself

They found three family photographs lying 
beside the old lady’s body - one her late husband Jack, a second of her 
late son Kenneth and a third of herself as a younger woman.

An inquest in Manchester today heard how Dohoney, a civil servant at the Department for Work and Pensions, was terrified of succumbing to cancer, which had also killed his older brother.

However, he did not have any form of the disease, nor was there any medical evidence to suggest he did.

After inflicting the stab wounds on his mother, who was also known as Olwyn, Dohoney left a suicide note signed ‘Stephen D’ which read: 'I can’t cope with life anymore. I’m going to have another breakdown.

'Mum would not have survived without me and would have said it was her fault so I have sent her to heaven. We have lived together all our lives so we should die together.'

The coroner heard that Dohoney who had two degrees from Exeter University, had been a keen traveller who 'lived life to the full' and loved reading, films and going to the theatre.

But he had taken extended leave from his job to care full-time for his mother, whose physical and mental health had 'rapidly deteriorated' following the death of her oldest son Kenneth from cancer in 2012 aged 62.

The death had rocked the family and led Dohoney to worry about the disease. He visited his GP but the doctor had diagnosed the disease sarcoidosis, where tissue on the organs becomes swollen.

Kenneth Dohoney's widow Christine said Mrs Dohoney, a former shorthand typist, sandwich-maker and cleaner had struggled since her son's death in September 2012 from leukaemia.

Scene: Investigators were called to the house in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, which Dohoney shared with his mother

'She thought that she should have died instead of him,' she said in a statement.

'Her health deteriorated and she became dependent on Stephen. She stopped going out on her own and spent more time at home. They had never been apart except from when Stephen was at university.

'When Kenneth died Stephen took it upon himself to take a career break to look after her. Kenneth’s death hit them both hard.

'She deteriorated both physically and mentally. He was also increasingly worried about his own health. From May of 2013 he was frightened he had cancer like Kenneth.'

The murder scene was discovered by a friend of Christine Dohoney, who checked on the house after she returned from holiday.

Mrs Dohoney snr was found in bed with multiple stab wounds to her neck and chest. Dohoney had surrounded himself with documents explaining the family's financial circumstances before killing himself.

Detective Inspector Richard Eales of Greater Manchester Police said: 'In the weeks before his death he became very concerned about his weight and was weighing himself every day.

'He was diagnosed with sarcoidosis and had high blood pressure and was on a number of medications.”

Recording verdicts of unlawful killing and suicide, coroner Nigel Meadows said of Mrs Dohoney: 'She was a very elderly lady with impaired physical and mental health that had been stabbed a number of times in the chest.

'The weapon used was discovered below Stephen. If there is no evidence of anybody else being involved - it can only be Stephen who killed his mother.

'Officially I have got to record that Ethel was unlawfully killed because she was murdered. Stephen took his own life and I can be satisfied that he killed himself and killed his mother.

'He might have been struggling with his mental health and had become preoccupied with his own health.

'He at some point described he had cancer but he didn’t and as far as I could tell from records he was investigated and no-one was telling him he had cancer.

'I suspect he did have some form of mental health problem. Obviously that does not give him any right to try and harm anyone else, particularly his mother. He may have been doing so for in his mind trying to do the best he could for his mum but that is unlawful.'
