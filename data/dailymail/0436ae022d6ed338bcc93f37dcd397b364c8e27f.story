Hull defender James Chester is facing an indefinite spell on the sidelines after dislocating his shoulder against West Ham on Sunday afternoon.

The 25-year-old was forced off for the Tigers in first-half stoppage time, after falling awkwardly on his right shoulder when Hammers defender James Collins beat him to a challenge in the air.

Chester, who now requires surgery, looked in some discomfort as he left the field of play, with his shirt fashioned into a sling.

After the game Hull boss Steve Bruce confirmed the news saying: 'Unfortunately Chester has dislocated his shoulder, we are awaiting x rays.

'It adds to the list of injuries which is unfortunate for us at the minute.'

The former Manchester United defender is now the 10th Hull player currently sidelined.

The problems continue to mount for Hull boss Steve Bruce after Hull's latest injury setback

Arsenal full-back Mathieu Debuchy suffered a similar injury to Chester when he crashed into the advertising hoardings against Stoke last weekend, consequently being ruled out for three months as a result. 

Results on the field for Bruce's side aren't any better after goals from Andy Carroll, Morgan Amalfitano and Stewart Downing condemned the Tigers to defeat at Upton Park, meaning they remain in the relegation zone - a point from safety.
