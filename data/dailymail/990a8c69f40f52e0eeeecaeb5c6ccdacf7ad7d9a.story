England's squad took time out of their training regime in Portugal on Wednesday with a round of golf as preparations for the World Cup took to the course.

Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and the other Three Lions squad members were at Vale do Lobo resort for what should have been warm weather training to get used to the conditions in Brazil.

The climate was more like a British winter, however, with players having to wear extra layers of clothing to mimic the feeling of South America.

Sports scientists from Loughborough University have flown out to take samples of the playersâ€™ sweat as they prepare for the humid conditions of Manaus, where England play Italy on June 14 in their first Group D game.

But certain members of the squad are in exceptionally high spirits, especially the two goalkeepers looking to push Joe Hart for a place as No 1.

As Fraser Forster went to drive from the tee, the golf ball exploded, as did Ben Foster in laughter, and the West Brom stopper had it all on camera.
