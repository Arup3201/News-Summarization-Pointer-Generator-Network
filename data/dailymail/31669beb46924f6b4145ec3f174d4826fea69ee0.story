Newcastle United defender Steven Taylor has been ruled out for the rest of the season as he requires surgery on his ruptured achilles tendon.

The 28-year-old had to be replaced in the 60th minute against Burnley on New Year's Day after sustaining the injury.

Caretaker manager John Carver said he feared the worst after his side's 3-3 Barclays Premier League draw at St James' Park and his initial assessment has come to fruition.

Taylor has revealed he is due to have an operation next Wednesday and confirmed he will be out of action for the remainder of the season.

He wrote on Sportlobster: 'Gutted to say I'm going to be out for the season. I ruptured my achilles in the last game. 

'Thankfully it wasn't the one I did a few years ago. I'll have an operation on it on Wednesday but won't make it back now for the rest of this season. 

'I know what to do in the rehab from last time and will come back fitter and stronger than before.'

Carver said after his first game in temporary charge of Newcastle following Alan Pardew's move to Crystal Palace: 'Unfortunately, we have lost Steven Taylor. It looks like he has ruptured his achilles tendon - and it's not the one he did previously, so I think that's the end of him now for the season.

'I have known Steven since he was in the Centre of Excellence and he is a great lad. It was great for him to get the goal at a set-play, it was set up for him.

'But when he landed, you could tell the way he landed it was something to do with the calf or achilles and unfortunately it's not looking good.'
