Samir Nasri was mystifyingly left out of France’s World Cup squad and his girlfriend, Anara Atanes, tweeted her displeasure.

A series of expletive-driven messages included the opinion that Didier Deschamps, the national coach, was s***. Deschamps is now taking Atanes to court and has issued a civil lawsuit.

This seems a spectacular over-reaction. Atanes is a Victoria’s Secret model and member of a minor pop group called Fanfare. She is not greatly sought after for her views on the game.

Apology: The model said she hadn't intended to offend French people, only the football management

Retiring? Nasri is considering his international future after being left out of the squad

Quite why Deschamps, a World Cup and European Championship- winning captain with France, cares what she thinks is perplexing.

Patrick Vieira, a colleague of  Nasri’s at Manchester City, says French football has forgotten how to handle strong personalities.

It’s worse than that. They can’t even handle their girlfriends.

Discontent: Brighton-born Atanes has used her Twitter account to criticise France and post pictures of herself

Decision: Deschamps says he left Nasri at home because he would not be content to sit on the bench

Under-fire: Deschamps has been attacked by former players and pundits for his decision on Nasri

Delight: Atanes and Nasri were celebrating just a few days ago when City clinched the title

Success: Nasri has been a crucial part of City's title winning team this season

Back to basics: Nasri trained with his City team-mates on their post-season trip to Abu Dhabi

Popular: The Frenchman took part in a signing session for fans with team-mates Jovetic and Nastasic
