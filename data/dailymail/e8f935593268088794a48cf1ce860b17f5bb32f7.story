Seeking freedom: Daniel Villegas, 35, has spent the last 18 years in prison after being convicted of killing two men

A Texas man who has spent nearly two decades in prison after admitting to killing two men in a drive-by shooting when he was 16 year old is now asking for a new trial, and he may yet get a chance at freedom. 

Villegas, who is now 35, continues to insist that the confession that led to his conviction, and which he has since recanted, was obtained by coercion.

A private investigator hired by his supporters, a team from Northwestern University Law School's Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth and a pair of men exonerated after serving time for murder have backed up his claims of innocence 

Most importantly, Jesse Hernandez, who survived the 1993 shooting, said that Villegas is not the killer.

‘I believe with all my heart he is innocent,’ Hernandez told FoxNews.com. ‘I always thought I knew who else might have done it from the beginning. I had never heard of Daniel before.’

Villegas’ defense team filed a writ of habeas corpus, citing ineffective assistance of counsel and actual innocence as their reasons for retrial.

The 35-year-old convict will learn his fate on Thursday when Texas 409th District Court Judge Sam Medrano is expected to rule on whether to grant him one last chance to prove his innocence in what will be his third murder trial.

‘I'm going to delve into this,’ Medrano told El Paso Times. ‘I'm going to start working on the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. When I believe that I may be ready to make my decision I will notify the parties.’ 

The evidence the defense submitted includes 13 discs containing the full length conversations Villegas had with family and friends while at the El Paso County Jail.

Bad reputation: Villegas was a 16-year-old high school dropout with ties to a gang when he signed a confession admitting to the murders

Grave allegations: Villegas has claimed that a detective obtained his confession by force after hitting and threatening him

Prosecutors objected to the discs with more than 400 phone conversations being admitted, dismissing them as irrelevant to the case.

For Villegas, the chain of events that landed him behind bars goes back to 1993 when four men, including Hernandez, Juan Carlos Medina and murder victims Armando ‘Mando’ Lazo, 18, and Robert England, 17, were walking along Electric Avenue in El Paso, Texas.

A car with three people inside pulled up, and one passenger demanded ‘Que Barrio?’ – a slang term which means ‘what gang are you with?’ In response, two of the men ran away, and two others were shot dead in a vacant lot.

England suffered a single gunshot wound to the head and died on scene. Lazo was shot once in the abdomen and once in the thigh. His body was found outside a nearby home where he had desperately tried to seek help.

Soon after, police investigating the murders focused on Villegas as a suspect. The 16-year-old boy was a high school dropout and a known gang member who had a reputation for telling tall tales in an effort to boost his street cred.

Crime scene: Villegas was arrested in 1993 after two men were gunned down in El Paso in what appears to be a gang-related shooting

The teen was arrested in connection with the deadly shootings, and just hours later police got a confession penned in a third-grade level of writing. In the document, Villegas noted that a detective offered him a Coke, and he apologized to the families of the victims.

According to Villegas’ team, then-detective Al Marquez used physical violence and threatened the frightened teen into signing the confession, which proved crucial during the trial since investigators had no evidence linking the 16-year-old to the scene of the crime.

'I'm not a saint, but even thought I'm not, you know, I'm not a killer either,' Villegas said in an interview with News Channel 9 last November.

The story of a forced confession rang true for Hernandez, who was also questioned following the murders.

‘They tried to do that to me, but I kind of put things together,’ he told Fox News. ‘They pushed him. They had other leads but they just dropped the ball and wanted the easy way out.’

Team effort: Villegas' supporters claim that he had inadequate legal representation during his trial and is innocent

Villegas’ first trial ended in hung jury, but in a second trial that took place in 1995, the panel came back with a guilty verdict, and he was sentenced to life in prison.

Freddie Bonilla, the private detective who was hired by Villegas’ distant relative, has revealed that court-appointed attorney John Gates failed in his duties as a counselor, spending only 40 hours preparing for his client’s murder trial.

Gates even signed an affidavit admitting that he had not done his best to argue Villegas' case.

Joshua Tepfer, project director at the Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth, told FoxNews.com evidence shows the murders were committed by brothers Rudy and Javier Flores, who allegedly told a witness Villegas was in jail for a crime they did.

Family support: Villegas' parents have been fighting to get a retrial for their son where he would have a chance to prove his innocence

Javier Flores has since died and his surviving sibling is currently serving jail time on drug-related charges.

However, El Paso Assistant District Attorney John Briggs said the jury in the second trial reached the correct verdict and dismissed Villegas' claims of ineffective counsel.

‘He has provided no new evidence, which is required for someone who is claiming actual innocence,’ Briggs said.
