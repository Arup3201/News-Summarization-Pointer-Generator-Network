A 22-year-old college student has been found dead of what appears to be a violent beating in the backyard of a New Jersey home.

Backyard death: Student William McCaw was found dead in a New Jersey backyard by police

William McCaw, from Tennessee, was pronounced dead at the New Brunswick home at 10:45am Saturday

Middlesex County prosecutors say a preliminary investigation indicates that McCaw died of blunt force trauma, believed to be the result of a violent beating.

According to investigators, McCaw had no connections to the residents of the home where he was found.

The house is inhabited by Rutgers students who are 'normal,' according to neighbors.

No arrests have been made in the case.

Results from an autopsy are pending.

The Kean University Police Director Adam Shubsda confirmed that McCaw was a student there.

'The entire Kean community extends our condolences to the family and friends of William McCaw,' he told NJ.com.

According to his Facebook account, McCaw was a sales rep at GetyourGreek.com and interned at the Bank of New York Mellon.

Graham Lewis, a Rutgers student and a friend of McCaw, told NJ.com he was 'the kindest and nicest person in the world.'

'He would never hurt a soul and was always smiling,' Lewis said in an email. 'He loved Rutgers more than he loved his own friends sometimes.'
