An eight-year-old girl was mauled to death by a circus tiger after it pulled her into its enclosure at an amusement park in China.

Juan Niu was killed after sneaking away from her family to get a closer look at the tigers in a circus, and being pulled into their cage and mauled.

The youngster was visiting relatives in China's south-western Chongqing Municipality with her family when they decided to visit a local amusement park after seeing posters for their new circus attraction.

Leheledu Amusement Park managers had hired a travelling circus to entertain visitors and had set up temporary holding pens for the animals.

She had easily walked up to the cage and managed to slip through the bars, at which point she was pounced upon by a tiger and mauled in front of horrified park visitors.

Although animal trainers were quickly at the scene and pulled the child free of the animal, she was barely alive and was declared dead on arrival at a nearby hospital.

The incident last week did not initially make the news after park managers offered the family compensation and promised to increase security around the animals.

However, after rumours started circulating the park was forced to admit the tragedy had happened.

Spokesman Manchu Hung said: 'Nothing terrible like this has ever happened before and we take the safety of our visitors very seriously. 

'We will pay all compensation necessary to the family and will make sure it's not possible for anything similar to ever happen again.'  

A park spokesman said safety measures would be improved to prevent another incident. Pictured, the circus 

A Shanghai Zoo keeper was mauled to death by this rare South China tiger last year after entering its enclosure, pictured, to clean

Last month, a nine-year-old boy had his arm torn off by a bear at a zoo in China's Henan province after he jumped past the guard rail and reached inside the cage to feed the animal.

In December last year, a keeper at Shanghai zoo was mauled to death by a tiger after he entered its enclosure to clean it. 

Colleagues of the 56-year-old man said he went into the nine-year-old male south China tiger's enclosure and 'did not come out again'.
