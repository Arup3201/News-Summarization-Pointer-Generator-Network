At just 6ft wide, and sandwiched between two terraces, it his hardly an imposing structure.

But London's narrowest house is set to be torn down after its owner lost a legal challenge against the local council.

A planning inspector ruled that the property - in Leyton, east London - looked 'singularly out of place' and was 'wholly unsatisfactory'.

He has now given the owners three months to remove it.

The narrowest house in London - just 6ft wide, sandwiched between two terraces - is to be torn down after its owner lost a legal challenge

Building work on the wooden property began in May last year.

Neighbours at the time said they were 'very concerned' for the safety of people living in the home.

Waltham Forest Council soon ordered the building work to stop on site, which used to be a garage, as planning permission had not been granted.

The authority later ordered the structure to be torn down, but the owner Zim Properties in Leyton, appealed against the decision and the matter was handed to the Planning Inspectorate.

But the appeal was dismissed and the owner has been given three months to tear it down or face further action.

Planning Inspector Ian Currie ordered Zim Properties to pay the council’s legal costs after deciding the appeal was unreasonable.

In his ruling, he said it was not of a 'high standard of design', as required by Policy DM30.

He added: 'It is much narrower than the terrace houses it adjoins, giving it a pinched appearance, it finished in wood rather than brick and it has flat roof, unlike its neighbours with their pitched roofs.

The wooden structure is built on the site of a former garage which was attached to number 105, but does not have planning permission

'Overall, it looks singularly out of place, in an area that has maintained its late nineteenth/early twentieth century character remarkably intact, and I conclude that the design of the structure is wholly unsatisfactory.'

Waltham Forest Council is set to serve an enforcement notice to tear down an illegal building built between two terraced homes.

Work started on the plywood abode in Leyton, about a month ago, and it has quickly divided neighbours, some of whom welcome the home while others fear it will create overcrowding.

The wooden structure is built on the site of a former garage which was attached to number 105, but does not have planning permission.

The council was not immediately sure whether it had broken planning regulations, but a spokesman said the authority will serve a notice to pull down the structure 'as soon as possible', after serving a temporary notice to prevent building continuing over the weekend.

Last May the council served a temporary notice to prevent further building work.

At the time, cabinet member for the environment Clyde Loakes said: 'As soon as this issue came to the attention of the council, officers visited the site in the company of the owner. In order to prevent any further unauthorised development a Temporary Stop Notice was served.

'Arrangements have been made for council staff to monitor the site over the long weekend and the neighbours directly affected by the development have been asked to contact the council should any further works take place.'

Neighbours said no tenants have been found for the property, which is still under construction, and do not know the owner of the garage or the name of the building company working on it.

Nearby resident Claire Weiss, 65, said she has complained to the council about the building.

She said: 'I feel sorry for whoever will live there. People shouldn’t have to live in a space like that, even with the housing crisis.

'Passing by I’ve seen inside when the doors open and you can see right through to the back garden. There’s no dividing wall. It’s a garage with a loft.

'It’s dreadful and it doesn’t fit in at all with the other houses.'

There are 24,000 people on the council’s housing waiting list and, as of March, just 60 empty homes in the borough, many of which have been allocated already.

The council is trying to free up space for housing developments by targeting disused garages.

It has found 159 sites around the borough, and the strategy is expected to create hundreds of homes.

Des Douglas, 64, who lives opposite the development, said: 'It’s a bit rough but other than that it doesn’t bother me. It hasn’t been used for years as a garage so why not?

'There’s a shortage of housing so everything helps.'
