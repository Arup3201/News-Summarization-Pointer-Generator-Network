He earns millions a year from his consultancy roles and charges fees of £250,000 for public speaking – but Tony Blair insists he is not motivated by money.

And he dismissed reports he has amassed £100million since leaving office as ‘greatly exaggerated’.

In a rare comment on his personal finances, Mr Blair suggested he was worth less than £20million, despite the family owning property worth at least £30million.

Tony Blair today denied being worth £100million, insisting the true value was around a fifth of that figure

The former Prime Minister used a speech to the to the Progress centre-left think-tank in London to mark 20 years since he was elected Labour leader

Responding to a question about his 
lucrative earnings, Mr Blair, who was marking the 20th anniversary of 
becoming Labour leader, joked that his wife kept demanding to know where
 his reported money is.

And he insisted that he is still motivated by the same ‘values’ as he was when he became Labour leader in 1997.

‘Today
 my work is global,’ he told an audience of admirers from the Blairite 
group Progress. ‘But what gets me up in the morning is the same.’

He
 added: ‘I haven’t changed, despite people wanting to say that I have 
changed. The same thing that motivated me when I stood here as Labour 20
 years ago motivates me today – it’s not about making money, it’s about 
making a difference.’

Mr Blair joked that his wife Cherie had been asking where his reported £100million wealth was hidden

Speaking
 about reports of his fortune, Mr Blair added: ‘In respect to my new 
life, first of all, I have to say that reports of my wealth are greatly 
exaggerated. Just for the record, I read I’m supposed to be worth 
£100million – Cherie’s kind of asking where it is. I’m not worth that, 
half of that, a third of that, a quarter of that, a fifth of that … I 
could go on.’

He said he 
spends two-thirds of his time on his unpaid role as a Middle East ‘peace
 envoy’ and his charitable foundations, which focus on Africa and faith 
issues.

‘I also employ today over 200 people,’ he added.

He
 was cheered by an audience that included many old friends and former 
Cabinet colleagues including Peter Mandelson, Tessa Jowell and Lord 
Adonis.

Mr Blair also raised a laugh when he was asked about comments 
from Boris Johnson, who suggested he needed psychiatric treatment after 
saying the West should bomb Syria and Iraq.

Labour leader Ed Miliband was warned not to allow his party to be run by social media and pressure groups.

Tony Blair said he had to show conviction himself, and not be buffeted by people who 'shout the loudest'.

He warned against lurching to the left in response to calls from people who do represent the public mood. 

Mr Blair said: 'We should, of course, listen to the interests associated with us, and the assortment of pressure groups banging on our door but never conflate their noise, which with social media can seem deafening, with public opinion or let them decide policy. 

'Those who shout the loudest don't necessarily deserve to be heard the most.'

Mr
 Blair responded: ‘It is a little disconcerting to be described as mad 
by Boris Johnson – relatively speaking it is not a high bar.’

Mr
 Blair rarely talks about his personal finances, but analysis suggests 
he was being unduly modest about his own good fortune. His property 
empire alone is worth at least £30million.

His
 five-storey central London home, and its accompanying mews house is 
thought to be worth at least £8million, while his Grade I-listed manor 
house in Buckinghamshire, which was once owned by Sir John Gielgud, is 
thought to be worth a similar amount.

He and Mrs Blair also own another seven properties.

Since
 leaving office in 2007, Mr Blair has set up a complex web of companies,
 which make it impossible to calculate his exact earnings.

However, the 
two that cover his consultancy work have declared cash reserves of 
£13.4million and shareholder funds worth £7million, according to the 
most recent accounts.

He has
 also carved out a role as a global consultant to corporations and 
foreign regimes, which is thought to bring him millions a year. And he 
can command up to £250,000 for speeches to private sector audiences.

He
 is an adviser to US investment bank JP Morgan, where he was paid a 
reported £2million a year when he joined in 2008, and to Swiss insurer 
Zurich International, for which he is thought to earn at least 
£1million.

█ Mr Blair faced 
embarrassment yesterday when he was cornered by Channel Four News 
reporter Michael Crick, who demanded  to know why he was not in Gaza 
trying to end the crisis there. 

He ignored questions for more than a 
minute after becoming stuck in a lift.
