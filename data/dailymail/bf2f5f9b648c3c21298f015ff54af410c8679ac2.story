The Instagram account of the Icelandic Police Force in Reykjavik has become an online hit.

Iceland has one of the lowest crime rates in the world, so as well as uphold law and order, the Reykjavik police has time to serve their community in other ways.

The account shows snaps of police officers teaching young children how to behave in traffic, find lost dogs, eat ice cream and take part in the local Pride parade.  

Crimes? What crimes? The Instagram account of the Icelandic Police Force in Reykjavik show pretty much everything but the officers hunting criminals

The crime rate is extremely low in Iceland compare to the rest of the world - police only shot dead the first person in the country's history in 2013.

The man had fired a shotgun at unarmed police, hitting one on the helmet, but the officers still apologised to the gunman's family after the deadly intervention.

A 2011 UN study found that Iceland's homicide rate between 1999-2009 never went above 1.8 per 100,000 population on any given year, compared to the U.S. where the rates had been between 5 and 5.8.

The total homicide count in 2009 was one, compared to the UK's 724 and Brazil's 43,909. 

In 2005 there were a total of 98 sexual offences per 100,000 inhabitants and 443 cases of violence against a person.
