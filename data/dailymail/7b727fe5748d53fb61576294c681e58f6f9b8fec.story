A man whose homeless and schizophrenic son died from injuries in police custody says he has rejected compensation of almost $1million.

Ron Thomas says he will instead sue the city of Fullerton in California after Kelly Thomas, 37, died after he was allegedly beaten up by police.

He slammed the city’s offer of $900,000 as ‘a huge insult’ after his son was allegedly shocked with a stun gun, beaten with flashlights and kicked.

Mr Thomas told CNN he had originally 
avoided hiring a lawyer because he wanted to be a ‘voice for my son’ but
has since changed his mind.

‘I do need an attorney for this, and 
I've been talking to some,’ he said, following the death of his son 
almost a month ago on July 10.

Witnesses described a shocking attack 
on his son five days before, in which a person in distress can be heard 
calling out for their father.

Police attended a scene where a man 
was allegedly trying to break into cars near a bus station and found 
suspect Kelly Thomas there.

There was an altercation which resulted in Kelly Thomas suffering serious injuries and being taken to hospital, police said.

Mr Thomas claimed the police were ‘rogue cops that were thinking they're above the law’ and ‘brutally beat my son to death’.

He told CNN that fighting for his 
son’s justice has ‘taken a heavy toll on me’ but he has no plans to stop
as he needs to ‘prevail’.

Mr Thomas said he has a printed 
document of the $900,000 offer although the city is now denying they came
forward with the settlement.

The city did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Six police officers have been put on 
administrative leave as the FBI and Orange County's district attorney 
investigate what happened.

‘Any sort of termination, suspension 
or exoneration for the matter will occur at the end of the 
investigation,’ a police spokesman told CNN.

The revelations of what happened have caused growing outrage in the quiet college town.

More than 70 people spoke at the City 
Council meeting on Wednesday, and a city councilwoman called for the 
resignation of the police chief.

Kelly Thomas's father and others were planning a protest outside the police station this weekend, the second in as many weeks.

‘My son needs a voice,’ he said. ‘Now, the people have become Kelly's voice and, yeah, I'm leading the charge.’
