This is the shocking moment a waterspout swept ashore knocking adult sunbathers flat and lifting furniture - and a small child - into the air.

Videos captured by several people on their mobile phones show the moment the waterspout, which is effectively a tornado over water, hits the beach in the city of Recife, in the eastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco.

From there it went up the beach, tearing up sun umbrellas before dying out almost as suddenly as it arrived.

Local police said that although they had several reports and an ambulance had been at the scene, nobody had been seriously injured

The waterspout went up the beach, tearing up sun umbrellas and even sucking up and spitting out a small child - who was unharmed - before dying out almost as suddenly as it arrived

Eyewitness Salviano Alaniz, 36, who was on the beach with his wife, said: 'I spotted something out to sea which seem to be a dark area and then I realised it was a waterspout moving towards the shore. 

'I didn't realise how strong it was and nobody else seemed to be worried until it suddenly hit the beach - and started knocking people flat.

'Those who didn't fall over ran away as fast as they could, and I saw seven bits of furniture swept up into the air including a child that was lifted a short way before being thrown out of the waterspout and across the sand.'

Local meteorologist Edvania Santos said that they were currently analysing the images posted online to try and work out how the rare natural phenomena had occurred.

He said: 'There are some unusual weather patterns happening at the moment which will probably be to blame, and from the videos it looks like a classic waterspout - but we will need to study the footage more carefully before producing a report.'

Local police said that although they had several reports and an ambulance had been at the scene, nobody including the child that had been sucked into the air had been seriously injured, with just a few people suffering minor cuts and bruises.
