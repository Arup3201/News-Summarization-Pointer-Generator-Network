The identity of Mr WH has been puzzled over for centuries after it appeared in Shakespeare's book of sonnets

The identity of the man Shakespeare's book of sonnets was dedicated to  - a enigma that has puzzled scholars for centuries - may now finally have been established.

The first edition of Shakespeare's sonnets, published in 1609, were dedicated to a 'Mr W H', whose identity has never been proven - leading to claims it could have been a male lover.

But an American researcher has now uncovered evidence to suggest he was not, in fact, a male lover or nobleman, but a recently deceased friend of the sonnets' publisher.

Inscribed in the first published edition of the sonnets is a dedication to the man, whose identity has been subjected to fierce debate for centuries.

The message reads: 'To the only begetter of these ensuing sonnets Mr W H. All happiness and that eternity promised by our ever-living poet wisheth the well-wishing adventurer in setting forth.'

It ends with the letters 'TT' - believed to be the mark of the sonnets' publisher, Thomas Thorpe.

The Guardian reported researcher Geoffrey Caveney has now found evidence linking the initials to William Holme, who was an associate of Thorpe's.

The two were both publishing apprentices in London, had theatre connections and came from prominent families in Chester.

Mr Caveney said evidence for his conclusions included that Holme died two years before the sonnets were published and it would have been an insult to refer to an aristocrat as 'Mr' - ruling out Mr W. H's identity as a nobleman.

His theory, that it was a tribute to someone deceased, would also explain the spiritual theme of the message.

Mr Caveney said: Nobody was aware that there was [also] a publisher of that name who had died in 1607,' said Caveney. 'Seeing the dedication as a memorial makes a lot of sense,' according to the Guardian.

Throughout the centuries since the sonnets were published, speculation about Mr W. H's identity has varied wildly.

The most likely candidates were often thought to have been his friends Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, or William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke.

Oscar Wilde explored a different theory, writing a fictional 1889 story about whether it could be a cross-dressing boy actor called Willie Hughes - and the same person as the 'fair youth' of the sonnets.

That could also help explain punning references to the name 'Will', it was claimed.

The world's most famous playwright has long caused controversy among literary scholars. 

Last year, a new debate broke out between some of the world's top Shakespeare experts over whether the playwright's sonnets prove he was attracted to men.

Sir Brian Vickers, a visiting professor at University College London, began the row by condemning a book review which suggested Sonnet 116 appears in a 'primarily homosexual context'.

In a letter to the Times Literary Supplement, he said the claim was 'anachronistic' because scholars now accept there were forms of rhetoric that allowed men to express love without implying sexual attraction.

But the most enduring debate about the Bard is whether or not the playwright wrote everything that has been attributed to him.

Doubts have surrounded Shakespeare's authorship for 150 years, with Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe and Edward de Vere named as the likely writers of his sonnets and plays. 

And recently, Shakespeare's well-delivered lines have even been blamed for creating a painful stigma for millions of people suffering skin disease.

Researchers from Nottingham, Leicester and Derby, analysed Shakespeare’s language and found that it reflected the Elizabethan obsession with perfect, unmarked, pale skin.

One of the most graphic examples occurs when King Lear insults his scheming daughter Goneril, declaring: 'Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbuncle'.
