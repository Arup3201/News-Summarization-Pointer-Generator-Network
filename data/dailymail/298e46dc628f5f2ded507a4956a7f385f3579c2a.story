Fulham are closing on an £800,000 deal for Boca Juniors defensive starlet Tiago Casasola.

The 19-year-old has been watched by Barcelona, Roma and Tottenham scouts in recent months but Championship Fulham have stolen the initiative and hope to wrap up a deal for the Argentina U20 international over the weekend.

Casasola has an Italian passport so would not require work permit.
