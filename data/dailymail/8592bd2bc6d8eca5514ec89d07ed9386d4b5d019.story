Olympic swimming champion Grant Hackett has spoken about his life-changing five-week stint in an Arizona rehab clinic this year, confessing that his addiction to Stilnox sleeping pills played a major role in him seeking help.

The gold medallist also said that a 'sustained amount of pressure and stress' and his bitter divorce from Australian singer Candice Alley led him to get treatment.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline about his rehab experience for the first time, he said he was reluctant and 'scared' to go to the US clinic - but was persuaded to go by his dad.

'I was in denial about [help] for a long time, I thought I could manage everything and anything,’ he said on Thursday.

Better than ever: Grant Hackett is looking forward to returning to the spotlight this weekend after his time away in rehab

His spell in rehab followed a bizarre incident in February when he was filmed half-naked in the foyer of Melbourne's Crown Casino.

After his initial reluctance, the 34-year-old admitted he formed ‘great relationships’ from the experience.

'There was a bit of reluctance because you don’t know what you’re getting yourself into,’ Hackett said.

He confessed he was a ‘little bit frightened’ and a ‘little bit scared’ before boarding the plane to America but he has now described his time away as a ‘great personal development’ lesson and has spoken about the great friends he made inside the clinic.

'I got a real insight into myself, what motivates me, where I’ve had difficulties throughout my life,' he said.

'A lot of people in there were really high-achieving individuals who had just been through tough periods.

'It's a very safe environment where you feel you can make yourself vulnerable and recover properly. Through the course of that vulnerability you do make great relationships,' he said.

It was initially reported Hackett entered rehab because of an addiction to Stilnox, a prescription anti-anxiety drug and sleeping pill that is given to patients to treat insomnia and anxiety.

Until now he has declined to say that the drug actually led to his admittance.

'It wasn’t really that to be honest, I have to steer a bit clear of that because of legal proceedings… but what I can tell you is that yes, definitely, I was using sleeping medication for a little while there, but that wasn’t the only thing,' he confessed.

He also said his hectic life as an executive at Westpac bank, a presenter at Channel Nine, studying for a master’s degree and 'going through a very very public divorce that was extremely difficult to cope with' meant he didn’t give himself the time to rest.

'I was doing that not for weeks or months – I did that for years, it’s just not a sustainable way of living.'

Hackett and Alley first announced their separation in 2012 and divorced in August 2013.

'Because of my athletic background I thought it was a weakness to say "I need help",' he said.

Hackett’s father Neville previously said the family staged a form of intervention to get the former sportsman into ‘one of the best’ rehab facilities in the world.

Long term use: Hackett was first prescribed Stilnox over ten years ago by doctors to help him wind down after competitions

'Extremely difficult': Hackett confessed he was going through 'a very very public divorce' and did not give himself enough time to rest

He said what rehab really helped him to do was get to the root of his problems and thus rid himself of his reliance on the medication.

'Why wasn’t I sleeping? Why wasn’t I feeling like I was on top of it?... It’s more getting to the crux of it and also getting rid of those band aid solutions.'

Doctors first prescribed Hackett Stilnox over ten years ago, to help him switch off at night after competitions.

'Sometimes you can't come down after those events. That's why I used Stilnox back then. It was the particular medication that doctors prescribed. 10 odd years ago they said "this is the medication to use" because it doesn’t have too many side effects… and it's got no hangover effect,' he explained.

Hackett has battled with an addiction to the drug previously and in 2012 he called it 'evil'. 

He said when he was first prescribed the pill it was ‘absolutely innocent’ and he holds no grudges against the doctors who gave it to him.

'You could wake up the next morning and compete at the highest level again, so that was the rational and logic behind it.'

Hackett said although not all athletes have trouble switching off at night he is the 'sort of person with a very analytical mind'.

'I’m a real thinker so often for me to do that, switch off, is not necessarily as easy as it is for the average person,' he explained.

His advice to any young athletes looking for help now would be to 'avoid it all costs'.

These days Hackett turns to more natural remedies, including meditation and mindfulness to wind down.

'It's not the sort of stuff I was a big believer in before… but I try and do that at the end of each day just to get out of my own head so to speak.'

And his personal life is also back to a 'very happy place'.

He refused to go into detail about his children, twins Jagger Emilio and Charlize Alley, because of legal proceedings.

'But of course, they are the absolute centre of my world as you can imagine,' he said.

Moving on: Hackett knows his public image has taken a battering in recent years but hopes he will be judged by his 'actions moving forwards'

Hackett is spending most of his time in Queensland with family and friends at the moment and revealed he is currently single

'I'm always dating someone here and there but I haven’t actually dated anyone yet. I’m just laying low.'

Hackett  knows his public image has taken a battering in recent years but hopes he will be judged by his 'actions moving forwards'.

'I'm the sort of person that if you give me a second chance, I'll take it with both hands,' he said.

'I'm always going to make mistakes but I’m going to try and keep them to an absolute minimum.'

The swimmer said what matters most to him is his very close friends and family and making them proud.

Life-changing: The 34-year-old, seen here with his parents, has found new ways to cope with his 'chaotic' lifestyle and is glad that he finally got help

'They're there if I win gold medals or if I’m seen at the Crown or whatever it may be that stems from that,' he explained.

Hackett will return to the public spotlight on Sunday, when he appears on Channel Nine’s Wide World Of Sports alongside former cricketer Michael Slater.

'I'm in a really good healthy physical and mental state and I feel like I’m in a place where I’m ready to jump back into that chaotic life,' he said.

Four months after he was filmed wandering in the Crown casino foyer wearing a singlet over his underpants, he said: ‘I don’t think I need to go around with my head down or anything like that.

'I'm going to get on with the job. I made a mistake. I put my hand up and take full accountability and responsibility for that. Now I’ve just got to get on with it.'
