Sharon Shoesmith has said she is on benefits and is unemployable after being blamed for the Baby P case

THE social services chief whose team failed to save the life of Baby P has revealed that she is on the dole and unemployable.

Sharon Shoesmith lost her job  as Haringey council’s director of children’s services in the fallout  over care given to Peter Connelly, who died aged 17 months after suffering horrific abuse despite being seen by social workers and doctors 60 times.

She has waged a long battle to be cleared of any personal responsibility for the child’s death in 2007.

And now she has revealed how criticism over her handling of the affair saw her consider suicide, and how she is so scared of revenge attacks she rarely ventures out.

Mrs Shoesmith, 59, also suggests  that too many ‘at-risk’ children are taken into care – and that they  would be better left with their parents, despite concerns.

Evidently still angry at her treatment, she suggests that inquiries into failures by social services should not be conducted in the public glare.

She claims it was only social workers who faced disciplinary action over the case, apparently ignoring the fact that two doctors were investigated. 

Mrs Shoesmith was sacked from her highly-paid job in 2008 amid mounting public uproar over the death of baby Peter in August 2007 at the hands of his mother Tracey Connelly, 31, her sadistic paedophile boyfriend Steve Barker, 36, and his brother Jason Owen, 40.

The senior social worker launched an appeal claiming unfair dismissal and eventually won. Despite reports she was due £1million in compensation, she says she has not yet received the payment, and that she faces huge legal bills.

Speaking to Public Servant magazine, Mrs Shoesmith said: ‘What I didn’t know before, but I have learned over the past four years, is that you don’t recover from this – it stays with you. Your entire past is just wiped away and your future is utterly gone.

‘There was a sense of, “If we hit her hard enough, she will never stand up again”, and I nearly didn’t. It is  very hard to understand what that feels like.

‘People I used to know ask me what I’m doing now, and they’re shocked when I say “Nothing”.

‘They can’t quite grasp that my life hasn’t moved on at all in the past four years – that I can’t find any work and I’m living on benefits.

‘I used to have a £130,000-a-year job running my own department and was a national reference point for Ofsted for special educational needs, but no organisation will take the risk of employing me because of who I am.’

Reports blaming her for Peter’s death drove her to consider suicide, and even to question whether she had murdered him herself, before seeking counselling. ‘I was certainly no softy, but being held directly responsible for the brutal murder of a child was something that I found impossible to live with,’ said Mrs Shoesmith.

‘I remember turning to my two grown-up daughters in tears and asking them, “Did I murder him?” I was in such a state that I actually believed I had killed him.’

She added that four years after her sacking she is still scared of being recognised and abused in public, and claimed police warned her she could be pushed in front of a Tube train. Mrs Shoesmith maintains that social workers do a good job and should not be vilified because of the ‘very small number of children who are murdered’.

‘We are so desperately fearful of getting it wrong that we cannot calibrate our own success,’ she said. ‘We have to get back to supporting social workers to use their professional skills to make reasoned judgments.

‘Then the crucial next bit, where no one wants to go, is that we have to accept mistakes happen.

‘The big dilemma for local government is that no one knows what to do with child homicide and whether social workers should be held responsible. It will happen and we cannot prevent it.’

After implying that inquiries  into social services failings should not be conducted in the public eye, and claiming that only social workers faced disciplinary action over baby Peter’s death, she suggested more ‘at-risk’ children should be left at home.

‘There is political pressure to take more children into care earlier to prevent them being harmed,’ she said. ‘But if the figure rises, is that a success or a failure?’
