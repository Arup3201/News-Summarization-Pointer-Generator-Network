He is a magnet for drama, isn’t he? Life with Mario Balotelli is never dull and so it proved again. There is a reason it is always him.

A coolly dispatched 84th-minute penalty gives Liverpool a slender advantage to protect in Istanbul but that only tells a fragment of the story of how this most mercurial of strikers delivered for Brendan Rodgers when it mattered most.

When Jordon Ibe was bundled over by Ramon Motta, Jordan Henderson seemed certain to take the captain’s role and assume responsibility for the spot-kick. Daniel Sturridge also wanted to take it. But then up popped Balotelli, who took the ball off Henderson and put it on the spot.

 From the scenes that followed, that decision was anything but popular. But as some squabbled and manager Rodgers looked on stone-faced, Balotelli barely flickered. He simply tapped Henderson on the arm, told him he was fine and then casual sent Cenk Goken the wrong way.

This was his third big contribution in a week, following on from a goal against Tottenham and a free-kick that led to Adam Lallana’s winner at Crystal Palace, and how it was needed. This tie, as Besiktas manager Slaven Bilic noted, is far from over and another test of character awaits in Istanbul.

Finally, however, Liverpool are winning again in Europe. Rodgers message before this contest was a hope and desire that they would play with verve and dash and show Europe a glimpse of the dynamic brand that almost carried them to the title.

The Champions League campaign, after all, had been a washout. Liverpool’s performances in those six games with Real Madrid, Ludogorets and Basle were miserable and never threatened to take them to the latter stages.

Having won their opening contest in September with a late penalty, Liverpool then lurched from bad to worse and did not win any of their remaining five fixtures. A failure to beat Besiktas, then, would have seen them set an unwanted club record of most games without a victory in Europe.

In the first attack, you could see the difference between the Liverpool of then and now as a slick move, which involved Joe Allen and Ibe, ended with Sturridge hoodwinking Ersan Gulum with a deft back heel but goalkeeper Cenk Gonen parried his shot.

Stood in his technical area, Rodgers acknowledged the passage of passing with a thumbs up but the period of domination he might have expected to follow did not arrive, as Besiktas showed themselves to be obdurate opponents.They frustrated Tottenham at White Hart Lane in this competition last October and it was easy to see why they have been so proficient, as they worked relentlessly and had menace on the break.

They almost took the lead in the 32nd minute when, from Jose Sosa’s corner, Veli Kavlak wriggled free of Emre Can but his header lacked the direction to bother Simon Mignolet and it whistled over the bar.

In the next attack, memories of how the Premier League crown slipped away in April were evoked as Demba Ba was sent scuttling through towards The Kop. We had been here before, former Chelsea striker Ba with the ball at his feet, defenders trying to catch up with him but this time Mignolet was equal to the task.

That jolted a response from Liverpool and, as some hefty tackles were traded, they finished an intriguing first 45 minutes on the front foot, with first the impressive Alberto Moreno, from fully 35 yards, and then Henderson testing Gonen.

When Besiktas were last at Anfield in November 2007, they saw a 2-0 interval deficit become an 8-0 full-time mauling and the way Liverpool started the second period suggested they were in the mood to do something similar. They really should have broken the deadlock in the 48th minute.

Henderson, once again a figure of perpetual motion in the heart of Liverpool’s midfield, scampered down the right flank and managed to fire in a cross that caused all sorts of confusion between Gonen, Besiktas second choice keeper, and defender Pedro Franco.

Comically colliding together, they succeeded to present Adam Lallana with a glorious chance but the England international lost his composure and carelessly hoisted the opening above the bar.

Not long after, Rodgers took decisive action. Off came Joe Allen and Philippe Coutinho and they were replaced by Dejan Lovren and Balotelli, allowing Can to move into midfield alongside Henderson and keep Liverpool pressing up the pitch.

Eventually the move reaped dividends. Whether Balotelli was given hearty support in the dressing room is open to debate but that should not matter.

He made a difference. Winning is all that counts.
