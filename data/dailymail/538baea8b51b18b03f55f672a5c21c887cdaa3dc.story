A condolence letter
from President Lyndon Johnson to the widow of slain civil rights
leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was sold for just half the price expected at an auction on Thursday.

The typed note from Johnson to Coretta Scott King dated
April 5, 1968, the day after King was gunned down by a white supremacist in Memphis,Tennessee, sold for $60,000 at Quinn's Auction Galleries in Falls Church, Virginia.

The 47-year-old correspondence, written on White House Stationary, expressed the then Commander-in-Chief's sadness at the civil rights leader's death and reiterated his determination to find the assassin.

Historic: The letter from President Johnson to Coretta Scott King, dated April 5, 1968, the day after King was shot by a white supremacist, has sold for $60,000 at Quinn's Auction Galleries in Falls Church, Virginia

Relationship: Johnson (pictured shaking King's hand during the signing of the Civil Rights Bill in 1964) told his widow they would do everything possible to track down his killer 

It read: 'We will overcome this calamity and continue the work of
justice and love that is Martin Luther King's legacy and trust
to us.

'Since early morning, I have devoted all my hours and energy to honoring your good husband in the manner he would most approve. I have sought — by word, deed and official act — to unite this sorrowing and troubled nation against further and wider violence. '

Johnson won election to his own four-year term in 1964 but
chose not to run again in 1968 after Kennedy's younger brother,
Robert F. Kennedy, then a U.S. senator from New York, entered
the race for the Democratic nomination. RFK was himself
assassinated in Los Angeles two months after King was slain.

The opening bid was $60,000, the sum an online bidder ultimately
paid for it, though the item had been expected to fetch at least $120,000, according to the company's website.

Auctioneer Matthew Quinn said the letter had special
resonance given the 50th anniversary this month of the 'Bloody
Sunday' protest march at Selma, Alabama, a turning point in the
U.S. civil rights movement, and the release of the King-centered
movie, 'Selma.'

Collection: Sixteen MLK items in all sold for a total of $99,668. They included a guest book with more than 1,500 signatures from one of two wakes for King (bottom)

However he told The Washington Post the turnout of the sale was unexpected: 'We’re obviously disappointed. But that’s what the market does.'

Coretta Scott King held on to the letter until 2003, then
gave it to singer and social activist Harry Belafonte. She died
in 2006.

When Belafonte tried to auction it off in 2008, King's
children objected, and the sale was canceled. The two sides
became embroiled in a legal battle.

A 2014 settlement allowed Belafonte to keep the letter and
Belafonte gave it to his half-sister, Shirley Cooks. She and her
husband, Stoney Cooks, a staff member of King's Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, put it up for sale with other
memorabilia.

Stoney Cooks said the letter was remarkable because Johnson,
who had signed landmark civil rights legislation into law, wrote
it while grappling with the unrest unleashed by King's murder.

'I thought that quick response showed something about the
nature of the relationship between the two men,' Cooks said.
