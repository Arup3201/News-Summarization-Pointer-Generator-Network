Carl Jenkinson believes West Ham have made a statement of intent by drafting in no fewer than nine new players this summer.

The on-loan defender from Arsenal was one of many new faces at Upton Park, including the likes of Alex Song, Enner Valencia, Mauro Zarate and Morgan Amalfitano.

And the 22-year-old right back says the ambition shown in the transfer market is one of the reasons he moved to West Ham for the season from Arsenal.

He told whufc.com: 'We've made some great signings and that was half the reason I joined. The Club is clearly making a big push this season and we've signed some more players since I signed. I think that's a real sign of intent.

'Hopefully the players we have brought in, along with myself, can do ourselves justice in a West Ham shirt.'

Jenkinson, who met West Ham fans at their store in Lakeside Shopping Centre on Tuesday, is looking forward to playing with former Arsenal midfielder Song, who joined on a season-long loan from Barcelona.

'Alex justifies the response he got at the stadium on Saturday (when he was unveiled) because everybody knows how big a signing he is for the club,' Jenkinson said. 'He has played for some of the biggest clubs in the world and you don't do that through luck.

'He is a top player and West Ham have done very well to bring him in. Me, as much as the rest of the boys and the fans, are very excited to have him on board because he'll bring an awful lot to the side.

'He hasn't played regularly for a while now, so he needs to get his fitness up as he has said, but when he's firing on all cylinders he'll be a fantastic player for West Ham, I'm sure.'

Jenkinson has missed West Ham's first three Premier League games after suffering a hamstring injury during a friendly against Schalke.

But the young defender hopes to be fit in time for West Ham's next game, at Hull City on September 15. 

'Fingers crossed, I should be back for the next game,' Jenkinson said. 'It seems like a long time out, but I have only missed three league games, so it's not been the end of the world. I'll be back soon and hopefully I can do the business on the pitch.'
