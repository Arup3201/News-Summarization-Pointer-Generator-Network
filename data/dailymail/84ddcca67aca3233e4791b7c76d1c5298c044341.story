This is the inquisitive puppy who gave himself and his owners a fright after he got his head stuck in the plug hole of a kitchen sink.

Tyson became trapped in the discarded basin while he was out playing with his brother Rocky in a Leicestershire garden on Sunday.

Thankfully the poor eight-week-old was released by vets later, after an attempt to ease his head back out using shampoo as a lubricant failed at home.

Tyson was fed a sedative and as he relaxed medical staff gave his little body a wiggle and his head slipped back out of the plug hole.

Poor puppy: Eight-week-old Tyson the dog was playing in the garden when he somehow got his head lodged in the sink

Free: It was only when taken to the vets that Tyson's head was freed using a sedative to relax him

Owner Nilu Odedra, from Leicester, had to drive Tyson - and the kitchen sink - to an animal surgery, where vets were relieved to find a sedative and a bit of manoeuvring was all that was needed to free the German shepherd rottweiler cross.

'The pair of them were playing in the garden with my daughter, Sonal, and she went upstairs to get changed into some old clothes so she didn't get dirty,' his owner said today.

'We heard barking and I thought something must be wrong because they never bark.

'My daughter started shouting to me. I ran down to her and saw Tyson had got his head stuck in the the wastage plug hole of the sink.'

Freed and happy: Tyson just after his head was eased out of the sink by professionals on Sunday

Nilu and Sonal, 19, tried to use shampoo to lubricate the area around Tyson's neck, but it was no use.

She said: 'He didn't like that and my daughter was crying and panicking and I didn't know what to do.

'Luckily, he is the lazy one of the pair of dogs and he wasn't really panicking.'

They rang vets at Park Vet Hospital and bundled Tyson and the sink into the car.

Vet nurse Faye Martin and colleague Ariel Korber treated Tyson.

Faye, who has worked at the surgery for seven years, said: 'I have never seen anything like it.

'It was really quite funny to see this tiny head sticking out of this huge sink.

'I've had dogs with things stuck in their mouths, but never anything like this.'

Tyson was given a small sedative to relax him and within minutes vets manoeuvred his head free.

Faye said: 'He was a bit embarrassed when he was free. My practice manager said he looked a bit washed out, poor thing, but he was fine.'

Nilu said the adventurous pup was back to his normal busy self within a few hours.

She said: 'He was running around and we had all the family round to make a fuss of him.'
