Missouri Governor
Jay Nixon said on Tuesday violence will not be tolerated in any
protests that come after a grand jury decides whether or not to
indict a white police officer for shooting dead an unarmed black
teen in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.

Nixon said he would bring in police from around the state
and have the National Guard on stand-by for the grand jury
decision that is likely to come in mid to late November.

The August shooting of Michael Brown, 18, by Darren Wilson
sparked weeks of street protests demonstrations and some groups
have threatened extensive protests if the officer is not charged
with a crime.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon (pictured on August 16) said on Tuesday that law enforcement officials have been working around the clock to make sure residents and businesses are kept safe once prosecutors announce whether a suburban St. Louis police officer will face charges for fatally shooting 18-year-old Michael Brown

'That ugliness was not representative of Missouri and it
cannot be repeated,' Nixon said at a news conference.

'The National Guard has been and will continue to be part of
our contingency planning,' he said, adding that the state will
work to keep people safe.

Rumors of an impending decision on the indictment have
flooded social media for days, prompting St. Louis County
Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch on Monday to reiterate his
expectation that the grand jury would not make a decision until
mid-to-late November.

McCulloch, whose prosecutors have been presenting evidence
to the grand jury, said his office would advise the public when
a determination has been made

Weeks of protests followed the August 9 shooting of Brown nd officials are trying to make sure things remain calm once the grand jury decision is announced. Nixon said looting and violence that marred mostly peaceful protests will not be tolerated.

Nixon said that once the decision is announced, the state highway patrol will work with St. Louis County and city police as one unified command. The National Guard will also be available if needed.

During the protests after the shooting, police donned riot gear and patrolled in armored vehicles, drawing widespread criticism and raising questions about a program that supplies surplus military equipment to local police departments.

A small number of protesters in those first few days attacked squad cars, tossed molotov cocktails at officers and, in a few cases, shot guns in the direction of police and looted local businesses. Police responded with tear gas, smoke canisters and rubber bullets. On many nights, dozens were arrested.

St. Louis County police initially handled security, but criticism of their tactics prompted Nixon to put Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson in charge. He and other police leaders said the response was necessary to protect officers, protesters and the public.

Some protest organizers fear police will be heavy-handed after the grand jury announcement.

Ashley Yates of St. Louis, co-creator of the group Millennial Activists United noted that the vast majority of protests have been peaceful and said Nixon should focus on addressing the systemic problems faced by minority communities, "not reactionary policing techniques."

It isn't just law enforcement getting ready for the announcement. Organizers of Yates' group and other protesters gathered Tuesday for training that includes how to take notes and shoot video of police actions on the streets.

"There is a significant effort to make sure that people's rights are protected and that there's no violence on either side," said Andy Stepanian, a spokesman for several protest groups.
