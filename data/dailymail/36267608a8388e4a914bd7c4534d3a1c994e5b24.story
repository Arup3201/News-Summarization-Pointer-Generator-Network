Wayne Rooney is just four goals away from claiming Sir Bobby Charlton's crown as England's all-time top scorer after finding the net twice during Tuesday's 3-1 victory against Scotland.

However, the debate over whether the Three Lions frontman is a 'football great' continues to rage on.

Whether or not the Manchester United star compares to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, Sportsmail duo Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher insist Rooney is  heavily relied upon by England.

Speaking to Sky Sports, Redknapp said: 'When we talk about big-game players we talk about Wayne Rooney and that's what he is.

'When we needed him most tonight he was the one who came up with the goals. There should never be a point where he can be dropped in his England career, he needs to be in that side. It's between Welbeck and Sturridge who plays beside him.’

Carragher, not convinced Rooney is up there with the very best, added: 'Of course he's an England great. He's going to be our greatest goalscorer. Is he a world great, is he a Messi or Ronaldo? No he's not. But he's an England great. 

The former Liverpool defender, who himself earned 38 international caps, insists Rooney is an integral part of Roy Hodgson's side and said: 'He should always be in the England team, it's nonsense to say he shouldn't. I can't remember the last time he played great for England but he sets up goals and he scores them when they need them.

'He's an England great, he's not a world great. Only the 1966 World Cup winners and Lineker getting the Golden Boot have lit up World Cups for England.' 

However, former Scotland international Graeme Souness isn't convinced and believes a time may arise where Hodgson decides to drop Rooney.

'He's scoring against Championship players tonight so let's not get carried away with him tonight. Yes, on the basis of tonight, he was excellent. But is Rooney up there with the greats in the world? No he isn't. You can't say we'll play him all the time - you cannot say we'll never, ever leave him out, because he isn’t undroppable.’
