Three state troopers have testified in the murder trial of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez about evidence they recovered.

The former NFL star is charged in the June 2013 death of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée.

Trooper Zachary Johnson testified on Thursday about going to Lloyd's home in Massachusetts on the evening his body was found and alerting his family that he was dead.

He also spoke about a safe that police found in the closet of Hernandez's master bedroom at his home in North Attlenoro. Inside, he said, was a digital scale and a dish with what he said was marijuana residue.

Azia Jenkins, uncle to Shaneah and Shayanna Jenkins, points to the defendant during the murder trial for former NFL player Aaron Hernandez on Wednesday. Mr Jenkins said Hernandez was worried about his endorsement deals following his arrest in connection to Odin Lloyd's murder 

Another trooper spoke at length about how he recovered video surveillance from Hernandez's home.

Hernandez's lawyers have tried to poke holes in the state's case by going after how police handled evidence.

On Wednesday, jurors heard from Azia Jenkins, uncle of Hernandez's fiancée Shayanna Jenkins, who said the football player matter-of-factly told people that his endorsement days were over a day after Odin Lloyd's killing.  

Mr Jenkins was called to the stand in Hernandez's murder trial by prosecutor William McCauley, who asked him what happened on June 18, 2013.

Odin Lloyd's body had been found the day before in an industrial park not far from Hernandez's home in North Attleboro.

Lloyd had been dating Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna.

Azia Jenkins testified that Shayanna had called him that morning asking him to come from Connecticut to pick up another uncle, Donnie Smith.

Smith and Shaneah Jenkins had gone to Hernandez's home that morning after Shaneah had been told by police that Lloyd was dead.

Azia Jenkins said he had arrived at the Hernandez home that afternoon and was preparing to leave when police arrived and spoke with him in the driveway. He said he went to the police station, then returned to the Hernandez home.

Upon his return, he said, Hernandez wanted to know what police had asked him.

After a brief conversation, Jenkins, Hernandez and Smith went to the basement to play pool and watch Game 6 of the NBA Finals. A commercial came on, Jenkins said.

'Aaron said, ''My endorsements are gone,''' Mr Jenkins testified.

He said that Hernandez didn't elaborate and that he appeared 'cool, calm, collected'.

At the time of the slaying, Hernandez had a $40 million contract with the Patriots and an endorsement deal with CytoSport, the company that makes Muscle Milk. He also had a two-year contract with the sportswear company Puma.

He was arrested in Lloyd's murder on June 26 and cut by the Patriots soon after.

Also Wednesday, Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh ruled that prosecutors may not call to the stand Hernandez's high school friend Robert Paradis.

Paradis testified when the jury was out of the courtroom that he had visited Hernandez in April 2013 at his condo in Los Angeles. 

He said Hernandez told him he kept 'fire' or 'heat' under the seat of his car and indicated it was a .45-caliber weapon, the same as the murder weapon, which has never been found.

Paradis said that after Hernandez left the condo, Hernandez called back to ask him to check whether he had left 'it' in his bedroom. 

Paradis opened a drawer, saw a black shirt wrapped around an object and lifted it up but never opened it. He said it felt like a gun.

The judge said Paradis' statements were inconsistent and would be prejudicial.

The court also heard on Wednesday from Keelia Smyth, former manager of an Enterprise rental car branch in North Attleboro.

Ms Smyth told the court that Hernandez returned a damaged Nissan Altima on the afternoon of June 17, 2013.

In it, she said, was something she believed to be a bullet stuck to a piece of chewed blue gum and a child's drawing.

Hernandez had offered her a piece of blue gum before he left, she said. 

Enterprise worker Keelia Smyth said Hernandez returned a damaged Nissan Altima asking for an SUV on June 18, 2013
