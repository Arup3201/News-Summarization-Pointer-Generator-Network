For nearly three decades the Berlin Wall divided a city, splitting the communist east from the western capitalist enclave deep inside East Germany.

Built by the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany, in 1961, the wall cut off West Berlin from the east, and stopped East Germans leaving for the Federal Republic of Germany, or West Germany, and other European countries.

Now, almost 25 years to the day since the wall fell on November 9, 1989, the German capital's appearance has changed dramatically, with the widely-hated structure replaced by modern buildings and bustling streets.

East Germany disappeared less than a year later when the country was reunited, and although a few sections of the wall remain at their original sites, as does the famous 'Checkpoint Charlie', most of it was quickly pulled down with demolition carried out between the summer of 1990 and 1992.

A quarter of a century on, the city is almost unrecognisable, as this gallery comparing images of the Berlin Wall when it stood with the same locations in the reunified German capital today shows.

Changes: People started to pull down the Berlin Wall all after the East German Government allowed people to visit the West of the city on November 9, 1989. The top picture shows people dancing on the wall at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin the day after the ruling, while the bottom image shows how the landmark looks 25 years on

Bustling: The Berlin Wall was built by East Germany in 1961, and the top image shows the wall around the Brandenburg Gate on Nov 19, 1961. Today the same area is filled with cars, buses and people moving freely around the German capital

Taste of freedom: East Berlin citizens push through the newly-created passage at Bernauer Strasse, where East German border police tore down segments of the wall on November 11, 1989. Almost 25 years later people walk over the crossing at Bernauer Strasse and Oderberger Strasse

Transformation: In August 1962 (top) the Potsdamer Platz was empty with the Wall cutting it in two. Today it is a busy public square and traffic intersection, visited by up to 100,000 people a day. On July 21, 1990, the Platz played host to a charity concert organised by Pink Floyd's Roger Waters to commemorate the end of the division between East and West Germany

Attraction: Checkpoint Charlie was the best-known crossing point along the Berlin Wall, and is seen here being visited by U.S. President John F Kennedy, seen walking past a cordon of saluting servicemen and the sentry post on June 26, 1963. Today, the rebuilt checkpoint is a tourist attraction, manned by actors wearing replica uniforms

Presidential visit: President Kennedy looks out across the Berlin Wall into East Germany during his visit on June 26, 1963. Now tourists can visit this attraction to get something of a sense of what living with the wall was like

Building work:  The top image shows East German workers and troops building the wall in front of the historic Reichstag building on November 20, 1961. After German reunification in 1990, the building - which had fallen into disuse - was the subject of a major renovation by Sir Norman Foster and now houses the German parliament

Peeking over: A child looks out onto the other side of the Wall as she climbs a pile of sand at a playground in July 1981. Cars now park at the  same spot in Berlin's Kreuzberg district

Transport: On March 12, 1971, anyone wanting to cross the Berlin Wall had to pass through checkpoints, such as this one at Heinrich-Heine-Strasse, while today people are free to cycle, drive and walk through the area, which has completely transformed

Similarities: A few of the buildings visible in this photograph of U.S. President Richard Nixon looking across the communist wall into East Germany during his stay in the divided city on February 27, 1969 are still visible today, while others in the area surrounding Checkpoint  Heinrich-Heine-Strasse have been replaced with more modern versions

A river runs through it: A woman looks out across the Spree river at the Berlin Wall in 1980, with construction work taking place at the Charite hospital in background. Today a bridge links the two sides of the river, which has a number of modern buildings along its banks

Memorial: The words 'The wall must fall' has been scrawled across the Berlin Wall along Bernauer Strasse in the north of Berlin when the top picture was taken on March 8, 1973. Now a memorial marker, made out of metal rods stands at the same spot, where on the night of November 10, 1989, the first segments of the Wall were knocked down  to create a new crossing between East and West Berlin

Changing places: The buildings seen in this picture of East Berlin, taken from an observation platform in Bernauer Strasse in the West in 1980 still remain, although they have been painted. Trams now run along the site where the wall once stood

Cut off: A group of children play alongside the barbed wire-topped Berlin Wall at Sebastianstrasse near Heinrich-Heine-Strasse in 1968, where today a man walks over the once-divided street

Building work: East German policemen in work dress remove barbed wire from a brick wall while other officers in the background are raising the wall to 15 feet at the border between the French and Russian sector at Bernauer Strasse in Berlin on September 9, 1961. The line where the wall once stood can be seen in the pavement today

So near and yet so far: West Berliners wave to their relatives in East Berlin one year after the Berlin Wall was erected at Bernauer Strasse on August 13, 1962, where today people cross the busy street freely
