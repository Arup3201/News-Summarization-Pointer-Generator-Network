The foreign student arrested over an attempt to blow-up the New York Federal Reserve on Wednesday cited an extremist publication as inspiration for his deadly plans.

Quazi Nafis, 21, reportedly learned how to make a bomb from an 
article published by al-Qaeda in the magazine 
‘Inspire.’

The magazine contained a piece titled, ‘How to Make a Bomb in the Kitchen with your Mom,’ telling 
readers how to construct a detonating bomb with everyday household 
items.

Inspire is an English-language magazine produced by al-Qaeda supporters on the Arabian Peninsula.

One issue specifies how to create a remote-controlled bomb with a list of ingredients and parts followed by a photographic manual.

Another issue suggested that a good way to forward the jihadist mission would be to mow down pedestrians in a pick-up truck.

Handgun training and tips on being an 'urban assassin' are also included in the easily accessible terrorist magazine online.

An American, 26-year-old Samir Khan, from North Carolina, was the driving force behind the publication and penned the piece on making a bomb at your mom's kitchen table.

In another article in 2010, he wrote about his pride at leaving the U.S. and joining al-Qaeda in Yemen. In the piece, Khan mocked the U.S. intelligence agencies and pledged his support to the terrorist group.

He was killed in a 2011 drone strike in Yemen by the CIA along with al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki, another contributor to the magazine.

Despite their deaths, new issues of the magazine have appeared, promoting jihad through explanations on how to start forest fires and build remote-controlled bombs.

Plot: Pedestrians pass the Federal Reserve Building today; authorities arrested a Bangladeshi man they said was plotting to blow up the Federal Reserve

An article written this year is titled 'It Is of Your Freedom to Ignite a Firebomb' - and gives detailed instructions on how to spark a forest-fire, with Montana singled out as the ideal location.

QuaziNafis was arrested in an elaborate FBI sting on Wednesday after attempting to blow up a fake car bomb outside the Federal Reserve building in Manhattan, authorities said.

Before trying to carry out the alleged plot, Nafis went to a warehouse to help assemble a 1,000-pound bomb using inert material.

He also asked an undercover agent to videotape him saying: 'We will not stop until we attain victory or martyrdom.'

Agents grabbed the 21-year-old Nafis - armed with a cellphone he believed was rigged as a detonator - after he made several attempts to blow up the bomb inside a vehicle parked next to the Federal Reserve.

Authorities emphasized that the plot 
never posed an actual risk. However, they claimed the case demonstrated 
the value of using sting operations to neutralize young extremists eager
to harm Americans.

'Attempting to destroy a landmark building and kill or maim untold numbers of innocent bystanders is about as serious as the imagination can conjure,' said Mary Galligan, acting head of the FBI's New York office. 'The defendant faces appropriately severe consequences.'

afis appeared in federal court in Brooklyn to face charges of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and attempting to provide material support to al-Qaeda.

Wearing a brown T-shirt and black jeans, he was ordered held without bail and did not enter a plea. His defense attorney had no comment outside court.

The defendant had sought assurances from an undercover agent posing as an al-Qaeda contact that the terrorist group would support the operation.

'The thing that I want to do, ask you about, is that, the thing I'm doing, it's under al-Qaeda?' he was recorded saying during a meeting in bugged hotel room in Queens, according to the complaint.

In a September meeting in the same hotel room, Nafis 'confirmed he was ready to kill himself during the course of the attack, but indicated he wanted to return to Bangladesh to see his family one last time to set his affairs in order,' the complaint said.

But there was no allegation that Nafis actually received training or direction from the terrorist group.

Prosecutors say Nafis traveled to the U.S. on a student visa in January to carry out an attack. In July, he contacted a confidential informant, telling him he wanted to form a terror cell, the criminal complaint said.

In further conversations, authorities said Nafis proposed several spots for his attack, including the New York Stock Exchange - and that in a written letter taking responsibility for the Federal Reserve job he was about to carry out, he said he wanted to 'destroy America'.

Other communications took place through Facebook. A Twitter account with the suspect's name and photo had six followers and two messages and was linked to a Facebook page that had been taken down.

Federal officials were at the home where Nafis was staying, a red brick building in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens.

Owner Rafiqul Islam said Nafis was staying with his second-floor tenants, and he was told he was related to the family. The tenants didn't answer their door and their apartment was dark.

Islam said the federal officials had come to the home when he was at work in Manhattan. He said Nafis had only lived there about a month or so.

'I didn't notice anything, he spoke to me very quietly,' Islam said. 'He said he was going to be studying here.'

Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the case is one more reminder that New York remains a target:

'New York continues to be very much in the mind frame of terrorism. This individual came here with the express purpose of committing a terrorist attack; he was motivated by al-Qaeda. We see this threat as being with us for a long time to come.'

Kelly said security is always a precaution and there are about a thousand officers in the counterterrorism division. He didn't specify if any additional measures were being taken.

The bank, located at 33 Liberty St., is one of 12 branches around the country that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, make up the Federal Reserve System that serves as the central bank of the United States. It sets interest rates.

The Federal Reserve is one of the most fortified buildings in the city, smack in the middle of a massive security effort headed by the New York Police Department where a network of thousands of private and police cameras watch for suspicious activity.

The department uses sophisticated programs that can search for suspicious activity, like an object in one place for a long time, at the building modeled after London's 'ring of steel'.

The analytic software also is designed to take video and catalog it according to movements, shapes and colors, so officers can set parameters to search the system for, say, a suspicious van.

The Fed is also home to the world's largest accumulation of gold, according to the bank's website. Dozens of governments and central banks store a portion of their gold reserves in high-security vaults deep beneath the building. In recent years, it held 216 million troy ounces of gold, or more than a fifth of all global monetary gold reserves, making it a bigger bullion depository than Fort Knox.
