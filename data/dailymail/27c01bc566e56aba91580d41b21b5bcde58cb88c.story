More than two million Britons are so fat they could be eligible for weight loss surgery, claim researchers.

Operations for weight loss such as the fitting of a gastric band or gastric bypass surgery are available on the NHS to treat those with potentially life-threatening obesity.

Some 8,000 receive treatment called bariatric surgery each year in England.

More than two million Britons are so fat they are eligible for weight loss surgery, new research suggests

But researchers from Imperial College London estimate more than five per cent of adults would qualify, more than 2.1 million people.

A study claimed those fitting the criteria for bariatric surgery were more likely to be women, retired with lower educational qualifications and of lower socio-economic status.

It found that despite evidence of the cost-effectiveness of weight loss surgery, surgery rates were estimated to be a third of the benchmark rate in the NHS.

This means the number of people eligible for surgery ‘far exceeds’ the estimated number of people having procedures.

Researchers, who examined the health of nearly 9,500 people, acknowledged the huge financial implications for the NHS if treatments were carried out in such greater numbers.

But they said more investment may be necessary to meet a growing need for the procedures, says the study published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine Open.

About 8,000 people a year have weight loss surgery, which is also called bariatric surgery, in England

According to NHS guidelines, weight loss surgery may be offered to those whose morbid obesity could kill them, or to people who are morbidly obese and who have a serious condition such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure that could be improved if they lost weight.

Until recently weight loss surgery has risen year on year in England, with rates highest in women and those aged 40-54 years old.

But data shows there was a fall of 10 per cent in the number of weight loss procedures carried out between April 2012 and March 2013, suggesting patients are finding it harder to get referred or treated.

The new study says doctors might not be correctly identifying or referring those eligible, and there may be too little capacity.

It concluded: ‘5.4 per cent of the 
general adult population is eligible for bariatric surgery in England, 
far exceeding the current bariatric surgery uptake.

Each weight loss operation costs the NHS about £8,000 but this is cheaper in the long term than treating obesity related conditions such as diabetes

‘Due to the limited capacity of health services to meet demand under existing criteria, greater investment into service provision may be required to meet a growing need.

‘This would have significant resource implications,’ lead researcher Dr Sonia Saxena said. ‘Despite clear guidelines outlining who can undergo such surgery with the NHS, and evidence that these procedures are cost-effective in the long run, less than one per cent of those eligible have weight loss surgery each year.

‘This raises questions about why more procedures are not currently being carried out.’

She said those most in need of surgery are often least likely to use health care services.

‘Another barrier might be patient awareness of bariatric surgery and commitment to complete lifestyle intervention programmes prior to surgery,’ she added.

Warnings from the Royal College of Surgeons say intensive weight loss programmes - which have to be completed before a patient can be accepted for surgery - are not being run in some areas.

It says there is a ‘postcode lottery’ that in the long run will end up costing the NHS more because obese patients are at risk of serious health problems.

Experts say diabetes alone costs the NHS £3,000 per patient per year for life, whereas the £8,000 cost of bariatric surgery is recouped within three years.

Professor John Wilding, University of Liverpool and a specialist in treating people with severe obesity said: ‘It is essential that the current variations in the availability of services for these people with the most severe and complex obesity are minimised, so that the best and most effective treatments are available for all.’

Professor Paul Aveyard, Department of Primary Care, University of Oxford and a GP said: ‘GPs could do much more to tackle obesity. GPs worry that talking about weight will upset our patients but our fears are largely groundless.’

Professor Jason Halford, University of Liverpool, chair of the UK Association for the Study of Obesity, said there should be more action to target retailers, point of sale promotion and the heavy discounting of unhealthy options to help children avoid making poor food choices.
