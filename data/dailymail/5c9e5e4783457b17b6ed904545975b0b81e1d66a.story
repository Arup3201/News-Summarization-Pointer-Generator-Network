A cannabis addict killed the DJ friend of Bez from Happy Mondays after stabbing him 13 times, before stabbing a young girl, crashing into a pub and eventually taking his own life.   

Darren Gasper, 34, who had smoked cannabis almost every day since he was 13, knocked DJ Robert Jackson, 43, unconscious with a blow to the head, then wrapped him inside a carpet before stabbing the victim 13 times in the back as he lay motionless inside.

Gasper also stabbed a young girl in the stomach and placed a dog bowl over the dead man’s body before fleeing the house in Moston, Manchester. 

Robert Jackson was beaten and stabbed by his friend Darren Gasper and left with a bowl of dog food on his head after the crazed attack at his Manchester home in July 2013. A 13-year-old girl was also stabbed 

Darren Gasper hijacked a car after the double stabbing and rammed the wall of a pub as well as stabbing himself after being spotted by police, the daily cannabis user was taken to hospital but died shortly afterwards

The inquest heard that Gasper had been a daily cannabis user since he was just 13 and prone to violence 

After the knife attacks, the father-of-one who suffered from 'paranoia induced violence' phoned his ex-girlfriend saying: 'I want to kill myself because I have just killed "Jacko".'

Shortly afterwards Gasper hijacked a car at knifepoint, stabbed himself in the stomach before driving the vehicle into the side of his sister’s pub as he was being approached by a police patrol. 

Officers found the knife lodged in Gasper’s chest and he was pronounced dead in hospital as a result of his self inflicted knife wounds. The girl who cannot be named suffered serious injuries but has since made a recovery.

Jackson nicknamed 'Jacko' was a security guard and a well known DJ at a number of pubs and clubs in Manchester. He was said to be close friends with Happy Mondays star Mark 'Bez' Berry, Stone Roses bassist Gary 'Mani' Mounfield and knew Noel and Liam Gallagher.

Gasper never worked and had been in and out of prison. His ex-girlfriend Simone MacMillan who had a 15 year relationship with him told the Manchester hearing: 'He smoked cannabis almost every day. He used to say that he had enough, was depressed and had no money and was going to kill himself.'

She said in the weeks before the tragedy in July last year Gasper went berserk, threw a microwave and pushed her. In one instance the couple were about to go to bed when Gasper came up to the bedroom sat on the bed and began screaming. 'He then went down and put shoes on,' she said: 'All I could see was evil in him.'.

Miss McMillan fled to a nearby hotel whilst he took her car and crashed it into the nearby Alliance pub. 

The inquest heard that prior to the attack, Gasper had been good friends with Jackson before attacking him in the kitchen on his home. 

Next door neighbour Joy Marshall told the hearing: 'I heard very loud banging so loud it made me jump and my pet animals were scared.' 

Gasper then rang Miss Macmillan telling her to tell their son he loved him and confessing to the killing.

PC Jonathan Pritchley said in a statement: 'Police attended the address and one of the officers looked in the front window and I could see a body partly covered lying on the kitchen floor.

'The door was forced and there also an injured female on the floor in the hallway. The man was lying face-down under a brown rug and he had sustained numerous stab sounds to the back and had severe injuries to the head and face.

'He was lying in a large pool of blood. Paramedics attended and confirmed the male in the kitchen was dead. They began to treat the female in the hallway who was taken to hospital. A search was undertaken of the address and during the search we noticed a large lump hammer on the floor in the hallway leading to the kitchen.

'There was a golf club behind the front door and a knife missing from a knife block on the kitchen unit.'

Police later spotted Gasper in a hijacked Skoda car outside the same pub he had crashed into a week earlier. As four officers approached the vehicle it started to move forward and accelerated quickly into the brick wall of the pub with considerable force.

The inquest heard Mr Jackson was knocked unconscious by the blow to the head before being stabbed

As officers went to the wreckage, Gasper appeared to grimace and appeared to be dazed and slow to react. Then the sergeant noticed the whole of his left side was covered in blood. He died shortly afterwards. Traces of cocaine were found in system but not from recent use.

Det Insp Michael Gladwin who investigated the attack said: 'Robert Jackson and Darren Gasper were friends and Mr Gasper would quite regularly visit Mr Jackson’s house. We still don’t know details of any particular problem between them that led to this incident.

'After examinations we concluded he was assaulted in the area he was found.. There was no indication of movement around the kitchen. There were no signs to suggest a struggle had taken place. The rug had multiple sites of damage consistent with him being stabbed through it. A dog bowl containing dog food was placed on top of the rug.

'At the time Gasper was wanted by the police for criminal damage. He was suffering from paranoia induced violence. The police visited Jackson’s home on July 24 where he said he hadn’t seen Gasper for around two months. Gasper had used cannabis since the age of 13.'

Tests showed the cause of Jackson’s death as being blunt force head injuries and multiple stab wounds. 

Recording a verdict of unlawful killing on Jackson and suicide on Gasper, Coroner Graham Jackson. said: 'Mr Jackson was rendered unconscious by a blow to the head and then stabbed multiple times and wrapped in the rug or blanket and perversely a dog food bowl was placed on top of the body.

'I am satisfied that he was the victim of a most vicious assault. An unlawful act clearly caused the death. I offer my sympathies and condolences to his immediate family. Why all of this happened goodness only knows.'
