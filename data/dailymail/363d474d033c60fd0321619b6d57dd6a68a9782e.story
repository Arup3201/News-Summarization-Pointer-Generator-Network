David Cameron today tore into the Labour party for walking out on talks on English votes for English laws, accusing Ed Miliband of 'not being interested in fairness' for the whole of the UK.

Labour announced it would boycott talks on addressing the English problem, branding government plans 'a closed shop stitch-up'.

It came as a Commons debate got underway on devolving more powers to Scotland in the wake of the independence referendum.

In the days before Scots voted on leaving the UK, Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg published a 'vow' to hand control over more laws and taxes to Scotland.

Hours after the result showed 55 per cent of people rejected independence, Mr Cameron announced that he wanted to also tackle the problem of stopping Scottish MPs voting on laws which only apply to England.

Today Mr Cameron rejected the suggestion that he was playing politics with the Union following the vow made to the people of Scotland during the referendum campaign.

He said: 'What we need is obviously more devolution for Scotland but a settlement that's fair for the whole of the United Kingdom.

'I think it's a matter of great regret if Labour are going to walk out of this Cabinet committee which they could join in and make their suggestions.

'But obviously they are not interested in fairness across the United Kingdom so we will have to work hard with other partners to make sure we deliver.'

Commons leader William Hague today told MPs that devolution of increased powers to Scotland will go ahead as promised, regardless of talks on English votes

Former PM Gordon Brown warned against English votes for English laws

People living in Scotland must be recognised as a minority, Gordon Brown said today as he railed against plans for English vote for English laws.

The former prime minister warned that implementing proposals to devolve income tax to the Scottish Parliament in full and then depriving Scottish MPs of voting on the Budget would be 'absolutely lethal to the constitution'.

The Labour MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath said: 'You cannot have one United Kingdom if you have two separate classes of MPs.'

Mr Brown said the 'fundamental question' affecting the British constitution was not the West Lothian question, which he argued was a symptom of a more fundamental problem about the fair distribution of power.

Speaking during a Commons general debate on devolution following the Scotland referendum, he said: 'The fundamental question in the British constitution is that when you have England 84 per cent of the Union, Scotland 8 per cent of the Union, Wales 5 per cent of the Union, Northern Ireland 3% of the Union... 

'You have the reality that at any point the votes of England could outvote Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland individually or collectively.

'The real fundamental issue, the real issue is a fair distribution of power, that respects not only majority rule - and I am sensitive to the needs of England and to English voters - but also respects the rights of the minorities so that we have stability and we have harmony in the British constitution.'

He said every generation had had to come to terms with 'how you get that balance right between the majority rule and the needs of the minorities that are part of the UK'.

Downing Street has made clear the talks will go ahead without Labour, and said it would be for Ed Miliband's party to explain its absence if it chose not to take part.

Commons leader William Hague has been appointed chairman of a Cabinet committee tasked with drawing up proposals, and he has invited other parties to take part in talks.

But a Labour source has confirmed the party will not take part, saying: 'We need proper reform, not a closed-shop stitch-up in a Cabinet room.'

In the Commons today, Mr Hague warned insensitivity and indifference to the English votes problem is the greatest threat to the Union.

He insisted that the vow of further powers for Holyrood would happen in all circumstances.

But he said increased devolution to Scotland following last month's No vote created an imperative to improve representation and decision making for all parts of the Union.

Mr Hague told MPs: 'I know there are MPs who argue that to address this question is to somehow put the United Kingdom itself at risk, but I say to them the United Kingdom is in greater danger if the legitimate arguments and expectations of English decision making, on decisions effecting only England, are not responded to.

'Insensitivity and indifference is the danger to the union in all nations including in England.'

Speaking during a noisy Commons session, Mr Hague insisted the Cabinet committee he chairs at the request of the Prime Minister was the best way of resolving the immediate questions over England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

And he suggested the Government could be open to a constitutional convention to discuss the wider issues raised by greater devolution to the different nations of the Union, but not on the basis it would delay the immediate discussions and decisions.

Mr Hague criticised Labour for abandoning the committee, adding: 'It has been proposed there should be a constitutional convention to discuss these issues in the future and the Labour Party can come to the Cabinet committee and put that forward - but they seem unwilling to do so.

'Indeed, the Government will consider the proposals for the establishment of such a body on the right terms and at the right time.'

However, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has accused Mr Cameron of already 'reneging' on pledges made during the referendum campaign.

'The Prime Minister started the process of reneging on the commitment when he came out of Downing Street hours after the referendum and said that progress in Scotland should be in tandem with ... constitutional change in England. Even Gordon Brown is finding it difficult to stomach,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

The First Minister also indicated that he did not view another referendum as completely off the agenda.

'What I said was that the referendum was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,' he said.

'My view is that constitutional referendums came along once every political generation - about every 20 years or so.

'Circumstances obviously can change. Clearly, if you had a situation where three leaders made such a public vow - not even a political promise but a vow - in the last few desperate hours when they thought they were losing the referendum campaign and then reneged upon it, then that would obviously be a very, very substantial change of circumstances.

'These matters ultimately are for the people of Scotland to decide. It is for the people of Scotland to decide whether it is satisfactory to be conned and tricked by Westminster leaders, or they will exact a revenge at the ballot box.'
