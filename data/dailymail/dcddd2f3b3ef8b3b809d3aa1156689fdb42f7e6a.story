The government finally released Obamacare enrollment figures Monday and the findings could spell higher premiums for those who need coverage most.

Enrollments are lower for the healthy, younger Americans are needed to keep premiums from rising because they pay more and take less from the system.

According to the statistics, it's an older, costlier crowd that's signing up so far under President Obama's law and officials fear the age gap could make the government subsidized health coverage too costly for the middle-aged and older.

Unexpected: The White House released Obamacare enrollment figures for the first time Monday and numbers show middle aged Americans are signing up the most despite the laws original intend to help cover uninsured young people

The White House reports that middle-aged Americans make up the bulk of the 2 million Obamacare enrollees.

The major targets of the law creating subsidized health insurance were young adults, who are healthy and pay more into the system and take less thus keeping premiums down overall.

However, Monday's report shows that young people are mostly passing on the new, cheaper healthcare.

33 percent of enrollees are aged 55 to 64

22 percent are aged 45 to 54

24 percent were aged 18 to 34

And it’s the middle aged who are, for now, signing up the most.

Adults ages 55-64 were the most heavily represented in the signups, accounting for 33 percent of the total. Overall, the premiums paid by people in that demographic don't fully cover their medical expenses. Some are in the waiting room for Medicare; that coverage starts at age 65.

Young adults from 18 to 34 are only 24 percent of total enrollment, the administration said in its first signup figures broken down for age, gender and other details.

With the HealthCare.gov website now working, the figures cover the more than 2 million Americans who had signed up for government-subsidized private insurance through the end of December in new federal and state markets.

Enrolling young and healthy people is important because they generally pay more into the system than they take out, subsidizing older adults. While 24 percent is not a bad start, say independent experts, it should be closer to 40 percent to help keep premiums down.Some questions remained unanswered.

For example, the administration is unable to say how of many of those enrolling for coverage had been previously uninsured. Some might have been among the more than 4.7 million insured people whose previous policies were cancelled because they didn't meet the law's standards.

‘The uninsured folks for whom the law was intended don't seem to have signed up in nearly as high numbers,’ said Richard Foster, a former statistics chief for the Health and Human Services department. ‘There is still a huge unknown aspect to this.’

US Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius could have a headache on her hands if more young people don't enroll in an Obamacare plan

But even if the age mix remains tilted toward older adults, ‘it's nothing of the sort that would trigger instability in the system,’ said Larry Levitt, an insurance expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Premiums would go up next year for the overhaul, along with taxpayer costs per enrollee, but not enough to push the system into a ‘death spiral’ in which rising premiums discourage healthy people from signing up.

Levitt and other experts expected older, sicker people to be more heavily represented in the early numbers. They would have had strong motivation to persevere in the face of website dysfunction.Still, he said ‘it underscores a need to heighten outreach efforts to young people.’ Adults ages 18-34 represent 40 percent of the target group for the health care law, according to a recent Kaiser study. Open enrollment ends March 31.

Considering that the federal health care website was down most of the time in October, administration officials said they were pleased that the percentage of young adults was as high as it was.

‘We think that more and more young people are going to sign up as time goes by,’ said Gary Cohen, head of the HHS office in charge of Obama's push to cover the uninsured. And there's a hammer, too: Those who fail to sign up face a tax penalty in 2015 for being uninsured.

Making bets: To keep premiums affordable, officials say they need 40 percent of enrollees to be in the 18 to 34 age group

Officials remain confident they'll be able to get young adults interested. Insurers, nonprofit groups, and advocates are moving ahead with marketing campaigns that were put on hold when the federal website that serves 36 states was struggling.

Administration officials said that in the coming weeks they plan to increase outreach to young people

in 25 communities located in states served by the federal website. That effort includes a national youth enrollment day on Feb. 15 and targeted outreach by sororities and fraternities, as well as Voto Latino, which focuses on Hispanic youth.

In Miami, 19-year-old college student Stacy Sylvain was one of the last-minute online signups as 2013 drew to a close. In about an hour, the part-time waitress signed up for a plan with a $158 monthly premium, with the feds kicking in $48. She has a $2,500 deductible. Sylvain said she had no trouble navigating the website.

'Many people have a preconceived notion that young people are healthy and don't need to go to the doctor,' said Sylvain, who suffered a minor injury when she fell and hit her head during an indoor soccer class in 2012. 'Not having to worry about being uninsured and the what-ifs has made an incredible impact on my life.'
