A Los Angeles entertainment anchor confused Samuel L. Jackson with Laurence Fishburne on live TV, making for an incredibly awkward interview.

On KTLA this morning, Sam Rubin asked Jackson, who was appearing on the show from Atlanta to discuss his new movie 'RoboCop,' about his recent Super Bowl commercial.

But the Snakes on a Plane actor didn't do a Super Bowl spot this year - Laurence Fishburne did - and Jackson, understandably, goes off the handle.

Livid, Jackson suggests Rubin is being racist, shouting, 'We don't all look alike,' referring to black actors.

All
 the while, Rubin, who boasts on the KTLA website of being the 
entertainment reporter for the No. 1 morning show in Hollywood, scrambles, 
desperately trying to apologize and jokingly shrug off his offensive 
blunder, but Jackson won't let him.

He genuinely seems like he can't believe what's going on.

The mess begins right at the start of the chat, when Rubin asks, 'Did you get a lot of reaction to that Super Bowl commercial?'

Jackson looks confused and responds 'what Super Bowl commercial?'

The penny immediately drops, and there's a painful silence as a ghost white Rubin stars off screen, probably at a producer, in a desperate plea for help.

But Jackson gets it almost as quickly.

Pointing his finger angrily, he says, 'you see, you're as crazy as the people on Twitter. I'm not Laurence Fishburne!'

Rubin chuckles uncomfortably, repeating, 'that's my fault, I know that, my mistake,' as he holds his hands up in surrender.

But Jackson continues: 'We don't all look alike! We may all be black and famous but we don't all look alike.'

As Rubin continues to backpedal, Jackson asks, baffled: 'You're the entertainment reporter?

'You're the entertainment reporter for this station and you don't know the difference between me and Laurence Fishburne?'

He then quips, 'There must be a very short line for your job.'

Still in disbelief, he exclaims 
'Really? Really?' before lightening the mood slightly by joking about 
the various ads he, Fishburne and even Morgan Freeman have starred in, 
to clarify to the less than qualified entertainment reporter just which 
'black guy' he is.

Angry: Jackson, right, then points his finger angrily at the reporter and says 'you see, you're as crazy as the people on Twitter. I'm not Laurence Fishburne!'

Rubin joined the KTLA Morning News in 1991, according to the station's network.

In that time he's 'established a reputation as someone who goes beyond the entertainment headlines of the day. His insights and exploration of the deeper meaning and impact of the stories within the entertainment industry generate conversation within the business, as well as outside it.'

Perhaps in this case, the conversation he's generating is not the conversation he's after?

KTLA and Sam Rubin have not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment.
