Their feelings for each other led them to break their religious vows, marry and have children.

Now, the remarkable love story of a Franciscan monk and a nun has been revealed by their son.

Comedian John Fugelsang, 45, posted a series of photos documenting his parents'  romance on Twitter on the first anniversary of his father's death.

Relatives: Comedian John Fugelsang (right), 45, tweeted this photo (left) of his late father, saying: 'My father Jack grew up in Flatbush Brooklyn; when he joined the Franciscans his name became Brother Boniface'

Monk: This photo was among a series of tweets about Mr Fugelsang's parents' romance. Its caption read: 'As a Franciscan my dad taught history to Catholic boys & walked among people like the Lost Jedi of Flatbush'

Secret love: Alongside this black-and-white photo, the American comedian and actor wrote: 'My father fell in love with a southern nun who worked as a nurse in bklyn & secretly carried a torch for 10 years'

Devoted to religion: This image, picturing Brother Boniface (left) and a fellow monk, was captioned: 'The nun/nurse he loved was sent to work w/lepers in Malawi; He couldn't reveal feelings but wrote her every week'

Keeping in touch: Meanwhile, this image of Mr Fugelsang's father (centre) was accompanied with the words: 'Every week he'd write Sister Damien in Africa with the news abt America - Dr. King, Civil Rights, Vietnam....'

Too strong a love: 'Eventually his superior in the Franciscan Brothers (left) figured it out & said "If you love her, marry her",' said Mr Fugelsang. 'After 10 years he confessed his love & they married 2 months later (right)'

Accompanied by short captions, they reveal how Jack and Peggy Fugelsang sent each other platonic letters for a staggering 10 years, before eventually breaking their vows to wed.

After finishing high school in Flatbush, Brookyln, Mr Fugelsang's father joined the Franciscan monks, where he became known as 'Brother Boniface' and swore to dedicate his life to God.  

During this time, he taught history to Catholic schoolboys, before falling ill with tuberculosis and meeting his future wife, a nun called 'Sister Damien' who worked as a nurse in Brooklyn.

'From all accounts I heard, he fell madly, desperately, insanely in love with this Southern nurse in a nun's habit that he knew he could never have, and had sworn to God he would never want to have,' Fugelsang told National Public Radio.

Why wait? Mr Fugelsang revealed his parents  thought they should delay the wedding, but his mother's sister told them: 'It's going to be a scandal anyway, so why wait?' Above, his parents on their wedding day

True love: This photo of Mr Fugelsang's father planting a kiss on his new wife's head was captioned: 'At 1st her mom was horrified she'd marry a yankee from brooklyn. 'I won't be able to understand a thing he says'

Wedding: 'They married 2 months after she left the convent. It was a first love, and 2nd marriage, for them both (left),' said the comedian, who has hosted America's Funniest Home Videos. He added: 'For her 16 years of poverty, chastity & obedience the church thanked her with one grey cotton dress & $200 (right)'

Well-wishers: This photo, of the wedding car, was captioned: 'Southern ladies & the northern groom's car'

According to the comedian's tweets, Brother Boniface then held a secret torch for Sister Damien for a decade, expressing his love through platonic letters.

He sent the letters - in which he reported on American politics and events - on a weekly basis to Malawi, where his love had started caring for people with leprosy.

Despite his attempts to keep his feelings hidden, Brother Boniface's Franciscan superior eventually figured them out and unexpectedly told him: 'If you love her, marry her.'

But it was only on Sister Damien's return to Brooklyn following her father's death that the monk left his monastery and showed up at the hospital where she was working, professing his love for her.

Besotted: Mr Fugelsang said that it was his parents' second marriage - their first having been a marriage to God. He captioned the above picture: 'My father the brother & my mother the sister, post-vow breaking'

Happy family: Following the ceremony, Brother Boniface and Sister Damien dropped their religious names, before settling in Bohemia, Long Island, raising children (pictured) and living happily for decades

Bliss: 'I always felt like after I left the clergy & got married my faith actually got deeper,' said Mr Fugelsang, quoting his father. The comedian added: 'I can honestly say that my father's love only grew as he got older'

Taking a turn for the worse: This image, showing Mr Fugelsang's parents embracing, was captioned: 'The week before he turned 70 my dad has his 2nd heart attack & Dr.s said there was nothing they could do'

'She was appalled,' said Mr Fugelsang, who has hosted America's Funniest Home Videos and consulted for comedienne Rosie O'Donnell.

However, Sister Damien was shortly won over and left the convent, before marrying her love in a ceremony at an Army base two months later, during which she wore a knee-length white dress.

In his tweets, Mr Fugelsang reveals his parents initially thought they should delay the wedding, but his mother's sister told them: 'It's going to be a scandal anyway, so why wait?' 

He adds that it was his parents' second marriage - their first having been a marriage to God. 

Frail: 'My Dad heard about a joint Israeli-Thai stem cell treatment in Thailand, using one's own stem cells from blood', said the comedian, tweeting this black-and-white image of his frail-looking father

Smiling: Mr Fugelsang said: 'My Catholic dad put his faith in the Buddhists & the Jews, & traveled to Bangkok b/c he wanted more time with her'. He added that his father said he was 'too in love' with his wife to die

Battling through it together: He said of his father: 'He could no longer walk & my mother took him to Thailand in a wheelchair, for treatment still illegal in the US'. Above, Jack Fugelsang is pictured holding his wife's hand

Staying strong: 'He returned from Stem Cell Treatment still not available in US b/c someone thinks it's against the Bible, I think,' wrote Mr Fugelsang alongside this picture (left) of his smiling father. He added: 'The same love that brought him out of the clergy kept him alive longer than any of the doctors predicted (left)'

Following the ceremony, Brother Boniface and Sister Damien dropped their religious names, before settling in Bohemia, Long Island, raising children and living happily for decades. 

'I can honestly say that my father's love only grew as he got older and as they aged,' said Mr Fugelsang.

'The romance didn't slow down for him at all. He was someone who was completely unable to separate his devotion to God from his devotion to his wife.'

As he reached his late 60s, Mr Fugelsang's father suffered two heart attacks and was told by doctors that there was nothing more they could do.

Affectionate: Following the stem cell treatment, Mr Fugelsang said of his father: 'Within months he was walking again & took my mom on their 1st cruise. This was taken 2 yrs later, in Hollywood'

Having a laugh: This image, which appears to show Mr Fugelsang's father speaking at a family wedding, was captioned: 'C'mon, let Dad speak as part of the ceremony. What's the worst that could happen?'

'The Stem Cell doctors told him he would get a maximum of 2 more years of life from the treatment. He took 5'

However, the pensioner refused to believe them, saying he was 'too in love to die', said his son.

He subsequently underwent a risky stem-cell treatment in Thailand, which allowed him to live happily for a few more years before passing away in August 2010.

Mr Fugelsang, who posted the original tweets in 2012, has also told his parents' love story in a solo performance, Guilt: A Love Story.

New arrival: This photo, depicting Mr Fugelsang's father holding his grandson, was posted with the words: 'The day before he died he got to see his grandson Endy, who gets to live in this world b/c Jack broke a vow to God'

The look of love: Mr Fugelsang, who posted the original tweets in 2012, wrote alongside this image: 'My father died 1 year ago today. This is one of my last photos of him, looking at his wife, and it's my favorite'

Performance: Mr Fugelsang (seen with his father) has also told his parents' love story in Guilt: A Love Story
