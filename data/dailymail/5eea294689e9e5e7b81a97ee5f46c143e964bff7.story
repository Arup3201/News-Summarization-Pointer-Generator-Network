When renowned hard-man Vinnie Jones admits to being taken aback at the levels of violence that Wimbledon team-mate John Fashanu was capable of when they were part of the club’s notorious Crazy Gang in the 1980s, you are not surprised to hear the powerful striker and former host of hit TV show Gladiators was no bleeding heart liberal.

Nevertheless, it is shocking — and doubtlessly refreshing to some — to hear the man once dubbed ‘Fash the Bash’ not only defending his behaviour more than 25 years ago, but also regretting that modern football and society in general has gone soft in a way that prevents people like him ‘rising from the gutter into fame and fortune’, as he puts it.

Fashanu, 52, last week travelled from Nigeria where he is a successful businessman, to London for the premiere of a TV documentary on The Crazy Gang, to be screened on BT Sport on Boxing Day.

It charts the rise of Wimbledon from a non-League club to winning the FA Cup in 1988. Some of the stories are hair-raising. Jones, whose tough-guy reputation saw him forge a Hollywood career, described one dressing-room fight: ‘Fash literally lifted him up, swung him around and smashed him down on the floor and his calf just obliterated.’

Fashanu revels in ruling by fear and admitted: ‘There were times when we were 200 per cent physical. We believed we were warlords because at three o’clock on a Saturday, it was war.’

Former Wimbledon owner Sam Hammam and ex-manager Dave Bassett have condemned the film for focusing on the violence rather than the club’s amazing rise from the Southern League to playing the likes Manchester United and Liverpool.

Fashanu says it is wrong to suggest that Wimbledon were only about bullying but in an exclusive interview with the Mail on Sunday, he refused to apologise for the way he behaved — and for maintaining some strong views that, in today’s society, are very controversial.

Referring to himself in the third person, he describes life at a club he joined from Millwall in 1986.

‘Fash was a physical bastard and you would either have to adapt or dissolve as a person,’ he declares. ‘The players ran the club and if you were a wise manager, you would work with us, not against us.’

Discipline was enforced by kangaroo courts, chaired by Jones and Fashanu, ruling on anything from timekeeping to dress code.

‘The Wimbledon players didn’t have money at that stage, we couldn’t fine you, so the best we could do is beat the crap out of you.

‘That is how we got our success. We are not here to apologise, we are here to tell you how it worked.

‘Once, one of our lads wouldn’t pay a fine, Vinnie and Wisey (Dennis Wise) went to get him, I locked the door of the changing-room and when the door is locked, it is only me, him and God who knows what’s happened. But I assure you, you come out looking different than when you went in.

‘People will now go, “Well, that was too much intimidation”. I’m sorry, in the world we were living in then, it was part of the qualities of leadership, intimidation.’

Dressed in an expensive suit and delighted to be around former team-mates like Dave Beasant, Terry Gibson and John Scales, the gregarious Fashanu does not now carry an air of malice. A former Doctor Barnardo’s boy who was fostered with his brother, Justin, by a Norfolk family, he is proud that the Crazy Gang helped people like him and hod carrier Jones to be successful.

‘Wimbledon was a hard team,’ he says. ‘They were hard boys. We had all come from broken homes, no money, we were the rags-to-riches story. I work on $20 million projects now in Nigeria. It is because of my background at Wimbledon. I was able to come from the gutter to rise to fame and fortune, Vinnie Jones fame and fortune, Dennis Wise fame and fortune.’

Fashanu says the worst crime at Wimbledon was trying to break up a fight on the pitch rather than piling in to support your team-mate. ‘It was about camaraderie. English football is the working man’s game, the Vinnie Jones tackle. We don’t support the Barcelona and Real Madrids, ping-ping-ping.’

Not surprisingly, he is in despair over what he sees as the liberalisation of football — and life, too.

‘On the pitch, we’ve definitely gone soft. It’s got to the extent where there is no physical play. Football is physical, a contact sport.

‘Everything in life has become far too liberal, my good Lord. Anything goes in England now. Try telling your son to go to bed at 12 o’clock. The son will slap your face. You can’t do anything, if my son is sitting there, I’m even scared of him. “Come on son, let’s go”. “I don’t want to go”. “OK, stay there then”. I don’t want to touch him — it’s ridiculous, rubbish. I am from the old school. If he does something wrong, I’ll give him a clip and off we go. That’s how you become a man.

‘What I am saying is what I believe and what everyone else believes but daren’t say. You’re not going to have your 16-year-old daughter coming back with her boyfriend and sleeping in the side bedroom, and allow it. What the hell. That’s liberalisation, I am sorry.’
