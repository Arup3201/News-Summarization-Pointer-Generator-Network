Chequered past: Ashley Blake, 44, lost his job as a presenter on BBC Midlands Today after being convicted of violent wounding

A former BBC presenter turned HGV driver caused rush-hour chaos after trying to squeeze his over-sized lorry through the Dartford Tunnel.

Ashley Blake, 44, said he was as irritated as everyone else until he realised that it was his 17ft-tall double-decker lorry causing the blockage.

The former Watchdog presenter is still getting used to driving HGVs after only qualifying for his licence two weeks ago.

He made the unlikely career change after being fired by the BBC following his conviction for attacking a teenager.

Warning lights were triggered as he approached the tolls during the rush-hour last Wednesday because the 17ft high lorry was too big for the M25 river crossing.

Mr Blake, from Birmingham, said: 'I was coming back to the Midlands from Rochester and it was my first time in that part of the country dragging this oversized vehicle.

'I was just about to enter the tunnel when on the left hand side the matrix signs started flashing like crazy.

'I thought "Oh what an idiot" at whoever was causing the blockage and as soon as that thought entered my mind, I thought "Oh my God, it’s me".'

He explained he was forced to stop and display hazard warning lights.

All the toll booths had to be closed before he could reverse the 46ft long trailer half a mile back from the tunnel.

'It was highly embarrassing,' he said. 'It called upon all of my skills to 
reverse this oversized trailer back half a mile while red-faced.'

Tight squeeze: Blake had only qualified for his HGV driver's licence two weeks before the incident

Mr
Blake took to Facebook to apologise to other road users who had got stuck in the
jam he had caused, stating: 'I’m sorry to all the rush hour commuters.

'The only mitigation I can offer is 
that this is the first time I’ve visited this part of the country in an 
“oversized vehicle"'.

But as expected, Mr Blake experienced the full wrath of the angry motorists who watched him reverse at the time.

He
said: 'Some of the words they were saying are unprintable. I could 
understand that because I used to live in London and I know how annoying
it can be.

'Unfortunately, this time I was the idiot. I confess and seek forgiveness.'

Blake, 44, lost his job as a presenter on BBC Midlands Today after 
being convicted of violent wounding following a fight in a restaurant in
2009.

He was released in June 2010 after serving nine months in prison and took up a new job as a lorry driver.
