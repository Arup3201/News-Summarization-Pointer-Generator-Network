James Milner is set to stay at Manchester City until at least the end of the season.

Liverpool and Arsenal were among the clubs interested in signing the midfielder as he enters the final months of his contract at the Premier League champions.

But the England international is not interested in a short-term deal and Sportsmail understands contract talks will resume next week. 

James Milner is keen to remain at Manchester City and will resume contract talks next week

Milner, who turned 29 last month, is looking for assurances over playing time and length of contract rather than a giant payday.

He is not without admirers at home or abroad but is keen to remain at City should those assurances be forthcoming.

While this season Milner has made 11 first-team starts in the Premier League compared with 12 in the whole of last season, he is under no illusion that the impact of injuries and non-availability of the likes of Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri have helped his cause.

Milner has recently started in his preferred central midfield position and would welcome more opportunities at the same spot.
