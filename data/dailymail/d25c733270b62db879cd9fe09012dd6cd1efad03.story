'I also want to thank the great staff who have shown exceptional patience and guidence over the years.

'Most importantly, I want to express endless gratitude to my team-mates who supported me on and off the pitch, just like my family does.

'Your camaraderie will be forever appreciated, as I've learned so much from you all. I leave Milan with sadness, but know that I will still make you all proud going forward. I'm forever grateful.'
