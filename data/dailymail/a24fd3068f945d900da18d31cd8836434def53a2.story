The son of a wealthy London academic could be jailed for 25 years after he admitted stabbing to death a 22-year-old Czech backpacker in a tent in Costa Rica.

Professor's son Alfred Saunders, 21, stabbed Alexandra Drbohlavova, 22,in the face, neck and chest in a frenzied attack at an idyllic rainforest eco-farm owned by a Briton in December 2011.

It later emerged that Saunders had managed to enter Costa Rica from Nicaragua despite the fact he was the subject of a green Interpol alert describing him as a 'violent individual' likely to commit acts of barbarism.

Frenzied: Alfred Saunders, 21, seen left at the start of his trial in Costa Rica, has now pleaded guilty to the murder of Czech backpacker Alexandra Drbohlavova, 22, right, in a frenzied knife attack in a tent

Dangerous: Saunders, seen outside court in Upala in January 2012, was the subject of an Interpol alert linking him to sex attacks and possession of explosions

Saunders pleaded guilty to murder at a private hearing in Upala after spending 18 months on remand, the Sun reported.

The court was told there was a 'high possibility' Saunders will serve his prison term in a 'maximum security unit'.

After crossing the border from 
Nicaragua the day after Boxing Day 2011, Saunders - the son of King's 
College professor Max Saunders and his former wife, psychoanalyst Catia 
Galatariotou - turned up at the remote farm run by Nic Donati.

Idyllic: Miss Drbohlavova, 22, had been volunteering at the farm in Upala for just two weeks when she was stabbed to death by Saunders

Mr Donati took pity on Saunders, who had almost no possessions, and gave him a tent for the night.

But later that night Saunders had to be overpowered by relatives of Mr Donati alerted by the screams of Miss Drbohlavova.

'Sweet and kind': Miss Drbohlavova, 22, was volunteering at the farm in Costa Rica during her Christmas break from studying at Miami University

The philosophy graduate and volleyball player, who was stabbed 15 times in the face, neck and chest, had been volunteering at the farm for just two weeks when she was attacked.

Friends said she had been pursuing her studies further at Miami University, and had travelled to Costa Rica during her Christmas break to carry out research.

One friend, who described Miss Drbohlavova - nicknamed Sasa - as a 'kind, sweet person', said at the time: 'She was always so calm and peaceful - the horror of this is beyond words.'

Costa Rica's judicial police force told MailOnline after the murder at the end of 2011 that officials became aware Interpol was on Saunders' trail when he entered the country the day after Boxing Day.

Marisel Rodriguez said at the time: 'The man being held over the murder of the Czech woman is the subject of a green Interpol notice.'It's a warning mechanism Interpol uses and makes available to other countries' law enforcement agencies and border control organisations.In Saunders' case, she said, the warning related to 'sex crimes, assault resulting in death, torture or acts of barbarism and the possession of firearms, ammunition or explosives'.

The Interpol notice described Saunders as a violent individual suffering from a mental illness who, as well as being a suicide risk, was liable to commit sexual crimes against minors and could be armed, she explained.
