An 18-year-old student at a Connecticut high school currently is engaged in a battle with the school board over whether her boyfriend will be allowed to accompany her to the school's senior prom. 

The problem: His age - Mikayla Perlotto's boyfriend will be 22 years old, and the school has a policy banning anyone over the age of 20 from attending the prom.

To gain public support, Perlotto - a senior at Torrington High School - wrote a 229-word Facebook post arguing in favor of allowing her soon-to-be-22-year-old boyfriend, Ethan Gleason, to attend the prom on May 23, despite the school's policy.

Too old: 22-year-old Ethan Gleason isn't allowed to go to his 18-year-old girlfriend, Mikayla Perlotto's (both pictured), prom because the school board says he's too old

Honor student: Perlotto is an honor student and has been a member of the school's softball team her entire high school career

On Wednesday, Perlotto and her mother, Donna spoke at a Board of Education meeting, making the case for the district to allow Gleason to attend his girlfriend's prom.

The Board is yet to make a decision, but Superintendent Cheryl Kloczko has agreed to meet with Gleason before deciding on whether he can attend, reports the Register Citizen.

'I don’t have concerns with the person,' Kloczko told the paper. 'I just have concerns with the age. We’d like to meet the 
gentleman.'

The Board has only granted one exception to the rule barring non-students from attending the prom, according to Board Chairman Ken Traub. Other efforts to gain approval for an older date to attend have been shot down.

'You’re putting age groups together that are way too different,' he said. 'I know there’s going to be 15-year-olds there.'

Booze: The school worries that Gleason will buy alcohol for other students, so he said they could search his car and give him a breathalyzer

Perlotto first asked the school's director of secondary education, Eric Baim, who was not swayed by her argument.

Baim tells the paper he and other school officials have 'concerns' about allowing a college student to attend a high school dance.

'There’s a lot of concerns,' Baim said. 'Concerns for everybody.'

Donna Perlotto says she's called Kloczko's office four times to discuss the matter, but never managed to get through to speak with her. So she and her daughter decided to speak at the Board's public comment portion of Wednesday's meeting.

'It’s a mess,' she said. 'I can’t say they don’t care; it’s just we need
 to discuss this — the pros and the cons. It breaks my heart that no one
 is responding.'

Mikayla says that much of Baim's concern was about whether her of-age boyfriend would be purchasing alcohol for other students.

Rules: School Superintendent has agreed to meet with Gleason before she makes her decision

'His rule was that he didn’t want anybody above the age of 20 because of the alcohol,' she said.

Gleason, however - a student at Branford Hall Career Institute - tells the paper that he rarely drinks and wouldn't risk the consequences of supplying minors with alcohol.

'How would I supply a whole school of minors with that?' Gleason said. 'It’s 
not possible. I’m not going to jeopardize myself for some kid who wants 
to manipulate the system.'

He also agreed to meet with Baim to discuss the matter, and says he would even allow a chaperone at the prom to check his car for alcohol and submit to a breathalyzer at the door. 

'At least meet me. Sit down and have a conversation with me,' Gleason added. 'Don’t just judge me because of my age.'

Exception: Torrington High School has only made one exception to its age rule for the prom and denied all other requests

Perlotto says she plans to attend the prom regardless of the Board's decision - she says she's already picked out a dress.

'I haven’t had a chance to see her in it,' Gleason said.

Gleason also says that regardless of the Board's decision, he plans to pick his girlfriend up from her house, take pictures, go out to dinner and then drop her off at the dance. who still plans
 to pick up Perlotto from the house, take pictures, go to dinner and 
drop her off at prom.

Gleason certainly has the approval of his girlfriend's family, and Donna Perlotto said that the school district should trust that she wouldn't let her daughter date a creep.

'We don’t just let our daughter date anybody,' she said. 'But he’s been 
over at for dinner, to family functions, to Easter brunch. He’s part of 
our family. I see the way he talks to her, opening doors for her, He’s 
caring; he’s considerate.'
