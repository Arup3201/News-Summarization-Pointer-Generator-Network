In a speech today Nick Clegg will say Tory infighting over Europe and gay marriage has been an 'unwelcome distraction' which is undermining public support for the Government

Nick Clegg today warned the warring Conservative Party to ‘get back to governing’ – as he insisted the Coalition will continue until the bitter end in 2015.

In a combative speech that will infuriate Conservative MPs, the Deputy Prime Minister said Tory infighting over Europe and gay marriage has been an ‘unwelcome distraction’ which is undermining public support for the Government.

Mr Clegg warned that key Queen’s Speech announcements on issues such as pensions 
and long-term care for the elderly, have been obscured by internal 
‘political punch ups’ in the Tory Party.

Tory MPs are being ‘consumed by game-playing over 
Europe and gay marriage – MPs disappearing into a parliamentary rabbit 
warren, obsessing over this new tactic or that new trick: paving 
legislation, enabling referendums, wrecking amendments’,' he added.

‘Anyone watching 
would be forgiven for asking: what are these politicians doing? So it’s 
time to get back to governing – providing the leadership and focus the 
people of Britain deserve in these difficult times.’

Mr Cameron hinted at the weekend that
he could dissolve the Coalition and try to continue as a minority 
government if relations with the Lib Dems paralyse his administration.

The Prime Minister told Total Politics magazine that despite some ‘frustrations’, the coalition remained the best way to get things done.

‘But if that wasn't the case then we'd have to face the new circumstances in whatever way we should,' he added.

In a speech today Mr Clegg criticised what he called the ‘rather creative coverage’ of those comments.

‘He echoed exactly what both of us have always believed: this Coalition has been remarkably radical; it still has work to do; and the best way for us to serve and improve Britain is by finishing what we started,’ he said.

‘I am absolutely committed to this coalition lasting until 2015 - as is the Prime Minister.’

Claims that it was in either or both parties' interests to ‘prematurely pull the plug’ were wrong.

Voters ‘will not forgive either party if we call time ahead of the election that has been legislated for in 2015 - destabilising the nation in the vague hope of short-term political gain’.

Nor would it work for the Lib Dems to try to ‘pull the wool over people's eyes’ and win back critics of the coalition deal by quitting six months early.

‘And, frankly, that isn't what we want. The Liberal Democrats look forward to fighting the next election as a party of government, on our record in government, and with a distinct vision of our own for the next government - having seen this one through until the end.

An early election would mean ‘destabilising the nation in the vague hope of short-term political gain’.

However the decision to focus on Tory woes comes after Mr Cameron has been rocked by rebellions over gay marriage and Europe in recent days.

Relations with traditionalists worsened at the weekend after reports that the party's co-chairman Lord Feldman said MPs were rebelling because of pressure from 'swivel-eyed loons' in Tory associations. Lord Feldman denies the claims

Relations with traditionalists 
worsened at the weekend after reports that the party’s co-chairman Lord 
Feldman, a close friend of the Prime Minister, said MPs were rebelling 
because of pressure from ‘swivel-eyed loons’ in Tory associations.

Lord
Feldman denies the claims, but Mr Cameron offered an olive branch to 
party members on Monday when he emailed them to say he had a ‘deep and 
lasting friendship’ with the grassroots. He said he would never employ 
anyone who ‘sneered’ at ordinary members.

But
his message was dismissed as ‘too little, too late’ by some activists 
yesterday. Geoffrey Vero, constituency chairman in Education Secretary 
Michael Gove’s Surrey Heath seat, said: ‘Unfortunately, a lot of people 
feel we have been treated with a degree of disdain and contempt.’

And last night, former Tory chairman 
Lord Fowler warned that the party was heading ‘straight for disaster’ 
unless it stopped tearing itself apart.

‘If
you are divided and you look pretty unpleasant as well then you are not
going to win an election,’ he said. The interventions come as David 
Cameron faces more criticism from grassroots activists over his handling
of Europe and gay marriage, and allegations that a key ally described 
party members as ‘mad, swivel-eyed loons’.
