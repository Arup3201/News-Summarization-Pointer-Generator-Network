He is a long way from being Stan Bowles or Matthew Le Tissier or one of the other great mavericks of English football’s colourful past.

But when Jay Emmanuel-Thomas turns up on TV as Bristol City take on West Ham on Sunday, it is a chance for one of the lower division’s larger-than-life characters to strut his stuff.

Bristol City forward Jay Emmanuel-Thomas is a relaxed figure

Whether he is tucking away penalties with the longest, slowest run up you could imagine, or joining his mates on the London music scene, or plugging his fashion line, JET, as he calls himself, is not afraid to be different.

And those penalties? He has scored three of them in League One now and getting on for a million people have looked at them on YouTube.

‘It’s not modelled on anyone just a tactic I have been working on and I’m not one to get put off by people around me,’ he said. ‘I just focus on the keeper and whichever way I decide to choose is the way I go.’

He burst on to the scene with the Arsenal side that won the FA Youth Cup, before making his debut as a teenager. He even made his Champions League bow but soon left the club.

He said: ‘I didn’t want to be that guy to keep coming in and out when people were injured and fit again, so I had to move on.’ 

He went to Ipswich and scored goals before Mick McCarthy took over. Even at Bristol City it has taken time to convince Steve Cotterill of his individual style.

‘I am not fazed about what people think of me, I wear what I want, I do what I want, I will say what I want,’ said Emmanuel-Thomas. ‘If you can’t be yourself at all times then you are never going to know who you really are.

‘On a football pitch when something comes in my head I never think: “I’d better not do that in case I lose the ball”. I am more a person who will think: “If I try that it will work”.’
