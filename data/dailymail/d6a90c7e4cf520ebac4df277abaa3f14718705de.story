It has survived two world wars, but anti-capitalist activists who have set up camp outside St Paul's Cathedral could force it to shuts its doors to the public for the first time in living memory.

On the 379th anniversary of the birth of Sir Christopher Wren,
the cathedral's architect, church authorities 
revealed the house of worship may have to close because of growing 
concerns over the safety of worshippers and tourists.

The cathedral did not even shut its doors during the Second World War and became a symbol of British resistance during the Blitz.

The makeshift camp was inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York which led to other demonstrations all over the world.

Demonstration: The Occupy London Stock Exchange protest is causing a 'risk to the life of the cathedral', cathedral officials have warned

Open on a reduced basis: The cathedral - one of the capital's most popular tourist attractions - has already had to close the restaurant and gift shop

Protest: Demonstrators have set up camp in the square outside St Paul's Cathedral, promising to occupy the site indefinitely

So unusual is the potential closure that
not even staff at St Paul's were able to confirm if or when it had happened before, when asked by MailOnline.

Numbers of protestors who have set up camp as part of the Occupy London Stock Exchange demonstration have been growing since the makeshift protest camp was set up on Saturday.

Church authorities have denied asking protestors to move on from the courtyard, but their ongoing presence has been described as causing a 'risk to the life of the cathedral', a spokesman said.

The cathedral - one of the capital's most popular tourist attractions - has already had to close the restaurant and gift shop and the number of visitors has fallen since protesters' arrival on Saturday.

St Paul's has been supportive of the Occupy movement, however in a statement released by the cathedral, a spokesman said: 'St Paul's Cathedral stated 
on Monday that it was still trying to provide worship and welcome to all
in spite of the presence of the protest camp in the churchyard.

'St
Paul's asked everyone to respect this need and to acknowledge the risk 
to the life of the cathedral posed by the current situation. The 
cathedral has managed so far to remain open on a reduced basis.

Iconic: This image of St Paul's during the Blitz has become a symbol of survival... but the house of worship could face temporary closure due to the growing number of protestors

'The
increased scale and nature of the protest camp is such that to act 
safely and responsibly the cathedral must now review the extent to which
it can remain open for the many thousands coming this week as 
worshippers, visitors and in school parties.

'Is it now time for the protest camp to leave? The consequences of a decision to close St Paul's cannot be taken lightly.'

A
few days ago Rev Dr Giles Fraser, Canon Chancellor of St Paul's 
Cathedral, said that while he had not given his specific backing to the 
occupation of St Paul's Churchyard, he supported the democratic right to
protest.

However, as the 
days draw on and more protesters have arrived at the site, it appears 
the cathedral's authorities have had a change of heart.
