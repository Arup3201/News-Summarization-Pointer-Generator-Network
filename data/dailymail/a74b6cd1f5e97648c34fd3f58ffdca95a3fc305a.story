The support of a crowd can spur a team on to win and with fans like these in your corner, France could have little excuses for drawing 0-0 with 10-man Ecuador.

The wives and girlfriends turned out in force to watch their men take on Ecuador in the Group E finale, and looked ready to take to the pitch themselves as they donned their blue and white colours.

The wives of Yohan Cabaye, Loic Remy, Mamadou Sakho, Bacary Sagna and Patrice Evra didn't look too worried pre-match, though, as the five posed for photographs ahead of the stalemate.

France sailed through Group E with little problems, particularly after Antonio Valencia was sent off for Ecuador, but could not find the winner.

They knew their status in the final 16 was as good as finalised, though, thanks to their superior goal difference over their opponents.

France topped their group with seven points after wins over Switzerland and Honduras got the job all but done, and will face Nigeria on June 30.
