Geoffrey Boycott believes an England comeback for Kevin Pietersen is a non-starter because captain Alastair Cook 'can't handle' him.

Pietersen's colourful international career was effectively ended in February when the England and Wales Cricket Board dropped its record run-scorer and effectively sacked him from his central contract.

Entrenched opinions on both sides mean reconciliation is highly unlikely, while the publication of Pietersen's eagerly anticipated autobiography next month, when a mutually agreed confidentiality clause expires, should settle the matter once and for all.

Boycott, himself a former England skiper, agrees there is no way back but suggests one of the key reasons is an inability from Cook to manage his one-time star batsman.

Boycott told Radio Five Live: 'They won't consider him again, they won't go back. Whether that's right or wrong I dont know but they're not going to go back, they've made a decision.

'Too many people just feel we don't need it, we don't need the difficulty.

'They know they have enough problems, they don't want any more problems.

'Keeping somebody like Kev, who can give you match-winning performances but can give you headaches, you need a captain who can handle that.

Cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott claims Cook does not know how to handle Pietersen

'I'm almost sure in my own mind the current captain can't. Alastair's a nice lad, you couldn't say anything bad about him...but I don't think he can handle someone like Kevin.

'It takes a strong personality and I don't think he is.

'(He's) strong in batting, not strong in handling people.'

Boycott's fellow Test Match Special commentator Michael Vaughan had a trouble-free relationship with Pietersen when he captained England.

Boycott believes that former captain Michael Vaughan (R) would have dealt with Pietersen better

That may have been down to getting the player at the right stage of his career, but Boycott believes he would have dealt with Pietersen better than his latter-day predecessors.

'Michael Vaughan got him at the beginning of his career, it was was much easier because he hadn't become such a big figure in cricket,' added Boycott.

'Michael, if he'd have been captain later on when Kevin became a star, I think would have handled him better because he was a very good captain, an excellent captain.'
