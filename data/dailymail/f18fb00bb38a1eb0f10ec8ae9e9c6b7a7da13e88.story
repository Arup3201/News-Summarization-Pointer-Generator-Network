 A former AFL player, his brother and a man with suspected bikie links have been charged with stealing almost $300,000 at gunpoint from a cash delivery van in Melbourne.

The men were among five people charged with armed robbery after police raided 10 Melbourne properties on Tuesday.

Police allege they found $6000 cash secreted in a dishwasher and a hidden sawn-off bolt action rifle, as well as what's believed to be ice and cannabis at the Point Cook home where former West Coast rookie Ben Sharp lives with his parents.

Sharp, 28, was drafted to the Eagles in 2005 and was reportedly mates with fallen football star Ben Cousins.

Sharp, his 23-year-old brother Christopher Sharp and another man, Nathan Lack, are accused of robbing the cash delivery van at gunpoint on December 1, 2014, while it moved money from a Sunbury McDonald's restaurant.

The trio, who police allege all use ice, were remanded in custody after appearing in an out-of-sessions court hearing on Tuesday night.

Police say a car, allegedly stolen by Ben Sharp, was used when the men robbed the van of more than $287,000 by approaching the guard armed with two different guns.

The car was later torched, Detective Senior Constable Ross Adams said.

Ben Sharp has also been charged with trafficking ice, as has 33-year-old Tarneit man Lack.

Sharp told the hearing he didn't know anything about the robbery, the involvement of the allegedly stolen car or the drugs police allege were found in the raid, but did admit to using ice.

He said he ran a scaffolding business, but hadn't really worked since April.

Another police officer told the hearing Lack posted about $100,000 worth of ice to a fake person in WA.

She also alleged Lack had associations with WA-based outlaw motorcycle gangs.

The hearing was told the cash delivery van guard was unarmed and had only started his job two weeks prior to the hold-up.

He was on his last pick-up of the night when he was approached.

Two other men have also been charged over unrelated armed robberies and remanded in custody after the raids in western Melbourne, while a further five were released.

All five men will appear in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Wednesday.
