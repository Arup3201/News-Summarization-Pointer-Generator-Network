Actress Salma Hayek and husband Francois-Henri Pinault who are moving to London because it is 'cosmopolitan'

Hollywood star Salma Hayek and her billionaire French husband are moving to Britain. 

François-Henri Pinault, France’s third richest man, is relocating his family to London. 

Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, a luxury goods group, has an estimated fortune of £9 billion. 

The capital has recently become a popular destination for wealthy French, who are seeking to avoid a 75 per cent supertax introduced by increasingly unpopular Socialist President François Hollande. 

But despite the recent exodus of millionaires from France, Ms Hayek insisted that her family were moving to London for career reasons and not for tax purposes.   

Mr Pinault, 51, will still contribute to the French exchequer as his company is based in Paris. 

Speaking about the move in an interview with The Times Magazine, the actress said: ‘I want to clarify, it’s not for tax purposes. We are still paying taxes here in France.  

‘We think that London has a lot more to offer than just a better tax situation.

‘François thinks London is very cosmopolitan. I think it will be good for my career too.’

Hayek's billionaire husband has been keen to move to the city. Pinault has called it 'cosmopolitan', and his family owns shares in several London based companies

Kering, a family company, owns several fashion houses including Alexander McQueen, Gucci and Stella McCartney. 

French actor Gerard Depardieu has maintained duel citizenship with Russia, but claims that he is still a financial citizen in France

It has been claimed that London has become the sixth largest ‘French city’ in the world, with more than 300,000 French people living there.

It is not clear where the Pinaults have chosen to live but they are believed to be moving to a rented house in West London. 

Ugly Betty star Ms Hayek, 47, who married Mr Pinault in 2009, added: ‘I’m going to install special light bulbs at home, so I can have sunlight all the time.’ 

The Mexican actress said that the couple were having difficulty finding the right school for their six-year-old daughter, Valentina. 

She said: ‘They [the school] want to put her one year behind, because she was born in September, and I disagree with the system. 

‘As good as the schools are, if they don’t recognise how special my child is - she speaks three languages and understands five - then they’re not that good, are they?’  

Prolific French actor Gerard Depardieu, was granted Russian citizenship in January last year and Bernard Arnault, another fashion tycoon, is seeking Belgian residency, although he claims he will remain ‘fiscally domiciled’ in France.
