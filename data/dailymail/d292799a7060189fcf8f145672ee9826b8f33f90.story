Bob Geldof has spoken of how he wants his grandchildren to grow up away from the 'soap opera' of his family.

The Boomtown Rats singer made the admission in his first TV interview since his daughter Peaches died in April, leaving her two young sons Astala and Phaedra - who were aged 11 months and 23 months - without a mother.

In the moving conversation, the 62-year-old told how he still breaks down uncontrollably three months after his daughter's death, finding the emotional weight 'intolerable'.

But he said the tragic circumstances could also now provide a chance for his grandchildren to live their own lives, untouched by his celebrity status.

Emotional: At one point the singer bowed his head as he talked about the death of his daughter aged 25

'For 40 years, for good or 
ill, the family has been part of the national soap opera and I never 
expected that, and a lot of people think they know us and in some ways 
they do know parts of us,' he told ITV's Lorraine Kelly.

'My life has also seemed incredibly episodic, like a soap opera.'

He
 continued: 'They're so small the little chaps and I'm not sure that 
they'll have this craving to remember their mum and I think that's 
healthy.

'You know, they're 
young enough - it's a terrible expression - to be able to build 
emotional relationships away from the primary relationship with the 
mother.

'I know that sounds 
very cold and empirical but obviously I've had to think about it and so 
have Tom, their dad, and Keith and Sue, their grandparents, who are 
amazing people and doing fantastically with the guys.

'So
 I don't want them becoming wrapped up in the Geldof life. It's great in
 some respects, it's appalling in other times and things.'

The singer spoke almost three months to the day since Miss Geldof was found unconscious at her home in Wrotham, Kent, on April 7.

Father and daughter: Bob Geldof and Peaches. He said he was amazed by the impact she had on her generation

Emotional: The singer shared a hug with ITV's Lorraine Kelly almost three months to the day since Miss Geldof was found unconscious at her home in Wrotham, Kent, on April 7. He is devoting himself to his music

He said he coped through his music but he and his family were still struggling.

'There's not many options,' he said. 'It's
 intolerable, it's very hard as, everybody must realise if it's happened
 to them too. What else do you do? You get on with it.'

The 62-year-old said he escapes the thoughts of Peaches' death through music, but this could also bring out his darkest emotions.

'Being
 on stage is entirely cathartic,' he said. 'It just clears your head... 
When I come off stage I'm physically exhausted and mentally clear.'

The singer, whose first wife Paula Yates died of a heroin overdose in 2000, added: 'If I dwell on the words sometimes I find it hard to struggle
 through the song because they take on whole meanings I never meant when
 I wrote them.'

Speaking of 
the Rats' No 13 single Diamond Smiles, he said: 'I was writing about a 
girl I read about in one of the papers, a socialite, and she went to a 
posh party and went upstairs and she hanged herself during the party.

Opening up: The Boomtown Rats singer, whose appearance was timed with the launch of a comeback tour, talked about how songs he had written decades ago had taken on new meanings he never imagined

'These things assault you without warning,' the Boomtown Rats singer said. 'You could be talking to someone, you could be walking down the road, and I have got to be very careful because this is still very raw'

'I think somebody said she was the brightest of diamonds and I called the song Diamond Smiles.

'If
 I really think about those words it's too bizarre, it's too telling, 
about whether it's about Paula or - now - what it's about Peaches.' 

'The default position for me as a person is right, things have to be organised, and that distracts me,' the singer continued.

'But
 like anybody else these things assault you without warning. You could 
be talking to someone, you could be walking down the road, and I have 
got to be very careful because this is still very raw.

'Like anybody else these things assault you without warning. You could 
be talking to someone, you could be walking down the road, and I have 
got to be very careful because this is still very raw'

'I'm
 walking down the road and suddenly out of the blue there's an awareness
 of her and I buckle, and I've got to be very careful because walking 
down the King's Road there's paps everywhere so I have to duck into a 
lane and blub for a while.

'I don't want this to be a blub fest but you can imagine it.'

However, the Irish singer said he had been humbled by the public's support.

'We were overwhelmed by people writing
 to us in the kindest way,' he said.

'Complete strangers but who felt it and the 
nice thing about that was this young girl had made such an impact, 
especially on her generation.

'I
 was talking in Leeds and some people came up to me and said "you're 
Peaches Geldof's dad, aren't you?". But I liked it, I liked being 
Peaches Geldof's dad.'

Of 
his proposal to his long-term girlfriend Jeanne Marine just a month 
after his daughter's death, he said: 'I was going to do it anyway on her
 birthday - I love her to bits and she's amazing and I certainly 
wouldn't have got through the last 20 years without her.'

He
 thought of postponing the proposal, he said, but: 'Then I thought no, 
we need to let some air into the room, we need to let some light in.'

Tragic: Peaches, pictured with her children and husband Tom Cohen, worried she would echo her mother's fate

Performing with The Boomtown Rats, he played at he Volksfest Festival in Plymouth, Devon, almost two months after she died.

Miss
 Geldof was close to her father and after her death, he was the first 
family member to make a statement about their loss, expressing his 
devastation and disbelief.

‘Peaches
 has died. We are beyond pain,' Geldof wrote. 'She was the wildest, 
funniest, cleverest, wittiest and the most bonkers of all of us.

‘Writing
 “was” destroys me afresh. What a beautiful child. How is this possible 
that we will not see her again? How is that bearable?’

Smiling through it all: Despite the grim subject of the interview, the presenter remarked on how well the singer looked, cracking a handful of jokes in the studio as he looked forward to going back on tour

Miss Geldof was found unconscious at her home in Wrotham, Kent, on April 7 after taking heroin.

An inquest hearing was told the drug was a likely cause of her death.

In what is thought to have been her last interview before her death, she spoke of her fears that she would die like her mother Paula Yates, who died of a heroin overdose in 2000.

She told the American writer William Todd Schultz: ‘It’s like I’m someone in a book. Your life, they keep telling you, is preordained, “I’m going to die like my mother ... she’s going to end up like her mother”.’

Geldof's interview took place as he prepared to launch a major comeback tour by the Boomtown Rats - who he first 
led on stage 39 years ago.

The band will tour 15 venues through 
England and Scotland in October and November, with tickets having gone on sale at 9am today.
