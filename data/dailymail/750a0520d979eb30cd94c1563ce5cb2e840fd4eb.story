There was widespread outrage among UEFA delegates at their meeting ahead of the FIFA Congress when the £16million outlay on Sepp Blatter’s vanity project film was discussed.

The European representatives were aghast that Blatter should commit so much money — more than the annual turnover of most of UEFA’s national associations — to the FIFA history film United Passions, which was launched at the Cannes Film Festival last month.

When Sports Agenda first revealed the sum Blatter had agreed to put into the project — against staff advice — Zurich claimed the true figure was far lower.

But financial director Markus Kattner, who rubber stamped the decision without the knowledge of a number of FIFA executive committee members, confirmed it was £16m this week.

Kattner added that it was agreed at the 2009 Congress and included in FIFA’s 2010 financial report as a World Cup budget entry.

But it is understandable that representatives from FIFA’s main decision-making committee knew nothing about this increasingly murky affair when their independent audit overseer Domenico Scala acknowledged it was a ‘single line entry’ without a purpose being specified.

FIFA will have to spend upwards of £1million on sending blood and urine samples from World Cup drugs tests to Switzerland after Rio’s poorly-equipped laboratory had its accreditation removed.

World Anti-Doping Agency president Sir Craig Reedie will hold talks in Rio on Saturday to make sure preparations for a new lab for the 2016 Olympics are on course.

Brazil Games chief Carlos Nuzman has invited Reedie to dinner, making sure it did not clash with the England game. Craig pointed out it would not be a problem as he is Scottish.

Sepp Blatter has easily seen off all challengers to his FIFA presidency but UEFA chief Michel Platini is playing a canny game.

Platini, whose FIFA election contention has shifted from definitely not to maybe, is wisely keeping options open to see how far Blatter’s reputation is tarnished from the Qatar scandal and the fall-out from Brazil’s shambolic World Cup preparation.

Meanwhile, the criticism by David Gill, who rarely speaks in public, of Blatter’s ridiculous claims of racism against the British press is seen as a clear sign of him emerging as a candidate to be the next UEFA president.

Both the BBC and ITV will have backdrops of Copacabana Beach and Sugarloaf Mountain from their purpose-built Rio broadcasting positions.

The BBC facilities are bigger and no wonder, as they have sent 272 personnel to Brazil compared to ITV’s 123.

Meanwhile, Sky Sports administrator Brendan Henry is considering bringing home two of Sky Sports News’s four crews in Brazil after FIFA barred non rights holders from pre-match access to World Cup stadiums.

Delayed: England's journey from their hotel to the training base is becoming a nightmare

England’s journey from their hotel to their training base must be causing concern.

First predicted to take 20 minutes, the eight-mile trip initially took 39 minutes, then 45 and on Wednesday lasted 55 minutes, with the extra delays blamed on protests on the Copacabana.

There have been no signs of the priority lanes promised to the FA, while there is no chance of a rebellious Rio public observing the Olympic lanes that must be installed for the 2016 Games. A 2016 spokesman said lane details were under discussion.

Things are no better in Sao Paulo, where FIFA executive committee members endured four-hour journeys from the airport and saw delegates bussed in at 7am yesterday to avoid the traffic chaos.

Perhaps they may now be looking forward to the World Cup in Qatar, where all stadiums are in a 75-mile radius.

Charm offensive: James Milner and team-mate Phil Jagielka have met fans

It may all go pear-shaped in Manaus on Friday, but the FA charm offensive has continued through the week in Miami and up to the eve of the team travelling to the Amazon city, with England players Phil Jagielka and James Milner staging a meet and greet with fans at a hotel near the team’s Royal Tulip base.
