A man who was livestreaming videos of the Ferguson protests had his phone stolen on-camera on Monday night, the the thief unknowingly running away while still filming.

Vlogger Baseem Masri was streaming images of the events to almost 100,000 people from his mobile phone when it was stolen.

Masri was filming the many cars and businesses that were set alight in the aftermath of a Grand Jury decision not to charge police officer Darren Wilson over the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in August.

Stolen: Videographer Baseem Masri, seen here in a picture from his Twitter, had his phone stolen on camera

At one point during Masri's video, an unknown man suddenly grabs his phone and takes off down the street.

For about one minute viewers can hear the man huffing and puffing as he runs away with the phone in his hand.

The footage was broadcast live to 90,000 people, Masri later said on Twitter.

Unfortunately a clear shot of the thug was not captured in the footage.

Masri wrote on his Twitter that, despite his phone being stolen and the protests, he was 'safe'.

'Unfortunately our way of life is once again under siege, and the innocent are being caught in the middle,' he wrote separately on Tumblr.

'Civilians, young and old, are taking precautions to ensure the safety of their property and their loved ones.'
