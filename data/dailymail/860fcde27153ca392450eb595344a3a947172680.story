The sheer scale of worklessness in Britain was laid bare today as one in three households in some cities are completely jobless.

Liverpool has the highest rate for the fourth year running with more than 50,000 homes in this dire situation, and some contain families who have never worked a day in their lives.

Experts say that former industrial areas of the UK have hundreds of thousands of households with generations of people who have been out of work for up to 40 years.

Best and worst: New figures have shown the scale of unemployed households in some areas of Britain

Official figures released by the Office for National Statistics paint a depressing regional picture, with communities in the north-east, Wales, Scotland and parts of London having the largest number of completely unemployed homes.

In Liverpool homes, with someone aged between 16 and 64, 31.6 per cent of them were completely workless in 2011.

South Teesside, which includes Middlesborough and Redcar, had a 29.1 per cent rate - the second highest 
percentage - up from a ranking of fourth a year 
earlier.

The highest percentage of workless households in Wales was in the 
Central Valleys, and this area was the third highest across the UK, where 28.7 per cent of 
households were workless.

Deprived: Liverpool is one of the poorest areas of Britain and has consistently had the highest unemployed household rates

Glasgow topped in Scotland and has the fourth highest rate in Britain at 28.7 per 
cent, followed by Sunderland, which completed the top five.

The main reasons given by people was long term sickness, disability or just not being able to get a job.

'The common link among the areas within the top five is that they were 
all heavily industrialised in the last century,' the ONS said today,

'Liverpool had a large 
manufacturing base and one of the UK’s largest docks, which have both 
been in decline since the 1970s. South Teesside has also seen a decline 
in the heavy industries that dominated the area in the last century. The
Central Valleys were once one of the UK’s largest coal producers, most 
of which no longer exists.

'Glasgow was once a major force in 
shipbuilding as well as other engineering but competition overseas has 
seen that decline since the 1960s. Finally Sunderland was also affected 
by the loss of shipbuilding and coal mining as seen is some of the other
areas.'

Up and down: This official graph shows how areas with historic levels of worklessness have fared over the years and where they were ranked up to 2011

In 2011, the lowest percentage of workless households in the UK were mainly 
concentrated in the south of England.

Oxfordshire had the lowest percentage, at eight per cent followed by 
Buckinghamshire, on 9.8 per cent.

Both these areas have commonly had low
rates of workless households since records began in 2004.

East Cumbria 
was the area with the third lowest workless households in 2011 at 10.9 
per cent.

Shock: Britain's dole queue is dropping slowly but there is a worrying number of households where none of the residents have ever had a job

Official Government figures 
released last week show the number of households where there are no people 
in employment, including those who have worked previously, has gone down
by 0.8 per cent.

The 
Office for National Statistics (ONS) said this was 3.7 million in 2012 -
down 153,000 on a year earlier. But it is still higher than the 
pre-recession level of 3.4 million.

340,000 contain whole families who have never had a job in their lives.
