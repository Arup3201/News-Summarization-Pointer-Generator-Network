A pair of teenagers who raided a newsagents and were caught after posting pictures of their loot on Facebook just three minutes after the robbery took place have been sentenced to three years in a young offenders' institute.

Reece Winfield, 18, and Corey Hobson, 17, took photographs of the cigarettes and alcohol they stole from the shop in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, just 500 yards from the scene of the crime on February 5.

Winfield also posted an image of Hobson's bloodied finger which he had injured in the robbery and when a friend posted a link to an online article on a local news website about the raid, Hobson commented: 'Hehehe that's me.'

When the pair were arrested two days later, detectives were able to further link them to the crime because they were still wearing the same underwear as when the raid took place.

Although that hapless duo's faces were obscured in CCTV footage taken from the shop, the waste bands of their underwear was clearly visible because of their low slung trousers.

The teenagers were sentenced to 32 months for the robbery and four months each for another offence of attempted arson which emerged during the investigation into the robbery.

A judge at Nottingham Crown Court also ordered the pair to pay Â£120 each in compensation to the newsagent who received minor injuries and was left shaken by the incident.

Both had pleaded guilty.

Detective Sergeant Phil Sims, of Mansfield CID, said: 'These two made it very easy for us to track them down and, in the end, you could say they were well and truly caught with their pants down.

'They obviously thought it was funny to brag about their crime, sparing no thought for their victim, who they left battered and bruised and counting the cost of their theft and damage.'

The pair also pleaded guilty to attempted arson after they filmed themselves lighting and throwing a home made petrol bomb into a Nottingham street two days before the newsagent robbery took place.

Officers investigating the robbery found the video on Winfield's phone while investigating the raid.

Inspector Andy Goodall said: 'While there was no damage or injuries caused by the explosion, Winfield and Hobson's actions showed a reckless disregard for their own and other people's safety.

'The fact that they filmed their exploits and laughed at the bang suggests they were pretty happy with themselves.

'I doubt they are laughing now.

'It is by no means big or clever to play with fire and certainly not risk the lives of others. Under no circumstances will we tolerate this sort of lawless, dangerous behaviour.'

Hearing: The pair were jailed for an additional four months at Nottingham Crown Court for attempted arson after another offence emerged during the investigation into the robbery
