A Canadian family whose 17-year-old son was knocked off his bike and killed in 2012 were shocked to discover the driver who hit him plans to sue for $1.35 million.

Brandon Majewski had been cycling along a road near his Alcona home with two friends when Sharlene Simon hit them with her SUV, injuring two of them and killing Brandon.

Now the 42-year-old is suing Brandon's estate and the 16-year-olds she injured over claims she has suffered emotional trauma, and alleging that the friends were negligent.

Loss: Brandon Majewski died after a driver knocked into his bike in October 2012

Tragic: Floral tributes and a bike have been left at the spot where Brandon was knocked off his bike and killed

The mother-of-three ran into the back of the friends at about 1.30am on October 28, 2012, as they returning home from a coffee shop.

She is seeking damages from Brandon's parents, Derek Majewski  and Venetta Mlynczyk, as well as from Richard McLean, who broke his pelvis after being hit by her car, and Jake Roberts, who was also knocked from his bike.

The county where the crash happened is also named in the lawsuit for allegedly failing to maintain the road.

According to the lawsuit filed at an Ontario court in December, Ms Simon 'sustained and will sustain great pain and suffering her enjoyment of life has been and will be lessened'.

'I’m devastated, I’m in shock,' Ms Mlynczyk told the Toronto Sun. 'She killed my child and now she wants to profit from it? She
 says she’s in pain?

'Tell her to look inside my head and she will see 
pain, she will see panic, she will see nightmares.'

The family's lawyer was also shocked by the lawsuit, and said he was so upset by it he couldn't bear to tell the parents over the phone.

Shocking: The driver who ran into Brandon's bike is suing his family for 'emotional trauma'

'I have never seen anyone ever sue a 
child that they killed. It’s beyond 
the pale. I just couldn’t bring myself to tell them,' Brian Cameron said.

In the claim, Simon has asked for $1.35 million in damages for the psychological suffering, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress she says she has suffered since the accident.

She alleged that the friends had been negligent, claiming: 'They did not apply their brakes properly. They were incompetent bicyclists.'

Her lawyer, Michael Ellis, told Mail Online: 'Ms Simon empathizes with families of the young cyclists for the losses they have sustained as a result of the accident, but she too has been harmed by this event.

'She relives the terror of this incident every day,' he added, explaining that Ms Simon has been unable to return to work since the collision and had post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosed.

'Unfortunately, the cyclists were not riding in a careful and prudent manner. They were riding in the middle of an unlit road at 1:30am,' Mr Ellis said.

'Their bicycles were not properly illuminated, nor did they have the proper reflectors. An independent accident reconstruction completed by law enforcement officials found that there was nothing Ms  Simon could have done to avoid the collision.'

He added: 'While everyone should feel sympathy and compassion for the families of the cyclists, we must also remember that there is another family who is hurting as well.'

Brandon's father rejects the notion that his son had been negligent, saying: 'They're kids. They have the right to make mistakes.'

He added that the bikes all were fitted with reflectors that would have been visible.

Claims: The driver has alleged the boys she ran into were 'negligent'. As well as suing Brandon's family, she is seeking damages from the teenagers she injured as well

Traumatic: Six months after Brandon died his older brother Devon, pictured with their mother Venetta, was found dead at their home

Ms Simon's
 demands have further compounded the grief for Brandon's family, who are
 also mourning the loss of his older brother who died a few months after
 the accident.

Six
 months after Brandon died, the family awoke to find his 23-year-old 
brother Devon dead in bed. He had died after taking pills and drinking 
alcohol.

'This
 has ripped our family apart,' Mr Majewski said 'And now this woman has 
the gall to try to profit from our dead child she killed? Profit from 
another boy who was almost crippled?'

Family lawyer Mr Cameron has made a routine lawsuit against Ms Simon to recoup medical 
and funeral costs on behalf of the victims and their families.

He alleges 
Simon was speeding and may have been intoxicated and talking on her 
cellphone. A police report showed she was going at 90km per hour in an 80 zone.

'Sharlene
 Simon failed to take reasonable care to avoid a collision which she saw
 or should have seen was likely to occur,' his claim states. 'She 
operated the motor vehicle while she was intoxicated.'

None of the allegations have been tested in court. Ms Simon was not breathalyzed at the scene.
