A man on board a Ryanair flight was arrested after he allegedly claimed he had bombs, threw lit cigarettes around the cabin and assaulted a fellow passenger.

The drama was only halted when a group of men tackled the passenger from hell and restrained him until the plane landed at East Midlands Airport on Wednesday.

The flight was returning from Malaga. Once grounded the man was met by Leicestershire Police and charged with common assault, being drunk while on an aircraft and smoking on an aircraft, and is due to appear in court in November.

Hazel Hickson, Sue Snodin, Paula Ball and Nicola Ball with Kian Ball, 10 months and Harry Hickson were shaken by the actions of a man on board their Ryanair flight into East Midlands, who has since been charged

Hazel Hickson, 53, of Groby, who was returning from a five-day trip to Malaga with friends and her 12-year-old son, Harry, said: 'Ten minutes into the flight he was making strange noises.

'I first thought he might have learning difficulties, but then a couple sat close to him asked to be moved. 

'He then stood up and said he could take the plane down, and somebody else said he heard him say he had three bombs.

'At one stage a big guy came over but the man's behaviour became worse. 

'He then started either verbally or physically abusing an elderly lady in front of him and, when her husband told him to stop, he punched him in the eye, breaking his glasses and making him bleed.

'At that point a group of seven or eight guys jumped on him and dragged him into the aisle.

'It turned into a brawl - one was punching him and another said 'we're taking control'.

'An air stewardess burst into tears. The men took him to the back of the aircraft and sat on him for 20 minutes until we landed, and it was the first time in the flight I felt safe.

'If the men hadn't taken control, I think someone else would have got hurt.. It was unbelievable.'

The man reportedly started to light cigarettes on board the flight, with Ms Hickson adding that the cabin crew seemed not to know what to do.

After being tackled by other irate passengers, the man was pinned down at the back of the aircraft, with the staff said to be visibly upset at the incident.

Sue Snodin, 56, from Leicester was travelling with her son's partner Nicola and 10-month-old grandson Kian.

The budget airline is clear in its terms and conditions about how it expects passengers to behave.

'If, in our reasonable opinion, you conduct yourself aboard the aircraft so as to endanger the aircraft or any person or property on board, obstruct the crew in the performance of their duties, or fail to comply with any instructions of the crew including but not limited to those with respect to smoking, alcohol or drug consumption, behave in a manner which we reasonably believe may cause or does cause discomfort, inconvenience, damage or injury to other passengers or the crew, we may take such measures as we deem reasonably necessary to prevent continuation of such conduct, including restraint. 

You may be disembarked and refused onward carriage at any point, and may be prosecuted for offences committed on board the aircraft.'

Sue said: 'The man started five minutes into the flight, he was shouting and obviously upset, I thought he was on drink or drugs. He lit cigarettes and threw them down the plane.

'I felt the staff were not equipped to deal with the incident and we had to endure a two-and-a-half hour flight from hell. There was a young stewardess trying to deal with him, but she was getting really upset.

'When it was all over, the pilot came out of the cockpit, wiped his brow and asked if he had been removed, but there was no apology, nothing.

'I am putting a complaint into Ryanair.'

A Ryanair spokesman said: 'The crew of this flight from Malaga to East Midlands requested police assistance on arrival after a passenger became disruptive.

'The aircraft landed normally and police removed and detained this passenger. Ryanair sincerely apologise to other customers for any inconvenience suffered on this flight. It is now a matter for Leicestershire police.'
