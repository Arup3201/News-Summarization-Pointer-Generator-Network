Witnesses say that there's a woman to blame after a fight broke out in front of a Nashville Margaritaville.

Sommer Trent, 33, was arrested early Sunday morning after police say she tried to choke her husband because he wouldn't buy her a hat.

According to the Charleston Daily Mail, Trent and her husband Jeff West were visiting from West Virginia to see the Tennessee Titans game against the Dallas Cowboys.

Trouble in paradise: Sommer Trent, 33, was in Nashville with her husband Jeff West, 41, when she allegedly assaulted him because he wouldn't buy her a hat

Trent had to miss the game because she was in lockup in Davidson County.

Police responded to the scene in downtown Nashville after onlookers said they saw Trent attempting to choke West.

Trent had flown into a rage because West refused to buy her a cowboy hat, yelling at him and knocking his own cowboy hat into the street.

Bystanders restrained Trent after she put her hands around her husband's neck, though police say he had no trouble breathing during the ordeal.

Fans: The couple was in town to watch the Titans take on the Cowboys, a game Trent did not make it out of prison to see

With the trip already ruined, Trent was booked into Davidson County Female Correctional Development Center on charges of domestic assault.

She was released Monday on $2,500 bond.

The Titans went on to lose to the Cowboys 26-10 in their season opener.
