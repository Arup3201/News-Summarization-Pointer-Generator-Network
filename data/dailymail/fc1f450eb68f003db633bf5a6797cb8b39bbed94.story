Gareth Bale has hailed Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo as the 'best player in the world' but says the best piece of advice he has given him during their time together isn't football-related.

Bale joined the Spanish giants in a world record £86million transfer from Tottenham in September 2013 as he embarked upon life in a new country and culture.

And Bale revealed it was Ronaldo who told him where to live in the Spanish capital - something the Wales superstar is eternally grateful for.

Asked what is the best thing Ronaldo has taught him, Bale laughed in an interview with the Telegraph: ‘Where to find a house in Madrid, actually.'

The 25-year-old currently resides 20 minutes west out of Madrid in the La Finca part of Pozuelo de Alarcon - a town that many of Real's stars, including Ronaldo, live as well as their city rivals Atletico.

It is not only off-the-field that Bale has found a home after enjoying a stellar debut campaign at the Bernabeu where he played am integral role in helping the club win the Champions League.

Bale, who has missed some of this season due to injury, was also gushing in his praise for current Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo who has scored 23 goals in 17 appearances for the club so far this term. 

Those astonishing feats are something Bale admits he wishes to aspire to reach.

‘Learning off the best player in the world is just incredible,’ he added. 

'He’s helping me become a better player, which is my constant goal. I’m trying to get up to his level.'
