A family has released video footage that shows a grandfather who was allegedly left to die in the back of a police van, while police officers waited nine minutes to revive him.

Lenny McCourt lost consciousness in the cramped cage after being arrested for being drunk and disorderly at his home in Seaham, County Durham on 11 September 2010.

The 44-year-old had been pepper sprayed twice during his arrest and was taken to Peterlee police station.

Anger: The family of Lenny McCourt have released CCTV footage of his death after claiming police officers took too long to resuscitate him

Lenny MCourt's family called him a 'gentle giant, who loved all of his family'

Relatives of Mr McCourt have made the 'heartbreaking decision' to release the CCTV footage after the Durham Police officers involved did not face action, despite failing to administer immediate CPR.

Mr McCourt's sister-in-law Tracey McCourt, 47, said: 'Lenny could be here today if one of the police officers had done their job and tried to help him.

'It's clear from the CCTV that it took them more than five minutes to take his cuffs off and nearly ten minutes before they try and give him CPR.

'They are trained in first aid but if they aren't going to use it, or even try and get help, what is the point?

'They have a duty to protect the public and they just stood there with their hands on their hips while Lenny lay dying.'

Last November, an inquest at Crook Coroner's Court ruled that Mr McCourt died of heart disease precipitated by the stress of the events of the day and excess alcohol.

Coroner Andrew Tweddle ruled his death was by misadventure.

The death of Mr McCourt, grandfather to Reece, eight, and father to Toni, 27, and Launzie, 21, came as a huge shock to the family.

Tracey, who is married to Lenny's brother Gene, 49, said: 'We were all devastated, we still are.

'He was a gentle giant, who loved all of his family. He had five brothers who he adored. He didn't deserve to die alone in a police van.'

The family has released the footage as their own way of gaining justice after they felt let down by the police.

'People need to see this to show what is really happening when people are in custody,' Tracey, a factory worker, said.

'The way you see the custody sergeant who can't get to the phone quickly enough to phone for an ambulance explains that he wasn't alive.

'Lenny was pronounced dead at 5.42pm but the first family member didn't find out about it until 11.50pm - that's appalling.

A Durham police spokesman said the inquest found no officer had acted unlawfully

'It's disgusting how we have been treated, the whole process is a disgrace.

'I'm a rational person but when you see the people who are there to protect us failing to do that, I struggle to accept it.

"The more people that know about this, the better.

'It's a very tough video to watch, but the police are in a position of power and they need to be brought to account.'

The Independent Police Complaints Commission detailed a catalogue of failures by police, including officers waiting about nine minutes before trying to resuscitate Mr McCourt.

One officer was given a final written warning and another quit the force over the incident

PC Richard Clark, of Durham Police, was given a final written warning after a disciplinary panel found his actions on the day Mr McCourt died constituted gross misconduct.

Special Constable Jeanette Horlock, resigned from the force.

A Durham police spokesman said the inquest found no officer had acted unlawfully.

The force's head of professional standards, Superintendent Darren Ellis said: 'Since this tragic event we have reviewed our policies and procedures regarding the safe transportation of people taken into custody.

'We have also looked at our policies and procedures for ensuring all relevant officers and staff continue to receive appropriate first aid and refresher training.'
