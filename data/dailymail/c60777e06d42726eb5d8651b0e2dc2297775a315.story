Nigella Lawson has finally explained the 'Burkini' style swimsuit she wore on a beach in Australia.

The TV chef has revealed that she plumped for the Muslim style swimwear because her former husband Charles Saatchi did not want her to get a tan.

Nigella hit headlines in 2011 when she wore the head-to-toe three piece garment while she swam in the sea at Bondi Beach, Sydney.

Nigella Lawson has finally explained the bizarre 'Burkini' style swimsuit choice she wore on a beach in Australia

The TV chef has revealed that she plumped for the Muslim style swimwear because her former husband Charles Saatchi did not want her to get a tan

Friends of the star told the Sunday People that she did not pick the suit because she was shy about showing off her curvy figure, or because she was worried about getting sunburned in the 90 degree heat. 

It was because Saatchi likes his female ­partners very pale.

The friend said: 'Charles wants his women to be porcelain white or have alabaster skin. That’s the real reason why Nigella was so covered up.'

Nigella admitted she  did not htink much of the suit either.

She said: 'It was a very unflattering photo. Dry, I looked a lot better. Wet, I could see the hippo resemblance.'

Nigella bought the £79.99 burkini from UK-based Islamic swimwear company Modestly Active and has been credited with a boom in sales

The mother-of-two ­divorced the art collector after ­pictures emerged of him with a hand around her throat at a London ­restaurant last June.

Nigella bought the £79.99 burkini from UK-based Islamic swimwear company Modestly Active and has been credited with a boom in sales.

Burkinis are lightweight outfits made of Lycra and nylon that leave only the hands, feet and face showing.

They were originally imported from Turkey and Morocco, but now London-based companies Modestly Active and Modestkini, which have been selling the swimsuits since 2007, are cashing in on the boom.

Ismail Sacranie, sales and marketing director at Modestly Active, said: 'The first few years were a hard struggle but, over the past two years sales have grown between 300 and 400 per cent.'
