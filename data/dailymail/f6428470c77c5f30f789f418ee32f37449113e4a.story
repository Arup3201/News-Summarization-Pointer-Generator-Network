Court battle: Judges at the London Technology and Construction Court ruled in favour of a decision to stop a businessman carrying out piling work on his home on an estate owned by the Duke of Westminster's (pictured)

A businessman has been banned from carrying out piling work in the basement of his home in an exclusive London street after taking on one of Britain's richest landowners in court.

George Papamarkakis wanted to carry out the work as part of plans to extensively develop the basement in his home on Chester Row, but was denied permission by the Duke of Westminster's Grovesnor Estate.

The Estate argued that the work would cause 'significant nuisance to the neighbours and nearby residents' and was 'likely to damage neighbouring properties'.

Unhappy with the decision, Mr Papamarkakis took his fight to London's Technology and Construction Court but today failed to get the Estate's decision overturned.

Judges dismissed his argument that the Estate had taken the 'wrong mental attitude' towards him and let 'animus' cloud its judgement.

Mr Papamarkis had gained planning consent to modernise the property above and below ground last year after buying the house as a home for himself, his wife and their two daughters.

But the hedge fund manager also needed permission from the Grovesnor Estate who gave the thumbs up to his above ground plans but refused to give the green light to plans for the home's basement.

His company, Constance Long
Term Holdings Ltd, was also refused permission to carry out piling work
- a prerequisite for any future basement extension.

Lawyers argued that consent to the 
piling had been 'unreasonably refused' by the estate and that the works 
were essential to make the property 'future proof' and keep open the 
option of developing the basement at some point in the future.

Constance vehemently denied claims that 
it had not always followed 'best practice' in the past and that it had 'deliberately sought to hide away the piling details in the documents in
the hope or expectation that Grosvenor Estate would not notice them'.

Appeal: George Papamarkakis lost his appeal at the Tecnology and Construction Court

While Judge Justice Ramsey dismissed Constance's claims that the plans had been refused due to 'animus' or a 'wrong mental attitude' on the part of a senior Estate employee, he also said that criticisms of Mr Papamarkakis' holding company were unjustified.

Despite expressing 'some sympathy' for Mr Papamarkakis' frustration at the lack of approval, the judge ruled that the Estate had been entitled to withhold consent 
due to the 'significant additional disruption' to neighbours the work 
would entail, in terms of dust, noise and extra time taken to complete 
the job.

He added that the piling work was not necessary for the above ground project.

Homes in Chester Row have been known to sell for as much as Â£5million.
