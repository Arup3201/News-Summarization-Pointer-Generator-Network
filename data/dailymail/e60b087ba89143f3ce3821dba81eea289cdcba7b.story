A wheelchair-bound council equalities advisor who was caught attempting to have sex with a five-year-old girl and her mother is facing jail today.

Andrew Holdsworth-Wild, 58, was arrested at Victoria Station in central London with condoms, a box of Smarties, a colouring book and train tickets to Maidstone, Kent. 

The Westminster Council officer organised a liaison at a Travelodge with 'Jo', an undercover cop, and her fictional daughter 'Chloe', Southwark Crown Court heard.

Covert officers initially made contact with Holdsworth-Wild on the True Nudist website on February 22, 2011. 

The conversations then moved to an MSN forum where he said he enjoyed getting naked with his imaginary 'daughter' and liked 'playing, having sex and sexy times'.

Holdsworth-Wild also said he would 'love to play with a family' and made incestuous suggestions to Jo.

He was arrested on July 21, 2011, following the internet sting and was later sacked from his position as inclusion and access officer at the council, after an internal probe. 

Holdsworth-Wild was today found guilty of arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence, following a retrial.

He admitted possessing a level one indecent image of a child at the start of his original trial in August 2012.

Holdsworth-Wild appeared to be in shock while relatives in the public gallery sobbed as the verdict was announced. 

Adjourning sentence until May 3, Judge John Price said he could not promise that a custodial sentence would not be imposed. 

Prosecutor James Norman told the jury: 'This case is, in short, about the defendant's efforts to have sex with a five-year-old girl.

'Between February and July, 2011, he made arrangements to have a sexual encounter with a five-year-old girl called Chloe and her mother, Jo. 

'On July 21, he went to Victoria Station to meet Jo and Chloe and was going to take them to a Travelodge in Kent where he stayed for work. 

Holdsworth-Wild was an equalities advisor for Westminster City Council

'He brought a box of condoms and while he waited for them to arrive, he also bought a box of Smarties and a colouring book. 

'Fortunately Chloe does not exist and Jo is an undercover police officer.

'The only people who met him were other police officers who arrested him.

'The prosecution say the defendant intentionally arranged to have a sexual encounter with Chloe, a five-year-old girl.'

'Mr Holdsworth-Wild does not deny having had online conversations with undercover police officers during which he made arrangements to have sex with Chloe. 

'However, his case is those conversations were nothing more than fantasies and he never intended to go through with it.' 

A covert internet investigator called 'Gary' was deployed to the True Nudist website to snare paedophiles on May 22, 2011, Mr Norman said. 

'He then suggested moving the conversation to MSN. From that point onwards, unbeknown to Mr Holdsworth-Wild, the conversation was being recorded by police.'

Holdsworth-Wild told Gary that he and his made-up daughter 'just started getting nude at home'. 

'She sees me getting aroused and says she would like to help.

He also said: 'I like to share our bodies', adding that he liked 'playing, having sex and sexy times'.

Holdsworth-Wild also said he would 'love to play with a family' and 'I would like to have kids play with me.'

'That is an unambiguous statement of paedophilia and an intention to carry that out if he gets the opportunity', said Mr Norman.

Holdsworth-Wild also turned what had been a 'mundane' conversation with Jo into something more sinister, asking if her 10-year-old son was 'old enough to understand your needs'. 

'At the defendant's instigation there was a conversation about incestuous sexual activity between Jo and her son, which is obviously something he is interested in and excited by.'

Holdsworth-Wild, from Truro, Cornwall, denies a single count of arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence.
