Almost 17 million people shared Andy Murray's tears after he lost his dramatic Wimbledon match yesterday - the highest figure for any final at the tournament for more than 20 years.

It is thought to be the biggest tennis audience since at least 1990 as the nation united to watch the Scot's nail-biting Centre Court battle with Roger Federer.

At the peak of the match, an audience of 16.9 million was tuning in, overnight figures showed today. That amounted to two-thirds of the TV audience at that time, as the tournament reached its climax.

They saw the British number one break down in tears as he spoke to the crowd, to thank them - and his family - for the deafening applause throughout the match.

His emotional response touched the nation, which had been willing Murray to become the first British man to win the title since Fred Perry in 1936. Instead it was Federer who made history, equalling Pete Sampras's record of seven Wimbledon titles.

The 30-year-old now has a total of 17 Grand Slams, and has restored his world number one ranking.

Murray, who is representing Great 
Britain in the Olympics in just a few weeks, said last night that he 
plans to take some time away from the game.

'There's no point in going on the 
court until I'm ready to go out there and learn and work hard and do the
right things in the gym and in practice...

'So I'll wait and see how my body recovers after the next few days. I fell a lot of times this tournament. I got a lot of bruises all over my body and stuff.

'So I need to take a few days off, let everything heal, recover, and then see. But I won't be on the court next week, that's for sure.'

Murray's unusual display of emotion on
court took fans by surprise, also reducing girlfriend Kim Sears and 
mother Judy Murray to tears.

'I'm going to try this and it's not going to be easy,' he said, to cheers from the 15,000-strong crowd.

He congratulated Federer and thanked 'Team Murray' for their support.

'I'm going to try and not look at them
because I'll probably start crying again but everyone who is in that 
corner over there, who has supported me... we did a great job, so thank 
you.

'And, last of all, to you guys,' he 
told the crowd. 'Everybody always talks about the pressure of playing at
Wimbledon, how difficult it is.

'It's not the people watching, they make it so much easier to play.

'The support has been incredible,' he added, breaking down.

First Minister Alex Salmond said: 'Andy played an outstanding match and did Scotland proud.

'For Andy there is not just next year, but, as he said himself, he is getting ever closer to that Grand Slam breakthrough.'

And his brother, fellow tennis player 
Jamie Murray, wrote on Twitter: 'My brother is a champion. He may not 
have won but he is a champion.'

Federer, whose wife Mirka watched with
their twins Myla Rose and Charlene Riva, said: 'I think he's done so, 
so well, to be quite honest.

'I really do believe deep down in me 
he will win Grand Slams, not just one. I do wish him all the best. This 
is genuine. He works extremely hard. He's as professional as you can be.

'Things just didn't quite turn out for
him in the finals that he hoped for. But today I'm sure he got another 
step closer to a Grand Slam title for him. I really do believe and hope 
for him that he's going to win one soon.'

Murray revealed that he apologised to Federer for his show of emotion during the on-court interview.

'I just said to him, 'Sorry. I didn't obviously want that to happen'.

'You feel like you're kind of attention-seeking or something. It was not like that at all.'
