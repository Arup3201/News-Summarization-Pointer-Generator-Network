Removed: Harrods has been caught by the Italians selling 'fake' Tuscan extra virgin olive oil, and has had to remove the bottles from its shelves

Harrods has been caught by the Italians selling 'fake' Tuscan extra virgin olive oil.

The Knightsbridge store has had to remove bottles from shelves in response to an effort by the Italian food industry to protect the name and heritage of its famous brands.

The move is part of a wider crackdown in Britain and across Europe targeting retailers and manufacturers selling food which is not what it claims to be on the label.

The issue of fake and counterfeit food has leapt to the top of the political agenda following the horsemeat scandal of a year ago where horse was passed off as beef.

Olive oil is among a number of premium food products which has been particularly susceptible to fakery, however it is unusual for a store like Harrods to be caught out.

Previously, there have been problems with fake Basmati rice, ordinary meat and produce described as organic, fish being mis-labelled and counterfeit big brand drinks, such as vodka.

The problem with the Harrods brand 'Tuscan Extra Virgin Olive Oil', which sells for £12.95 for a 500ml bottle, first came to light during a search of the store's website.

Italian government officials then visited London, bought a bottle and submitted a report to the officials at the food and farming department DEFRA, which is responsible for policing food authenticity.

It appears that the olive oil may well have originated in Tuscany, however it is not allowed to be labelled as Tuscan olive oil unless the whole manufacturing process, including growing, pressing and bottling, happens in the region.

Stefano Vaccari, the inspector who uncovered the false Tuscan olive oil, said: 'Labels like that suggest the product's Tuscanness but it was bottled in the UK, as in fact it said on the label, and this contravenes the product protocol laid down by the European Community'.

Several months ago, Mr Vaccari discovered fake San Daniele ham in the UK and had it removed from the shelves.

Italy's newly appointed agriculture minister, Maurizio Martina, said: 'Protecting and promoting genuine Italian products around the world is an absolute priority for this government, and a strategic mission for the Italian economy.

'Defending designations of origin and Italy's heritage of food excellence is the battlefield where, on a daily basis, we deploy the finest supervisory forces available to the ministry. This result is further confirmation of the importance of European laws in this area, and of our ability to demand their proper implementation on EC territory.'

Harrods insisted the oil used was 100per cent from Tuscan olives, but said it had fallen foul of EU labelling rules because it was  bottled in the UK.

It said: ‘Harrods Extra Virgin Olive oil is made using only the finest olives from the Maremma region in Tuscany. This product was bottled in the UK, which was displayed on the label, however it was brought to our attention that in order for the product to be labelled ‘Tuscan’ the bottling process must also take place in Tuscany. We are investigating this oversight with our supplier.

‘The product was immediately removed from our shelves once the issue came to our attention last week. We are now looking to have the bottling process done in Tuscany, and will ensure all the relevant certification is receipted prior to the product going back on sale.’
