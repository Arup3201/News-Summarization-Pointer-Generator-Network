One fighter blows himself up when his rocket launcher backfires, while another accidentally shoots a comrade with a machine gun.

A third pulverises an entire room when he mistakenly detonates a bomb during a group photograph.

They are just some of the  Islamic State jihadists who have died in calamitous circumstances on the battlefield in footage that could have come from hit satirical film Four Lions.

Now videos of their demise are now being circulated online as users hit back at the terror group after it released horrific footage showing a Jordanian pilot being burned alive.

An Islamic State militant loads a mortar moments before the weapon explodes in his face. The footage is among a number of videos circulating online showing jihadists blowing themselves up on the battlefield

The jihadist killed himself after repeatedly re-firing his mortar without giving it time to cool down

Lt Moaz al-Kasasbeh's sickening murder has triggered worldwide revulsion, including a promise by Jordan's king to wage a 'harsh' war against the militants.

The Kingdom  launched dozens of new airstrikes yesterday against the regime as Jordan's Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh vowed to 'go after them with everything that we have'. 

Many of the clips have been packaged up into compilations like a warped version of You've Been Framed.

Some are accompanied by game show-style theme music, while others include comments lampooning the Islamist militants. Many scenes are too graphic too publish. 

 

In this footage, a jihadi destroys the room when he mistakenly detonates a bomb during a group photograph

In one, a jihadist kills himself after repeatedly re-firing his mortar without giving it time to cool down.

Eventually, one round blows up in the chamber, killing him instantly.  

Other footage shows fighters being taken out by snipers or burning to death when their trucks are hit by airstrikes.  

YouTube user As-salamu Alaykum, who posted one compilation clip, said: 'Fighting Jihad for ISIS is nothing more then joining a murder squad killing innocent Muslims, Christians and others.

'Most of the victims are women and children. If you are a Muslim and think that the Prophet will reward you for this, you're up for a big surprise. Hell is what awaits you all. 

'In the meantime, enjoy this video with real footage of jihadists killing themselves because they're just plain stupid.'  

This militant appears to be trying to light a fuse, but the explosive detonates before he has time to flee

It comes as Queen Rania of Jordan led protests in the capital Amman this morning as thousands took to the streets after Friday prayers to urge King Abdullah II to step up airstrikes against the Islamic State to avenge the brutal murder of pilot Moaz al-Kasaesbeh.

Crowds massed near the city's main Husseini mosque, then marched chanting 'Death to Daesh', using an Arabic acronym for the terror group, in the latest sign of mounting public anger.

The rally came three days after Islamic State released a video purporting to show Kasaesbeh being burnt alive in a cage as masked militants in camouflage uniforms looked on.

Jihadi fail: A militant fires a rocket launcher, but falls limply to the ground just a few feet in front of him

The act has been widely condemned as among the most sickening ever committed to film and has sent waves of revulsion across the Middle East.

Jordan's royal family have led the anti-ISIS protests in the country, with King Abdullah making an emotional visit to the pilot's grieving relatives in his tribal home village yesterday.

Queen Rania broke down in tears as she embraced and comforted his young widow.  

Jordan said its warplanes had launched dozens of new airstrikes yesterday against the Islamic State group after vowing a harsh response.

Jordan's Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh warned this was just the start of its offensive against the terror group, vowing to 'go after them with everything that we have'.
