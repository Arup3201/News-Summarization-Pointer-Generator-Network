Heidi Brett has been told either she or her landlord must pay to have the 50ft tree removed

It is a scene that was all too familiar at the height of the recent storms.

The trouble is, this fallen tree is still there three weeks after it was felled by 60mph winds...while neighbours continue to argue over who is responsible for its costly removal.

The 50ft leylandii, planted in a back garden, was already causing problems by overshadowing a next door flat in Walderslade, Kent.

Then, on Christmas Eve, matters came to a head when it crashed down on the roof and rear wall of the neighbouring property – cutting  off all the light from several  windows and rendering its garden virtually impassable.

Now Heidi Brett, who lives in the stricken flat, has been told that either she or her landlord, and not the owner of the garden in which the tree is still partly rooted, must pay £2,500 to have it removed.

In the meantime, the giant leylandii has been left lying at a 40 degree angle against her block.

The 35-year-old support worker was in her kitchen when she heard an enormous crash at the back door as the tree toppled.

She said her landlord’s insurance firm had suggested he could pay the bill, which could then be claimed back from the leylandii owner’s insurance company.

However, her landlord has refused to pay on the grounds that it is not his tree – leaving her saddled with the damage.

‘It’s a nightmare,’ Miss Brett said yesterday. ‘Bits of bricks are falling off and landing in my garden and the branches are getting droopy and  falling off.

‘There is water running down inside the loft space too.

‘It’s getting more dangerous the longer it is left there. The owner says as it is now on my land, it is my responsibility to get it moved.

‘But surely if you own something and it breaks or damages someone else’s property it’s the owner’s responsibility to fix it?’

She added: ‘My landlord’s insurance company has said that he will foot the bill and they will try to reclaim it from the tree owner’s insurance firm.

‘But that means he must first pay up out of his own pocket, and that’s where the problem lies. I think the tree owner should be responsible for removing it.

‘I’m in a stalemate now because my landlord is refusing to pay for it because it’s not his tree, which I understand.

Stalemate: Ms Brett will not now how much damage the tree has caused to her home until it is removed

‘It shouldn’t be down to the innocent party to clear up someone else’s mess.’

Miss Brett said that she will not know how much damage has been done to her home until the tree is taken away.

Sheila Stenning, 61, who owns the garden where the leylandii once stood upright, said: ‘It is not our responsibility because it is in their property.

‘I have spoken to our insurance company multiple times about it.

‘Their insurance company has to get it removed and then they can recover the costs.

‘I don’t want this dragging on and I appreciate Heidi’s point of view.’
