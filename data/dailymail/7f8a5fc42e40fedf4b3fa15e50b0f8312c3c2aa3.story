A men's college basketball team flying high on the wings of victory after a close win had a huge scare when its plane was forced to make an emergency landing due to engine failure.

The Mississippi State Bulldogs's chartered Embraer 145 twin engine jet made an emergency landing in St. Louis, Missouri, yesterday after it lost power in its right engine 20 minutes after takeoff.

The plane departed from Columbia, Missouri, after the Bulldogs beat the Missouri Tigers 77-74.

Coach Ray provided updates about the status of the team on Twitter. They will head back to campus today

Mississippi State coach Rick Ray posted on Twitter that he heard a loud noise from the plane before the flight attendant announced it had 'lost an engine' and needed to land.

Ray then wrote: 'Oh, that's all? Landed safely.'

Bulldogs team spokesman Gregg Ellis said the plane 'veered to the left and then went dark for a moment before settling' and that 'everyone aboard was shaken up a bit', ESPN reported. 

After landing, the team tried to secure another plane but was unable to do so because strong winds prevented the replacement aircraft from leaving Kentucky.

The team spent the night at a hotel in Festus, Missouri, because rooms in St. Louis were at a premium due to Mardi Gras festivities. 

Ellis, who provided numerous updates about the situation on social media, tweeted the team will take the bus back to campus in Starkville today.

This is not the first time the program has had a close call. 

During the 2008 Southeastern Conference tournament in Atlanta, the roof of the Georgia Dome was ripped open by a powerful storm toward the end of the Bulldogs' game against Alabama.

Mississippi State improved to 12-13 overall and 5-7 in conference play with the win against Missouri. 

The Bulldogs' next game is Thursday against rival Mississippi.
