From the moment Yorkshire was named as the venue for the Grand Depart of this year’s Tour de France, the script has had Mark Cavendish raising his arms in victory in Harrogate on Saturday.

A win would see him pull on the Tour leader’s yellow jersey for the first time in his career — and in his mother, Adele’s, home town, too.

‘It’s incredible that for the second time in my career the UK’s got the Grand Depart of the Tour de France,’ said Cavendish on Thursday.

‘The support not just in Yorkshire but in the whole of the UK is phenomenal. It’s like something I’ve never seen.

‘People who rode the Tour de France when it started in London in 2007 still talk about it but I think Yorkshire’s going to out-do that. I think everybody here still doesn’t really anticipate how big it’s going to be.

‘It’s exciting. The Tour doesn’t begin and end in Yorkshire. It’s 21 days, I have a very strong Omega  Pharma-QuickStep team and we want to be successful over the whole Tour.’

In the absence of Sir Bradley Wiggins, David Millar and Alex Dowsett — all Grand Tour stage winners in the last two years — Cavendish is one of only four Brits in the field.

‘In an ideal world, I’d have liked to have seen more Brits at this Tour de France,’ he said. ‘We’ve had so much success as a country and it’s thanks to those guys.’

Regardless of whether they were riding, Saturday’s first stage was always going to be all about Cavendish.

And while he sought to play down the importance of the day, knowing that crashes or his main rival, Marcel Kittel, could come between him and victory, Cavendish admitted: ‘It would be nice to wear yellow. I’ve not yet done that.’
