A mother emerged from court smirking after admitting that her vicious pitbull-type dog mauled an eight-year-old boy, leaving him scarred for life.

Owner Emma Gregory, 20, showed no remorse as she left Manchester Magistrates' Court after hearing details of the ‘terrifying attack’ which lasted several minutes on the young schoolboy who now needs plastic surgery.

District Judge Wendy Lloyd said allowing the dog out on the street was ‘like leaving a loaded gun in the garden’.

Mother-of-one Emma Gregory laughs after admitting her dog mauled a defenceless eight-year-old boy

Pet Tia attacked the boy as he walked home from school with his mother – gouging into his cheek, arm and leg.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, screamed in agony as he tried frantically to fend off the dog.

His mother used the boy’s schoolbag to hit the dog in a desperate bid to make it stop, a court heard.

The boy’s wounds were so bad that he needed plastic surgery.

Gregory, who has an 18-month-old baby, pleaded guilty to having a dog that was dangerously out of control, as well as a further count of having two fighting dogs.

The court heard that Gregory from Openshaw in Manchester, also owns a second pit bull-type dog called Mia.

The young boy was attacked by a pitbull-type dog, similar to the pitbull terrier pictured, which bit into his face, arms and legs

District Judge Lloyd said: ‘The victim was a vulnerable child and an aggravating feature is that this type of dog is a prohibited breed. I have seen pictures of the child’s injuries.

‘It is a mess. This little boy when he looks in the mirror every morning will remember this frightening attack.

‘Hopefully, I am told, the scarring will improve. It was something that should never of happened.’

She added: ‘You knew the type of dog it was and didn’t take adequate precautions.’

Gareth Hughes, prosecuting, had told the court that Gregory was seen shooing Tia out of the house and closing her door just moments before the attack on May 23.

Peter Etherall, defending, said Gregory - the mother of an 18-month-old baby - had never previously had any problems with the dogs.

Gregory will be sentenced at Manchester Crown Court next month.
