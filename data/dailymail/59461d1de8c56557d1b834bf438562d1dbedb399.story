A new chapter in the 77-year history of book publisher Penguin was written today with a deal to merge the business with rival Random House, creating the world's biggest book publisher.

The new venture, called Penguin Random House, will have an estimated one quarter share of the market for English language book sales and generate annual revenues in the region of £2.5billion.

Penguin's owner Pearson, which also publishes the Financial Times, will have a 47 per cent stake with Random House's German owner Bertelsmann holding the rest.

Random House is already the world's 
largest trade book publisher and Penguin is the fourth-biggest. The deal
still requires regulatory clearance and is not expected to be completed
for another year.

There is also the possibility that a rival party may derail the partnership - with HarperCollins owner, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, reportedly interested in making a £1billion offer for Penguin.

Unveiling
today's deal, the two companies said the tie-up would deliver 
‘significant benefits’ such as shared resources and more investment in 
authors and products than possible as standalone firms.

It
will join writers such as Random House's Jack Reacher creator Lee Child
and Fifty Shades of Grey's EL James - with Penguin's list of classical 
authors including Charles Dickens and Jane Austen.

London-based Penguin employs 5,500 people worldwide, with around 950 in the UK.

Random
House has 5,300 staff globally and last year its sales accounted for 
just under 15 per cent of the UK market, compared with Penguin's 11 per 
cent.

Penguin is one of the 
most recognisable brands in the world, having been set up by Allen Lane 
in 1935. The other publishers in the ‘big six’ are Hachette, Simon &
Schuster and Macmillan.

Their
power to set prices has been eroded by the boom in digital sales and 
the rise of Amazon which reportedly controls an estimated two-thirds of 
American print and ebook sales.

Big deal: Penguin's owner Pearson, which also publishes the Financial Times, will have a 47 per cent stake with Random House's German owner Bertelsmann (offices pictured in Guetersloh) holding the rest

Pearson's chief executive Dame Marjorie Scardino described Penguin as a 'successful, highly-respected and much-loved part' of the company.

She added that Random House was an almost perfect match in terms of Penguin's culture, standards and commitment to publishing excellence.

Dame Marjorie said the two publishers will be able to be more adventurous in trying new models in the world of digital books and digital readers.

Bertelsmann will have five directors on the board of the venture, with Pearson able to nominate four.

John Makinson, currently chairman and chief executive of Penguin, will be chairman, with Random House chief executive Markus Dohle taking the same role in the combined company.
