Rory McIlroy just helped Europe win the Ryder Cup, and it appears he may be victorious in his love life as well. 

The Northern Irish golfer, 25, had a famous and beautiful supporter in the stands at Gleneagles on Sunday - South African actress and model Shashi Naidoo. 

Naidoo posed with McIlroy's family in a picture posted to the champion golfer's Instagram, and she posted other pictures out on the golf course to her account as well, in one shot riding a golf cart with McIlroy's mother Rosie.

New flame for Rory? South African model/actress Sashi Naidoo posed for pictures with Rory McIlroy's family this weekend as the Northern Irish golfer competed in the Ryder Cup

Winner, winner: McIlroy (pictured) helped Team Europe win the Ryder Cup for an eighth year in a row at Gleneagles on Sunday

Family time: The South African model posted this picture on Instagram of her driving around Gleneagles with McIlroy's mother Rosie, which she later removed from the site

 

In an Instagram video of McIlroy making a key putt, the 33-year-old model writes: 'And that's how you do it! Rory McIlroy 8th hole.'

The World Number One played a key role in Europe's victory over the U.S. over the weekend and was caught starting the celebrations early yesterday when a bottle of champagne popped prematurely, spraying all over him and Graeme McDowell. 

McIlroy famously broke off his engagement to ex-girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki this past May, just days after sending out their wedding invitations.  

Wozniacki, a Danish professional tennis player, later revealed that McIlroy broke up with her in a short phone call and hasn't talked to her since. 

The tennis pro recently made a slight at McIlroy's short stature in the press, saying in one interview that she was looking forward to dating a taller man she can wear heels next to.

Shortly after their high-profile split, McIlroy was rumoured to have struck up a relationship with 25-year-old Irish lingerie model Nadia Forde.

After being introduced by mutual friends last year, the pair remained tight-lipped about whether or not they were exclusive.

But the golfer famously missed a practice session in the run up to the Open when he learnt that Miss Forde had been involved in a serious car crash - flipping her Fiat 500 Abarth six times on the M40.

The South African beauty also uploaded this picture of her and Sir Alex Ferguson to her Instagram account at the weekend with the message: 'Got to walk a few rounds of golf with Sir Alex Ferguson. What a legend!'

Summer romance: Irish model Nadia Forde, 25, was introduced to McIlroy following his split from Caroline Wozniacki and the pair were rumoured to have struck up a relationship

And he was later seen out partying with the pretty brunette in Liverpool in July following his triumph in the tournament. 

Despite the summer romance, McIlroy now claims he has refocused himself on his golf game, and it appears to have paid off with the recent Ryder Cup win. 

McIlory spoke with the BBC the day before the Europe versus America championship, saying 'golf is my girlfriend at the minute'.  

'I'm at the stage of my career and the stage of my life when I'm putting golf first.,' he said. 'Golf is the priority for me right now. For the foreseeable future that is what it is going to be.'

He also talked about how his golf career would make it hard to start any relationship right now: 'We're never really in the same place for very long. It is hard to keep relationships going [even] if you want to start one.'

Naidoo, meanwhile, appears to be single after divorcing husband Marc Sandler in 2011.

Earlier today, the model took to Twitter to deny rumours that she was McIlroy's new love interest.

She posted: 'I am NOT dating Rory Mcllroy or any other golfer for that matter. I was in Scotland supporting Team Europe at the Ryder Cup.' 

Naidoo is famous in South Africa for co-hosting a magazine show called 20Something, and for being named the celebrity winner of a reality show called Tropika Island of Treasure. 

She also owns modelling agency, Alushi, who represented Reeva Steenkamp before she was killed by her boyfriend Oscar Pistorius on Valentine's Day last year.

In the days after Miss Steenkamp's death, Naidoo said: 'It's still a big shock to us. I've known Reeva for years and she was an incredible, beautiful soul. It's shocking. An amazing girl has gone too soon.'

She also writes a well-followed fashion blog called Shashi's Closet. 

But a traumatic experience appears to have taken Naidoo to Scotland this weekend.

South Africa's Sunday Tribune reports that Naidoo was attacked in her upscale Johannesburg home on September 21, while she was sleeping. 

Naidoo woke up to the attacker, and was able to fight him off and push a panic button to get help. However, the attacker escaped and stole some of Naidoo's property including an iPad. 

Her father, Harry Naidoo, told the Tribune that his daughter was seriously rattled by the break-in and went to Scotland to 'clear her mind'. She is due back in South Africa today.
