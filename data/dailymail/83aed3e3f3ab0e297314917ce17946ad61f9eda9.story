The Pentagon claims that roughly a dozen Americans have joined ISIS forces in Syria.

They are just a few of the more than 100 Americans to join one of the numerous rebel groups filing the country. 

The new figures come as a clarification of recent comments by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.

The Pentagon has confirmed that roughly a dozen Americans have joined ISIS forces in Syria

Secretary
 of Defense Chuck Hagel said Wednesday that the problem of 'foreign 
fighters' aiding the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham 
(ISIS) includes far more Americans than has been previously reported – 
at least 100 and counting.

'We
 have acknowledged publicly we are aware of over 100 U.S. citizens who 
have U.S. passports who are fighting in the Middle East with ISIL 
forces,' he said during a televised interview.

'There may be more. We don't know.'

ISIL is another term for ISIS.

ABC News reports that previously it was assumed only a small number of the Americans believed to be in Syria were fighting alongside ISIS. 

'We believe that there are approximately 
100 American passport holders operating inside of Syria, we don’t know 
specifically who they are aligning themselves with.  We believe that 
there are maybe a dozen that are with ISIL,' Col. Steve Warren said.

The Americans are far from being unique. It's estimated more than 12,000 foreign fighters have joined rebel groups across the region over the last three years, an estimated 1,000 of whom are European.

Matt Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told reporters: 'many of these foreign fighters have joined ISIL’s ranks, and the group may use these fighters to conduct external attacks.' 

He added that these groups do not have the ability to launch large-scale attacks on U.S. soil as al Qaeda has. 

U.S. officials estimate ISIS now numbers as many as 10,000 fighters on both sides of the Syria-Iraq border.

A few of the American members
 have been killed on the battlefield, including 29-year-old 
Somali-American Abdirahmaan Muhumed, was employed cleaning jetliners for
 Delta Airlines before he left the U.S. to fight for the terror group.

Another,
 Douglas McArthur McCain, was killed in Syria weeks ago. It emerged 
later that he was a close friend of another foreign fighter, Troy 
Kastigar, who was killed in 2009 after joining the al-Shabab terror 
network in Somalia.

Chuck Hagel said more than 100 Americans are fighting in the Middle East alongside ISIS militants, a dramatic uptick from previous estimates of about a dozen

All
 three hailed from the Minneapolis, Minnesota area, in an area with a 
concentrated Muslim population and at least one mosque tied to radical 
anti-American ideology.

The New York Times reported
 six days ago that according to American intelligence and law 
enforcement agencies, 'nearly a dozen Americans' had traveled to Syria 
to fight for ISIS.

The Economist magazine
 put the number at 70 on Tuesday, citing a mishmash of statistics from 
the International Monetary Fund, the London-based International Centre 
for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, and the New 
York-based Soufan Group.

But hard numbers have been hard to come by, and Hagel's admission sheds new light on the size of the problem.

U.S.
 officials have warned that Americans who could use their passports to 
bring the ISIS fight back home pose one of the greatest homeland 
security threats to the United States since the 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks in
 2001.

Speaking
 Tuesday at the White House, Obama's chief spokesman said that the U.S. 
officials 'have been focused on countering the threat' for months. 

'The
 Department of State in March appointed Ambassador Robert Bradtke as 
senior adviser for partner engagement on Syria foreign fighters,' White 
House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. 

'So
 there’s been an intensive diplomatic effort to coordinate our efforts 
to confront and mitigate this threat. There’s been significant 
operational collaboration between DHS, FBI and all of their foreign 
counterparts, including Interpol, on this effort.

President Obama drew criticism Wednesday in Estonia for backing off of his resolve to 'destroy' ISIS with a weaker pledge to make it 'manageable'

Hagel said Wednesday that with so many American passport-holders able to re-enter the U.S. after joining the ISIS jihad, 'we can't take a chance ... on saying, "Well, let's technically define this. Is it a real threat today or tomorrow?"' 

He reiterated the resolve of U.S. officials including President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry to wipe the Islamist terror group off the map.

America's mission in Iraq, Hagel said on CNN, is 'not "contain." It’s exactly what the president said: "degrade and destroy".'

Obama caught flak on Wednesday morning in Estonia for waffling between hard-line and soft-pedal positions on the Islamist group that has cut a wide and deadly swath through massive portions of eastern Syria and northern Iraq. 

The primary U.S. objective 'is to degrade and destroy' ISIS 'so that it’s no longer a threat not just to Iraq but also the region and to the United States,' the president said during a press conference.

But minutes later he said a successful American effort in the region would 'shrink' the group's 'sphere of influence, its effectiveness, its financing, its military capabilities to the point where it is a manageable problem.'

Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt was among the lawmakers who lashed out later in the day.

'Terrorists who behead Americans are not "manageable," Blunt said in a statement. 'They must be stopped, and we need President Obama to communicate a clear strategy and goals on how he plans to eliminate this threat.' 

Hagel, meanwhile, clung to Obama's first statement while ignoring the second.

'You've got to destroy it,' he said of ISIS, 'because if we don't destroy it, it will get worse.' 

The soft-spoken defense secretary stopped short of offering any guarantees, however.

'Vows are something beyond my mortal capacity of doing,' he said. 'We will do everything possible that we can do to destroy their capacity to inflict harm on our people and Western values and our interests.' 

The Pentagon will achieve the White House's strategic objectives, Hagel explained, by cooking up a menu of tactical options for Obama to choose from.

'Our mission,' he said, 'is to provide him those options and those plans to accomplish the mission of "destroy and degrade" the capability of ISIS.'

And speaking of the growing number of Americans who have taken up arms against U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East, he conceded that 'this crowd is a dangerous crowd.'

'This crowd is as dangerous a group of people – beyond just terrorists – they are an army,' he said, 'marrying this with an ideology and a capacity to do things.'

'They control half of Iraq today. They control half of Syria today. We better be taking them seriously.'

Obama will lead a UN Security Council meeting this month devoted to the question of how to handle foreign fighters and whether to restrict their movements. 

British Prime Minister David Cameron has called for new anti-terrorism powers to limit their access to the UK and determine where they can and can't go. 

Kerry said earlier in the day that American might would pursue the killers of two American journalists whose beheadings were captured on video and spread globally through social media.

'[T]hose who have murdered James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria,' he vowed, 'should know that the United States will hold them accountable too, no matter how long it takes.'
