The U.S military has sent in Special Ops forces to speed up the training of Iraqi troops to fight ISIS.

The operation is crucial to the military's campaign against Islamic States militants, who released a video showing the murder of aid worker Peter Kassig yesterday. 

Speaking at the Army's National Training Center at Fort Irwin in California yesterday, Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Pentagon has decided to accelerate its mission using troops already in Iraq - while funding is sought for a broader initiative.

He said 
special operations forces had moved into the country's Anbar province
in recent days to begin work on the training effort.

Mr Hagel said Army General Lloyd Austin, the head of U.S.forces in the region, had recommended American troops start the training with some of the 1,600 personnel already in the country to advise the Iraqi military.

He said: 'We agreed with General Austin's recommendations to take
some of the special operations forces that he has in Iraq and
give them some early missions with the Iraqi security forces in
Anbar province just to kind of continue the mission, accelerate
the mission.

'So yes, we're doing what we can with the resources we have
to give some acceleration to that.'

Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, confirmed about 50 special operations troops were at Ain al-Asad air
base working to set up the training mission. 

The base was home
to a major U.S. military presence during the Iraq war.

The announcement comes after President Obama said last week the number of U.S troops would be roughly doubled.

The acceleration of the operation, which is crucial to the military's campaign against Islamic State, came as the terror group released a video showing the murder of aid worker Peter Kassig yesterday

The decision meant adding 1,500 military personnel to establish sites to train nine
Iraqi brigades and set up two more centers to advise military
commands.

The President also sought $5.6 billion in funding from Congress for
the initiative, including $1.6 billion to train and equip Iraqi
forces. 

Officials initially said the funding would have to be
approved by Congress before the new effort could begin.

However, it was reported on Saturday that the U.S. military
already had a team of troops at Ain al-Asad working on the
mission. 

About a dozen countries had made verbal
commitments to help the training effort and officials hoped that 
U.S. forces starting the mission would encourage foreign
partners to move ahead as well.
