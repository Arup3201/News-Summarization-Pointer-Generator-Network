'A lot of prayers were said': Angela Daly, 64, who was leading the school trip to Tanzania, praised the bravery of the pupils caught in the ambush

British schoolchildren were held at gunpoint by masked robbers and struck with machetes during a terrifying roadside ambush in Africa.

Seven gunmen fired AK-47 assault rifles above the heads of 14 youngsters after holding up their truck in Tanzania.

Some of the pupils – aged between 15 and 18 – were hit with the flat of machete blades as the attackers screamed: ‘I kill you.’

A tour guide was also stabbed in the back during the 90-minute ordeal.

The eight boys and six girls – all boarders at Cranbrook School in Kent – were on an aid expedition to a school in Tanzania.

They were travelling back from a visit to a game reserve when their truck was blocked by two lorries.

The party was being led by Angela Daly, a former head teacher, who said: ‘We heard rapid gunfire from outside. We didn’t know what was happening because we were sat down on mattresses – we couldn’t see over the sides of the truck.

‘Then a man wearing a bala-clava climbed over the back with a machete. Seconds later another man came over with an AK-47.

‘Their English was limited but they said, “I kill you”.

They fired from within the truck above our heads, which temporarily deafened a number of the pupils.'

‘The park ranger who was with us was stabbed in the back. It was not a life-threatening wound but nonetheless serious.

‘They hit a number of us, the pupils and myself included. It was always with the flat of the blade on the thigh.’

The ambushed happened in the Tabora region of north-west Tanzania

Private school: The group of 14 pupils, aged 15 to 18, and two staff from £4,000-a-term Cranbrook School in Kent were said to be 'shaken' but uninjured following the robbery last month

She was accompanied by her husband George, 64, who was kicked in the head by the men during the ambush.

Mrs
Daly said they feared for their lives. ‘All of us thought at some point
they would kill us. It was a traumatic experience,’ she added.

The
group was ordered to lie face-down, searched and told to hand over all 
of their money, which amounted to about £350. Mobiles, cameras and other
property were also stolen.

Mrs Daly said the reaction of the pupils was ‘incredible’.

‘They remained completely calm and composed,’ she said.

‘How they behaved was exactly the right way. You don’t resist when 
someone is pointing a gun at you. Afterwards, they did admit a lot of 
prayers went up.’

The party was held for 90 minutes and could hear further shots as the gang ransacked other vehicles held up at the roadblock.

The pupils were given the opportunity to fly home but decided to complete their month-long trip.

Tanzanian police have charged four men over the attack.
