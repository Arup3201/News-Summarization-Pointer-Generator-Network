A pair of raiders caught clutching a crowbar and £200 outside a pub they had just burgled looked certain to go to jail.

Yet despite being caught red-handed, they laughed at their victims as they walked free from court after a blunder by prosecutors.

Crown Prosecution Service lawyers lost vital evidence including a sock containing the money, fingerprints and photos of the crime scene.

Landlady April Grimes is fuming after the burglary case was dropped because of a lack of evidence

Mrs Grimes, pictured with her daughter April, said she is more than £300 out of pocket after having to pay to replace smashed windows in her pub

When they asked for an adjournment to hunt for the evidence, a district judge refused and dismissed the case.

Last night furious pub landlady April Grimes, 47, branded the justice system ‘a joke’ after the pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, walked free.

She said: ‘These lads were caught red-handed – I saw them being caught. I thought they might go to prison, yet they got away with it.

‘The two defendants were laughing at us going out of court. They knew they were not going to be sent down. It was joke justice.

‘They got away with it because someone didn’t do the basic job of getting the evidence together.’

The break-in happened in the early hours one morning in July as Mrs Grimes slept upstairs with her partner at the Britannia Tavern in Oldham. The thieves smashed a back window to gain entry, waking the couple, who dialled 999.

About £200 of coins was stolen from the fruit machine at the Britannia Tavern pub in Oldham

Mrs Grimes watched from her upstairs window as the police arrived moments later to find two men outside with cash from the pub fruit machine. One of them approached an officer brandishing a crowbar and was tasered before they were both arrested.

Mrs Grimes said: ‘They had lined up bottles on the bar and had been drinking. They then raided the fruit machine and put the money in a sock. There must have been about £200 in coins in there.

‘The police were great and  we thought we had a good case, as they were caught red-handed.’

But the landlady said she was stunned when she heard the pair, aged 42 and 31, intended to plead not guilty when they appeared in court last week. ‘They had put aside three days for the trial,’ she said. ‘The police were there and we all thought it was going to be a cut and dried case.

‘Then the CPS came over to me and said the case had been dismissed because of lack of evidence.

‘They told me they didn’t have the sock used to hold the money, photos of the scene, fingerprint  evidence and photos of the fruit machine and smashed window.

Mrs Grimes said she will now make a formal complaint to the CPS and said slammed the 'joke justice' system

A district judge at Oldham Magistrates' Court dismissed the case because of a 'lack of evidence'

‘I’m not surprised it was down to lack of evidence – they seemed to have lost the lot.’

The district judge at Oldham magistrates’ court dismissed the case as an ‘abuse of process’.

Mrs Grimes said: ‘I’m livid. Not being able to deliver the evidence is just not good enough. I have lost up to £400 in repairs.

‘People will go out and commit these crimes and they are doing it because they know the courts are letting them off. These guys didn’t even get a smack on the wrists.’

She is making a formal complaint to the Crown Prosecution Service.

Last night Kate McAlinden, the district crown prosecutor for the area, said: ‘I am looking into why the evidence was not available as a matter of urgency so I can contact the victim with a full explanation.

‘Before making any further comment, the CPS will consider the district judge’s reasons for dismissing the case.’
