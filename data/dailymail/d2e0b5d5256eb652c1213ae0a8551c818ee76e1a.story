Cancer victims are reducing their chances of survival by delaying reporting symptoms because they do not want to waste their doctor’s time.

Even though immediately going to a GP increases the chance of the cancer being caught, some are waiting up to a month after noticing signs, research shows.

There are concerns many are not aware of the warning signals – or are too embarrassed describing lumps over the phone.

Some patients adopt a stoical approach and decide it is not worth bothering their GP.

Britain has one of the worst cancer survival rates in Europe and experts believe it may partly be because patients are delaying seeking help.

Typical symptoms that patients ignore include a persistent cough, which could signal lung cancer, or a sore throat and ulcers which could mean throat cancer but are mistaken for a cold.

Other symptoms can include general weight loss and tiredness.

Delays of a month can be life-threatening, as once patients see their GP and have a diagnosis,  they will still have to wait to be referred to hospital for further tests and scans.

It can in fact be several months before they start treatment, by which time the cancer will have spread and become more difficult to treat.

Research by the University of Cambridge 
and University College London has found that patients with rarer cancers
 affecting the throat wait the longest.

They asked 14,320 cancer patients how long they had waited after first noticing troublesome symptoms before seeing their GP.

An implant made from curry powder could help beat breast cancer.

Curcumin, the spice used to make turmeric, has known anti-cancer properties.

But eating curry does not help, as the spice gets broken down in the stomach.

Scientists at the University of Louisville,  Kentucky, have now tackled the problem by packing the powder inside 2mm-long dissolving capsules.

They found the capsules shrank tumours in mice by about a third and slowed the rate at which rogue cells reproduced.

The average time was ten days rising to 22 days for patients with oesophageal cancer and 30 days for oropharyngeal cancer – both affect the throat.

Women were on average 10 per cent less likely to wait around than men, who are notoriously reluctant to seek medical help.

Sara Hiom, from Cancer Research UK, which commissioned the research, said: ‘Some symptoms are more obvious than others so the important thing is to get to know your own body and what’s normal for you.

‘When cancer is diagnosed earlier, treatment is usually more effective and the chances of beating the disease are higher.’

The study, published in the International Journal of Cancer, found the over 75s were 80 per cent more likely to see their doctor promptly than younger patients, suggesting they are more alert to the symptoms.

And those with more common cancers tended to seek help more quickly. The average time was a week for breast cancer patients and six days for prostate cancers.

The shortest time was for bladder cancer – two days – and kidney cancer – three. The symptoms for these two tumours are very alarming – blood in the urine – which would explain why patients do not wait around.

Professor Jane Wardle, of University College London, said: ‘These findings suggest that lack of knowledge about symptoms may play a significant role in any delay in going to get checked out with the doctor for oropharyngeal and oesophageal cancer.’

In 2011 researchers at King’s College London warned that patients were being too stoical about cancer symptoms, with two thirds waiting at least a week before making an appointment.
