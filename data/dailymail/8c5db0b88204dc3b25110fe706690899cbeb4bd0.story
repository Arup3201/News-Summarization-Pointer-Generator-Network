An Oregon woman was arrested earlier this month after she allegedly vandalized another woman's car with lipstick after a parking dispute, and then told the woman there was nothing police could do about because she's rich.

The incident happened on December 3 in a parking lot of a Fred Meyer grocery store in Beaverton, Oregon, when a woman reported that a Porsche SUV had parked extremely close to her Mercedes Benz.

When the driver of the Mercedes, identified as Mimi Chim, made a comment to the driver of the Porsche, Maria Meracle, an altercation started.

Too rich: Maria Meracle thinks she's too rich to pay the consequences for vandalizing another woman's vehicle

Chim told police that Meracle began yelling and cursing at her before she took out a tube of lipstick and used to write an incoherent message on the window of Chim's Mercedes.

After the altercation, Chim got back into her vehicle and told Meracle that she was calling the police.

'Chim told me that the female subject then yelled that she was rich and 
the police couldn't do anything,' according to an incident report obtained by KPTV.

Meracle denies making the statement and damaging Chim's car.

Parking lesson: Meracle told police she was at the store to pick up a big screen TV and wanted the best parking spot available

When police arrived on the scene, Chim told told the officers that she wanted Meracle arrested.

Meracle, the arresting officer notes in his report, initially refused to show officers her driver's license.

'The female subject was very curt with me and stated that somebody had 
parked inappropriately next to them,' the report states.

According to police, Meracle admitted that the other driver was in the space first, but said that she was there to pick up a big screen TV and wanted to be close to the store.

Vandal: Despite admitting to damaging the other vehicle, Meracle says the charges against her are too severe

The arresting officer acknowledged in his report that Meracle's Porsche had been backed into the disputed parking space, and that its left rear tire was a foot or more into the parking space where Chim had parked her Mercedes.

Meracle has been charged with harassment, criminal mischief and disorderly conduct.

According to KPTV, she admitted to writing on Chim's window with lipstick, but think the crimes with which she's been charged are too severe.
