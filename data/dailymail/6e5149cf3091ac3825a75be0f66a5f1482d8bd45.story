They are rumoured to be tying the knot in Italy this weekend.

And wedding preparations for the nuptials of Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel seemed to be getting underway on Wednesday, with Justin spotted enjoying pre-wedding drinks with guests including Saturday Night Live star Andy Samberg.

But rather than enjoy a modern wedding full of luxurious trappings, the multi-millionaire couple seem to have opted for a very rustic-style occasion.

Preparations: Justin Timberlake enjoyed pre-wedding drinks with a group of guests on Wednesday night in Brindisi, Italy

Interior shots of the Italian castle known as a 'castello' in Brindisi, show overgrown grass and ye olde stone monuments dotted around the grounds.

Horses graze next to a ramshackle stable, along with hay bales and a rickety teepee style structure with fire underneath.

Celebrations: Justin certainly appeared to be enjoying himself as he was surrounded by friends for the occasion

There are several loungers and beds laid out among the grounds, with a basket of apples dangling over one double bed.

There has even been a sighting of a group of Italian entertainers dressed in traditional costume while guests enjoyed a country-style picnic of tomatoes and potatoes, along with obligatory peasant clay pots.

Celebration: Justin Timberlake's Saturday Night Live friend Andy Samberg was one of the famous faces enjoying a welcome drink on Wednesday before the firework display

Jetted over: Samberg is one of several friends and family said to be flown to Italy by private jet from New York  City

Justin was pictured by Life & Style magazine sporting a grey and black hat, as he mingled with the 'few hundred' guests who sipped champagne in the grounds of the castle in southern Italy.

The guests later enjoyed a lavish firework display in a nearby seaside town.

Fiery blasts of red, green and white 
lit up the sky, while a large van and several 
spotlights were seen in the area.

An insider told the New York Post that Justin, 31, and Jessica, 30, chose the Italian location, near Naples, because it 'means a lot to both of them.'

According to the newspaper, Jessica's maid of honour will be her best friend Lindsay Ratowsky, while the A-Team star's stylist Estee Stanley, who is also a partner in his home décor business HomeMint has been helping to plan the wedding.

'A private plane was flown out of New York to take guests to Italy, including both their publicists,' a source told the newspaper.

'But the event has been shrouded in a lot of secrecy, and not even the guests were told the exact location or day of the wedding before they left.'

Samberg and music producer Timbaland are both said to have been flown out to Italy by private jet.

The
couple are reported to have sent 'vague save the date notifications' 
back in the spring, and guests are reported by the newspaper as being 
'prohibited from bringing cameras or phones.'

Meanwhile, it has been reported that Justin is preparing to perform a dance to Jessica's favourite 'N Sync song at the wedding.

Into the wild: The extensive grounds appear to feature donkeys, a ramshackle stable and log fences

Traditional country mood: The wedding venue seemed a far cry from the more salubrious venues the couple are used to

The
Cry Me A River hitmaker has been rehearsing a surprise routine to his 
former band's track It's Gonna Be Me with his best man and ushers as he 
prepares for his nuptials to the Total Recall actress.

A source told The Sun newspaper: 
'Justin has been working on this for months. Jessica used to love the 
track growing up and he wants it as a special treat.

'It will be very much tongue-in-cheek. There will be loads of exaggerated boy band moves and poses. She's going to love it.'

Picnic

The pop star-turned actor - who sold 
more than 50 million albums with 'N Sync - got engaged to Jessica last 
December and the pair are widely reported to be tying the knot in at 
some point this weekend.

An insider told Us Weekly the couple is taking 'extra precautions' to keep details of their nuptials secret.

Spokespersons for Biel and Timberlake have not responded to MailOnline's request for comment.

Timberlake, 31, and Biel, 30, became engaged in December 2011, after he proposed in the mountains of Jackson, Wyoming.

The singer-turned-actor is said to have celebrated his bachelor party in September.

Photos
of the star surfaced with a group of 
male friends - first in Las Vegas, and later in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico -
amid reports the days to Timberlake's wedding date were 
winding down.

Although they have been tight-lipped 
about their plans, the Alpha Dog star recently reminisced 
about when he asked his fiancée on their first date.

That was back in 2007 - after Timberlake got her details from a friend.

He told UK's Hello! magazine: 'I did 
it the old fashion way - by telephone. That’s something I learned from 
both my stepdad and my grandfather - that there is a thing called 
chivalry and it doesn’t have to die with the birth of the internet.

'The way I see it, if you’re asking a girl out on a date, it’s only right to do it in a way that she can hear your voice.'

But because he was a big name popstar at the time, not to mention a former Mouseketeer, it was not an easy sell.

Pre-party: The wedding guests dressed casually for the drinks, as they mingled in the rustic surroundings

The SexyBack singer admitted: 'I had to be pretty persistent in order to get her to say yes.

'But I have a fair amount of tenacity and if I want something I stick to it. And in the end she agreed.'

He also said that their most important quality as a couple is their willingness to work hard on their relationship.

He said: 'Some days are better than 
other days for all of us - and if we have our good days and bad days 
individually, and then we’re dealing with someone else’s good and bad 
days on top of that, it’s going to add up.

'But what I have learned from my stepdad is something as important, which is patience and compassion.

'Because when you are living with someone else, those two qualities go a long way.'

Jessica has meanwhile insisted she has not turned into a fearsome 'bridezilla' in the run-up to the big day.

She told E! News earlier this month: 'I'm just pretty much cool as a cucumber in general in my life. So no, I'm cool.'

The new issue of Life & Style Weekly is on newsstands now.
