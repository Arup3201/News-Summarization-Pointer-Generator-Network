Gunned down: Felix DeJesus III, 40, of Cromwell was killed selling a Samsung tablet he had advertised on Craigslist

A father-of-two was shot dead in his car after setting off to sell a Samsung tablet he had advertised on the internet marketplace Craigslist.

Felix DeJesus III, 40, of Cromwell, Connecticut died from a single gunshot to the head after going to meet a man in nearby Hartford who had seemed particularly keen to buy the electronic gadget.

According to his father Felix DeJesus Jr, the  man had called repeatedly wanting to buy the item.

Mr DeJesus Jr  told NBC Connecticut: 'This guy kept on calling and calling, so the guy arranged for my son to see him last night and my son said, "Oh, I'll be back, Dad."

'The guy had no nerve, didn't even wait for him to get out of the car. Shot him right in the car.

'They took my son, my only son. Now his kids are left alone with nobody except for us, that's just not right.'

Police responding to a 911 call discovered Mr Dejusus in his car suffering from a single gunshot wound to the head.

He was transported to Hartford Hospital where he was taken off life support at 3:45 am and died a short time later.

His father added: 'My son, I taught him how to be a good man, not a hoodlum in the streets and this guy, whoever killed him, I wish he dropped dead.  I wish somebody finds him and shoots him in the head so he can know how it feels.'

According to his family, Mr Dejesus who leaves behind a fiancee and children aged one and two, had no criminal history.

Local police said they were keen to speak to witnesses. They said they were not certain that the man who arranged to buy the tablet was the killer.

Hartford Police Lt. Brian Foley said: 'As we speak Major Crimes is actively investigating. We'll continue to investigate. We're making progress with the investigation.'

Anyone with information should call Hartford police at 860-757-4000.

Devastated: Mr DeJesus's father Felix DeJesus Jr said his son was a law-abiding man not a 'hoodlum in the streets'

Last month a jury recommended the death penalty for a self-styled street preacher convicted of killing three down-and-out men lured by bogus Craigslist job offers despite his mother's tearful plea for leniency.

The same Ohio jury that first convicted Richard Beasley made its recommendation after hearing from his mother and other witnesses who testified of the 53-year-old having had a rough childhood that included physical and sexual abuse.

Beasley was convicted of teaming up with a teenager in 2011 to lure men with offers of farmhand jobs in southeast Ohio and to rob them. Three men were killed, and a fourth who was wounded testified at Beasley's trial.
