After training at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Whitelaw made her stage debut when she was 18.

Her first film roles came in The Sleeping Tiger, in 1954, followed by Carve Her Name With Pride and Hell Is a City.  

She met Samuel Beckett in 1963, working with him until the playwright's death. He called her 'a perfect actress'. 

Before long she was a regular in British films, gaining international acclaim for her performance as Mrs Baylock, the evil guardian of Damien - a devil child - in The Omen in 1976.

Whitelaw earned a Bafta for her performance - one of seven throughout her career in film and television.

She went on to star in The Krays alongside Gary and Martin Kemp in 1990, and made a recent appearance in police comedy film Hot Fuzz in 2007. 

In a 1996 interview, Whitelaw, who suffered from stage fright, said she was finished with acting.

Her first film roles came in The Sleeping Tiger, in 1954, followed by Carve Her Name With Pride and Hell Is a City, but her most memorable performance was arguably in The Krays (pictured)

She said: ‘I’m not really interested in acting anymore. It’s not the centre of my life. I always thought it was a bit of a fibbertigibbety occupation.’

In an interview with the Independent in 1997 she revealed that she was not overly concerned about dying.

'Oh, no. Death's not one of those things that frighten the life out of me,' she explained. 

'Getting up on stage with the curtain going up frightens me more.'

Whitelaw, who lived in Hampstead in her later years, was married to the actor Peter Vaughan from 1952 to 1966 and, until his death, to the writer and drama critic Robert Muller.

She leaves behind Matthew, her only child.
