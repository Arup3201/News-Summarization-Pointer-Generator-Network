Pushed to the edge: George Bingham, son of Lord Lucan, says the rumours surrounding his father's disappearance tormented him

Lord Lucan's son has revealed how rumours surrounding his father's mysterious disappearance pushed him to the brink of a nervous breakdown.

George Bingham said the gossip surrounding the case, including claims he and his sisters had travelled to Africa for secret meetings with their father, sent his life spiralling out of control.

The former investment banker, 45, denies those claims and added that he hopes his revelations will help end the speculation that has caused him and his family so much pain.

'[W]ith the passage of time, it has become bigger and easier to fabricate complete nonsense and create lies around it, with fewer people left alive to contradict it,' Mr Bingham told the Daily Mirror

'Any person can get a grainy, slightly out-of-focus Polaroid from the late 70s, of a man with a moustache and say, "That’s Lord Lucan". I can’t prove they’re wrong.'

Mr Bingham's comments today came as it emerged the BBC are planning a new documentary which is set to make previously unreported allegations about Lucan.

They include a claim from a Switzerland-based driver that he drove the aristocrat across Europe on the night he went missing in 1974.

The Corporation aired another investigation earlier this year in which Shirley Robey, a PA who worked for Lucan's associate Lord Aspinall, said she booked tickets for Mr Bingham and his sisters to fly to Gabon to see their father.

Mr Bingham attacked the broadcaster for indulging in 'low-grade speculation [and] wholly unsupported journalism' with public money.

Lucan vanished without a trace 38 
years ago after the brutal killing of Sandra Rivett, nanny to his 
children, at his family's home in Belgravia, Central London, on November
7, 1974.

Since the killing
and the aristocrat's disappearance, detectives have developed a theory 
that Lucan killed Miss Rivett by mistake, believing she was his wife 
with whom he was embroiled in divorce proceedings.

It
is thought that the Earl went on to commit suicide, but rumours have 
since abounded that the Earl, aided by associates at the highest levels 
of the British Establishment, fled the country to evade justice.

Although Mr Bingham, who was aged just
seven and in the house at the time of the killing, believes his father 
is innocent of the murder, he is adamant that Lucan did indeed go on to 
commit suicide.

As a 
teenager he says he 'forgot about' his father, and it was only when 
Lucan was declared officially dead in 1992, when Mr Bingham was 32, that
memories began to haunt him.

His
struggle to come to terms with the lurid speculation came to a head 13 
years ago when he burned everything he owned that reminded him of his 
father.

'It’s one thing not
knowing if your father is alive or dead, but quite another thing to 
rise each day to hear others claiming they have seen him,' he told the 
Mirror.

He described how, 
feeling close to a 'collapse of the mind', he gathered together 
everything he could relating to his father, including papers, books and 
photographs.

'I dumped them in a supermarket trolley and took them to a waste site and watched as they all went up in flames,' he said.

Rumours
arose again at the beginning of the Noughties when Mr Bingham took two 
long trips to Namibia, prompting speculation he was out there to visit 
his father.

He denies the 
rumours, saying that he in fact went to the desert there to work through
stress developed in his high-pressure investment banking job.

Indeed,
he says, it would be strange for a white British aristocrat to attempt 
to flee to anonymity in a country that is 99 per cent black African.

A
coroner, in the absence of the prime suspect, declared in 1975 that 
Lucan had indeed killed Miss Rivett. Mr Bingham has said he believes his
father took a boat into the English Channel and scuppered it, drowning 
himself.
