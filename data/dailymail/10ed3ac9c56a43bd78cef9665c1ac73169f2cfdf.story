A businessman who once owned the world's most expensive home but was then exposed as a fraudster has failed in his claim to claw back £66million from the taxpayer after his mansion was seized by the State.

Baljit Singh Bhandal bought and developed Updown Court, a 100-room mansion in Surrey, using the proceeds from money laundering and evading tax on alcohol sales.

HM Revenue and Customs took control of the home as part of an investigation into his business - but his prosecution on fraud charges subsequently collapsed.

However, today a High Court judge told him he was not entitled to compensation because it was 'beyond any reasonable doubt' that he was in fact guilty of the crimes he was accused of.

Luxurious: The home was once the world's most expensive property when it went on sale for £70million

Bhandal bought Updown Court in the 1990s, after it had been practically gutted by the Great Storm of 1987, and rebuilt the interiors in a lavish style.

The home was raided by HMRC in 2001, after Bhandal was accused of smuggling duty-free alcohol out of the bonded warehouse where it was stored and selling it on the black market.

He was taken to court, but the case collapsed when it emerged that the manager of the warehouse was a police informant.

Bhandal jumped bail and left the country using a false passport during the failed trial, but on his return to the UK in 2005 he was jailed for eight years for attempted kidnap.

In his latest legal struggle, he argued that HMRC owed him millions in compensation because he would have been able to develop and sell Updown Court if he had not been arrested and prosecuted on the fraud charges.

Fraud: Bhandal lost his claim that the house, which boasts a bowling alley, was wrongly seized

Government lawyers insisted that he was guilty all along despite the collapse of the trial, saying: 'There was no acquittal on the merits and it was clear that massive fraud had been committed.'

They claimed the seizure of the mansion was legitimate because it had been bought using the proceeds of crime.

Mr Justice Collins today dismissed Bhandal's case, saying: 'I regarded him as a thoroughly unsatisfactory witness.

'I am satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that he is guilty of the criminal conduct alleged against him and that Updown Court was acquired from the proceeds of crime.'

The house in Windlesham, Surrey was said to be the most expensive home on the market anywhere in the world when it went up for sale for £70million.

It was owned by property tycoon Leslie Allen-Vercoe, who claimed to have spent £30million on renovating it - but it passed into the hands of the Irish government when he was unable to pay the mortgage he had taken out with a State-owned bank.

The property was finally sold to an unidentified buyer, said to be a foreign businessman, for £35million in October 2011.

Updown Court is situated in a 58-acre estate, with 24 bedrooms, a 50-seat cinema, six swimming pools and a heated marble driveway.

It boasts decadent luxury features such as mosaics made out of real gold, and more practical amenities including a panic room and escape tunnels.

The house featured in the 2010 film Green Zone, starring Matt Damon, where it portrayed a palace in Baghdad.
