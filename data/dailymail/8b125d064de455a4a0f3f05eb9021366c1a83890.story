Admittance: An attorney for Armando Gabriel Perez, 39, pleaded innocent in the stabbing death of his young wife moments before he yelled out being guilty

It was a shocking outburst by a man accused of killing his young wife that sent the victim's family into tears.

Armando Gabriel Perez, 39, accused of murdering his estranged wife of just nine-months in San Diego, California in 2010 shouted out a plea of guilty during his first court appearance on Wednesday.

Because of a state law defendants are not allowed to plead guilty during a felony arraignment, prompting his attorney to enter a conflicting plea of innocence for him in the stabbing death of 19-year-old Diana Gonzalez.

'Why did you tell me to plead not guilty, man?' Perez could be heard while filing out of the room according to KPBS.

'I'm guilty, all right? I'm guilty!'

His outburst was followed by Ms Gonzalez' sister standing up and cursing at him in Spanish in between sobs.

Perez
is accused of murdering Ms Gonzalez, the mother of their daughter Chrystal who was just several months old at the time of the killing in October of 2010.

Prosecutors say Perez then said goodbye to his children from a
previous relationship and fled to Mexico for more than a year to escape the charges.

Perez
allegedly stalked Ms Gonzalez at the San Diego City College where she 
was attending an evening class for nursing on the night of her death.

With her family waiting for her outside, a round-the-clock precaution enlisted for her safety her family said, police said he dragged her into a men's restroom before stabbing her multiple times.

Two weeks before her death she had filed a restraining order against him claiming he had kidnapped her for three days during which he raped and strangled her.

Her family said that it was only after she promised Perez reconciliation if he brought her back to her parents’ home that he let her go. After her release, she pressed charges instead.

He was arrested but not charged and released days later after District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis said there wasn't enough evidence to try him.

‘She was scared. She knew that something else probably could happen to her,’ her sister Janette Gonzalez told KPBS last year.

Speaking after Perez' court appearance on Wednesday, Ms Dumanis expressed her grief over Ms Gonzalez' death but pointed all blame back at Perez.

'I am very, very deeply sorry for this loss and I think the community is sorry for this loss. We did what we are legally required to do. The one that's responsible for this is Armando Perez,' she said, according to KPBS.

Captured near downtown Tijuana, Mexico in February, after 16 months on the run, Perez was extradited back to the U.S. on condition prosecutors would not to seek the death penalty.

He faces a maximum of life behind bars without parole.

Admittance: Seen during an interview from prison Perez said that he lost it on the day of Ms Gonzalez's death and he acted in a way that wasn't him

In a jail-house interview with Perez, he told NBC7 that on the day of Ms Gonzalez's death he completely 'lost it' and wasn't himself, saying the murder was neither planned nor a crime of passion.

'Diana 
didn't deserve this and that's why I'm here. There's no justification; I'm not 
saying excuses. In my case I think the only thing I would say is that I'm 
guilty. But not of first degree murder,' he said.

'I'm 
sorry. I always will be sorry, no matter if I die tomorrow or whatever,' he added. 'I love 
her and I always will love her. And her family, I'm real sorry.'

Speaking after his arraignment on Wednesday, Ms Gonzalez's cousin Beatriz Luna read a statement prepared by family expressing their grief and hopes for full justice in her death.

'Death would be fair, but we have to leave that aspect of human life to its creator,' she said according to KPBS. 'What we do wish for this murderer is the maximum penalty, that he never sees the light of day again, just like Diana will never see it.'
