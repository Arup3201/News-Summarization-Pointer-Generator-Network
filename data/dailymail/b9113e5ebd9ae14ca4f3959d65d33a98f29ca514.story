An endless, steep road spirals up ahead of me and in the heat of the Ibiza sun it seems insurmountable... until a somewhat over-enthusiastic Spencer Matthews sprints straight past me.

Yes, it seems the secret to his rock-hard abs and enviable tan is impossible runs up the mountains of the White Isle, where he is doing anything but partying into the wee small hours.

I have signed up to No1 Bootcamp, the retreat tucked into a beautiful sprawling farmhouse near the coastal town of Santa Eulalia.

The before and after shots showed the difference the Ibiza camp made to Spencer's figure

It is famed as the bootcamp to the stars (alumni include  X-Factor contestants, model Calum Best and former Atomic Kitten Natasha Hamilton). And as if to prove a point, the indomitable Made in Chelsea stalwart turns up unannounced on my first day. 

We're a nervous bunch at 7am as we stand in our lycra waiting to meet Andy Morris - a former personal training instructor in the RAF.

We had all arrived at different times the day before, dropped off at this picture-perfect villa Casona Morna, where its fragrant gardens give way to a beautiful pool and an outdoor seating area makes the perfect spot for al fresco lunch and dinner.

Casona Morna is located near the pretty Ibiza town of Santa Eulalia, not far from the beach

Relaxation time is spent on loungers around the pool in the villa's pretty gardens

Just down the road is the beach - where Andy hosts classes when he feels we need a change of scene - and all around are rolling hills criss-crossed by hiking routes which we explore in the afternoons.

A bundle of energy with the essential booming voice that every instructor needs, Andy has us all weighed, measured and taking part in a basic series of exercises as an introductory fitness test before we have even had breakfast.

When we do eventually sit down my serving of porridge looks decidedly small as he talks us through the week - 7am intensive workouts for 20 minutes, three-hour hikes, swimming pool-based activities, boxing classes, team games and endurance work-outs on the beach are just some of the highlights.

And we'll be doing all this while on a severely calorie-controlled diet. Our amazing chef and nutritionist Kate will be serving up three meals a day and snacks, but it will all be sugar, gluten and dairy-free. My stomach rumbles in sympathy.

As it turns out, the food is delicious. For the first 48 hours I feel hungry and have a slight headache - all part of the detox process apparently - but soon enough I start feeling fulfilled by the meals and we certainly have a great mix of foods, from hamburgers and 'chips' (sweet potato) to fish, salad, stuffed peppers and frittata.

There are 13 of us in my group and we create a whole spectrum of shapes and sizes. Of the four men, Spencer is at the fitter end of the scale, while others admit they work long hours and don't have the chance to work out.

Among us females we have everything from a professional stunt woman looking to hone her shape, to a slim girl who just wants to get fitter and an overweight woman who is keen to kick-start her weight-loss. The rest of us could just do with losing a few pounds.

Thankfully, the variety means we're not pitted against each other. Andy is quick to tell us we are only competing with ourselves. Some of us excel during the running and endurance training, others are great when it comes to weights.

I learn an entirely new workout vocabulary. It's all about maintaining form (basically, making sure you do the exercises properly and don't do yourself a mischief). 

We interchange High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT - where you blast through exercises with 100 per cent, but it's all over quite quickly) with isometric training (strength training focusing on one muscle or group of muscles). 

Despite the somewhat alien terminology, we're all soon using the jargon and Andy takes care to explain exactly what each class is doing for our bodies and why it is perfectly balanced with the previous exercise circuit. Don't be fooled though, he's not all friendly and cuddly - don't let him catch you slacking off.

When Andy decides the group needs a change of scene, he moves the workouts to the nearby beach

Porridge with figs, a healthy burger and sweet potato chips and a stuffed pepper keep us full of energy

Bircher muesli, a refreshing salad and a delicious Thai prawn curry are also on the menu in Ibiza

Thankfully, it's not all high-octane. Between classes we're given time to recover, some people swim, others sunbathe and I drag my bruised and battered body into the shade for a nap.

By day three I am pretty sure my body is about to give up on me altogether. Walking up the 10 stairs to my bedroom (there is a choice of sharing rooms or having one to yourself) takes about five minutes. Even rolling over in bed sends shooting pains through my muscles.

But somehow in each class I manage to find myself working through the exercises.

Perhaps Andy terrifies my muscles into submission, but by the end of day three they suddenly start easing up again. This is helped in no small part by a massage booked with local therapists who come to the villa for bookings (it is the best €70 I have ever spent).

After a particularly strenuous walk, Spencer cools down with an impromptu shower from a local spring

Throughout my personal ups and downs, Spencer remains irritatingly energetic. He is the first to finish exercises, the fastest runner and the most likely to whip off his top in the heat (well, it is a female-dominated group and he has ladies to impress - even the red and sweaty ones).

06:00 Wake-up time (this was a little later during my stay in Ibiza)

07.00 Short, intense 20-minute workout

07:30 A healthy breakfast to kick start the day

08:30 First full class of the day

10:00 Snack and a short break

10:30 Circuit training or similar

12:00 Lunch & much needed break

13:30 A long countryside hike

16:30 Team games & exercises

17:30 Stretching & similar exercises

19:30 A well-deserved gourmet dinner

Which is how I find myself being overtaken by the Chelsea resident while tackling a particularly steep hill. 

We are on one of our final hikes, a favourite activity of mine which allows us to ramble all over the countryside, taking in sea views from clifftops and clambering through forest paths, with the intense smell of pine trees all around. 

Our final hike ends with a devastatingly steep road which Andy has the bright idea of making us run up. We take off full of enthusiasm, round a corner and see that it seemingly goes on forever. 

Chest heaving, muscles straining and mentally making a note to kill our instructor, I haul myself up, only for Spencer to come bounding past, giving a thumbs up to the camera (Andy also loves nothing more than filming his victims - I mean participants - for a surprisingly touching montage to be shown at the end of the week).

At the top there are high fives all-round, shout-outs to those bringing up the rear and even a few sweaty hugs. 

For our final night, we're allowed 'off-campus' and into town for a dinner of our choice and even a sneaky glass of wine. But Kate and Andy have cleverly organised it so that our final weigh-in is the following morning, so we're desperate not to over-indulge.

Small groups mean that everyone gets the attention they need and the chance to bond while taking part in the activities, such as the three-hour afternoon hikes

Despite the concentration of bootcamp on exercise and healthy lifestyles, we haven't been weighed in since our first day and there is little talk of 'diets' and body comparisons. Everyone just seems to get on with doing their best.

Prices at No1 Boot Camp Ibiza start at £850 for a week - for bookings go to www.no1bootcamp.com or ring 0208 504 4183. 

The Ibiza camp reopens for 2015 on March 28 and is open through till the end of October. No1 Boot Camp also runs weight loss retreats in Norfolk (open all year round) and Marrakech. 

So what's the verdict? Spencer loses a reasonable seven pounds this time around (he has previously lost a stone in one trip), our 'biggest loser' sheds an amazing 11 pounds. Quite a few hover around the seven pounds mark and I lose four, which isn't too bad.

Kate reminds us that we will probably go on losing a couple of pounds the following week and I find that actually, it's not the weight I'm worried about so much anymore. 

My arms feel more defined, I feel lighter in myself and my body feels less sluggish thanks to the leaner diet. To me that is much more valuable than a few lost pounds.
