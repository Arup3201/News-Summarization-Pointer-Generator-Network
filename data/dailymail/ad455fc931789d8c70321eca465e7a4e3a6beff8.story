Ronald de Boer says his brother Frank would be interested in taking the Manchester City job - but only after 2016.

Manuel Pellegrini finds himself under pressure after City fell six points behind leaders Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race and were eliminated from the Champions League by Barcelona on Wednesday night.

The Chilean could be dismissed in the summer, with Ajax boss De Boer, Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti and Atletico Madrid's Diego Simeone among those linked with the job.

De Boer, 44, has guided Ajax to four consecutive Eredivisie titles, though they are well behind PSV Eindhoven this season. And his brother Ronald believes he will soon be thinking about his future.

'Frank would be interested in managing Manchester City in the future,' he told talkSPORT.

'He's already said he will stay at Ajax until 2016. If Manchester City or Barcelona come for him he will stay.

'After that [2016], he is ready to take on a job like that.'
