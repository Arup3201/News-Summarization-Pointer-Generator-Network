A TV presenter in Serbia almost lost her job as a sports reporter because she was so attractive she was distracting the footballers she was reporting on.

The organisers of the television show dedicated to the Serbian capital Belgrade's team Red Star had been looking for a presenter for the show and decided to employ 25-year-old Katarina Sreckovic.

But they were less than impressed when her attempts to ask intelligent questions about the game fell on deaf ears with the footballers, who were apparently unable to concentrate on answering properly.

Katarina Sreckovic admitted her attractiveness had been an issue but players have now grown used to her. Pictured right is a photo she uploaded to social media with a caption that loosely translates to: 'Come on Star!'

She said: 'I admit it was a problem at the start but I think they've got used to me now. It was tough though because for a while it seemed as if they might not be able to work with me at all.

'I was also asked to go away a couple of times because I was a distraction on the pitch, and players complained that they couldn't concentrate.'

But she said she had fought her corner, and insisted that the players would eventually get used to her, and they did.

She said: 'I am really happy, because I am also a huge fan of Red Star and this is my dream job.'

In the past she used to date a junior player, but nowadays she has an non-footballer boyfriend who nevertheless is also a huge fan of the same club.

As well as being a passionate fan of football she is a graduate in Chinese and literature.

Red Star used to be European Champions at the beginning of the 1990s.

The club is now in a severe financial crisis, but is still one of the two most important clubs in the country and has the biggest fan base of supporters.
