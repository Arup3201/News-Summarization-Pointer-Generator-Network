Former Scotland captain Andy Nicol has criticised Vern Cotter’s decision to leave experienced back- row forwards Kelly Brown and John Barclay out of his Six Nations squad — while including a player who has never played a first-team game for Edinburgh.

The Scotland head coach on Tuesday defended his selection of New Zealand-born openside flanker Hugh Blake, one of four uncapped players from the capital club named in his 32-man squad ahead of next month’s opener in Paris.

But Sportsmail columnist Nicol fears Brown and Barclay have been discriminated against because they play outside Scotland, while the likes of 22-year-old Blake, currently on trial at Edinburgh, has been fast-tracked ahead of them.

‘We seem to be promoting players who have come in from New Zealand at the expense of John Barclay and Kelly Brown,’ said Nicol. ‘There are a number of players in the Scotland squad who play out the country but I think it’s very clear that your chances of playing are greatly heightened by playing for Edinburgh and Glasgow.

‘That might be the right thing to do, don’t get me wrong. I just think that, if you’re picking your best players for this Six Nations — and forget the World Cup, because if they’re good enough for the Six Nations, then you’re good enough for the World Cup — you pick your best players and I would have thought Kelly Brown and John Barclay in particular are two that would come in there.’

Cotter admitted he had only watched video analysis of Blake with the Highlanders of New Zealand and seen him live in one BT Premiership game with Melrose last weekend. Asked if that was enough evidence, he said: ‘That is probably where we back our instincts. There will probably be another loose forward included within the group later but let us see what he offers. Everything and everyone so far speaks positively for him.’

Cotter’s fellow New Zealander, who only moved to Scotland in December and qualifies through his Scottish grandparents, is included with other new boys Sam Hidalgo-Clyne, Ben Toolis and Hamish Watson.

‘My gut feeling is he gives us something we don’t have, something a little bit different to what John (Barclay) does,’ said Cotter. ‘Hugh gives us a bit more speed, more turnovers and the way we want the team to play we need speed, and we need initiative. We need to be able to tackle, able to change the course of games.’

Meanwhile, Brown tweeted that he had not given up hope of adding to his 65 caps for Scotland.

‘I am clearly disappointed to miss out on selection but I’ll keep plugging away,’ said the former captain. ‘Greig (Laidlaw) and the boys have the potential to do something special.’
