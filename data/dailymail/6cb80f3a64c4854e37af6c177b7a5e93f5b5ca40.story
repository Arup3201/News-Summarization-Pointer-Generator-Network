Sally sually avoided the scales, and was appalled to discover her weight had shot up to more than 11st

Sally Edwards was in for a shock when the nurse at her asthma clinic asked her to step on to the scales.

'My
 doctor had retired and I changed to a new surgery where they had an 
asthma clinic,' says Sally, 45, a hairdresser from Aldington in Kent.

'They
 saw on my notes that I suffered from asthma, but this was the first 
time anyone in the medical profession had weighed me.'

'She took a sharp breath and made a face, so I knew it wasn't good news,' says Sally.

Like
 many women, she usually avoided the scales, and was appalled to 
discover her weight had shot up to more than 11st. At only 5ft 2in tall 
this made her officially obese.

'The problem was that I didn't feel 
fat because the weight had crept on so gradually during and after my 
pregnancies,' says Sally. 'Then when the children left things on their 
plates, I'd pick at the leftovers.'

Sally was also struggling 
increasingly to manage her asthma, making simple tasks such as walking  
up the stairs and looking after  her children, Maizie, now 12, and 
Merrin, nine, more difficult.

The asthma clinic nurse advised her to
 lose weight and said it would reduce her asthma symptoms. It was a real
 wake-up call, says  Sally. 'I knew that I had to do something about it 
or my asthma would just get worse because I would become more immobile 
and reluctant to exercise.'

There is a clear link between obesity and
 asthma attacks, as Deborah Waddell, clinical lead nurse at the charity 
Asthma UK, explains: 'Obese people find their asthma much harder to 
control.'

It seems they don't respond as well to treatment as people 
who are a healthy weight. Indeed, a recent study by Royal Brompton 
Hospital in London, involving more than 600 patients at severe asthma 
clinics across the UK, found that patients with a BMI of more than 30 
were more likely to need the steroid prednisolone - used to reduce 
inflammation in the airways - and to resort to their inhalers more 
often.

But as Dr Andrew   Menzies-Gow, a consultant in respiratory 
medicine at Royal Brompton, says: 'Unfortunately, one of the 
side-effects of prednisolone is increased appetite and weight gain, so 
patients are more inclined to find activity difficult.

'It's a vicious circle, but if  an asthma sufferer can break that cycle and lose weight, the benefits will be obvious.'

Sally's
 asthma started when she was 19, triggered by a severe bout of flu. 
Upper respiratory infections are often caused by cold and flu viruses 
and are a common trigger of asthma.

Sally lost a stone-and-a-half and it made a huge difference, bringing the asthma under control

'I had the flu jab when I was 19, but I was one of the unlucky people who contracted the flu badly,' she says.

Her
 asthma started to affect her daily life. 'Getting up the stairs was 
very scary because the wheezing was so loud.  And it stayed at the same 
level in my 30s and into my 40s. I couldn't run after the children at 
the park.'

Since being diagnosed with asthma, Sally has used a brown 
preventer inhaler each morning to build up a constant level of 
protection and a stronger, fast-acting Ventolin version when symptoms 
worsen. This would tend to happen in winter, and also if she was 
stressed or had been in contact with pet hair, particularly rabbits.

As
 well as losing weight, Sally embarked on an exercise regimen - which 
can be a brave step for an asthma sufferer, as many worry that increased
 activity will spark an attack.

But, in fact, exercise is good for 
asthmatics because it improves their lung capacity. Done carefully, it 
shouldn't be risky. And, for Sally, the regimen has been a life-changer.

After seeking advice from the Asthma UK website, she took up jogging.

As
 well as running four miles three times a week, she started going to a 
weekly spinning class, while cycling short distances instead of using 
the car soon became part of  her routine.

'I lost a stone-and-a-half in eight months and it made a huge difference,' says Sally.

'It
 really brought the asthma under control and made the attacks less 
frequent and less severe - I have  just one a month instead of three a 
week.'

She can now also run up  the stairs. 'When I was 11st,  my 
body was struggling to  cope with the weight, especially climbing 
stairs, but the fitter you are, the stronger your  lungs become.'Sally's experience is backed up by Asthma UK.

'If
 you can exercise, this will expand the airways, and improve your lung 
function,' says Deborah Waddell. 'Following a low-fat, low-sugar diet 
and getting rid of weight, especially around the middle, will make a big
 difference. It's all about changing your behaviour and lifestyle.'

Andrew
 Menzies-Gow suggests that people with asthma should look closely at 
their whole lifestyle, stop smoking, avoid pets which aggravate the 
condition, and take up exercise gradually, especially walking, swimming 
and cycling.

When it comes to exercise, he recommends taking a 
friend with you when you first start, stopping your work-out to rest if 
wheezing starts and choosing gentle, age-appropriate exercises to begin.
 'Weight loss and exercise are not a magic bullet for asthma, but they can help enormously,' adds Dr Menzies-Gow.

As for Sally Edwards, she's delighted that her asthma is now under control.

But that day at the asthma clinic is so vivid and humiliating that she still steers clear of the scales.'I still don't weigh myself very often, but now I have a pair of size 12 jeans and I try them on once a week.

'I know that if they don't fit then I have to try just that bit harder to keep the weight off,' she says.
