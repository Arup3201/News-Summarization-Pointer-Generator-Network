Breach: Luxury hotel chain Mandarin Oriental is investigating a potential credit card breach at its hotels after customers reported fraudulent charges on their credit cards

Security: Sources told cybersecurity news website KrebsOnSecurity.com most, if not all, Mandarin hotels in the United States were likely involved

Mandarin Oriental has not yet disclosed how many of its hotels were affected nor how many customers reported fraudulent charges.

But the upscale chain operates hotels across the world including Paris, Shanghai, Hong Kong, London, New York, Miami, San Francisco, Prague, Boston, Las Vegas, Macau and Barcelona.  

The company has around two-dozen locations worldwide.

Mandarin Oriental is known for offering customers a host of amenities including dining, spa, and luxurious suites for prices that start at $850 per night for a basic room in New York City.

Sources told cybersecurity news website KrebsOnSecurity.com that most, if not all, Mandarin hotels in the United States were likely involved. 

The website said card details were probably stolen from  payment terminals at restaurants and other businesses located inside of these hotels — instead of from the front desk.
