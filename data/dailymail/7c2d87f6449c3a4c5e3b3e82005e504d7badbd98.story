A holidaymaker who fell seriously ill while on a dream holiday in the Dominican Republic has won a £20,000 pay out from Thomas Cook.

Mark Bidwell, 33, from Bristol, suffered lethargy, diarrhoea and abdominal pain while on the ‘nightmare’ trip with his pregnant partner Nicola Greathurst.

The father-of-two became unwell just five days into two-week stay at the four-star Bahia Principe Hotel in San Juan.

Mr Bidwell lost weight as a result of falling ill the holiday in October 2009, and says he still suffers ongoing health problems.

The builder sued tour operator Thomas Cook and this week, two weeks before the case was to go to trial, a £20,000 pay out was agreed.

Mr Bidwell said: ‘The holiday was a nightmare for both of us. The food was awful and we have both been put off travelling to the Dominican Republic ever again.

‘I regret ever staying at the hotel. It was a terrible experience for us and I am still suffering the consequences today as I am still experiencing ongoing symptoms.

‘I feel as though my life has completely changed and it will never be the same again.’

Ms Greathurst, who was 24 weeks pregnant with daughter Madison at the time of the holiday, was not unwell, but received a sum of cash from Thomas Cook at an earlier date.

Irwin Mitchell, which represented the family, has now secured more than £5.5m in settlements for holidaymakers who have stayed at the hotel since 2007.

Amandeep Dhillon, spokesman for the legal firm, said: ‘We are pleased that Mark's case has been settled and that both of them can now move forward and put their awful experience behind them.

‘Sadly, we have had a long history of having to take legal action due to illness at this hotel.

‘This was meant to be a relaxing luxurious holiday for the couple before the arrival of their baby, and they had worked hard to save for it but instead Mark fell badly ill and they were unable to enjoy the facilities the resort had to offer.

‘Severe gastric illness can lead to long-term health problems and it is essential that the appropriate health and safety guidelines are followed to prevent illness to guests at hotels wherever they may be in the world.’

A spokesman for Thomas Cook said: 'Thomas Cook is sorry that Mr Bidwell fell ill while on holiday at the Bahia Principe Hotel in San Juan, Dominican Republic in October 2009.

'We have extended our apologies to the party, while reaching an agreement with their legal representatives.

'We would like to assure customers that incidents of this type are rare, as Thomas Cook closely audits all the properties to which it operates to ensure that only the very highest hygiene standards are maintained.'
