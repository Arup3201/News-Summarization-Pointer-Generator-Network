Tragic: Emily Harris, 18, who died in a blaze investigators believe was started by clothing which fire after it was left too close to an electric heater

A teenager burned to death while pet-sitting at her grandparents' home when clothing left to close to an electric heater burst into flames, an inquest heard.

Emily Harris, 18, was so badly burned by the fire at the house in Aberdare, South Wales, that she could only be identified by her dental records and one of her favourite bracelets.

Investigators believe the blaze caught hold after clothing fell on an electric heater. A sudden rush of air caused the smouldering garments to burst into a raging fire, trapping the student in an upstairs bedroom.

Just a lock of her hair survived the blaze intact.

Miss Harris, who had hoped to become a childcare worker, had offered to stay alone in her grandparents five-bedroom home to look after their pets while they were away on holiday.

The inquest was told Miss Harris had spent the night of October 17 last year with friends at pubs in Aberdare and returned to the house alone at midnight.

Her friend Gabriella Davies told the hearing: 'We chatted and were having fun - there were no issues.

'Emily was not falling down drunk and was just a bit tipsy.

'A friend drove her home and she made her way to the front door - I believe she was home safe and well.'

It was not until seven hours later that neighbours saw flames shooting from the first floor of the modern detached house. Fire crews were on the scene in two minutes but took two hours struggling to bring the blaze under control.

The property was so unstable rescuers could not bring Miss Harris’s body out until the following day. The cause of her death was given as smoke inhalation and burns.

Miss Harris's family learned of her death early on the morning of the fire after her sister received a phone call to ask if everyone was okay.

Simon Harris, her father, said in a written statement: 'This was the first we knew - we were then informed that Emily had passed away inside the house.

'The police later gave us a lock of Emily’s hair which we will keep forever.'

Fire investigator Andrew Sargeant told the hearing: 'The cause of the fire is likely to be one or more of the electric heaters placed too close to clothing, or clothing having fallen on one fo the fires.

'It falls in line with a small smouldering fire burning in the room for some time before more oxygen breaking into the room turned it into a raging fire which has spread through the house.'

Emily’s grandparents Keith and Ann Harris, who were on holiday in Tenby, West Wales, returned home after hearing of the tragedy.

Aberdare coroner Andrew Barkley said: 'It is highly probably that the fire started in the bedroom where Emily was found, either by an electric fire or halogen heater coming too close to something.

'It is a distinction which hardly matters - all other possibilities have been excluded.'

Miss Harris, of Aberdare, South Wales, was training to be a childcare worker and had just passed her driving test.

'She loved to drive and to listen to music, watch films and socialise with her friends,' said her father.

Tributes were paid to 'happy and smiling' Miss Harris at Aberdare Girls’ School, which she had only left months earlier.

Headteacher Jane Rosser said: 'She was a delightful pupil who always had a smile on her face.

'Emily was kind and caring to all around her - she was a lovely girl.'

The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.
