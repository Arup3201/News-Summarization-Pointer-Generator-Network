More than 20 villages in Russia's most remote and inhospitable region are populated almost entirely by men, new official figures have revealed.

The tiny villages in vast Krasnoyarsk region do not have a single female, according to Russian census results.

They are some of the most remote habitations in the world and several have only one resident, while others have no more than four or five men, reportsÂ The Siberian Times.

The villages of Kasovo, Novy Lokatui 
and Lokatui all have just one male resident each, say official 
statistics, while Ilinka has just three.

Temperatures in the brutal region swing between sub-Arctic temperatures of -40C in winter and short but viciously hot summers.

'One thing you can say about our men is that they are real men,' said a government spokeswoman.

'This region doesn't suit everyone.'

Though starkly beautiful, Krasnoyarsk is an unforgiving region that is frozen in winter and bakes in summer

The sex imbalance was revealed on Fatherland Defender's Day, an annual event that honours the role of men every February 23.

The figures are even more mystifying because the Krasnoyarsk region, the second largest in Russia, has 193,000 more women than men.

Many of the 23 male-only villages are in Emelyanovsky district, an area of 7,400 square kilometres close to the regional capital of Krasnoyarsk, a city of nearly a million people.

Others are far more remote, swallowed by a region that would be the world's 12th largest country if it was an independent state.

The reason they are exclusively inhabited by men is not clear, but the survey produces other intriguing insights. For example, across the region there are eight single fathers taking care of five or more children.

Russia has a gender imbalance towards women, with only 86 men for every 100 women.
