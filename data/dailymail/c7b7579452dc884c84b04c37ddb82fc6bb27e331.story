Bendigo councillor Mark Weragoda, who voted in favour of a controversial Mosque application, woke up on Thursday to find black balloons tied to the front of his business

For the past few weeks, residents of Bendigo, Victoria have been noticing black balloons appearing around the town tied to trees, houses and office fronts.

The balloons are being left by a vocal group of anti-Islam protesters furious about plans to build a mosque in the regional city, after a controversial development proposal was debated and approved at a council meeting on Wednesday night.

Councillors voted 6-2 to approve the $3 million development which will serve the 200 Muslim residents of East Bendigo and will include a mosque, sports hall, education facilities and retail premises.

At the meeting protesters made a lot of noise, yelling that mosque would bring terrorists and Sharia Law to the town.

On Thursday morning local councillor Mark Weragoda, who voted in favour of the application, woke up to find black balloons tied to the front of his business, where he also lives.

'I was a bit appalled really given the antics the anti-Muslim group made at the council chamber while we were debating,' Cr Weragoda, who is of Sri Lankan origin, told MailOnline.

'I thought "This is obviously targeting me personally."

'I've had a few phone calls and a few slanderous remarks at the chamber but anyway that's democracy I guess.'

Cr Weragoda said the group protesting were a minority group trying to make 'as much noise as possible'.

The development application received 254 objections, compared to Bendigo's total population of 110,000

'For instance they were so woeful, they wouldn't actually let any of the supportive councillors speak without yelling out every second,' he said.

'When I spoke they actually played some Muslim music.'

Cr Weragoda added that the development application received 254 objections, compared to Bendigo's total population of 110,000.

Cr Weragoda, who is originally from Sri Lanka, said he felt personally targeted by abuse from anti-mosque protesters

Of the 254 objections to the mosque, 40 came from East Bendigo residents, 163 came from Greater Bendigo and the rest came from elsewhere in Victoria or interstate.

Two councillors, Elisa Chapman and Helen Leach, voted against the mosque.

Cr Chapman told MailOnline: 'I'm not interested in speaking to media because they twist everything I say.'

Cr Leach said she voted against the mosque and two other proposals 'purely on planning grounds'.

'I wasn't satisfied I could make a decision on that and two others, given the information in the report,' she told MailOnline.

Cr Leach wanted to see more information on the neighbourhood impact, car parking and traffic issues.

She added that she didn't think there was proper consultation with the community about the mosque.

'I don't know what all of the fuss is about really, I think it's just democratic process,' she said.

Objectors to the mosque are likely to apply for a review of the mosque's planning application with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, which could stall the development for months

'I suppose people are concerned they haven't been heard and they think they should have been heard, and perhaps if they had they wouldn't have been so angry.'

A spokesperson for community group Stop The Mosque In Bendigo, whose Facebook page has attracted more than 7700 likes, said it was opposed to the development because it is concerned the Muslim Brotherhood is trying to take over Australia for Islam.

'In my opinion a mosque preaching jihad and sedition decreases the security of any town,' they told MailOnline.

'No mosque should be allowed to preach sedition of submission of unbelievers - but this is a core belief of Islam and why we at Stop the Mosque are so against it and spend energy educating others.'

They added that the mosque's planning application had a 'litany of irregularities' and there was no community consultation.

Bendigo resident Damian Wells, 35, said he was embarrassed that his town was being portrayed as racist and intolerant, so he started a Change.org petition to support multiculturalism and diversity in the regional city.

'It's just totally unrepresentative of Bendigo and what Bendigo's about,' Mr Wells said.

'It really makes me get wound up to think about the possibly that we're seen as not a welcoming community.'

'[The petition] is really about the silent majority standing up to this loud minority, which is just full of hatred and which is not representative of the Bendigo I love.'

Consulting firm Tomkinson Group made the application to council on behalf of the Bendigo Islamic Association and the Australian Islamic Mission, which will fund the mosque.

Tomkinson Group's Munshi Nawaz said objectors to the mosque were likely to apply for a review of the mosque's planning application with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, which could stall the development for months. Â 

'It is very likely given that there are some major concerns among the community,' Mr Nawaz told MailOnline.

'In relation to this specific mosque application it's normal that people may have different views and they have the right to express them, it's all good.'

Mr Nawaz said the Muslim population of Bendigo was growing quickly and the Bendigo Islamic Association anticipated this would continue.

'Roughly I can remember say five or six years ago there were approximately five to 10 Muslim families here, whereas now there are currently 50 who are permanently living in Bendigo,' he said.
