Whether you are grabbing a takeaway coffee, or flicking through a magazine, it is almost impossible not to encounter adverts or brands.

But a prototype headset that can block out brands has been created, meaning that people may be able to ‘opt out of corporate influence’ in the future.

A group of four students developed the device during a hackathon, to help people who ‘feel helpless against the dominance of ads in society today.’

A prototype headset that can block out brands has been created, meaning that people may be able to ‘opt out of corporate influence’ in the future. The 'Adblock for Real Life' can be seen blurring out the logo on a coffee cup (left) while the image on the right doesn't have the feature switched on

The headset is called ‘Brand Killer: Adblock for Real Life’ and comprises a pair of goggles with a seven inch display inside and a camera, running on Open CV and Python software.

It uses computer vision to recognise brands, such as Starbucks, which are logged in a database.

Once any of the recognisable brands come into view, the system pixelates them.

‘It’s Adblock for real life,’ the team of computer scientists said.

They developed the idea at the University of Pennsylvania's PennApps Winter 2015 hackathon, describing the headset as: ‘a technology demonstration that envisions a future in which consumers can use augmented reality to opt out [of] corporate influence.’

The team originally set out to overlay brands with generic labels such as ‘cereal’ instead of ‘Lucky Charms,’ for example but ran out of time, as they built the headset over one weekend and only spent $80 (£53)

The headset is called ‘Brand Killer: Adblock for Real Life'.

It comprises a pair of goggles with a seven inch display inside and a camera, running on Open CV and Python software.

It uses computer vision to recognise brands, such as Starbucks, which are logged in a database.

Once any of the recognisable brands come into view, the system pixelates them.

‘It’s Adblock for real life,’ the team of computer scientists said.

The headset cost $80 (£53) and was built over one weekend.

Despite a positive response to an ad-free world, its creators say there are no plans to use or sell the gadget.

Team member Alex Crits-Christoph, a Biophysics student at Johns Hopkins University, said: ‘This idea was inspired by the British TV show Black Mirror, in which one episode features a future in which certain people are literally blocked out from the lives of others using augmented reality technology.’

The team decided to use a similar idea to empower people and let them block out advertising, which Mr Crits-Christoph described as ‘an eyesore and overwhelmingly present in society today’.

They originally set out to overlay brands with generic labels such as ‘soda’ instead of ‘Dr Pepper,’ for example but ran out of time, as they built the headset over one weekend and only spent $80 (£53).

‘We also planned to target billboards and full-adverts, but also did not finish that in the competition.’

The team also considered replacing adverts with artwork.

While the headset was only developed to demonstrate the potential of current technology in augmented reality, it was received positively by people keen to block out adverts from their lives.

Mr Crits-Christoph said:‘Around 30 people tried the headset on when we demoed it at PennApps, and almost every one smiled or laughed at the effect.

‘The positive response from the Internet has been wonderful.’

There are no plans to sell or use the headset (pictured) in day-to-day life. It is purely intended as ‘a statement about both technology and society'. However, it has been very well received. ‘I think that currently people feel helpless against the dominance of ads in society today,' Mr Crits-Christoph said

‘I think that currently people feel helpless against the dominance of ads in society today.

‘Possibly the response to the project has been so overwhelming because it has helped people imagine a world in which technology like this is used to empower individuals as one that is not too far off.’

Team member Jonathan Dubin told MailOnline: ‘The response to our technology indicates that people really identify with the goal of blocking ads in the real world.

‘I think many people have realised that brands are everywhere in our world, and the ability to exert some control over our surroundings rather than be helpless to the ads is empowering.’

‘People have been looking for practical uses of augmented reality, and I think that this, or variations of it, could be highly demanded.

‘People want the same freedom they have in their browsers, in the real world.’

Despite this, there are no plans to sell or use the headset in day-to-day life. It is purely intended as ‘a statement about both technology and society.’

When asked whether the technology could one day be embedded into a technology similar to Google Glass, Mr Dubin said: ‘I do think that developers will go ahead and build this technology for whatever augmented reality devices come out in the future.’
