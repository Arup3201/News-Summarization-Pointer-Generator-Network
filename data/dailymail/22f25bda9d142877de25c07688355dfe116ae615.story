There have been nine English players to try their luck in Italy’s Serie A since 1990. And as Ashley Cole will find out, while it’s not impossible to be a success - it is extremely difficult:

New boy: Ashley Cole is hardly the first Englishman in Italy - but how did the others get on?

DAVID BECKHAM – AC MILAN (2009-10)

Games: 29, Goals: 2

Goldenballs had two loan spells in Milan towards the end of his career with the purpose of forcing his way into England’s World Cup squad. His first alongside Kaka, Ronaldinho and Andrea Pirlo was moderately successful and he returned the following year to the disapproval of fans at his parent club, Los Angeles Galaxy. Beckham played against Manchester United in the Champions League but then tore his left Achilles tendon against Chievo and was ruled out of the World Cup.

VERDICT: FAIL

Big club: Beckham poses in Milan's famous trophy room ahead of his unveiling at the San Siro

Same old: Beckham bends in one of his famous free kicks in a game against former club Manchester United

Injury: But his second spell in Milan ended in agony as he tore his Achilles tendon against Chievo

JAY BOTHROYD – PERUGIA (2003-05)

Games: 28, Goals: 5

Bothroyd was just 21 when he made the eye-catching move from Coventry City to Serie A. Though the football didn’t go great – he returned to England for a loan spell with Blackburn Rovers the year after he left – it was an  interesting life experience, befriending Colonel Gadaffi’s son Saadi who was also on Perugia’s books and collecting the shirts of illustrious opponents like Paolo Maldini and Andriy Shevchenko.

VERDICT: FAIL

High flyer: Bothroyd fights it out with Maik Franz of Wolfsburg in an Intertoto Cup game

Useful: During his brief spell in Serie A the former Coventry hitman managed to bag five goals

Battler: Bothroyd fights for the ball against Dundee's David Mackay in a UEFA Cup tie

FRANZ CARR – REGGIANA (1996-98)

Games: 6, Goals: 0

Carr, the former speed king of Nottingham Forest, was pushing 30 when he went to Italy with lowly Reggiana and hardly made a big impression. He joined on a free transfer from Aston Villa but after just a handful of games was back in England to play on loan at Bolton Wanderers.

VERDICT: FAIL

Transformation: Carr was the king of speed for Forest but was a flop at Reggiana

DANNY DICHIO – SAMPDORIA/LECCE (1997-98)

Games: 12, Goals: 4

Arguably Serie A’s unlikeliest English import, Sampdoria thought the 6ft4ins Dichio would give them something different up front but the former QPR striker’s technical limitations meant he didn’t last.  Sven Goran Eriksson signed Dichio but left soon after the striker arrived, so he went on loan to Lecce.

VERDICT: FAIL

On the rocks: Danny Dichio had spells at Sampdoria and Lecce

Boy in blue: Dichio shows his colours in a Sampdoria photoshoot

PAUL GASCOIGNE – LAZIO (1992-95)

Games: 43, Goals: 6

To tell the whole story, you’d need to write a book. Gazza arrived in Rome a year after originally planned after rupturing his cruciate in the 1991 FA Cup final. His time in Italy was dogged with injury and weight problems but he scored a vital goal in the derby against Roma and is still idolised by Lazio fans.

VERDICT: SUCCESS

Fans' man: Gazza instantly made himself popular with Lazio fans after turning up in this outfit

Culture: The English box of tricks poses in front of Rome's Colosseum after signing from Tottenham

Hero: Gascoigne scored against Roma which means he is still loved by Lazio fans to this day

PAUL INCE – INTER MILAN (1995-97)

Games: 54, Goals: 10

Manchester United’s self-styled Guv’nor showed he could walk the walk by impressing in Serie A under future England manager Roy Hodgson. Ince rose above the racist taunting that came from sections of Italian crowds and helped the club finish third in the league and reach the Uefa Cup final, which they lost to Schalke on penalties. Inter wanted him to stay longer but he returned home to sign for Liverpool.

VERDICT: SUCCESS

Excitement: Ince poses with his adidas boots and an Inter Milan shirt as he signs in 1995

Popular: Inter wanted to keep hold of Ince but he decided to return to England with Liverpool

DAVID PLATT – BARI, JUVENTUS, SAMPDORIA (1991-95)

Games: 100, Goals: 31

Probably England’s most successful player in Italy, Platt was signed by Bari from Aston Villa in the post-Italia 90 boom and did so well he ended up moving on to Juventus and then Sampdoria, who valued his goalscoring prowess from midfield. The highlight came at Sampdoria when he won the Italian Cup under Sven Goran Eriksson and developed a close friendship with team-mate Roberto Mancini. Unlike many Brits, Platt became a fluent Italian-speaker which helped him settle on and off the field.

VERDICT: SUCCESS

Brit abroad: Platt in action for Bari during a Serie A match in 1991

Winner: Platt picks up the UEFA Cup during his time with Juventus in 1990

Trilogy: Platt makes a run for his third Italian club, Sampdoria

LEE SHARPE – SAMPDORIA (1998-99)

Games: 3, Goals: 0

Sharpe was recovering from a bad knee injury and past his Manchester United prime when Leeds  United allowed him to go out on loan to Italy. He played only three games and returned to England after a few months, signing for Bradford City.

VERDICT: FAIL

Flop: Lee Sharpe watches on from the stands after signing for Sampdoria on loan

Reject: Sharpe made a quick return to Bradford City in England after an unsuccessful spell in Italy

DES WALKER – SAMPDORIA (1992-93)

Games: 30, Goals: 0

It was quite an honour for a leading club in Italy, where defending is regarded as an art form, to sign an English centre half from Nottingham Forest. Unfortunately, the move coincided with Walker starting to lose his famed pace and confidence. He played mainly left back in Genoa and soon his England career was over too, making his last international appearance at the age of 27.

VERDICT: FAIL

Happy days: Walker poses in a Sampdoria shirt after signing back in 1992 towards the end of his career

Hard man: Former England centre back Des Walker playing for Sampdoria in 1992
