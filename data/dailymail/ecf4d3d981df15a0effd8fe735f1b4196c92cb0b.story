A lift at a construction site killed 19 workers after it plummeted 30 floors in freefall.

The accident reportedly occurred when a cable broke, causing the metal contraption to plunge 328 feet (100 metres) down the tower.

All building work in Wuhan city, central China, has now been halted while the municipal government carries out security checks.

Growing too fast? Safety is a problem in China, where more than 75,500 people died in work-related accidents last year

The tower was part of a compound where several similar structures were being erected.

All of those who died were decorators working on the building, according to state broadcaster China Central Television.

Work safety is a big problem in China, where regulations are routinely ignored.

Although the government says it is taking measures to reduce fatalities, more than 75,500 people died in work-related accidents last year, according to the State Administration of Work Safety.

On Tuesday a man was lucky to survive 
when a metal bar went straight through his head as he walked through a 
construction site in Shangrao, China's eastern Jiangxi province.

He had decided to take a shortcut through the construction site early in the morning when a falling metal bar impaled through the back of his head and out of the front.

Builders called emergency services and firefighters used tools to cut off the long protruding ends of the bar, which was later removed in hospital. Incredibly, the man has recovered.

Last month, three people were killed and five 
injured when a motorway bridge in Heilongjiang province in north east
China collapsed, sending four huge trucks crashing 100ft to the 
ground below.

The collapse was one of a number of 
horrifying accidents on China's expanding road and rail networks in 
recent years - leading to fears that safety is being sacrificed for the 
speed of construction.

It was at least the sixth major bridge collapse across the country since July last year.

Two U.S. citizens were among the dead last December when a bullet train crashed off a bridge after leaving the Zhejiang provincial capital of Hangzhou

Dead bodies are loaded into ambulances on the site, while a member of the construction company is strong-armed by police into a nearby building for questioning

Days after last month's bridge collapse, 36 bus passengers were killed in a fireball when the vehicle
collided with tanker carrying methanol in northern China.

Road
safety is also a serious problem in China, with poorly maintained roads
and bad driving habits resulting in about 70,000 deaths and 300,000 
injuries a year, according to news agency Xinhua.

Just
a week after that, an explosion in a Chinese coal mine killed 26 miners
and left others trapped in the carbon monoxide-filled pit for a day.

China's
mines are the deadliest in the world thanks to the country's lax 
enforcement of safety standards, combined with the rush to feed demand 
from a burgeoning economy.
