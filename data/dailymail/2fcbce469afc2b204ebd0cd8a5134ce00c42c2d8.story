One of Scotland’s most notorious criminals, branded the 'acid monster' for organising a horrific attack which left his ex-wife disfigured, has been jailed for life after trying to stab a nightclub doorman.

Gordon Modiak was jailed for 20 years over the sickening acid attack on tragic Louise Duddy in Edinburgh in 1991.

But, after changing his name to Wood and moving to Blackpool to start a new life, the 56-year-old is now back behind bars after being caught on CCTV trying to stab a bouncer in the popular seaside resort.

Horrific: Louise Duddy was scarred and blinded from the attack, which shocked the Scotland

The dad-of-two flew into a rage over a remark that he’d be 'more comfortable' in a gay bar.

The attack comes 22 years after he masterminded a crime which shocked Scotland.

After a bitter split from his wife, he paid a hired thug to throw sulphuric accident in her face - while he calmly watched from a getaway car parked in a quiet Slateford street.

Ms Duddy, now 48, was blinded by the attack. Bizarrely, in his trial at Preston Crown Court, Modiak claimed he had merely pretended to stab the bouncer in order to draw attention to his continuing grievance over his conviction for the acid attack.

The court heard how his latest crime followed a similar pre-planned and disturbing pattern.

Modiak was drunk and smoking outside a bar called Ma Kellys on March 16 this year when he was asked to move away by door staff.

After spitting at the bouncers, he changed his clothes and put on a hat, returning in disguise an hour-and-a-half later with a large knife hidden from view.

In CCTV footage, Modiak is seen walking past the entrance of the bar - sizing up his intended victim - before doubling back.

He then pulls out the blade and lunges at bouncer Daniel Ursoi, 39.

Speaking after Tuesday’s sentencing, Mr Ursoi said: “He walked up to me and shouted, ‘Do you remember me?’ then launched at me with the knife.

'I remember thinking, "Oh God". I was so lucky the knife missed me and just caught my sleeve.'

Mr Ursoi’s fellow doormen held on to the the thug until police arrived.

Sentencing Modiak to life in prison, Judge Graham Knowles QC said Modiak could easily have killed Mr Ursoi. He said: 'You are an extremely dangerous man, you present a serious risk of harm to members of the public.

'You have no concept of how people see you, including the jury.

'That was evident with you defence - you said you pretended to stab the man so you would be arrested and get the attention you deserve for what you call the ‘miscarriage of justice’ that happened in Scotland.'

He was convicted of attempted grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of a bladed article.

He was ordered to serve a minimum of five years and 124 days before being eligible for parole.
