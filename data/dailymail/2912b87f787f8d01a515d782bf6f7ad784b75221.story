A father desperate to prevent his children suffering has launched a clinical trial into a treatment he believes could stop their rare disease progressing.

Nick Sireau, 40, believes he has found a drug that could stop his sons, Daniel, 10, and Julien, 13, developing any symptoms.

Both have 
Black Bone Disease – also known as Alkaptonuria (AKU) – which causes 
their urine and bones to turn black.

If the drug trial is successful, the pill could be offered to all patients with the same genetic condition.

The boys' father, Nick (pictured with Daniel), gave up his job in 2010 to help find a cure for the condition. He believes a treatment has now been identified and is about to launch a clinical trial

Dr Sireau told MailOnline: ‘We are really pleased. It’s fantastic.

‘We are really excited that the trial is about to start because there has been so much work to get to this point. We are also apprehensive even though we are pretty confident the results will be good.’

Without treatment, as they get older they will develop severe early-onset osteoarthritis and are at risk of brittle bones and heart disease.

The genetic disease also causes the bones, cartilage, urine and earwax to turn black.

Dr Sireau, from Cambridge, was so desperate to help his children that he gave up his job as CEO of a charity called SolarAid in 2010 to work for the AKU Society.

Currently Julien (right) and Daniel (left) are healthy but they will start to develop symptoms in early adulthood unless a treatment is found

He has now helped organise the clinical trial which he believes could offer a life-saving solution for his children, and for other AKU sufferers.

The trial, which will start on April 14, will see 42 patients attend a centre in Liverpool where half will be given the drug Nitisinone.

The drug is already licenced to treat patients with another rare disease and could become widely available to AKU patients if the trial is successful in showing it can stop the disease progressing.

In total, 70 patients will be given the drug during the four year trial which will be run from centres in Liverpool, Paris and Slovakia.

The medical side of the trial is being funded by the European Commission but the organisers had to raise $98,000 to pay for patient transport, carers for the more disabled patients and to provide support for patients.

They achieved this in the autumn meaning the trial can now start.

If the trial is successful, the treatment could be made available on the NHS within the next five years.

The trial organisers hope it could stop the disease progressing in older patients who already have symptoms and that it could prevent symptoms developing in younger patients.

They say patients would just need to take a tablet each day for the rest of their lives.

Dr Sireau said: ‘Personally, this means hope for my kids and for all of the patients.

‘We hear the most horrible stories of people having to stop work and becoming depressed because of the symptoms.

‘For me, it is important my kids don’t suffer this pain.’

The boys are currently healthy but without treatment will eventually start to develop symptoms such as joint problems and back pain – the early symptoms of osteoarthritis.

These symptoms could develop at any time from their mid-teens to their 40s.

The osteoarthritis suffered by Black Bone Disease patients is caused by a toxic acid called homogentisic acid (HGA) attacking their bones and cartilage, turning them black and brittle.

In people with AKU, the acid accumulates at 2,000 times the normal rate.

Julien was diagnosed as a baby when his parents noticed his nappies were black - until then they did not realise they carried the gene mutation. There was a 25 per cent chance Daniel would also be affected

This also causes discolouration of the ears and black spots in the eyes.

There is also a growing link between AKU and heart disease.

This is because toxic acid called homogentisic acid HGA causes the blood vessels and valves in the heart to harden, turning them black, brittle and less effective at managing the flow of blood around the body.

Although this is still believed to be an uncommon symptom of AKU, it is a potentially fatal consequence of the disease.

AKU can also cause several other symptoms, such as kidney, prostate and bladder stones, black or dark sweat or a blue speckled discolouration of the skin.

However, the clinical trial gives hope that all sufferers of Black Bone Disease will soon be able to live a normal life without developing any symptoms.

Dr Sireau (pictured with Julien) believes the drug Nitisinone could prevent acid building up in patients and, therefore, prevent symptoms developing. The drug is already used to treat another rare disease

Dr Sireau believes Nitisinone could prevent HGA building up in patients and, therefore, prevent symptoms developing.

He told MailOnline: ‘My hope is that my children never have to feel the pain of the symptoms – that they just won’t have to worry about it.’

Just after Julien was born, Dr Sireau and his wife, Sonya, noticed that his nappies were turning black.

They called an emergency doctor who thought the problem was caused by his mother eating red cabbage and then breastfeeding him.

However, his parents were not convinced so took him to a GP who sent a range of tests to Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital.

When the tests were analysed, they revealed that Julien has Black Bone Disease which is a genetic disorder caused by a recessive gene.

Dr Sireau said: ‘It took a lot of time to sink in. Doctors told us there was nothing we could do – that was very disempowering.

‘It took us a while to start realising that we could do something.’

Dr Sireau (pictured with Daniel) said: 'Personally, this means hope for my kids and for all of the patients. We hear the most horrible stories of people having to stop work and becoming depressed because of the symptoms. For me, it is important my kids don't suffer this pain'

When the couple had their second child, Daniel, they knew there was a 25 per cent chance that he would also have the condition.

Dr Sireau explained that after he was born, they kept checking his nappies for fear they too would go black.

He said: ‘We were checking Daniel’s nappies again and again. It was so sad when it happened but we try to be positive.

‘We are given a chance to find a cure because the disease doesn’t affect them as children.’

Black Bone Disease, also known as Alkaptonuria (AKU), is a rare genetic disease which causes early-onset osteoarthritis.

It is caused by the lack of an enzyme called homogentisic dioxygenase which means that patients cannot fully breakdown a toxic acid called homogentisic acid.

As a result, the acid builds up in the body at 2,000 times the normal rate.

The first symptom is usually black urine. Other symptoms do not usually develop until the patient is in their 20s.

At this stage, the patients tend to develop joint problems and back pain which is the start of osteoarthritis.

This eventually causes the bones to become brittle and can be very disabling.

The condition can also cause the eyeballs, sweat and earwax to turn black.

It is thought there is also a link between AKU and potentially fatal heart disease.

This is because HGA causes the blood vessels and valves in the heart to harden, turning them black, brittle and less effective at managing the flow of blood around the body.

AKU is caused by a genetic mutation - it is a recessive disorder meaning the AKU gene must be carried by both of the patient's parents.

If both parents are carriers, there is a 25 per cent chance of their child developing the condition.

The condition is thought to occur in about one in every 250,000 to 500,000 people.
