At least six people died when a powerful cyclone ripped across huge swathes of India's eastern coast on Sunday - bringing heavy rain and strong winds that caused major damage to buildings and crops.

Cyclone Hudhud, one of two storms to hit Asia this weekend, was travelling at 120mph when it made landfall after sweeping through the Bay of Bengal.

At least 400,000 people were forced to flee their homes in the coastal states of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa ahead of the storm, where hundreds of shelters were set up to house the evacuees.

One person died in Visakhapatnam, one of the largest cities in southern India and a major naval base, when a wall collapsed. The other was killed when a tree toppled over in Srikakulam.

The cyclone's wind speed dipped to about 100mph, but was expected to pick up later on Sunday, according to Rear Admiral S.K. Grewal from India's Eastern Naval Command. 

Experts said the storm was likely to cause widespread devastation along nearly 300 kilometers 185 miles of India's east coast. 

Television footage from Visakhapatnam showed downed electrical poles, uprooted trees and massive debris strewn in the streets. Electricity lines were disconnected in parts of Andhra Pradesh to avoid electrocutions, said Arvind Kumar, a relief and rescue official.

Four districts in Andhra Pradesh that are home to more than 14 million people - Srikakulam, Vijayanagaram, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari - were expected to be worst hit, including about 350 coastal villages.

Andhra Pradesh's chief minister, N. Chandrababu Naidu, said that while the early evacuations had saved lives, the cyclone caused 'huge damage' to buildings and crops in the coastal districts.

Though the cyclone was expected to weaken over the weekend, heavy rain was expected to lash Orissa, pictured above, for three days

Grewal said 30 diving and 20 rescue teams were on standby. Hundreds of rescuers from India's National Disaster Response Force were also spread out across Andhra Pradesh and Orissa.

India's meteorological department said Sunday afternoon that the cyclone would weaken over the next 12 hours, with wind speeds gradually decreasing. 

But heavy rain was expected to lash Andhra Pradesh and Orissa for another three days. Other parts of central and northeastern India were also expected to see heavy rain.

The Indian Ocean is a cyclone hot spot. Of the 35 deadliest storms in recorded history, 27 have come through the Bay of Bengal - and have landed in either India or Bangladesh. In 1999, a cyclone devastated Orissa's coastline and killed at least 10,000 people.

Cyclone Hudhud struck as Typhoon Vongfong hit Japan's southern islands, injuring at least 31 people. Vongfong made landfall on the southern island of Okinawa and was aiming at the island of Kyushu, where authorities told 150,000 people to evacuate. It is expected to reach Tokyo by Tuesday.  

Strong winds from the storm knocked out power lines and toppled traffic signals and signposts on Sunday, and bullet train service was halted for several hours on Kyushu island. Authorities issued landslide warnings.

West Japan Railway Co., which operates trains in central Japan in the area surrounding the ancient capital of Kyoto, said that some train services would be shut down starting Monday afternoon because of the typhoon, and that the disruptions could continue through Tuesday.

The U.S. military on Okinawa, where last week's typhoon killed three U.S. airmen who were washed out at sea, instructed personnel and their families to remain indoors Sunday until strong winds and rain subsided.
