The son of martial arts movie star Jackie Chan has been arrested for marijuana possession at his Beijing home.

Jaycee Chan, 32, and his Taiwanese movie star friend Kai Ko, 23, were both detained by police after more than 3.5ounces of marijuana were found at Jaycee's home.

Jaycee is the son of Hong Kong-born movie legend Jackie Chan, who rose to fame in Chinese martial arts movies, as well as U.S.-produced films such as the Rush Hour series.

His son Jaycee, who was born and raised in the U.S., is an actor and singer himself who has appeared in a string of movies which have failed at the Chinese box office.

Chinese police confirmed they found the drugs at Jaycee's home and said the two arrested also tested positive for marijuana use.

Jaycee has had several run-ins with his father over the years and in 2011, Jackie Chan said he would not be leaving his fortune to his son upon his death, but donating it to charity in order to force his son to earn his own money.

The pair's arrest is the latest in a series of crackdowns by Beijing police on celebrity drug use.

Last week 42 Chinese entertainment and performance agencies agreed to boycott celebrities that took drugs and Chinese actor Gao Hu, 40, was arrested for possession of methamphetamine and cannabis.
