An 18-month-old boy has died in Berlin after suffering from measles becoming the first known death of the disease in an outbreak in the German capital.

Authorities believe the outbreak began with a child asylum-seeker from Bosnia, which spread to the wider population.

So far there have been 570 cases of measles in the city since October.

An autopsy on the toddler, who died last week but has not been named, revealed he wasn't immunised against the disease and was suffering another medical condition.

But the Charite Hospital added that is pre-exisitng health problems would not have led to his death.

Measles has spread so quickly as many older adults in Germany were never immunised against the disease and many younger adults did not receive the full course of the vaccine.

German health minister Hermann Groehe has called for increased efforts to ensure that children are vaccinated.

He has even suggested if that doesn't succeed, authorities might consider making it mandatory, though he said that isn't currently on the agenda.

Elsewhere a Berlin secondary school was closed as a precaution on Monday because a student had measles, but reopened Tuesday.

The toddler had been treated at the Charite hospital in Berlin, who said his pre-existing health condition would not have contributed to his death 

Officials checked students' and teachers' vaccination records and local health official Sibyll Klotz said five students who couldn't show that they were properly vaccinated were sent home.

Measles is highly contagious and health officials say more than 90 per cent of a population needs to be vaccinated to prevent outbreaks.

Vaccination rates across Europe fell after a now-discredited study that suggested a link between autism and the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella.

Health officials recommend immunisation in children at 12 to 15 months of age, followed by a second dose for full protection.

The second shot can be given either one month later or before the child starts school, at four to six- years-old, according to the Centers for Disease Control in the United States, which adopted the two-dose protocol in 1989.

The measles and SV rubeola viruses. It is thought the latest measles outbreak in Berlin originated from a sick child who travelled to Germany to seek asylum 

The measles vaccine was only developed about 50 years ago, which would explain why many older adults weren't immunised.

Germany has had a nationwide recommendation of a two-shot regimen only since 1991, so many younger adults may not have received the second dose.

The German measles outbreak coincides with smaller ones in the United States tied to Disneyland in California and an Illinois day care center, which in total make up less than 150 cases.

Officials say at least two of the measles cases in Berlin have been linked to the U.S. — one person who developed symptoms there before traveling to Germany, and another who developed the infection after returning from the U.S.
