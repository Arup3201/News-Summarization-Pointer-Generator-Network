Billionaire Elon Musk's groundbreaking private space firm SpaceX has been shaken up this past week by class action lawsuits filed on behalf of some angry former employees.

The suits come less than a month after SpaceX laid off up to 400 employees who spokesmen claimed were 'low performers,' but one of the suits says the unexpected mass terminations violated California law.

The other suit suggests working conditions weren't ideal leading up to the lay-offs, anyway, with claims the company failed to provide employees--even its technicians producing space rockets--with state mandated lunch and rest breaks.

Giant leap...to the curb? Two lawsuits claim billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX firm has violated California labor laws

In the second suit, disgruntled employee Joseph A. Smith alleges the company failed to provide required half-hour lunch breaks after five hours of work followed by a second break after 10 hours, CNN reports.

Smith's suit even claims SpaceX bilked him out of wages he was owed by forcing him to work off the clock and rounding down his reported hours to 'fewer total hours than were actually worked.'

Structural technicians Bobby R. Lee and Bron Gatling have also filed suit. They were part of the layoffs in late July when between 200 and 400 employees were shown the door.

The plaintiffs say they weren't given a 60-day notice of the upcoming layoffs, which would break California's Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. The law stipulates that companies with over 75 employees must provide the notice when letting go 50 or more workers.

Companies found to be in violation of the law are required to pay 60 days compensation and could face civil penalties, notes the LA Times.

However, the former rocket techs' case--which they hope will become a civil suit covering all those who were laid off--spins largely upon whether or not the shedding of employees was a 'lay off.'

SpaceX has not qualified it as such. President Gwynne Shotwell instead characterized it as the termination of 'low performers.'

Lee and Gatling are asking for back pay, the value of unrecieved benefits and penalties.

Mr. Smith also hopes his case will become a class action and is asking for unpaid wages, wages from the rest periods he missed and penalties.
