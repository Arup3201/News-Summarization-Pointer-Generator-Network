Two footy fans have been injured at an NRL match in Penrith after the half-time entertainment went awry on Monday night.

During the clash between the Penrith Panthers and the Brisbane Broncos on Monday night supporters were playing a game called the 'Big Ball Bash' at Sportingbet Stadium, the Panthers' home ground.

The game sees teams of two charge towards an enormous inflatable ball with the aim to get it to the opposite end of the field and over their opposition's goal line.

Two fans were left battered and broken after a clash during the NRL's half-time entertainment on Monday night

The pair were left in a crumpled heap after running full-speed at the inflatable ball and instead colliding with each other

However two men were injured just seconds into the entertainment as they both sprinted towards the ball, which popped up in between them and put them on a collision course for the type of big hit typically seen on the field during play.

Footage shows one take the legs out from underneath his opposing fan and the pair land in a crumpled heap on the ground.

One of the men is said to have broken his ankle, while the other was left with a dislocated shoulder after the accident.

The fan with the ankle injury had to be carried off the field in a stretcher, and both men were transported to a nearby hospital.

News.com.au reported the pair even travelled there in the same ambulance.

Panthers CEO Warren Wilson told the website anyone who participated in the half-time entertainment had signed waiver forms meaning the club was not held responsible for any injuries.
