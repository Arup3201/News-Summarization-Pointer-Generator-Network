A family whose five-day-old baby was killed by a deadly E.coli infection has demanded answers from the hospital where the outbreak occurred.

Hope Evans was one of two babies who died in Swansea from a strain of the chronic stomach bug.

She was born 'very premature' and contracted the infection while being cared for on a specialist ward.

The second baby died in the community, but doctors suspect the child’s mother had caught the infection at the hospital and passed it on at home.

Both cases are centred on Singleton Hospital in Swansea.

Hope died after contracting the ESBL 
E.coli strain, which is resistant to antibiotics and can cause serious 
problems for the ‘vulnerable’.

Her parents Jeanette and Neil are too upset to speak about their loss, but grandmother Valerie Evans, 66, said: 'They are very distraught - they don't know what is going on.

'We haven't been given any information as to the cause of Hope's death. We've only been told an inquiry is ongoing and they are investigating.

'We need to know the answers of what took Hope away from us.'

Mrs Evans said the family was 'unaware' of any link with the other baby and three adults who are also being treated for E.coli at the hospital.

Paul Roberts, chief executive of Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said: 'The purpose of the review will be to ensure we have taken all reasonable measures to identify the cause of the cross infection.

Deaths: Singleton Hospital in Swansea, South Wales, where baby Hope Evans died. A second baby died 'in the community' but health chiefs believe the cases are linked

'It will also ensure that the 
management of the infections in conjunction with Public Health Wales has
been effective, and that the arrangements put in place for the ongoing 
care of mothers and babies are safe and appropriate.

'This review is expected to commence 
after we have concluded our own investigation into the two cases of ESBL
E.coli cross infection.'

Dr Bruce Ferguson Medical Director of
ABM University Health Board: 'We can confirm there is no evidence of 
the infection spreading further, and reiterate that these appear to be 
isolated incidents which have been contained.

'Singleton's maternity unit is open as normal for full-term births.

'The temporary precautionary neonatal
unit restriction limiting routine admissions to babies over 36 weeks 
gestation is continuing, but this is under constant review and we 
anticipate lifting this restriction shortly.

NHS chiefs at the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg Health Board said they were aware of five cases of the infection over the past month.

It said two of the cases of ESBL 
E.coli – normally less serious than the food poisoning strain of E.coli -
are being investigated in the maternity and neonatal unit at Singleton.

Hope was born in the hospital on October 31 but never went home after contracting the illness. She died on November 4.

Health officials yesterday said a new mother on a maternity ward had contracted the infection but is not seriously ill. 

A hospital spokesman said: ‘ESBL 
E.coli is most often found in the gastrointestinal tract but may cause 
urinary tract infections.

‘It is resistant to commonly used antibiotics such as penicillin, but can be treated.’

Dr Bruce Ferguson, medical director, 
said: ‘Tests have confirmed that in one of these cases the ESBL E.coli 
infection was contracted in the hospital.

'Sadly, this was a very premature baby who, despite the best efforts of staff, later died.

‘The cause of death of this baby is 
currently being investigated by the coroner. Everyone involved with the 
unit and in the care of this baby deeply regret this tragic loss.’

Dr Ferguson added: ‘These appear to be
isolated incidents which have been contained, and there is no evidence 
of the infection spreading further.

‘Checks have been taken of patients, 
equipment and areas in the maternity-neonatal unit and no evidence of 
ESBL E.coli has been found. The unit has an excellent record for hand 
hygiene and general infection control adherence.’

Extra precautions have been taken at 
the hospital which include carrying out a ‘deep clean’ at the obstetric 
theatres and increasing cleaning in the neonatal and labour wards.

The doctor said: ‘As a precaution, we
have temporarily restricted the neonatal unit to admissions for babies 
of 36 weeks and over gestation.

'We would like to reassure expectant 
mothers due to give birth in Singleton Hospital that the maternity unit 
is open as usual for full-term births.’

According to the Health Protection 
Agency, there are between 2,000 and 2,500 cases of ESBL E.coli every 
year in England, most of which affect the elderly.

Any concerned mothers-to-be are advised to speak to their midwife first but a helpline has also been set up on 0774 761 5627.

What is E. coli?Escherichia coli is a type of bacterium found in the intestines of humans and other animals and forms part of the normal gut flora. However, some strains can cause serious food poisoning and infection. While most people are affected with short-term diarrhoea, E. coli bacteria can cause the bladder infection cystitis and more serious complications, such as haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS). This is a serious disorder of the digestive system, which produces toxic substances that can get into the blood stream and cause kidney disease.

Where do the E.coli bacteria come from?Most people carry harmless strains of E. coli in their intestine. Both these and the strains that cause diarrhoea come from contaminated food or water. It can also be passed from animals to people and person-to-person through hand to mouth.

What about ESBL?The latest E.coli outbreak involves the ESBL strain - a milder strain than E. coli 0157 which causes food poisoning. ESBL infects around 30,000 people in England and Wales each year and causes no harm in most. However, it can cause infections in vulnerable people such as babies and the elderly and is difficult to treat as it is resistant to antibiotics. Patients with the strain can develop urinary tract infections that in turn can develop into deadly septicaemia (blood poisoning). How do you stop E.coli it spreading?Good hygiene is very important in preventing person-to person spread and small children should be supervised with hand washing after using the toilet and before eating.It is always advisable to wash fruits and vegetables before you eat them. Peeling or cooking fruit and vegetables can also remove germs. Also be careful not to swallow water while swimming in lakes or ponds.
