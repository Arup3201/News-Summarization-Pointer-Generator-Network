A chef has created burgers that taste like human flesh using first hand accounts of cannibalism to get the flavour as close as possible.

James Thomlinson designed his burger using gory testimonials describing the taste of human flesh, mixing veal, chicken livers, bone marrow and pork to make the macabre meal.

The chef, working in partnership with fellow food creative Miss Cakehead, will be giving away the controversial cannibal burgers at a secret pop-up restaurant in east London to mark the forthcoming fifth series of hit TV show The Walking Dead.

Culinary cannibalism: A chef has created burgers that taste like human flesh using first hand accounts of cannibalism to get the flavour as close as possible

Inspiration: James Thomlinson designed his burger using gory testimonials describing the taste of human flesh

'My food is inspired by flavor combinations and fresh produce, so it was a little odd to be inspired by the words of cannibals instead,' Mr Thomlinson told website Horror Talk.

The burgers were inspired by the season four finale of FOX TV series The Walking Dead, in which lead character Rick Grimes, played by British actor Andrew Lincoln, discovered human remains which looked to have been eaten by zombies, or 'Walkers'.

Without having ever tasted human flesh, Mr Thomlinson, who runs culinary company London Mess, researched accounts of cannibalism - including by 1920s New York Times journalist William Seabrook who had persuaded a medical student to give him a chunk of flesh from a man who had died in an accident.

Ingredients: Mr Thomlinson mixed veal, chicken livers, bone marrow and pork to make the macabre meal

Sampling: One brave food tester takes a bite of Mr Thomlinson's controversial burger 

In his book, Jungle Ways, he said: 'It was like good, fully developed veal, not young, but not yet beef. It was very definitely like that, and it was not like any other meat I had ever tasted. 

'It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal.'

Another 'inspiration', infamous cannibal killer Issei Sagawa, a Japanese man who murdered a Dutch woman named Renée Hartevelt in 1981 had described human meat as being like tuna fish.

He said it had 'melted in my mouth like raw tuna at a sushi restaurant.' 

Mr Thomlinson will offer up free burgers next Tuesday afternoon at his secret pop-up Terminus Tavern, which aims to recreate the show's creepy Terminus location.

Fans will need to follow Mr Thomlinson on Twitter, and use the #terminustavern hashtag in order to find out the secret location.

Season Five of The Walking Dead starts on Monday, October 13.

Garnish: Cheese is added, perhaps to make the burgers a little more palatable to the squeamish
