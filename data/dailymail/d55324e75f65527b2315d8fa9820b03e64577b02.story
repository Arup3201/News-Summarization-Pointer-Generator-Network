It's not a moment  to be forgotten in a hurry, and  with GoPro cameras now able to capture virtually any activity - no matter the conditions - these surfers' dream waves have been forever immortalised.

Photographer Silvin Morgan took a series of beautiful close quarter shots with surfers Nick Glinkowski and Neil Dana off the coast of Huatulco in Mexico.

The stunning photographs show Neil Dana slicing through the barrel of a wave using a GoPro camera.

Neil should know a thing or two about what makes a  dramatic action shot because he is one of the top bosses at GoPro.

Silvin, who calls himself a wave connoisseur, said: 'The trip was to celebrate with my friend for his 40th birthday.

'Neil is the main one that got the shot inside the barrel, he is actually the number two employee at GoPro.'

All of the photos were shot with the GoPro Hero 3+  and were Silvin's first set using the GoPro system.

GoPro is a US company that makes high definition cameras able to deal with extreme adventure situations.

Compact, lightweight, waterproof, shockproof and wearable or mountable on vehicles, there's almost noting they can't handle. Images are usually captured with a wide angle lens and can be shot remotely too.

GoPros are able to capture stunning shots thanks to being compact, lightweight, waterproof and shockproof
