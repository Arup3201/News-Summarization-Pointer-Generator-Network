'Politicised': Former RSPCA chief Gavin Grant, pictured

Donations to the RSPCA have dropped by more than £7million after the charity was accused of betraying its traditional core support for contentious political issues.

The backlash follows a controversial period for the RSPCA, which has been pursuing campaigns against hunting, the badger cull  and the Grand National.

It has also been accused of bullying tactics in bringing prosecutions for animal cruelty.

And there has been a power vacuum at the top of the organisation since Gavin Grant, the chief executive who presided over the charity’s new direction, unexpectedly left  his post in February due to ill health. His deputy, John Grounds, left six weeks later.

Critics of the RSPCA’s decision to campaign on politicised issues say the drop in donations indicates  that it needs to refocus on traditional concerns.

Latest accounts show the charity is in financial crisis and losing support from the public and grassroots members.

Accounts posted  on the RSPCA website show a fall in cash from voluntary income, with receipts down from £112.4 million to £105.4 million. Cash from legacies was down £5.7 million, while individual gifts fell by £1.2 million.

At the same time, membership fees fell by £34,000, or six per cent, from £590,000 to £556,000.

The charity’s overall operating income also slumped by more than £11 million, from £132.8 million to £121.2 million. This was due to rising costs for fuel, veterinary fees and private boarding costs incurred where there was no room at its centres to care for animals.

In a statement last week, RSPCA council chairman Mike Tomlinson said the figures were ‘clearly unsustainable and show things cannot continue to carry on as they are’. 

He told staff the charity needed to save £4.5 million and jobs would be cut from the 1,568 workforce.

Although the new plans have not yet been finalised, the charity intends to focus on animal rescue work.

It is also planning new money-making ventures so it does not have to rely on individuals leaving donations in their wills.

How the Mail On Sunday reported the Heythrop Hunt case in 2012

But it is not yet  clear if the organisation intends to cut back on controversial prosecutions, such as its decision to bring a £326,000 private case against the Heythrop Hunt in Oxfordshire in December 2012.

Although the case was successful, the judge suggested the public might feel the cash spent ‘can be more usefully employed’.

Sir Barney White-Spunner, of the Countryside Alliance, said: ‘The RSPCA has undertaken high-profile, political campaigns on subjects such as hunting, the badger cull, live exports and horse-racing – campaigns we feel have done little to further animal welfare and should not be the priority of the RSPCA.  We hope it will reconsider how it spends donors’ money.’

An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘We have seen periods where we are cash-rich, and leaner times when people tighten their belts. But  we are prepared to make difficult decisions.’
