Prisoners in a new 'superjail' will have a choice of Christmas dinners costing taxpayers more than the food given to patients at nearby hospitals, it has emerged.

Inmates at the £150million HMP Grampian, in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, will be tucking into chicken Balmoral and chocolate gateau on Christmas Day at a cost of £2.47 per prisoner.

Patients in NHS Grampian hospitals have just 89p spent on them for a two-course meal on average - although it does rise to £2.17 on December 25.

The difference in price has already been branded 'bizarre' by campaigners.

Eben Wilson, of TaxpayerScotland, said: 'This bizarre revelation just shows us the level of control the state has on our money.

'Obviously, we would like to think that patients would be treated more favourably at Christmas than convicted criminals.

'It seems like it is the season of goodwill for some men and not others.'

Prisoners were given menu sheets covering four days - Christmas, Boxing Day, New Year's Day and January 2.

On December 25 they will have the choice of either chicken Balmoral or a mushroom, brie and hazelnut wellington for their main course.

Their brightly coloured menus feature pictures of Father Christmas, holly, sheep and bells with space at the top for the prisoner to write in their name, number and which wing they live in.

Inmates were also handed a wordsearch with movie titles to keep them occupied in their cells.

For their Boxing Day meal, they can choose between a burger, a pizza, lasagne or curry. The New Year's Day selection features either a steak pie or a nut roast slice.

The cost of hospital patients food on Christmas Day rises to £2.17 for the main meal of the day with patients offered the choice of four dishes, including turkey with trimmings.

In the evening, a cold buffet style tea is provided for patients at a food cost of approximately £1.79 each.

Peterhead councillor Alan Buchan, a vocal critic of the prison, said: 'Peterhead has six of ten of the most deprived areas of Aberdeenshire in it including the most deprived area.

'I have constituents who can't afford to switch on the heating never mind eat all this fancy food.

'Meanwhile, these prisoners get underfloor heating, football pitches, a gym and all the comforts of home.

'It's ridiculous that the poorest people are treated worse than criminals.'

However, a prison source has revealed that some prisoners are complaining that sex offenders and violent criminals are getting the same treats as them.

The source said: 'Lots of these guys inside are happy being locked up because they get three square meals a day and usually a better telly than at home.

'They know they have it better than if they were on the dole outside - they read the papers and know about the poverty in the UK.

The latest revelation about life inside Scotland's newest prison comes just days after it was revealed that nearly 300 complaints had been made by inmates since it opened in March

'They wouldn't get chicken Balmoral on Christmas day if they were just getting benefits.'

But Margaret Mitchell MSP, Tory justice spokesperson, defended the costs as 'reasonable'.

She said: 'There could be many mitigating factors simply by the fact that ill people can't eat as much as those who are well.

'Prison has to be as much about rehabilitation as punishment and giving the prisoners the odd special day is a key part to reintegrating them into society.'

A spokeswoman from the Scottish Prison Service said: 'All offenders are offered the same choices, these can vary depending on the establishment.

'The average cost per adult prisoner per day which is £2.47 per day - young offenders get slightly more at £2.75.'

The latest revelation about life inside Scotland's newest prison comes just days after it was revealed that nearly 300 complaints had been made by inmates since it opened in March.

Inmates have lodged complaints about food, laundry and even the gym facilities.

The figures, released through Freedom of Information legislation, revealed how 292 complaints have been filed - an average of more than one a day.
