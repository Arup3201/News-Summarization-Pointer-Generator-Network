Marcello Casella, 54, appeared in Griffith Local Court on Wednesday over his alleged involvement in a drug syndicate

One of the brothers behind Australia's biggest family-owned winery has been charged over his alleged involvement in a $15 million drug ring.

Marcello Casella, 54, appeared in Griffith Local Court on Wednesday over his alleged involvement in the syndicate which police say produced, distributed and sold commercial quantities of cannabis and methylamphetamine.

Mr Casella, who helped build the internationally successful Yellow Tail label, was charged with one count of cultivating a large commercial quantity of a prohibited plant and one count of participating in a criminal group, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

On February 12, police raided a property connected to Mr Casella in Griffith, southwestern New South Wales, and a dozen other properties in an investigation into the alleged major drug supply syndicate, carried out by Strike Force Oceanic.

No drugs were found but police charged the 54-year-old, who is a champion clay shooter, over the improper storage of two pallets filled with shotgun cartridges and 60kg of gunpowder on the property.

The NSW Drug Squad arrested 12 other people and seized almost $15 million worth of illicit drugs, ammunition, and weapons.

The raids were carried out all over NSW and the ACT, including in Sans Souci and Miranda in south Sydney, Palmerston near Canberra, and Malua Bay and Batemans Bay on the NSW south coast.

Two weeks after the raids, Mr Casella resigned as director of Casella Wines, the winery that produces Yellow Tail.

Yellow Tail makes up more than a quarter of Australian bottled table wine exports, and the label is one of the largest selling in the U.S.

On September 22, Mr Casella and another Griffith man were also arrested and charged as part of Strike Force Oceanic's investigation. 

Mr Casella will appear in court again on January 2015.

Casella Wines, which is based out of Yenda near Griffith, is run by Mr Casella's brothers John and Joe.

Yellow Tail makes up more than a quarter of Australian bottled table wine exports, and the label is one of the largest selling in the U.S.
