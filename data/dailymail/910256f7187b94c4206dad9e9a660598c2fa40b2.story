Photographs of British war hero Field Marshal Montgomery returning to the scene of his greatest victory 25 years later have emerged for sale.

The candid images show Montgomery as an old man setting foot at El Alamein in Egypt to mark the anniversary of the Allies' first major triumph against Germans in World War Two.

The famous British general, affectionately known as Monty, led an army of more than 200,000 in 1942 and emerged victorious.

The victory marked a major turning point of the war as it revived moral in the flagging troops.

In 1967 Montgomery, then aged 80, returned to the desert to visit the scene of the Battle of El Alamein and pay his respects to the thousands of men who died.

His trip was covered in a magazine article at the time and appeared in a book about the battle.

A selection of the photos of him taken by acclaimed war photographer Don McCullin have surfaced 46 years after the moving visit.

The
 images portray Montgomery as an elderly man meeting the top brass of 
the Egyptian Army while surrounded by a scrum of photographers.

He is also seen having to be helped into a Wessex helicopter.

The photos are part of an archive belonging to the late journalist Derek Jewell, organiser of the Alamein trip, which also includes a series of letters from the war general and a signed copy of his memoirs.

In the correspondence, Montgomery thanks Jewell for organising the trip, stating 'the way you carried out the preliminary reconnaissance, and then organised and controlled the actual visit, was beyond all praise'.

A personal note to Jewell in the front of Montgomery's memoirs said he was 'a chief of staff par excellence under such conditions' and is signed 'Montgomery of Alamein'.

The collection was passed down through Jewell's family following his death in 1985. It is expected to fetch £8,000 when it goes under the hammer at auction tomorrow.

John Black, of auctioneers Sworders of
 Essex, said: 'To mark the 25th anniversary of the Battle of Alamein, 
Derek Jewell organised for Field Marshal Montgomery to return to the 
site of the battle.

'It was 
no mean feat - by that point Monty was a frail old man. He was 
incredibly stubborn and he always liked to have his own way.

Battle: An explosion at El Alamein whiche ended in the victory of the British Eighth Army commanded by Montgomery over Rommel's Afrika Korps. It proved to be the turning point in the war in Africa

The Battle of El Alamein was widely hailed as one of the turning points in the Second World War.

More than 4,000 Allied servicemen lost their lives and almost 9,000 were wounded in the combat that saw General Sir Bernard Montgomery's troops defeat German general Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps.

Under the command of Montgomery, nearly 200,000 British, Australian, New Zealand, South African, British Indian, Free French and Greek forces defeated the Axis powers.

At the time of the battle, which began on October 23, 1942 and ended on November 4, the Allies were fighting to keep their vital supply lines open from the Mediterranean to the East.

Rommel had inflicted heavy defeats on Allied forces in Africa, forcing them back to the village of El Alamein, about 60 miles west of Alexandria.

Finally, on October 23 General Montgomery ordered a counter-attack with almost 900 guns levelled at the German positions to be discharged at once.

While previously the Suez Canal was threatened, and with it Allied access to the rich oilfields of the Middle East, now the Allies were able to press their advantage and eventually push the Germans and Italians out of Africa.

Recalling the importance of the Allied victory at the Battle of El Alamein, Sir Winston Churchill said: 'Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein we never had a defeat.'

The Battle of Stalingrad between the Germans and the Soviets in 1942-43, and the Battle of Midway between the US and Japan, are also regarded as key turning points in the war.

'But he and Jewell got on incredibly well and the trip to Alamein started a very dear friendship between them.

'War photographer Don McCullin was the photographer assigned to capture the visit on camera.

'The photos that came out of the trip are quiet poignant. After they returned, Monty wrote a lovely letter to Derek thanking him for organising the trip.

'This collection provides a moving snapshot of one of Britain's best loved war heroes.'

After El Alamein, Montgomery went on to help mastermind the D-Day invasion in Normandy in June 1944. He died in March 1976 in Alton, Hants, aged 88.
