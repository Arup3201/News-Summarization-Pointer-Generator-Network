Australians will each spend about $37 less this festive season than they did last year as they worry about job security.

A CommBank survey of 1,000 Australians found people will on average fork out $1339 this Christmas, mainly on gifts, vacations and on Boxing Day sales.

Compared to last year's survey, consumers will spend about $37 less per person, Commonwealth Bank economist Diana Mousina says.

'It is an indication consumers will spend less which means it could be a worse Christmas than what we saw last year,' she told AAP.

Sales are expected to be down this festive season as Australians are increasingly concerned about the cost of living, job security and the economy

'The consumer sentiment numbers continue to be pretty poor. The majority of consumers are pessimistic about their personal finances and the outlook of the economy, predominantly the major concern being unemployment.

'People are worried about losing their jobs.'

A total of almost $18 billion is expected to be spent on gifts, food and vacations this Christmas.

The majority of the festive budget will go on gifts (totalling $7.6 billion) followed by vacations ($4.6 billion), the survey shows.

Spending will differ among the states with the biggest spenders expected to be New South Wales where the average person is estimated to splash out $1339, mainly on gifts, vacations and Boxing Day sales.

Queenslanders on the other hand, are the thriftiest.

They are expected to fork out an average of $779, largely because they spend much less on vacations, eating and drinking out and on entertaining family and friends than those in the other states.

The vast majority of Aussies (72 per cent) will purchase gifts from stores, while 28 per cent will shop online.

Shopping website eBay have predicted the top 10 bestselling toys this Christmas.

Disney's Frozen-themed collectables unsurprisingly are the most in demand. 

Frozen - the 2013 Disney film which is famous for its chart hit Let It Go - is the highest-grossing animated movie of all time with global ticket sales of $1.3 billion. 

A new PayPal study, conducted by Galaxy Research, reveals that Australians will spend an average of 46 hours - almost two whole days - prepping for Christmas but only spends eight hours celebrating the actual day.

The research also shows the average Australian buys 11 Christmas presents for family and friends but one in five are looking to buy more than 20 presents this season.
