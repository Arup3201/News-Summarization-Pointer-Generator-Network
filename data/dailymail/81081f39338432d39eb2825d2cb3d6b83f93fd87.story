If recent rumours are to be believed, Apple is branching out into self-driving cars, search engines and now virtual reality. 

Another patent has been awarded to the Californian firm that details a head-mounted iPhone virtual display. 

It follows a similar patent awarded in December 2013, and a job listing posted in November advertising for an virtual reality engineer. 

The patent is called 'Head-mounted display apparatus for retaining a portable electronic device with display' and was filed in September 2008. Its description reads: 'The portable electronic may be physically coupled to the head-mounted device such that [it] can be worn on the user's head'

Virtual reality is here: The Samsung Gear VR use a Note 3 tablet inside a $200 headset to provide the screen - and looks a lot like Apple's patent

The patent is called 'Head-mounted display apparatus for retaining a portable electronic device with display' and was filed in September 2008.

Its description reads: 'The portable electronic may be physically coupled to the head-mounted device such that [it] can be worn on the user's head.

'Each device may be allowed to extend its features and/or services to the other device for the purpose of enhancing, increasing and/or eliminating redundant functions between the head-mounted device and the portable electronic device.'

Following the release of Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the firm  achieved a record high for app downloads.

According to Fiksu’s  App Store Competitive Index, downloads in October were up 42 per cent cpmpared to September.

This was up 39 per cent year-on-year. 

More than 7.8 million downloads, across the top 200 free iOS apps, were recorded last month. 

Images in the patent show a head-mounted headset into which an iPhone can be placed and used as a display. 

One image in particular shows the device being controlled by a remote. 

The patent doesn't use the words 'virtual reality', but the headset's similarity to Samsung's Gear VR headset and Google's Cardboard headset suggests that the device would be used in a similar way. 

Apple's patent predates these announcements and subsequently has the potential to cause patent disputes with these companies. 

Hints that Apple was looking to expand into virtual reality appeared in December when it was awarded a patent simply called 'Head-mounted display.'

The patent was filed in May 2007 and details a ‘goggle system for providing a personal media viewing experience to a user.’

Apple explained that the goggle system may resemble ski or motorcycle goggles, and to ‘enhance the user's comfort, the goggle system may include breathable components’, including breathable foam that rests against the user's face.

In November rumours surfaced again when the firm posted a job listing  for an engineer to create 'apps that integrate virtual reality systems.'

It said: ‘We are looking for a software engineer to develop UI and applications to create next generation software experiences.

If Apple is looking to expand into the virtual reality market, it would follow rivals Google, Samsung and Oculus Rift - despite filing its patent before these firms released their headsets. Google Cardboard (pictured) is made from cardboard folded to form an enclosure, in which a phone is then slotted in to act as a display

‘This engineer will create high performance apps that integrate with virtual reality systems for prototyping and user testing.’

The candidate will work with the team in the firm’s Santa Clara Valley office. 

It is not known whether the firm is looking to develop hardware, as well as software, but an Apple headset would rival the likes of Oculus Rift and Samsung's Gear VR.
