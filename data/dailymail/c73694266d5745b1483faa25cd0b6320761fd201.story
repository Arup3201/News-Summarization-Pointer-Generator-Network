Florida wildlife officials say 11 Burmese pythons have been killed during the first three days of a public hunt for the non-native species in the Everglades.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission says more than 1,000 people from more than 30 states have registered to compete in the month-long ‘Python Challenge.’

The pythons killed since the competition began Saturday will be processed by the University of Florida.

Officials say they hope the large number of hunters will help researchers gather more information about the snakes' habits.

As well as culling South Florida’s population of invasive Burmese pythons, the purpose of the hunt is also to raise awareness about non-native species and their detrimental effects on the local ecosystem.

It's unknown how many pythons live in the Everglades. Researchers say the large snakes menace native wildlife.

Florida law prohibits possession or sale of the pythons for use as pets.

Hunters are restricted to four state wildlife management areas; Everglades National Park is off-limits. They may use some firearms, as well as captive bolts and machetes to kill pythons. Native species may not be taken.

The state is offering cash prizes to 
whoever brings in the longest python and whoever bags the most pythons 
by the time the competition ends at midnight Feb. 10.

Dozens of would-be python 
hunters showed up for some last-minute training in snake handling 
Saturday morning at the University of Florida Fort Lauderdale Research 
and Education Center in Davie.

The training came down to common sense: Drink water, wear sunscreen, don't get bitten by anything and don't shoot anyone.

Many of the onlookers dressed in camouflage, though they probably didn't have to worry about spooking the snakes.

They would have a much harder time spotting the splotchy, tan pythons in the long green grasses and woody brush of the Everglades.

'It's advantage-snake,' mechanical engineer Dan Keenan concluded after slashing his way through a quarter-mile of scratchy sawgrass, dried leaves and woody overgrowth near a campsite in the Big Cypress National Preserve, which is about 50 miles southeast of Naples and is supervised by the National Park Service.

Keenan, of Merritt Island, and friend Steffani Burd of Melbourne, a statistician in computer security, holstered large knives and pistols on their hips, so they'd be ready for any python that crossed their path. The snakes can grow to more than 20 feet in length.

The most useful tool they had, though, was the key fob to their car. Burd wanted to know that they hadn't wandered too far into the wilderness, so Keenan clicked the fob until a reassuring beep from their car chirped softly through the brush.

The recommended method for killing pythons is the same for killing zombies: a gunshot to the brain, or decapitation to reduce the threat. (The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals doesn't approve of the latter method, though.)

Pythons are kind of the zombies of the Everglades, though their infestation is less deadly to humans. The snakes have no natural predators, they can eat anything in their way, they can reproduce in large numbers and they don't belong here.

Florida currently prohibits 
possession or sale of the pythons for use as pets, and federal law bans 
the importation and interstate sale of the species.

Wildlife
experts say pythons are just the tip of the invasive species iceberg. 
Florida is home to more exotic species of amphibians and reptiles than 
anywhere else in the world, said John Hayes, dean of research for the 
University of Florida's Institute for Food and Agricultural Sciences.

Roughly 2,050 pythons have been harvested in Florida since 2000, according to the conservation commission. It's unknown exactly how many are slithering through the wetlands.

Officials hope the competition will help rid the Everglades of the invaders while raising awareness about the risks that exotic species pose to Florida's native wildlife.

Keenan and Burd emerged from the Everglades empty-handed Saturday, but they planned to return Sunday, hoping for cooler temperatures that would drive heat-seeking snakes into sunny patches along roads and levees.

Burd still deemed the hunt a success. 'For me, I take back to my friends and community that there is a beautiful environment out here.

It's opening the picture from just the python issue to the issue of how do we protect our environment,' she said.
