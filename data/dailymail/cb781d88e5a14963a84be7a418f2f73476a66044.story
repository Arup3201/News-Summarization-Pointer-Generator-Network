Zinedine Zidane joined a number of other French coaches on a trip to Germany to watch Bayern Munich train in order to pick up some tips.

World Cup winner Zidane was among seven French coaches to have taken advantage of the international break in order to head to the German champions for a three-day visit.

The group comprised Zidane, assistant coach of Real Madrid's B team, Bordeaux boss Willy Sagnol, former Chelsea favourite Claude Makelele, Guy Lacombe, Bernard Diomede, Claude Le Roy and Franck Thivillier.

Sagnol played for Bayern from 2000 to 2009 but Zidane, a triple World Player of the Year and 1998 World Cup winner, is the highest-profile of the visitors.

The seven met chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge on Monday and  monitored training under Spaniard Pep Guardiola on Tuesday and Wednesday, Bayern said.

In an interview for Bayern's official You Tube channel, Zidane said: 'It's an incredibly organised club with people like Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Matthias Sammer, who used to play football and really live and breathe the game

Then you combine that with someone like Pep Guardiola and the players that are full of desire and have a very precise footballing philosophy.'

'Bayern are a big club, one of the top five in the world, but there's also a family atmosphere. I'm mightily impressed.'

The Bavarians are enjoying one of the most successful spells in their 115-year history, having won the Champions League once and reached the final twice more in the past five seasons.

They are also on track for a repeat of the 2013 treble, 10 points clear in the Bundesliga and still in contention for German Cup and Champions League glory.

Bayern are also flush with cash. Turnover in the last fiscal year was in excess of £366million and they have also paid off their Allianz Arena home ahead of time.
