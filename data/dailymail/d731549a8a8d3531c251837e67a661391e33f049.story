Arrested: Fugitive Kazakh oligarch Mukhtar 
Ablyazov, who was held in France after special forces backed by armoured vehicles 
swooped on his rented home

French police special forces called in airpower and armoured vehicles for an operation to seize a wealthy fugitive Kazakh oligarch wanted in three countries over a $5billion bank fraud.

Mukhtar Ablyazov was held after paramilitary police swooped on a rental home in the town of Mouans Sartoux, near Nice in south-east France, said Solange Legras, chief prosecutor at an appeals court in Aix-en-Provence.

The police used 'powerful means'  - 
including armoured vehicles and a plane - because Ablyazov was known to 
have a 'private militia' at his disposal, said Ms Legras, whose office 
focuses on international cases.

In the event, no shots were fired during the operation.

The 50-year-old is wanted in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan over a string of allegations of fraud and organised crime.

He disappeared from the UK in February 2012 just before a British court sentenced him to 22-months in jail for contempt of court in a financial fraud trial.

He was subsequently stripped of assets worth more than £150million in British assets, including an £18million mansion in one of London's most exclusive streets.

Ablyazov, who has been wanted by Interpol since 2009, was held on allegations of 'large-scale fraud in an organised group', Ms Legras said by phone, shortly after meeting with Ablyazov to explain the possible extradition process. 

A former energy minister in his home country, Ablyazov later emerged as a prominent opponent of Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the energy-rich Central Asian nation since before the Soviet collapse.

Shortly after setting up a pro-reform party in 2001, Ablyazov was sentenced to six years in prison for abuse of public office. However, he was pardoned by Mr Nazarbayev and released in 2003, vowing to stay out of politics - a promise he broke by funnelling money to the opposition.

Kazakhstan's prosecutors have 
described Ablyazov as the head of an extremist, criminal conspiracy bent
 on 'seizing power by inciting civil strife and hatred.' He is wanted 
there on charges of siphoning off at least $5billion from BTA Bank, 
which based in the central Asian country's business capital, Almaty.

The
 prosecutor in Astana, the Kazakh capital, said Interpol had informed 
the government of Ablyazov's arrest, which was carried out at the 
request of Ukraine, where he is wanted on charges of alleged 
embezzlement of funds from a local branch of the BTA bank. He is also 
sought by Russia in connection with embezzlement charges involving BTA 
bank and a Russian company.

There was no extradition request from the UK, where Ablyazov was in February 2012 convicted of contempt of court after attempting to hide the extent of his wealth from a legal action taken by the now state-owned BTA bank in the hope of recovering some of the allegedly embezzled funds.

Mr Justice Teare, sitting in the High Court, said Ablyazov was accused of 'fraud on an epic scale' and had committed 'deliberate and substantial' contempts by breaching an asset-freezing order imposed to stop money vanishing before litigation concluded.

The conviction was upheld at the Court of Appeal last November, where senior judge Lord Justice Maurice Kay said Ablyazov had shown 'rare cynicism and deviousness' as he fought the claims against him and ordered him stripped of assets worth more than £150million.

Mr Ablyazov’s property portfolio in Britain is alone worth more than £63million. His Bishops Avenue property — Carlton House — is worth £17million and is in a street nicknamed Billionaires' Row.

The mansion has a 50ft ballroom and a Turkish bath, and is one of several he bought in a spree financed allegedly using fake loans, backdated documents and offshore accounts.

He also has a £1m apartment in Albert Court, closet to Lord's cricket ground; and Oaklands Park - a 100-acre estate on the edge of Windsor Great Park with tennis courts and helicopter pad.

In a statement on his Facebook page, 
Madiyar Ablyazov, the former banker's son, said he feared what would 
happen if his father were deported to Kazakhstan.

'We
 beg the French authorities not to grant Kazakhstan our father. He is a 
man of honour, who has been fighting all his life, and sacrificed so 
much, for freedom and democracy in Kazakhstan,' the younger Ablyazov 
wrote. 'We are afraid for his life.'

Ablyazov's arrest came after the deportation of his wife and young daughter from Italy to Kazakhstan caused a political crisis in Rome last month. Because France has no extradition agreement with Kazakhstan, Ms Legras, the Aix-en-Provence prosecutor, said she is focusing on the extradition request from Ukraine for now.

Under the extradition process, the requesting country has 40 days to send its legal dossier to French authorities. Once that is received, French prosecutors will have five days to present Ablyazov to investigating magistrates. 'In my opinion, this isn't going to happen before the autumn,' she said.

The managing director of BTA Bank today told MailOnline the company welcomed Ablyazov's arrest. Pavel Prosyankin said: 'This arrest is a result of the Bank’s diligent efforts through the British justice system to recover the billions of dollars he stole while Chairman.

'We have sought his arrest to prevent him from further dissipating assets which the English High Court ordered to be put in receivership.

'He has flouted many court orders and fled the UK after we secured another High Court judgment sentencing him to prison in England.

'He is now in custody and we are optimistic that we will be better positioned to recover more of the assets which the court has authorised us to seize.'

Ablyazov denies wrongdoing and says the allegations are politically motivated.
