A spelling mishap on a North Carolina interstate might make workers think twice about finishing a renovation 13 hours before it's due and botching it in the process.

Travelers on Interstate-77 in Cornelius, North Carolina traveling southbound off ramp towards exit 28 were surprised to see the word 'noly' instead of 'only' which is what the right turn lane is supposed to read.

The product of what may have been rushed work during an over-the-weekend construction project is leaving drivers both amused and confused.

Interstate 77 in North Carolina has the word 'noly' written on it instead 'only'

The popular Interstate road read 'noly' in white permanent paint next to the correctly spelled word, 'only' on the left.

WBTV spoke with Cornelius Project manager Tyler Beardsley who blamed the misspelling on the project being completed before its due date.

'I think the contractor was just in a rush to get the bridge open as fast as possible and got a little careless,' said Beardsley to the TV station.

The job was meant to take 32 hours but took 18 hours instead, almost half of the time it was supposed to take.

Crews were meant to fix the road Monday night at no cost to tax payers.

The Mail Online contacted the Cornelius traffic department but no one was available for comment.
