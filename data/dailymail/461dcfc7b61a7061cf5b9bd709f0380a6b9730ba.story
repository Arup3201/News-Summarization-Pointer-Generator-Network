As 10-foot-high waves crashed onto Blackpool's shores this morning, the first frost of the season began creeping into Britain - but there is sun and heat around the corner.

A chill has fallen over the Midlands, Wales and the North of England as temperatures drop to single figures.

With some parts of Wales as low as 1.6C, the UK is well below the 16.8C average for this time of year.

It follows a weekend of gale-force winds and sporadic showers that seemed to eclipse summer in one fell swoop.

Last gust of wind: Blackpool's North Shore is battered by gales and rain that sent waves crashing four metres in the air and onto the shore. This weather is easing off

Whopper swans have started arriving at a wildlife reserve in East Anglia a week earlier than usual, forecasting Britain will have a freezing winter. Two of the swans arrived at the Ouse Washes in Welney, Cambridgeshire, on Friday, but are normally seen at the end of September. Tonight sees the first frost of the season

Blackpool has been blasted with wind soaring in from the West and this morning waves jumped three-four metres in the air as they clapped onto the shore.

But tomorrow will see a change as the sunrise brings temperatures inching into the high teens.

In the south east, people will enjoy temperatures as high as 24C.

The ever-changing weather is welcomed by the owners of a Welsh tea room, famous for its coat of blazing red ivy.

Virginia Creeper leaves burst into life when the intermittent rain and sun comes in September, covering Tu Hwnt I'r Bont tea room in Conwy, Wales.

It attracts attention from all over the globe - earning the medieval building its nickname 'the red house'.

The early autumn has been welcomed in small a part of North Wales where a small Welsh tearoom is awash with vivid red hues as a Virginia Creeper cloaks the Tu Hwant l'r Bont tearoom

The tea room owner, Tim Maddox, observes the wonderful array of autumn colours pouring over the unique cottage. The small stone building built in 1480 on the banks of the River Conwy is steeped in history and was originally used as a courthouse in the 15th century

The Red House: The tea room in Wales attracts visitors from all over for a glimpse at its multi-coloured coat. It is an autumn highlight and spends the rest of the year as bare stone

Paradise: Tim Maddox says his building is a paradise on the north coast of Wales. Tu Hwant I'r Bont is Welsh for 'beyond the bridge' as the building was built before the Inigo Jones Bridge

The charming cottage, which has operated as a tea room since the 1930s, lies in an idyllic setting alongside an historic Inigo Jones bridge.

Tim Maddox, 47, who runs the tea room with his wife Ayla, said: 'We have run the tea rooms for 11 years and it is a fantastic little corner of the world here.

'The whole area is alive and bursting with colour, the setting is really special.

'We get lots of people coming to see the red leaves, it is unbelievable how bright they are. The colours are just superb.

'The leaves start to change colour around August bank holiday and by the end of September the cottage is completely red.

Ideal conditions: The Met Office says this is typical sporadic weather for September but the extreme low last weekend and heat this week bode well for crops and shrubs

Delighted gardeners the Derbyshire Peak district also celebrated the spring of Virginia Creeper after a weekend of rain and the imminent spell of sun. All this year's new growth is pruned to protect the church's stonework and to stop it disappearing altogether

Blooming: Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh is clothed in Gorse in bloom as the rain eases of, allowing it to flourish in the mildly warmer temperatures

Rain easing off: The final showers of the day in Manchester are coming to a close, left, and London is dry and bright today compared to the storms yesterday, right

'When people see the leaves they can't believe this place and they have to come and have a look.

'We have had people travelling to London who have taken a detour here, it has become something of a famous sight.'

With a spell of sun around the corner, the VIrginia Creeper will have a window of time to flourish.

North Scotland, however, will remain stormy until the Atlantic wave of wind and rain moves on towards the end of the week.

The nights ahead are set to be a dramatic improvement on the harsh conditions of last Saturday and Sunday.

Oakhampton in Devon dropped to 3C, Hurn in Dorset hit 2.2C, and Bala in Wales barely made it above 1C on Sunday.

Today, the average temperature is 11C, and there is a frosty evening ahead, averaging at 6C in the south east, and even lower in the north.

Winds have already started scaling over the Bristol Channel and the Midlands, and look set to persist through the night.

The next few days will be warmer but rain is typically sporadic for this time of year. Tomorrow it is clear with high temperatures, Thursday is rainy but warm

But by morning it will shift, making way for sun and blue skies on Wednesday.

The evenings to come will also be warm and clear throughout the UK.

Thursday will get drier throughout the day, according to the Met Office, and any drizzles of rain in Northern Ireland, Wales and England will die out early on - but heavy showers could linger in Scotland.

Met Office forecaster Lindsay Myers today told MailOnline: 'At the moment temperatures are considerably lower than average.

'It is clearing up the weather from last weekend.

'But the next few days are certainly dry, warm, and clear in most places.

'This change in conditions often happens at this time of year. It gets very cold then very warm, then it changes again.'
