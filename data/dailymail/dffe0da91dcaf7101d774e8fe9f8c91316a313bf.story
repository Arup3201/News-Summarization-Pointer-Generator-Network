Jamie Theakston has reduced the sale price of his £2million Tudor mansion after failing to attract buyers.

Wings Place in Ditchling, East Sussex, is now being listed at £1.85million after sitting idly on the market for almost a year. 

The five-bedroom property lies in grounds once owned by Henry VIII who is thought to have given the estate to his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves following the annulment of their marriage. 

Wings Place in Ditchling, East Sussex, has been on the market for almost a year. The property is now being sold for £1.85million after failing to attract buyers 

Mr Theakston has spoken in the past of how buying the property in 2004 was a 'boyhood dream'. 

But with most of his time spent in London, the 44-year-old radio DJ decided to put it up for sale in May last year. 

The house's sprawling grounds were the setting of Mr Theakston's wedding to jeweller Sophie Siegle in 2007. 

The couple, who have two children, also own a house in Chiswick, west London. 

Wings Place has four reception rooms, five bedrooms, three bathrooms and a cellar.The grade 1 listed house also has an impressive external staircase leading to what was once a public library.  

The property is Grade I listed and once belonged to Henry VII. Mr Theakston is selling it after spending too much time away, he said

After being listed for £2million, the house remains for sale at a lower price. It has four reception rooms and five bedrooms

Among its traditional features are original 16th Century fireplaces and wooden beans. Above, one of four reception rooms at Wings Place

It was one of several manor houses given to Anne of Cleves by Henry VII following the annulment of their marriage in 1540. 

Mr Theakston and his wife Sopgie Siegle also have a home in Chiswick, West London

In the 1950s it was listed as a Grade 1 heritage site, with its staircases, fireplaces and wall paintings in tact. 

Speaking when the house was first put up for sale, Mr Theakston said: 'The bottom line is that we just don’t have time to use it that much any more. 

'You never really own this kind of house, you just look after it for the next generation.’

Wings Place is set in grounds formerly known as Ditchling  Manor Garden, first mentioned in texts dating back to the 11th Century. 

Following the dissolution of monasteries in 1537, it was gifted to Henry VIII who later gave it to his lieutenant. 

Three years later the king gave the house to Anne of Cleves following the annulment of their marriage. 

After her death it was reverted to the Crown and later occupied by Lord Abergavenny who gave it Henry Poole as part of a dowry for the hand of his daughter in the 1570s.

Later, part of the house was converted into a public library by James Browne, whose father took ownership of it in 1688. 

The library was accessed by an external stair case which is still in tact.

In the mid 1800s, several families were listed as living at Wings Place. It was sold at auction in 1935 and has remained in private ownership since.  

The house's grounds were the setting for Mr Theakston's wedding reception in 2007. He and jeweller Sophie Siegle married in the nearby village church 

The house is being sold by estate agents Savills. Previously Mr Theakston said it had been a 'boyhood dream' to live in it
