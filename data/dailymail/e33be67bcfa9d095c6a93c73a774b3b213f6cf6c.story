This zoo primate looks like he is deep in thought after striking a pose just like Bruce Forsyth in his glory days on The Generation Game.

The mandrill was seen bent over with its head on its fist and looking similar to the veteran BBC presenter.

Jason Mendoza took the photo of the photogenic ape at Singapore Zoo.

He said: 'He was sat in that position for quite some time. 

'He looks like he was posing but he was actually scratching his different parts of his head.

'It was a piece of luck to get the photo. I waited for him to scratch his upper nose between his two eyes that look like he is thinking. Maybe he was thinking about escaping.

The versatile animal has also prompted comparisons with a classic sculpture after his resemblance to The Thinker by French artist August Rodin was noticed. 

The Thinker was originally part of the compositional piece Rodin created for the proposed Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris.

Classic artwork: The pensive primate also resembles The Thinker, a famous statue by Auguste Rodin

The piece, known as The Gates of Hell, is based on the 16th century epic poem, The Divine Comedy by Dante. 

Many of Rodin's most famous works came out of this piece and The Thinker was originally intended to sit at the top of the door way and represent Dante, as he composed the poem.

For this reason The Thinker was originally known as The Poet but as this piece began to gain precedence over The Gates of Hell, it became known as The Thinker and is today a commonly recognised symbol of philosophy and learning.
