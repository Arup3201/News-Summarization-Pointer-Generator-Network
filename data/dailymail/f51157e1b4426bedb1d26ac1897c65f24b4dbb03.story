Ian Wright outside his home in north west London which was raided by knife-wielding robbers

Ian Wright has spoken of the 'terrifying' moment an armed gang held a Stanley knife to his wife's throat and threatened to cut off her fingers before they fled with family possessions including the former Arsenal and England star's MBE.

The 50-year-old pundit had to cut short his work for ITV at the World Cup in Brazil to look after wife Nancy, 39, and their daughters, aged four and two, following the raid on Wednesday night.

Wright went straight to a waiting car which whisked him back to his family after his 11-hour flight from Rio de Janeiro landed at London's Heathrow airport on Thursday lunchtime.

After rushing into his home in Queen's Park, north-west London, he later emerged to confirm that everyone was safe and his wife was 'feeling good that I'm back'.

Speaking to The Sun, he said the men who were wearing masks barged in after Nancy opened the door at 9.15pm.

'They threatened to cut her fingers off and even threatened to do the same to the children, who were both upstairs in their bedrooms.

'Nancy was praying the children wouldn't wake up.

'It would have been devastating for them to see what was happening.'

According to Wright, the men were hysterically shouting at Nancy to show them where the family safe was and marched her from room to room.

When the safe was found, Nancy pleaded with the men to stop and said she would open it if they stopped pushing her around.

Wright confirmed the MBE he was given by the Queen in 2000 for services to football was taken alongside rare watches.

One of the watches was given to him by former Arsenal team-mate Dennis Bergkamp while the other was an Arsenal watch with an inscription from the club.

However, Wright said the main thing was that his family was safe.

Back in Britain: Ian Wright landed at London's Heathrow yesterday to support his family after the terrifying raid on their home on Wednesday. He tweeted 'You won't get away with it' before boarding the plane

The star sent a message to the gang on Twitter before boarding the flight posting: 'You won't get away with it'

In a short statement outside his home, he said: 'All I want to say 
really is me and my missus, my girls, everyone's safe. The police are 
trying to get on with what they are doing.'

It is understood four men armed with 
knives stormed their way into his home in Queen's Park, north-west 
London shortly after 9pm before making off with personal possessions.

Police believe the family could have been followed home from a nearby park. 

The suspects are described as black, aged
 between 18 and 25, with London accents, wearing dark clothing and 
hoodies obscuring their faces, he added. No arrests have been made.

Wright added: 'What's really disappointing is they're from an age group I've worked with and tried to help.'

A
 spokesman for Wright said today that he was left 'really upset and angry' 
after learning of the horrific incident/

He
 said: 'We are very grateful to ITV for being so supportive and getting him back so quickly. Nancy
 is really shaken up.

Their kids are so young that hopefully they aren't
 going to read into it too much. They are all physically OK - Nancy and 
the kids.

'Ian is just really upset and angry and just wants to come back and be with his family at this time.'

Asked
 if they had received any update on whether police have tracked down the
 raiders, he added: 'Nancy may have, but we haven't heard anything 
further from the police at this time.'

The spokesman said Wright hoped other footballers and pundits over in Brazil covering
 the tournament would not also become a target for robbers.

He said: 'Hopefully, with enough media coverage, this won't happen to any 
other players or people who are over in the World Cup. Ian is trying to 
get the message out.'

An ITV spokesman said: 'Ian travelled 
home immediately to be with his family on hearing the shocking news. Our
 thoughts and best wishes are with them.'

Wright's neighbours expressed their shock at the robbery today and described him as a 'lovely family man'.

Next-door neighbour Marianne Collinge, 70, said: 'I suppose they could be a bit of a target because they do have beautiful cars.

'But they are very unpretentious people. They are one of us and I'm terribly sorry for them, it's awful.'

Chris
 Martin, a neighbour in his 50s, said: 'We were watching the Spain game 
when the police arrived last night and that's all we know about it.

'Ian
 is a neighbour and a decent family man. He's been living here several 
years and everyone around here respects his privacy.'

Well-wishers today took flowers to Wright's door and posted messages through his letterbox, while police made door-to-door inquiries.

Scotland Yard said it was investigating an aggravated burglary at an address in north-west London after they were called at 9.20pm last night.

Four men, believed to be armed with knives, forced their way inside the house and stole a number of items, including personal property and jewellery, a police spokesman said.

Detective Chief Inspector Mick Gornall, who is leading the investigation, said: 'We are trying to trace these four men, and I'd ask anyone who may know anything to get in touch with my team and help us.

'Fortunately no one was injured during the burglary, but it is still very frightening to have people force their way into your home and threaten you.

'Last night officers went to the address and started carrying out house-to-house inquiries. We are also seizing and reviewing CCTV.'

Gary Lineker, who is fronting coverage of the World Cup for the BBC, offered Wright his support this afternoon

Athlete Denise Lewis was among a number of Wright's famous friends who tweeted their support

Christian O'Connell, who works with Wright at Absolute Radio, branded the gang 'cowards' on the website
