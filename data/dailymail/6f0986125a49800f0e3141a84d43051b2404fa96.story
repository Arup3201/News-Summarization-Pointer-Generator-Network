A new Japanese robot promises to keep your carpets clean and tidy - while also chatting about its day and sending you pictures as it carries out its chores.

Cocorobo speaks three languages, including English, and comes with more than 30 phrases to keep you updated.

And - proving that there really is an app for everything - Cocorobo comes with an iPhone app to allow you to directly interact with your robot friend, from controlling its movements, to live-streaming the view from the carpet.

It will even send you pictures as it trundles around the home - and, naturally, it will be cleaning up as it goes along.

Cocorobo, the talking robot cleaner, will send you pictures of your home as it trundles around the place

There's an app for that: Take an instant shot of the world via carpet-cam with the Cocorobo

App close and personal: The iPhone app shows Cocorobo's activities, such as how far he has travelled, how long he has been cleaning, and how charged he is

The robotic circular cleaner, created 
by manufacturing giant Sharp, is the latest twist to the automatic 
vacuum cleaner. It follows on from iRobot's Roomba, a very popular 
cleaner which is available in the UK.

Cocorobo says 36 phrases, including 'Long time no see' and 'Hello', in Japanese, English and Chinese.

It also speaks the Kansai dialect of 
southwestern Japan, which is widely viewed as more comical and witty 
than standard Japanese.

You can ask it questions, such as 'How's it going?', and get back answers such as 'I'm cool and feeling good'.

'Dear owner, I'm scared of the dog': If Cocorobo sees something interesting, it can take a picture and send it direct to your phone

The 'Cocorobo', sold by Japanese electronics maker Sharp, can speak 36 phrases in three languages

The cleaner sells for around £990 - an
expensive toy compared to something like the Henry Hoover, which 
retails for around £100, but Sharp is gambling the personality and 
unique video-streaming gives this enough value to robot enthusiasts who 
value their cleanliness.

The robot comes with infra-red sensors
to ensure it does not bump into things around your house, and also 
purifities the room as it goes.

When it's tired, it can walk itself 
into a little docking station and sleep, waiting for its owner to wake 
it up with a friendly greeting.

Home to bed: When the robo-cleaner has finished his duties, he can retire to his docking bay to recharge, and chat about his day
