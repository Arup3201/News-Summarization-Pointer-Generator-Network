The Department of Homeland Security flatly denied on Wednesday a claim from a California Congressman that the ISIS terror army is quietly slipping into the United States through its porous southern border – and that American border patrol agents have already captured ten of its soldiers.

Republican Duncan Hunter told a Fox News Channel audience on Tuesday that ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, is actively infiltrating the U.S.

'I know that at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,' he said. 'There's nobody talking about it.'

But DHS fired back, saying in a statement that Hunter's claim is 'categorically false.'

Rep. Duncan Hunter stunned a Fox News audience by saying that the US has apprehended about ten ISIS terrorists as they entered the country through the Mexican border

Vulnerable: Much of the Texas-Mexico border is essentially undefended, with US Border Patrol agents setting up well on the American side

'The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,' a Homeland Security spokesman said in a statement, using the administration's preferred alternative acronym for the group.

'DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.'

CBS News reported Wednesday that one of Hunter's sources 'nuanced their claims' after the Fox broadcast, saying that some of the people he referred to may have been 'ISIS-affiliated or possibly Americans who fought with the Syrian Free Army.'

The FSA is an ISIS foe, not an ally.

Hunter's spokesman pushed back, defending his claim.

“The congressman was conveying what he knows – and what he was told,' the spokesperson said in a statement. 

'It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing – it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.' 

Hunter, like many in the GOP, has advocated in the past for strengthening America's border security to the south, a demand that has largely fallen on deaf ears during the Obama presidency.

During a 2013 Senate hearing, then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said that due to the administration's 'significant progress and efforts ... our borders have, in fact, never been stronger.'

But Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, claimed Tuesday that the nation's 1,933-mile southern border represents ISIS's best hope of waging war on the U.S.

'If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border,' he said. 'It's that simple.'

'ISIS doesn't have a navy, they don't have an air force, they don't have nuclear weapons. The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming in through the southern border – which they already have.' 

'You're talking about OUR southern border?' Fox host Greta can Susteren was shocked to hear Hunter's claim that ISIS is infiltrating the US

Host Greta Van Susteren was caught flat-footed. 'Are you talking about ours?' she asked. 'You're talking about our southern border? You're not talking about the southern border of Iraq?'  

'They aren't flying B-1 bombers, bombing American cities,' he replied, 'but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.'

The three-term congressman cited a similar fear that Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey expressed during an August 21 Pentagon press briefing.

Dempsey called ISIS 'an immediate threat ... because of open borders and immigration issues.'

Hunter said his information came directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has a 20,000-strong army of agents patrolling the borders in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California. 

'I've asked the border patrol,' he said, adding that he was told about the ten ISIS fighters who were caught crossing the border. 

'If they catch five or ten of them, then you know there's gonna be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,' he said. 'But that's how you know: All you have to do is ask the border patrol.' 

The government watchdog group Judicial Watch claimed in August that ISIS terrorists were 'planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.' 

The group said a 'warning bulletin for an imminent terrorist attack' had been issued to 'agents across a number of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense agencies,'instructing them 'to aggressively work all possible leads and sources' to prevent the attacks.

The Department of Homeland Security flatly denied that in a statement to MailOnline.

'We are aware of absolutely nothing credible to substantiate this claim,' a bewildered DHS spokesman said 

'In Mexico? I haven't seen that at all.'

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on the same day Judicial Watch made its claims that his agency and the FBI were 'unaware of any specific, credible threat to the U.S. homeland' from the terror network.
