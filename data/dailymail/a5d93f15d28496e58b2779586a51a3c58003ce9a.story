Sir Alex Ferguson was no stranger to splashing the cash during his 26 years in the Old Trafford hotseat and so the Scot is well-placed to assess Manchester United's summer signings.

The former Red Devils manager sat down with sports presenter Jim Rosenthal for an exclusive interview on MUTV about his life after retiring in 2013.

Casting an eye over the £150million worth of talent acquired by Louis van Gaal, here Ferguson assesses each of United's new boys.

Ferguson discussed  United's summer signings and gave his view on Radamel Falcao and Angel Di Maria

ANGEL DI MARIA 

Former club: Real Madrid

Fee: £60million

Man United appearances: 5

Man United goals: 3

Ferguson admitted Manchester United needed to spend in order to reinforce the squad this summer.

The Red Devils broke the British transfer record to land Real Madrid wideman Di Maria in a massive £60million deal and Ferguson believes big fees are part and parcel of modern day football.

'That's the way the game is going today with fees like £86m for Gareth Bale,' said Ferguson.

'I think when you can identify ability like that needed by Manchester United, they have the resources to do that. They are fees I never quite equalled but nonetheless they were needing quite a big injection this year.'

RADAMEL FALCAO

Former club: Monaco

Fee: Season-long loan

Man United appearances: 4

Man United goals: 1

One of the most lethal strikers in world football, Radamel Falcao's arrival - and the prospect of the Colombia sta playing up front with Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie - certainly got United fans excited.

However, having missed the World Cup through injury and lacking fitness, Ferguson believes the club made the correct decision in loaning the Monaco frontman rather than signing him permanently.

'The big one is Falcao who we're all waiting to see. Obviously, he has fantastic goalscoring ability. He had his injury so getting him on loan is the right thing to do,' said the former United manager.

DALEY BLIND 

Former club: Ajax

Fee: £14million

Man United appearances: 4

Man United goals: 0

Ferguson compared Dutchman Blind to fellow midfielder Darren Fletcher and believes the two players share a similar style.

Ferguson said: 'Daley Blind is one of those common-sense footballers that make up a team. He's probably a version of Darren Fletcher of a few years ago, that type of player. 

'He's a good professional with common sense to his game. He keeps it simple and protects the defenders and the attacking midfield players in his role.'

ANDER HERRERA 

Former club: Athletic Bilbao

Fee: £29million

Man United appearances: 4

Man United goals: 2

Ferguson is a big admirer of Ander Herrera and revealed the Spanish midfielder had been on the radar for quite sometime before finally moving to Old Trafford in the summer.

'Herrera played against us three years ago for (Athletic) Bilbao in the Europa League. In fairness, they gave us a right battering at Old Trafford,' said Ferguson.

'He's a talented young player and we scouted him quite a lot at that time. Obviously I think they tried to get him last year but it fell through for some reason or another.

'He's athletic, quite aggressive actually for a lad who has not got a great frame and he's quite slim but he's quite aggressive and he gets around the pitch.'

LUKE SHAW 

Former club: Southampton

Fee: £30million

Man United appearances: 2

Man United goals: 0

Man United attempted to sign left back Shaw long before the youngster made his Premier League debut for Southampton.

The 19-year-old, who played in England's final group game at the World Cup, became the most expensive teenager when he eventually signed for Manchester United in a £31m deal shortly after the summer tournament in Brazil.

'The signing of Shaw was the one we tried to get when he was 16 years of age,' said Ferguson. 'They wouldn't sell him to us but they always said we'd be first to know if they ever did.'

'Of course, Ed Woodward has carried that through and we got him for, I think it was £30m. He's a talented boy, a good footballer who likes to get forward all the time.'

MARCOS ROJO

Former club: Sporting Lisbon

Fee: £16million

Man United appearances: 4

Man United goals: 0

Argentina defender Rojo, 24, impressed Ferguson during the World Cup and can play in a number of position across the backline.

Ferguson said: 'Rojo, the Argentinian boy, I watched him at the World Cup, I thought he did really well for them and I think he's capable of playing either left side as a wing back if you like or as a centre back.'
