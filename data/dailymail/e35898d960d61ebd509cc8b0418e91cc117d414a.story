A homophobic passenger at a Texas airport had to be subdued by a group of spectators on Thursday after he began bullying and assaulting a man waiting to board his flight.

Footage on YouTube of the brawl at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport shows a man teasing another passenger for wearing a pink shirt at Gate 30 in Terminal C.

The unprovoked ringleader of the fight can be seen removing his jacket as he continues to shout at the man in the pink shirt.

Assault: The crazed man then kicks the innocent passenger after calling him homophobic slurs

Team effort: Passengers along with airport security tackled the man so they could get him into cuffs

A concerned onlooker in a black cowboy hat then asks what the screaming man what he is so upset about.

'Queers is what I am upset about! This f****t right here!' said the man, motioning at the innocent man in the pink shirt.

'Show it up your a** man,' the attacker, who appeared intoxicated, yelled.

The angered man then kicks the victim in the pink skirt and also hits him in the head, reports WTSP.

Another passenger vehemently asks why the man attacked the man in the pink shirt completely unprovoked.

'You want me to tell you the reason why I did it? Because this is America, that's why. The same reason you get to live to breathe to walk black' he said with fury.

Violent: Passengers say that the man appeared to be intoxicated and said he was acting like a crazy person

Arrested: Police arrested the man on Thursday but they would not disclose the man's identity 

Dragged away: The violent man had to be dragged away from other passengers after attacking one in pink

Passengers captured the events on cell phone cameras and speculated as to why he was so angry at the man in the pink shirt.

Some onlookers said they thought the attacker might be on some sort of drug that made him behave that way.

'That guy was crazy... absolutely crazy,' said Andrew Kennedy, who managed to capture footage of the event that later went viral.

'We saw a very troubled man, ‘said Kennedy's brother Andrew.

'We hope that he was under the influence of some kind of substance, because if he wasn't and that's his true personality, then he's going to have a long road in front of him.'

Police have not openly identified the suspect in this case though an arrest was made on Thursday.

As the man is being put into handcuffs he can be seen smiling into the camera.
