British pensioners who live abroad could be the first to lose their winter fuel allowance under government plans to save millions of pounds from the welfare bill.

Officials have been ordered to find a way to claw back up to £16million paid to people living outside the UK to help with their fuel bills.

It comes as senior minister Ken Clarke signalled that the Tory pledge to protect universal benefits is likely to be ditched in the next election manifesto.

Ministers want to stop expat pensioners living in hot parts of Europe like the Costa del Sol from claiming help with winter fuel bills

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith yesterday suggested future generations of pensioners could lose some of their universal benefits like winter fuel allowance, free TV licences and bus passes.

He has vowed to honour David Cameron’s pre-election pledge to protect the benefits until 2015, because pensioners are less able to increase their income than someone in work if benefits are suddenly cut.

But he suggested that beyond 2015 new pensioners might not enjoy the same perks.

Mr Duncan Smith is understood to be furious at a European Court of Justice ruling that will hugely increase the bill for Britons who live abroad claiming winter fuel allowance.

Under current rules it can only be claimed by someone who moves overseas after turning 60.

But the ruling said that anyone could claim it regardless of when they left the UK.

Latest figures show that in 2011-12, £16million was paid to in winter fuel allowance to people not living in the UK.

Today it emerged that officials are considering setting a qualifying threshold based on an average winter temperature, so that people living in Britain would qualify even if there was a mild spell.

‘Clearly it is a crazy idea that pensioners living in hot places abroad in Europe should be receiving winter fuel payments,’ a source said.

‘We are looking into seeing if there is something we can do around setting an average temperature in order to get round the European Court of Justice ruling. It is important that taxpayers’ money is used to help pensioners here.

‘An average temperature rule would ensure people here get it regardless.’

The winter fuel allowance is worth £200 for single pensioners, rising to £300 for the over 80s. Around 12million people receive it each year.

But critics have said it should be limited to poorer people who need extra help with their fuel bills.

Last week former Lib Dem minister Paul Burstow suggested just the 2million poorest should be eligible, saving around £1.5billion.

Senior ministers are pushing Mr Cameron to ditch his pledge to protect the allowance.

Mr Clarke today suggested the Tory leader had been rushed into promising not to cut them, and it would be an ‘agenda’ item for the next Conservative manifesto.

Mr Clarke said: ‘Before the election the Labour party started putting out leaflets accusing us of planning to take away benefits from pensioners.

‘Very rapidly a promise was given that we wouldn’t reduce benefits to pensioners,’ he told BBC Radio 4.

"We actually tied ourselves down for this parliament not addressing them. They, I’m sure, when we get round, which we haven’t yet, contemplating our manifesto for the next election they’ll be an agenda item.’
