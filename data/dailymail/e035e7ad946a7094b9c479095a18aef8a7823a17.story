This is the first picture of the four-year-old who died after being struck by a falling mirror at a Hugo Boss shop.

Austen Harrison, of Crawley, West Sussex, was killed earlier this month at the Bicester Shopping Village in Oxfordshire.

His parents have now released a photograph of their son and issued a public statement through their solicitor.

Mr and Mrs Harrison, whose full names were not given, said: 'Austen was a bright and vibrant boy who injected life into everything he touched.

Austen Harrison, four, from Crawley, West Sussex, has been named as the boy who died after being struck by a mirror in a Hugo Boss shop at Bicester Outlet Village in Oxfordshire

'His energy and creativity will be missed every day by all who met him and by those who did not have the privilege to meet him.'

The family is planning to set up a foundation in Austen's name to help improve the lives of other children, the family added.

Tragedy struck as the family shopped in the outlet store at around 8.40pm on June 8.

It is not yet known how big the mirror was or what caused it to fall but Thames Valley Police and Oxfordshire County Council's Environmental Health department are investigating.

An inquest into Austen's death is set to be opened in Oxford tomorrow.

Retailer Hugo Boss released a statement today about the tragic death of Austen Harrison.

It read: 'All of us at Hugo Boss remain devastated at the death of Austen Harrison on Saturday June 8th after the accident on June 4th.

'It is a terrible tragedy, we are receiving condolences for the family from Hugo Boss employees and other people from all over the world who share their sympathies.

'We will continue assisting the authorities in any way with an investigation into the accident.'

An off-duty doctor treated the boy until emergency services arrived at the store.

The Health and Safety Executive said 
that they were not involved in the investigation as shops are the 
responsibility of local authorities.

The Bicester Village also published a statement at the time.

It
said: 'Everyone at Bicester Village is deeply saddened by this tragic 
accident. We send our heartfelt condolences to the family and our 
thoughts and prayers are with them.
