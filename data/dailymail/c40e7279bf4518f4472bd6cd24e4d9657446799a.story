Well-off: Anthony Jarrard, 50, had £160,000 in the bank and earned money from fixing and teaching guitar and playing in a popular local band

A benefits cheat who played guitar in a band called Shady Deal has been ordered to pay back more than £157,000.

Anthony Jarrard, 50, dishonestly pocketed council tax benefit, jobseeker's allowance, income support and incapacity benefit, while neglecting to declare that he owned a house in Braintree, Essex.

The talented musician claimed to be unemployed but earned money from playing in his band, and teaching and fixing the guitar, Ipswich Crown Court heard.

He also had tens of thousands
of pounds in savings.

The unscrupulous criminal was only caught out when he was arrested for
shoplifting at Halfords in Lowestoft, Suffolk, in 2009 and was found to have a 
Halifax bank card in another name.

He initially claimed he had found it in the town centre but later admitted the card belonged to him and told officers he had opened the account in a fake name to avoid paying Poll Tax.

Suffolk Police's Financial Investigation
Unit began looking into his circumstances and discovered he had been 
claiming benefits since 1995.

Jarrard had owned his home in 
Braintree since 1998 and when he began claiming council tax benefit in 
2003 he had £69,000 savings in his bank account, the judge heard.

Jarrard admitted three offences of failing to notify a change in circumstances while claiming benefit.

Lies: Jarrard fraudulently claimed council tax benefit, jobseeker's allowance, income support and incapacity benefit, Ipswich Crown Court heard

He also admitted one charge of making a false representation to obtain benefit and was jailed last November for 12 months.

Between 2003 and 2010 a
massive £70,000 was paid into Jarrard's account and by March last 
year the balance had soared to £158,000.

The ceiling for savings to claim benefit was £16,000.

'Addicted to money': Jarrard was jailed last November for claiming £34,000 in benefits while failing to declare that he owned a house in Braintree, Essex and had thousands of pounds of savings

After hearing the offender's available assets were £163,960, Judge Rupert Overbury made a confiscation order yesterday for £157,495.

The court decided he had only managed to save up his money because of his 'criminal lifestyle'.

Jarrard fiddled more than £34,000 over a period of seven years, the court heard, and will have to  pay £30,338 to the Department of Work and Pensions and £4,507 to Braintree District Council.

He claimed incapacity benefit in 2004 after he had an accident.
Jarrard insisted he was suffering anxiety and could not raise his shoulder.

Judge John Devaux told Jarrard as he jailed him: 'You weren't driven by gambling or a drug addiction.

'It could be said your addiction was money itself.'

At Jarrard's sentencing hearing last 
November, his barrister Christopher Paxton said the popular local group 
played in pubs and clubs around Braintree.

But Mr Paxton wryly told the court: 'They weren't the Rolling Stones.'

He said Jarrard had lived a frugal and reclusive lifestyle and his claim for benefits had not been fraudulent from the outset.

Suffolk Police Financial investigator Rachel Jarvis said: 'The Financial Investigation Unit in Suffolk strives to ensure that those who commit crime and benefit financially will be forced to pay back the profits they have made from their activities.

'This case in particular demonstrates that by applying the Proceeds of Crime Act legislation, we can ensure that criminals do not prosper from acting dishonestly and will be brought to justice.'
