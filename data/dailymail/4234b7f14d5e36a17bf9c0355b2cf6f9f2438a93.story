Fit mom Maria Kang has launched a new campaign celebrating more than 100 'no excuse' parents who have overcome their reasons for not working out and made exercising a part of their daily lives.  

The 34-year-old mom rose to fame in 2013 when she shared a controversial photo of her toned body posed next to her three young sons with the tagline: 'What's Your Excuse?' Although she was accused of 'fat-shaming', among other things, she used her notoriety to form The No Excuse Mom Group, in which she started hundreds of free workout communities in more than 25 countries.

Ms Kang, whose No More Excuses Diet book is debuting next week, is now prompting her fans and fellow exercise enthusiasts to share their own photos and stories as a part of her No More Excuses campaign.

The posters, which are being shared across a number of social media platforms, feature images of men and women who have incorporated fitness into their lives along with bullet points explaining their past excuses, their reasons for changing their ways and their current successes.  

While the 'stars' of the movement come in all shapes and sizes, they are all proud of their progress and the difficulties they had to overcome. 

Ms Kang has even shared her own picture, in which she notes that she has excess skin, stretchmarks and has been publicly criticized and even called a bad mother.

'Deep Breath...I don't like showing my "flaws", but I'm a hypocrite if I don't accept all of me,' she wrote on Facebook of the photo. 'You will notice hundreds of No More Excuses pictures flooding social media this week - so here is mine.'

She added: 'I was called a lot of mean things in the past year, but one thing's for sure...sometimes the best response, is a revolution!'

In addition to revealing her own photo, the new author has been posting others' images to her Facebook page and thanking them for sharing their inspirational stories.

'Incredibly proud of some of the images flooding my timeline today,' she wrote earlier this week. 'It doesn't matter where you are, stop making excuses and change will happen. ‪#‎nomoreexcuses‬.'

Ms Kang, who quickly worked off her baby weight after all three of her pregnancies, has been married to former marine David Casler since 2010. Their boys are now aged six, four and three. 

The busy mom is also the owner of elderly residential care homes and the founder of her nonprofit Fitness without Borders, which funds her No Excuse Mom Group.

And now she is sharing her 'long-term and sustainable' diet and fitness plan with her new book, which she called a 'labor of love'.

But Ms Kang had her own body struggles throughout her twenties.

'I was bulimic,' she told Cosmopolitan. 'I was addicted to the endorphins in my body every single time I vomited. It went on from about age 23 until I was 27.'

She eventually overcame her eating disorder and began to live a healthier lifestyle. During her first pregnancy, she started to love and value her body more than ever. 

Life changing: Ms Kang rose to fame in 2013 after she shared this controversial picture. Many people accused her of 'fat-shaming' other mothers 

Big goals: She is now the author of her own No More Excuses Diet book, which hits shelves next week 

Before and After: Ms Kang, who has three songs ages six, four and three, said it took her about eight months to lose the weight after each of her pregnancies 

And while she lost the baby weight after each of her pregnancies, she doesn't expect new mothers to be back in their skinny jeans in a month. 

'It's not like I snapped back - it took me eight months,' she explained. 'My average weight loss per week was half a pound, which is not a lot of weight.'

Ms Kang maintained that it is 'just so annoying' to hear excuses.  

'I think that you either want it or you don't,' she said. 'You really have to make that choice, take accountability, and own your actions.'
