A bride and groom have been arrested as they tied the knot after stripping naked in the street to campaign against San Francisco's ban on public nudity.

Police swooped on ex-stripper turned activist Gypsy Taub, 44, and groom Jamyz Smith, 20, within a few minutes of them exchanging vows.

According to SFGate.com,
 she told the gathered congregation: 'This is a protest against the 
nudity ban as much as it is a wedding. I know that the people of San 
Francisco are behind me.'

The couple had derobed outside San Francisco City Hall after a yearlong campaign to highlight what they believe is a draconian restriction on their ability to be naked in public.

The service was conducted by nudity activist George Davis, an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church.

After a short reading from his 'holy book,' entitled 'Erotic Art,' Davis said: 'I pronounce you man and wife,' adding: 'Kiss and conjugate.'

Officers from the local police department wrapped the newly wed couple into blanks and bundled them into separate vans as they shared a dance on the pavement during the service yesterday.

'People celebrate in whatever way they feel comfortable,' one of the well-wishers told SFGate.com, adding: 'It's a wonderful thing that they are doing. Nobody is being hurt. Nobody is being damaged.'

According to a law enacted by the 
Board of Supervisors in 2012 bans public nudity on streets, sidewalks 
and transit stations and vehicles.

It makes exceptions for young children and participants in parades and fairs that have received permits.

Some of the wedding party held banners targeting the man they fell is responsible for the introducing the ban, the unfortunately named Scott Wiener, some of which read: 'Mind your own Wiener,' 'Scott Wiener should be aware of his own shortcomings,'

Taub was later issued a citation and released provided that she put the gown back on.
