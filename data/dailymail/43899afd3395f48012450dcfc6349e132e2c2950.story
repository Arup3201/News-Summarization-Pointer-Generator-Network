Passengers on an 11-hour United Airlines flight were outraged when the plane ran out of toilet paper during the journey.

Flight 931 was on its way from San Francisco to London on June 16 when crew made the unfortunate discovery.

Their response however has sent the story viral - as flight crew, apparently without irony, placed napkins in the bathroom as a makeshift solution. The branded napkins read: 'Fly by the tips of your fingers.'

Improvised: United Airlines crew left these napkins (with an ill-timed slogan) in the onboard bathroom after they ran out of toilet paper on an 11-hour flight from San Francisco to London

The picture was posted on the message board Flyertalk by someone called SFO_Runner.

He wrote: 'Apparently, they ran out in one lav half-way home and couldn't bother to transfer a roll from another.

'And before you ask, I went BACK to the lav AFTER I saw this. Didn't have the phone with me the first time.'

In a statement, a United Airlines spokesman told MailOnline: 'The aircraft ran low on toilet tissue and our crew improvised and provided customers with paper napkins.

'We apologize to our customers on this flight for the inconvenience and would like the opportunity to welcome them back.'

The company came last in a customer service survey released in April.

Uncomfortable: Passengers were faced with no toilet paper on an 11-hour United Airlines flight

United Airlines is currently facing a lawsuit filed last month by an 18-year-old California high school student who claimd that flight attendants failed to address a passenger who was masturbating in front of her.

Monica Amestoy, a senior at Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy, said the incident took place on October 21 aboard United Flight 771 while she was traveling back to LA after taking part in a debate tournament in New York.

Then-17-year-old Amestoy said she was terrified and disgusted seeing the stranger pleasuring himself across the aisle from her, and she immediately notified a flight attendant. But she said that 'to her horror,' no action was taken against the passenger because he could not be relocated.

The Amestoy familyâ€™s lawsuit, filed against United Airlines and United Continental Holdings, accuses the company of negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment, and seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.

In response to the suit, the airline said in a statement: 'The comfort and security of our customers is our top priority, and we will closely review this complaint when we receive it.'
