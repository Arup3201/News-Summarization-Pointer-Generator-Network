Model and socialite Kristina Matthaus, the former wife of a retired German soccer star, has been arrested in Manhattan for allegedly going on a $5,000 shopping spree at a luxury department store  with her boyfriend’s stolen credit card.

Matthaus, who also goes by the name Liliana Nova, was taken into custody at her apartment in Chelsea Wednesday evening

On Thursday, the 26-year-old Ukrainian national was arraigned on a single count of grand larceny.

High-end taste: Police say Matthaus used her boyfriend's card to make thousands of dollars worth of purchases at Bergdorf Goodman, and also bought airline tickets

Police say the model swiped an American Express credit card from her boyfriend, top financial adviser Michael Hadjedj, which she then used without his consent to buy clothes and accessories at Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue, according to New York Daily News.

The New York Post reported that she also charged plane tickets to the card to fly to Europe for a rendezvous with another man. 

Matthaus was apprehended just before 8pm Wednesday after returning from her trip. 

Ms Matthaus is a former spouse of German soccer manager and former player Lothar Matthaus, 53, who is best known for leading West Germany to victory in the 1990 World Cup.

Called it quits: After only two years of marriage, the couple separated in 2010 amid rumors of infidelity

The Ukrainian beauty, born Kristina Chudinova, met the thrice-divorced 47-year-old Matthaus at a beer hall during Oktobefest in 2007, and the couple got married the following year in Las Vegas.

The husband and wife separated in 2010 amid rumors of infidelity on Ms Matthaus' part.

The 5-foot-10 brunette reportedly sued her ex-husband later that year in a bid to to compel him to pay 3,000 euros for a breast reduction surgery.

Her most recent  boyfriend, Hadjedj, is the co-founder and CEO of the Manhattan-based financial management firm United First Partners.

Matthaus was released on her own recognizance Thursday evening. She is due back in court August 12.

Jilted lover: Matthaus' attorney insists the larceny charge is her boyfriend's way of getting back at her for breaking up with him

If convicted of a third-degree grand larceny charge, she could face up to seven years in prison.

The suspect’s attorney, Mark Jay Heller, insisted that his client had permission to use Hadjedj's credit card, and that he pressed charges against her as payback for breaking up with him after a nine-month relationship.

‘She is considered a treasure by German society and has conducted her life in an exemplary fashion,' said Heller, who also has represented Lindsay Lohan and her mother.
