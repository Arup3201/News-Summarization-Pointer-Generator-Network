It was said to have been a double celebration - not only Mother's Day but a fifth birthday party their only daughter.

But a family of five were killed on Sunday in a horrific car crash in San Bernadino County, after a van crashed into them, overturned, and landed on top of their car.

The driver of the van - who is said to have swerved into the left-hand side and hit the Honda sedan, which was stationary at a stop sign in Hesperia - escaped with only minor injuries.

Relatives of the victims - a 25-year-old mother, her husband, two sons, 9 and 2, and daughter, 4 - said they were on their way to Disneyland, which is a about a one hour and 20 minute drive away in Arnaheim, according to CBS LA.

Tragedy: A family of five were killed when a van landed ontop of their car in Hesperia, California, on Sunday. They were heading to Disneyland for the day

The adult male and the eldest son, 9, managed to make it out of the wreck, but died after being transported to hospital

The driver of the van made it out with only minor injuries and was treated at the scene. No arrests have been made

The girl, whose birthday they were celebrating at the theme park, would have been five on Monday.

'I’ve been to scenes where families have suffered great loss (but) all at once, in such a violent manner, is very rare,' sheriff’s Sgt. Doug Hubbard told KTLA.

The collision occurred just before 7.00 am at Main Street and Balsam Avenue in Hesperia, the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department said.

Investigators determined that the van was traveling eastbound on Main Street when it went into westbound lanes, collided with a Honda sedan that was stopped at a stop sign, and landed on top of the car.

Horrific: It wasn't until after the van was removed from on top of the car that the body of the two-year-old boy was found

Crushed: The family were driving to Disneyland in Arnaheim for the day when the crash occurred. They were stopped at a stop sign

The husband and the nine-year-old son made it out of the vehicle and were transported to hospital, but were later pronounced dead.

The mother and her daughter were trapped inside the car and pronounced dead at the scene.

Tragically, it wasn't until the van was lifted off the car, hours after the crash, that authorities found the body of the two-year-old.

Tributes: A man lights candles by a cross erected by people in the area. Five candles were placed at the site to remember the family that was lost

None of the victims have been identified, pending notification of their next of kind.
