Princess Beatrice has been likened to a benefit scrounger after taking three luxury holidays within weeks of quitting her job.

The 26-year-old and her boyfriend Dave Clark, 32, have enjoyed two breaks in the Caribbean and one in the upmarket Swiss ski resort of Verbier since she left her £20,000-a-year post at Sony Entertainment Pictures in December.

First, the couple took a holiday at her parents’ £13million ski chalet. Then they jetted out on trips to the exclusive island of St Barts – the second one just last week.

Princess Beatrice has enjoyed two holidays to the Caribben island of St Barts. The first came at the turn of the year, left, and she was pictured again in St Barts last Friday, right

It’s official, we think we may have found the perfect beach bag. Sophie Anderson’s hand-woven rainbow colour bags with their bohemian prints, tassels, and pom poms belong nowhere other than on a sunny desert island.

A favourite amongst the fash pack, Princess Beatrice was the latest jet setter to be spotted with one of these covered pieces of arm candy. Opting for a blue, orange and yellow Sophie Anderson tasselled shoulder bag, Princess Beatrice teamed her tote with an all-black ensemble on holiday in Saint Barts.

Unfortunately, you can’t buy Princess Beatrice’s exact bag online. However, Net-a-Porter have some great colour-ways (click right) and Matches have a floral version which is currently in the sale (click below).

Despite no longer having a personal income, Beatrice has two grace-and-favour homes – at her family’s Royal Lodge in the grounds of Windsor Castle and a four-bedroom apartment at St James’s Palace, rented for her by her father Prince Andrew for £20,000 a year.

The London flat was given a £250,000 taxpayer-funded makeover in 2008, before she moved in as a student at Goldsmiths College, where she studied for a BA in History and History of Ideas.

The princess’s jet-set lifestyle was attacked by anti-monarchy campaigners who said she should not receive public subsidies unless she was performing royal duties.

In December, she visited the upmarket Swiss ski-resort of Verbier visiting her parent's £13million ski chalet 

Beatrice joined Sony in January 2014 but she quit her post as an ‘intermediate coordinating producer’ based in London after details of her salary were revealed when Sony’s computer systems were hacked by a group thought to be linked to North Korea.

Even while working, the princess – sixth in line to the throne – managed eight luxury breaks abroad.

 In 2014, she travelled to Aspen, Colorado, twice to St Barts, and took trips to Spain, New York, Memphis, Abu Dhabi and Verbier.

The Abu Dhabi trip in November saw her take leave from work to join her father at the Grand Prix.

In June, she managed to hitch a lift with the Royal Navy for a trip to the Isle of Wight. 

She managed ten holidays the previous year, visiting the South of France three times, St Barts, Verbier, Venice, South Africa, Spain, Antigua and New York.

Buckingham Palace has insisted that the princess’s travel was ‘entirely privately funded’ – helped by her parents and boyfriend, who is believed to earn a six-figure salary working for Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic space tourism project. 

The Duke of York’s official website continues to state Beatrice ‘works full time in business’ and emphasises her charity work which includes being a patron of six organisations. 

The princess and her sister Eugenie have also carried out royal visits on behalf of the Queen.

But Graham Smith, head of the pressure group Republic, said: ‘Beatrice is a royal scrounger. She has the HRH title and is living off the taxpayer by using subsidised housing. 

'But she’s not putting the hours in so she shouldn’t be getting any money off the state. She either ought to pull her finger out or quit. 

'Maybe it’s time she gave up her HRH and abandoned her subsidised apartments in the palace.

‘If she becomes a private individual and doesn’t need to work then that’s entirely up to her.’

A spokesman for the Duchess of York, 55, defended her daughter. He said: ‘Her key focus is her work.’
