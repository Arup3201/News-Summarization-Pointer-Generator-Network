James Milner believes England’s World Cup flop in Brazil will be one of the driving forces behind the quest for success at Euro 2016.

Roy Hodgson’s team started the campaign with a win in Switzerland and continue with game at home to San Marino on Thursday and away in Estonia on Sunday.

'You don’t forget about the World Cup, it’s always there,' said Milner.

'We haven’t forgotten about it. But you always try to move forward. We had a couple of good results and we have to build on them.'

The Manchester City midfielder also shared an insight into Roy Hodgson's unit meetings before discussing the spirit in the England camp.

He added: 'It’s not a new thing. We have team meetings as a full team. Over last couple of years we’ve had unit meetings to work on specific sections of the pitch and then go into a big meeting. 

'The manager wants to voice an opinion. He wants our feedback as well. He wants discussions on what best for the team. I think those meetings help.

'No player will ever sit here and say it’s a terrible atmosphere but it’s a great bunch of lads. It’s a tight knit group.

'People sit there chatting after dinner enjoying each other’s company, especially after coming out of tournaments where you’ve had a bad time.

'The talk around the team in Switzerland wasn't good and that’s when you need your team spirit.'

Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana also praised the team spirit within the England dressing room.

The 26-year-old former Southampton man, who made the switch to Anfield this summer, made his England debut in a friendly against Chile last November and has since won eight further caps ahead of this qualifying double header.

Ahead of Thursday's match against San Marino at Wembley, Lallana said: 'The atmosphere has always been brilliant and a great place to work. With Stevie (Gerrard) as captain and with Wayne (Rooney) now, there's always a great feeling.

'Obviously you have good and bad times. When you lose the dressing room's always down but we always back each other up and have to go again.

'On the back of a disappointing World Cup, the last time the lads met up they put in some great performances especially against Switzerland and showed great character and showed that we have got a great team spirit and a great dressing room.'
