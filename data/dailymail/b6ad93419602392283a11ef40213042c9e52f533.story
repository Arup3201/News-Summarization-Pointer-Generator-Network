David Cameron yesterday accused Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby of ‘talking down’ the North of England.

In unusually direct criticism, the Prime Minister described the Church of England’s views on the North as ‘outdated’ and ‘condescending’.

His comments follow a recent article by the Archbishop in which he said ‘entire cities are being cast aside and left to their own devices’.

David Cameron has called Archbishop Justin Welby's views on the North 'outdated' and 'condescending' after a Church of England report said the region is heading backwards while the South surges ahead

Archbishop Welby also claimed that most of the country outside London and the South East had been left ‘abandoned and hopeless’, watching the wealth of the capital grow while they are trapped in a ‘vicious circle of decline’.

Mr Cameron has now hit back, telling BBC Radio Manchester the Church was guilty of ‘just painting a picture that everything in the North is somehow going in the wrong direction’. 

Cameron pointed to Manchester as a revived city where unemployment rates have been lower in recent years than in London

He said: ‘Where I don’t agree with some of the things the Church of England said is I think there was an element of talking down the performance of some of our cities, including cities like Manchester, which in recent years have seen something of a revival.

‘When you look at the transport investment in Manchester, when you look at some of the infrastructure that’s being put in, you look at some of the great buildings that are going up, the growth in jobs, the fact that you’ve got a city council that’s working incredibly closely with the Government over issues like the ‘‘Northern powerhouse’’...

‘I thought the Church of England report rather outdated. I found it a bit condescending when it came to our great Northern cities. I don’t think it was really up to date on what is happening.

'I accept there are still regional disparities that we need to deal with but I don’t think we deal with them by just painting a picture that everything in the North is somehow going in the wrong direction and everything in the South is going in the right direction.’

Mr Cameron pointed out that employment rates in Manchester had been higher in recent years than those in London.

He added: ‘If you talk to the Manchester Chamber of Commerce or the chambers of commerce in cities like Leeds and Newcastle, I would rather hope they would say the same thing.’

The Prime Minister also defended the benefit cap which he has pledged to cut to £23,000 after the election if the Tories win.

He said: ‘I think it is right to say you shouldn’t get more [if you are] out of work than a family that is in work. 

'Otherwise we send a totally perverse signal that somehow it’s better off to spend a life on benefits when you can work.’
