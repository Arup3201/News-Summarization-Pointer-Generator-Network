Hurtling through the air at incredible speeds just metres from the rocky ground, this is the adrenaline-fuelled, extreme sport of wingsuit flying from the point of view of its world champion.

The jaw-dropping footage shows Espen Fadnes hurling himself off a mountain top as he takes to the skies above Chamoix, France, to show off his breathtaking skills.

Espen, from Trondheim, Norway, together with Project Managers Goovinn.se shot the amazing video among the beautiful French Alps for short film 'Split of a Second'.

Soaring at more than 150mph, Espen used a GoPro camera attached to his helmet to capture the footage as he flew past the jagged rocks just a few meters below.

He said: 'Wingsuit flying is my personal proving ground. It is a ground where there are no systems thatâ€™s limits me.

'It is me and only me that can shape my 
path for what to risk, achieve sense and learn.

'It gives me great 
pleasure, and increases my ability to face and embrace other parts of 
life.

'When I charge that hard in flying, I use all my mental capacity. Over and over again I flew with a neck microphone system for recording my voice in free fall.

'Every time I landed just to realize I yet again had flown down the mountain in total silence.'

Espen's
wing suit allows him to travel in-flight in a 'three to one' scale, 
meaning for every meter he travels forward, he travels three down.

Made
of lightweight fabrics that give increased lift, he is able to fly with
incredible accuracy before deploying a parachute to bring him safely 
back to earth.

He said: 'Physical challenges have always appealed to me.

'I
think it's from my childhood. I was never the best at answering 
questions in the classroom, but when it came to outdoor activities, I 
was talented and it gave me a sense of being good at something.

'Throughout my life, I've always preferred things like climbing, skiing and base jumping over more academic stuff.

In
that moment, when pushing off to jump, I never think about what's 
coming next. The past doesn't exist. The Future doesn't exist. There's 
only now.'

Espen is 
traveling to China later this month to take part in the World Wingsuit 
League where he will compete against 16 other base jumpers from around 
the world.
