A brave truck driver saved a diabetic man's life by swerving in front of his runaway car after he had a seizure at the wheel.

Father-of-four Bob Rennie, 46, overtook the out of control Peugeot and braked slowly to bring the car to a safe stop.

The trucker had followed the car for four minutes before deciding he had to take action to save the elderly motorist.

Hero truck driver: Bob Rennie, 46, who saved a diabetic driver by overtaking an out of control Peugeot and braking sharply to bring the vehicle to a standstill

As he pursued the runaway driver, Bob shouted down his radio: 'He's all over the road. He's going to kill somebody.'

The whole incident was caught on camera by a mobile phone mounted to his lorry's dashboard.

Bob, who works for Hebrides Haulage, was 
driving south on the A82 near Luss, Dunbartonshire, when the car suddenly began weaving across the road.

Footage shows the runaway car weave right then left before hurtling along the verge inches from trees and skimming the safety barrier.

It then drifts back towards the white lines before crossing on to the wrong side of the carriageway with cars heading towards it.

Bob, from Glasgow, said: 'When I saw someone was in trouble, I just used what means I had to help them,' he said. 'I'm just grateful that the man and his wife went home to their family and nobody was hurt.'

He added: 'A couple of miles down the road, I noticed a difference in his driving. Given how careful he had been before, I realised then that something was wrong.

'At first I wondered if he was drunk, but I would have noticed that sooner, so then I thought it must have been a health issue.'

Bob said he tried to warn other drivers in an effort to avoid an accident.

He said: 'My concern was to make sure no cars overtook and got between me and him and that everybody in the vicinity was safe.

'I was pumping my horn for two reasons, one was to try to get his attention and snap him out of whatever was wrong.

'The other was to warn oncoming drivers there was a problem. I had my hazards on and I was flashing my lights.'

Bob finally veered in front of the car when all other efforts to stop it failed.

Danger: With a car coming in the opposite direction, the out of control Peugeot swerves dangerously into the path of an oncoming car on the A82

He said: 'I don't know if the driver was going in and out of consciousness, but he obviously became aware that something was in front of him and that made him slow down and stop at the side of the road.

'I jumped out and ran right over to him. He was just sitting there as if he was dazed. He wasn't aware of what was happening.

'I gave him some water and a couple of biscuits. Another lorry driver dialled 999 and the police and ambulance arrived.'

The elderly driver - on holiday from Reading, Berkshire, with his wife - was treated at the scene by paramedics.

Bob said: 'The paramedics said he had low blood sugar. It was a very, very hot day, which didn't help.

'They were a lovely couple, so nice to speak to. I stayed with them for about an hour. He was still in the ambulance when I left.

'The man phoned me later that night from his hotel to say thank you.

'I hope he is still on the mend. It was just one of those unforeseen things.'

The Scottish Ambulance Service confirmed they took a casualty from the scene to the Vale of Leven Hospital in Alexandria.
