President Barack Obama has a final chance in Florida tonight night to halt Mitt Romney’s late surge and stave off a re-election defeat after plummeting in the polls after his disastrous first debate performance. 

Obama leads by a wafer-thin 0.2 per cent nationally in the RealClearPolitics poll of averages. 

But he is down seven in the Gallup 
tracking poll, down two in the Rasmussen poll and has seen his leads in 
Florida and Virginia disappear and his Ohio advantage whittled down to 
almost nothing.

The latest NBC/WSJ poll, which had Obama three points ahead before the debates, now puts the two candidates dead level on 47 points each among likely voters with six per cent undecided.

Although most pundits and post-debate polls have Obama the advantage over Romney following the second debate, he has seen no improvement in the polls and the momentum appears to remain with the Republican nominee.

The final presidential debate will focus on foreign policy - a traditional Republican strength that should be an advantage for Obama this time around because of the demise of Osama bin laden last May and the end of the Iraq war.

Indeed, Obama has served notice that he will play the bin Laden card to full advantage, saying in his speech at the Al Smith dinner in New York last week: 'Spoiler alert: We got bin Laden.'

At the vice-presidential debate in Kentucky, it took Vice President Joe Biden one minute and seven seconds into the first answer of the debate - to a question about Libya - to bring up bin Laden.

Libya, however, presents Obama with some problems.

Although Romney got tangled up in the weeds of whether Obama had referred to the Benghazi attack as a 'terrorist act,' during their last bout, the death of the first U.S. ambassador to be murdered in the line of duty since 1979 and the intelligence and security failures that led to it make the president very vulnerable.

In addition, it has become clear that 
the White House’s initial insistence that the attack was a result of 
protests about an anti-Islam video made in California were flat wrong - 
and possibly part of an official cover-up.

Despite his mistakes, and a disastrous visit to Britain in August when he managed to offend people by criticising the UK Olympics effort and was mocked by Prime Minister David Cameron and Mayor of London Boris Johnson, Romney has become much more fluent in foreign policy matters.

Before the two candidates first 
debated on October 3rd, Obama held a 15-point lead over Romney on the 
question of who was more capable of dealing with foreign affairs.

After Obama’s lackluster performance, a Pew Research Center poll found that the gap had closed to just four points.

On the eve of their final 
presidential debate, Romney and Obama - through their allies - squared 
off Sunday over which candidate would best protect the nation's 
interests and security abroad with just two weeks left in a race that 
polls show is increasingly tight.

Both candidates stayed largely out of view, preparing vigorously for their face-off focused on foreign policy.

Republicans accused Obama of leaking word of possible negotiations with Iran in pursuit of political gain.

Democrats shot back, arguing that Romney and his party are the ones playing politics with national security.

The haggling played out on Sunday 
news shows at a critical time for Romney and Obama, whose marathon race 
has become exceedingly close as it lurches toward its November 
conclusion.

Early and absentee voting are already
 under way in many of the most competitive states, upping the pressure 
on both candidates to lock in supporters.

Romney paused his preparations to 
attend church with his wife Sunday morning and to watch his traveling 
press corps play touch football against his senior staff.

The former Massachusetts governor presided over a coin toss on the beach, then gathered his aides to cheer them on.

'That's right, don't worry about injuries guys, this counts. Win,' he joked.

Romney didn't talk politics, refusing to answer a question about whether, if elected, he would be open to direct talks with Iran.

Questions from reporters about the new poll and Monday's debate likewise went unanswered.

Obama arrived Friday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, where he's been holding 12-hour practice sessions, starting with policy discussions at 10am.

Obama and his team hold mock debates in the evening in a set designed to look like the one in Boca Raton.
