Voters should scribble a rude word on their ballot paper if there is no candidate who represents their views, Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said today.

Miss Bennett said people should register to vote and cast their ballot rather than stay at home, even if they do not intend to back someone standing in their constituency.

She said: 'I would like you to vote Green, I would like you to vote for someone you believe in. But If there is no one on the ballot paper who you think represents your views, still go to the polling station and if you want to write a rude word on the ballot paper.'

The Green leader called for a major boost in turnout following the Scottish independence referendum last year when more than eight out of 10 voters cast their ballot.

She said: 'If people did that, people went out and voted, voted for what they believe in - whatever that is - we could actually have a peaceful political revolution.'

Miss Bennett made the comments at an Ask The Leaders event hosted by Sky News' and Facebook's this morning. 

She said people should not vote tactically but should back the party that best represents their views. 

'Because if you don't vote, if you don't turn up, if you don't register, you are counted with the "I'm happy enough with how things are" part of the group, and I don't think most people actually are,' she said.

The first-past-the-post system used in Westminster elections had trained people to 'vote very often for the person or party we dislike the second most to stop the people we really hate getting in', she said.

The Green leader said: 'If there is no one on the ballot paper who you think represents your views, still go to the polling station and if you want to write a rude word on the ballot paper'

A surge in support for the Green party could cost Labour 22 seats, a polling expert has warned.

The Greens have been boosted by a row over TV election debates, with David Cameron refusing to take part if the Greens were excluded.

Labour fears it could lose vital left wing votes to the smaller party, including former Lib Dem supporters.

Robert Ford of the University of Manchester, carried out analusis of local election results 2010.

It found 22 marginal seats Labour needs to win or cling on to where more than 10 per cent of voters are identified as being Labour/Green-inclined.

It includes Lib Dem strongholds such as of Bristol West, Norwich South and Cambridge, Tory-held Hove, and Brighton Kemptown, and Labour-held Birmingham Edgbaston and Tooting.

Mr Ford told The Observer: 'The voters fuelling the Green boom share one characteristic with supporters of the Ukip and SNP insurgencies – a deep-seated disaffection with the political establishment.

'Besides the general problem of disaffection, Labour also faces a specific problem with the Greens into political competition.

'Young, highly educated, cosmopolitan liberal idealists, Greens are more or less the polar opposite to Ukip's ageing, socially conservative, nationalist electorate. Labour is losing votes to both, but any policy that appeals to one pole will anger those at the other.'

Miss Bennett said: 'That's actually given us the kind of politics we have now. What we have done is we have seen, particularly the two largest parties, focus all their policies on the swing voters in the swing seats. They have ignored their core vote, they have ignored the whole issue of what's best for the country, but thought 'what do we say to get those swing voters?'. 'If voters keep voting the same way, you will keep getting the same politics.'

The Greens have received a boost in the polls over recent months, and Ms Bennett has been invited to appear in televised leaders' debates ahead of the general election.

But that has led to increased scrutiny about some of the party's policies - including whether a ban on people joining terrorist groups including al Qaida and Islamic State should be lifted.

Green Party policy states ''it should not be a crime simply to belong to an organisation or have sympathy with its aims, though it should be a crime to aid and abet criminal acts or deliberately fund such acts''.

On BBC One's Sunday Politics earlier this month, asked if that meant it would be allowed to be a member of al Qaeda or IS, she said: ''Exactly. What we want to do is make sure we are not punishing people for what they think or what they believe.'

Challenged about her views during the question and answer session on Sky News she appeared to indicated that membership of IS or al Qaeda would be illegal because of their support for violence.

She said: 'Obviously IS and al Qaeda are hideous terrorist organisations that advocate and support violence. If you are involved in them, support them in any way, then you are participating in inciting violence, that's a crime, rightly, and should be pursued to the full extent of the law.'

Ms Bennett said she does not support compulsory voting, because 'it suggests that voters are the problem'.

'I think, actually, politics is the problem,' she said. 'It's up to politicians to make politics exciting and involving and make people think it's worth voting.'

The Green leader said she traced her political philosophy back to her early childhood.

'I became a feminist at age five,' she said. 'I didn't know the word then, but at age five I was told 'Because you're a girl, you are not allowed to have a bicycle' and I thought 'That's not fair or reasonable'.

'That sense of fairness and the sense that so many people are stopped from realising their potential and doing what they want to do because of unfair rules and society imposing restrictions on them - that's what drives me.'

Ms Bennett won some applause from her young audience when she said that people need to 'stop blaming immigrants' for problems with low wages, housing and pressure on public services, which she said were down to Government failures.

She called for a higher minimum wage, devolution of political power to local regions, the scrapping of the planned HS2 rail link, a cap on private rents, the end of the right to buy council houses and the renationalisation of the railways.

And she said that the unpaid internships offered to many young workers were 'unfair and unreasonable and shouldn't happen'.

'We have a minimum wage that is not enforced,' said Ms Bennett. 'If you have a contract with a company that says you are going to turn up nine-to-five for six months, that is a job and it should be covered by the minimum wage.'
