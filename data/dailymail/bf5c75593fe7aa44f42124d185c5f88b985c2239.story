Saddened: Eva Gabrielsson has said Larsson would have 'furious' about the release of That Which Does Not Kill Us, the fourth book in the Millennium series

Stieg Larsson's partner has hit out at plans to release a fourth installment in the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series more than a decade after the journalist's death - dismissing it as nothing more than a money-making scheme.

Eva Gabrielsson has said Larsson would have 'furious' about the release of That Which Does Not Kill Us, which will hit the shelves in August to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the release of the hugely successful Girl with a Dragon Tattoo.

Gabrielsson -  the left wing journalist's partner of more than three decades - has not only questioned the motivation of the publishing house, but been hugely critical of the author chosen to follow in her late partner's footsteps.

David Lagercrantz, a journalist and author best known as footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic's official biographer, is 'a completely idiotic choice' in her view.

'They say heroes are supposed to live forever. That's a load of c***, this is about money,' she said.

'It's about a publishing house that needs money, (and) a writer who doesn't have anything to write so he copies someone else.'

Larsson had, in fact, begun work on a fourth book centering on protagonists Lisbeth Salander, a feisty rebel hacker-turned-detective, and Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter, before his untimely death in 2004.

Aged just 50, he suffered a heart attack as he walked the seven storeys to his office, where he worked as a journalist and editor of anti-fascist magazine Expo.

The books were published posthumously, so Larsson never saw how successful the books were to become: so far, they have sold more than 75million copies in more than 30 languages, according to publisher Norstedts.

However, Gabrielsson, 61, has dismissed any idea he had an overarching plan for the novels - a theory which has been used to justify the publication of this latest 500 page tome.

She also revealed Lagercrantz had not seen the fourth manuscript, and 'started over from zero'.

'Everyone thinks there was some grand scheme but no, he had no plan for the first three books and when he started writing the fourth one, it was spontaneous. He still didn't have a plan,' she said.

If it were up to her, none of this would have happened.

'I wouldn't have continued Stieg's work. It was his language, his unique narrative.' 

Furious?: Stieg Larsson - who died in 2004, before his trilogy became successful - had started work on the next book, but David Lagercrantz, who has picked up the baton, has started from scratch with his version

Gabrielsson says she views Lagercrantz is 'a completely idiotic choice' to continue Larsson's work, with even the 'very literary' title sitting badly with her.

She said: '[He] comes from a completely different background. Everything has always been easy for him. He's never been an activist. Everything is wrong.' 

Gabrielsson, who met Larsson as a teenager, added: 'Let him dig his own grave.'

For Gabrielsson, the publication is a bitter blow - the outcome of a bitter battle against her partner's family to manage his work.

Success: The books, which have sold millions around the world, have been made into blockbuster films

Following his death, Gabrielsson wanted to manage his authorship to avoid its commercialisation, but she says she never reached an agreement with Larsson's brother and father and they now manage his estate.

She says now 'there is nothing left to protect'.

But Gabrielsson, who only recently moved out of the home they shared as she tries to rebuild her life, believes the wrong things have happened - especially when it comes to the new book. 

'The worst thing is how saddened Stieg would have been. He never let anyone work on his literary texts. 

'He would have been furious. Who knows, maybe he'll send a lightning bolt at the book launch.'
