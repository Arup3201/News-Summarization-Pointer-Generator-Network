Muammar Gaddafi gave the go-ahead for a Libyan delegation to meet U.S. representatives in Tunisia yesterday

American officials have held a secret meeting with Colonel Gaddafi’s aides, telling them he must go before there can be an end to Nato bombing raids.

After the first face-to-face contact between the two sides since the start of the four-month war, the U.S. said there had been simply the delivery of a ‘firm message that the only way to move forward is for Gaddafi to step down’.

The move was seen as increasing the pressure on the beleaguered Libyan leader at a time when rebels are said to be making ‘firm progress’ in their military operations.

Rebels are said to have taken over the oil hub of Brega following intense fighting over the weekend that left at least 40 dead.

France has also held talks with Libyan officials and demanded that Gaddafi not only step down but go into exile.

But French Defence Minister Gerard Longuet said: ‘I am cautious because Gaddafi is not rational and he could opt for a bunker strategy, taking the whole civilian population of Tripoli hostage.’

In response to international demands, Libyan government spokesman Ibrahim Moussa said: ‘Any dialogue with the French, Americans, British is welcome... we will discuss everything, but do not condition your peace talks.

'Let Libyans decide their future.’

Last week more than 30 nations, including the U.S., dealt Gaddafi a major blow by recognising the rebels’ National Transitional Council as a legitimate government, releasing billions of pounds in assets that had been previously frozen.

However, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said yesterday that he believes compromise between Libyan rebels and the government is still possible.

He criticised Western states for taking sides by recognising the rebel leadership as legitimate government, emphasising that Moscow is in contact with both groups.

After a long period of stalemate in 
the desert along the eastern front, the rebels said they had routed most
of Gaddafi's troops in Brega to the west, which has an oil refinery and
terminal, and encircled the town.          

Rebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah said its streets were strewn with landmines, making it hard to secure full control.

'The main body (of Gaddafi's forces) 
retreated to Ras Lanuf,' which lies to the west, he said by telephone 
from the eastern rebel stronghold of Benghazi.

The government denied the claim.

Spokesman Ibrahim Moussa said: 'Our brave soldiers are in Brega in their thousands and control it completely.'

He said the government had lost 30 soldiers over five days of fighting, but rebels had lost many times more.

Libyan TV, in a bid to counter the 
rebel claims, showed what it said was footage taken on Monday of 
ordinary life in Brega, with students taking an exam and workers at a 
natural gas plant.
