Council environmental health worker Stewart Rosoman, 51, was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while unfit through drink after killing David Waterland in a high-speed crash

A council environmental health worker drank six pints of lager before driving a sports car at 110mph and crashing into another vehicle, killing its driver.

Stewart Rosoman, 51, was driving home his friend, Fred Gallow, after an evening in a pub in Milton Abbas, Dorset.

Rosoman, who works for West Dorset District Council, boasted of 'hitting 110mph' before veering into the wrong lane and smashing into a Honda Jazz travelling in the opposite direction.

Its driver, retired company director David Waterland, 68, was killed almost instantly.

His wife, Margaret, 66, was seriously injured in the crash, as was Mr Gallow.

Rosoman, whose work sees him instruct people on food hygiene, denied causing death by careless driving while unfit through drink, saying Mr Waterland was to blame after suffering a dizzy spell.

The council worker was found guilty and was told to expect a prison sentence.

Dorchester Crown Court heard that Rosoman and Mr Gallow spent the evening of May 15 last year drinking at the Hambro Arms pub in Milton Abbas, Dorset.

Rosoman drove them home in his MG convertible sports car and boasted to Mr Gallow ‘we have just hit 110 miles an hour' as he sped along Milton Road, near the village of Milton St Andrew.

Meanwhile Mr Waterland and his wife were returning home after spending the evening having dinner with friends in Wareham, Dorset.

Because of Rosoman's not guilty plea, Mrs Waterland was forced to relive the moment her husband was killed.

Mrs Waterland said her husband had been keeping to his side of the road with the lights on.

She said: 'Out of nowhere lights came towards us, [David] had nowhere to go.'

Patrick Mason, defending, suggested Mr Waterland might have had a dizzy spell or lost consciousness.

Mrs Waterland denied this and said that her husband was in fine health at the time.

Rosoman could not be breathalysed at the scene of the crash because he was injured, but a nurse who treated him in hospital said he gave off a ‘fairly overpowering’ smell of alcohol and that he told her he had drunk four pints, although the prosecution said it was six.

Mr Gallow said that he regretted not trying to get Rosoman to slow down during the ill-fated journey. 

He is still employed by West Dorset District Council. Chief Executive Matt Prosser said: 'The council would like to pass on its sincere condolences to the family and friends of the gentleman who died in this tragic collision.

'Once sentencing has taken place the council will conclude its investigation into the matter of Mr Rosoman’s position.'

Rosoman, a married father-of-two, was bailed until his sentencing on November 4.
