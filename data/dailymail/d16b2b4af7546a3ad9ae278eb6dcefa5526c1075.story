A New York man whose wife died just shy of their golden anniversary celebrated the special date anyway with a giant highway billboard.

Joe Mikolajczak of Buffalo contracted for the sign around the couple’s 49th anniversary. When his wife Marylou died five months before it was slated to go up, he decided just to let it go ahead.

‘It was just my way of saying “I love you,”’ he said.

Bittersweet: Joe Mikolajczak's wife died just five months shy of their golden anniversary. Though he'd arranged for the sign a year earlier and could have cancelled, he chose to celebrate their 50 years of love anyway

Mikolajczak intended to make the big statement no matter what. He even knew he could have gotten a refund had he so chosen.

‘About
 a week before she died, I told her what I was going to do, and all she 
did was look at me and tell me I'm nuts,’ he said. ‘But she was worth 
it. I wanted her to have some sort of recognition.’

The elegant sign depicts the lovely Marylou at their wedding in 1963 as well as more recently.

The touching words on the sign above I-190 South read: ‘I will love you forever, Joe.’

'You got to inject some kind of, let's say levity, into the marriage': Mikolajczak says he often surprised his wife during their nearly 50 years of marriage

‘I miss her every day. I cry every day. I cry every night, and I should cry,’ Mikolajczak told WGRZ. ‘Like I said, she was a beautiful woman inside and outside.’

The sign was evidently changed, if just a bit, to reflect Marylou’s passing. Instead of the dates of their wedding and anniversary, the sign shows the years of her birth and death, 1944 to 2013.

Marylou was 68 when she died just five months shy of the hallmark year.

Throughout their nearly 50 year marriage, Mikolajczak says surprises like the billboard were typical for him.

'You got to inject some kind of, let's say levity, into the marriage. Just to see her smile was worth it to me,' he said.
