British travellers are being warned not to travel to parts of Nigeria after Friday's terrorist bombing that left scores of people dead.

The death toll in the bombing, carried out by the radical Islamist group Boko Haram, in the northern city of Kano today rose to 178 but the number who died could still rise.

The Foreign office today updated its travel advice for the African country, with a warning that people should not travel to Kano.

Foreign Secretary William Hague also spoke about the attack, saying he was 'shocked and appalled' by the violence.

On its website, the FCO said: 'We 
advise against all travel to Kano whilst the curfew remains in force and
for those in Kano to remain vigilant and to exercise caution.

'DFID (Department for International 
Development) and British Council have limited their operations in Kano 
whilst the curfew is in place.'

It also urged British nationals in Nigeria to comply with all curfews.

Authorities have enforced a 24-hour curfew in the city, with many people remaining at home as soldiers and police patrolled the streets and set up roadblocks.

Mr Hague said: 'The nature of these attacks has sickened people around the world and I send my deepest condolences and sympathies to the families of those killed and to those injured.

'There is no place in today's world for such barbaric acts and I condemn in the strongest possible terms those who carried them out.

'These events underline the importance of the international community standing together in the face of terrorism in all its forms.'

'Those causing havoc will never 
succeed ... The federal government will not rest until the perpetrators 
are brought to book. We will not rest until these terrorists are wiped 
out.'
