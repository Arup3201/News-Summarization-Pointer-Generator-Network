It's the stuff of nightmares - going for a life-changing  operation only to realise you have ended up with a botched up body.

Yet for mother-of-six Sue MacManus, who lost a nipple in a horrifying complication after breast reduction surgery, and Hannah Costayer, who was left with wonky lips after plumping injections, this is their reality.

The two women starred on tonight's Botched Up Bodies on Channel 5 and have suffered immensely thanks to their bungled surgery.

Jacob was once 24 stone but he lost so much weight he's been left with sagging skin and drooping nipples

They featured on the show alongside a young man called only Jacob who, having lost an incredible amount of weight has ended up with such sagging skin, his nipples droop to his ribcage. 

Although Hannah was a pretty teen at just 18 she decided to have lip injections, not knowing that they would change her appearance forever. 

The procedure initially went well but she soon started to notice problems. Hannah's bottom lip started to swell and in time became lumpy. 

She said: 'One side of the lip became bigger and bigger and the other side just stayed the same.

'The skin is so stretched that it is cracking and bleeding all the time. It is so upsetting you can no longer feel confident around people because you are aware of the problem and you behave in a certain way.' 

Although Hannah tried to have her lips fixed, a second lip job saw little improvement and she is now looking at having another operation. 

'After examining my lips the doctor said that the filler had gone into my connective tissue and in order to make my lips smaller he needs to extract part of the tissue.

Hannah Costayer's lip job left her with wonky lips which she has had surgery to correct that hasn't worked 

'He needs to make an incision and cut part of my lip out and sew it back together,' she said of her third consultation. 

Meanwhile, having ballooned, Jacob lost an incredible amount of weight that left him with sagging skin that looked like an old man's. The doctor Peter revealed it would take four operations to return him to a normal state.

He said during surgery which removed six and a half stone of excess skin: 'One of the problems with the skin with young people who have lost a lot of weight the skin is stretched anyway so it's not the best quality material to work with. 

'You can imagine that when Jacob was 24st the blood vessels behind that huge amount of tissue were huge too so when he loses his weight his vessels don't go away and they remain very big which means he is prone to bleeding which means we have to take our time with the surgery.' 

And then there was Sue. Sue had spent her life feeling unhappy with her size 38G breasts and decided to go under the knife to have a breast reduction.

But when she came around from the operation she instantly noticed something was wrong. 

She said: 'It was very uncomfortable having large breasts. I was a 38G. I had a lot of backache and shoulder ache, so I asked my GP if it would be possible to have the operation done. 

'I was looking forward to having smaller breasts and not having the back pain any more and just to feel normal.'

'I was in the theatre for about five or six hours and when I woke up I was losing a lot of blood. At the time I could feel that there was blood oozing out of the right breast. 

And then the unthinkable happened: 'When I had to go and see the consultant the day after I was still losing a lot of blood, I was still bleeding heavily. 

'As he took the dressing off to check, the nipple actually just came off with the dressing.'

But according to research Sue's not alone, the hit TV series revealed that up to five per cent of those going under the knife will lose a nipple. 

Hannah's lips were normal before she had lip injections at just 18 which left her with a lop-sided smile 

And while Sue was devastated, her doctor didn't seem to see it as an issue: 'He was just quite blasé about it and he just said I'm sorry but your nipple's died and it's come off.'

But things were only going to get worse for Sue who had developed necrosis, when body tissue dies,  and was admitted straight back to hospital.

Sue said: 'The smell is your flesh being eaten, it's just a smell that I can't describe. I went back to theatre and I had to have the inside of my breast cut away.' 

Sue's husband Steve has remained supportive but he understands that she has lost a lot of her confidence after her surgery. 

He said: 'You try to tell her that everything's alright, everything's fine, don't be worried about it. She feels odd, to me she wasn't, she was still the same'

Six months after her initial operation Sue went back under the knife to try and rectify the damage but was horrified when she realised the new implant was the wrong size. 

'When I went back to have it checked they realised that they had put the wrong sized implant in, it wasn't big enough,' Sue lamented. 

'My body is worse now than it's ever been and I was just told by the consultant that there was nothing else that could be done - that they'd come to the end of the road.

'I can't look at myself in the mirror. I've got no confidence at all I don't like anybody seeing me, not even my husband. I don't like my husband to see me undressed. I don't feel like a woman any more I just feel like some kind of alien.'
