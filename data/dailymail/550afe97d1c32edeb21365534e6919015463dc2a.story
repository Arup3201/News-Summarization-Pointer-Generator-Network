Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi has become 'Super Morsi' in a spoof of eighties classic game Super Mario Brothers.

The leader's face has been cut out and superimposed on a tiny figure in the platform game.

The 30-second clip has gone viral among the Egyptian community as Super Morsi battles against his opponents.

The orange body bounces around the purple screen gaining points as he battles past opponents.

Competitors to make an appearance include former presidential candidates such as Mohamed el-Baradei, leader of the Constitution party.

After getting past these opponents, Super Morsi comes across an unexpected lifeline – the Muslim Brotherhood's Supreme Guide, Mohammed Badie, reports Al Arabiya.

But the video finishes with an alternative to the traditional endgame words 'Game Over.'

Instead 'Thawra Over' appears on a black game screen - Thawra means revolution in Arabic.

The game brought a rare moment of light-hearted expression of dissidence amid Egypt's political turmoil that has left dozens dead and hundreds injured in recent months.

Morsi, was sworn into office in June 2012 as the fifth president of Egypt - the first Islamist to hold the job.

Since he came to power he has been the target of online jokes - last week hundreds of protesters gathered at his staff headquarters performed the latest viral dance craze - the Harlem Shake.

About 400 young men, some in funny 
costumes and others bare-chested, rallied in Cairo in front of the main 
office of Morsi's group, The Muslim Brotherhood.

The flash mob danced in protest at country's most powerful Islamic group while chanting "Leave! Leave!" to President Morsi.

Last month an Egyptian opposition group used a novel way to protest against President Morsi - they signed him up for a chance to win a trip to space.

The April 6 Youth Movement said on its official Facebook page that it had entered the Islamist leader's name in the online contest because it wanted to be rid of him.

It called on supporters to vote for the president so he'd have a chance to win the trip into space.

April 6 was a driving force behind the 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak's regime.

Many of its supporters backed Morsi in the June 2012 election he narrowly won to become Egypt's first freely elected president.

But later, the group became among the fiercest critics of the president and his Muslim Brotherhood, the fundamentalist group from which he hails.

The opposition accuses Morsi of monopolizing power and going back on campaign promises to have an inclusive government and introduce far reaching reforms.

Morsi's supporters say the new government cannot immediately fix years of neglect and poor administration from Mubarak's 29-year rule.
