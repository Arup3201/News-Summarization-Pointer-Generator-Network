Divorce battle: Former City trader Yan Assoun (above) outside London's appeal court where he claimed he was 'bust' despite being a major shareholder of £5m-a-year business

A former City trader locked in a bitter divorce battle today told a judge that he was not 'rich' despite being a major shareholder of a £5million-a-year business and owning a £2million apartment.

Yan Assoun, 43 - whose spending power was described by a family judge just three months ago as 'beyond the wildest dreams' of his estranged wife - insisted in London's Appeal Court that he was 'bust'.

Mr Assoun, who is believed to be French, said he was labouring under enormous debts, adding: 'Yes I own a $3.3m (£2million) apartment - it doesn’t mean I'm rich.'

Mr Assoun and his ex-wife Anais Assoun, 44, met and married in London while he worked in the City for BNP Paribas and Credit Suisse.

They raised their two children - Graysha, now a model, and Kai - in the capital before splitting in 2007 and departing for different parts of the US in 2009.

However Mrs Assoun, a fashion writer who owns a ranch in Texas, and her ex-husband, whose home is a $3.3million (£2million) condo in one of New York’s most iconic areas, turned to the English courts to decide how the family wealth should be divided.

Mr Assoun told Lord Justice Moses that despite his ex-wife being awarded $1.1m worth of assets in 2011 - in addition to him being ordered to pay her $180,000-a-year in maintenance, plus $50,000-a-year to pay for their children’s education - the financial battle between the couple is far from over.

A final court show-down to assess and divide their wealth is pending and, in July, Judge Glenn Brasse ordered that Mr Assoun pay £235,000 towards his ex-wife’s legal costs bills in the run-up to that hearing.

The banker asked Lord Justice Moses to overturn that order, telling him: 'My recent income has dropped considerably - I don’t have any money.'

Judge Brasse, sitting at the Clerkenwell and Shoreditch County Court in July, awarded the payment towards the wife’s costs, after ruling on a dispute between the former spouses over the amount of personal wealth each of them controls.

Protracted dispute: Mr Assoun's ex-wife Anais Assoun, right, with their model daughter Graysha

In his ruling, the judge said of Mr Assoun: 'The husband has been able to acquire a $3.3m apartment in Manhattan. This kind of spending ability is not within the wife’s reach, not within her wildest dreams.'

Of Mrs Assoun, he added: 'She is a well-educated woman, with a first and masters degree and journalistic experience,' going on to say that her earning capacity was far outweighed by that of her husband.

Mr Assoun, representing himself, told the Appeal Court: 'Judge Brasse ordered me to pay large sums in legal fees to my wife...(he was) wrong to make such an order'.

Of his multi-million dollar business he added: 'Speculation that a turnover of $8m would automatically translate to a large income for myself, because I own 50% of the company, is just wrong.

'He is making a mistake... I am currently acting in person because my recent income has dropped considerably. I can no longer afford a solicitor...what is in the past is almost irrelevant.'

Mrs Assoun was awarded $1.1m worth of assets in 2011 in addition to $180,000-a-year in maintenance plus $50,000-a-year for their children's education

Putting a question to Mr Assoun on the current state of his business, Lord Justice Moses asked: 'Did your barrister say it’s all gone bust?'

'Yes he did,' the banker replied, adding: 'The house has no equity - the house belongs to the banks. I own an apartment worth $3.3m - it doesn’t mean I’m rich.'

Insisting that the £235,000 costs payment was effectively an 'increase in maintenance' for his ex-wife, he concluded: 'The point is, I don’t have this money.'

'It is far above my income. I don’t have any capacity for borrowing. I already have a huge amount of debt. I don’t have any money.'

Lord Justice Moses, however, said, 'The judge didn’t believe that and thought you were much better off. The Court of Appeal cannot disturb the findings as to who is believed and who is not'.

Before Judge Brasse 'the parties financial positions were very much in dispute,' but Mr Assoun now insisted 'that he is much worse off than the judge believed.'

Turning to his financial situation, Lord Justice Moses said: 'You are the majority shareholder and you set the company up.

'When the judge says you have an apartment in Manhatten worth $3.3m, and a company with a recent turnover of $8m, he is saying that the company could afford to pay you more. He is saying you could afford to pay yourself more.'

Refusing permission to appeal, he added: 'The judge in my view was entitled to take the view that Mr Assoun...was prosperous and would have sufficient finances to provide not only for his own, but also for his wife’s, legal expenses.

'There may be arguments to be made as to the comparative means of the parties, but it seems to me that the most disruptive thing would be the postponement of the (pending) Family Court hearing.

'The forthcoming hearing provides the best opportunity for the truth as to the husband and wife’s comparative assets to be revealed.

'If it should turn out that this man does not have £250,000 to pay the sum ordered, then the wife will have to give credit for that and it would count heavily against her. Woe betide the wife if the basis upon which she obtained this substantial order turns out to be false,' he concluded.

Mrs Assoun did not attend the Appeal Court hearing and was not represented.
