Two people taken in a jewellery store in Montpellier, southern France, have been released after being held hostage for eight hours. 

The suspect reportedly held the hostages at gunpoint when special police forces, along with the region’s prosecutor and the city mayor, arrived on the scene and the area was surrounded. 

People from the surrounding shops were evacuated by police and the electricity was cut briefly to prepare them for the attack. The suspect gave himself up in the early hours this morning. 

The  hostages were reportedly two women - a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old - who work in the shop, according to Russian broadcaster RT.

It is reported that nearly 100 police officers were involved in the operation. 

Montpellier prosecutor Christophe Barret said: 'This man entered the jewellery store but there was no attempted robbery and his motive is not known.'

Authorities did not provide explanations as to the gunman's motives, but said it had 'no connection' with the recent terrorist attacks in Paris.

The siege happened just hours after the Charlie Hebdo suspects were killed and the siege on a kosher store in east Paris, which left four hostages dead and the gunman being killed.
