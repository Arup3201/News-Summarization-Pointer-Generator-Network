Wojciech Szczesny, Tomas Rosicky and Lukas Podolski have proven themselves to be talented players on the pitch, but the Arsenal trio have shown they possess talents off the field as well.

Decked out in the obligatory Christmas jumpers, the three Gunners banded together to make a festive video ahead of the club's dedicated charity matchday on Saturday.

Szczesny showcased his keyboard talents along while Podolski demonstrated some percussion skills but Rosicky is the band's undisputed star.
