Emperor penguins maintain the tight huddle that protects them from the harsh conditions of an Antarctic winter with stop-and-go movements like cars in a traffic jam, a new study has shown.

German researchers said an individual penguin only needs to move a mere two centimetres in any direction for its huddling neighbour to react and also make a small step to stay close to it.

These tiny movements then flow through the entire group - which includes thousands of penguins - like a wave.

The Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species and is endemic to Antarctica.

The male and female are similar in plumage and size, reaching 48inches (122cm) in height and weighing anywhere from 49 to 99lbs (22 to 45 kg).

Like all penguins the Emperor is flightless, but has a streamlined body and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat.

Its diet consists primarily of fish, but can also include crustaceans, such as krill, and cephalopods, such as squid.

In hunting, the species can remain submerged for up to 18 minutes, diving to a depth of 1,755 ft (535m).

It has several adaptations to facilitate this, including an unusually structured hemoglobin to allow it to function at low oxygen levels, solid bones to reduce barotrauma and the ability to reduce its metabolism and shut down non-essential organ functions.

The Emperor is the only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic winter,

It treks 31–75 miles (50–120 km) over the ice to breeding colonies which may include thousands of individuals.

Their lifespan is typically 20 years in the wild, although observations suggest that some individuals may live to 50 years of age.

The stop-and-go motion plays a vital role in keeping the huddle as dense as possible to protect the penguins from the cold, while the wave also helps smaller huddles merge into larger ones.

Researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), in Bremerhaven, Germany, used a mathematical model to recreate the positions, movements and interactions of individual penguins in a huddle.

In a previous study, the same group of researchers studied time-lapse videos and showed that instead of remaining static, penguins in a huddle actually move every 30 to 60 seconds, causing surrounding penguins to move with them.

Daniel Zitterbart, co-author of the 
study, which is published in the Institute of Physics and German 
Physical Society’s New Journal of Physics, said: ‘Our previous study 
showed how penguins use travelling waves to allow movement in a densely 
packed huddle, but we had no explanation as to how these waves propagate
 and how they are triggered.’

German researchers said an individual penguin only needs to move a mere two centimetres in any direction for its huddling neighbour to react and also make a small step to stay close to it. This is a screenshot of the animation showing the stop-and-go movement of the penguins

To investigate this, the researchers used a mathematical model, which has previously been used to study traffic jams and compared the results with an analysis of video recordings of a real-life penguin huddle.

Unlike a traffic jam, the researchers found that the waves of movements in a penguin huddle can originate from any single penguin and can propagate in any direction as soon as a sufficient gap, known as a ‘threshold distance’ develops between two penguins.

To cope with the harsh conditions, the male penguins form dense huddles, often consisting of thousands of individuals, to maintain their body temperatures

This threshold distance was estimated to be around two cm, which is twice the thickness of a penguin’s compressive feather layer, suggesting the penguins touch each other only slightly when standing in a huddle without compressing the feather layer so they maximise huddle density without compromising their own insulation and warmth.

‘We were really surprised that a travelling wave can be triggered by any penguin in a huddle, rather than penguins on the outside trying to push in,’ said Dr Zitterbart.

‘We also found it amazing how two waves, if triggered shortly after each other, merged instead of passing one another, making sure the huddle remains compact.’

The stop-and-go motion of the penguins plays a vital role in keeping the huddle as dense as possible to protect the penguins from the cold, while the wave (illustrated in a computer model) also helps smaller huddles merge into larger ones

The Emperor penguin is the only vertebrate species that breeds during the severe conditions of the Antarctic winter.

At this time of year temperatures can get as low as -50°C and winds can reach speeds of up to 200 kmp.

To cope with the harsh conditions, the male penguins form dense huddles, often consisting of thousands of individuals, to maintain their body temperatures.

Unlike other species of penguin, the male emperors are solely responsible for incubating their single egg during the winter, covering it in an abdominal pouch above their feet while the female returns to sea to feed.
