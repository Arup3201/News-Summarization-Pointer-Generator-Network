Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP, today visited the poppies installation at the Tower of London - ignoring pleas from officials for people to stay away because of the problem managing large crowds. 

More than four million people have already visited the memorial and large crowds are a common sight. 

On Friday the tens of thousands of people trying to get a glimpse of the river of poppies prompted officials to issue a warning for people to stay away because they were concerned  about crushes. 

Today Mr Farage was seen visiting the memorial and appeared to be wiping a tear from his eye after seeing the hundreds of thousands of ceramic poppies, planted in the Tower of London's moat to honour the war dead.  

By November 11, Armistice Day, there will be 888,246 ceramic poppies in the Tower of London’s moat – one for each of the British and Colonial soldiers, sailors and airmen who perished in the World War One.

The installation, named Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red has been created by artist Paul Cummins.
