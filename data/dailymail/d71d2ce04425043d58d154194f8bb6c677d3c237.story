Men who have the snip increase their risk of suffering fatal prostate cancer, according to research.

A study by Harvard scientists has found that those who have undergone a vasectomy could be 10 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with the disease.

The research – the largest ever examination of the link between vasectomy and prostate cancer – involved data from 50,000 men whose health was tracked for 24 years.

It found men who had the procedure were at an increased risk of getting an advanced or lethal form of the disease.

A study by scientists at Havard University found having a vasectomy - a common form of contraception - is linked to a 10 per cent increased risk of developing the most lethal form of prostate cancer

Vasectomy is a common form of contraception and is more popular in Britain than almost anywhere else in the world.

Some
 16 per cent of British men under 70 have had the operation. Prostate 
cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among men.

The 
researchers, whose work was published in the Journal of Clinical 
Oncology, analysed the health records of 49,405 American men who were 
followed between 1986 and 2010.

During that time, 6,023 cases of 
prostate cancer were diagnosed, including 811 lethal cases. One in four 
of the men in the study reported having a vasectomy.

The researchers 
found the men who had a vasectomy had a particularly raised risk of 
developing the most aggressive forms of prostate cancer which are most 
likely to kill.

They had a 20 per cent raised risk of getting an advanced form of the disease and a 19 per cent raised risk of dying.

The
 authors emphasised that their study had only established a statistical 
link between the operation and the disease – and they did not suggest 
that vasectomies were directly causing the cancer.

They concluded, 
however, that urgent investigation was needed to establish if and why 
the surgical procedure might be increasing the numbers of those with 
cancer. They wrote: ‘The findings of this study warrant continued 
epidemiologic and experimental research into clarifying the association 
of vasectomy with prostate cancer.’

Author Kathryn Wilson said: ‘The
 decision to opt for a vasectomy as a form of birth control is a highly 
personal one and a man should discuss the risks and benefits with his 
physician.’

Co-author Lorelei Mucci, associate professor of epidemiology
 at Harvard School of Public Health, added: ‘The results support the 
hypothesis that vasectomy is associated with an increased risk of 
advanced or lethal prostate cancer.’

But he pointed out that 
although the results are statistically significant, in terms of absolute
 risk the figures are low. Just 16 out of every 1,000 men in the study 
died from prostate cancer over a 24-year period.

A vasectomy is 
considered a safe operation, but, even disregarding the new findings, 
there are risks associated with the procedure.

They include 
infections, long term testicular pain, blood clots in the tissue 
surrounding the operated area and hematomas – painful lumps in the 
scrotum.

In a very small number of cases – around one in every 2,000 –
 the tubes that are cut during the vasectomy reconnect themselves, 
effectively reversing the procedure and making a man fertile again.

Apart
 from condoms, having a vasectomy is the only form of male 
contraceptive, a situation scientists have been trying to improve upon 
for decades.

Researchers are confident a hormonal contraceptive for 
men will be found in the next few years, most likely in the form of an 
oral tablet similar to the pill taken by women.

But a radical 
alternative route being considered by some scientists is a ‘chemical 
vasectomy’, which would use medication to stop sperm leaving the body 
during sex.
