Avatar star Sam Worthington has been arrested in New York after an altercation with a photographer.

The Australian actor, 37, reportedly attacked a paparazzo at the Cubbyhole bar in West Village after the photographer allegedly kicked his partner Lara Bingle, 26.

During the scuffle, Sam was said to have referred to Bingle as his 'wife', yelling at the photographer, 'you kicked my wife.'

However, a friend of Lara's told the MailOnline on Monday: ‘He would have been speaking figuratively. They are definitely not married, as far as I know.’

Several reports earlier this year suggested that the couple had secretly married in Western Australia ahead of a romantic trip to the Maldives.

They have since been seen wearing matching rings on their wedding fingers.

New York Police Department Lieutenant John Grimpel confirmed Worthington's arrest on Monday.

Grimpel told the Daily Telegraph: 'It happened at 5.30pm this evening.

'The photographer kicked Lara and then Worthington punched him causing the photographer to have lacerations to his nose.

'He has been charged with assault. He punched the photographer.'

Eyewitnesses saw the Aussie actor being bundled into a police car following the incident.

Worthington was released on bail after being charged and will appear in court on February 26.

The photographer involved in the scuffle has been arrested and charged with assault, reckless endangerment and harassment. 

MailOnline have contacted both Bingle's and Worthington's spokespeople for a comment.

This is Worthington’s second run-in with a photographer - he was arrested and pepper sprayed in Atlanta in 2012, following an argument outside of a restaurant.

Worthington and his Australian model girlfriend have been in New York since the beginning of Fashion Week where they attended a number of shows together.

They were photographed strolling hand-in-hand through the city on Friday looking very much in love with the pretty blonde smiling widely as she paused to gaze into her Avatar beau’s eyes.

The 26-year-old, last week told social media followers that she hopes to relocate to the Big Apple permanently saying she was in NYC and 'here to stay!'

Did Sam put a ring on it? Lara was photographed in Sydney on January 22 wearing a gold band on her ring finger after the couple were in Western Australia

A spokesperson later confirmed to MailOnline that she is looking to spend more time there.

Last month the Cotton On Body designer told Woman's Day magazine that she wasn't happy living in Australia because she and Worthington 'don't get any peace'.

'Sydney's my home but I don't like it,' she said.

'I can't even go to the supermarket without getting papped (snapped by paparazzi). I don't like the attention.'

Social media fan: Lara often posts snaps of her and Sam together on her Instagram page, like this one on Valentine's Day
