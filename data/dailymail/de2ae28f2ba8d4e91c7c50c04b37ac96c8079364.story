Jail: Adam Matos, 28, was arrested September 5, 2014 outside a Tampa hotel as a suspect in the killings of four people whose bodies were found stacked on the ground and decomposing

The suspect in the Florida deaths of his ex-girlfriend, her new boyfriend and her parents said in a jailhouse interview that he is innocent. 

Adam Matos, 28, told The Tampa Bay Times he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time in an interview from the Pasco County Jail in Florida.

He said: 'Everybody's looking at me like I did it. All the fingers point to me, you know? So I'm not going to change anybody's beliefs.'  

Matos was arrested on September 5 at a Tampa Bay area hotel with his four-year-old autistic son, Ismael Tristan Santisteban. 

The bodies of the child's mother, Megan Brown, her parents, Margaret and Greg Brown and her new boyfriend, Nicholas Leonard, were found on top of a hill in Pasco County. 

The child was missing for a day before he was found safe in Tampa with Matos.

He is currently being held on a separate aggravated assault charge. The child is with family.

In the interview from jail, Matos told the Times that his son is 'the sweetest kid you'll ever know.'

'I want the people to know that I didn't do it,' Matos said, 'and that I love my son very much.' 

He also contradicted a police report that he had threatened Megan Brown with a knife on August 28, which is the last day anyone had heard from her and said that didn't happen.

Instead, he said they had an argument over 'something stupid' and she asked him to leave.

He also offered up his own theory of what happened. 

He says a woman who possibly knew Leonard was stalking Brown. 

He said the woman, who he never saw and didn't know her name, had left Brown threatening letters and voicemails. 

He said that she was the one who had threatened Megan Brown at the family's home.

Matos told The Times that he had lived on the street for a few days after the argument with Megan Brown.

Found: Ismael Tristan Santisteban was found at a Tampa hotel after going missing with his father, who was wanted for the murders of four people

Killed: The body of  Nicholas Leonard, pictured here, was found on top of a hill in Pasco County

He wouldn't say how he got the child or where he was planning to go. He said at the advice of his attorney, a public defender, he couldn't divulge more.

Matos was born in Philadelphia and had lived in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and New York City. 

He said he met Brown six years ago and still loves her. 

He said he had shared responsibility of taking care of Tristan.

He left Pennsylvania with Brown and her family two months ago. They settled in Hudson. He said they broke up two weeks ago, but they ended the relationship on good terms.
