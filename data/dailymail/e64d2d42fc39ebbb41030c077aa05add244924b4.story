The Statue of Liberty is due to reopen for Fourth of July after Superstorm Sandy flooded the island where it stands.

The statue has been closed since Sandy struck the region on October 29 and damaged much of Liberty Island's infrastructure. The statue is on higher ground and was not damaged.

Ferry tickets to visit the island on July 4 or later may be purchased online or by phone. Tickets to the statue's crown are only available by reservation.

Beacon of hope: The Statue of Liberty has been closed since Sandy hit in October, but the iconic attraction is due to reopen on July 4

However, the Ellis Island Immigration Museum is not expected to reopen to the public this year. The museum sits on Ellis Island, next to the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.

New York Senator Charles E. Schumer said: 'July Fourth is the perfect day to reopen a symbol of our nation's freedom, and speaks volumes about New York's resilience.'

He added: 'Lady Liberty was hit hard by Superstorm Sandy, but just like New York, she will be back – and stronger than ever.'

Sandy brought water levels up to 8ft to the island, destroying boilers and electrical systems.

The Independence Day opening of the 
statue, which was presented to the U.S. by the French in 1886 and stands 
as a symbol of freedom and democracy, will be a beacon of hope to the 
recovery process.

More than six months after Sandy devastated New York City 
and the Jersey shore, and pounded coastal areas of New England, the 
region is dealing with a slow recovery.

Weather the storm: The statue was able to withstand the full force of Sandy but Liberty Island was damaged

Tens of thousands of people remain homeless. Housing, business, 
tourism and coastal protection all remain major issues with the summer 
vacation - and hurricane - seasons almost here again.

Although the statue is more than 125 years old, its iron framework was able to withstand the full force of Sandy, as it swept into New York last year.

However, the passenger docks, sidewalks, generator and power systems were all in need of repair.

Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said: 'We're going to get this done as soon as we possibly can because [the Statue of Liberty is] such an important icon for New York and America.'

Mr Salazar, who visited the damaged island in December, estimated that repairs to Ellis Island and Liberty Island may cost up to $59 million. 

The statue, which is a National Monument, and Liberty Island, are important assets to the City's tourism economy. 

In 2011, the National Park Service said that 3.7 million people visited the attraction, bringing in $174 million and supporting 2,218 jobs.
