A mesmerising video has emerged of a a man walking on a tightrope dressed in an LED suit.

In the footage, captured in Mortero de Astrana, Spain late last month, the man shows impressive balance as he makes his way along the rope in total darkness.

At the start of the clip, the man adjusts his position, and to the right of the shot, you can just make out the rock hosting the tightrope. 

The video is as much intriguing as it is mesmerising as the LED suit clashes brilliant with the darkness

There are a few hairy moments for the daredevil as he treks along the tightrope

His suit contrasts with the night sky, giving the appearance of a glowing stick-figure walking into space.

But if you look closely enough, you can just about make out his face.

Despite not actually knowing the height, or even the length of the stunt, this all adds to the intrigue of the mysterious video.

The LED suit makes the stuntman appear more like a stickman, and you can only just see his feet

The man's face appearing in the outfit looks almost photoshopped in
