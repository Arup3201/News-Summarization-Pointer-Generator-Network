More than 100 asylum seekers have been given rooms in a £125-a-night hotel that has hosted Premier League footballers.

The families will stay in the hotel until alternative accommodation is found – and the bill for the taxpayer could be as much as £300,000.

They are expected to remain at the 50-bedroom Amblehurst Hotel in Sale, which has hosted parties for Manchester United players, for at least nine weeks.

The migrants were booked in at the Amblehurst Hotel, Sale, while their claims to stay in the UK are dealt with

The local authority said it was given only 48 hours’ notice about the arrival of the 31 families – a total of 104 asylum seekers.

It criticised Serco, the private firm appointed by the Government to organise such accommodation, describing it as ‘incompetent’.

Councillor Matthew Colledge, leader of Tory-controlled Trafford Council in Greater Manchester, said the situation was ‘frankly ludicrous’, adding: ‘I have asked, along with partners from the NHS, for the decision to be deferred, but this is not to be.’

He expressed concern over the sudden strain that would be put on already stretched services, saying: ‘I recognise that some asylum seekers are escaping from appalling situations, and that may include the children arriving in Trafford.

'However, with schools and GP surgeries full in the Sale area I question the logic of choosing this location.’

More than 100 asylum seekers have been put up in this hotel for nine weeks costing the taxpayer £300,000

Councillor David Acton, leader of the Labour group, added:  ‘It seems to me that Serco are incompetent.

‘It is an absolute shambles and unacceptable.’

Taxpayers’ groups branded the hotel stay a colossal waste of money on an ‘expensive quick fix’.

A note on the hotel entrance states: ‘Dear all, please note the hotel is closed until further notice to all general public. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused.’

Nearby resident Ian Fanshawe, 49, said: ‘The hotel is fancy and must be costing a bit. It used to hold Manchester United parties there after the matches.’

The families had been housed in Liverpool before a huge influx of asylum seekers into the city.

The hotel bill, with food, could run to as much as £293,750.

Resident Gina McIntyre, 55, said: ‘What about all the local people who are homeless? They are  not put up in a plush hotel … at taxpayers’ expense.’

Serco said the families ‘will be found further housing throughout the North West of England’ pending the outcome of their asylum claims.

The hotel is said to have hosted parties for Manchester United football players in the past
