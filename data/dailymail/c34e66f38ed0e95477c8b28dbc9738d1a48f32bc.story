The White House excluded former president George W. Bush from the official photo of last Saturday's march through Selma to commemorate Bloody Sunday.

The original photo is a wide shot of crowds walking on Edmund Pettus Bridge led by Barack, Michelle, Malia and Sasha Obama, as well as Georgia Rep. John Lewis, Al Sharpton, Bush and his wife, former First Lady Laura.

However, in a move that incensed Republicans, the administration's blog post documenting the historic occasion omitted the former President, with a sharper, close up picture that showed only the Obamas and the crowds behind.

Cropped version: This is the image as it appeared on the White House blog, omitting the Bush family

While the caption acknowledges their attendance, many questioned the reasoned to whittle down the image.

The New York Times also ran the cropped image. 

'This is a stunning example of media bias,' raged Deneen Borelli, director of FreedomWorks and a regular Fox News contributor.

Analysts suggest it could have been a case of poor planning that saw the presidents separated

One Twitter user said: 'NYT creates propaganda to fit the narrative, and White House follows suit. Both pretend George Bush wasn't at Selma.'

Another said: 'Letting him be seen would destroy the liberal narrative.'

However, a public relations analyst who worked with the Clinton administration, Basil Smikle Jr, told Fox News poor planning could have been to blame.

He said: 'Both presidents should have been close together.'
