Alex Salmond's hopes of winning the referendum on Scottish independence have been dealt a blow by a new poll showing a slump in support for his cause among teenagers.

The SNP First Minister has been demanding that the 2014 vote should be extended to 16 and 17-year-olds –encouraged by research suggesting that younger age groups were more likely to be in favour of devolution.

However, a survey by The Mail on Sunday in Scotland found that the teens questioned – who will be 16 or 17 in 2014 – are overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the Union. 

'Slump': Lack of support for devolution among teens will be a disappointment to First Minister Alex Salmond, seen at a pro-independence rally in Edinburgh

According to the poll, only 26 per cent of them would back independence – even fewer than the 27 per cent rating recorded among adults in another recent survey by this newspaper. The SNP has long viewed young voters as a crucial part of its strategy to overturn decades-old resistance to independence from the majority of Scots voters.

Scottish Secretary Michael Moore will tomorrow hold talks with the SNP about plans for the referendum. Until now, the Government has been resistant to lowering the voting age – but the poll findings could persuade them to adopt a more flexible approach.

Polling expert Professor John Curtice said: ‘This shows the assumptions made by some that younger voters tend towards independence is some way out.

‘The crucial group are those over the age of 60, who are more inclined to vote. We may yet see a deal which extends the franchise for the referendum but we don’t know if the people in this category will turn up and vote, as turnout among younger voters is traditionally low.’

An SNP spokesman said: ‘The SNP will engage positively with our young people ahead of the referendum as we have a positive message to communicate.’
