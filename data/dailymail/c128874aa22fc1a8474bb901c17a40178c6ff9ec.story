Joan Rivers left her only child Melissa in charge of her estimated $150million fortune held in a trust.

The late comedian's will was filed in New York State Surrogate's Court on Tuesday and reveals she named her daughter as executor of the trust with 'the broadest and most absolute permissible direction to delegate the fortune to family, friends and charities. Rivers' business manager Michael D Karlin and interior designer Robert Higdon were named co-executors of the living trust.

The will also briefly mentions a potential malpractice lawsuit against the Manhattan clinic where Rivers slipped into a coma while undergoing a routine throat surgery in August.

She died on September 4, succumbing to brain damage and lack of oxygen.

Since Rivers' fortune is in a trust, it's unclear how much she designated to her surviving family members and friends, but daughter Melissa, grandson Edgar Cooper Endicott and her sister Barbara's children Caroline and Andrew Waxler are expected to receive inheritances.

Money will also be given to Rivers' assistants Jocelyn Pickett and Sabrina Lott Miller, and her former publicist Scott Currie.

The will also detailed that part of the fortune be donated to causes close to Rivers' heart including the charities Guide Dogs for the Blind in California, Queens food pantry God's Love We Deliver, the Jewish Guild for the Blind, Simon Wisenthal Center, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the Jewish Home and Hospital Foundation.

Melissa Rivers is expected to speak about her late mother at the Hollywood Reporter's Women in Entertainment Breakfast on Wednesday in Los Angeles.

Comedian Sarah Silver will also pay tribute to the funny lady at the event.

The breakfast will mark the first time Melissa will speak at length about her mother since her passing on September 4. Melissa is expected to pursue a malpractice suit against the clinic which allegedly caused her mothers death, Yorkville Endoscopy.

A state report says the clinic Rivers visited failed to identify her deteriorating vital signs during the routine procedure.
