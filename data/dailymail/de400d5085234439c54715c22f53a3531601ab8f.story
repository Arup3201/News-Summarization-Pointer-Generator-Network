The more prolific use of medical marijuana has seen a dramatic increase in the number of 'stoned' dogs being treated, according to vets.

Several pets have died after mistakenly eating food laced with the drug which is legally sold across the U.S. to relieve the pain of chronic illnesses. 

Vets have said they are now seeing cases of dogs poisoned by marijuana several times a week instead of a few times a year in states where the substance has been legalized.

No new tricks: A dog is treated at the vet's clinic in Colorado after legalization of medical marijuana has seen users' pets become sick

Dr Debbie Van Pelt, a vet from Englewood, Colorado, where the drug is legal, told CBS: 'They basically have lost a lot of their fine motor control, they have a wide-based stance and they are not sure on their feet.'

Most dogs survive despite becoming sick from being around the product but if it is ingested in a product like brownies or cookies, it can be fatal.

Vets said two dogs have died after eating food containing marijuana butter which seems to be more toxic. Labradors are most at risk, according to animal experts, because 'they'll eat anything'.

Symptoms in animals include staggering, acting sleepy, vomiting and being overly sensitive to sound and light.

In November 2000, medical marijuana was legalized in Colorado with around 100,000 people currently registered to use it.

Some 68 per cent of applicants who use the drug are male and the average age is 41 years old.
