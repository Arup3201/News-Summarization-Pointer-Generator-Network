Most Chancellors are accused of disappearing from public gaze, particularly when the economy takes a turn for the worst.

George Osborne has admitted retreating to the Treasury last year in the wake of his disastrous ‘pasty tax’ Budget which unravelled within hours.

But as the economy has picked up this year he has been determined to be seen helping every sector of the economy – especially manufacturers of hi-vis jackets.

United colours of Osborne: 2013 was the year when George Osborne went out of his way to be seen

A year ago Mr Osborne decided that he would use 2013 to ‘get out there’ and explain what he was doing to boost the economy.

But having had a relatively low media profile, he needed to do something to ensure he was visible to the public.

So
 from factories to bakeries, oil platforms in the North Sea to coal 
mines in Nottinghamshire, the Chancellor has been donned the bright 
yellow and orange outfits beloved of the health and safety police to 
meet the ‘important people’ who make Britain tick.

His
 rising political stock has coincided with the recovery gaining 
momentum, with the economy now expected to grow by the Office for Budget Responsibility by 1.4 per 
cent this year, up from 0.6 per cent forecast in May.

January: George Osborne was feeling blue as 2013 got underway and he toured factory of train wheel manufacturers Lucchini UK in  Manchester

February: Mr Osborne donned a a high-vis vest to admire machinery at Prysmian Group while campaigning for Tory candidate Maria Hutchings in the Eastleigh by-election

February: Mr Osborne did not always look like he was enjoying himself in Eastleigh as he campaigned for the Conservatives

Mr Osborne has admitted that the hi-vis visits have been part of a deliberate drive to raise his profile.

He
 said: ‘Last year when the economic situation was difficult, when the 
budget had not been well-received, I got into that situation which I 
think happens to politicians which is “I am going to get on with the 
job, if people don’t want to hear an explanation of what I am doing , so
 be it, I am just going to stick at it”.

‘Towards
 the end of last year I realised that you cannot do that if you are 
doing my job. You have got to get out there and explain what you are 
doing and why you are doing it, why you think it is the right thing for 
the country,’ he told Channel 4 News during the Tory party conference.'

March: The day after delivering his Budget statement in the Commons, the Chancellor joined Chairman of Berkeley Group Tony Pidgley (left) and Mike Woolliscroft(right), project director for Berkeley Group, on a visit to a housing development in  Woolwich

March: Mr Osborne did his best to look relaxed while chatting with workmen

May: As the economy showed signs of recovery, Mr Osborne's love of hi-vis went international as he invited  India's Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram, (right), to tour the Pudding Mill Lane Crossrail construction site, in east London

May: Pressure was still on Mr Osborne in the spring, with the International Monetary Fund insisting Britain could do more to deliver growth

May: A visit to the Port Of Liverpool during a visit to mark the start of dredging of the River Mersey Estuary saw orange and yellow hi-vis worn together

Mr Osborne went on: ‘I
 have got out of the Treasury a bit more over the last few months and 
tried to consciously go around the country, meet working people, go to 
lots of work places and the like.

‘Because I think it is an obligation on someone doing my job, with the responsibilities I have, to explaining what I am doing.

‘It
 is probably true to say that last year I retreated a bit into the 
Treasury but now I feel I have got a very important message to take to 
the people about what we are doing on the economy, and I have got a very
 important set of people I need to listen to which is the people of this
 country.’

July: During his overnight shift meeting workers, Mr Osborne wore matching hi-vis jacket and trousers to admire the tarmac being laid on a section of the M6 motorway near Birmingham

July: Workers lined up to shake the Chancellor's hand in the middle of the night

July: Mr Osborne said he wanted to thank the people who work around the clock to keep the economy on track

July: Mr Osborne said the economy was picking up as he had a go on a forklift truck at Tesco's National Distribution Centre near Rugby

July: Mr Osborne said he wanted to put night workers in the spotlight

July: A lorry driver chats with the Chancellor outside Warburtons Bakery in Wednesbury near Birmingham

It began in 
January with a low profile visit to tour the factory of train wheel 
manufacturers Lucchini UK in Manchester, where his blue vest would be 
best described as ‘low-vis’.

On
 the campaign trail during the Eastleigh by-election he wore orange, 
before donning yellow to tour a building site the day after this year’s 
better-received Budget.

In July Mr Osborne’s commitment to hi-vis peaked when he spent a shift visiting night workers across the Midlands.

September: A green hard that was teamed with an orange hi-vis boiler suit for a visit to the Montrose Platform in the North Sea

September: Mr Osborne used the visit to pay pay tribute to the victims of the North Sea helicopter crash

September: The Chancellor says he has used visits like this to listen to ordinary people across the country

He
 watched bread coming off the production line at Warburtons, sat in a 
forklift truck, met workers laying tarmac on the M6 and chatted with 
lorry drivers.

In September he teamed a bright green hard hat with an orange boiler suit to visit the Montrose Platform in the North Sea.

And
 last month Mr Osborne debuted a hi-vis orange t-shirt and shin guards 
during a visit to Thoresby Colliery in Nottinghamshire.

November: Touring Thoresby Colliery in Nottinghamshire, Mr Osborne met miner Dave Hawells, who bore an uncanny similarity to U2 frontman Bono

November: In addition to a yellow hard hat, and hi-vis jacket and trousers, Mr Osborne also wore hi-vis shin guards and later a hi-vis t-shirt

November: Mr Osborne was given a tour of the mineshaft, as he announced he was protecting a fund which gives ex-miners free coal

Earlier this month Mr Osborne was vindicated in thinking the economy had turned the corner, when the Office for Budget Responsibility more than doubled its growth forecasts for 2013.

It now expects the economy to expand by 1.4 per cent, up from 0.6 per cent predicted in March.

Mr Osborne confidently told the Commons that ‘Britain is moving again’.

And the next day he celebrated by pulling on a bright yellow vest to visit a JCB factory in Staffordshire.

December: Mr Osborne uses a stud gun during his visit to JCB's backhoe loader factory

December: He tried his hand at operating some of the machinery at the factory in Rocester, Staffordshire, although his hi-vis green vest clashed with the yellow JCB cab

Power tool: Mr Osborne appears pleased that a year of wearing hi-vis has proved to voters that he is a man who means business
