Arrest: Mariano Abete is the son of Mafia super-boss Archangel Abete

A baby-faced mafia don thought to be one of Italy's youngest-ever gang bosses has been captured by police in Italy.

Mariano Abete, 21, who is nicknamed 'baby-boss' in the Italian media, was arrested hiding in a secret room concealed behind a remote-controlled wall at his mother's house.

He had been leading the family in a turf war between rival factions of the Neapolitan Camorra which has already claimed dozens of lives.  

Abete had taken the helm after his 
father was arrested and his uncle murdered, and was wanted by police for
mafia association and conspiracy to sell drugs.

Despite his age, he was said to be powerful and dangerous.

Police swooped on the the house in Naples in the early hours of Saturday before closing in on his hiding place.

But
as they began to break through the wall his terrified mother, herself 
aged only 39, is said to have intervened, begging: 'Please don't hurt 
him, I'll open it.'

Video of
his hiding place, a minute cell hidden between two walls accessible 
only by a moveable wall operated by remote control, was last night 
circulating on the web.

The narrow cavity contained only a mattress, a pillow, a crucifix and a cannister of oxygen.

'Powerful and dangerous': Twenty-one-year-old crime boss Abete is led away by police after being arrested hiding at his mother's house on suspicion of mafia association and conspiracy to sell drugs

Abete
is considered mafia royalty, being the son of the super-boss Archangel 
Abete, so-called because he led a splinter group rebellion against the 
ruling family.

He is also the nephew of another notorious mafia don killed in an ambush in September in a suspected revenge attack for the murder of a notorious mafioso known as  'Wooden Hands'.

The nickname derived from the fact that he wore prosthetics after losing his hands a decade ago when a home-made bomb exploded.

The hit was the latest murder in the vicious gang war being waged for control of drug trafficking in the Naples districts of Scampia and Secondigliano.
