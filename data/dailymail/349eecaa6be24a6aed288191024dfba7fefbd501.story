Denise Van Outen will cycle 250 miles across Vietnam and Cambodia in January

She was one of the original ladettes, but now Denise Van Outen is a poster girl for charity sporting challenges. 

The former Big Breakfast presenter has signed up for an epic eight-day 250-mile cycle ride across Vietnam and Cambodia in January to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital.

It’s just the latest in a string of hard slogs. Denise has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and trekked the Great Wall of China, and in 2012 completed a 180-mile cycle ride across India to help the hospital.

She will be accompanied on the latest challenge by TV friends Lydia Bright from The Only Way Is Essex and Zoe Hardman from Take Me Out, and their publicist friend Kirsty Williams.

The friends are putting the training hours in on country roads – often around Essex – most weekends, and taking indoor spinning classes.

They’ve also been experimenting with foods to eat on the bike, such as flapjacks and energy bars. 

As a result Denise, who recently turned 40, says she is now fitter than she was in her 20s.

Drinking in moderation does not cause a beer belly

Refreshing news for beer lovers – drinking in moderation does not lead to a beer belly. 

In a study, more than 2,000 participants were given a ‘food frequency’ questionnaire and asked to list their intake of foods and beverages in an average week.

The researchers also measured their waist and hips and found that there was no significant correlation between moderate intake of beer (just over a pint a day for men or half a pint for women) and higher waist circumference. 

‘The conclusion is that beer seems to play no role in the so-called beer belly,’ says Dr Corina Zugravu of Bucharest University, where the study was carried out. 

‘It may just be a scapegoat for men who put on weight, which is often due to eating fatty foods and low exercise levels.’

The World Health Organisation recommends a waist circumference under 37in for men and 31in for women.

Poor oral hygiene could be a sign of infertility in men. 

Researchers measured the mouth hygiene of 76 men, 50 of whom had low sperm counts. 

They found that 80 per cent of the 50 also had poor oral health. The men with good oral hygiene were more likely to have a normal sperm count.

The team of dentists and fertility experts, writing in the Journal Of Contemporary Dental Practice, say it is evidence of the wider physiological effects of oral hygiene. 

Other research has suggested that gum disease in pregnant women could be a risk factor for premature birth and low birth weight. One theory is that oral bacteria get into the circulation.
