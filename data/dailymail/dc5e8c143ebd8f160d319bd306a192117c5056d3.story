Rio Ferdinand says he would have stayed on at Manchester United after Ryan Giggs made it clear he wanted to keep him at the club.

Giggs - in caretaker charge of United following the sacking of David Moyes at the end of last season - told Ferdinand he wanted him to sign a new deal at Old Trafford, should he remain at the helm.

But the impending arrival of Louis van Gaal saw Giggs handed the assistant manager’s role and Ferdinand was released by the club at the end of the season.

The 35-year-old signed for Queens Park Rangers earlier this month, but says he would have remained at United under Giggs.

‘When he (Giggs) took over he made it clear I would have stayed and been part of his plans,’ he said at his R’s unveiling on Monday.

‘But in football things change quickly and the new manager came in and things went a different way.’

He added: ‘(Would you have stayed?) I made it clear (I would) but at the end of the season they told me I was leaving the club and that happens in football.

‘I’m just happy to be here now. I started my career with Harry Redknapp at West Ham and to finish my career with him is a fairytale.’
