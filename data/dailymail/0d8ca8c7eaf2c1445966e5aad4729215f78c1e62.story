When a baby is screaming for food in the middle of the night the two minutes it takes to boil water to heat the bottle can seem like a lifetime.

A pair of entrepreneurs is hoping to make this easier by launching a kettle with a 'baby bottle preparation' function. 

It lets parents schedule when the kettle should start boiling, which also also gives it time to cool down, to coincide with the expected feeding times.

AppKettle was created by Loughborough University engineering graduates Robert Hill and Richard Hill. It is expected to launch on Kickstarter on 31 March and connects the smart kettle to an app to schedule boils

Alternatively, a parent can set the kettle to boil as soon as the baby starts crying so by the time they have got the infant out of bed and into the kitchen, the water is ready.

And AppKettle wasn't just designed for new parents, it can also be used to schedule the kettle to be boiled before a user gets home or first thing in the morning, for example.

Elsewhere, a connected app will reveal how much water is in the kettle so people know how many cups they can make, and this can ultimately save energy because kettles aren't boiled too often unnecessarily.

AppKettle can additionally control the temperature of the beverage, depending on the type of drink being made, or control the timing of the brew. Elsewhere, a connected app will reveal how much water is in the kettle so people know how many cups they can make, and this can ultimately save energy from excess boils

The first 250 backers of Appkettle will be able to pre-order it for £79.99 ($119), although the aim is to eventually set a retail price of around £120 ($179)

This follows a MailOnline story which found that for standard black tea, freshly boiled water should be used - with temperatures above 95°C (203°F).

Water should be left to cool down for at least 30 seconds when making green and white tea, with a recommended temperature of 74°C to 85°C (160°F to 203°F). 

Oolong tea is best steeped in 85°C (185°F) water, and herbal teas should be steeped in water with a temperature of 95°C (203°F).

And regardless of the temperature, tea should be steeped for six minutes for the perfect brew, according to the British Standards Institute.  

AppKettle was created by engineering graduates Robert Hill and Richard Hill. 

They showcased the technology at the recent Venturefest innovation exhibition in York and are now preparing to launch the Appkettle on Kickstater on 31 March.

Robert Hill from Coulby Newham, said: 'We see the Appkettle as a multi-functional piece of equipment that is unlike anything else on the market. 

It's early days but we've been in discussions with a number of worldwide brands, including an international domestic appliance brand.

'The crowdfunding launch will allow us to gauge interest but as every day goes by, I'm more and more confident that we have a product that will be successful.    

According to the British Standards Institute (BSI) guidelines for making the perfect cup of tea, the milk should be put in the cup first, the pot must be made of porcelain, there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml and the water must not exceed 85°C (185°F) when served

According to the British Standards Institute (BSI) guidelines the milk should be put in the cup first, the pot must be made of porcelain, there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml and the water must not exceed 85°C (185°F) when served.

And these guidelines explained that black tea should be steeped for at six minutes.

Steeping tea is the process of soaking a solid - in this case tea leaves - to extract flavours and soften it. 

For standard black tea, freshly boiled water should be used - with temperatures above 95°C (203°F).  

Water should be left to cool down for at least 30 seconds when making green and white tea, with a recommended temperature of 74°C to 85°C (160°F to 203°F). 

Oolong tea is best steeped in 85°C (185°F) water. 

Herbal teas should be steeped in water with a temperature of 95°C (203°F).  

On average, a teabag weighs 2g but contains around 1.5g of tea leaves, so at least two bags should be used for a small pot of tea and at least four should be used for a larger pot. 

When made with milk, the tea should be made and brewed in the same way and then added to milk in the cup.
