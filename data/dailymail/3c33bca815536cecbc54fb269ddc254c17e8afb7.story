Qantas has been named the world's safest airline, after a year when fatal air accidents soared above the 10-year average.

In a report published by AirlineRatings.com on Tuesday night, Qantas was lauded for amassing 'an extraordinary record of firsts' in safety and operations over its 94-year history.

The report comes after what was 'in no doubt' a bad year for airline safety, AirlineRatings.com said, adding 2014 included some of the industry's most tragic and bizarre incidents.

Qantas has been named the world's safest airline, after a year when fatal air accidents soared above the 10-year average

'Certainly, 21 fatal accidents with 986 fatalities - higher than the 10-year average - is sickening. However, the world's airlines carried a record 3.3 billion passengers on 27 million flights,' the report says.

AirlineRatings.com said the high number of deaths came despite the number of accidents for 2014 being at a record low 21 - one for every 1.3 million flights.

'Two of the crashes last year - MH370 and MH17 - were unprecedented in modern times and claimed 537 lives,' the report says.

'Flashback 50 years and there were a staggering 87 crashes killing 1,597 when airlines carried only 141 million passengers - five per cent of today's number.'
