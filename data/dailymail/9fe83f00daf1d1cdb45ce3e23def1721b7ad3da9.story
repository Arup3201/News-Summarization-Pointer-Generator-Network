With the Iowa caucuses just hours away, surprise dark horse Rick Santorum is picking up momentum - and plenty of cash - but the third-place candidate is also looking for help from a higher power.

The former Pennsylvania senator, who spent most of the fall and winter at the bottom of polls, surged last week and his campaign has 'raised more money in the last few days than the last few months’.

Mr Santorum, who has jumped into third place in the polls, is urging GOP voters to ‘send a shock wave across this country’ by voting for him and said the U.S. is searching for an inspirational leader.

The Republican presidential hopeful dismissed rival former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney's business experience, knowing many voters are flicking between the two ahead of Tuesday's vote.

But Mr Santorum is also taking a cue from the last Iowa winner Mike Huckabee - courting evangelical Christian voters that propelled him to victory in 2008 - in an effort to stop Mr Romney.

Mr Santorum has already picked up support from Christian leaders Bob Vander Plaats and Chuck Hurley, two strong social conservatives who also supported Mr Huckabee in 2008.

He warned voters against choosing a candidate only because they think that person can win and referred to 1980 when Ronald Reagan inspired Republicans and led the party to victory.

Mr Santorum added that this is his model for challenging more conventional rivals. He also said that he has become the target of increased criticism because his poll numbers have dramatically risen.

A senior adviser to Mr Santorum told CNN that his campaign has raised more money in the last week than online the past six months and fundraising is up to 400 per cent higher daily than ten days ago.

‘We have raised more money in the last few days than we have in the last few months,’ Mr Santorum said, reported CNN. ‘Going from zero to 60 in the polls, if you will, will help those resources a lot.’

'Lead this country. That's what I ask the people of Iowa. Lead, don't defer. Don't put forward somebody who isn't good enough to do what is necessary to change this country'

Rick Santorum

Riding a late burst of support after spending months as an also-ran candidate, he is trying to convince undecided voters to back his come-from-nowhere movement and pull of an unlikely win.

‘Lead this country,’ Mr Santorum said. 'That's what I ask the people of Iowa. Lead, don't defer. Don't put forward somebody who isn't good enough to do what is necessary to change this country.’

He is desperately trying to unite evangelical supporters who have been split all year between him and rivals Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann and Texas Governor Rick Perry.

Second in polls: Ron Paul is pictured left with his son Rand Paul in Davenport, Iowa, and right with his wife Carol

Local preacher Cary Gordon, who endorsed Mr Santorum recently and has urged Mrs Bachmann to give up her campaign, introduced him at an event on Sunday as a version of actor Jimmy Stewart.

‘We have raised more money in the last few days than we have in the last few months. Going from zero to 60 in the polls, if you will, will help those resources a lot'

Rick Santorum

The preacher was referring to the 1939 film ‘Mr Smith Goes to Washington’ about a concerned citizen who became a politician, also starring Jean Arthur and James Stewart.

‘We found ourselves a Mr. Smith who has proven that he will do the right thing no matter what anybody says,’ Mr Gordon said. ‘It's called integrity and character and trusthworthiness.’

Mr Santorum, who has conducted a shoestring operation with few campaign funds, has campaigned in Iowa by appearing in town after town and shaking hands, speaking and taking questions.

Mitt Romney

Iowa's caucuses will provide momentum for at least three candidates and maybe four - sending them on to the next contests in New Hampshire on January 10 and South Carolina on January 21.

Mr Romney and Texas Congressman Ron Paul lead the polls in Iowa, but Mr Santorum is in a battle for third place with Mr Perry and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

Mr Gingrich was leading the polls last month but has now admitted he doesn’t expect to gain Iowa because of how much his rivals have spent on negative ads. ‘I don't think I'm going to win,’ he said.

He added that Barack Obama should not even take his salary this year. ‘He shouldn’t pretend he’s President because he’s just a candidate - because he’s not doing the job of a President.'

'I think people are starting to figure out that this is the guy that’s going to beat Barack Obama'

Ann Romney

The Des Moines Register published its influential pre-caucus poll on Saturday, which put Mr Romney first on 24 per cent, followed by Mr Paul on 22 per cent and Mr Santorum on 15 per cent.

The survey was carried out between December 27 and 30 - but if only the last two days are counted then Mr Santorum moves into second place, showing the intense volatility in Iowa at the moment.

Mr Gingrich is on 12 per cent, Mr Perry is on 11 per cent and Mrs Bachmann is on 7 per cent. Former Utah governor Jon huntsman seems all but out of the race - and he is currently on only 2 per cent.

A Gallup report showed the race is the ‘most volatile for the GOP since the advent of polling’ as the lead has changed seven times - and was even once held by former candidate Herman Cain.

Mr Paul criticised Mr Santorum on Monday for being a ‘very liberal candidate’. And a new video advert from Mr Paul's supporters hilariously used a 'fake Mitt Romney' to 'endorse' Mr Paul.

In other news Mr Romney compared 
President Obama’s pre-election promises to reality star Kim Kardashian’s 72-day 
marriage. Fox News said this was only the second joke he has made on the
campaign trail.

Obama’s) promises and his performance is the largest I’ve seen, well, 
since the Kardashian wedding and the promise of “til death do we part”,’
Mr Romney said.

Ann Romney added, as Democrats set up events outside his own stops on 
the campaign trail.

'I can't promise you there's not some lone wolf or loose cannon who goes out and does something. But we have been adamant about people's rights to vote'

Meanwhile Iowa Republicans are worried
about Occupy protesters hacking the reporting system and have given 
tough guidance and an emergency phone number for dealing with 
demonstrations.

‘We're just not going to tolerate in 
rural Iowa what's going on in the big metropolitan areas,’ Iowa 
Representative Clel Baudler told Politico. ‘A little thump therapy never
hurt anybody.’

Occupy organiser Ed Fallon added: ‘I can't promise you there's not some lone wolf or loose cannon who goes out and does something. But we have been adamant about people's rights to vote.’
