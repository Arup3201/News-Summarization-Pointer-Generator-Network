These are the horrific images of alcohol-fuelled Robbie Williams fans involved in a mass brawl during his concert at Wembley Stadium.

Shocking footage has emerged showing around 20 men and women fighting in the crowd during the former Take That singer's gig at the venue on Sunday evening.

The violence, which is thought to have been sparked by drinks being thrown, sees shirtless men and their partners throwing punches and kicking one another as the crowd parts in the standing area of the venue.

Crowd trouble: Several women are seen to try and intervene but some appear to be squaring off at each themselves

During the melee, at least one man appears to have his shirt ripped off and another is shown holding a man to the ground as he throws repeated blows.

Several women intervene to try and break up the fight although some are also punched and one is seen stamping on a man on the floor.

A women in a red skirt, still holding a bottle of alcohol, falls to the floor herself as she tries to help.

Security personnel in coloured bibs eventually make it to the scene and try to keep the brawlers apart.

A woman is left crying on the floor as the troublemakers are dispersed.

The fight is said to have broke
out as Olly Murs joined Robbie on stage to sing their duet 'Kids' and 
continued during his song Sin Sin Sin.

Some
fans took to Twitter to express their disgust at the ugly scenes and 
criticised Wembley security for not intervening sooner.

wrote: '@robbiewilliams shame some of them acted like chavs fighting 
last night, you on the other hand were awesome :) u still got the 
magic!xx'

The violence is believe to have erupted as Olly Murs, right, took to the stage to join Robbie for a duet

Another said: 'Could not believe how 
long it took security at wembley to kick the idiot out fighting at 
Robbie Williams gig. Total prat should be locked up'

'@robbiewilliams
brilliant wembley shame the idiots who were fighting in the seating / 
standing last night spoilt it for my niece, enjoy' wrote another.

A
spokesman for Wembley Stadium said that police were called and arrests 
made - but no further action was taken because no individual wished to 
press charges.

He said: 'There was an altercation involving a small group of individuals at Sunday night’s concert.

'Stadium
security and Tour security contained the incident and following police 
involvement no further action was taken due to those involved not 
wishing to press charges.'
