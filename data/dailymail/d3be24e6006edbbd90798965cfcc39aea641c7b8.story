The mother of the four-year-old girl mauled to death by her pet bulldog had seen a sign at the re-homing centre warning it was not suitable for children but was told it was 'fine as long as he wasn't allowed to jump up'.

As Lexi Branson's grandmother said she 'could kill' staff at the centre that placed the former stray with her family, it has emerged the girl's mother Jodi Hudson had been concerned at a poster of the dog which included a warning it was unsuitable for 'small children'.

But when she asked about the sign she was told the dog would be fine if it wasn't 'allowed to jump up', a friend has said.

My pet: Lexi with the dog that would kill her weeks later in an unprovoked attack

Police said Lexi Branson was attacked without provocation in the flat she shared with mother Jodi Hudson who took a knife to the animal in a bid to save her daughter.

Yesterday, Miss Hudson, 30, paid tribute to her ‘bright, bubbly girl’ in a joint statement with her mother, Kerry. They said Lexi was a ‘shining star in the sky who would never be forgotten’.

A friend of Miss Hudson told the Daily Mirror Miss Hudson saw the dog advertised by the centre on Facebook and paid £100 for it.

The friend said: 'There was a poster of the dog inside the centre which stated underneath it was unsuitable for people with small children.

'But Jodi asked them about this and they said he'd be fine as long as he wasn't allowed to jump up.'

Grandmother Kerry has said she held Willow Tree Dog Rehoming Centre ‘responsible’ because it had allowed the dangerous dog to be taken into the home with a child.

Problematic: The bulldog named Mulan who savaged Lexi had only been with the family a few weeks after being found wondering in a park by a warden and taken to an animal shelter

Mrs Hudson, 49, said: ‘They have taken away our precious girl. I could kill them for that. They deserve whatever they get now.

‘I don’t know whether or not they knew she had a little girl.’

The rehoming centre in Barrow-upon-Soar, Leicestershire, is understood to have placed the dog, named Mulan, with Miss Hudson and Lexi at their housing association flat in the nearby village of Mountsorrel in September.

Willow Tree holds the contract to provide kennelling for strays picked up by Leicester City Council.

The animal had been taken to the centre after being found wandering in a park by a warden in August.

Police said the dog, which died from knife wounds, was thought to be six to eight years old.

Mrs Hudson said she was looking after her
daughter – estranged from Lexi’s father, Jamie Branson, 38, – because 
she was ‘not coping’ with the tragedy. She had previously described Lexi
as her ‘little miracle’ because she was born three months premature, at
1lb 1oz.

Neighbours had blamed a French Mastiff which had also been staying at the flat. But Mrs Hudson said her daughter had only been looking after the dog for a while, on behalf of a friend.

Inquest: An inquest into Lexi's death was today opened and adjourned at Loughborough Coroner's Court

An inquest was today opened and adjourned into Lexi's death.

The
hearing at Loughborough Coroner's Court heard the primary school pupil 
was confirmed dead at 1.13pm on Tuesday after being airlifted from her 
home to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham with serious injuries.

Detective
Sergeant Kenneth Henry, from Leicestershire Police, told the inquest he
went to the hospital after receiving a call on Tuesday that a 
four-year-old girl had been attacked by a dog and was en route to 
hospital with serious injuries.

Her mother formally identified her daughter's body at the hospital, the officer told the brief hearing this morning.

Det Sgt Henry told the inquest an investigation was 'ongoing' into the incident.

Post-mortem tests were being carried out on Lexi's body today.

Police
are continuing to investigate the circumstances of the incident and the
history of the dog, but have stressed it is not a criminal 
investigation.

Adjourning
the inquest pending further inquiries, senior coroner Trevor Kirkman 
said: 'I am satisfied as to the evidence of the identification of the 
deceased.

'Inquiries are continuing into the tragic death of this young girl in circumstances which have been widely reported already.

'Official inquiries are continuing and I await at this moment a full post-mortem report.

'I adjourn this inquest to a date to be fixed.

'A further mention will be listed in two weeks' time at 10am to consider when I can list a full hearing.'

Forensic tests yesterday confirmed Mulan was a bulldog – not a breed banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act.

Last night two bulldog breeders contacted by the Daily Mail separately claimed the dog in photographs released yesterday was not a pure-bred bulldog. They said it may have been a bulldog crossed with a Staffordshire Bull Terrier.

One said: ‘Bulldogs are bred for temperament. They are placid natured and great around children.

‘It is when you start crossing the breed that the problems occur.’
