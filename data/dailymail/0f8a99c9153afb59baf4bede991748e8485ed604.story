A husband killed himself six months after watching his wife commit suicide because she had caught Lyme disease from a tick bite, an inquest heard today.

Lisa Hole, from Oxford, was infected with the serious and debilitating disease after being bitten by a tick while out walking.

Her health deteriorated rapidly - leaving her wheelchair-bound and almost entirely dependent on her husband John Mladenovich.

Double tragedy: Lisa Hole, 44, killed herself after she caught the debilitating Lyme disease from a tick bite. Husband and carer John Mladenovich took his own life six months later as he could not bear to be without her

The 44-year-old eventually took an 
overdose and her husband, 46, watched his wife of 15 years die and 
waited for 90 minutes before calling an ambulance, Oxford Coroner's 
Court heard.

He
was later arrested on suspicion of assisting her suicide, before being 
released on bail. Mr Mladenovich then used the same drug as his wife to take 
his own life six months later.

He was found by police lying on a sofa, cradling photos of his beloved wife, the inquest heard.

Details of the double suicide were revealed today as consecutive inquests into both deaths were held.

Coroner Darren Salter heard that Mr 
Mladenovich, who was a contract worker at Oxford University Press, could not live 
without his wife, despite having been her carer in the final years of 
her life.

Miss Hole, who was born in Edmonton, London, had contracted Lyme Disease while out walking in 1997.

The condition left her constantly exhausted, wheelchair-bound and unable to continue her job as an editor.

Despite
her husband's doting care of her, she decided to commit suicide - and 
was found lying on her sofa by paramedics who responded to Mr 
Mladenovich's 999 call.

At the time, Mr Mladenvoch told the operator: 'My partner has taken an overdose and I think she is dead.'

South
Central Ambulance Service paramedic Matthew Winser told the inquest: 
'Mr Mladenovich said she wanted to die due to her poor quality of life.

Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread to humans by 
infected ticks.

The earliest and most common symptom of Lyme disease is a pink or red circular rash that develops around the area of the bite.

This usually appears three to 30 days after someone is bitten.

If Lyme disease is left untreated, further symptoms may develop, including:

'He had told Mr Winser she had taken the drugs an hour and a half earlier at 9.50pm and he had sat with her as she took it.'

Miss Hole had previously spoken to local newspapers as part of Tick Prevention Week to warn against the dangers of tick bites.

She told Newbury Today website in 2009: 'My life was unbearable for a number of years but I never gave up hope.

'John cared for me for a number of years. He did all the cooking, everything and pushed me around in my wheelchair.'

Mr Mladenovich had been due to answer 
bail in July this year following his wife's suicide, but was found dead 
in May, the inquest heard. 

His
friend Bryn Barrick, had alerted police after not hearing from Mr 
Mladenovich for a week and receiving no answer at his home.

'The police found a note on the door saying "I’m in the living room, I have taken my own life’,' Mr Salter told the inquest.

'He was found curled up on the sofa holding three pictures of his deceased partner.'

Mr Barrick, who had befriended Mr Mladenovich
in 2012, added: 'He was clearly distraught about about what happened to his wife.

'He talked about how he could not carry on without her and wanted to end his own life.'

Debilitating: Lyme disease is spread to humans by infected ticks. Above, Lyme disease spirochetes

Suicide notes were later discovered under a radiator and on a nearby computer, along with Mr Mladenovich's belongings neatly packed up and labelled, the inquest heard.

A post-mortem examination by Dr Sanjiv Manek found he had taken the same type of drugs found in his wife's body.

Mr Salter ruled that both Miss Hole and Mr Mladenovich, who was born in Derby, had taken their own lives and died from barbitual overdose.
