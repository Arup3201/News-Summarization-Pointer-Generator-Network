Letter: Anysha, now 19, begged the court in a letter not 
to send her father to prison and he was handed a suspended sentence

A doting father who showered his
teenage daughter with thousands of pounds worth of luxuries - including a £20,000 Super Sweet 16 
birthday party where Tulisa performed - has been spared jail after going bust.

A High Court judge had sentenced Harby Panesar to nine 
months in jail after he set up a new company in defiance of court orders after his finance business collapsed.

However, yesterday the Appeal Court quashed the prison term after Anysha, now 19, who he had bought thousands of pounds worth of presents, begged the court in a letter not to send him to prison. 

Panesar spent three years lavishing Anysha with gifts, even throwing her a celebrity-style birthday bash with a personal video from Hollywood star 
Nicole Kidman and guest singer Tulisa from N-Dubz.

The 45-year-old then bankrolled her 
dream to be a top teenage model and beauty queen, and she went on to be 
crowned America's Perfect Teen, becoming the first international cover 
girl on SuperModels magazine.

Lord Justice Rix allowed the appeal at the Civil Appeal Court and suspended his sentence for two years.

The court was told that he is now 'far removed from his once luxurious life' - and is 'financially ruined and bankrupt.'

Lord Rix said: 'The public interest will be sufficiently vindicated by suspending the term.'

Panesar doted on Anysha, lavishing her with gifts and encouraging her to live a life of luxury.

He bought his daughter a Gucci handbag
for her birthday, along with a £1,500 personalised mobile phone and a 
pair of £400 sunglasses.

He threw a Moulin Rouge-themed party and Anysha wore a £3,000 replica of a Nicole Kidman dress from the hit film.

Problems:
Panesar went bankrupt when his company Motorcare Warranties collapsed 
leaving many of his customers with worthless insurance policies. He

Musicians N-Dubz and DJ Ironik provided entertainment while there was a £500 rotating Moulin Rouge cake.

At the time of her birthday party, he 
said: 'If any parents are going to have a Super Sweet 16 party I would 
suggest that they have very long pockets and very long arms to reach in 
to those pockets.'

But Panesar’s financial empire crashed and the court froze his assets.

He made his money through his insurance company Motorcare Warranties which has collapsed.

An investigation by the Financial 
Services Authority found that the company left a trail of victims whose 
motor insurance policies were worthless.

A bankruptcy hearing in the High Court banned Panesar from setting up a new business.

But Panesar was found in contempt of court by launching up a new insurance company called Motorcare Warranties.

The new firm’s website described the 
business as 'an established family-owned company that has built up an 
excellent reputation over the years'.

But he had defied an order by 
transferring assets from a previous firm, Motorcare Warranties and had 
underpaid partner company, Templeton, by at least £2.3m.

Panesar set up the company with his father-in-law Anthony Thomas.

He was initially sentenced to nine months jail and Thomas four months - but both were granted bail pending yesterday’s appeal.

Panesar, 45, and his wife Caroline, 
43, now face losing their luxury £500,000 home and their six-acre estate
in the Vale of Glamorgan.
