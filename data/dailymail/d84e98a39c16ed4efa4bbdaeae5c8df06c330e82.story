Tim Sherwood has suggested Tottenham may be regretting letting him go last season by insisting the struggling north London club would 'take his win percentage now'.

Mauricio Pochettino replaced the 45-year-old in May but has won just 33 per cent of his Premier League games, with Spurs languishing in 12th place.

And Sherwood, whose ratio of 59 per cent is the highest of any manager in the club's history, has criticised how the Argentine manager has started at White Hart Lane.

'I reckon Spurs would take my win percentage now,' Sherwood told The Sun.

Several of Tottenham's youngsters, namely Harry Kane and Ryan Mason, have impressed this season and Sherwood believes the club must stick with the academy talent.

He also somewhat takes credit for Kane's emergence, with the England Under 21 striker scoring nine goals so far this season.

'Finding young talent and recruiting them is one thing but it's then about being brave and giving them the opportunity.

Harry Kane is a good example. I threw him into the team and he scored goals. Some of these lads can do that as well as a player that has been imported from abroad.'
