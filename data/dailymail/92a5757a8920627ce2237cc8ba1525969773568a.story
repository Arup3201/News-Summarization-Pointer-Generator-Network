A man died when a lorry smashed into the parapet of an overbridge on the M25 today.

Police closed a stretch of the southbound anti-clockwise carriageway between junctions 17 at Maple Cross and 16 at Uxbridge following the fatal crash at 1pm.

Shortly before 7pm the Highways Agency said six-mile queues had formed as far back as junction 20 at Kings Langley and warned drivers they faced two hour delays on that stretch.

Carnage: Emergency services work at the scene of the fatal crash

Debris: Part of the lorry that hit the parapet of an overbridge on the M25 can be seen lying on the ground

A second crash was reported just three miles before the scene of the fatal incident.

Three lanes were closed following the multi-vehicle crash at about 7.15pm. 

Thames Valley Police has not yet released the identity of the man but are appealing for witnesses to the crash to come forward. 

The lorry hit the bridge in wet conditions this afternoon.

Drivers trapped behind the scene were stuck for more than one hour as emergency services were called to the crash.

They were eventually diverted back at 
junction 17 and further diversions and closures have been put in place 
to try and manage the rush-hour tailbacks and allow investigators to 
examine the scene. 

Tragic: A boot lies in the road after a fatal lorry crash

Tailbacks: Queues stretched for six-miles following the fatal crash. Traffic immediately behind the incident were eventually diverted off the M25 at junction 17

Lanes one and two have been closed along that stretch for resurfacing after a fuel spillage damaged the road.

Lanes three and four re-opened shortly after 7pm but two hours later the HIghways Agency were still reported long delays.

Because of the resurfacing work, it and said normal traffic conditions are not expected until tomorrow at 6am. 

Slip roads that have been closed since evening rush-hour have still not been reopened but are expected to open to traffic soon.

The closures include the anti-clockwise M25 entry slips at junction 19, Chandlers Cross and junction 18, Chorleywood.

The Highways Agency said they were put in place to 'alleviate further congestion' as the peak period began this afternoon.

An agency spokesman said: 'We have re-opened the main 
carriageway - lanes three and four. We do not know how long it is going 
to be until the traffic is flowing but hopefully it will be soon.

'We will have to keep the inside lanes closed as 250 metres have to be resurfaced.'

A series of diversions have also been 
put in place. From junction 19, traffic is being diverted via Watford 
and from junction 18, motorists are following fiversions through 
Rickmansworth.

Drivers at junction 17 are being routed via the A412 and A40.
