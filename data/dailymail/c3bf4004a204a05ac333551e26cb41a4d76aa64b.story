Pep Guardiola will be reunited with Barcelona after his Bayern Munich were paired with the Catalan giants in the Champions League semi-finals. 

The manager is to return to the Nou Camp for the first time since leaving in 2012. Real Madrid face Juventus in the the other semi-final. 

The first legs will take place on May 5/6 with the returns the following week.

But it is the match-up between Guardiola and the club where he made his name that throws up the most exciting prospect.  

Bayern side swept Porto aside this week, hammering them 6-1 after suffering a surprise defeat in the first leg. 

Barcelona, meanwhile, were relentless in their pursuit of a last-four place, beating Zlatan Ibrahimovic's Paris Saint-Germain comfortably.

Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid side secured their place in the last four by sneaking past city rivals Atletico Madrid on Tuesday, thanks to Javier Hernandez's last-gasp decider.

Juventus were the third team to be drawn, and they will play Real Madrid in the semi-finals

That saw Real through to the semi-finals for a fifth year in a row, although Juventus will look to halt their quest to become the first side to retain the Champions League.

The 'Old Lady' have the best record of all the semi-finalists, having progressed to the final on seven of their 10 appearances at this juncture.

This is the first time Juventus have made the last-four of UEFA's flagship club competition since 2003, when a Pavel Nedved-inspired side won the second leg against Real 3-1 - 4-3 on aggregate - overturning a 2-1 first-leg deficit.
