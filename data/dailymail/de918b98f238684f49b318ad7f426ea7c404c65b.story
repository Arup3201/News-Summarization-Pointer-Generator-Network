Ed Miliband risks a row with his party by imposing the whip on a controversial vote today asking MPs to recognise the state of Palestine.

Labour MPs have been ordered to observe a one-line whip - meaning those who turn up have to back the motion which comes before the Commons today.

But it is understood that several members of the shadow cabinet had asked for it to be free vote so they could abstain, and high-profile members of Mr Miliband’s frontbench have refused to attend.

Labour figures who oppose it claim it is ‘mad’ to simply recognise a state in principle, rather than support the Israeli and Palestinians side to engage in meaningful negotiations to make it happen.

The motion, forced by Labour backbencher Grahame Morris will almost certainly get through as many Tories and Liberal Democrats – who have been given a free vote – will also back it.

One senior Labour MP, who is against the vote, said: ‘It’s completely mad. Immediate recognition of a Palestinian state will only encourage hardliners on both sides, when we should be encouraging on both sides who are willing to negotiate a peace deal to do so.

‘Long, hard, detailed negotiations are the only way to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This will cause huge anger and bitterness seven months before the election when we should be pulling together.’

The Palestinians have long sought to establish an independent, sovereign state in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem as its capital, and the Gaza Strip - where intense fighting took place in July

Alan Duncan, the former Conservative minister said the UK had a ‘historic and moral duty’ to recognise a Palestinian state, which was last year backed by 134 countries at the United Nations.

Mr Duncan said: ‘There is no reason not to. We recognised Israel in 1948 after a rather nasty civil war there, and now for too long Palestine has been occupied, they are living a miserable life.’

But several members of the shadow cabinet are unlikely to attend including Rachel Reeves, Michael Dugher and Jim Murphy, who are all members of Labour Friends of Israel (LFI).

Other high-profile absentees are likely to include Ed Miliband’s former PPS Anne McGuire, who chair LFI, Michael McCann, who is PPS to Miss Reeves; Luciana Berger, a party spokesperson on public health; Ian Austin, who was a parliamentary aide to Gordon Brown when he was prime minister; and John Woodcock, the MP for Barrow and Furness.

Many MPs are concerned that the vote will cause friction within the party just seven months ahead of the election. ‘To say that this is an unfortunate situation is an understatement’ one shadow minister told the Independent on Sunday. ‘The party didn’t need to get itself into this situation.

‘There are four statues of prime ministers in the Commons Lobby - Clement Attlee, Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and David Lloyd George. They never solved the Middle East problem, yet we’ve gone and got ourselves in a tizzy over it and think we’ve got a solution.’

The motion currently states: ‘This House believes that the Government should recognise the state of Palestine alongside the state of Israel.’

Some Labour MPs indicated they would be willing to vote for the motion if it includes an amendment proposed by a senior cross-party group of MPs, including the former foreign secretary Jack Straw which would add the words ‘as a contribution to securing a negotiated two-state solution’. John Bercow will decide whether to include the amendment until tomorrow morning.’

This summer saw the worst violence in years as Israeli troops were sent into Gaza in response to heavy rocket fire and militants infiltrating civilian areas through underground tunnels. 

A cease fire was declared after 2,100 Gazans including hundreds of children, and 73 Israelis had been killed.

Baroness Warsi, the former foreign office minister who resigned this summer calling David Cameron’s policy on the Gaza conflict ‘morally indefensible’ urged MPs to back the motion, claiming it would ‘breathe new life into the negotiations’. 

A Labour source said: ‘We would ask MPs to vote for party policy, but they are not compelled to attend.’
