There aren't many places left on the planet that remained unchartered.

But three Slovakian hikers claim to have found one of them.

Photographer Robert Nemeti and his friends Istvan Gallai and Tibor Balint say they stumbled upon an 'invisible cave' while walking in the forest near to the village of Borka in Slovakia.

Photographer Robert Nemeti and his friends Istvan Gallai and Tibor Balint stumbled upon an 'invisible cave' while walking in the forest near to the village of Borka in Slovakia

According to Mr Gallai, it was once attempted to be mapped, but efforts were abandoned because of its size

The cave, which is situated 300 metres up a mountain near to the Zadielska Tiesnava canyon, is currently unmapped and only known to a very few local people.

According to the group, the cave is so well disguised in the forest that it is almost impossible to find the entrance, even to those who know of it or have been told about its location.

They say the cave, called Marcilyuka by locals, was created by underwater rivers coming down the hillside hundreds of thousands of years ago.

It was apparently named after a local man called Marci, who used to live in it. 

To ensure they would be able to find their way out, they used a long plastic line to keep them on track and mark the route they used to come into the underground tunnels

The cave was also used by others during the Second World War as a shelter and hideaway from  enemy soldiers.

According to Mr Gallai, it was once attempted to be mapped, but efforts were abandoned because of its depth and size. 

Many of the tunnels and paths inside the cave were so narrow it was made almost impossible to navigate.

The three men say their their journey into the cave took a little longer than one hour.

During the first 20 metres, they had to slide on their backs in order to squeeze through narrow gaps.

After 50 metres, the cave opened up to a huge 'room' where they found hundreds of detailed dropstones – ancient rocks deposited by glaciers thousands of years ago.

Parts of the ceiling of the cave were very low, but at others points it was so tall they were able to walk freely through the cave.

Tibor Balint said, that 'the cave has some very narrow, very scary parts'.

He added: 'Once we got through the difficult path, we got a fantastic view of the inner room.

'We must add that the place is pretty dangerous to visit.'

The group said that they left the ancient dropstones in the cave and tried to avoid disturbing them because of the length of time they had taken to be created.
