This Porsche is unlikely to leave anyone trailing in its wake at the traffic lights.

In fact, it could lay claim to being the slowest vehicle ever made by the famed German sports car marque.

This rare Porsche tractor boasts a 38 horsepower engine, a top speed of 15mph and takes over a minute to go from 0-15mph.  In stark contrast, Porsche's fastest 
model, the 553-horsepower 911 Turbo S sports car, can hit 200 mph and 
charges to 62mph in just 3.1 seconds.

But that's unlikely to deter petrolheads from bidding on the 55-year-old farmyard machine when it comes up for auction.

Pulling power: The rare 55 year-old Super 308 tractor is expected to fetch around £20,000 when auctioned

The sleek, two-tonne tractor was built by the German motor firm in 1958 six years prior to the launch of their iconic 911 model and was used as an agricultural workhorse.

It is likely that the single-seat tractor was exported to work on crop farms where its narrow design that allowed it to squeeze between narrow rows of produce.

The Diesel Super 308 Traktor, powered by a three-cylinder air-cooled 2,625 cc engine, boasts Porsche's unique hydraulic coupling system.

The revolutionary coupling between the engine and gearbox allowed for smooth clutchless gear changes, reducing wear on the transmission components.

It has clutch and brake pedals and a hand-operated throttle situated under the rounded cowl, plus two small headlamps.

After a lifetime of hard work it underwent a full restoration in 2003 and was bought by its late owner, an enthusiastic collector, five years ago.

It is expected to fetch upwards of £18,000 when it goes under the hammer.

John Polson, motoring expert at auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'Porsche are better known for their luxury sports cars rather than their tractors but the quality is just as you'd expect from them.

'With it's top speed of 15mph this rare tractor is a world away from a classic 911 and is probably the slowest vehicle Porsche ever made, but it is a real collectors' item.

'It has been lovingly restored and we expect there to be a lot of interest in this auction.'

Ferdinand Porsche founded Porsche in 1931 in Stuttgart, Germany, initially offering car development and consulting.

The
company's first projects was to design a car for the German public on 
behalf of the German government - and the result was the Volkswagen, now
known as the Beetle.

At the same time the company developed its first tractor, the Volk Schlepper.

Pedigree: It may have a Porsche badge, but this tractor is no performance car with a top speed of only 15mph

The company went from strength to strength, launching its own 356 sports car in 1948.

Between 1956 and 1963, more than 125,000 Porsche tractors were built and enjoyed the same reputation for quality engineering as their road-going relatives.

The tractor will be sold by Bonhams at Beaulieu Motor Museum, Hants, on September 7.
