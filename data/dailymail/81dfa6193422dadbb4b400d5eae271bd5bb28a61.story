A shocking series of images that show the moment a hot air balloon collided with power lines and burst into flames, killing the 11 people on board, have been released to the public.

Considered one of New Zealand's worst air disasters, the Carterton balloon tragedy occurred almost three years ago, however photographs of the disaster have only just been made available in the name of 'public interest' following a lengthy court battle with the photographer, TVNZ reports.

The graphic images, only a few of the 600 taken of the incident by Geoff Walker, document the precise moment the balloon struck a set of power lines and instantly burst into flames.

The images of the Carterton balloon tragedy, taken by local photographer Geoff Walker, were used as evidence in the coroners inquest 

Drifting away from the point of contact, black smoke is shown billowing from the basket which appears to be completely engulfed in flames after hitting the power lines 

The shrivelled and burnt balloon is swallowed by the surrounding plumes as it plummets to the ground, while the basket is unrecognisable behind the inferno

Drifting away from the point of contact, black smoke is shown billowing from the basket which appears to be completely engulfed in flames in the second image.

In the final and most disturbing photo, a shrivelled and burnt balloon is swallowed by the surrounding plumes as it plummets to the ground, while the basket is unrecognisable behind the inferno.

Initially all of the images, which were submitted as evidence for the public inquest into the disaster, had been banned from public release due to their sensitive nature.

However after requests from local media and the families of the victims, the coroner in charge of the case, Peter Ryan, authorised the public release of four.

More victims: Stephen Hopkirk, Belinda Harter, Howard Cox, Johannes Jordaan also died in the fatal hot air balloon crash in 2012

Desmond and Ann Dean, aged 70 and 65 years respectively, were two more of the victims

Mr Walker challenged the decision, claiming copyright and arguing that their release 'didn't do anyone any good', however this was dismissed by Justice Allan Mackenzie, who ruled that the evidence presented at a public inquest should be accessible, according to Stuff.co.nz.

The father of Alexis Still, who was one of the victims in the crash, said he supported the publication of the images as he believed they could prevent further tragedies.

'You can read about the accident, but when you see it in action, it brings it home,' he told Stuff.co.nz.

The inquiry heard that pilot Lance Hopping, who also died during the accident, was a long-term pot smoker. A post-mortem found traces of the drug in the 53-year-old's system

The coroner is yet to release his findings on the disaster, however in 2014 the hearing heard that the balloon's pilot, Lance Hopping, was a regular cannabis user who hid his addiction from authorities, according to testimonies from his partner and an associate.

A post-mortem found traces of the drug in the 53-year-old's system, which could possibly have affected his judgment while flying the vessel.

Coroner Ryan stated that the inquest's purpose was to determine the facts of the event and establish recommendations that will help prevent similar incidents in the future. 

The crash area, near the town of Carterton, was only a short distance north of New Zealand's capital

Local media and the families of the victims argued for the graphic pictures to be made public to prevent further tragedies

'You can read about the accident, but when you see it in action, it brings it home,' the father of one of the victims said

The head of the investigation, Detective Inspector Sean Hansen, testified that the balloon hit 33kV lines before the electrical arc sparked a fire.

This was followed by the LPG tank rupturing, the gas adding to the fire.

The victims of the tragedy include Lance Hopping, Desmond and Ann Dean, Alexis Still and Chrisjan Jordaan were Valerie Bennett, Ms Bennett's cousin Denise Dellabarca, husband and wife Howard and Diana Cox, Stephen Hopkirk and Belinda Harter.
