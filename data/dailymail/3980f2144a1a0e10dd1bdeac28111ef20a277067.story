At the age of 76 he became a household name and a magazine cover star.

But Pope Francis is apparently desperate to avoid becoming a celebrity – he has ordered the removal of a new life-size statue of him in Buenos Aires cathedral.

Since its installation two weeks ago believers visited the statue in the cathedral’s garden to pay homage to the pontiff, while tourists posed for photos alongside it. 

The statue of Pope Francis is made of fiberglass and is 5' 6'' tall. It was installed at the Buenos Aires' Cathedral at the end of June

Pope Francis has been accused of 
encouraging illegal immigration after expressing solidarity with asylum 
seekers and economic refugees during his visit to the island of Lampedusa.

During his visit on Monday, Francis said 
the tens of thousands of migrants from Africa and the Middle East who arrive from Tunisia and Libya should be dealt with compassionately.

He said the asylum seekers were 'brothers and sisters of ours trying to escape difficult situations to find some serenity and peace'.

But Francis, formerly Archbishop of the Argentine capital, was reportedly horrified at the news.

He got straight on the phone and had strong words with the priest responsible telling him: ‘Get that thing down, immediately’, the Argentinian newspaper Clarin reported. 

Church sources told the newspaper that Francis is determined to avoid creating ‘a cult of personality’ like that enjoyed by John Paul II.

Since his election in March, Francis has gone to lengths to be seen as humble, showing little patience for the pomp and fuss that come with his position as head of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics.

The statue was popular with tourists, who often posed alongside it for photographs

He rarely wears the robes and trimmings 
traditionally allocated to the Pope, continuing instead to wear a simple
 white cassock and iron cross.

He has refused to move into the luxurious Papal apartments, saying they are too grand, and prefers to live instead in a humble guesthouse for visiting clerics, with whom he eats meals and offers mass every morning.

But his new celebrity is unavoidable - especially as the statue’s removal coincides with the naming of Francis as Man of the Year by Vanity Fair magazine’s Italian edition.

The magazine gushed: ‘His first 100 days have already placed him in the category of world leaders who make history. But the revolution continues…’

The announcement was followed by a slew of celebrity endorsements.

Elton John commented: 'Francis is a miracle of humility in a an era of vanity.’

The statue, installed ten days ago, was the vision of sculptor Fernando Pugliese, who also created the statues for a Catholic theme park called Holy Land in Argentina. He has previously produced statues of John Paul II and Mother Teresa.

It remains to be seen whether a Francis museum at the site, announced two weeks ago, will also be vetoed by the Pope.
