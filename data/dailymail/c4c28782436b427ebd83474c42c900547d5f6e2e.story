Former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin has criticized the Obama administration’s decision to supply weapons to the rebels in the civil war in Syria, arguing that the U.S. should ‘Let Allah sort it out’ until there is a stronger leader in the White House.

‘Militarily, where is our commander in chief? We’re talking now more new interventions. I say until we know what we’re doing, until we have a commander and chief who knows what he’s doing, well, let these radical Islamic countries who aren’t even respecting basic human rights, where both sides are slaughtering each other as they scream over an arbitrary red line, “Allah Akbar,” I say until we have someone who knows what they’re doing, I say let Allah sort it out,’ Palin said at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference on Saturday.

The White House confirmed on Thursday that it had conclusive evidence that Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime has used chemical weapons against rebel forces.

The use of weapons such as the nerve agent sarin crosses what President Barack Obama has called a 'red line' that would trigger greater American involvement in the crisis.

Obama discussed the civil war in Syria with European leaders in a teleconference on Friday, and the issue is expected to dominate much of the conversation at next week’s G-8 Summit in Northern Ireland.

The White House is now considering arming the opposition fighters and enforcing a no-fly zone that could cost an estimated $50 million a day.

The final speaker at the three-day Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference, former Alaska Gov. Palin rejected calls for an immigration overhaul that includes a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally.

Palin, who is rejoining Fox News Channel as an analyst less than half a year after they decided to part ways, also called Washington, D.C. ‘one hot mess,’ reports ABC News.

She also offered a warning to 'the good old boys' in the GOP leadership who are calling for conservative activists to tone down aggressive rhetoric.

'You do not marginalize, you don't discredit and dismiss, every day average hard-working Americans - those who are part of that grass-roots tea party movement,' she said.

'Just let them tell us to sit down and shut up,' Palin said later, 'which I refuse to do.'

She also took a swipe at another speaker at the conservative forum, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who argued Friday that one of the reasons to support the Senate’s immigration reform plan is because ‘Immigrants are more fertile.’

‘I think it’s kind of dangerous 
territory, territory to want to debate this whole one race’s fertility 
rate over another, and I say this from someone who’s kind of fertile 
herself,’ Palin said.

‘I don’t think that’s where we want to go in deciding how will we incentivize the hardworking responsible families who want to live in the light, follow the law, become Americans, versus those whose very first act on our soil is to break the law? There are different ways that we can debate this.’

As she warned the conservative crowd of ‘tyranny’ in government, Palin said that the recent scandals involving the Internal Revenue Service and the National Security Agency make the country feel ‘so Orwellian around here, you know, “1984.’”

Palin's first appearance since returning to Fox is scheduled for Monday on the 'Fox & Friends' morning show – on the same day CNN is premiering a morning show to great fanfare.

Fox and Palin parted ways in January after she had worked there for three years as a contributor.

They had talked about renewing their contract, but it didn't happen.

Money may have been a factor: Palin was 
signed for a reported $1 million a year when she originally joined Fox 
less than two years after being John McCain's running mate.

Fox News chief Roger Ailes said in a statement: 'I've had several conversations with Governor Palin in the past few weeks about her rejoining FOX News as a contributor.

'I have great confidence in her and am pleased that she will once again add her commentary to our programming.

'I hope she continues to speak her mind.'

Palin also hit headlines this week for blasting comedian Bill Maher on Twitter Wednesday, saying she hopes his 'lily white a**' gets flattened, after he reportedly made a joke directed at her 5-year-old special needs son.

Palin learned of the alleged joke from a conservative writer for Breitbart News, who attended Maher's stand-up show in The Pearl concert venue at The Palms Hotel in Las Vegas on Saturday.

The writer, Ron Futrell, wrote in a blog that he attended the show with friends and became inflamed when Maher made a comment referring to Palin's son Trig, who has Downs Syndrome, as 'retarded.'
