Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we learned from the Premier League and Football League this week, including a sense of deja vu at Stamford Bridge.

1) Calum Chambers had never been booked in 25 senior appearances for Southampton before his £16million move to Arsenal this summer.

Maybe he is trying too hard at his new club, because the yellow card the 19-year-old collected from referee Michael Oliver for fouling Aaron Lennon five minutes from the end of the north London derby was his FIFTH in 11 games this year.

Not that Tottenham were angels. The 16 fouls that Mauricio Pochettino’s team committed was only one less than were made by both sides put together in the Merseyside derby.

2) Ronald Koeman proved that having a go in the Capital One Cup needn’t harm your Premier League chances with the team that beat QPR 2-1 to keep Southampton in second place in the early table.

In a week when most clubs changed their entire team in midweek, Koeman used nine of the players who had started in the win at Arsenal in his opening line-up. Ryan Bertrand, who got the opening goal against Rangers, had also been on the pitch at the Emirates, where he came on as a late sub.

3) Chelsea’s blistering start to the season has seen the bookies install them as odds-on favourites to regain the Barclays Premier League title – and sparked discussion on whether Jose Mourinho’s side can stay top from start to finish as Arsenal did the last time they won the competition in 2004.

A word of caution before the blue bunting is being set out and the open top bus booked for the King's Road, though. Only once since then have the side who topped the table at the end of September gone on to be crowned champions.

Who did that? A certain Mr Mourinho with Chelsea in 2006. We shall see if he can do it again.

4) Keith Stroud was considered one of the country’s brightest refereeing prospects when he was promoted to the Premier League list back in 2007, but struggled to handle top flight games and got knocked back down to the Football League list after barely a year.

The 45-year-old is back in the big time this season, though, and had his first Premier League game since 2008 when he took charge of Crystal Palace’s clash with Leicester.

It was a good choice of game for him, coming through without any major controversy as Palace won 2-0.

5) There are signs that Louis van Gaal isn’t afraid to go down the Sir Alex Ferguson route of applying pressure on referees at Old Trafford.

His Match of the Day moan to Gary Lineker about a mythical foul on David de Gea in the build-up to West Ham’s goal was rather peculiar.

More worrying was the way United’s players chased referee Lee Mason trying to get Diafra Sakho in trouble for a foul on Rafael when the home team were already down to 10 men. Not as bad as the infamous time Roy Keane led a charge on Andy D’Urso, but not pretty either.

6) West Brom’s five midfield players – Graham Dorrans, James Morrison, Stephane Sessegnon, Craig Gardner and Chris Brunt - are all fairly similar in style and stature, and in theory the combination shouldn’t have enough balance to work.

But they combined brilliantly against Burnley to keep the ball for long periods and help Alan Irvine’s side dominate the game.

Collectively the five played 312 passes and found their own man with 283 of them – a success rate of nearly 91 per cent.

7) Albert Adomah suffered a miserable end to a bad week after missing the Anfield penalty that meant Liverpool survived that epic 14-13 shoot-out in the Capital One Cup.

The former Bristol City striker was possibly still dwelling on the disappointment when he picked up two silly yellow cards and the inevitable red as Middlesbrough battled out a goalless draw at Charlton.

It’s the first time the 26-year-old has ever been sent off in 311 senior games since he made his League debut for Barnet in January 2008.

8) Bryan Ruiz spent the last part of the summer trying to get away from Fulham as one of several experienced players who fell out with Felix Magath.

For different reasons moves to PSV Eindhoven, Besiktas and Werder Bremen all fell through – which turns out to be good news for whoever gets the job to follow Magath as Craven Cottage boss.

Caretaker Kit Symons has put the 29-year-old star of Costa Rica’s World Cup campaign straight back into his starting team, and Ruiz played a major role in the 2-1 win at Birmingham.

9) Coventry are getting back to reality all too quickly, just three weeks after 27,306 packed the Ricoh Arena to the rafters to celebrate the club’s return to the city.

Just 11,085 were at the next game to see them beat Yeovil, and that had fallen again to 10,006 for Saturday’s 2-0 defeat by Preston.

10) Young Charlton striker Joe Pigott is using a loan spell at Newport to help get his head together after being involved in a car crash while on holiday in South Africa during the summer in which his close friend, goalkeeper George Howard, was critically injured.

Howard, who played with 20-year-old Pigott at Gillingham, is recovering slowly from what were life threatening injuries and gets MailOnline’s best wishes.

Pigott, meanwhile, has made a strong impression at the start of a three-month loan in South Wales and his two goals against AFC Wimbledon lifted Justin Edinburgh’s team to within two points of the play-off zone.
