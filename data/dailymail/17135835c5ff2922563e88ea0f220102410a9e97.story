The brother of a super-fit charity swimmer today told how he watched his sister collapse just one mile from the French coast as she attempted to achieve her childhood dream of crossing the English Channel.

Susan Taylor lost consciousness in front of her horrified husband, Stephen, and paramedic brother David Wright, who were both travelling alongside the 34-year-old in a support boat.

She was pulled from the water and airlifted to hospital in Boulogne, but declared dead on arrival.

Tragedy: Susan Taylor, 34, collapsed and died just one mile from the French coast while attempting to swim the English Channel for charity

In a statement read out at her inquest in Loughborough, her brother told how the former accountant, who had 
quit work to train for the gruelling challenge, set off from Dover at 
2am on July 14 last year, with 'nothing untoward' happening in the first
 few hours of the swim.

Mr Wright said: 'She had been sick several times during the 
swim, but that did not seem unusual and was not a cause for concern.

'But towards the end she seemed to be having difficulty maintaining her stroke rate and was showing signs of fatigue.

'She
 kept going and Susan continued to try to swim but had to stop again and
 was sick. I told her to get out of the water if she wanted to.

'She made no effort to move towards the ladder and lay and lay on her back, appearing unconscious.

'She then rolled onto her front and was lying face down motionless.'

Mrs Taylor was lifted from the water by a
 member of her support team, who leapt into the sea to help, while the 
boat's pilot radioed for assistance.

But Mr Wright said she wasn't breathing, and 'immediate medical procedures were commenced'.

A French lifeguard boat arrived within 
nine minutes, and Mrs Taylor, who was swimming to raise money for 
Diabetes UK and Rainbows children's Hospice in Loughborough, was then 
winched aboard a helicopter before being flown to hospital.

But tragically, medics were unable to save her.

Mrs Taylor's brother David Wright told an inquest how she started to have difficulty maintaining her stroke rate and was sick several times before she collapsed

The inquest into Mrs Taylor's death 
heard 'nothing could have been done' to save her life. The hearing was 
told she died of 'acute cardio-respiratory collapse caused by prolonged 
open sea swimming'.

Coroner Trevor Kirkman said: 'It is likely there is only a very short period when anything could have been done, and in any event Susan received very prompt attention from medical professionals.

'She appeared physically very fit, and all the information indicated she was well-prepared. The outcome could not have been predicted and the pathologist is of the view that all that could be done was done.'

Recording a verdict of death by misadventure, Mr Kirkman added: 'She was very nearly there and sadly, tragically, she collapsed.

'I understand she was undertaking the swim not for personal glory, although I have to say it is an achievement not many of us would ever even be able to contemplate.

'She was undertaking it for her love of other people, and desire to help other people. I'm told she was a kind and caring person, very involved in charity work, and she probably achieved more in her life than any of us could hope to achieve.

'It is tragic that her attempt that was so very nearly successful should end in this awful way.'

Turning to Mrs Taylor's parents, Arthur and Joyce Wright, and brother, who attended the inquest, Mr Kirkman said: 'All that she has done is not lost, and you all have good memories of her, I am quite certain. As a family you should be very proud of her.'

After the hearing, her brother Mr Wright
 said: 'As a result of the inquest verdict, we can now have closure on 
what happened to Susan.

'She was a wonderful person and was 
dedicated to helping those less fortunate than herself. It was a great 
comfort that Susan died attempting to accomplish her childhood ambition 
in aid of two worthy causes.'

Mrs Taylor's husband, a 43-year-old electrician, did not attend the inquest.

His wife, of Barwell, Leicestershire, had spent 18 months preparing for the swim, even quitting her job so she could train full time in swimming pools and lakes near her home in sessions lasting up to eight hours.

In the weeks leading up to the attempt, she wrote in a blog how it was her childhood dream to swim the channel.

After her death, donations poured in to the charities she was swimming for, and as of tonight she had raised almost £82,000 on her Virgin Money Giving website for Rainbows children's hospice.

Before setting off, she wrote on the site how the challenge was 'tougher than Everest'.

Mrs Taylor added: 'Less than 1,000 people have completed the 21-mile cross-Channel swim, whereas over 3,000 have conquered the world's tallest mountain. Only one in ten people who train for the channel actually complete it.

'The English Channel is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, with over 600 tankers and 200 ferries crossing it every day. Other problems include debris, jellyfish, currents and tides.

'As part of the challenge you are not allowed to wear anything that aids buoyancy or warmth. However, I will be accompanied by a support boat to ensure I stay out of trouble.'Mrs Taylor was the eighth swimmer to die since Captain Matthew Webb made the first unassisted swim across the Strait of Dover in 1875.The last fatality before her was 45-year-old Paraic Casey, of Cork, Ireland, who died in July 2012.Like Mrs Taylor, he collapsed just a mile from the French coast.
