Former professional football player turned actor Terry Crews has said the NFL is 'really like a cult' during a recent interview talking about how former players took medications provided by team doctors without being told the long-term effects.

'The NFL is a cult, because you’ve been looking at this motto and this logo for your whole life and you believe in it and you’re like "They wouldn’t do anything to hurt me. They never would."’ Crews told SI Now. 'And, uh oh, maybe they would.”

Crews comments come as yet another lawsuit was filed by former players on Tuesday who accuse the league of providing painkillers and other drugs, allowing the players to continue in games despite inuries, without disclosing the fact the medications can cause complications in the future.

On Tuesday, the NFL was hit with another lawsuit from former players who accused the league of providing painkillers and other drugs that would allow the players to remain in the game and avoid missing any time, but led to serious complications later in life.

More than 600 players have joined the suit. It claims that doctors and trainers gave out the drugs without a prescription and without warning of side effects.

The lawsuit also says that the drugs were given in combinations as 'cocktails.'

'The stuff works,' Jeremy Newberry, who played most of his career for the San Francisco 49ers before retiring in 2009, told The Associated Press. 'It works like crazy. It really does.'

Crews' brief NFL career included playing for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers, Washington Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles

Newberry, who is part of the suit, says that because of the drugs he took while playing, he suffers from kidney failure, high blood pressure and violent headaches.

Crews said that when you spend your life working toward a goal, you will do everything you possibly can to keep that goal alive. As a result, you might follow what others tell you if you think it will benefit your career, he noted.

'When you give your life over to something like that and give your total trust into something like that, it will always disappoint you,' Crews added.

Crews had a relatively short career playing for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers, Washington Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles.

He currently plays Detective Sergeant Terence 'Terry' Jeffords on the sitcom 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine.' He is featured in the movie 'Blended' that opened today. His other film roles include parts in 'Bridesmaids,' 'The Expendables,' 'The Longest Yard' and 'White Chicks.'
