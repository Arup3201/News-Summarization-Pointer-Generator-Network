It seems someone has been watching too many Compare the Market adverts.

For Luke the kitten appears to have picked up a trick or two from those eccentric meerkats who front the comparison site's marketing campaign.

Faced with a situation where he couldn't see what was happening on the other side of the room, the curious Scottish Fold rears up on his back legs to get a better view of the action.

Cat's the way to do it: Luke the Scottish Fold kitten rears up on his hind legs like a meerkat so he can see what's happening on the other side of the room

The move is remarkably similar to the famous 'sentry' position adopted by the desert-dwelling mammals when keeping a look-out for predators.

Video footage of Luke's new skills was posted on YouTube with the message: 'Meet Luke, a Scottish Fold kitten that can stand on his hind legs!'

Scottish Folds are known for being playful and affectionate and the distinctive physical traits of the breed, combined with their reputation as loving companions, make them highly sought-after pets.

Meerkats, on the other hand, are part of the mongoose family and live in large families in burrows in the desert.

Mimicry: The move is remarkably similar to the famous 'sentry' position adopted by the desert-dwelling mammals (right) when keeping a look-out for predators

Has he been watching too much TV? Meerkats are a household name now thanks to the Compare the Market adverts (above)

They work as a team with some standing on their hind legs keeping look-out, thereby allowing the others to forage and dig.

They are one of the 66 viverrid species, a widespread and diverse family of carnivores that includes the civets and mongooses and come from central and south Africa.

But despite the misleading name, cats are in no way related to meerkats, so Luke's skills for mimicry definitely aren't in the blood.
