The final chance to see Nelson Mandela's body descended into chaos today as up to 100,000 South African mourners flocked to his casket sparking stampedes and crushes in central Pretoria.

Today was the third and final day that the former president lay in state before his funeral takes place on Sunday.

And in one waiting area in Pretoria, people pushed open a gate that the police had closed, shouting that they wanted to see their hero.

Several hundred mourners broke through police barriers and stormed up toward the Union Buildings shortly before Mr Mandela's body was moved away.There was no violence and police peacefully brought them back in line.

But some fell to the ground as the crowd surged, and several were slightly injured. The government said some 92,000 people had gathered by late morning, but closed nearby parking facilities around midday because of the huge crowds.

'It's almost impossible that all of them will go through,' government spokeswoman Phumla Williams said. 'The volumes are just huge.'

It appeared the government's earlier 
plea for people not already in line to stay away amid fears of mass 
overcrowding had fallen on deaf ears as more people surged towards 
'Madiba's' coffin.

A 
spokesman said: 'We appeal to members of the public who have not had the
opportunity to pay their respects to President Mandela at the Union 
Buildings, to say goodbye in their own personal way.'

Organizers handed out water to the crowds, and moved up elderly people and women with children to spare them a longer wait.

As people kept arriving, the government warned it couldn't guarantee that all people currently will be able to file past Mandela's casket until the agreed limit on Friday afternoon.

Some of those who did view the body at the Union Buildings, a century-old government complex overlooking the city, wept at the sight of the revered anti-apartheid leader in a coffin.

Mourner Elizabeth Leening said she got
up at 3am and headed toward Pretoria's Union Buildings an hour later to
pay her last respects to Mandela.

'We
have been standing in the queue now for four hours to see Madiba,' she 
said, using Mandela's clan name as a sign of affection and respect.

Mandela,
who was jailed for 27 years during white rule and later became 
president, died on December 5 in his Johannesburg home after a long 
illness at the age of 95.
