A woman who worked at a Philadelphia abortion clinic for eight years has testified that patients were routinely given too much medication - to the point that women went into labour 'too fast'.

Latosha Lewis, who is a witness in the murder trial against her former boss Dr. Kermit Gosnell, said records were so poorly kept it was hard to know how much medication each woman had been given.

Gosnell, 72, is charged with murdering seven babies at Philadelphia Women's Medical Society and with the death of a woman, who suffered cardiac arrest after she was given too much anesthesia.

Lewis initially worked as a 'medical assistant' but said she stopped helping him out during abortions because she was concerned about the level of anesthesia used during one procedure.

'I was the person who had given her too 
much and I was concerned whether she would come up from anesthesia,' 
Lewis, 31, told the jury, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

She added that the women were given so much medication to soften the cervix that 'people were going into labor too fast. I didn't want to deal with it'.

Other witnesses in the case have 
revealed that the women began aborting the fetuses so quickly that they 
delivered them in the waiting room or the toilet.

Instead, Lewis said she started working on the reception desk and carrying out ultrasounds.

She has not been charged in the murder case against Gosnell and cooperated with authorities.

'Victim': Karnamaya Mongar, 41, died at Gosnell's clinic during an abortion procedure in November 2009

Murder? Some former employees at the Women's Medical Society, said many women came to the clinic for abortions but looked as if they were too far along in their pregnancies to be there

However, she was charged in a December 2011 case claiming that Gosnell was selling prescriptions for powerful narcotics and addictive painkillers. Lewis pleaded guilty to drug 
distribution charges.

Gosnell, 72, is charged with seven counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of seven infants born alive during abortions. He allegedly killed the babies by cutting their spinal cords with scissors.

Gosnell is also charged with one count of third-degree murder in the 
death of Karnamaya Mongar, who was killed by an 
overdose of pain medication administered during an abortion procedure.

If found guilty, Gosnell faces a possible death sentence.

Last week, Lynda 
Williams, 44, testified to seeing babies have their 
necks snipped by Gosnell.

Williams, said Gosnell taught her how 
to turn a baby over and cut its neck with a pair of scissors - but she 
only did it once because it gave her 'the creeps.'

She added it was one of her duties to pick up babies that women would spontaneously give birth to in the waiting room after getting large doses of drugs, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

She
told the jury that Gosnell changed paperwork on patients
that were too heavily pregnant to undergo an abortion so that they appeared to be less than 24 weeks - the legal time limit.

She
added that pain medication was sometimes out of date or did not work - 
and she would see Gosnell 'smack' the legs of women who squirmed, 
leaving his hand print behind.

Her testimony came a day after 
another worker, Sherry West, told the court how she was once handed an 
underdeveloped newborn with no eyes or mouth and told to deal with it.

Other employees have described how they saw about 100 babies born alive and then 'snipped'.

Rundown: An internal shot of the clinic, which was allegedly reeking of animal urine and feces

Some told the court of gruesome 
scenes at the clinic which was allegedly found dirty and rundown with 
rusting surgical instruments.

A Grand Jury report said the clinic was
crawling with cats and reeking of animal urine and feces. Furniture and
blankets were stained with blood and instruments were not properly 
sterilized.

Disturbingly, the report alleged that fetal remains were stuffed 
into: 'cabinets, in the basement, in a freezer, in jars and bags and 
plastic jugs'.

'It
would rain fetuses. Fetuses and blood all over the place. It is 
literally a beheading. It is separating the brain from the body,' one former employee Stephen Massof told NBC.

But he said he believed the 
intentions of his boss were honest and that the doctor believed he was helping the 
women, often extremely poor, who came to him

The doctor: Kermit Gosnell

Charged: Pearl Gosnell

Employee: Elizabeth Hampton

Arrested: Tina Baldwin

Assistant: Sherry West

Worker: Adrine Moton

Accomplice: Eileen O'Neil

Locked up: Stephen Massof

Held: Maddline Joe

'I believe that Dr. Gosnell was honestly trying to help women and protect them from abuse and neglect,' Massof said.

The trial is in its fourth week and is expected to last another month. If Gosnell is found guilty he could be given the death penalty. 

Eight clinic employees have pleaded guilty to various charges, while a ninth is on trial with Gosnell. 

Gosnell's lawyer denies the murder charge and disputes that any 
babies were born alive. He also challenges the gestational age of the 
aborted fetuses, calling them inexact estimates.
