Angela Merkel has ordered its intelligence service to spy on the U.S and Britain for the first time since 1945, according to reports.

The move will see Germany’s equivalent of MI5, the BND, monitor British and American spying operations on its soil.

The move is thought to be a response to the discovery earlier this month of two alleged U.S. spies in Germany and revelations that the U.S. National Security Agency was conducting mass surveillance of German citizens and eavesdropping on Merkel's cellphone.

On the look-out: Angela Merkel has ordered its intelligence service to spy on the U.S and Britain for the first time since 1945

A government source told Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper: ‘We need to send a strong signal.’

After the defeat of the Nazis and the end of World War II in 1945, the new authorities of West Germany adopted a policy of turning a blind eye to the intelligence activities of some of the victors, namely the U.S., Britain and France. 

In response to the discovery of the U.S spies Merkel demanded the departure of the CIA station chief in Berlin.

This week President Barack Obama dispatched two senior advisers to Germany in an apparent effort to soothe tensions following the new allegations.

The White House says chief of staff Denis McDonough and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco are in Berlin for meetings with their German counterparts. The White House says intelligence and security matters were in the agenda.

The White House says the U.S. and Germany agreed to set up a dialogue to address intelligence concerns on both sides.

'Trust can only be restored through talks and certain agreements,' Merkel said. 'We will seek out such talks, though I can't announce anything concrete right now.'

Merkel, who grew up in communist East Germany where state surveillance was a fact of life, said her administration and that of U.S. President Barack Obama have 'different positions on what's needed to guarantee security and at the same time protect personal data.'

While the Obama administration has remained largely silent, U.S. commentators have defended the need to spy on even close allies such as Germany, citing the country's close links to Russia and fact that several members of the 9/11 terror cell lived in Hamburg before the attacks.

Despite the spy row, Merkel insisted that Germany and the U.S. remain close partners 'and nothing about this will change.'

Merkel dismissed the idea that her government would allow Edward Snowden, the NSA contractor whose leaks sparked a worldwide flurry of reports on U.S. spy activity, to come to Germany.

'We learned things (from him) that we didn't know before, and that's always interesting,' she said of Snowden's revelations, but added, 'granting asylum isn't an act of gratitude.'

Earlier a top White House official pledged that the CIA will no longer use vaccination programs as cover for spying operations. The agency used the ruse in targeting Osama bin Laden before the U.S. raid that killed him in 2011.

Lisa Monaco, President Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, wrote to the deans of 13 prominent public health schools, saying the CIA has agreed it would no longer use vaccination programs or workers for intelligence purposes. The agency also agreed to not use genetic materials obtained through such programs.
