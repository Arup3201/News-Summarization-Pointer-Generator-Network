by Robert Macfarlane

(Hamish Hamilton £20)

At University College London in the Sixties, one door in the English Department was marked The English Place Name Society. During my three years as a student I never saw anyone enter or leave that room, and imagined mountains of dusty books and documents, rambled by spiders, forgotten maps of a dead world. A ciste: Gaelic for burial chamber.

Because the original meanings of place names are largely forgotten and ancient local names for hills, streams and bogs have fallen out of use, Robert Macfarlane performs a miracle of resurrection in his new book.

Reviving a fascinating archive of old terms from Anglo-Saxon to Old Norse, he dances through the closed door of the past — a labour of love as well as learning.

Original meanings of place names are largely forgotten and ancient local names for hills, streams and bogs have fallen out of use

For years he’s been passionately engaged with the work of men and women who have written about the natural world, such as Richard Jefferies, Barry Lopez, Jacquetta Hawkes and Roger Deakin. These are his spiritual guides to the landscape he loves.

For, as well as the milestones of the mind (those books and encounters which shape us), there are the landmarks all around us: from the smallest tussock to trees, rocks, beaches and hidden valleys.

All of these were named by our ancestors with particular, peculiar and poetic terms which probably fell out of common use in the last 100 years.

So, each chapter describes the work of one or two writers who have shaped Macfarlane’s thinking, and takes us on an imaginary walk into their worlds.

And then comes a ‘glossary’, lists of names for things specific to one aspect of landscape.

These lists are fascinating. For example, eit: a tiny word from the Isle of Lewis with a huge meaning: ‘The practice of placing quartz stones in moorland streams so they would sparkle in the moonlight and thereby attract salmon to them in the late summer and autumn.’

People in Essex used to call you ‘watery-headed’ if you were anxious about rain. And how about the glorious list of words for icicle: aquabob (Kent), clinkerbell and conkerbell (Dorset), daggler and dagglet (Hampshire), ickle (Yorkshire) and shuckle (Cumbria).

Macfarlane says: ‘This is a book about the power of language — strong style, simple words — to shape our sense of place.’

He begins and ends this impressive and unusual book with children — which is as it should be. For who else will inherit the Earth?

Like many of us, he was deeply shocked when the new edition of the Oxford Junior Dictionary left out words no longer seen as ‘relevant’ to modern childhood, including acorn, bluebell, buttercup, catkin, conker, dandelion, fern, heather, heron, ivy, lark, mistletoe, newt, otter, pasture and willow.

That’s why Macfarlane ends by describing a thrilling project with primary school children given free access to explore a park in winter. Their writing about this experience, over months, turned the ordinary park into a place of wonder where ‘new stories seethed from its soil’.

To deprive children of that natural birthright Robert Macfarlane celebrates in all his work is to cut out an essential part of their hearts.
