A U.S. filmmaker has emulated the ageing process by 'creating a person' called Danielle, who subtly changes in front of viewers' eyes from childhood into old age.

The five minute video was created by Anthony Cerniello and is a refinement of the 'photo-a-day' concept that was popular a few years ago.

Mr Cerniello's 'Danielle' project was not shot over a lifetime, but is made up of photographs of family members of different generations who were photographed in similar conditions at roughly the same time.

Youth: The video starts with the image of a toddler staring at the camera

A very young 'Danielle' - the sequence is a refinement of the 'photo-a-day' concept that was popular a few years ago

Aged a little: 'Danielle' was not shot over a lifetime, but the project is made up of photographs of family members of different generations

The video unsurprisingly starts with 
'Danielle' as a small girl and at first it is as if nothing is 
happening, but if viewers watch carefully they can see the ageing 
process effecting the girl's features very slowly.

It
 is uncanny as viewers realise the face is changing but it is hard to
 pinpoint exactly what is going on and if the video is paused, the image
 just looks like a regular photographic portrait of a moment captured in
 time.

The filmmaker, who usually edits commercials and music videos for bands like the Kings of Leon, said: 'The idea was that something was happening but you can't see it but you can feel it, like ageing itself,' tech website iO9 reported.

family members at different ages to create what looks like a time lapse 
video.

Now clearly older: The filmmaker went to a friend's family reunion and with photographer Keith Scirchio took photos of her youngest cousins through to her oldest relatives

This is the latest and most sophisticated project that fits in a body of photographic and video work by artists to track the ageing process, including the 'portrait-a-day' idea made famous by Noah Kalina's 'Everyday' time lapse project.

According to Colossal, Mr Cerniello went to his friend Danielle's family reunion and together with photographer Keith Scirchio, took photos of her youngest cousins through to her oldest relatives.

In New York, the duo scanned each photo with a drum scanner and painstakingly edited the photos to select family members with the most similar facial features, including bone structure.

Still photos were blended into one another in the most lifelike way possible, smoothing out details like the eyes to make it seem like a seamless ageing process

Now an older version of 'Danielle': the pictures were of select family members with the most similar facial features and bone structure

Old...'Danielle' has finally morphed into an old woman in five minutes

A pair of animators then morphed and animated the still photos to blend them into one another in the most lifelike way possible, smoothing out details like the eyes and hair to make it look like a seamless ageing process.

He told the design website: 'I wanted to make a person, I felt like I could tell a story with that, but it ended up feeling slightly robotic, like an android.'

He also said that he imagined the accompanying music would tell the story of Danielle's life with 'events speeding up as she aged' but he then decided to opt for abstract sounds.
