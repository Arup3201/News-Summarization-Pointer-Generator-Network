She's been rubbing shoulders with royalty and celebrities in London following 10 years of self-imposed exile.

So it's no wonder Monica Lewinsky was looking tired after jetting into Los Angeles airport this morning.

After making a splash at social events wearing sleek wraparound dresses, the 40-year-old opted for a casual sweater and pants as she pushed her luggage through LAX.

Sight for sore eyes: Monica Lewinsky looks tired after arriving in Los Angeles following her overseas jaunt

Hiding behind oversized sunglasses, the former White House intern refused to answer questions from waiting media about the rumored presidential aspirations of her one-time nemesis, Hillary Clinton.

Lewinsky has indicated she's ready to move on from her sensational affair with former US President Bill Clinton, and has seized numerous opportunities over the last month to make her mark.

On June 26, Lewinksy cut a stylish figure at the Masterpiece Marie Curie party at the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London.

She
 mingled with stars such as Clive owen, Yasmin Le Bon and Princess 
Beatrice at the event to benefit the Marie Curie Cancer Care charity,  
which provides home nurses to people with terminal cancer.

Days later she was spotted looking slender and stylish at celeb hot spot Little House in London's Mayfair.

The club, a trendy Soho House off-shoot, is members-only which means Lewinsky would have had to be invited by one of the high-profile members.

Lewinsky returned to public life back in May with a revealing article in Vanity Fair in which she opened up about her affair.

'It’s time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress,' she said, poking fun at the infamous '90s attire that she is so closely associated with.

'Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any ‘abuse’ came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position.

'The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor’s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power.'

She also revealed that her decade-long 
silence has come at a cost, as she turned down offers that would've 
amounted to $10 million because she 'didn't feel like the right thing to
 do'.

Monica Lewinsky, who was 22 when she began her affair with the president, has also shared details in a new National Geographic documentary, 'The 90s: The Last Great Decade?'

As part of her return to the spotlight, Lewinky spoke about becoming 'the most humiliated woman in the world' when salacious details of her affair with then-President Bill Clinton emerged.

'That was one of the worst days of my life,' she said. 'I was a virgin to humiliation of that level, until that day... I was the most humiliated woman in the world.'

The timing of Lewinsky's decision to return to the spotlight is interesting, as it coincides with the release of Hillary Clinton's memoir Hard Choices and as speculation as to whether she will run in 2016 ramps up.

Lewinsky says that after laying low when Hillary ran for office in 2008, she's unprepared to put her life on hold for another possibly eight to 10 years.  

'I turned 40 last year, and it is time 
to stop tiptoeing around my past—and other people’s futures. I am 
determined to have a different ending to my story.'

Hillary Clinton says she has 'moved on' from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and wants everyone else to do the same.

The former Secretary of State also revealed she did not read an essay Ms Lewinsky wrote for last month's Vanity Fair magazine that focuses on the scandal that dominated.

In an interview for People magazine in early June, Mrs Clinton said: 'I think everybody needs to look to the future.'

However, Republicans have signaled they don't consider her husband's scandal from the late 1990s out of bounds in the realm of 2016-style political dialogue.

Life-altering: Lewinsky was just 22 when she and then-President Bill Clinton began an affair that would deeply affect both of their futures

Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, a likely GOP presidential contender, answered criticisms of the Republican record on women's issues by saying in January that the last Democratic president engaged in 'predatory behavior' with a woman, Lewinsky, who was 22 when her liaisons with Clinton began in 1995.

Hillary Clinton also refused to confirm or deny calling her a 'narcissistic looney toon' after the affair became public.

Lewinsky says she wants to use her experiences to help others facing public humiliation, citing the tragic death of Tyler Clementi, who killed himself after he was streamed via webcam kissing another man and was ridiculed on social media.

'Perhaps by sharing my story, I reasoned, I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation. The question became: How do I find and give a purpose to my past?' she wrote.

'My current goal is to get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums.'
