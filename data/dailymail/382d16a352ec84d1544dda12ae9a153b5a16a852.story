Anthony McErlean not only faked his own death but had also been claiming pensions relating to his late father-in-law from a previous marriage

Fraudster Anthony McErlean had everything in place to pocket a hefty £520,000 life insurance pay-out.

After faking his own death the pensioner impersonated his wife and claimed he had been knocked down and killed by a cabbage lorry in Honduras.

But, unlike Canoe Man John Darwin, who fooled insurers into making a payout, McErlean didn’t get a penny.

His suspicious insurance company contacted the police – who found the conman’s fingerprints on his own bogus death certificate.

The twice-married former insurance salesman was jailed for six years yesterday after admitting fraud and stealing £68,000 by claiming two pensions in the name of his late father-in-law.

Sentencing McErlean, 66, who has convictions dating back to 1963, judge Adele Williams told him the 'deliberate and calculated fraud’ had been carried out 'to gratify your overweening greed’.

His case at Canterbury Crown Court bears striking similarities to that of John Darwin who faked his demise with wife Anne in a £680,000 insurance swindle before fleeing to Panama.

He and his wife were jailed in 2008 after he reappeared claiming to have lost his memory.

McErlean’s bogus claim was made to Glasgow-based Ace European Insurance in the name of father-of-two McErlean’s Honduran wife Sonya.

The fake witness statement, from a man named Ronald Lodge, recounted the tragic account of how McErlean was killed in December 2009. He was, apparently, knocked over as he tried to change a tyre on his vehicle during a wildlife photography trip in Honduras.

The fake death certificate on which, in a complete giveaway, insurers found McErlean's own fingerprints

The 'witness’ described how farm workers transported McErlean to a small village where local people 'took care of the body’.

The following month insurers received 
documents, reputedly from McErlean’s wife, which included a death 
certificate, police report into the crash and a claim form for the 
conman’s accidental death policy.

At an earlier hearing at Canterbury 
Crown Court prosecutor Donna East said: 'The company expressed some 
suspicions about the claim.’

Detectives found McErlean’s 
fingerprints on the bogus death certificate and matched them to prints 
already held.

The conman had served three and a half years behind bars 
in 1975 for robbery.

He was arrested and during police 
interviews said he 'didn’t want to be destitute in old age’, claiming he
 got into £150,000 worth of debts while looking after his terminally ill
 first wife.

He said his second wife had no knowledge of the scam and that he had obtained the documents by bribing officials in Honduras.

After being charged with fraud earlier
 this year McErlean was freed on strict bail conditions banning him from
 trying to leave the UK. But the day after his release from custody last
 March he applied for a new passport claiming he had lost his last one –
 which had been seized by police.

Detectives intercepted the new passport and re-arrested McErlean several days later.

Lies: The 'witness statement' for Anthony McErlean's scam

McErlean, of Petham, Kent, also 
admitted claiming pensions relating to his late father-in-law from his 
previous marriage, who died in 2007.

The conman’s grown-up son and daughter from his previous marriage only learnt of his scam when he was arrested.

McErlean had previously lived in the village of Dunkirk, near Faversham.

Neighbours there said his first wife Christine died of cancer and he married Sonya Regalado, who was ten years younger than him.

In 2009 they moved to Honduras, where she is still believed to be living. She was not treated as a suspect in the case.

Echoes: The case bears similarities to that of back-from-the-dead John 
Darwin, right, who faked his own death in a canoe accident off Teesside 
in 2002 to help him and his wife Anne, left, claim insurance and pension
 cash
