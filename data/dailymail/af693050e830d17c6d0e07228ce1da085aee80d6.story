An incredible set of photographic negatives showing polar explorer Ernest Shackleton's stay in Captain Scott's Antarctic cabin have been discovered in a hidden dark room 100 years on.

The remarkable find by the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust was made at Cape Evans on the west side of Ross Island, Antarctica, on December 10.

The photographs are from Shackleton's 1914-1917 Ross Sea Party, which spent time living in 
Scott's hut after being stranded on Ross Island when their ship blew out
 to sea.

Remarkable: One of the most striking images is of Ross Sea Party member Alexander Stevens, Ernest Shackleton's Chief Scientist, standing on-board the Aurora

Captain Scott built his headquarters at Cape Evans during the second and ill-fated British Antarctic Expedition from 1910 to 1913 which saw him compete to be the first man to reach the South Pole.

Scott and his party reached the South Pole on January 17 1912 only to find Roald Amundsen's Norwegian expedition had beaten them to it.

He and his four comrades all died from a combination of exhaustion, starvation and extreme cold making the return journey.

Today the expedition's cabin still remains at Cape Evans and the negatives were discovered in expedition photographer Herbert Ponting's darkroom on the site.

Detailed conservation treatment back in New Zealand separating the negatives has revealed twenty-two images.

One of the most striking images is of Ross Sea Party member Alexander Stevens, Shackleton's Chief Scientist, standing on-board the Aurora.

The SY Aurora - originally built in Aberdeen - was formerly a whaling ship before being used for expeditions to the frozen Antartic continent five times because of her reinforced hull to protect against ice.

The New Zealand Antarctic Heritage 
Trust's conservation specialists discovered the clumped together 
cellulose nitrate negatives in a small box as part of the Ross Sea 
Heritage Restoration Project which has seen more than 10,000 objects 
conserved at Scott's Cape Evans hut.

The negatives were removed from Antarctica by the Trust earlier this year.

Although many of the images are damaged, the Antarctic Heritage Trust was able to recognise landmarks around McMurdo Sound, although the identity of the photographer remains unknown.

Nigel Watson, Antarctic Heritage Trust's Executive Director, said: 'It's an exciting find and we are delighted to see them exposed after a century.'

He added: 'It's testament to the dedication and precision of our conservation teams' efforts to save Scott's Cape Evans hut.'

In 2010 the Antarctic Heritage Trust (NZ) discovered three crates of whisky and two crates of brandy under Ernest Shackleton's 1908 base during conservation work.
