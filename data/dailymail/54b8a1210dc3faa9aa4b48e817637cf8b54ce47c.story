Veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke dismissed UKIP supporters as 'grumpy old men'

Veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke has dismissed UKIP as a party full of ‘grumpy old men’ who have had ‘disappointing lives’.

The former Chancellor and Home Secretary said Nigel Farage’s supporters were like a ‘mob’ – blaming the country’s woes on foreigners.

Mr Clarke’s remarks are just the latest bitter attack on the insurgent eurosceptic party following the defection of backbench rebel Mark Reckless on Saturday.

David Cameron accused Mr Reckless of betraying activists who worked to get his ‘fat arse’ on the Commons benches.

The remarks emerged after London Mayor Boris Johnson claimed Tory MPs who left to join UKIP were the type of people who had sex with vacuum cleaners.

Addressing a rally at the party's annual conference in Birmingham last night, Mr Johnson said would-be defectors were the kind of people who might inflict ‘barely credible’ injuries on themselves by ‘vacuum cleaner abuse’.

Less than 24 hours later it emerged his former deputy London mayor Richard Barnes had also defected. 

This week’s vicious attacks on UKIP come despite the Prime Minister admitting that previous attacks on the party had been a mistake.

Mr Cameron said it had been wrong to describe UKIP as a party of ‘fruitcakes and closet racists’. He added: ‘We need to show respect for people who have taken the choice to support this party. And we're going to work really hard to win them back.’

Speaking yesterday afternoon, the Tory former leadership contender David Davis told a meeting designed to address how to tackle the threat from Mr Farage that the Tories ‘should not be insulting people who vote Ukip’.

But just hours later, Mr Clarke launched his assault on UKIP supporters and defectors.

He said he was not ‘the slightest bit surprised’ that Mr Reckless and fellow rebel Douglas Carswell had joined Ukip.

He said: ‘I could never understand why they were not members of Ukip before.’

Mr Clarke likened UKIP supporters to a racist thugs. He said in the aftermath of the great fire of London a ‘mob went through the streets beating up and hanging Frenchman despite all the rumours about a baker shop somewhere in London’.

He added: ‘They were concerned it was French arsonists who caused the problem. UKIP captures the spirit of that.’

He said the insurgent party was ‘largely appealing to the disappointed elderly, the grumpy old men, people who've had a bit of a hard time in life and are a bit disappointed and think the country is going to the dogs and are susceptible to the argument it's all the fault of foreigners’.

Douglas Carswell became the first Conservative to defect to UKIP last month, sparking speculation that up to eight MPs were considering leaving the party

He said Mr Farage had ‘absorbed the BNP vote’ and claimed there was ‘a nasty undertone’ in Mr Farage's party.

The veteran Tory MP said: ‘He does attract elderly male people who have had disappointing lives.’

The Tory party conference has been rocked by recent Tory defections to UKIP which have threatened to overshadow the Conservative leadership’s planned focus on the economy.

While Mr Cameron is resigned to the fact that Mr Carswell, a long-standing Eurosceptic MP, will win the by-election in Clacton, he is furious at Mr Reckless’ ‘betrayal’.

Speaking at several parties and receptions held around the conference in Birmingham, Mr Cameron has become increasingly animated about the way Mr Reckless relied on the support of Conservative activists to get elected.

The Prime Minister argues that committed volunteers have ‘knocked on doors, stuffed envelopes, licked stamps to get his fat arse on the Commons benches, and this is how he repays them’.

At another event Mr Cameron is said to have claimed that if Mr Reckless 'got off his fat arse and worked harder he wouldn't have to defect to UKIP to save his skin'.

The Tory party is expected to mount a huge effort to hold the seat, with local activists lining up to criticise Mr Reckless’ decision to change parties.

Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate a new deal with the EU, clawing back powers from Brussels, before holding an in-out referendum in 2017.

Under pressure from Eurosceptics, Mr Cameron has made clear he will not argue for Britain to remain in the EU if it is not in the national interest.
