An escaped rhea - a six-foot tall flightless bird capable of killing a human with a single blow - gave the police officers the slip again yesterday after almost a year on the run.

The rhea, which is closely related to the ostrich, is believed to be one of three which escaped from a farm in February last year.

The three giant birds, named Mary, Mungo and Midge, escaped from Graham and Julie Fleming's land in Wicken Bonhunt, Essex.

An escaped rhea - a six-foot tall flightless bird capable of killing a human with a single blow - is on the run in Hertfordshire

The flightless bird was reported to the police on Sunday after it was spotted racing through a field, but when police arrived they were unable to catch it

Midge was captured in June last year, but Mary and Mungo remain at large, surviving in the wild for 11 months.

The flightless bird was reported to the police on Sunday after it was spotted racing through a field in Brent Pelham, Hertfordshire.

But when officers arrived they could do little but sit and watch as the bird, which can reach speeds of 40mph, raced past.

East Herts Rural Police tweeted yesterday: 'PC Watson & PCSO Steve have located the rhea, the problem is they can't keep up with it.

'They've some video footage to share, it's very fast.

'We've managed to upload the video, you can just make out the Rhea running from right to left. It's quick.'

It is the second time an escaped rhea has had the police in a flap, after one called Rita escaped from a farm in nearby Clavering, Essex.

Rita - also known locally as Chris Rhea - was on the loose from March until May, when she was shot dead and turned into gourmet sausages.

Mr Fleming said: 'This is one of our original three - Mary, Mungo and Midge - which escaped last February.

'I suggest they are left to live their life and not hounded and shot like the one that escaped last year.

'They are not a danger to the public and pose no greater threat to motorists than deer.'

When Rita was on the run last year, the RSPCA warned the public to stay away from the escaped rhea.

A spokesman said: 'They look nice but they are so strong it's unbelievable. They aren't listed as a dangerous animal but can kill you with one strike of their feet because their claws are six inches long.

'They will also go for your eyes with their beak.' 

The number of rheas bred in farms across the UK has increased in recent years as its meat is very low fat, containing just one per cent fat.

A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'We will become involved if the birds pose a danger to public safety, for example if they went into a road.

'We advise the public not to approach the birds as, like any wild animal, they may become spooked and scared.

'This may cause them to run into a road or cause a danger to others.'

The Common Rhea, also known as Rhea Americana or 'Nandu', is native to South American and often called the South American ostrich.

In the wild, they live in the pampas regions where it is hot in summer and very cold in winter, which means they are ideally suited to the changeable British climate.

They can grow up to six feet tall and weigh up to four stone, with the males being larger than the females. They are omnivores but mainly eat insects, shoots, leaves and grasses.

Rheas have six-inch claws on their feet and large wings that are used in courtship, mating and aggressive displays. Male birds can bite or knock out a person with one blow from their claws, while female rheas are unlikely to be aggressive.

In South America, rheas, which can live for up to 40 years are farmed for their meat, while in the UK they are increasingly popular as pets.
