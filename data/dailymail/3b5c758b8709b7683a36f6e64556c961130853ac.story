Barclays has put aside £500million to pay fines for rigging the foreign currency market, it was announced yesterday.

The high street bank has become the first UK bank to brace itself for a huge penalty over the latest financial scandal.

Royal Bank of Scotland is expected to follow suit today when it announces its results and HSBC is also preparing to make a provision in its results on Monday.

Barclays has put aside £500million to pay fines for rigging the foreign currency market it has been announced 

The measures follow investigations launched last year by regulators in the United States, Asia and Europe.

They were looking into whether traders conspired to fix the unregulated ‘FX’ foreign exchange market by rigging rates used when buying and selling currencies.

The Serious Fraud Office has also launched a criminal investigation in Britain.

Of the £500million provision, Barclays finance chief Tushar Morzaria said: ‘Based on our ongoing discussions with agencies, this is the best estimate of what we will need.’ 

The revelation came as the bank announced £3.7billion profits for the first nine months of the year. It is also setting aside another £170million to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance, taking its total bill for the scandal so far to more than £5billion.

The initial FX fine is expected to come from UK and US regulators and is likely to dwarf the £290million Barclays paid in 2012 for rigging inter-bank Libor interest rates. 

The Financial Conduct Authority could announce penalties for several banks simultaneously within weeks.

Last night Labour’s Chris Leslie, Shadow Treasury minister, said: ‘When will this all end? The UK’s banks really are drinking at the last chance saloon if they want to win back the public’s trust as it is at rock bottom.’

The Bank of England has said that more could have been done to punish traders following 'an appalling cases of misconduct' over the years 

It is thought City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority could make an announcement within weeks, and is likely to announce penalties for several banks simultaneously.

Banks buy and sell foreign currency on behalf of clients but traders can also bet on whether a currency will move up or down.

The probe centres on claims that bank staff are making foreign currency trades before processing customers’ orders.

Martin Wheatley, the FCA’s chief executive, has previously warned the foreign exchange allegations are ‘every bit as bad as they have been with Libor’.

The foreign currency market is the biggest financial market in the world, with more than £3 trillion changing hands every day.

But despite this it is not regulated, with whistleblowers who first exposed the scandal comparing the market to the ‘Wild West’.

Banks including Barclays, RBS and Lloyds have already been fined for rigging the London Interbank Offered Rate - or Libor - a benchmark used to set trillions of pounds of financial contracts including the price of mortgages.

Barclays has also been fined £26million for rigging gold prices and is fighting a £300million penalty in the US for manipulating energy markets.

The Government has made rigging Libor interest rates a criminal offence carrying a maximum jail sentence of seven years. 

It wants to extend these powers to cover other markets, including foreign exchange and commoditites such as oil and gold.

US lender JPMorgan, Swiss giant UBS and Germany’s Deutsche Bank have each recently set aside more than $1 billion - £625million - in the third quarter for extra legal costs, which is thought to mainly cover potential fines relating to currency market investigations.

Earlier this week the woman charged with cleaning up the City of London launched a stinging attack on ‘outrageous’ behaviour in the financial markets.

Dr Nemat Shafik, one of four deputy governors at the Bank of England, said more could be done to punish traders following ‘a series of appalling cases of misconduct’ over recent years.
