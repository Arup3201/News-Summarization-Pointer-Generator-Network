I got married to my beautiful girlfriend Vivian in Monaco last week and it was a wonderful experience. I wasn't sure if I would feel anxious about the occasion, but it was such a pleasure.

There was only a small group of friends and family, it was quite intimate – and we all went to a beach restaurant after the ceremony and we continued the celebrations there. It was an awesome day, very emotional and it just felt right.

Only 48 hours later, Germany then faced Argentina in the World Cup final. I watched the game with my family at my parents' house in Monaco.

It was such an intense match, and it 
really could have gone either way. In the end, the Germans did it when 
Mario Gotze scored with just seven minutes of extra-time remaining. It 
was so, so awesome. I went crazy in the apartment when we scored and it 
was a great experience, one that I will always remember.

It was well deserved because Germany were the best team at the 
tournament. I came home to Germany on Tuesday so I followed their 
celebrations with the bus going through Berlin; there were some great 
pictures and great energy. 

The whole team were fantastic throughout the tournament. Some players 
were better in some matches and some in other games, so everyone 
contributed.

On Wednesday, it was announced that I've agreed a new contract with Mercedes, and I am very proud to have 
signed a new deal with, for me, the most special team in Formula One.

I
 am a German driver at a German team, and I am so proud to continue the 
history of the Silver Arrows.

It is great  that we are dominating the 
sport, we are the best team, and I am grateful for the trust that Toto 
Wolff, Paddy Lowe and everyone else have shown in me.

The discussions 
about my new deal started a long time ago because most of us had great 
interest in continuing what has been a successful relationship. The 
process was an on-going one, but it was always relaxed and the time had 
come to solidify and announce the deal.

This is the place where I want 
to be. I feel very much at home here, and they have shown a lot of faith
 and respect in me and it is a great collaboration, so I am looking 
forward to many more successful years with the team.

I am also enjoying
 the moment, because is special knowing that if I do a good job at each 
race I can be on pole and if I do a good job on Sunday I will win the 
grand prix. It doesn't get better than that.

This week is my second 
home race – the German Grand Prix – and it would round off an incredible
 week if I could win on Sunday.

So, that is the mission and I am looking
 forward to completing it.  I am also looking forward to receiving the 
support from the home fans which will be great.

This race is special 
because I know so many people are supporting us, and I am in the 
fortunate position where I have two home races – in Monaco and 
Hockenheim.

In response to Lewis' comments about my nationality, I 
don't really read the press, but I got a jist of what he said. I am very
 much laid back about it, and I understand it was a joke from Lewis 
rather than something serious.

I am easy going and I don't have any 
problems with such opinions and that is all I really have to say on the 
matter.

The atmosphere last time out at the British Grand Prix was 
amazing. The fans were obviously there to support Lewis, but everybody 
gave me the respect as well and even I could enjoy what was a brilliant 
occasion, despite my own personal result.

Unfortunately my gearbox 
broke during the race and Lewis went on to win. Naturally, there was 
then a lot of interest in whether I would have won the race had I not 
suffered my first DNF of the season.

It is impossible to say but let us 
give the benefit to the guy who was leading. I was doing well at the 
time, so I was pretty confident I could have made it happen and stayed 
out in front.

The early part of the race was red flagged for one hour 
following Kimi Raikkonen's huge shunt. I just tried to chill out; I also
 went to see Vivian and my friends and discuss the re-start with my 
team.

On Kimi's crash, it was certainly a big one, but it is difficult 
to comment on it. There was a bump off the track which he hit and it is 
difficult to foresee those sort of things so I can't really judge 
whether he could have avoided it or not.

I saw that his wheel narrowly 
missed Max Chilton's helmet and I am sure we will have to discuss the 
idea of closed-cockpit racing with the GPDA at some point in the near future. 

Wreck: Kimi Raikkonen was fortunate to avoid any major injury following his first-lap crash at the British GP

Retirement: Rosberg suffered his first DNF of the year at Silverstone. He leads the championship by four points

Nico Rosberg's fee for his column will
