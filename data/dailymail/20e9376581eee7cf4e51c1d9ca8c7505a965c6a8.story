After Jennifer Lawrence, Pamela Anderson, Jennifer Hudson and Glee's Kristin Chenoweth chopped their locks into a pixie cut, women everywhere took notice.

According to new statistics from Yahoo!, released on Wednesday, searches for the phrase 'pixie haircut' are 511 times higher than what they were this time last year.

'It seems like a woman in #Hollywood gets
 a pixie cut everyday! This month on @Yahoo, searches for [pixie 
haircut] are spiking off the charts,' tweeted Yahoo Search Data.

Boy meets girl: Jennifer Lawrence and Pamela Anderson both chopped their hair just days apart last week

Top searched celebrities this month include Pamela Anderson, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jennifer Aniston, even though the former Friends star's recent chop was bob-length, not pixie length.

Miss Lawrence, 23, cut her hair into a voluminous shoulder length style earlier this year after sporting long locks for some time. But she went even shorter, revealing her new pixie crop last Wednesday on Facebook.

She was then seen showing off her new 'do as she appeared on a Hunger Games: Catching Fire - Global Google+ Hangout Q&A, which was streamed live on Google.

She admitted that the decision to cut her hair was due to it being 'fried from being dyed so much.' 

Meanwhile former Baywatch star and 
Playboy model Pamela Anderson explained the reason for her chic new 
pixie cut to chat show host Ellen Degeneres.

'I got a haircut,' she explained last week, a few days after running the New York City marathon to raise money for charity.

'I just thought my hair had had a life and I kind of wanted to put that behind me and start fresh,' the 46-year-old replied. 'And I also thought it would be good for the marathon.'

Jennifer Hudson also hopped aboard the increasingly popular pixie cut trend.

The singer and actress said she 'wanted a change, something different and it’s grown and sexy,' she told Hollywood Access at the unveiling of her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Wednesday.

'It’s just like, this is the new JHud, Jennifer! I said if I’m gonna go short, I’m gonna go all the way… and here it is.'

Robin Wright, 46, has also embraced the boyish look, which has also been favored by stars like Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams, Pixie Geldof, Miley Cyrus and Coco Rocha.

Miss Rocha, who chopped off her fiery red hair in August, revealed that Tilda Swinton helped her take a risk at trying a new, short hairstyle.

'Short hair, for some reason in our industry everyone gets nervous when a model does that, because it means she only has one look,' the 25-year-old told Vanity Fair. 'Tilda, I thought, could really change things up. She can be boyish, she can be feminine, she can be sexy, she can be cute.'
