He won his battle against throat cancer more than ten years ago.

Now Geoffrey Boycott has revealed his strategy for preventing the illness reappearing – taking 16 different vitamins and supplements every day.

The veteran England cricketer, 73, said yesterday he had researched online different foods and supplements which are known to help combat cancer.

His new regime, which includes taking garlic, carcumin and echinacea tablets, has also seen him give up sugar and dairy products.

Cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott, centre, with his partner Rachel, right and daughter Emma, left, said he now takes 16 different vitamins every day in order to stop his throat cancer from returning 

He revealed he now only drinks green tea, after discovering research suggesting that milk can hasten the return of cancer.

Boycott was diagnosed with cancer in 2002 but after a gruelling spell of radiation treatment, he went into remission.

Speaking yesterday at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, said he had also tried alternative therapies, including Feng Sui and visiting a medium.

And the famously grumpy commentator said that surviving cancer has made him feel less cross – because the illness has put things into perspective.

Boycott, who was awarded OBE after his retirement from his international career in 1982, was at first reluctant to talk openly about his illness after his diagnosis.

But yesterday, the Test Match Special commentator said he wanted to inspire other people with his new book about his experiences, The Corridor of Certainty.

He said: ‘There’s a lot of knowledge out there that you’re not being given that can help people to stay alive.

‘I take 16 tablets a day of various vitamins. Echinacea, omega fish oils, garlic, carcumin, all sorts of things like that. I’ve been taking them for 12 years.

As well as taking vitamins, the former cricketer, pictured, said he now drinks green tea and avoids milk

‘I eat whatever. But I watch what I eat in terms of I’m aware, which many people aren’t and I wasn’t before, that cancer loves sugar. Get rid of sugar. Also get rid of dairy – not good for you.

‘I drink a lot of green tea. I used to be a tea drinker but now I drink a lot of green tea because it has no milk.

‘But other than that, I eat normal fish, meat, what have you.’

Told by one audience member that he looked amazing, he quipped: ‘Really? Well I’ve got a chance with Kim Basinger then. She was 60 at Christmas, so she’ll be just right for me.’

He added that when he was diagnosed with cancer, he was ready to try anything – leading him to alternative therapies.

‘There are things in life that we don’t totally understand,’ he added. ‘And I always felt that China is the oldest civilisation in the whole world.

‘I went to a medium. I was open to Feng Shui. If you’re going to die, I’m receptive to anything and I think you have to be.’

He said recounted how, at the height of the illness, he had burn pads on his neck because of the radiation and was dosed up with morphine.

Boycott said he regularly researched different foods and supplements on the internet 

He said his wife Margaret Rachel Swinglehurst, acted as a ‘buddy’ to ‘frighten’ him into eating well and taking his meditation.

After all the trauma of his illness, he said he has mellowed in comparison to his days on the cricket pitch.

‘People around me say it has changed me,’ he said. ‘I don’t think it can change what you’re born with, your DNA. But it can have a rounding off of the edges.

‘I do see things differently. When I get cross and I swear, I stop then I think, hang on – no point.

‘In the big picture, I’ve had 12 years and I might have been dead – some people are. It teaches you to look forward and say “hey, come on, it’s not really that important.”

‘Just get over it quicker. Sometimes I don’t get as cross as I did.’
