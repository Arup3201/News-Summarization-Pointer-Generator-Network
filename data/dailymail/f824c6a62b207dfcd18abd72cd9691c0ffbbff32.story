A man who collapsed unconscious in the street was stripped of his valuables by a passing crowd. 

CCTV footage showed several men and women rifling through the man's pockets as he lay on the ground instead of calling emergency services.

Sergio Palacios, 38, staggered from La Dolce Vita bar in Port Chester, New York at around 2.30am on Sunday and fell over on the sidewalk.

A crowd leaving the bars gathered around the man but instead of helping him, they removed his wallet, watch, chain, belt and shoes in full view of security cameras.

One woman unclipped the chain from around the man's neck before holding it up to examine it.

A man took Mr Palacios' watch before another pulls off his shoes and shakes them out to see if there is any money stashed there. One individual even takes his belt.

After a local resident Sean McNerney spotted the attack and called the police, the gang fled. 

Mr McNerney told CBS: 'This poor man … nobody knows if he’s sick. Nobody knows if he’s hurt.'

Another resident George Bolger: 'It’s not uncommon to find people drunk under cars rolled for their money.'

Mr Palacios regained consciousness around 6am when he wandered into a backyard. A frightened resident called the police and he was arrested for trespassing.

Port Chester police were examining the CCTV for suspects and said the charges against Mr Palacios may be dropped.
