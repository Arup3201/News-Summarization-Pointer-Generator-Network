A New Mexico town is covered in 8 to 9-foot piles of tumbleweed thanks to days of high desert winds blowing in the roaming bushes.

Homeowners in Clovis say the tumbleweeds just started flowing in on Sunday like 'herds of cow' and have since buried homes and even trapped residents in their houses.

Even longtime Clovis residents say they've never seen anything like it.

Trapped! Tumbleweeds began blowing into Clovis, New Mexico Sunday night and the onslaught went on for days

Otherworldly: The tumbleweeds became some thick that residents began calling it an invasion

"[We] couldn't get out of the garage,' Eddie Ward told KRQE. 'We've lived here 23 years and never seen this. So it's pretty crazy.

Ward and his mother were among the dumbfounded residents of Clovis who woke up Monday morning to the mountains of Salsola iberica, or Russian thistle.

The noxious invader that arrived from the Eurasion steppe in the 1800's is now common weed throughout the West.

Too common if you ask Lee Cassidy of Clovis.

Trapped: Some people became trapped inside their homes and had to call 911

Tumbleweeds AKA Russian Thistle AKA Salsola iberica is native not to the barren American West, but to the frigid steppe of central Asia.

The tumbleweeds hitched a ride with settlers, likely landing somewhere in the Dakotas prior to the 1880s.

The tenacious plant, which saps water from already parched lands and has few if any uses, quickly became ubiquitous in the central western states.

The largest specimens can grow as large as a Volkswagen Beetle.

Each winter when the plants dry up and die, the break off their stems and roll away with the winds to spread their nefarious seeds, hundreds of thousands of them, for miles around.

'It looked like a herd of cows coming,' she said of the invasion. 'The tumbleweeds were just rolling in.'

'We tried to get out of the house and front and back door was both covered with tumbleweeds and we couldn't get out,' Wilford Ransom said.

Unsure what to do, he called 911.

'The lady asked what was the emergency and I told her we were covered with tumbleweeds,' he said.

Though it sounds funny, the tumbleweeds are no laughing matter.

City crews from Clovis quickly began 
the Herculean task of removing the thousands of tumbleweeds that just 
keep doing what they do best and rolling away.

And
 with each recurring bout with high desert winds, Clovis was dealt 
another prickly, dead brown blow from their tumbling invaders.

The
 city of Clovis told KOB that workers would be around town with dump 
trucks and excavators through the end of the week trying to clean up the
 unprecedented mess.

But that's just on public property. The city can't go into years to help rid residents of tumbleweeds.

And that has many folks in Clovis fearing the nuisance nettles might be around for quite some time.

The cleanup began shortly after the invasion but renewed desert winds kept sending more weeds flying into town

Herculean: The city sent out men, trucks, and heavy machinery, but the task before them was daunting

Private problem: Crews did what they could to remove the weeds from public land, but there was nothing they could do for homes inundated with the prickly plant
