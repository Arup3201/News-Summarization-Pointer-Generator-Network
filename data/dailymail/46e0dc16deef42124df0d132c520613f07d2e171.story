A Thai AirAsia flight to eastern China was forced to return to Bangkok after an unruly passenger threw a cup of hot water and noodles at a flight attendant.

The budget airline said a Chinese passenger berated the woman before scalding her with water on a charter flight to Nanjing on Thursday night.

Colleagues administered first aid while the plane returned to Bangkok, where the female passenger and her entourage of three people were kicked off the flight.

Chinese media reported that instant noodles were thrown at the flight attendant along with the hot water.

A video obtained by China National Radio shows a man standing up in the cabin and making a threat to bomb the plane.

The airline’s statement said the captain and the crew invited the female passenger to discuss the situation at the airport and they reached ‘an amicable conclusion.’

Thai AirAsia did not say if the four passengers were allowed back on the plane when it departed again, almost five hours after its original departure.

Incidents involving Chinese tourists making angry outbursts have prompted Beijing to issue stern guidelines on behaving abroad.

In February, according to Thai and Chinese news reports, 27 members of a Chinese tour group were ejected from a China Eastern Airlines flight before take-off from the Thai resort island of Phuket after brawling over seating arrangements.

Chinese visitors represent the biggest share of tourist arrivals in Thailand.
