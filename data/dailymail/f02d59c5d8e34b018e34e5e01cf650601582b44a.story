Astronauts may soon be able to ditch the freeze-dried meals for fresh fruit and veg grown in space.

A team of Russian 'space farmers' have successfully grown, and harvested, a vegetable patch on board the International Space Station (ISS).

The harvest, which includes Japanese leafy greens, dwarf wheat and peas, has now also been verified as safe to eat.

In August 2007, the STS-118 space shuttle mission launched into space with 10 million cinnamon basil seeds.

The
 majority of the seeds were returned to Earth for students to grow in 
plant growth chambers they designed, but 16 seeds were left behind on 
the International Space Station for an in-orbit experiment.

Flight Engineer Clayton Anderson documented the plants' 
growth by photographing the plants inside the chambers every other day 
for nearly three weeks.

Then, in 2010, Nasa scientists sent flowers to the ISS to see if roots could grow in weightless environment.

Seeds
 of the flower Arabidopsis thaliana germinated onboard the station and 
sprouted roots in the same way they do on Earth – leaving the seed in 
search of nutrients in the soil - therefore proving gravity isn’t 
needed.

Currently, all food used by astronauts is flown to the ISS on resupply missions periodically throughout the year.

This latest breakthrough in space farming could mean that astronauts could become self-sufficient, growing their own food during long-duration missions.

It would also save money in resupplying missions, and in fuel because the launch weight of each mission would be lower.

The next step is to sow rice, tomatoes and bell peppers after repairing the station’s Lada greenhouse.

Margarita Levinskikh, a researcher at the Institute of Biomedical Problems told an annual space conference in Moscow: 'The experiments with peas have been very promising’ and added the seeds produced were of ‘extraordinary quality.'

Researchers are also planning to grow a special grass species called purple false brome.

Scientists have already sequenced the 
genome of this grass and the space farmers plan to use this sequencing 
to look for any genetic abnormalities that may have been caused by 
growing in space.

This 
isn’t the first time plants have been grown in space. In August 2007, the
 STS-118 space shuttle mission launched into space with 10 million 
cinnamon basil seeds.

The Lunar Plant Growth Habitat team is constructing a small technology demonstration unit (illustrated right) to study germination of plants (mock-up pictured left) in lunar gravity and radiation on the moon. The experiment will hint at whether humans could one day live there

Aside from food, plants can also use 
the carbon dioxide exhaled by the astronauts and be used to recycle human waste into food.

Astronauts can already drink water distilled from sweat and urine.

Nasa is also planning to see if humans could live on the moon by seeing if plants can be grown in a lunar environment.

The
 U.S. space agency plans on sowing its first seeds in specially designed
 canisters containing everything that is needed for the seedlings to 
thrive, that it will send to the moon in 2015.

A
 group of scientists, students and volunteers - known as the Lunar Plant
 Growth Habitat team - are constructing a small unit to study the 
germination of plants when exposed to lunar gravity and radiation.
