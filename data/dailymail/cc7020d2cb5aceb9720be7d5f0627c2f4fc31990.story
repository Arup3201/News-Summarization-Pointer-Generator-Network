A bogus Good Samaritan who comforted a terrified betting shop worker after she was robbed by a man wielding an axe has been jailed for six years because he had planned the attack.

Alexander Millar received a £100 'public spirit' reward from Ladbrokes for calling the police and caring for the female manager during the raid at the shop in Ann’s Terrace, Darlington.

But detectives later discovered the 21-year-old was 'up to his neck in' the plot with housemate Shane Lowther, 23, who burst in wearing a balaclava and waving a weapon on September 16 last year.

Duplicitous: Alexander Millar, 21, left, received a £100 voucher from Ladbrokes for comforting the female manager after a robbery - but it emerged he planned it with his friend Shane Lowther, 23, right

Both men were jailed for the robbery at Teesside Crown Court yesterday with Recorder James Brown telling the pair he held them equally responsible.

Adrian Dent, prosecuting, said Millar 'gave the appearance of being a customer - he regularly frequented betting shops.

'All of a sudden Lowther came into the premises wearing a balaclava, wielding an axe and carrying a bag.

'He told the manager to put the money in the bag - she was extremely frightened.'

The manager believed Millar was there to place a bet and asked him not to leave her as she filled the bag with cash totalling £475 and gave it to Lowther.

As she pressed the panic button, Lowther shouted to Millar to hold the shop door to stop it from locking shut automatically.

Mr Dent said Millar stayed with the manager and called the police for her before giving his name and address to officers.

He later returned to the shop that night to claim £134 he had won on a gaming machine before the robbery.

Scam: Lowther rushed into this bookies in Darlington with his face covered and wielding an axe - but his friend was already waiting and pretended to be a customer afterwards

The court heard how he was later given £100 in vouchers by Ladbrokes for being 'so public spirited'.

Lowther was arrested after he confessed to family members and they reported him.

Millar claimed he was not involved, but he was convicted after a jury heard the men shared a house in Gladstone Street, Darlington.

The court heard how both men have numerous previous convictions.

In 2010, Millar was sent to a young offenders’ institution for 18 months for his part in a failed brothel scam.

The defendant and a female accomplice planned to rob a punter who had replied to an advert in a national newspaper.

But Millar was left bloodied and in tears when the man they tried to trick turned out to be a burly soldier.

John Turner, defending Millar, said his client had largely addressed a drugs problem but still had a gambling problem which had left him with large debts.

Sentencing: The two men were jailed for a total of ten years at Teesside Crown Court as they were equally responsible, the judge said

Stephen Andrews, defending Lowther, said the defendant had written a letter of apology to the shop manager.

Mr Andrews said: 'He knows exactly what he did - the seriousness of the situation is not lost on him.'

Millar was sentenced to six years in prison while Lowther, who was given credit for his guilty plea, was jailed for four years.

Recorder James Brown told Millar: 'It was particularly disgraceful that you pretended to be a good Samaritan when in reality you were fully involved and up to your neck in the scheme yourself.'

Speaking to both men Recorder Brown said: 'You can be under no illusion that this was a very serious offence committed against a vulnerable target.'
