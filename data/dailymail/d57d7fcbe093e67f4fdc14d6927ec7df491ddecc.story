Distressed: Frances King,  headmistress of Roedean School in Sussex, is leaving because of the pervading negative attitude towards private schools in the UK

The headmistress of a leading independent school for girls condemned hostile attitudes to private education yesterday as she revealed she is quitting Britain for a job abroad.

Frances King, head of Roedean for five years, said she was fed up with being ‘always on the negative side of public opinion’.

Private schools had been through a ‘bruising time’ and the Government ‘cannot afford to be supportive’, she claimed.

Mrs King will leave the UK to become director of an international school in Switzerland – Collège Alpin Beau Soleil – in the summer. She said she found it ‘quite hard work’ working against a tide of disapproval in Britain.

While UK private education was increasingly sought-after among overseas parents, Britain itself was unable to celebrate its success and heritage, she warned.

‘It is quite hard work to continue to be always on the negative side of public opinion,’ said Mrs King who became head of Roedean, in East Sussex, in 2008.

She added that Roedean was ‘making sure we have got a good amount of money put into bursaries and, as much as we can afford in our situation, we are trying to ensure widening access’.

The school was also staying focused on its core purpose of providing ‘top quality education’, she said, but it was ‘hard work’ pursuing this in the face of national disapproval.

Fellow headmistress Vicky Tuck expressed similar sentiments when she left Cheltenham Ladies’ College for a school in Switzerland in 2011. She said she was made to feel ‘slightly immoral’ for running a fee-paying school.

‘There are things about England and British education that are quite irksome – you have constantly to defend independent education,’ Mrs Tuck said at the time. ‘Many of us in the independent sector work very hard and feel at times we have to apologise for what we’re doing.’

Grand: Schools like Roedean should be celebrated for the quality of their education not castigated just because they are private, Mrs King says

Roedean School, on the outskirts of Brighton, has been one of Britain's leading girls schools ever since it was founded in 1885.

Boarders pay more than £31,000 a year for the privilege of studying there, while the fees are around £18,000 for day girls.

The school boasts an indoor swimming pool, a theatre, 15 tennis courts and a chapel.

Its distinguished alumnae include pioneering nurse Dame Cicely Saunders, creator of the 'A to Z' Phyllis Pearsall, and Ursula Graham Bower, an anthropologist who became a guerilla warrior fighting against the Japanese invasion of Burma.

Anthony Seldon, master of Wellington 
College, warned last week that private school pupils were beginning to 
feel the effects of a ‘hatred that dare not speak its name’.

He criticised ‘jealousy and hostility’
 towards independent schools and warned that public school pupils were 
being ‘discriminated against at the final hurdle’ when they sent off 
their university applications.

Mr Seldon said there were 62 pupils at
 Wellington bright enough to get an Oxbridge interview this year, but he
 expected only 20 offers of places.

At Roedean, where fees for boarders 
are up to £31,350 a year, half of pupils are now from overseas.

Oxford-educated Mrs King, who was 
previously head of Heathfield School for Girls, Ascot, said some 
boarding schools in Britain were a throwback to the days of the British 
Empire, when children were sent home to be educated.

She told the Times: ‘They are still 
struggling on. There was a boom period when local British people decided
 that boarding was just the best thing; that is now changing, perfectly 
reasonably – you want your child at home.’

Strong schools such as Roedean would continue to thrive but others would ‘find the market too tough’.
