Roy 'Murph' Guest, 51, from Stafford, has been fired from his paramedic job after writing vile messages about NHS campaigner Julie Bailey

A paramedic who sent grotesque hate messages to the founder of an NHS campaign group has been sacked.

Roy 'Murph' Guest, 51, posted a string
of vile comments on Facebook about Julie Bailey, 51, after she set up 
the Cure the NHS campaign to highlight failings at scandal-hit Stafford 
Hospital, where her mother died in 2007.

Today it emerged that Guest, who in
one message said he hoped Mrs Bailey would suffer a 'life-threatening 
illness', had been fired from his post as senior paramedic with West
Midlands Ambulance Service.

Guest, who was initially suspended while an internal investigation was carried out, has now been sacked, and faces being struck off after
being referred to the Health and Care Professions Council (HPC) on 
charges of serious professional misconduct.

A spokesman for West Midlands 
Ambulance Service said: 'We can confirm that, following a formal 
investigation into comments made on Facebook, a member of staff has been
dismissed.

'The case has also been referred to the Health and Care Professions Council.'

In February Guest - who said he had 
received treatment at the hospital for a collapsed lung, broken ribs and
pneumonia - launched a vicious attack on Ms Bailey, who runs a cafe 
in Stafford.

In a hate-filled rant, he wrote: 'Julie Bailey, I hope you suffer a life threatening illness at night 
where you have to travel furthur [sic] than you should do because your 
local hospital is closed (your fault).

'Serves you right, go back to yer 
bacon butties girl and leave the staff alone, they are the heart of OUR 
hospital and do a brilliant job, under extreme circumstances, just shut 
yer face and leave them alone now, you've done enough damage, stick 
together girlies, i for one am behind you 1000 per cent.

'Don't let these sad people grind you down, she's the owner of a ******* cafe for **** sake.'

In another entry he wrote: 'This woman
was singlehandedly to blame for all this media pressure and negative 
comments about the hospital....she couldn't care less, money springs to 
mind.'

In March Staffordshire Police said 
that Guest would not be charged after officers deemed his comments did 
not cross the threshold for criminal charges.

Astonishing rant: The senior West Midlands Ambulance Service worker said on a Facebook group in support of staff at Stafford Hospital that Miss Bailey, 51, should 'shut her face' and 'go back to her bacon butties'

A spokesperson said: 'After reviewing 
all of the information available to us, and taking into consideration 
national guidance, it was decided that the comments do not meet the 
threshold for criminal charges.

'We have been liaising with Julie Bailey throughout the investigation and updated her about its outcome.'

Ms Bailey set up Cure the NHS to 
campaign for an investigation into Mid Staffordshire NHS trust which 
later found up to 1,200 patients had died needlessly.

Following the harrowing death of her mother, Bella, at the hospital, Ms Bailey vowed to bring those responsible to account.

After the investigation into Guest's comments was launched earlier this year, mother-of-two Ms Bailey said: ‘It has been the same for five years now, it’s the same as the threats I have always had hoping that I get some kind of disease.

‘These people need to be rooted out, they are just the kind of bully who works for the NHS.

‘I have had a great response from lots of NHS staff, overworked staff have written to me to thank us for our hard work.’

Mr Guest, 54, made the threats even though his mother Irene died at the trust in 2008 having suffered from dementia.

His father, Jeff, 82, a member of Cure the NHS, said she was never bathed, not properly fed and was left to lie in soiled sheets.

Mr Guest – whose wife Claire, 54, is a nurse at the trust –  apologised and removed the comments from Facebook after he was hauled up for making them.

In February he said: ‘I’m a healthcare professional.

'I’ve apologised for my comments on Facebook and I’ve removed the comments.’

Mrs Bailey set up Cure the NHS in an attempt to bring those responsible to justice after witnessing appalling treatment when her mother Bella was admitted to the hospital in 2007.

She wrote to the Healthcare Commission and campaigned with other relatives of patients.
