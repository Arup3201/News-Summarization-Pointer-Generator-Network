Roma hero Francesco Totti has taunted Manchester City after they tweeted about his failure to score on nine previous visits to England.

The legendary Italian ended that run when he claimed his side’s equaliser in a 1-1 Champions League draw at the Etihad on Tuesday night, becoming the oldest scorer in the history of the competition at the age of 38 years and 3 days.

Before the game, City wrote on their official Twitter account: ‘We’re looking forward to hosting you @OfficialASRoma, and a legendary player such as Totti. He’s never scored in England, has he? #CityvRoma’

Roma replied: ‘You’re right, @MCFC. Our Capitano has never scored in England. But there’s always a first time for everything... #CityvRoma’

Totti raced clear to equalise with his 300th career goal in the 23rd minute, leaving City with just a solitary point from their opening two Group E games and facing a real struggle to qualify for the knockout stage.

Afterwards, Totti said: ‘City’s tweet? It really brought me luck. It was a beautiful goal and a good performance.

‘I really wanted to score as soon as possible as I had not found the back of the net this season.

‘But above all, I am thrilled for my team because we have shown a lot of strength, which was not easy.

‘After the group was drawn, few people gave us any hope of doing well. But we have proved that we can play against any team. We have shown we are strong and competitive and we fear no-one.’

Totti replaces Ryan Giggs as the competition’s oldest scorer. The Manchester United star held the old record at 37 years 289 days.

‘It really wasn’t something I was thinking of when I was on the pitch,’ said Totto, who had failed to score in nine European games in England stretching back to November 1998. ‘Records arrive thanks to the help of your team-mates and what really matters is the result of the team. My main focus is on the team and not on myself.’
