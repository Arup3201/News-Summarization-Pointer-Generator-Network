A schoolgirl who went to court to claim her right to die only to have a change of heart has celebrated her 16th birthday and gone to her secondary school prom.

Her decision stunned the world when she calmly stated she would rather die than undergo more hospital trauma and simply wanted to live her last days in peace.

But Hannah's condition deteriorated and aged 14, having changed her mind, she underwent a transplant at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

She has now just celebrated her 16th birthday, done her GCSEs and enjoyed her school prom as a happy and healthy teenager looking forward to a future.

Prom: Hannah Jones dressed up for her high school dance

Hannah, who lives in Ross-On-Wye, Herefordshire, said: 'I never thought I'd celebrate my 16th, do my GCSEs or be picking a dress for my high school prom.

'Although people thought I was too young to decide, I'd been through so much I felt I had the right.

'But everyone's entitled to change their mind and now I'm so glad I did.’

The
 teenager was celebrating her 14th birthday in April 2009 when her 
kidneys failed - with her deterioration acting as a catalyst for change.

She said: 'I was obviously ill, but just thought I'd overdone it on my birthday.

'Actually, it turned out it was my kidneys failing and that's when the reality of the situation hit home.

'I love my friends and family so much and I wanted to reach adulthood, have a family, and have a career.

'I wasn't so sure anymore that I was ready to leave all that behind.

Hannah told her mum she wanted transplant who called the doctor to inform them of her decision.

However, there was a setback in July 
2009 when the first heart found wasn't a match.

But days later a 
matching heart became available and Hannah underwent a successful 
transplant.

Since the 
operation, the teenager is enjoying a new lease of life having has been 
to Glastonbury, completed her GCSEs and celebrated her 16th birthday.

Although she does still have to take a cocktail of 12 tablets a day Hannah said she is enjoying a new lease of life.

She added: 'Having a new heart is brilliant because I've got so much energy - I can run for ages and visit my three ponies.

‘My scar isn't even that bad, and no one can see it if I wear a top with a high neck.

'I feel more mature than my friends and see things differently to them.

'I don't care about hairstyles and make-up, I'm just happy I'm healthy. I'm an upbeat person and I don't like to feel sad so I try not to dwell on it

'Having a new heart is brilliant because I've got so much energy. For the first time ever, I can do what all my friends are doing.

'I try not to think too much and instead just live for every minute; I mean I start college in September, how cool is that?

Dreams: Before her heart transplant two years ago Hannah Jones asked to see Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida

'My dream is to one day meet JLS and work either on TV or as a lawyer - but I haven't decided which yet.'

Hannah had battled with leukaemia from the age of four and underwent dozens of gruelling medical treatments for the next ten years.

When doctors told her she needed a new heart she refused - causing outrage and controversy across the world.

Mum Kirsty said: 'I'm so proud of Hannah, when I saw her looking so beautiful in her dress I had a tear in my eye.

'We've had a rollercoaster of a journey and we're now looking forward to the next chapter.' 

Suffering: Hannah Jones had been in and out of hospitals for eight years when she made her decision to refuse a heart transplant
