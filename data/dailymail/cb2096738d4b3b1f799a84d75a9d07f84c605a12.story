The pilots who averted a near-miss crash at Barcelona airport have revealed the shocking moment the air traffic controller ‘went silent’ as another plane taxied in front of them on the runway.

Nikolay Limarev, the captain of the UTair Boeing 767, which was carrying 260 passengers, was forced to perform an emergency ‘go-around’ procedure to avoid hitting the Aerolineas Argentinas Airbus A340 at El Prat Airport in Spain.

Limarev admitted the incident ‘could have been serious’ if it had not been a clear day.

He also said the air traffic controller was 'silent' at the key moment, which meant he pulled the plane up without waiting for instructions from the ground.The air traffic controller apologised afterwards for the ‘failure’.

The dramatic moment was captured on video and posted on YouTube where it has had more than eight million views in just two days.

It shows the Boeing coming in to land on the runway, making its final approach, as the Airbus, getting ready for a flight to Buenos Aires, taxis across its path.

The Boeing is forced to abort the landing, with the pilot carrying out an emergency 'go-around' procedure.

The jet, which had travelled from Russia, landed safely shortly afterwards.

Co-pilot Kirill Kuzmin told how they heard air traffic control instruct the Argentine aircraft to wait for the UTair aircraft to land before crossing the runway - and also heard the crew of the Airbus acknowledge the order, which they then defied.

He told The Siberian Times: ‘Before getting close to the runway we heard the air traffic controller's command allowing Argentinians to cross the runway after we had landed.

‘The Argentinians repeated the comment which meant that they heard and accepted it.

‘But then suddenly - and without a clear reason - the Argentinians got onto the runway just as our altitude was going below 100 metres.’

At this point, ‘the air traffic controller clearly got confused. He went silent,’ Kuzmin said.

‘We had nothing else to do than go on a second round. We have worked on this situation many times during training.’

Kuzmin said the air traffic controller ‘apologised’ to the Russian, saying the incident had been a 'failure'.

Limarev, the UTair captain who was praised by his airline for his quick-thinking, said: ‘As we were getting ready to land, about 10, 15 seconds prior to reaching the rear end of the runway, we noticed the Argentinian Airbus A340-300 moving at 60 degrees towards the runway we were approaching.

‘The weather was fine, so after the Argentinian plane reached the runway and got onto it, we went onto a second round, not waiting for the air traffic controller's command.

‘It took us about 15 minutes to complete the second round. When we finished it we approached the airport again and successfully landed at El Prat.

‘As we were taxiing the airport's controller apologised on the radio for the situation.’

UTair - one of Russia's largest airlines, based at Khanty-Mansiysk in Siberia - praised the captain for his 'composure and professional excellence' after 'appropriately' assessing the situation.

The airline said that the matter was under investigation.

Plane enthusiast Miguel Angel, who filmed the drama, described it as ‘one of the worst experiences I have ever had’.

Spanish airport authority AENA announced a request for the country's civil aviation safety commission, CIAIAC, to examine the near miss and its causes.

David Guillamon, spokesman for the Spanish air-traffic controller association, Aprocta, said the incident was a ‘serious case, but claimed that despite appearances, there was ‘no danger of a collision’.
