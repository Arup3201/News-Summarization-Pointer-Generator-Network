New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has been criticized for putting children at risk by failing to declare a snow day as blizzards hit the city on Wednesday.

Teachers' unions and elected officials called the mayor's decision a 'mistake' as schools were kept open despite New York's governor declaring a state of emergency.

NBC weather anchor Al Roker even took time out from his Olympic coverage to blast the mayor's snow policy, saying: 'It’s going to take some kid or kids getting hurt before this goofball policy gets changed.'

Mistake: Mayor Bill de Blasio, at a press conference on the winter storm, has been criticized for not closing schools

De Blasio has previously said keeping 
schools open was important for working parents, but with more than 5in 
of snow falling already and a further 14in expected, he was accused of 
compromising safety.

Safety fears: Weather anchor Al Roker complained that schools were open

Today show presenter Roker led the angry criticism of de Blasio after he kept New York City schools open while the rest of the state declared a state of emergency amid heavy snowfall.

In an angry series of tweets Roker, whose daughter goes to school in the city, even forecast de Blasio would be a one-term mayor.

He said: ‘Chancellor says Macy's is open, schools should be open. They're also open on Thanksgiving, nights and Sundays. Are you kidding?’

‘And how about all the parents and caregivers who have to scramble to get their kids home? Is there no one there with any common sense?'

Roker, who has twice been voted best weatherman, added: ‘Why are schools all around NYC 
closed? It's going to take some kid or kids getting hurt before this 
goofball policy gets changed.'

‘@NYCMayorsOffice
 @NYCSchools snow policy is ridiculous. Tell people to stay off the 
roads. Stay home. But send your kids/teachers/staff in?'

Others also joined the criticism.

'I
 understand the desire to keep schools open,' Michael Mulgrew, the 
president of the city's union, told Politicker.

'The only thing that 
trumps that is safety. Having students, parents and staff traveling in 
these conditions was unwarranted. It was a mistake to open schools 
today,' he added.

A de Blasio spokeswoman declined to 
comment but noted that city schools have only had 11 snow days since 
1978. In the past, de Blasio has said keeping schools open is important 
for working parents.

Questionable policy: Al Roker tweets about de Blasio's decision to keep schools open

The mayor responded to Roker's tweets, saying: 'It’s a different thing to run a city than to give the weather on TV.'

The response promoted Roker to say: 'Mr Mayor, I could never run NYC, but I know when it's time to keep kids home from school.'

At
 a press conference on Thursday morning, the mayor had said five to 
eight inches of snow had fallen so far, but he expected up to 14in 
by Friday morning.

He
 said that the city had put 1,900 snow plows on the roads and 475 salt 
spreaders, as well as 800 workers shoveling at bus stops, streets and 
fire hydrants - but urged people to clear their own walks and stay off 
the road, if possible.

Prediction: Roker forecast de Blasio will be a one-term mayor over his school snow policy

Personal: Roker, whose daughter goes to a school in the city, was concerned for children's safety

'The city of New York got it wrong today,' Staten Island assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis said.

'Keeping schools open and expecting 
children to travel through heavy snow, sleet and ice at the same time 
the city is urging residents to stay off the road is nonsensical.'

Assemblyman Joe Borelli also complained about the decision in a Facebook message to residents in his South Shore area.

Others
 complained that the decision to keep the schools open was made early, 
with parents receiving an email from Chancellor Carmen Fariña at 
10.33pm.

The Department of Education message read: 'Parents, as always, should exercise 
their own judgment with regard to their children. Safety is a top 
priority for the department.'

A spokeswoman for de Blasio declined to comment, but added that city schools have had only 11 snow days since 1978.

At a press conference Thursday morning, de Blasio made no mention of schools as he urged people to stay off the road.
