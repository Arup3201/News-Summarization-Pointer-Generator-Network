Brussels is probing Ireland and other European countries offering tax sweeteners to companies like Apple that could help them keep billions of pounds of profits.

Luxembourg and the Netherlands will also be investigated by Eurocrats to see if the rock-bottom corporation tax rates they offer to big brands like Starbucks are illegal.

According to a US Senate report earlier this year Apple has a 'special deal' with Dublin and pays no more than two per cent tax on profits, at least 10 per cent below what some other businesses have to in Ireland.

Complex: Apple uses five companies located in Ireland (pictured) to carry out its tax strategy, which politicians say helps them use the country as a 'tax haven'

MPs accused Starbucks of using a similar system in Holland to help them slash their UK tax bill by claiming they had little or no taxable profit in Britain.

The European Commission has reportedly demanded that officials in Dublin, The Hague, and Luxembourg fully explain their tax rules for big business.

Tough: Apple CEO Tim Cook has been forced to answer probing question's about the company's tax strategy this year

'At the moment we are simply gathering information on tax rulings,' the Commission told the Financial Times.

Apple uses five companies located in 
Ireland to carry out its tax strategy, a 40-page report issued by 
the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said earlier this year.

The
 probe, which saw Apple chief Tim Cook defending the brand before a 
Senate panel in May, discovered that Apple employs a group of 
affiliate companies outside America to allegedly avoid paying tax.

The report said: 'Ireland has essentially functioned as a tax haven for Apple'.

‘Apple wasn't satisfied with shifting its profits to a low-tax offshore tax haven,’ Senator Carl Levin the subcommittee's chairman, said.

‘Apple sought the Holy Grail of tax avoidance. It has created offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars, while claiming to be tax resident nowhere.’

Apple's five companies are located at the same address in Cork and they share 
members of their boards of directors.

While all five companies were incorporated in Ireland, only two of them also have tax residency in that country.

That
 means the other three aren't legally required to pay taxes in Ireland 
because they aren't managed or controlled in that country, in Apple's 
view.

The company can legally shift profits to its different operations, which results in it paying less tax.

Apple's
 arrangement has allowed it to pay just 1.9 per cent tax on its $37billion in overseas profits in 2012, despite the fact that the average 
tax rate for countries in its main markets was 24 per cent last year, the report.

The 
subcommittee's report estimates that Apple avoided at least $3.5 billion
 in US taxes in 2011 and $9 billion in 2012 by using the tactic.

Apple says it complies with the law and pays 'an extraordinary amount' of tax.

Tax efficient: The Starbucks logo is seen in the window of one of its coffee shops. Huge payments to overseas subsidiaries meant it recorded a loss, helping it to avoid paying tax for a fourth year in a row

Starbucks has reportedly handed over just £8.6 million in corporation tax in 14 years of trading in Britain, although it has since agreed to pay £20 million after the public outcry.

And Google reportedly paid just £7.3million in corporation tax on sales of £3billion.

Tax experts say the figure should have been at least £200million higher.

Vodafone has recently made a multi-million pound settlement with HM Revenue & Customs in the wake of a dispute over the tax it had paid in Britain.

Telecoms giant: Despite employing no staff for five years in Dublin, Vodafone took advantage of Ireland's generous corporate tax rate to record a £324million annual turnover last month

The information was revealed after it was reported that the company ran an Irish subsidiary from a satellite office in Dublin for tax purposes.

Employing no staff for five years, the telecoms giant took advantage of Ireland’s generous corporate tax rate to record a £324million annual turnover collecting royalty payments for the use of its brand.
