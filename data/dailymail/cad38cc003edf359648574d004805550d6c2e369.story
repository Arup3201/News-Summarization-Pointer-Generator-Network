Bradley Saunders will make his Matchroom debut on the Nathan Cleverly vs Tony Bellew undercard after signing a long-term deal with promoter Eddie Hearn.

The unbeaten light welterweight, who has notched up 10 victories from as many fights, will face an as yet unknown opponent in Liverpool on November 22.

Saunders, from Durham, will fight again early next year before headlining a packed card in Newcastle next April.

'I am thrilled to be joining Eddie Hearn and fighting on Sky Sports,' he said. 'I had plenty of options and I definitely chose the best one for me, it's a new chapter and I am raring to go.

'I am looking for big things. I don't want anything less than being a World champion. I played at the game in the amateurs but it is serious now. I want to bring big things to the North East.

'I've had three weeks training for the fight in Liverpool and you'll see a change in me but above that, in the New Year you will see a different Bradley Saunders altogether.

'I was after the British and Commonwealth last year. People didn't want to face me last year and I picked up the WBO Inter-Continental belt and I'm No 11 with them.

Saunders has won his first 10 fights as a professional, stopping eight opponents early

'There are guys out there that aren't really at that weight but up there in the rankings that I know I can beat. 

'This time next year I want to be competing at that top level, I am 28, I'm not a baby, there's no need to hang around.

'I'm a North East lad and I love the North East. I want to be a world champion and I want to bring it back here for the brilliant fans we have. 

'One day I want to open a gym up here and bring the next generation on, but right now it’s about my ultimate goal, next year is a serious year - I am not going to call anyone out because I am so confident that I can get rid of anyone put in my way.'
