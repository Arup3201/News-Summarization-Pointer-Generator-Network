Sarah Monahan, the Hey Dad! actor who accused Robert Hughes of sexual assault, has described how late model Charlotte Dawson was one of the few people who stood by her after she came forward with public accusations against the actor.

Ms Monahan, 37, was six-years-old when she joined the popular television programme and alleges that Hughes began exposing himself to her when she was 10.

The 65-year-old actor is due to be sentenced today for 10 child sex offences, committed between 1983 and 1991.

Sarah Monahan has blasted her 'faux friends' for deserting her after she went public with accusations against Robert Hughes in 2010

Sarah Monahan revealed that late model Charlotte Dawson contacted her in February, less than two weeks before she committed suicide, to wish her well for Robert Hughes's trial

Ms Monahan revealed in a blog post on Tuesday, Faux Friends And Real, that for the last four years she felt 'completely alone, except for Simone [Buchanan]'.

'But everyone else? Not a peep. Not a tweet, text, email, poke or even old fashioned snail mail,' she wrote.

'Funny though, how people keep popping their heads up, to say how much they care; when there's an interview opportunity.'

Ms Monahan went on to reveal she had support from some of her more famous friends, including entertainment reporter Peter Ford, Kyle and Jackie O producer Matt Simpson, and model Charlotte Dawson, who committed suicide in February.

'Charlotte Dawson used to regularly send me messages, privately. The last message I got from her was on the 10th of February. It was the first day of the trial… Charlotte remembered… and let me know she was thinking of me,' she wrote.

Robert Hughes is due to be sentenced today for 10 counts of sexual assault

Ms Monahan wrote this week that she has felt completely alone except for the support of Simone Buchanan (pictured here with her son Tane), who played Ms Monahan's sister on Hey Dad!

Ms Monahan revealed allegations of Hughes's abuse in 2010 to Woman's Day, and then again on A Current Affair. Her interviews reinvigorated public interest in the case, but led to criticism that she had gone to the media and not the police with the story.

She appeared on A Current Affair again in April this year after Hughes had been convicted of 10 child sexual assault charges.

In the most recent interview she told A Current Affair that she 'got away lightly' compared to her on-screen dad Robert Hughes' other victims - but was relieved and vindicated by his guilty verdict.

Ms Monahan, who currently lives in the U.S. where she is a a member of the Texas State Guard. She also works with US-based agency Minor Consideration, which advocates on behalf of child actors.

At the sentencing submissions for Robert Hughes in Sydney’s Downing Centre Court on May 3, Ms Monahan’s victim statement revealed the she may never be able to return to Australia as a result of the abuse she suffered at Hughes' hands decades ago.

'I have come to hate the word dad,' her statement read.

'I learned that anyone in a position of power was free to do as they pleased. I have flashbacks to Robert... He made me think the world was a cold, evil place.

'I'm 37 years old and I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up.'
