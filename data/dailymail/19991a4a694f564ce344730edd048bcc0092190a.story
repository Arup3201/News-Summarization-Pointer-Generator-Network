A Pennsylvania mother-of-two is facing jail time after disclosing to police during a routine traffic stop last year in New Jersey that she had a loaded handgun in the vehicle.

Shaneen Allen, 27, of Philadelphia, bought the gun legally and has a concealed carry permit in her home state, but New Jersey does not recognize the gun license.

Allen went from getting only a traffic ticket to being arrested and charged with illegal gun possession and armor-penetrating bullets, records showed.

The handgun: Allen's .380 Bersa Thunder, similar to the one pictured, is what landed her in hot water

‘She voluntarily and honestly told the officer that she had her licensed handgun and gave him her license to carry,’ Allen's attorney Evan Nappen told WCAU.

‘She’s a hard-working single mom. It’s really crazy that New Jersey is taking someone who’s got no criminal record and was doing nothing wrong — other than a minor traffic violation — and making it into a felony-level conviction with minimal mandatory time.’

Nappen claims his client was unaware that new Jersey did not reciprocally recognize Pennsylvania gun permits even though 30 other states do.

Allen did not know her .380 Bersa Thunder handgun loaded with hollow-point bullets was illegal in the Garden State, and faces a mandatory three-year prison sentence if found guilty.

There would be no chance of parole.

‘We’re talking about a law-abiding, licensed person who did nothing wrong,’ Nappen told WWOR. 'She is now facing three-years minimum mandatory, where the judge has no discretion, in state’s prison.’

Mother-of-two: The single mom bought the handgun to protect her family after multiple break-ins of her home, according to her attorney

Innocent: Allen's attorney claims New Jersey should recognize her Pennsylvania gun license

Allen bought the gun as protection for her family only a week earlier after her home was broken into twice, according to Nappen.

The Atlantic County Prosecutor has denied a request to allow Allen into a diversionary program that would allow her to avoid jail time, Nappen told WWOR.

She is the mother to two young daughters and has no prior criminal record outside a handful of minor traffic violations, records showed.

Nappen claims to have handled about a dozen similar cases in the past year, and is now working on getting a federal law passed to address the issue.

Prison time: If convicted, Allen faces a minimum of three years behind bars

‘People believe that your gun license should be treated like your driver’s license. Right now there’s a national law being proposed that would mandate that all states recognize other states licenses,’ he told WCAU. ‘It’s still pending, but it's needed for people like this.

‘I’m calling that bill Shaneen’s law.’

Gun laws are decided at the state – not federal – level, and New Jersey’s are among the nation’s strictest.

‘Each state has legal authority to regulate behavior within its borders,’ University of Pennsylvania Law School professor Kermit Roosevelt told WCAU.

‘So, they're saying we have laws, and if you come here, you have to play by our rules,’ he explained, adding that police had every right to arrest Allen.

Roosevelt did agree, though, that a federal law would be a more reasonable solution.

Nappen said he will ask for a dismissal of all charges at Allen’s next court date on August 5.

Allen did not respond to multiple MailOnline messages left seeking further comment.
