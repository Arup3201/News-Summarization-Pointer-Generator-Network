Three days before the 1994 State of the Union Address, President Bill Clinton's advisers fretted about including a line promising that participants in the still-viable Hillarycare insurance overhaul would be allowed to keep their favored doctors and health care plans, a concern that would come back years later when President Barack Obama promised the same thing.

The line, which made it into the final speech in a slightly different form – Clinton told Americans they would have 'the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor' – was the subject of controversy because his aides knew it was untrue.

'We have a line on p. 10 that says "You'll pick the health plan and the doctor of your choice,"' an internal memo read.

'I know that it's just what people want to hear. But can we get away with it?' he asked. 'I am very worried about getting skewered for over-promising here on something we know full well we won't deliver.'

The Clintons' first term in the White House was marred by the failure of 'Hillarycare,' an earlier proposed version of what would later become law as the Affordable Care Act

'Over-promising': A 1994 memo released Friday shows a Clinton aide encouraging the president to drop from his State of the Union address a line promising Americans they could keep their health care plans and their doctors

In his 1994 State of the Union address, Bill Clinton promised Americans 'the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor' -- 13 years before Barack Obama made nearly identical pledges

The memo was part of more than 4,000 pages of documents released by the Bill Clinton Presdiential Library, and offers new insights into the development – and 'sale' to Congress – of the ill-fated Hillarycare program that represented a major public embarrassment for then-first lady Hillary Clinton.

'Isn’t the whole thrust of our health plan to steer people toward cheaper, HMO-style providers?' wrote the memo's author, identified only as Todd.

'It’s one thing to say we’ll preserve your option to pick the doctor of your choice (recognizing that this will cost more), it’s quite another to appear to promise the nation that everyone will get to pick the doctor of his or her choice,' he added. 'And that’s exactly what this line does.'

Obama drew fire in 2013 for repeatedly promising that under the Affordable Care Act, now law, 'if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,' and 'if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.'

But horror stories have emerged, marginalized by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democrats as 'false' and 'phony,' demonstrating that significant numbers of Americans have lost the breadth of medical choices they once had.

PolitiFact, a project of the Tampa Bay Times, designated Obama's version of the Clinton-era promise as its 'Lie of the Year' in December.

In 1994, however, President Clinton made the same pledge.

'This IS a tax, a hefty tax': Clinton adviser Ira Magaziner warned the boss that he could go down in history as the author of '$40 billion in new taxes' if Hillarycare wasn't spun deftly enough

Tip of the iceberg: Archivists at the Cliinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas has at least 78 million pages of paper files and 23 million emails from the 1993-2001 administration, and released fewer than 5,000 pages on Friday

No 'decrease in their premiums': Hillarycare crafters knew ahead of time that it would be impossible to give policyholders a price break even though government would be collecting an extra $40 billion from insurance companies

His wife had already reassured Republican members of Congress, in an effort to bring them on board with her signature law, that the White House's plan would not increase the cost of health care.

'One of the objectives that the President directed us to pursue from the very beginning was, how did we make this a financial benefit for the majority of Americans who are already insured?' she told GOP leaders on Capitol Hill in September 1993, just eight months after becoming first lady.

'There is no way we could good in conscience go to the American public and present a plan that would either [sic] alter their expectations about what the system looks like, while at the same time increasing their costs and perhaps not providing the kind of security that they need and they should be able to rely on.'

Yet while the first lady was arm-twisting on Capitol Hill with promises that costs would come to heel, White House senior staffers were hoisting red flags.

'It is important to note that people and businesses will not see a decrease in their premiums, despite the compression of system costs,' two aides wrote to Clinton adviser Ira Magaziner, then the White House's health care policy quarterback.

Many of the same issues that have made Obamacare a practical minefield, it turns out, came up 20 years ago.

Good old days: Hillarycare was a serious but failed effort to redesign the U.S. health care system, years before the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal sucked all the oxygen out of Clinton's presidency

Leveraging heroes: Chris Jennings, a Hillary Clinton aide who now works in the Obama White House, acknowledged that it was important to get veterans on board in order to scare Republicans from voting 'no' on Hillarycare

The principal difference between Hillarycare and Obamacare was that the former relied on squeezing funds out of insurance companies, while the latter requires individuals and employers to buy their products.

Magaziner candidly admitted in one strategy memo that 'this is a tax, a hefty tax, which will, it seems to us, provide at least 2/3 of the revenue for your access fund.'

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Obamacare's financial penalties on Americans who don't buy insurance were, too, 'taxes.'

Another revelation came in an early memo from Clinton – and now Obama – adviser Chris Jennings. He wrote to the first lady just two months into her tenure that she would have to court the support of veterans for whatever health reform proposal she chose to undertake.

'One extraordinarily important political goal of any health reform proposal,' he advised in March 1993, 'is to design it in such a way that a vote against the Clinton health reform initiative is a vote against veterans.'

Another adviser set out advice that Obama might have found helpful: 'It is important for us to avoid the perception tha twe will be placing all the burdens on businesses; along these lines, please try to avoid the word MANDATE.'

The Clinton Library in Arkansas released more than 4,000 pages of documents from the 1993-2001 Bill Clinton White House, including a series of bombshell revelations.
