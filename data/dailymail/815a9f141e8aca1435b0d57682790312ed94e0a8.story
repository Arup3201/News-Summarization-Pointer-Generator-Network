Newmarket officials are searching for a rapid outcome after being left in the unsatisfactory position of having to potentially make significant changes to its prestigious Autumn 2015 two-year-old programme.

The race switches will mean schedules published in diaries and calendars, important sources of information as racegoers plan visits to the Jockey Club-owned track, will be out of date.

It also means further upheaval at a venue which controversially lost the Group One Champion Stakes to Ascot in 2011 much to the annoyance of many of its regular attenders.

Definitely moving is the Group One Middle Park Stakes, which will revert to its tradition slot during the Cambridgeshire Festival on Saturday 26 September.

The one-year experiment of staging Future Champions day 24 hours before Champions Day at Ascot appears over while a new option of running the Group One Dewhurst Stakes on Saturday 10 October has still to be confirmed.

Amy Starkey, Regional Director of the Jockey Club’s East Region, welcomed the new date of the Middle Park but conceded both the composition and date of other race days had still to be finalised.

Starkey said: ‘We can move of the Dewhurst Stakes but it does not mean we will. We will act in the best interests of Newmarket, the Jockey Club and British racing. There are a number of options and we are working through them with the BHA.’

The latest changes have been sanctioned by the European Pattern Committee which agrees race slots on the international calendar.

Staging the six-furlong Middle Park and seven-furlong Dewhurst on the same Future Champions day card was another controversial 2011 move.

The fact there should now be the traditional two-week gap between the races will be seen as a victory over the fixture-list tinkermen, who pay little attention to tradition.

Brian Kavanagh, chairman of the EPC, said: ‘Having the Middle Park Stakes over six furlongs and the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs on the same programme is not ideal.

‘The British authorities initially came to us with these changes and believed in them at the time. Somewhat, reluctantly the EPC gave its approval at the time and we are now going back to a preferable outcome. It is still not perfect but it is an improvement.’

The switches in the British fixture list have been allowed because the French authorities requested the Group One Prix Jean Luc Lagardere, run at the Longchamp Arc meeting, be extended from seven furlongs to a mile, so not presenting a proximity clash with the Dewhurst.

Jonjo O'Neill's Holywell could run in Saturday's galliardhomes.com Cleeve Hurdle at Cheltenham

Meanwhile, Jonjo O'Neill's Cheltenham Gold Cup hope Holywell is a fascinating possible entry in Saturday's galliardhomes.com Cleeve Hurdle at Cheltenham.

The gelding, a winner at the last two Cheltenham Festivals, has failed to win in his two steeplechase runs this season, unseating at Aintree in December on his last effort. But his record at the Festival means he is still prominent in the Gold Cup betting.

Entries for the Cleeve, a notable trial for the World Hurdle in March, also include Paul Nicholls-trained Saphir Du Rheu, who reverts to hurdles after failing to complete on two of his three novice chase starts, Beat That, Cole Harden, At Fishers Cross, novice Blaklion, and Reve De Sivola.

Trainer Oliver Sherwood is hoping his Hennessy Gold Cup winner Many Clouds can take another step towards the Cheltenham Gold Cup when he runs in the BetBright Cup Chase at the course on Saturday.
