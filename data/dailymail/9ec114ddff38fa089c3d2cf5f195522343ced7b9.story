The moment art changed forever and the Impressionist movement was born has been pinpointed thanks to science, a leading astrophysics expert has claimed. 

Professor Donald Olson believes his team of Texas State University researchers have calculated the exact point in time the sunrise in Claude Monet's Soleil Levant, or Impressions, Sunrise, appeared.

That moment, he says, was 7.35am on 13 November, 1872.  

Monet's Impressions, Sunrise shows the port of Le Havre in the morning and gave rise to the name of the Impressionist movement. Researchers believe it was painted at 7.35am on 13 November, 1872

Debate has raged for years over when the enormously-influential work was painted and whether the sun in the painting is rising or setting.

The painting shows the port of Le Havre, in north-western France, in the morning. In the background, some of the ships anchor.

Art historians say it gave rise to the name of the Impressionist movement which, in part, led to the creation of modern art.

To find out when the sun was rising researchers used geographical analysis, astronomical calculations of the rising sun, tide levels and meteorological observations of the sea and the sky.

The team also compiled the scant documentary evidence from the artist and visited the location, to more accurately pinpoint the potential date, The Independent reported.

Professor Olson will present his findings in an essay published in the catalogue for an exhibition featuring the work at the Musée Marmottan Monet in Paris, which opens next month.

Marianne Mathieu, deputy director and head of collections at the museum, said: 'We wanted to pay tribute to this very important painting.

'Much of the history and details about this iconic work were unknown. With these techniques we could uncover new information.'

She added: 'I wanted to work with Don. He had done it before and on this did wonderful work.'  

The 19th century art movement originated in Paris during the 1870s and 1880s, in the face of opposition from the conventional art community who objected to the lack of sharp lines and contours, and artistic detail.

Instead, Impressionist works focus on recording a moment and are characterised by thin, visible brush strokes.

Among the most famous of the Impressionists are Edouard Manet, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, Alfred Sisley and Camille Pissarro.

In October 1985, armed robbers made their way into the opened Musee Marmottan Monet and tore Impression, Sunrise as well as eight other paintings by Monet from the walls.

They were recovered only five years later.
