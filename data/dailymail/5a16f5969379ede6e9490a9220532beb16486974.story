Marijuana has long been accused of affecting memory and thinking ability. 

But new research has found it may actually help with the effects of brain ageing.

U.S. researchers say that extremely low levels of the compound THC, the active ingredient in the drug, may slow or halt the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.

Lighting up: At the low doses studied, researchers found the benefits of THC in delaying the progression of Alzheimer's outweighed the risks of memory impairment

At the low doses studied, the therapeutic benefits of THC appear to outweigh the associated risks of THC toxicity and memory impairment, they found.

The research could lead to drugs being developed to treat the disease from related compounds that are safe and legal. 

Professor Chuanhai Cao, lead author of the study and a neuroscientist at the Byrd Alzheimer’s Institute in Florida, explained that THC decreases the amount of amyloid beta in the brain.

Amyloid beta is one of the factors that leads to Alzheimer’s and researchers are currently attempting to create drugs that could help stop the production of this protein.

Devastating: There are currently 800,000 people with dementia in the UK

Professor Cao said: ‘THC is known to be a potent antioxidant with neuroprotective properties.

This is the first report that confirms THC decreases levels of the amyloid beta protein, protecting against the progression of Alzheimer's. 

Dr Neel Nabar, who co-authored the study said: ‘While we are still far from a consensus, this study indicates that THC and THC-related compounds may be of therapeutic value in Alzheimer’s disease,’

He continued: ‘Are we advocating that people use illicit drugs to prevent the disease? No. 

'It’s important to keep in mind that just because a drug may be effective, it doesn’t mean it can be safely used by anyone. 

'However, these findings may lead to the development of related compounds that are safe, legal, and useful in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.’

This week the results of another study found marijuana could be used for medical purposes. 

European researchers suggested marijuana could also treat schizophrenia, and may be much more effective than other drugs by having fewer side effects.

An ingredient found in pomegranates could help slow the onset of Alzheimer’s and curb some of its symptoms, a study has found.

University of Huddersfield researchers found that punicalagin - a chemical compound found in the pomegranate fruit - can inhibit inflammation in specialised brain cells known as micrologia. (It is inflammation that leads to Alzheimer's disease getting progressively worse.)

The painful inflammation that accompanies illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis and Parkinson's disease could also be reduced, the study found.

Dr Olumayokun Olajide, the lead author of the study, is still working on how much pomegranate is required to be effective, but says regular consumption of the fruit is still beneficial.

He said: ‘We do know that regular intake and regular consumption of pomegranate has a lot of health benefits - including prevention of neuro-inflammation related to dementia.'
