Arsenal head to north London rivals Totttenham on Saturday without leading scorer Alexis Sanchez as he continues to struggle with a hamstring injury.

His absence is a blow for the Gunners but boss Arsene Wenger does have Danny Welbeck in contention following his thigh problem.

Welbeck hasn't featured since a 2-1 win at West Ham on December 28.

Danny Welbeck's return from injury is a timely boost for Arsenal following the news of Sanchez's blow 

Speaking to arsenal.com, Wenger said: 'The latest is that Alexis is not ready. He is not far away, the Leicester game is a possibility.

'He is of course very difficult to keep quiet. He is training but it's light training. Welbeck is back in the group. Apart from that we have the same squad available as last week.'

Midfielder Jack Wilshere is stepping up his recovery from his long-term ankle injury as Wenger confirmed: 'Jack is back in full training next week, hopefully from Sunday.'

The 23-year-old England international has also risked a stern telling off from his manager after pictures emerged of him apparently holding a shisha pipe.
