A student has started cooking his meals on the engine of his car to avoid over-priced service station sandwiches and junk food.

Sports management student Alfred Cary, 22, cooks delicious food by placing it on the engine of his Ford Ka and going for long drives.

The engine heats up to such a degree that by the end of his journey his food is steamed to perfection.

Mr Cary, a fourth year student at the University of Edinburgh, rustles up mouth-watering steaks, succulent duck breast and even pigeon by wrapping the pre-prepared meals in tin foil and placing them under the bonnet while he drives.

Alfred reaches into the engine block to retrieve his mouth-watering meal

The car cook says the tin foil forms a tight seal and the food doesn't get contaminated by engine smells

Mr Cary said: 'The food tastes really good, pretty much the same as if you steamed it at home.

'It doesn’t taste at all like oil or petrol fumes. The tin foil totally separates it from the engine.”

Mr Cary started preparing his meals on wheels after he began making regular trips from his family home in Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire to Edinburgh.

Finding that the only meals on offer were expensive fast food and greasy fry-ups from motorway service stations, he hit upon an innovative solution.

The inventive chef decided to use a technique developed by long-distance truckers in the USA which involves double-wrapping food in tin foil and leaving it behind the grille next to the hot engine.

He said: 'I was driving with my brother and he had read about engine cooking somewhere, so we decided to skip the motorway services on our journey home.

'We made lamb chops the first time. They tasted phenomenal when we got them out of the engine.

'It makes sense - why pay someone to heat food up for on the road you when you have a heat source going to waste right right there in front of you?'

Mr Cary now uses his engine to prepare food whenever he is on the road and enjoys the luxury of tucking into gourmet home-cooked meals surrounded by the picturesque British countryside.

He keeps an old wine box full of kitchen utensils, horseradish, harissa, herbs, spices and olive oil in the boot of his car.

He said: 'I prepare something beforehand and stick it under the bonnet just before I set off. When it has cooked I pull over to the side of the road and enjoy it in a nice spot.

'I never drive just to cook, I only ever cook when I drive. It is more environmentally-friendly that way.”

Mr Cary has used his unusual cooking technique to impress his girlfriend Claudia Cristwell, 21, by taking her on romantic drives with dinner cooking in the engine.

He said: 'I have prepared sea bass and a tuna burger for my girlfriend while out driving - she loves it.'

Roasted pepper is among the many dishes the enterprising young cook can whip up

Mr Cary has even written a cookbook entitled ‘Carbecue: The Complete Guide to Cooking on a Car Engine’ which instructs readers on how to prepare delicious meals on their own motors.

The ‘a la car’ menu contains 25 recipes which vary depending on journey time.

A baked camembert can be prepared over a 25 minute drive, while a five-spice duck breast with noodles takes one hour.

Mr Cary can rev up Chinese pork tenderloin during a one hour 50 minute journey.

He said: 'My favourite dish to cook is the oriental sea bass with lemon, chilli and ginger on a bed of spinach.

'I had read some guides on how to cook using your engine but every recipe was for processed sausages. I wanted to show that you can prepare really delicious meals.”

The book, priced £11.95 is on sale at www.carbecue.co.uk
