This is the heart-warming moment a homeless man is finally given a place of his own after a crowd funding effort saw enough money raised to give him a house.

The man, named only as Eric, became an internet hit back in March after Youtube prankster, Magic of Rahat, surprised him with a ‘fake’ lottery ticket in Virginia.

Rahat had actually put $1,000 behind the counter of a local store and instructed the assistant to give Eric the money when he presented the ticket.

The stunt was captured on camera gaining 15.8 million views in just two months, with the footage showing an emotional Eric breaking down in tears and hugging his new prankster friend.

Viewers were so taken with the video, that donations to help out Eric started flooding in with a total of $44,000 being raised.

Rahat then used the money to rent a house for a year for Eric, as well as furnish it, purchase supplies and open a savings account for the homeless man.

Not only does the video reveal that Eric has a new home, he also tells Rahat that he now has a job too

Now a new video has emerged of Eric being given the keys to his new home after being taken there by Rahat, under the pretence that they were going to visit the prankster’s home.

When inside, Rahat then declares that the house is actually for Eric and welcomes him to his new place.

Eric can’t believe his luck, and repeatedly says: ‘You got to be kidding me right?’

He then embraces Rahat and thanks him for all help before the pair go on a tour of the house.  

The new video was only uploaded to Youtube on Wednesday and already has been viewed more than 5 million times.
