As proud mother to six-week-old Hazel, Emily Blunt looks every inch the yummy mummy already. But just one month before she welcomed her daughter, she posed for Vogue in a sensational pre-baby shoot.

In the resulting image, captured by fashion photographer Norman Jean Roy, the actress, 31, cradles her eight-month bump while gazing into the distance, head held high.

In an accompanying interview, she said of the pregnancy: 'It's really the coolest thing that's ever happened to me.'

She says she was busy with work almost until the end of the second trimester, filming Into The Woods alongside James Corden, Johnny Depp, Meryl Strep and Chris Pine.

'I'm playing a baker's wife, so I figured she must eat a lot of buns,' 
she said. 'By the end I was doing a lot of creeping behind 
trees and hiding behind other characters.'

Like most women, though, she admitted that the latter stages of the pregnancy weren't easy.

'I do wake up feeling like my 
grandmother,' she said at the time. 'I sleep with a fortress of pillows around me. I've got one 
of those huge C-shaped ones. My husband calls it Gary.'

In Vogue: Blunt appears in the new April issue

The
 couple welcomed their daughter just a month after the Vogue shoot took 
place, on February 16th. Already, just six weeks on, Blunt has been 
pictured looking healthy and elegant while running errands in LA.

She told Vogue that it was the punishing workouts for Tom Cruise sci-fi flick Edge of Tomorrow that kick-started a healthy lifestyle while pregnant.

'I looked like an aerobics teacher by the end of it. It was almost unattractive,' she said.

'I understand what it 
takes to get in that kind of shape. And when I got pregnant, not long 
after I finished the movie, it helped me to keep active.'

For now, though she is content to play mother and has kept her schedule free to focus on Hazel.

Not that she has ruled out fresh professional challenges in the future - she still has a stint on Broadway in her sights.

'I haven't done a play for ten years,' she said. 'It's so exposing, but it's what I'm most interested in right now.'
