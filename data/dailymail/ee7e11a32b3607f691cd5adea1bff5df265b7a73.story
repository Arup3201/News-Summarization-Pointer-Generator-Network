Retired surgeon Ben Carson said on Sunday that he could form a committee to explore a bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination this month and make a formal announcement in May.

'That's a reasonable time frame,' Carson told Fox News Sunday when asked by host Chris Wallace about the timing of an exploratory committee and formal announcement. 'We're putting all that together,'

Carson is a former Fox News contributor who is popular with Tea Party conservatives and ranked fourth among possible Republican candidates in a recent Fox News poll of potential voters in Iowa. He finished behind former Florida Governor Job Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.

The poll showed growing support for Carson, a bestselling author and conservative commentator, with 10 percent of potential voters saying they would vote for Carson, up from about 8 percent last year.

With a dozen Republicans thinking seriously about running for president in 2016 and 10 more talking up the idea, it's a good time to be an experienced campaign hand.

Potential candidates are scrambling to sort through the rosters of campaign veterans in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire and elsewhere in a talent search that reflects the fact that the Republican field for 2016 is the largest in recent memory.

The competition, dubbed by some as a 'staff primary,' aims to find the right of mix of get-out-the-vote organizers, digital experts, fund-raising stars and messaging professionals able to set up a functioning campaign.

'There is a known universe of operatives with many of them headquartered in early primary states,' said Republican strategist Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to Mitt Romney in his 2012 presidential campaign. 

'Right now I think the contest is focused on all the candidates trying to go after that universe of staffers.'

As many as 21 Republicans are in various stages of considering a presidential run, far more than the dozen or so who gave it a go four years ago. Of these, probably 10 or 12 are really serious and the rest are testing the waters or are trying to promote their personal brand.

Every ideological slice of the Republican spectrum is represented, from mainstream former Florida Governor Jeb Bush to Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a favorite of the small government Tea Party movement, to libertarian Kentucky Senator Rand Paul to retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, a Fox News personality.

Others exploring presidential runs include New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and former Texas Governor Rick Perry.

The field is so large because there is no nominee-in-waiting as there is in the Democratic arena, where former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is widely seen as having a lock on the Democratic nomination should she choose to run. There is also a younger generation of Republican leaders eager to make their mark like Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who is 47, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, 43.
