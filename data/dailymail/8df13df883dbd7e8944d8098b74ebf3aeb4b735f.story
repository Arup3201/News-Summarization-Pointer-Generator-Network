A pet owl that thinks it is human is exasperating its owner by demanding to watch 'male' television programmes like Top Gear and Star Wars.

Natasha Welch, 22, adopted Asian brown wood owl Haru when he was just a chick, but says that now he is seven months-old he has 'taken over' her life.

Ms Welch, from Maidstone in Kent, said Haru has developed human characteristics since she hand-reared him from being a chick - and now has a taste for high-octane television.

Taking over: Natasha Welch adopted Haru when he was just a chick, but says that now he is seven months old he is dominating her life. She says the Asian brown wood owl is convinced she is his mum

Ms Welch, who graduated from university with a fashion degree, now takes Haru around classrooms and fetes after setting up a craft workshop called ‘Owl About Art’.

She said when he was tiny she had to feed him mice and 'supervise him' when he drank water to make sure he didn’t accidentally drown himself.

Ms Welch added: 'When he was a chick it was like having a baby. He would wake me up crying and call for food in the middle of the night.'

'I would hand feed him 10 chicks and a couple of mice a day and have to be with him when he drank water, otherwise he could drown.'

All grown up: When he was a chick (left) Natasha had to feed Haru and 'supervise him' when he drank water to make sure he didn’t accidentally drown. Now he's an adult he is becoming increasingly demanding (right)

Natasha says Haru loves watching television, especially Top Gear (pictured) and Star Wars

Haru even slept in a cot at first, but is now becoming 'the man of the house' and has started to become 'very demanding'.

Ms Welch said: 'He loves watching TV, especially programmes I don’t like, so I have to sit in front of tennis, Top Gear and Star Wars with him... Over Christmas he watched Madagascar all the way through.'

She said the bond between them is so strong the owl treats her as his mother, but added: 'Unlike the saying, owls aren’t actually very clever at all. He thinks I’m his mum and that he’s a human.'

Haru lives in an aviary in Ms Welch’s garden, but Asian brown wood owls are native to India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and China.

She hopes her Owl About Art travelling workshop will encourage children to get into 'owl themed art with a live owl'.

Her website states: 'Natasha & Haru tour the country visiting schools, clubs, nurseries, events, fetes and craft fairs or even your home with this one-of-a-kind experience!'

It adds: Our most popular package includes the ‘make your own’ sock owl workshops where everyone enjoys stuffing socks, decorating their sock owl with felt wings, feet and beaks & cute button eyes.'

Under British law, it is legal to keep many types of owl, including the Asian brown wood owl, providing the bird has not been taken from the wild.

A license is required if there are plans to release the owl into the wild at a later date and there are also a number of laws protecting the sale or transfer of captive-bred owls and their eggs.
