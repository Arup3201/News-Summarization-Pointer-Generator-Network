Left-wing Labour MPs marred generous tributes from across the political divide last night as they used an extraordinary recall of Parliament to launch vicious and intemperate attacks on the late Baroness Thatcher.

A visibly emotional David Cameron said the former Prime Minister’s epitaph should be ‘she made our country great again’ and Labour leader Ed Miliband called her a ‘unique and towering figure’ – while criticising her for closing coal mines, her position on gay rights and other issues.

There were more than seven hours of debate in the Commons – compared with only 45 minutes following the death of Sir Winston Churchill – and five and a half hours in the Lords.

But up to 150 Labour MPs boycotted the
special one-day session, convened in Lady Thatcher’s honour – leaving 
the party’s benches half empty –  while some of those who did attend 
prompted outrage by using the occasion to condemn her.

Glenda
Jackson sparked angry protests from Tory benches as she launched into a
tirade against the ‘heinous’ former Prime Minister, telling MPs she did
not consider her a woman.

‘The
first Prime Minister of female gender, OK. But a woman? Not on my 
terms,’ said Miss Jackson. Her remarks prompted such uproar that the 
Conservative MP for Banbury Sir Tony Baldry attempted to raise a point 
of order with Speaker John Bercow to draw a halt to attacks but was 
rebuffed.

Away from the House, former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair had urged critics of Thatcherite policies to be respectful.

‘Even
if you disagree with someone very strongly, you can still – 
particularly at the moment of their passing – you should show some 
respect,’ he said.

But Miss
Jackson, an Oscar-winning actress who entered the Commons in 1992, 
claimed Lady Thatcher had taught that vices were virtues.

‘Greed, selfishness, no care for the weaker. Sharp elbows and sharp knees, this was the way forward,’ she said. ‘People saw the price of everything and the value of nothing. There was a heinous social, economic and spiritual damage wreaked upon this country.’

Former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott tweeted a link to TV footage of Miss Jackson’s rant, saying he was ‘proud to be a fan’.

Former Labour Environment Minister Michael Meacher said Lady Thatcher lacked the ‘generosity and magnanimity’ that needed to accompany greatness ‘if one is to earn a place in the heart of the nation’.

Veteran MP David Winnick claimed Lady Thatcher had adopted policies that were ‘highly damaging... caused immense pain and suffering to ordinary people’.

Former Labour Housing Minister John Healy was among MPs who stayed away, alleging Mr Cameron had attempted to ‘hijack’ Lady Thatcher’s death for political gain.

Others complained about the costs of recalling Parliament and the taxpayers’ contribution to the cost of Lady Thatcher’s funeral.

Mr Cameron insisted that it was right to commemorate our first and only woman prime minister, who won three elections in a row and was the 20th century’s longest-serving British premier.

‘They say “cometh the hour, cometh the man”. Well in 1979 came the hour and came the lady,’ the Prime Minister said, his voice cracking with emotion. ‘She made the political weather, she made history, and – let this be her epitaph – she made our country great again.’

Replying for Labour, Mr Miliband listed a series of policy areas where he considered ‘she was right’, including the Falklands war.

But areas where he believed she was wrong included on gay and lesbian rights, her position on Nelson Mandela and sanctions against South Africa and for saying there was ‘no such thing as society’.

‘I disagreed with much of what she did but I respect what her death means for many, many people who admired her and I honour her personal achievements,’ he said.

In a poorly-received speech, Nick Clegg said: ‘That those of us who are not from her party can shun the tenets of Thatcherism and yet still respect Margaret Thatcher is part of what was so remarkable about her.’ 

Regrets: Lord Tebbit in the House of Lords yesterday

Baroness Thatcher’s friends and foes alike united yesterday to remember a titan of politics whose public reputation for stridency was tempered by private kindness.

LORD TEBBIT Lady Thatcher’s party chairman, laid bare the fury of Thatcherites at the way the Cabinet ousted her in 1990. Saying he regretted not returning to her Cabinet after caring for his wife, a victim of the Brighton bomb, Lord Tebbit concluded: ‘I left her, I fear, at the mercy of her friends. That I do regret.’

LORD LAMONT the former chancellor, revealed she had told him: ‘You do not have a constructive idea in your head and if you had been in government since 1979 I would have achieved nothing.’ ‘I said: “Well Prime Minister you are always right about everything but there is one thing you are wrong about – I have been in your government since 1979”.’

LORD HOWARD the former Tory leader, said: ‘It has been said many times that she was a divisive figure. She was. She had to be. There was no consensus on the right thing to do for our country. If she had waited for consensus, nothing would ever have happened. She saw what needed to be done and she did it with clarity, courage and conviction.’

LORD ASHDOWN the former Lib Dem leader,  recalled visiting Downing Street with his wife, who ‘hated [Mrs Thatcher’s] policies with a passion’. He continued: ‘The Prime Minister stopped and talked to us for a few moments and as she moved away, my wife hissed through gritted teeth: “She’s absolutely bloody charming, dammit”.’

SIR GERALD KAUFMAN Labour’s shadow foreign secretary in the 1980s, said: ‘Unlike Winston Churchill, Harold Macmillan or Ted Heath, she broke the post-war consensus; that was her objective, and that was her achievement. In personal relationships, and in some policy areas, Margaret Thatcher could be more than civilized – indeed, punctilious and cordial.’

SIR MALCOLM RIFKIND who served as a minister throughout Lady Thatcher’s 11 years in power, said: ‘It was sometimes said that she did not have a sense of humour... but I recall on one occasion that she was asked, “Do you believe in consensus?” To our surprise, we heard her saying, “Yes, I do believe in consensus: There should be a consensus behind my convictions.” I thought at the time that this was an extraordinary example of wit, but as the years have gone by I have realised that she was actually being deadly serious.’

LORD ARMSTRONG
Lady Thatcher’s cabinet secretary, recalled how French president 
Francois Mitterand flirted with her at their first meeting. ‘I said to 
her: “That visit went rather well, didn’t it?”. She said, “Yes, I 
suppose it did”. Then there was a pause and she said, “Of course he 
likes women, you know”. The President had been – how shall I put it? – 
flattering her femininity throughout the meeting, and she had recognised
that and enjoyed every minute of it.’

LORD FOWLER described his ‘total amazement’ at being named in Lady Thatcher’s first Cabinet and his disappointment at being  named transport minister.  “Norman,” she said, “I did transport, you can do transport”.’

LORD JOPLING who was Lady Thatcher’s chief whip in her first term, recalled her personal kindness: ‘At the first Christmas for which she was Prime Minister, she said to me: “Do you know of any of our people in the Commons who are going to be alone this Christmas period? If you do, I would like to ask them to stay at Chequers”. That, I thought at the time, was one of the most generous things from somebody with all the pressures on them of being prime minister.’

BARONESS WILLIAMS one of the Gang of Four who founded the SDP, recalled the strength of Lady Thatcher’s marriage to husband Denis: ‘I cannot underline too strongly the extent to which I think Mrs Thatcher began to lose her life when he passed away.’

LORD YOUNG of Graffham Lady Thatcher’s trade secretary, praised her ‘compassion’. He said: ‘Every night during the six weeks of the (Falklands) campaign she would have a list of the casualties and every night, before going to bed, she would write a long hand-written letter to the parents or the partner.’

CONOR BURNS MP a close friend, recalled a taxi ride to her home. He said: ‘I went to pay the driver, but he refused to take the fare. The driver said: “Your fare tonight, guv, is you go in there and you tell her from me that we ain’t had a good’un since!” I imparted that message to Margaret, who looked at me and said: “Well, he’s quite right.”’
