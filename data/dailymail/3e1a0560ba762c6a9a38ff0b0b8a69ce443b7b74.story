The routes of two urban cycleways across London billed as ‘Crossrail for the bike’ were today unveiled by Mayor Boris Johnson.

They will offer cyclists protection from other road traffic and are the centrepiece of a £913million project to get more Londoners on to two wheels.

The north-south route will run for more than three miles from Elephant & Castle in south London to King’s Cross in north London.

Across London: The east-west route will run from Barking east of London to Acton in west London, a distance of over 18 miles, including a section on the Westway

The east-west route will run from 
Barking, east London, to Acton in west London, a distance of over 18 
miles, including a section on the Westway flyover.

Protected
 cycle routes will also be created through dangerous junctions, 
including Tower Hill, Blackfriars, Parliament Square and Lancaster Gate.

Connections will be created to cycle routes serving other parts of the City, West End and suburbs.

Subject
 to detailed public consultation - which begins today - work will start 
early next year and the routes will open in March 2016.

Mr Johnson said: ‘Bikes already make up 24 per cent of all rush-hour traffic in central London - hundreds of thousands of journeys every day that would otherwise be made by car or public transport.

'Getting more people on to their bikes will reduce pressure on the road, bus and rail networks, cut pollution, and improve life for everyone'

‘Because this isn’t just about cyclists. Getting more people on to their bikes will reduce pressure on the road, bus and rail networks, cut pollution, and improve life for everyone, whether or not they cycle themselves.’

The project is said to be creating Europe’s longest substantially-segregated urban cycleways, and opening up new journey opportunities for cyclists.

The proposed riverside cycle track on Victoria Embankment would also mean cyclists there would not need to cross side-roads.

Leon Daniels, managing director of 
surface transport at Transport for London, said: ‘Cycling in London is 
becoming more popular by the day.

'This cycle way will attract new people to cycling - young and old - because they will feel safer and more confident using a convenient route'

Martin Key, British Cycling

‘These new Cycle Superhighways will further transform London into a continental cycle-tropolis for riders of all ages.’

Subject
 to public consultation - which begins today - work will start early 
next year and the routes are expected to open in March 2016.

British Cycling’s campaigns manager 
Martin Key said: ‘Continuous segregated routes have proved hugely 
successful in Holland and are an affordable transport solution for 
cities.

‘This cycle way will attract new people to cycling - young 
and old - because they will feel safer and more confident using a 
convenient route.’

'Crossrail for the bike': The east-west cycle superhighway will run for 18 miles from Barking in the east to Acton in the west

Some 19,000 cyclists are killed or injured in reported road accidents in the UK every year, according to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents.

Last autumn six cyclists were killed on London's roads in two weeks, leading to calls for more money to be invested in cycle lanes and safety measures.

At the time, former Olympic cyclist Chris Boardman asked Mr Johnson to look at banning heavy good vehicles from the roads during peak hours.

This is a system already implemented in Paris. Out of 14 cyclists killed last year in London, nine were involved in accidents with HGVs.

At Ludgate Circus, one of the areas being redeveloped in the plans, seven cyclists are said to have died since 2008 - the latest being in April this year.

The EAST-WEST Cycle Superhighway would start at Tower Hill, where it would connect to the existing Barclays Cycle Superhighway Route 3 (CS3), which runs east to Canary Wharf and Barking.

From Tower Hill, the new route would run along Lower and Upper Thames Street, Victoria Embankment, across Parliament Square, to Hyde Park Corner and through Hyde Park, across Lancaster Gate and up Westbourne Terrace.

From there, it will travel on the Westway Flyover from Westbourne Bridge to Wood Lane and would continue along the A40 Western Avenue as far as Kathleen Avenue, Acton.

The design of the section from the Westway to Acton is still being finalised and will be consulted on at a later date.

Apart from a short stretch in the Lancaster Gate area and a low traffic street adjacent to Upper Thames Street tunnel, the new Superhighway would be entirely physically segregated.

In central London, there will be connecting Quietway backstreet routes to other parts of the City, the West End, Paddington, Maida Vale, Notting Hill and many other places.

There will also be connections to an upgraded Cycle Superhighway 2 for Mile End and Stratford.

From Tower Hill, the new route would run along Lower and Upper Thames Street, Victoria Embankment and across Parliament Square

There will also be connections to the existing segregated track across Southwark Bridge, connecting to Cycle Superhighway 7 and Quietway routes in Southwark.

Connections are proposed at the western end to Shepherds Bush, Acton, Ealing and Wembley town centres and to the Park Royal trading estate.

Proposals for cycling infrastructure improvements on Westminster Bridge will also be covered as part of the Better Junctions scheme at Westminster Bridge Road.

Our wish is for segregation for cyclists on the bridge, subject to this being feasible.

From Westbourne Terrace, it will travel on the Westway Flyover from Westbourne Bridge to Wood Lane and would continue along the A40 Western Avenue

The NORTH-SOUTH Cycle Superhighway would start at Elephant & Castle, where it would connect to the existing Barclays Cycle Superhighway Route 7 (CS7) at Princess Street.

From Elephant & Castle the North-South Cycle Superhighway would run along St. George’s Road, through St. George’s Circus, along Blackfriars Road and cross Blackfriars Bridge before connecting to the proposed East-West Cycle Superhighway on the north bank of the River Thames.

It is planned to then continue to 
King’s Cross using New Bridge Street, Farringdon Street, Farringdon Road
 and quieter backstreet roads.

The
 southern section between Elephant & Castle and Farringdon station 
would be a largely continuous segregated two-way cycle track.

North
 of Farringdon station, where Farringdon Road is not wide enough for 
segregation in both directions, the route will use low-traffic back 
streets and/or segregation in one direction, subject to further 
consultation with the London Borough of Camden, the highway authority.
