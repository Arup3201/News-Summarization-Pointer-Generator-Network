More than 100 people have fallen severely ill following a major food poisoning outbreak at a Chinese restaurant in Queensland.

Authorities have shut down Chin Chin Chinese Restaurant in Springwood, south of Brisbane, after customers ended up hospitalised when they ate at the establishment on the weekend.

A Metro South Health spokesman said many people had been hospitalised and patient testing indicated a salmonella outbreak, likely from contaminated egg products.

'There have been a lot of people who had the deep fried ice cream who got sick,' the spokesman said.

'But other people didn't have the ice cream and have still gotten sick.'

The spokesman said patients had been presenting at Queensland emergency departments with extremely severe stomach cramps, exacerbated by dehydration.

'In some cases people have been hospitalised and in hospital for a number of days,' he said.

'The age is from very young children to the elderly.

'Their conditions are quite serious, we don't want people underestimate the problem.'

People who dined at the restaurant on Saturday, Sunday and Monday night have been affected.

Customers have made formal complaints to Queensland Health and have bombarded the restaurant's Facebook page with angry comments.

Amy Herbst, 18, was at the restaurant on Sunday with nine other family members for her grandmother's birthday. 

The family ate the banquet and all 10 got sick, with her father and cousin ending up in hospital.

'Seven of us got severely sick and the other three got it for 24 hours or so,' Ms Herbst told Daily Mail Australia.

Contaminated egg products, including those in deep fried ice cream, are believed to have caused the outbreak

'We're still exhausted, we're still all sick and it's just pretty upsetting.

'We've all had to take time off work and it's been really hard because it's been so severe.'

A Logan council spokeswoman said a temporary closure was placed on the restaurant to ensure no further risk while the investigation is being completed.

'We also encourage people who would like to report any other alleged cases of illness to contact Queensland Health,' she said.

The council and Metro South Health say the closure order doesn't mean the restaurant is to blame for the outbreak as it may have been supplied with contaminated food.
