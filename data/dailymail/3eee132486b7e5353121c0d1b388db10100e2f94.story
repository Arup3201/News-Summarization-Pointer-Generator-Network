A woman was repeatedly raped, assaulted and tortured over four days before her throat was slit twice by a far-north Queensland man, a court has heard.

The man - who cannot be named for legal reasons - appeared in the Innisfail Magistrates Court, south of Cairns, on Tuesday afternoon where he denied the string of charges against him.

He faces an attempted murder charge, two counts of rape, as well as multiple deprivation of liberty and assault charges.

It is alleged a 66-year-old man held a 32-year-old woman for four days, and repeatedly raped and tortured her 

Police allege the woman was attacked at a fruit farm between January 15 and 19 near Tully, south of Cairns.

The 32-year-old woman is being treated at Cairns Base Hospital for severe cuts to her throat.

She is in a serious but stable condition.

A bail application by the man's solicitor, Tom Eckersley, was denied by Magistrate Janelle Brassington after a brief appearance in court by the accused on Tuesday afternoon.

The man was also charged with producing dangerous drugs after police allegedly uncovered a cannabis plantation at the property.

Details of what the woman said happened were read to the court by Ms Brassington.

The 66-year-old man appeared in Innisfail Magistrates Court on Tuesday, and was remanded in custody

'The complainant told police that over some days she'd been raped and indecently treated by the defendant,' she said, reading from the police report.

On Monday morning, the man agreed to take the woman to the Cairns airport but instead drove her to the back of his property, the woman alleges.

Her hands were tied with cable ties and the man told her that if she took photos of his property and gave them to police, he would kill her.

'He walked two metres away and kicked her in the back of the knees, and she said she saw him with a silver-coloured instrument and he cut her throat,' Ms Brassington said.

'He then told her he would kill himself and it was her fault.'

It is alleged the man again cut her throat because she was not 'bleeding out'. The man then cut the right side of her face after she started to scream.

The police report said the alleged victim managed to call triple-0, and officers found the woman face down and bleeding about 500m from the house.
