Sunderland have offered Jack Rodwell the chance to revive his stuttering career at the Stadium of Light.

The 23-year-old, who was told he can leave Manchester City by manager Manuel Pellegrini after failing to make an impression on the Chilean, completed a £7million move to the north east.

Rodwell arrived on Wearside at midday on Monday for a meeting with manager Gus Poyet and completed his move on Tuesday on a five-year deal.

Rodwell was due to have a medical at the club’s Academy of Light training ground on Monday. Poyet believes he can reinvigorate the career of Rodwell, who was tipped for greatness by Everton coaches when he was just 12.

‘He was light years ahead of anyone in his age group,’ said one source close to Rodwell, whose life in football could have begun very differently had a certain club across Stanley Park shared the glowing view of the midfielder who was invited to a trial at  Liverpool as a six-year-old.

However Anfield talent-spotters couldn’t quite see what all the fuss was about and they gave Rodwell, who can also play as a central defender, a small trophy to help soften the blow of his rejection.

He was quickly enrolled at Everton and it didn’t take long before the club knew they had someone special on their hands. David Moyes didn’t need any convincing either, handing Rodwell his senior debut at the age of 16 in a UEFA Cup tie against AZ Alkmaar in 2007.

Just five years earlier Moyes had handed another 16-year-old his debut. But those close to Moyes claim the Scot was far more excited about the emergence of Rodwell than he was Wayne Rooney.

Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson agonised over a move for Rodwell, but concluded that the youngster lacked the physical presence to compete for a first-team place.

Stop-start: Rodwell has endured an up-and-down few years on the domestic and international stage

Likewise, upon joining Real Madrid in 2010, Jose Mourinho told scouts to monitor Rodwell’s performances at Everton. But little did Mourinho know that Bernabeu scouts were already doing just that. 

It seemed nothing was going to stop the kid from Southport. But no-one could foresee the injury woes that were just round the corner, with persistent hamstring problems restricting Rodwell to just 19 appearances — two of which came for England — during the 2011-12 season.

Yet that didn’t stop Roberto Mancini splashing £12m on the youngster in August 2012. The Italian had high hopes for Rodwell at City, but the Englishman made just 10 starts for the club in two seasons, due, in part, to his problematic hamstrings.

Those who have studied Rodwell’s injury concerns feel they are partly due to deficiencies in his body alignment rather than a weakness of his leg muscles.

At 23, Rodwell still has time on his side. But he knows he can ill-afford another hamstrung season.
