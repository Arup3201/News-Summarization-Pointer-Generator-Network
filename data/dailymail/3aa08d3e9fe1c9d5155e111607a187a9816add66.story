Beachgoers in an Alabama town are free to swim after a ban citing the high number of sharks in the water was lifted on Tuesday.

Swimming is now allowed in all beaches in Orange Beach again, Al.com reported. Earlier, beaches near Alabama Point were closed.

The city's fire department shared the news with an announcement on its Facebook page.

'We are now flying single RED FLAGS on ALL beaches in Orange Beach,' it said. 'The latest aerial observation revealed a few sharks in the area off the jetties which is pretty normal.

Remember, sharks live in the Gulf, but the large number in the localized area of the jetties since yesterday has decreased significantly. The single RED FLAGS represent DANGEROUS SURF AND RIP CURRENTS.'

Double-red flags on the beaches indicated the waters were closed, Al.com says. 

Lookout: Onlookers gather to see the sharks on Sunday

Audience: Crowds were seen looking for sharks along the jetties

Melvin Shepard, safety director for Orange Beach, told the website that only two sharks were spotted on Tuesday.

'This was the first time we've had to close the waters for this long because of sharks,' he said. 'Hopefully it will be the last time, but you never know.'

Shepard told Al.com on Monday that he saw 'seven or eight sharks right around Alabama Point Pass, and other than that we only saw one or two.'

However, he mentioned that on Sunday he saw 'between 10-to-20' sharks at Alabama Point Pass.

Shephard earlier said in a press release the sharks may have appeared in the water because of fishing waste.

'Hopefully once people stop throwing their fish carcasses into the water, they may not be swimming in such numbers that close to the beach,' he said.
