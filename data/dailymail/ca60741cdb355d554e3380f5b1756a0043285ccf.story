He's a man famous in South America for making outlandish predictions, but his latest declaration has involved debunking the doomsday theories of others.

Mexico's 'Grand Warlock' Antonio Vazquez yesterday declared claims that Mayans have predicted the apocalypse in 2012 to be a 'big fat lie'.

Mr Vazquez, who himself has previously predicted, among other things, the death of Britney Spears and a future invasion of Syria, said yesterday the Mayans never said anything about the world ending.

Claim: Mexican 'Grand Warlock' Antonio Vazquez said predictions of an apocalypse based on an ancient Mayan calendar were 'big fat lies'

Conspiracy theorists studying the ancient Mayan calendar had interpreted the end of the its long-count cycle in December next year as a date when the apocalypse would arrive and the world would end.

The so-called long-count Mayan calendar, which spans 5,125 years starting in 3114 B.C., reaches the end of a cycle on December 21, 2012.

That day signals the end of the 13th Bak'tun, an almost 400-year period in the Maya long-count calendar.

The end of this period has been misunderstood to represent the end of the world, while Mexican Mr Vazquez described the apocalyptic assumption as 'big fat lies'.

Rather than moving to the next Bak'tun, the long-count calendar will reset at the end of the 13th cycle in the same way a car which has traveled 99,999.9 miles resets to zero.

Emiliano Gallaga Murrieta, the Chiapas state division director of Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History, told National Geographic the end of the long count simply represents the end of an old cycle and the beginning of a new one.

End of an era: The event at the end of the ancient Mayan calendar in 2012 could simply be the end of a cycle rather than the apocalypse, according to experts

Mr Vazquez could not make his declaration without revealing his latest outlandish predictions, however.

The Mexican has been making predictions from tarot card readings and astrology for 25 years, with somewhat mixed results.

The self-appointed Grand Warlock believes witchcraft caused the rash of cancer cases among South American leaders.

The film 2012 made an understated depiction of the apocalypse, but current predictions are nothing more than a misreading

Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, president of Argentina, announced on Tuesday that she was suffering from thyroid cancer, which has a high survival rate.

Other South American politicians who have been struck by the disease include Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff, her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and Fernando Lugo, president of Paraguay.

The
inscription describes the return of mysterious god Bolon Yokte at the 
end of a 13th period of 400 years, known as Baktuns, on the equivalent 
of December 21 2012.

It is believed to refer to the end of a cycle of 5,125 years since the beginning of the Mayan Long Count calendar in 3113 B.C.

The fragment was a prophecy of ruler Bahlam Ajaw, who wanted to plan the passage of the god.

The outspoken warlock also claimed that two more Latin American leaders would contract cancer this year, before announcing that Hugo Chavez would have a 'terible relapse' of his disease in the next 12 months.

Mr Vazquez has also predicted that U.S. President Barack Obama will lose the 2012 election.

He also said Syria would be invaded in 2012, although he would not specify by whom.

In 2008, the Mexican eccentric boldly claimed that Britney Spears would die.

And
last year, although Mr Vazquez foresaw the weakening of the euro and 
recession returning to developed countries, he also wrongly predicted 
that a Latin American leader would be assassinated.
