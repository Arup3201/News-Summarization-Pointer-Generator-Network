Josh Law could have been forgiven for wondering what all the fuss had been about. A mere nine minutes into his competitive debut, he netted Motherwell’s first European goal in four years.

Another swiftly followed to  confirm a positive first impression of the summer signing from  Alfreton Town, who hopes to  replicate the impact elder sibling Nicky made in this parish before exiting for Rangers.

His big brother could have told him, however, that things are rarely that simple when it comes to continental competition.

Delight: Motherwell's Josh Law celebrates his first goal after opening the scoring against Stjarnan

And so it proved. Stuart McCall’s side somehow blew the advantage Law delivered on a night of immense frustration at Fir Park. The turnaround was extraordinary.

Seemingly poised to extend their lead after that early double, the Premiership runners-up lost  direction from the moment Olafur Finsen pulled one back via a  first-half penalty.

The same player then scored again from the spot in injury-time after Motherwell had survived a few second-period scares.

Ultimately, the Icelandic part-timers were worthy of their draw.

From a position of strength, McCall’s men now have significant work to do in Reykjavik next Thursday night if they are to remain in the Europa League.

The draw for the third qualifying round takes place today, but no one at Fir Park will be looking beyond redemption in the second leg of this tie.

Motherwell had previously gone through seven European matches — against Odense, Panathinaikos, Levante and Kuban Krasnodar — without getting on the scoresheet.

Double: Law scores his second goal against Stjarnan

A meeting with Stjarnan  represented a significant drop in class from those opponents but a much-desired victory remained agonisingly elusive.

The undulating first half opened on a note of concern. McCall had spent much of his pre-match deliberations stressing the need to learn from previous European experiences and guard against being picked off on the break.

After a mere four minutes, it seemed those words had fallen on deaf ears. His side forced a corner which resulted in a Lionel  Ainsworth cross being cleared. One crisp pass was all it took for Arnar Bjorgvinsson to be released into swathes of space on the right.

His initial cross was overhit but Daniel Laxdal gathered on the opposite flank and plonked a  perfect delivery on to the head of Veigar Gunnarsson. His woeful miss from six yards proved the equivalent of an alarm call for the Lanarkshire line-up.

Suddenly wide awake in their passing and movement, Motherwell claimed the lead after nine  minutes. It was a landmark goal — after 639 blank minutes in Europe — of simple execution.

John Sutton bullied Niclas  Vemmelund to get on the end of Keith Lasley’s looping centre from the right. When the downward header was parried by goalkeeper Ingvar Jonsson, Law had the easiest of tasks to knock into the net.

It was 2-0 10 minutes later after the hapless Vemmelund slipped near the touchline. Iain Vigurs pinched possession and moved infield, eventually playing a delightful pass to Law inside the area. The assist was given the  finish it deserved as the midfielder dinked first-time over the despairing Jonsson.

Hit the spot: Stjarnan's Olafur Karl Finsen slots a penalty past Dan Twardzik

Motherwell were looking in ebullient form, with Stuart Carswell passing up a more than presentable chance for a third after Sutton’s smart lay-off.

Yet the serene mood inside Fir Park — bathed in sunshine — was fractured 10 minutes before the break.

Danish referee Michael Johansen pointed to the spot when a firm, deflected strike from Gunnarsson struck Lasley’s hand. A booking added insult to his injury.

Finsen dithered slightly in his run-up but produced the perfect penalty, tucked just inside the post as Dan Twardzik threw  himself in the opposite direction.

Worse could — and probably should — have followed for a  previously dominant Motherwell before they were back in the changing room.

A last-ditch challenge from Craig Reid thwarted Finsen, with Twardzik then forced to thrust out a leg out and expertly deny Bjorgvinsson’s drive. Nerves were becoming distinctly frayed.

McCall attempted to apply a soothing balm at half-time but  the flow of the game remained unpredictable. Stephen McManus saw a firm, low shot well held by Jonsson before Stjarnan produced their second glaring miss of the evening.

Bjorgvinsson swept in a terrific cross from the right that found Finsen ideally positioned. Yet he somehow sent a close-range volley wide of the near post to answer Twardzik’s prayers.

Law had begun to hobble a touch and his impressive debut was brought to an end after 69 minutes when he departed alongside winger Ainsworth.

Youngsters Fraser Kerr and Lee Erwin were introduced to the action as Motherwell sought to recapture a spark.

Again, though, it was Finsen who threatened. This time, he was just plain unlucky with a ripping, angled effort that bounced a fraction wide of Twardzik’s right-hand post.

He would, though, have his  second goal as Stjarnan snatched a dramatic leveller in the first minute of added time.

Again, Lasley was penalised, this time for a foul on substitute Rolf Toft. Once more, Finsen was  perfectly cool from 12 yards to send a ripple of booing around Fir Park at full-time.
