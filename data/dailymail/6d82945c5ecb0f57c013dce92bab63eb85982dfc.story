This is one woman who is truly dedicated to her work.

Eighty year old, Jean Artt, is believed to be Britain's oldest dinner lady, having worked as a lunchtime supervisor for 48 years at Yorkshire's Middlesbrough Unity City Academy.

Though she started out as a cleaner, as the years went by, she was asked to come in as a dinner nanny to help out - and never looked back.

'Once you get in, you don't get out,' Jean jokes in the video. 'I've been at the school since - well, I'm in my 48th year now.'

'I get on with the kids, get a lot of respect from the kids,' she says. 'And we have a bit of fun.'

Jean, who has a daughter, four grandchildren and four great grandchildren, also reveals that while she takes some teasing from the kids, she also has a lot of respect within the community. 

When asked what some of the names they call her are, Jean responds with a laugh: 'I don't know if I should tell you. Whatever Jean rhymes with, they'll call me.'

'I know a lot of the kids from the estate where we were all brought up,' she adds.

I've been in the house that I'm in now for 56 years. I've always lived here and I've always worked.'

'I'm just a workaholic,' she says.

Joan has worked with all generations of families - and not only that, but she continues to do an amazing job

'She is certainly the most dedicated member of staff we have,' Richard Harrison, Vice-Principal of Middlesbrough Unity City Academy agrees. 

'Over the years, she's probably worked with 9,000 students. 

'Many of our current students, she's worked with their parents and other members of the family. In some cases, grandparents. 

'She's worked with all generations of families.'

'Not only has she been there for that length of time, she also does an amazing job.

'It's a pleasure to have her come to work every day.'
