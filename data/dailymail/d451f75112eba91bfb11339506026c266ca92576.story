The death of a grandmother on a hospital ward is being investigated by police today after her family expressed their fears she had been neglected by medical staff.

Grandmother-of-eight Susan Evans, 75, was found dead in a ward just days after being admitted to Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire.

Mrs Evans's family believe she took her own life, and said that hospital staff should have been aware she had depression and needed to be closely monitored.

Prior to her death, Mrs Evans had also been receiving care at the  Bro Cerwyn psychiatric unit in Haverfordwest.

'We have some very real serious concerns about the standard of care she received at the hospital and the possibility of neglect,' said Mrs Evans's son Bill, 51. 

'She took her own life on the ward while under the care of the health service and serious questions need to be answered.

'We particularly want to know if the type of security she had at Bro Cerwyn was imposed at the hospital.

'We are confident that the police will investigate this thoroughly and the hospital and health authorities will co-operate openly and fully.'

The police inquiry is likely to centre around claims that Mrs Evans, who was a known suicide risk, had been left unchecked for a number of hours prior to her death on November 17.

'One thing that I think my mother would want to come out of this is a result that makes it less likely that it will happen to other families in the future and we have that closely in mind at present,' said Mr Evans, a solicitor at a firm in London. 

'My mother was a gentle, kind lady who because of her problems did a great deal for mental health charities.' 

Mrs Evans had campaigned tirelessly for an improvement in mental health services in the area, had helped set up the psychiatric unit at Bro Cerwyn and worked with Pembrokeshire MIND.

Her funeral at St Mary’s Church at Hakin near Haverfordwest was so well attended that there was an overflow of mourners outside the church.

Police said that Dyfed-Powys officers are investigating the circumstances surrounding Mrs Evans’ death.

A police spokesman said: 'As there is an ongoing investigation it would be inappropriate to comment further.'

Hywel Dda University NHS Health Board is also carrying out an internal investigation, as well as assisting with the police probe.

Chief operating officer Paul Hawkins said: 'We offer our deepest sympathies to the family for their loss.

'We are fully cooperating with the ongoing police investigation so no further comment will be made at this time. In any incident such as this, we conduct a thorough internal investigation.'

Pembrokeshire County Council confirmed that Mrs Evans had been supported by its social services department in the past, but said it had no involvement with her after 2011. 

'A death in these sort of circumstances is very sad and a cause for great concern,' he added.
