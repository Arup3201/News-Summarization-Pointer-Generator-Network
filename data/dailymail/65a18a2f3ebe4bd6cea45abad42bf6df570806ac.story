Scandals: The Duke of York has flown to the Far East with two aides

It is two months since a string of scandals forced Prince Andrew officially to step down as the UK’s global trade ambassador.

Yet it seems little has changed in practice for the royal, dubbed ‘Airmiles Andy’ because of his love of luxury air travel.

Just three days after returning from an expensive ‘trade mission’ to Saudi Arabia, the Duke of York is on his taxpayer-funded travels again – this time to promote British business in Singapore.

He and two aides have flown nearly 7,000 miles to the Far  East, where he aims to boost ‘high-level bilateral relations between the UK and Singapore, in particular in relation to trade and investment’.

Only last week, Andrew was accused of wasting public  money after spending up to £150,000 to charter a private jet to fly him to the Middle East, where he met Saudi businessmen and politicians.

The prince was forced to relinquish his official trade title in July following criticism over his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, as well as claims of boorish behaviour towards foreign dignitaries.

He then created a new job for himself – as a ‘senior working royal’ with a particular interest in British business – which critics claimed was a ploy to enable him to continue his trips abroad.

Andrew flew out to Singapore on a scheduled flight from Heathrow on Monday night and is not due to return to the UK until Saturday.

Taxpayers will pick up his travel costs to Singapore, while UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) will pay the bill for his ‘accommodation and expenses and any in-country travel’.

UKTI officials at last night defended the trip, pointing out that Singapore is the UK’s 19th largest market in terms of UK goods exports.

But cynics pointed out that with its tropical climate, fantastic array of golf courses and first-class hotels and restaurants, there may be other incentives for making the twelve-and-a-half hour flight.

Records show that Prince Andrew has visited Singapore every year since at least 2007, making it one of his most popular destinations.

The Court Circular said he was accompanied on his latest trip by Deputy Private Secretary Amanda Thirsk and an Assistant Private Secretary, Richard Sykes. As is custom, it did not mention whether any domestic staff or protection officers were in his entourage.

Dai Davies, former head of Scotland Yard’s Royalty Protection Squad – and one of Prince Andrew’s fiercest critics – said last night: ‘Trips like these, which involve first-class travel and five-star hotels, as well as the presence of protection officers and various aides, are very expensive.

‘There needs to be a proper evaluation of whether they provide value for money. I am not convinced they provide any real benefit. At a time when people are trying to cut back, Prince Andrew – despite the scandals which have engulfed him – is carrying on as if nothing has changed.’

The prince’s spokesman said: ‘The visit to Singapore was agreed before the Duke relinquished the role of Special Representative in July. The Foreign Office agreed that it should continue and it has been approved by the Royal Visits Committee.’
