It has long laid claim to being Britain's 'favourite cheese'.

And while Cathedral City cheddar may not be found in the fridge of many cheese connoisseurs, it seems the boast is not far from the truth.

It is now one of Britain's top 20 most highly-rated brands, according to a survey.

The scale of the product's spiralling popularity in recent years has been revealed after it beat some of the biggest names in British retailing - including Waterstone's, Colgate and Dyson to claim 13th place in the YouGov survey.

Cathedral City chedder cheese has been rated one of Britain's top brands in a new poll

The product is made from a 25-year-old recipe in Davidstow, in Cornwall -  which is not a city, nor does it have a Cathedral.

And it's confirmed popularity will come as a massive 
boost to makers Dairy Crest, who spent tens of millions of pounds on a 
nationwide TV and radio advertising campaign.

Sales of the cheese hit more than £230m last year, accounting for 10 per cent of the nation's cheese market.

The brand has also used social media to further its appeal and now has 14,000 followers on its Facebook page.

The value of Cathedral City sales have risen by nearly 80 per cent over the past four years and the cheese, which is cut and packaged in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, is now used in one in three British households.

Google was knocked off top spot in the YouGov poll by online retail giant Amazon

Food giant Dairy Crest now has an annual turnover of £1.6b, with Cathedral City among its most successful products.

Online retail giant Amazon, used by 
millions of Britons each year, came first in YouGov's 2012 BrandIndex 
poll, knocking last year's winner Google off of top spot in the table.

Two thousand people were questioned for the poll, giving their views on quality, value, customer satisfaction, corporate reputation, general impression and recommendation, for each brand.

All of the brands listed beat more than 850 other big names to make it into the top 20 of the bi-annual survey.

Electronics firm Sony slipped a couple of places from sixth in last year's table to eighth this time, while rivals Samsung came in 14th spot.

British firms fared well, with the innovative vacuum-maker Dyson taking 19th position, supermarket chain Sainsbury's came 11th while trusted high street retailer John Lewis took seventh place.

Some of the favourite brands from last year slipped out of the top twenty altogether, with 
Thornton's, Walker's, Panasonic and Dove all losing their places.
