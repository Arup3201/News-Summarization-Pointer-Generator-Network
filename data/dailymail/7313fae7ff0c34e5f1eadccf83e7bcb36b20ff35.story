The battle is on... George Clooney versus Pepper the robot.

While Nespresso has the Hollywood heartthrob to promote its coffee, Nescafe has looked to the future and employed a humanoid robot to draw crowds.

This month Pepper starts its role to help sell  coffee machines in home appliance stores in Japan.

The sleek, all-white robot, has a tablet mounted to its chest, and can chat with customers about their coffee habits and preferences.

Although Pepper many not appear on the silver screen, she (or he) is billed as the first robot in the world that is able to read and respond to human emotion. 

Equipped with the latest voice and emotion recognition technology, Pepper is able to read people's facial expressions and listen to their tone of voice to analyse how they're feeling.

'Pepper will be able to explain Nescafé products and services and engage in conversation with consumers. I hope that this new consumer engagement model will expand across the world as an example of Japanese innovation' said Kohzoh Takaoka, President and CEO of Nestlé Japan.

'The dream to create an advanced consumer experience with Pepper is now coming true. 

'We hope that by providing people the opportunity to interact with a robot whilst shopping, we can help create experiences of wonder and delight for consumers' said Masayoshi Son, Chairman and CEO of SoftBank Corporation. 

Engineers claim that the robot, which retails at 198,000 yen ($1,650), can understand 80 percent of conversations and has the ability to learn from conversations.

The technology will 'help us discover consumer needs through conversations between our customers and Pepper,' said a joint statement from Nestle and SoftBank, whose French operation Aldebaran developed the robot.

Nestlé is planning to use the robot nationwide in around 1,000 stores by the end of 2015.
