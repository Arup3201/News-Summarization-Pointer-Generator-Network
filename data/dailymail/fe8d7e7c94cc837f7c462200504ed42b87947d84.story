Morocco has been expelled from the 2015 African Cup of Nations after refusing to host the football tournament due to fears over it helping to spread the deadly Ebola virus.

The North African country failed to meet yesterday's deadline to announce it would be hosting the tournament, with the Confederation of African Football saying it is now considering other nations.

The news comes after Morocco's Ministry of Sport demanded the tournament be postponed for a year amid the world's worst ever Ebola outbreak - with the virus already infecting more than 13,000 people and killing almost 5,000 in the three worst-hit countries, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

Following news that Morocco had been expelled from the tournament, the Confederation of African Football says it has received 'some applications' from possible replacement hosts. 

It did not say who the candidates were, but added that it had refused Morocco's request to postpone the African Cup until 2016.

The Confederation went on to say that it will decide on further punishments for Morocco for breaching its contractual obligations as host.

 Last week it had ruled unanimously that the competition should go ahead, despite the health threat.

The confederation pointed out that of the three countries worst effected by the disease, only Sierra Leone can still qualify, adding that there have been no incidents of Ebola in Morocco.

There have been reports of a drop in the numbers of new Ebola cases in Liberia, but Médecins Sans Frontières is warning against complacency, saying the outbreak is far from over. 

New hotspots are emerging around the country all the time, said MSF and in Guinea, where there were two significant dips in cases, the numbers have risen again. 

However the African Cup of Nations, which is usually held every two years, will lead to a huge pan-continental movement of people - the like of which has not been seen since the current outbreak started in the West African nation of Guinea in March.

This has led to concerns that those travelling from or via countries hit by Ebola could contract the virus and carry it with them to Morocco, where they will be exposed to huge numbers of people in football stadiums, who could then spread the illness still further.
