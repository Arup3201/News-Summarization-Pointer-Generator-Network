A teenager shoved a puppy face down into a bucket of freezing water in a mimic of the ‘ice bucket challenge’ fundraising craze.

In a clip posted online, the dog could be seen desperately trying to wriggle free, yelping as her owner thrust her into the water.

During the 19-second video the youth from London says: ‘Here’s my dog and she’s doing the ice bucket challenge. She wants to nominate all the other dogs here and all the cats as well, yeah.’

The RSPCA is investigating after a video emerged of a teenager dunking a puppy in a bucket of water in a cruel twist on the charity ice bucket challenge

The teenager holds the puppy by the throat and displays it for the camera before dunking it in the bucket

Taking the dog under his arm, the teenager turns and slams the poor pet into the water

The barefoot teenager then asks the 
puppy, ‘You ready?’, before throwing her into the bucket with such force
 he loses his footing.

His 
stunt copies the ‘ice bucket challenge’, in which people film themselves
 being doused in freezing water to raise money and awareness for ALS – a
 type of motor neurone disease – before daring others to do the same. 
But the RSPCA is investigating and said it was likely the dog had been 
harmed.

Facebook users branded the video ‘awful’ and ‘just wrong’.

Beverley
 Cuddy, 52, said: ‘It really upset me the way it was plunged 
headfirst … People are appalled by it and it’s the sort of thing that 
could spark an awful trend and be replicated. It’s one thing to put 
yourself through discomfort but pets don’t have a choice.

‘Lots
 of people complained to Facebook but they simply said it did not 
contravene their rules on violence … It’s awful, it’s just wrong.’  

The water inside the bucket splashes on to the road as the dog crashes head first inside

The
 clip, which has since been taken down by the teenager, was shared more 
than 1,000 times on the social media site and was posted to YouTube, 
prompting outrage from internet users.

Saskia
 Booth described the clip as ‘just awful’ and Anna Stimson said: 
‘Throwing her in headfirst like that is harsh.’ Shannon Beardon wrote on
 Facebook: ‘That’s mean.’ The youngster replied: ‘I sorry my dog sliped 
out my hand [sic].’

An RSPCA
 spokesman said: ‘The aim of the ice bucket challenge is to raise money 
and awareness for charity – this “stunt” goes against everything it 
stands for.

‘Any 
responsible pet owner would be shocked by this. It is likely that the 
puppy in the footage could have been caused distress, if not 
harm … Causing unnecessary suffering to an animal is an offence under 
law and we would strongly urge people not to copy this video.’

Earlier
 this year Ben Elphick and Gavin Hope were fined for causing unnecessary
 suffering to goldfish by swallowing them in a ‘NekNominate’ video. The 
craze, which was not for charity, began with internet users daring each 
to other to down mixtures of alcohol.
