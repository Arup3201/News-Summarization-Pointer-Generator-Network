Fizz for a fiver? Chefs Heston Blumenthal and Jamie Oliver say a decent bubbly can be yours for exactly this price — thanks to the 1970s drinks gadget SodaStream. 

They swear it can turn an average plonk into a drink tasting exactly like champagne. Jamie explains: ‘If you put an OK bottle of wine in the SodaStream, it will bubble up to be much better than an OK champagne.’  

And in a blind test, Heston fooled members of the public into thinking they were drinking champagne after putting a £5.25 bottle of Blue Nun through the gadget.

The method is simple — decant the wine into the bottle, pop it in the machine, then press the button to add carbon dioxide. But does it work? We asked Femail wine expert and author of The Knackered Mother’s Wine Club, Helen McGinn, to test it out on white and rose supermarket wines.

There were so many bubbles it looked like Alka Seltzer at first. But they soon calmed down and lasted a good hour in the bottle. The fizz really enhanced the fresh apple and pear aromas! You could easily pass this off as a dry £10 Prosecco.    

Score: 8/10

This is fantastic. It has more flavour and weight than the Pinot, and the result is more interesting. Golden in the glass, the bubbles bring out the apple flavours. It reminds me of sparkling Chenins from the Loire Valley, which cost at least £12. 

Score: 8/10

This simple, dry rose is super sippable as it is, so I did wonder if bubbles would make it any better. The answer was, not really. The bubbles diluted the delicate strawberry flavours.                                        

Score: 5/10

Fan of the fizz: Jamie Oliverl believes you can make your own bubbly at home for much less than buying it in the shops

A smart, refreshing wine, made from Chenin Blanc and grown in France’s Loire Valley. Adding bubbles really intensifies the aroma and I loved the lemony aftertaste. It could pass for a smart French fizz.     

Score: 7/10

As this is a Chardonnay — one of the main grapes used in champagne — you’d think it would work with bubbles. But the wine lost its personality, which it has in spades without bubbles — golden in the glass, with ripe lemon flavours.        

Score: 4/10

This Spanish wine is a juicy beast loaded with red fruit flavours. Add bubbles and you have a rose that tastes divine. The colour is precious-stone pink and with bubbles looks even more appealing. This could easily pass for a £10 bubbly. 

Score: 10/10

Not even a blast of gas could perk this up. In fact, there’s a medicinal taste and the big bubbles don’t make it go down any easier. Don’t waste your gas. In fact, don’t waste your money in the first place.              

Score: 1/10

I’m strangely fond of this. Get past the blue bottle and inside is a lovely light white with a touch of sweetness. It already has a slight spritz, so does it need another blast of bubbles? Heston may disagree but I prefer it unadulterated.        

Score: 5/10

Bottle your own bubbly: Chef Heston Blumenthal fooled members of the public into thinking they were drinking champagne after putting a £5.25 bottle of Blue Nun through a SodaSteam

This really does what it says on the label. It’s a crisp, floral wine and so works well with the bubbles — it has instant aromatic appeal. The flavours are crisper than Prosecco, but it’s refreshingly good.         

Score: 9/10

This Spanish rose is bright and juicy, and the colour is to die for. Sweetheart pink, with strawberry and raspberry flavours, the bubbles create a taste explosion! The colour is more intense than many pink Proseccos. Turn the lights down and your guests will never know.  

Score: 9/10

As a long-time champagne lover, I thought it was impossible to produce anything nearly as good. But I’m converted. This can’t give you instant champagne. But it will make cheap wine bubbilicious. Overall, the single grapes worked best. The only thing missing in most cases was the pop of a cork!SodaStream £49.99-149.99,  sodastream.co.uk
