Curiosity - or greediness - almost got the better of this brazen cat.

Denis Ovcharenko from Russia filmed his kitten Marquise jumping up on a desk in a bid to get his paws on a couple of ice cream sandwiches.  

Footage shows the feline mischievously tiptoeing backwards as he hauls away one of the frozen treats  to demolish.

But as he retreats, he fails to realize he's reached the desk's edge.

Suddenly his back feet go and then his entire body disappears from view as he tumbles to the ground.

The ice cream sandwich is left upturned on the wooden counter top with a small bite missing.

Marquise's owner can be heard laughing as he watches the scene unfold.

But never fear; it appears that the Himalayan cat lived to tell the tail.

A video uploaded to YouTube after the ice cream sandwich incident shows the pet seemingly dancing on his back legs to a power ballad.
