There are still hundreds of thousands of new cases of leprosy across the globe every year. Here, a man in Uganda suffers from the disease

Leprosy has plagued mankind throughout history, but is far, far older than stories about the disease in the Bible, according to scientists.

A new study claims the disease is probably the oldest infectious disease in humans with roots stretching back millions of years.

A scientist at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre in Houston found that two leprosy-causing bacteria came from a last common bacterial ancestor around 10 million years ago and that ancient humans and hominids suffered from the disease.

There are still hundreds of thousands of new cases of leprosy across the globe every year, which attacks a sufferer’s skin and nerves. If left untreated it can lead to disabilities and even death.

In 2008 pathologist Xiang-Yang Han discovered a new leprosy bacteria and since then has analysed 20 genes of Mycobacterium lepromatosis and the better known Mycobacterium leprae bacteria.

His team found that the two bacteria came from a last common ancestor around 10 million years ago, according to the study in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.

Before this point it is thought that the common bacteria ancestor underwent a massive reductive evolution that resulted in inactivation of approximately 40 per cent of all the genes in its genome.

Together with Francisco Silva, of the University of Valencia’s Evolutionary Genetics Unit, Professor Han said that leprosy is a strict human disease that stretches back millions of years.

They came up with the theory based upon a number of pieces of evidence.

Leprosy is an infectious disease that causes severe, disfiguring skin sores and nerve damage in the arms and legs.

The disease has been around since the beginning of time, often surrounded by frightening, negative stigma and tales of leprosy patients being shunned as outcasts.

At one time or another, outbreaks of leprosy have affected people on every continent, according to NHS Choices.

The oldest civilisations of China, Egypt and India feared leprosy was an incurable, mutilating and contagious disease.

However, leprosy is surprisingly not highly contagious. It can only be caught by coming into close contact with nose and mouth droplets from someone with untreated, severe leprosy.

Although rarely seen in the UK, the World Health Organisation says more than 200,000 people worldwide are infected with leprosy - most of them in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Leprosy bacteria cannot live outside the human body - with the rare exception of wild armadillos thought to have been infected by American explorers a few hundred years ago.

Over 400 strains of Mycobacterium leprae analysed so far have been found to have virtually identical genomes, suggesting that human beings carried the leprosy bacteria when departing Africa around 100,000 years ago to populate the rest of the world.

This means that leprosy bacteria are extraordinarily stable within their human hosts - a sign of mature parasitic life far older than 100,000 years.

The oldest age of the leprosy bacteria’s pseudogenes suggest that gene inactivation began approximately 20 million years ago, which is probably the point when the ancestor of leprosy bacteria jumped to our early human ancestors and transitioned from free-living to strictly parasitic.

The duo’s hypothesis that leprosy existed for millions of years offers new insights into disease pathogenesis.

The parasitic adaptation of the leprosy bacteria inside hominid-human hosts is similar to a very long hide-and-seek game.

The parasite would have hidden by mutating or removing harmful molecules while retaining protective ones, which in the end lead to evasion from host immunity - a phenomenon commonly seen in leprosy.

Professors Han and Silva concluded that leprosy can be viewed as a natural consequence of a long parasitism.

Professor Han said: Discovering the new leprosy agent Mycobacterium lepromatosis was incidental. However, locating this additional leprosy cause significantly adds to our understanding of the ancient disease.

‘In particular, tracing the ultimate origin of leprosy through the parasitic adaptive evolution of the leprosy bacteria is rather insightful, not only for this single disease but also for our better understanding of the mechanism behind other human infections.'
