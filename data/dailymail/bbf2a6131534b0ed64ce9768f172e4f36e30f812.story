Babies in special care units may soon be able to stay close to their mothers thanks to a revolutionary incubator design.

The hi-tech BabyBloom can be fitted across the bed of a new mother allowing her to bond with her baby even as it needs to be in the special environment of an incubator.

Such close proximity allows both mother and child get to know each other by visual contact, touch and even smell.

The incubator can be adjusted to a myriad of positions making it more comfortable for both parents and nursing staff.

And the device is considerably quieter than regular incubators, allowing the newborn to get some much-needed sleep.

A spokesman for Dutch company BabyBloom said: 'This intimate contact is of great importance to mother’s well-being and the development and healing of the incubator child.

'Why settle for a situation where a 
mother can hardly see or touch her child because she can’t get out of 
bed in the first difficult hours or days after birth?

'Why should technology stand in the way of the crucial bonding process between parent and child?'

The BabyBloom also comes with an innovative climate system makes it quieter than other incubators.

It produces less than 40 decibels, comparable with the noise level in a library.

Three-side panels and two smaller 
observation windows can be opened or closed independently, allowing a 
balance between protection and observation of the child’s condition.

It also has a built-in camera to 
observe the child on a display on a remote location, such as the nurses’
desk, a computer at home or even on a mobile phone.

And, to ensure immediate and 
unlimited access to the patient, the complete light and noise protective
hood can be removed with a single press of a button.
