A principal at a prestigious prep school in Rhode Island has unleashed his inner artist to perform a parody of Frozen's Let It Go which is now going viral.

Matt Glendinning, 50, from Moses Brown School in Providence starred in the comical music video to announce that lessons are off due to heavy snowfall from winter storm Juno.

For more than four minutes he enthusiastically sings about the icy weather, while wrapped up in a snazzy knitted hat, glove and scarf ensemble.

'The snow glows white on Route 95, not a tire track to be seen. We could make you come to school but that would just be mean,' he chimes to the camera.

At one point he grabs a sleigh to do a spot of sledging in the playground and later he sits inside with a cup of cocoa.

'Today no Moses Brown for me, I'm free!' Glendinning continues. 

He also encourages students to either 'stay in bed and sleep' or 'read an engaging book'.

Adam Olenn, the school’s director of public relations, was the man behind the quirky song.

He told WBUR News that he sat down and wrote the lyrics in 15 minutes. As a father of two young girls he was familiar with the hit Frozen song.

Although Glendinning looks like he’s singing in the video, the voice viewers are actually hearing is the school’s choral director, Justin Peters.

Boundless energy: At one point Glendinning grabs a sleigh to do a spot of sledging and later he sits inside with a cup of cocoa - to date his music video has been watched more than 160,000 times 

The finished video took just over a week to put together and was uploaded on January 26. 

To date, it has been watched more than 160,000 times. Many viewers have applauded the quirky idea.

'I want to give this video more than one thumbs up!' one fan wrote. 'Absolutely charming,' added another.

Apparently parents were called about the snow day and sent an email with a link to the video.

The National Weather Service said it had received reports of 11 inches of snow in Providence. 

Maximum accumulation is expected to reach 25 inches, a lower range than had  been forecast. All of Rhode Island remains under a blizzard warning until 1am Wednesday.

We could make you come to school but that would just be mean. 

The plows are running but still traffic starts to slide.

So don't come to school, just stay inside. 

Don't come to school I am free today, the snow has set you free.

It's true no school just stay at home. You can stay at home.

School is closed, school is closed! Cos' it snowed so much last night.

School is closed, school is closed! So stay at home sit tight.

Stay inside or go out and play, gonna grab my sleigh. The cold never bothered me anyway.

 

Its funny how some snowflakes can bring things to a crawl.

And the streets that once ran smoothly become a tangled brawl.

It's time for fires and cocoa too, to read an engaging book or two. 

Today no Moses Brown for me, I'm free! 

School is closed, school is closed! Because the snow's too deep.

School is closed, school is closed! You can stay in bed and sleep.

Here I'll snooze and here I'll stay, let the storm rage on.

 

This feeling flurries through the air into the ground.

While Dr Cruisin shows us frozen fractals all around.

Though this hard hits me like an icy frozen blast,

We'll soon be going back when this storm has passed. 

School is closed, school is closed! Don't come to school at dawn. 

School is closed, school is closed! So stay at home with slippers on.

And hold your seat there's no school today. 

Let the storm rage on, the cold never bothered me anyway.
