The Church of Scientology has vehemently denied extraordinary claims that their leader David Miscavige called Nicole Kidman a gold digger who had faked her conversion to the religion.

In a new book, Pulitzer Prize winning author Lawrence Wright alleges the comments were made about the 45-year-old actress when she was married to Scientology devotee Tom Cruise.

He goes on to claim that Miscavige had described her as a ‘suppressive’ person and was hopeful that the actor, now 50, could be ‘peeled away' from her.'

Both the Church and Miscavige have issued a robust denial of the allegations made in Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood & the Prison of Belief, which will by published by Knopf on January 17 with a reported print run of 150,000 copies.

Love life: The book claims Scientology boss David Miscavige went to extreme lengths to keep Cruise and Nicole Kidman happy when the pair were married

Allegations: Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood & the Prison of Belief by Lawrence Wright will be published on January 17

A British version of the book has been cancelled after publisher Transworld took legal advice.

Karin Poew, a Church representative 
said: ‘Wright's book would be better suited for supermarket tabloids 
because they are nothing more than a stale rehash of allegations 
disproven long ago.

‘It is important to note that Wright's
 British publisher had second thoughts, choosing not to publish Wright's
 book after being informed of the numerous inaccuracies and defamatory 
lies it contains that were told to Wright by a handful of bitter and 
discredited former Scientologists.’

Inside Scientology: Author Lawrence Wright

Wright’s highly-anticipated book is 
based on his 2011 New Yorker article ‘The Apostate’, for which he 
interviewed the screenwriter and director Paul Haggis about his decision
 to resign from the organisation.

It examines the Church’s founder, L. 
Ron Hubbard, the church’s finances and its relationships with 
celebrities such as Cruise and John Travolta.

The first excerpt of the tome, published in  The Hollywood Reporter
 this week, alleges that Miscavige attempted to cultivate Cruise to 
become a spiritual leader - and was 'bedazzled' by the glamour 
surrounding the star, who introduced him to a social life outside 
Scientology, including use of his private jet and set visits.

In turn, Cruise ploughed millions of 
dollars into the church and attempted to lobby foreign leaders - 
including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair - to promote 
Scientology. The book claims that the actor submitted to hours of 
'auditing'  - where followers are given 'spiritual counselling - in the 
run up to his split from Nicole in 2001.

It had been previously alleged that 
Cruise and Nicole's adopted children Isabella and Conor, both brought up
 as devout Scientologists, were told their mother was a 'supressive' 
person - a spiritually toxic person to be avoided.

Members of the Church quietly 
instilled this idea into the kids, who were just eight and six at the 
time of their parents split,  to try and turn them against Nicole, 
sources claimed to Vanity Fair last September.

The Church strongly denied the claims,
 publishing online an eight-page letter which it sent to the magazine in
 which it accused the writer Maureen Orth of ‘shoddy journalism’.

After an intensive five days hours of 
auditing in October 1998, according to the new book, Cruise 'went quiet'
 until he and Nicole were in England, filming Eyes Wide Shut.

Out of the blue, former Scientologist 
and church official Marty Rathbun, who oversaw Cruise's auditing, 
received a call from the star in January 2001 asking for help - and 
revealing that he and Nicole had split.

Cruise's 'renewed dedication' to 
Scientology following the breakdown of his near 10-year marriage to 
Nicole, resulted in Miscaviage and the actor becoming 'closer than 
ever', as the book alleges the church leader flew with Cruise in the 
Warner Bros. jet to a test screening of The Last Samurai in Arizona.

While in July 2004, Miscavige hosted a
 42nd birthday party for Cruise aboard the Scientology cruise ship 
Freewinds, with the book noting: 'Musicians, including Miscavige's 
father, played songs from the actor's films as clips played on giant 
screens. Cruise himself danced and sang 'Old Time Rock and Roll, 
reprising his famous scene from Risky Business.'

In Vanity Fair, in 2004, Miscaviage 
was alleged to have set up a team to help Cruise find a girlfriend. They
 claimed that the church discovered aspiring actress Nazanin Boniadi, a 
25-year-old Iranian-born, London-raised beauty whose mother was also a 
Scientologist.

It was said that she was given 
intensive auditing and security checks by the Church and flown to New 
York and Cruise's Colorado estate in Telluride in late 2007 for dates 
with the star.

But the brief romance ended when 
Nazanin asked Miscavige to repeat himself while they were talking - 
which was considered a huge slight

However the Vanity Fair claims were 
vehemently denied by Mr Miscavige and the Church who said: ‘The entire 
story is hogwash. There was no project, secret or otherwise, ever 
conducted by the church to find a bride (audition or otherwise) for any 
member of the church.’

Mr Cruise has also poured cold water on these allegations.

The latest book claims that she] was 
given a 'dressing down' by Cruise for 'disrespecting' the Church leader,
 as the book said he told her: 'You don't get it, it goes like this,' 
Cruise said. He raised his hand over his head. 'First there's LRH ' (L 
Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology).He moved his hand down a few 
inches. 'Then there is COB' (Chairman of the board, Miscavige). Bringing
 his hand down at his own eye level, he said 'Then there's me'. [ADD: 
Cruise's attorney has vehemently denied that this exchange took place or
 that the Church set him up].

It was only a few months later that 
Cruise met Katie Holmes and the pair were married in November 2006 
following the birth of their daughter Suri. Miscavige was Cruise's best 
man at the ceremony in Rome.

Katie, 34, stunned Cruise by filling 
for divorce last June and has since then moved her little girl to New 
York City, with reports claiming that she did not want their 
six-year-old daughter to grow up in Scientology.

The author of the new book is no 
stranger to investigating secretive organisations. He won the Pulitzer 
Prize in 2007 for his book The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 
9/11.

A field full of a wildflowers and a romantic 'fairy-tale' bungalow made for two: How David Miscavige tried to woo Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman

In the mid 1990s, Scientology leader David Miscavige tried to woo Cruise and his then wife Nicole  Kidman with a 'completely deferential environment as spotless and odorless as a fairy tale', according to Lawrence Wright's book.

A romantic bungalow was especially built for the couple at Gold Base, Scientology's desert outpost near Hemet, California.

When he heard about Cruise and Nicole's fantasy of running through a field of wildflowers together, Miscavige had Sea Org - whose members dress in military-style uniforms, a throwback to their original purpose as L Ron Hubbard's private navy - to plant a section of the desert with the blooms.

When that failed to meet his expectations, the meadow was plowed and sodded with grass.

However, former Scientologist Marty Rathbun told how he was against the 'endless courtship' of Cruise - especially after he returned to the Church.

In a bubble: Nicole Kidman said she was heartbroken when she split from Tom Cruise, seen togther at the Oscars in March 2000

The book claims: 'He told Miscavige 'I think I'm done with this guy.' Miscavige responded: 'He'll he done when he calls me'. Rathbun believes the leader was galled by the fact that Cruise had never contacted him when he came back for counseling.'

It adds: 'Miscavige showed his instinctive understanding of how to cater to the sense of entitlement that comes with stardom.'

In November, Nicole -now married to country singer Keith Urban with whom she has two young daughters - gave a rare glimpse into her split from Cruise

She married the actor in 1990 when she was just 23 and told DuJour magazine that after their break-up, 'It took me a very long time to heal. It was a shock to my system...I was totally smitten - I fell madly, passionately in love.

'I was reeling with Tom. I would have gone to the ends of the earth for him...I was so impulsive and naïve.'

The Australian star added: 'We were in a bubble, just the two of us.'

There were hints of why the marriage might have gone wrong after nearly 10 years. Cruise, after all, is the most famous Scientologist in the world. Kidman grew up Catholic and remains devout, saying: 'We were a close-knit family — still are,' adding that she still lives by the Ten Commandments.
