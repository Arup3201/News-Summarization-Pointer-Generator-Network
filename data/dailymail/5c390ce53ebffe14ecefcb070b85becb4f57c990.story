Smells can influence our views - and a particularly pungent one can increase our conservatism and even change our views on same sex marriage, it has been claimed.

In a new study, titled 'Disgust and the Politics of Sex,' researchers say that an odour really can change our mind - and even change our religious views.

The team tested a range of view on people both with and without exposing them to noxious fumes.

A terrible smell can increase our conservatism and even change our views on same sex marriage, it has been claimed.

The researchers tested their theory with the use of a noxious smell.

Of the 57 participants, consisting of community members and students recruited via an online ad and paid $10 for their time, 30 were randomly chosen for the control group and the remaining 27 were in the variable group.

The variable group was exposed to a stench caused by butyric acid, the smell found in rancid butter and sweat, that was placed on hidden cotton pads in the room.

'Disgust has been implicated as a potential causal agent underlying socio-political attitudes and behaviors,' the University of Arkansas team wrote in the journal PLOS One.

'The present study tested the effects of disgust on a range of policy preferences to clarify whether disgust is generally implicated in political conservatism across public policy attitudes or is uniquely related to specific content domains.'

The team say their unusual research proved the theory.

'The study showed that exposure to a disgusting odor increased endorsement of socially conservative attitudes related to sexuality,' they wrote.

'In particular, there was a strong and consistent link between induced disgust and less support for gay marriage.'

The researchers tested their theory with the use of a particularly offensive smell.

Of the 57 participants, consisting of community members and students recruited via an online ad and paid $10 for their time, 30 were randomly chosen for the control group and the remaining 27 were in the variable group.

The variable group was exposed to a stench caused by butyric acid, the smell found in rancid butter and sweat, that was placed on hidden cotton pads in the room.

Participants were asked 'If a close friend of family member were gay, I would support their right to having a same-sex marriage?' - both with and without a noxious smell present.

They say the results were shocking.

'In the research presented here, exposure to a disgusting odor caused greater endorsement of conservative views, including: rejecting gay marriage, restricting sex to marriage, disapproving of the use of pornography, and increased beliefs in Biblical truth.

'Rejection of gay marriage was a particularly strong response to the disgust-inducing odor, perhaps because of the connection between homosexuality and perceptions of sexual impurity.

'It is possible that some forms of political conservatism, particularly those related to sex and sexuality, are basic and inherent in some populations and can readily emerge under threatening or taxing conditions.'

Used butyric acid, the smell found in rancid butter and sweat, to test theory

Those exposed to smell more likely to reject gay marriage, restrict sex to marriage, disapprove of the use of pornography, and believe in Biblical truth
