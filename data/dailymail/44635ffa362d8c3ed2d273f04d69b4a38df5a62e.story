These photographs capture the retreat of glaciers in one of America's most beautiful national parks.

After 100 years of climate change, only 25 out of the 150 glaciers recorded at the Glacier National Park in Montana still exist.

As these pictures show, places where the ice was once many metres thick have been replaced with sediment, pastures and lakes.

Right, by 2008 a man looks down from the same spot and can see lakes and sediment there were previously hidden beneath metres of ice

Shrunken: The Grinnell glacier had greatly receded by 2008

Going: By 2010 it had receded to reveal the great swathes of sediment beneath

Dr Dan Fagre, who leads the U.S. 
Geological Survey Team responsible for researching glaciers in the park,
predicts that its glaciers will completely disappear in the coming 
decades.

He believes they are melting because of natural climate changes 'accelerated' by human influence.

'The mountains are still very beautiful and they are a legacy of glaciers carving them and sculpting them,' he said.

'But there would most definitely be an irony that it was a glacier-less glacier national park.'

The disappearance of the ice is likely to further affect the wider ecosystem and could threaten species of fish adapted to living in waters kept cold by the glaciers, he added.

The USGS yesterday warned as much as 44billion tons of nitrogen and 850billion tons of carbon could be released into the environment as permafrost thaws over the next century.

This release of greenhouse gases could make much worse and threaten delicate water systems on land and offshore, the scientists said.

Their warning came after the UN last week warned of record levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which will likely remain trapped there causing temperatures to continue to rise for centuries.

Global warming: The glacier is still the park's largest, but its disappearance now leaves massive sections of mountain visible

These photographs, known as glacier pairs or repeat photographs, show the tangible effects of the rising climate believed to be caused by the accumulation of so many pollutants.

They have been taken from the same vantage points or fields of view, but with some of the originals dating back as far as 1900, to document how global warming is affecting glaciers.

And the same phenomenon is being repeated all over the world, according to Dr Jonathan Bamber, a glacier expert from the University of Bristol.

'The retreating glaciers seen in these photos are common to most mountain glaciers around the world including examples from the European Alps, the Himalaya and tropical glaciers in the Andes,' he said.

'Part of the retreat is likely due to natural causes but part is also likely due to human induced warming of the planet over the last century.'
