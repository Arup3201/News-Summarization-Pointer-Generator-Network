In the first glimpse inside the Cairns  'house of horrors', where eight children  were stabbed to death, neighbours have described the kids as pranksters who made everyone smile.

Among the children who were brutally murdered there was a shy, grade-A student who loved rugby league, a teenage tomboy whose favourite colour was pink and a beautiful baby girl, who was the apple of the family's eye.

The children, who lived with their mother at 34 Murray St, Manoora, were brutally murdered on Friday in a horrific massacre, which has devastated the small community.

Their mother, Mersane Warria, was taken to hospital and has since been charged with their murder after allegedly stabbing and suffocating seven of her children to death, along with her niece.

The 37-year-old local woman was charged with eight counts of murder, and appeared before a magistrate in a bedside hearing at the Cairns Base Hospital this morning.

The woman was remanded in police custody, and currently remains in hospital. 

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Jade, a neighbour of the family, gushed about the little kids while struggling to come to terms with the tragedy.

'They were such pranksters those boys. In a good way - they were funny. They made everyone smile,' she said. 

'They'd hide in this tree and get me with a super soaker - they'd spray me with the water gun and laugh and laugh.'

Speaking about the youngest four boys, Daniel, Rodney, Rayden and 'Az' she explains how they often came to her door alone, asking 'can we see your dogs?'

'They'd ride my big dog around like it was a horse - they were sweet little boys.'

She couldn't find words to explain the little child, Petronella, who was just two years old when she was killed.

'She was so little... Just a little baby,' she said. 

Cristal Atkinson, who babysat for the family for two years, has fond memories of the children, remembering their love for playing in the local park and watching Disney movies. 

Speaking to the Courier Mail Ms Atkinson spoke about two-year-old Petronella, who was doted on by her older siblings. 

She said they found it hard to pronounce her long name, so they called her 'Baby Girl'. 

'Everybody doted on her because she was the baby,' she said.

The eight children who were stabbed to death in the Cairns 'house of horrors' have been described as loving kids who were full of laughter and were always dancing and singing

A woman, believed to be a member of the family, is visibly upset as she visits the scene of the stabbing in Manoora in Cairns 

7-year-old Rayden was the academic one of the bunch, receiving A-grades in every class. However he was 'very quiet' and shy, preferring to stay in the background and let his siblings take the limelight.

Younger brother Daniel, was the complete opposite to Rayden and was the joker of the group.

'He'd spray whipped cream on my hand when I was asleep and push it towards my nose. He was a really happy, fun-loving kid,' she said. 

Ms Atkinson was closest to 14-year-old Malili, who went to Trinity Bay State High. The teenager has been described as a tough girl who loved pink and AFL. 

'She was a solid girl – you wouldn't want to mess with her – who played rugby league and loved AFL. But her favourite colour was floral pink and I bought her a bright pink shirt for Christmas.' 

Neighbour, Jade, told Daily Mail Australia that she couldn't understand why the 37-year-old mother didn't ask for help before her stabbing rampage.  

'I would have tea with her and say 'I don't know how you do it, looking after nine kids with all those little ones,' she said. 

'And Raina would say 'you just do it. You love them so you do it. There is not other option.'

'How did this happen? How didn't I see the signs? Why didn't she ask for help? She had so many friends. She has such a big family. The help was there.'

Family members mourn at the scene of a memorial which is located in the park next to the home of the multiple stabbing

A family member fell to the ground as he visited the makeshift shrine to the eight children who were brutally murdered in the house

A floral tribute has been set up in the park across the street from the children's house 

Sitting at the base of the willow tree where an incredible display of flowers, teddy bears, paintings and heartfelt tributes have been left, Jade said she couldn't bring herself to be angry with the mother of nine.

Less than 15 metres away, there are constant flashes as criminal/forensic investigators photograph the evidence in the room where the children were brutally murdered.

'They keep dying, I can't do it,' she says while trying to light candles for the children.

'It's just stupid meaningless candles but I have to do something. I can't stop thinking about it, I don't know what to do.'

Jade said she could not bring herself to be angry at the mother. Instead, she is troubled and worried that she hadn't noticed a problem with Raina.

'She never complained. Never complained about anything. She took such good care of those kids.

'There were parties but no more than other people here.

'The kids were always sleeping at friends and neighbours and family's houses - why couldn't she ask them for help instead of this? How could she do this? 

A police forensic officer can be seen entering the house in which eight children were stabbed to death in the Cairns suburb of Manoora 

This is the house in Manoora where the eight children, ranging from 18-months-old to 14-years-old were stabbed to death

The whole community of Manoora have been shocked by the multiple stabbings. Many mourners have a laid flowers, toys and even food at a floral tribute set up in the park across of the road from the children's house.  

Neighbours revealed the erratic behaviour of Mersane Warria hours before they were found dead in their house by their 20-year-old brother Lewis Warria.

Ms Warria, 37 was seen by neighbours running through the street screaming at 3am on the morning the bodies were found.

She approached a group of children and 'had a go at them', according to one community member.

After her confrontation with the youngsters she wandered back towards her home.

Only hours before her outburst, neighbours recalled seeing Ms Warria clearing out her home with her children. 

The mother was heard telling neighbours that she wanted a 'fresh start'.
