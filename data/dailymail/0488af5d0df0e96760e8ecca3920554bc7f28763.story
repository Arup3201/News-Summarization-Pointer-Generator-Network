Being left stranded by a beach ball at the Stadium of Light in 2009 is not one of Pepe Reina's favourite moments from his career in the Premier League, but at least he was able to laugh it off.

Reina was infamously beaten by a Darren Bent shot that deflected off a beach ball that gave Sunderland a 1-0 win over Liverpool, and a question about that match came up on a quiz show recently.

On ITV's The Chase, one contestant was asked which object Bent's shot deflected off during that game on it's way into the net.

Given that the other two options in the multiple choice were an ice cream van and a sunbathing German, a beach ball should have been the obvious answer.

Instead, though, the contestant answered with an ice cream van only to be told it was the wrong answer.

Reina was able to laugh off the answer on Twitter, even if it is one of the most embarrassing moments in his career.
