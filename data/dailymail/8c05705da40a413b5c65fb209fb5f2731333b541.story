Jonny Wilkinson is an extremely calm, reserved and quiet individual - although not in the changing room it appears!

The ex-England fly half, who dropped the winning goal in the 2003 World Cup final, claimed both the Heineken Cup and the Top 14 titles with Toulon last season before retiring.

And, in a promotional video ahead of the release of a DVD showcasing the French side's magnificent double-winning season, Wilkinson is seen giving a passionate - and expletive-laden - team talk during half-time of the Top 14 semi-final against Racing Metro at Stade Pierre-Mauroy.

Flicking seamlessly between English and French, Toulon captain Wilkinson insists: 'We're leading by a point with 40 minutes to play in a semi-final.

'F****** get it straight, OK. Set it in. Get it in your f****** heads what's happening.

'We f****** get in line and we go up - like Toulon do, OK?

'We're f****** here and there's 40 minutes to go. Change it - change it yourselves. We've got enough experience in here.'

Wilkinson delivered an expletive-laden speech in which he demanded more from his fellow Toulon stars

The team then came together for a hug and a chant before going out for the second half of the semi-final

Wilkinson, who scored 1,179 points for England between 1998 and 2011 - as well as 67 in six Tests for the British and Irish Lions - retired after leading Toulon to the double in 2013-14.

He also won the Heineken Cup with Toulon in 2012-13, as well as the Premiership (1997-98) and two Powergen Cups (2001 and 2004) with Newcastle Falcons.

The 35-year-old made his TV debut for international matches on Sky Sports during England's 24-21 loss to New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday.

The advert describes Toulon's 2013-14 campaign as 'Une saison historique' - 'an historic season' - and is previewing their DVD review of last season entitled 'En Route Vers Le Double' ('On The Road To The Double').
