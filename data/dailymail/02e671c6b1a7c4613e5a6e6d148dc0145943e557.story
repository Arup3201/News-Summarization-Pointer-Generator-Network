Gay marriages are a 'Trojan horse' that 'fundamentally weakens' the institution of the family, a senior Roman Catholic cardinal has warned.

The Catholic Church has been at war over the acceptance of same sex unions following an unprecedented Vatican sex conference last month.

A global group of bishops tasked with bringing church teachings into line with the modern world rejected proposals for wider acceptance of gay relationships, which had Pope Francis' backing.

Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, the head of the Italian Bishops Conference, has said that same sex unions 'undermine' traditional family life, and said it was 'irresponsible to weaken the family by creating new forms'.

Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, the head of the Italian Bishops Conference, yesterday said that civil unions between gay men and women 'confuse people' and 'undermine' traditional family life, particularly if the couples have children.

He told a conference of Italian bishops in Assisi: 'It is irresponsible to weaken the family by creating new forms.

'It only confuses people and has the effect of being a sort of Trojan horse, undermining culturally and socially the core of humanity.'

Children 'have a right to a mother and a father', the Cardinal said.

He added: 'The family continues to be the stronghold of our country: the charitable, moral and material net that protects people from feeling abandoned and alone.'

The cardinal said children had a right to a 'mother and a father' and that the family was a 'stronghold of our country'; above, same-sex couple Ariel Owens, right, and his spouse Joseph Barham after their civil union 

Cardinal Bagnasco's remarks follow a war over gay marriage in Italy after the government ordered the annulment of same sex marriages conducted abroad.

Gay marriage is not legal in staunchly Catholic Italy, but a number of mayors have defied ministerial orders to recognise the unions.

Politicians were divided over the issue. The ruling centre left party is attempting to push through legislation to legalise gay civil unions.

But Eugenia Roccella, an MP with the New Centre Right party said: 'Cardinal Bagnasco's comments on the family are, as ever, absolutely clear.

'The attempt by mayors to undermine the law and the Italian constitution by registering gay marriages performed abroad is specious and constitutes a classic Trojan horse tactic.'
