They say it's the season of goodwill to all men. And Christmas has definitely come early for one charity shop.

A British Heart Foundation store in London is celebrating after 30 designer wedding dresses were generously donated from an anonymous high-end fashion boutique.

The brand new gowns, which would usually sell for up to £6,000, are to go on sale at the shop in Swiss Cottage with a price tag of between £200-£500.

Charity chic: The wedding gowns will be sold at an affordable £200-£500 each at the British Heart Foundation store in Swiss Cottage, London

High end: The dresses include designers such as Oscar de la Renta, Peter Langner, Carlos Miele and Monique Lhuillier 

Generous donation: The dresses, two of which are modelled in front of the Swiss Cottage store, are from a range of designers

The dresses are from a range of designers, including Oscar de la Renta, Peter Langner, Carlos Miele and Monique Lhuillier.

And staff at the shop are expecting the dresses to be so in demand, they will be stored out the back - to be tried on by request only. 

The boutique, which did not want to be named, donated the dresses, which would have been worth between £4,000-£6,000 when bought brand new, after having a clear out.

All profits made from the sale of the gowns will go towards the charity's research.

Bargain buys: The designer dresses will help 30 lucky brides shave hundreds off their wedding costs

High demand expected: Two of the 30 dresses that have been donated to the BHF shop in London

Last year, British Heart Foundation stores raised more than £31m to help the BHF fight heart disease, the nation's single biggest killer.

Richard Fletcher, BHF Area Manager, said: 'We're really thrilled with this generous donation of designer dresses. 

'It's fantastic that we're able to offer our customers good quality items at such great value. Hopefully we'll be able to help some brides-to-be have an extra special wedding day.

'It just goes to show the great types of items that can be found in our shops – it's like Aladdin's cave!  

'We'd urge anyone who has things lying around their house which they no longer want to call our free collection service or pop in and donate them to us.'

Following in her footsteps: Victoria Beckham donated 600 of her most memorable designer items to charity, making giving away high-end clothing to for a good cause popular across the UK (Pictured: three of the outfits that went on sale) 

Role model: In February, the fashion icon paid a visit to South Africa, where she met with mothers2mothers (m2m) founder Dr Mitch Besser and his mentor mothers who provide support and education about HIV

Many charities including the BHF have benefited from increasing numbers both donating to and shopping at charity shops across the UK.

People are often inspired by celebrities they look up to supporting charities by donating unwanted items.

In August, Victoria Beckham gave fans the chance to snap up a piece of her coveted wardrobe, selling more than 600 items for charity.

In February, following an invitation from Vogue editor Anna Wintour and American Vogue to visit South Africa, Victoria met with mothers2mothers (m2m) founder Dr Mitch Besser.

His charity trains, employs and empowers 'mentor mothers', who are mothers living with HIV, in order to educate them on how to prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers to babies and improve the health of women and their families.

Victoria was so moved by the experience that she wanted to do all she could to raise money and awareness.
