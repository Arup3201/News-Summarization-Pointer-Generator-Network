A car crash on Thursday afternoon in Ohio killed three teenagers and injured two others.

The teenagers crashed shortly after 12:30pm when their Mitsubishi went off the road, flipped and hit a tree, Sgt. Russell Pasqualetti told the Newark Advocate.

Photos from the scene show the car in two pieces.

The Ohio Highway Patrol says Cheyenne Spurgeon, 15, Linzie Bell, 15, and Michael Hoskinson, 17, were dead at the scene.

'Just from looking at it, from the length of the skid marks and the damage to the vehicle, they were certainly going over the speed limit on this road,' Pasqualetti said. 'Certainly traveling in excess of any safe speed on this road.'

Driver Jaylynn Rigio, 16, is at Children's Hospital in Columbus. His condition has not been released. Passenger Ashton Cody, 16, was reportedly hospitalized, according to local media.

Three people were ejected from the car during the crash, according to ABC6OnYourSide. None of the teens wore seat belts.

Counselors and clergy were available on Thursday for students and staff with the Johnstown-Monroe Local School District, superintendent Dale Dickson said in a statement.

'The Johnstown-Monroe Local School District is saddened to learn of the tragic accident involving our students,' he said. 'Our children are among the most precious gifts we receive in life. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of these precious ones.'

A candlelight vigil was also held on Thursday evening for the victims.
