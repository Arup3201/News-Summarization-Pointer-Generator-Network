England's itinerary for their seven-match one-day international tour of Sri Lanka this winter has been confirmed.

The England and Wales Cricket Board has announced that the national side will play four games in Colombo, two in Pallekelle and one in Hambantota during the series in November and December.

The first match will take place at the R Premadasa International Stadium on November 26 and conclude at the same venue on December 16.

Defeat: Cook trudges off at Edgbaston in the recent ODI series which England lost 3-2 to Sri Lanka

Four of the matches will be day/night affairs and five of them have been designated reserve days in the event of bad weather.

It has also been announced England will play two warm-up games, elsewhere in Colombo, on November 21 and 23.

There had been suggestions the sides would play five ODIs and two Twenty20 internationals but they have decided to concentrate on 50-over cricket ahead of the 2015 World Cup.

The two teams have just met in a five-match series in England, with Sri Lanka winning 3-2.
