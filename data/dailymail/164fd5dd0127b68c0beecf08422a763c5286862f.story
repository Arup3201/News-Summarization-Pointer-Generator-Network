An investigation has been launched into an incident where one student was pinned down by one of his classmates while a third rubbed his genitals around the first boy's face.

The incident unfolded on The Scots College's Glengarry campus in Kangaroo Valley - almost 160 kilometres south of Sydney in New South Wales - last month,The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

NSW Police have confirmed to Daily Mail Australia they were looking into the matter.

The Scots College's Glengarry Campus in the Kangaroo Valley south of Sydney was the scene of the alleged incident 

'Detectives from the NSW Police Force are making inquiries into an incident which is alleged to have occurred at an educational campus in Kangaroo Valley,' a spokesman said.

'For investigative reasons, no other information can be provided at this time.'

While the college's principal Ian Lambert did not reveal specifics, he said there had been incident and the parents of the students at the centre of it had been alerted.

'The College immediately implemented our procedures, which included reporting to the NSW Police and speaking with the parents of the boys involved in the incident,' Dr Lambert told Fairfax Media.

'Other agencies were informed and kept updated during the investigation.'

It is understood by Fairfax Media the two boys who initiated the incident were still enrolled at the school.

They have since come back to the Bellevue Hill campus in Sydney's east.

A parent at the school said bullying was 'particularly rife' at the Kangaroo Valley campus, saying it was 'accepted as an "old boys" rite of passage'. 

But this is not the first controversy involving The Scots College.

The school was ordered to pay almost $500,000 to Nathan Chaina's family last year. Nathan drowned on a school excursion at Glengarry in 1999.

It took 12 years for his family to finally get the Supreme Court to rule in their favour, but the Chainas were later told they had to pay for the school's $8 million legal bill.

The Scots College made headlines last year when the family of Nathan Chaina, who drowned while on a school trip at its Glengarry campus, were paid compensation over his death

The two residential terms at Glengarry by Year 9 students are meant to be 'a rite of passage into manhood' where 'boys learn the tools they need to grow into fine young men', according The Scots College website. 

The news of last month's incident comes as Boarding Australia and the Australian Boarding Schools Association - which represent institutions - look to review protocol following revelations during the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse involving Knox Grammar School.

It has been revealed headmasters at the helm of Knox over the years have kept silent over sexual abuse cases, which were happening under their watch.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted The Scots College for a response.
