For their wedding last week, terminally ill bride Liza Heaton and her newlywed husband, Wyatt, were given the the best gift of all -- a kernel of hope.

Heaton, 25, from Louisiana, had been in remission from synovila sarcoma for three years, but last Thursday she received the devastating news that she has just one month to live.

Her rare form of cancer had returned with a vengeance and cannot be treated using traditional methods.

Power of a love: A day after terminally ill Liza married her boyfriend, Wyatt Heaton, in a surprise ceremony, she learned that the obstruction that prevented her treatment cleared

Facing the devastating prospect of losing his girlfriend in the very near future, Wyatt Heaton threw a surprise wedding for the cancer-stricken woman. 

But the best part came after the bittersweet event. 

The following day, the Heatons learned that the obstruction that was preventing Liza's treatment cleared, allowing the newlywed to take a chemotherapy pill.

If all goes according to plan, the treatment will stop the growth of Heaton's tumors, and possibly even shrink them.

Michelle Haynie, Heaton's mother, told 11Alive the hope is her daughter will be able to join a drug trial in the spring to treat the cancer.

Since receiving the good news, Heaton has left hospice care and her treatment is no longer considered palliative.

‘Last week we were thinking hospice. Only a few weeks left. Then with this chemo pill we weren't given a time frame. We're hopeful to beat it again and go into remission and spend the rest of our lives together,’ Liza told the station.

The family have been inspired to launch a GoFundMe campaign to raise money towards cancer research.

Since the page went live a week ago, more than 2,800 people have donated a whopping $352,000, and counting.

Heaton said she was overwhelmed by the response from her family, friends, and even celebrities.

'Someone got Lance Armstrong to call me last night,' Heaton gushed.

Last week, it seemed to Liza that her dreams of marrying her boyfriend Wyatt would never materialize.

Wyatt had other ideas.

Calling on more than 100 relatives and friends from across the United States to flock to Shreveport, Louisiana, he planned a wedding in just two days.

On Saturday December 13 (12.13.14), they exchanged vows by the riverside at dusk and promised each other they would continue fighting the disease to the end.

'When they said it would not be months, but weeks, I took that to mean a wedding was off the table,' Liza told Shreveport Times.

'Wyatt took it to mean, OK, we have to get married this weekend.'

Devastated: Liza had been in remission for three years with no medical issues until Thanksgiving Day

Next stage: She went into hospital with abdominal pains and found the cancer had returned aggressively

Options: Liza (pictured right, next to her sister Ann Marie) plans to join a clinical trial to find treatment

At the wedding, Liza announced she plans to enter a clinical trial at John Hopkins University in a desperate bid to find treatment.

Her sister has also set up a Love for Liza page on GoFundMe to raise funds for other medication they plan to pursue. 

She had been investigating options since doctors first rediscovered the cancer on Thanksgiving Day, when she went to hospital with stomach pains.

It was the first sign of any medical problems since Liza was given the all-clear in 2011.

Tragically, a scan showed the cancer - which commonly targets young adults - had spread to her bowels, making surgery impossible.

Staying strong: Wyatt and Liza are looking to raise money so they can fight the disease to the end

'For three years there wasn't really any bad news,' Liza told Today. 'I thought we had beat it.

'When it came back this time, it was such a whirlwind. You're not really ever ready for that news.'

Her first instinct was to tell every friend and relative.

'I guess I would want everyone to know that people who have cancer... you're still living.

'I definitely feel like I'm living with cancer, not dying with cancer.'
