Denial: Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans continues to refute all allegations made against him

Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans continued to protest his innocence yesterday after being arrested on new claims of indecently assaulting young men.

Mr Evans, 55, was interviewed by detectives about the latest  allegations, involving three men in their 20s, after answering bail over earlier claims of rape and sexual assault.

Afterwards he said he continued to ‘refute’ all the accusations and hoped for swift ‘closure’ over the claims.

The Conservative MP for Ribble Valley in Lancashire was first arrested on May 4 at his constituency home in the village of Pendleton.

He was held for 15 hours over claims he raped one man and indecently assaulted another, both in their 20s, in the village between 2009 and this year.

After being released on bail on that occasion, Mr Evans said he had just endured ‘the worst 24 hours of my life’.

He branded the allegations ‘completely false’, saying they had been made by people he had ‘regarded as friends’.

Subsequently, a third man gave a statement to police alleging Mr Evans had sexually assaulted him.

Also last month a former Parliamentary intern reportedly told detectives the MP groped his bottom in a Commons bar in 2011.

The 22-year-old, who had never met Mr Evans, said he had been showing his parents around Parliament at the time.

Mr Evans was rearrested after answering bail at Preston police station yesterday morning.

The new allegations cover three counts of indecent assault on men in their 20s in Blackpool and London between 2003 and 2011.

After spending almost five hours 
inside the police station being questioned, a smiling Mr Evans emerged 
with his solicitor, Daniel Berk, and again pledged to clear his name.

‘Clearly, we want closure of this as 
quickly as possible and we carry on assisting this inquiry fully and 
openly,’ Mr Evans said.

‘I continue to refute all allegations 
and in the meantime can I say that I am extremely grateful to the huge 
amount of support and love I’ve received from my family, my friends, my 
constituents and indeed people throughout the country who have contacted
me.’

He declined to answer any questions 
before climbing into a white Volkswagen Polo and being driven away by 
his House of Commons researcher.

Lancashire Police said he had been 
released on bail until September.

Mr Evans publicly revealed he was gay 
in an article in The Mail on Sunday in 2010, saying he was ‘tired of 
living a lie’ and had, in the past, received threats of blackmail from 
political enemies threatening to expose him.

Asked yesterday whether David Cameron 
believed Mr Evans should step down as one of the Commons’ three deputy 
speakers while the allegations are investigated, the Prime Minister’s 
official spokesman said: ‘That is a matter for the House authorities.’

A Lancashire Police spokesman said: ‘A
55-year-old man from Pendleton has today answered his bail following 
his arrest in May on suspicion of rape and sexual assault.

‘He has subsequently been further arrested on suspicion of three further offences of indecent assault.’

'Incredulity': Mr Evans said he could not understand why the 'completely false' accusations had been made
