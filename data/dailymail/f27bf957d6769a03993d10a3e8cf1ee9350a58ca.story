When number seven for Steven Gerrard's side walked onto the hallowed Anfield turf once again, a roar was heard from all sides of the stadium, as fans welcomed the return of the brilliant, exciting and unpredictable maverick that is Luis Suarez.

The Liverpool fan favourite got tongues wagging after refusing to rule out a return in the future, while disappointing the likes of Manchester City after revealing that he would only ever play for the Merseyside club. 

Speaking to Liverpool TV he said: 'You never know in football what the future holds but if I ever play in England again, I will play for the Liverpool team and not another team.

It was no surprise to see Suarez receive such a welcoming from the Reds faithful after a unforgettable three-and-a-half-year spell with the club.

And while he is forging his own reputation in Barcelona now, he still fondly remembers his spell in England.

'I've missed the fans,' added Suarez, who scored the winner in El Clasico against Real Madrid seven days ago.

'The atmosphere is unbelievable, it's amazing. Everyone who's played for Liverpool knows how important the supporters are. They know they are in my heart.'

Suarez was also delighted to back alongside his friend and former team-mate Steven Gerrard and holds the midfielder in the highest regard.

Suarez was quick to praise the Liverpool captain and tweeted a picture of the duo captioned: 'Unbelievable to be back at Anfield and surrounded by great players... Here a picture with the greatest one!!'

Despite his goal scoring troubles on the pitch for Liverpool, Mario Balotelli was in top form, firing home a thumping effort and setting up Thierry Henry for the second.

The Italian striker was sure to not let the Arsenal legend forget it when posting a picture of the duo and Didier Drogba on his Instagram. 

He said: 'LEGENDS...Always nice to see you guys. @didierdrogba you are welcome for my pass.'
