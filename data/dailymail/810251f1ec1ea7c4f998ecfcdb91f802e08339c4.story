Doh! Jailin Turner was jailed after she asked police for help when she was locked out of her home and they found pot plants and bongs after helping her inside

An Iowa woman who was locked out of her apartment was soon locked up in jail after officers who helped her regain entry found pot plants and bongs in plain view, police said Friday.

Iowa City police say Jailin Turner is charged with possession of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, failure to affix drug tax stamp and disorderly house.

To her credit, it wasn't 19-year-old Turner who called police. They say they arrived to her home just after midnight following a call about a woman banging on a window.

That woman, police say, turned out to be Turner. She was on a balcony yelling and kicking a window when they showed up.

The Iowa City Press-Citizen reports she told them she'd lost her keys. 

At some point, police claim Turner tossed a plastic deck table off the balcony in their direction. 

Nonetheless, after an unsuccessful late night call to the building's management, police had a fire crew break into her apartment.

There, out in the open, were two bongs police say.

Turner then gave police consent to search her home. They found potted plants under grow lights, thy say.

Jail records showed she was in custody on Monday. It's unclear whether she has an attorney. 

Officials also said they found a scale and marijuana grinders.

What was she thinking? Police say Turner had two bongs in plain view. She consented to further search, at which time they found two marijuana plants and grow lights as well as other paraphernalia

Turner hadn't called them--they were called on her--but seeing an opportunity, she took it
