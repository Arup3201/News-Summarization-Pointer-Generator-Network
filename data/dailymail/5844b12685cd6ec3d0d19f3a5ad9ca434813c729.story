History: Martin Odegaard came Norway's youngest player ever, aged 15 years and 253 days

Impressive:  Teenager Oedegaard came close to breaking the deadlock in the first half

Odegaard took the field in Stavanger to break a record that had stood for over a century and almost marked his debut with a goal in a game that finished 0-0.

Tormod Kjellsen was Norway's previous youngest debutant. He was aged 15 years and 351 days when he played against Sweden in 1910.

'It's incredibly huge to realise the dream that I've had since I was very, very small,' Odegaard told broadcaster MAX. 'I didn't think I'd start at all, so to play 90 minutes is good.'

Norway coach Per-Mathias Hogmo was pleased with the teenager, who has thrilled Norwegian soccer fans since bursting onto the domestic scene.

'I think he came out of it well, and he was very close to deciding the game,' Hogmo told MAX. 'He showed the kind of qualities he has.'

Odegaard has already represented Norway's Under 17 side, including appearances against the United States, France and Scotland.
