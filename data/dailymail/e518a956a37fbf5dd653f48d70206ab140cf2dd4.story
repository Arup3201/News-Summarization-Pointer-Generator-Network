Yvonne Preston, 49, has been banned indefinitely after becoming infatuated with one of her pupils

A teacher who declared her love for a pupil with cards quoting One Direction lyrics has been barred from schools indefinitely.

Yvonne Preston, 49, a former English teacher at Castle Hall Academy in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, became infatuated with the teenager and showered him with gifts, a teaching tribunal heard.

A National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) panel was told the married mother asked the boy to dance with her in front of his class at the end of year prom.

The panel also heard how Mrs Preston begged the pupil to see her again after he left school.

In a greetings card sent to the boy, she wrote: 'I have loved having you in my life; I’ve loved spoiling you.

'The thought of not seeing you, talking to you and just being with you breaks my heart - so I’m asking don’t go. Don’t leave. Please stay with me!'

In a Christmas card she said: 'You mean far too much to me than you should - but I wouldn’t have it any other way.'

And in another card she quoted lyrics from One Direction's debut number one single 'What Makes You Beautiful'.

She wrote: 'You light up my world like nobody else.'

The panel heard that Mrs Preston had bought the pupil, whose exact age has not been disclosed, a mug and calendar, both including her home address, as well as a DVD box set and a concert ticket.

Mrs Preston had also downloaded photos of the teenager onto her work laptop and had called him into a storeroom to discuss a comment he had posted on Twitter.

The panel heard Mrs Preston, who worked at the school from December 2011 and May 2013, sent inappropriate text messages to another pupil regarding the boy.

She was barred from teaching at schools, colleges and children’s homes indefinitely.

Mrs Preston will have to wait at least two years before she can re-apply to the NCTL - a government body which regulates teachers’ conduct - to have her ban lifted.

A teaching panel agreed there was evidence that Mrs Preston was suffering from mental health problems at the time

Members of the panel accepted there was ‘some evidence’ that Mrs Preston was suffering from mental health problems at the time and she had shown ‘genuine remorse’.

However the panel along with the NCTL deputy director Alan Meyrick concluded that her behaviour had fallen short and could bring the profession into disrepute.

Mr Meyrick said: 'This conduct fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession and amounts to unacceptable professional conduct.

'In addition the panel also found that Mrs Preston’s actions constitute conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute.'

The panel decided that while Mrs Preston’s behaviour had not amounted to ‘serious sexual  misconduct’ there had been an ‘abuse of position’.

Mrs Preston resigned in June 2013 after disciplinary proceedings were started by the school.

Mr Andy Pugh, principal at Castle Hall, said the matter was dealt with by the school more than a year ago.

He said the school had taken decisive action as soon as matters were brought to its attention.
