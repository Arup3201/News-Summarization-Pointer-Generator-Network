After her painfully public break-up, Cheryl Cole could be more than forgiven for turning her back on marriage for good.

Instead, the singer, who is divorced from footballer Ashley Cole, says she still believes in the sanctity of the institution, calling it a ‘bond for life’.

The 28-year-old spoke out as she revealed she is backing same-sex marriage, which the Government is currently drawing up plans to legalise – despite strong criticism from the Church of England.

Her marriage to the Chelsea player ended in 2010, following allegations he had cheated on her with five women.

In a radio interview, she said: ‘Marriage is far more than a man and a woman, you know. It’s a bond for life and whether you’re gay or straight or whatever, it makes no difference to being married. What marriage stands for is that you love that person.

‘You want to commit yourself to that person forever. All the rights that a marriage gives you, why should the fact that you are attracted to the same sex make that any different? It makes no sense to me. The same relationship, the same beliefs ... It’s crazy. I don’t understand why it’s even a big deal!’

The singer married Cole in 2006, but they split three years later and their divorce was finalised in 2010.

She made her comments in an interview to promote her new album, A Million Lights, on Gaydar Radio.

As well as sharing her manifesto on marriage, she told listeners she believed her pet chihuahua, Buster, is gay. 

‘I think so … he likes male company – he’s just not interested in the females,’ she said.
