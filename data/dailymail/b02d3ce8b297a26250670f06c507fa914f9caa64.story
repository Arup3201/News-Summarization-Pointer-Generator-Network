A professional cage fighter has been jailed for 19 years for repeatedly stabbing his pregnant ex-girlfriend - in an attempt to kill her unborn child.

Nicholas Leaning, 28, stabbed Lauren Oliver five times in the stomach when she was seven months pregnant in a bid to conceal that he was  the father.

A jury took just 90 minutes to find Leaning guilty of attempted child destruction and wounding with intent, and was today jailed at Hull Crown Court with a judge describing him as a 'ticking time bomb'.

Leaning, from Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, was cleared by the same jury of attempted murder.

Members of his family shouted 'I love you', 'I will sort this son,' and 'no matter what happens we love you baby', as he was taken from the dock to begin his prison term.

During a week-long trial, the court heard how the cage fighter carried out the brutal attack on his ex-girlfriend of two-years after she discovered he had resumed a relationship with a former partner.

Simon Waley, prosecuting, said: 'He had been seeing both of these women for some time and they discovered this among themselves.

'Lauren had become pregnant. When the defendant learned of the pregnancy he had tried to  persuade her to have an abortion and when she said she didn't want to, he became angry and said he didn't want to have anything to do with the child.

'He began to indicate to others that the child wasn't his and he hadn't been sleeping with Lauren for some time.

'Lauren and Lindsay had been in touch with each other and had been on friendly terms and arranged a DNA test to determine who was the father.

'He said he would not participate in such a test so Lindsay said she would allow DNA from their child to be used.'

The jury heard how Leaning attacked Miss Oliver at her home in Belton, Lincolnshire, as she returned from dropping her daughter at school on the morning of June 11.

As she opened her front door, he plunged a knife into her stomach and pushed her on to the floor where he made four further stab wounds - threatening the life of her unborn baby.

The jury was played evidence from Miss Oliver, who described what happened and said she knew 'what he was going for'.

She said: 'I knew it was him and I knew what he was going for. He was trying to kill the baby.

'It was like he was enjoying it because he was smiling. I pleaded with him not to kill me and my baby.

'He stabbed me five times. I felt a massive gush of blood between my legs and I thought my baby was dead.'

Miss Oliver said Leaning wore a cage fighting mask during the attack, which he wore for training, as well as a dark hoodie, blue jeans and a black and red baseball cap.

She said: 'All I could see was his eyes staring at me.

'The first stab took me down. I bent forward and then he pushed me and he was standing over the top of me.

'He was trying to get the knife in as many times as he could. I was shouting "someone help me please", and "Nick please stop it".

'Eventually he got up and ran away. It's just sick.'

Following the stabbing, Leaning fled from the scene and Miss Oliver was taken to hospital where her baby girl was born by emergency caesarean, just hours later.

The court heard that the baby, now seven months old, is healthy despite the attack.

In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mr Waley said the attack had 'changed everything about her life'.

He said: 'She's scared when she's at home. It's affected her ability to eat and sleep, she's attended counselling on a regular basis and suffers from anxiety.'

Mr Waley also said Miss Oliver is now too afraid to go out alone and cannot feel able to allow her older daughter to play outside for fear of having the doors unlocked.

The court was told that Miss Oliver still has visible scars from the stab wounds, which can be 'uncomfortable and unpleasant'.

During the trial, the jury heard how Leaning and Miss Oliver had been in a 'great' relationship for around two years before she discovered he had rekindled a relationship with his ex-partner Lindsay Coombs.

The pair split in November last year - but Miss Oliver then discovered she was pregnant with his child.

She claims he made repeated instructions to her to abort the baby, but she refused.

She said: 'I went to see Lindsay and she showed me pictures and messages and everything to prove they were together.

'We found out he had been with us both all along.

'I found out I was pregnant, and when I told him he told me to I had to go and get an abortion, but I didn't want to.

'He was nice at first saying "it's not right", but when I said I couldn't go through with it, he got mad.

'He said he would kick it out of me if he had to. He said I had to get rid of it but when I wouldn't, he said he didn't want anything to do with it.'

It was then that Leaning's former partner Lindsay demanded a DNA test to confirm the paternity of the baby - something he refused to co-operate with.

'She wanted a DNA test and I said they could have one,' said Miss Oliver.

'He was trying to tell everyone it wasn't his and he wasn't happy that the DNA test was going to be done because he knew it would prove it was his baby.

'Lindsay was messaging me and said I could use their daughter to do the test. She wanted to know if the baby was his.'

The court heard that Leaning was arrested around an hour after the incident at his home address in Scunthorpe.

Mr Waley said that he gave a number of conflicting accounts as to his whereabouts on the morning.

During police questioning, Leaning finally admitted being at Lauren's property where he said she had shouted at him and 'came at him with a knife'.

Mr Waley added: 'It's absurd that a 34-week pregnant Lauren launched an attack on her cage fighter ex-boyfriend and then went on to stab herself and her unborn baby five times in an act of spite against the defendant.'

Judge Jeremy Richardson QC described Leaning as a 'ticking timebomb' and said: 'Something had to be done and it was.'

Jailing him, Judge Richardson added: 'This is an exceptionally serious case of its kind. It calls for an exceptional sentence to reflect the malignancy of your violent behaviour where you brutally stabbed a pregnant woman five times in order to kill her unborn child.

'I repeat - you intended to kill that child and it is only good fortune that prevented the execution of that truly wicked objective.

'It is good fortune alone that has resulted in the child suffering no long term effects of that trauma. The same cannot be said for the mother. She is scared both physically and mentally by what you did.

'You have been found guilty by a jury upon clear evidence. That jury has seen through the entirely bogus account you presented in your trial. 

'You intended really serious injury upon Lauren Oliver and you concurrently intended, by seriously wounding her, that the life of the baby, which was at seven months gestation in her womb, would be extinguished.

'You have not shown a shred of remorse for what you did. Indeed, you have made outrageous assertions that Lauren Oliver stabbed herself and attempted to kill her own baby as an act of revenge for you choosing your former partner over her.

'Let there be no mistake that this is a very serious example of a crime of this kind. This is not simply a case of a brutal and sustained attack upon a vulnerable woman who happened to be pregnant, but a vicious attack with a knife upon a pregnant woman intending to kill the unborn baby.

'You wanted to kill that unborn infant and you set about that task with calculated determination. It was a vile act.'

Following the sentencing, Detective Inspector Alan Curtis from Humberside Police, said: 'Nineteen years is a long time for Nicholas Leaning to think about what he's done in prison and it reflects the grotesque nature of the attack and the fact that Lauren Oliver really was vital to his ultimate aim which was to kill the unborn baby.

'You don't come across pregnant ladies that are stabbed in broad daylight, on their doorsteps. It was pre-meditated, it was calculated, it was planned and it was a despicable act. It was only a pure miracle that they survived.

'They will still carry mental and physical scars for the rest of their lives but it could have been far worse.'
