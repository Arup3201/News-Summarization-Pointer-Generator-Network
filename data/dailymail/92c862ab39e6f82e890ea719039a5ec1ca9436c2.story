Retail guru Mary Portas has been branded as a 'Queen of Flops' by critics who say her plans to help struggling high streets are nothing more than 'gimmicks' that have failed.

Traders in the seaside resort of Margate in Kent, which won a £100,000 government grant, claim the town's high street is now in a worse state than when she arrived to help, as the Government-appointed 'retail tzar', six months ago. 

Her plans for the town have included displaying art in abandoned shop fronts.

But supporters say Portas has done much to help promote the coastal town, as a bitter war of words casts a cloud over the Queen of Shop's efforts.

The row erupted as new figures reveal little of the £1.1million set aside by the Government to reinvigorate high streets across Britain has actually been spent - with Margate using just over £100 of its £100,000 pot.

The high street campaigner came under recent fire after it was revealed Dartford Council spent more than £1,000 of its grant money hiring a person in a Peppa Pig costume, as well as nearly £6,000 on newspaper surveys.

Just 'gimmicks'? Critics claims retail guru Mary Portas has failed to help their high streets

Ghost town: Margate's high street now has a 36.1% vacancy rate

Last May, Margate was one of 12 towns to win a Government grant to help breathe new life into its depressed high street.

It was hoped £100,000 would help reclaim the heyday of the mid-1800s, when throngs of Victorian visitors would flock to the seaside town.

Today Margate's high street is a much different picture and with a 35.1% vacancy rate, there are few shops left to attract potential customers.

So when the Government enlisted Mary Portas to help boost struggling high streets, retailers were no doubt thinking their shop tills would be ringing again in no time.

But figures published today in The Sunday Times, under a Freedom of Information Act request by retail expert Paul Turner-Mitchell, show just £111.47 of the £100,000 had been spent on Margate's retailers by December 2012, using a combination of stationery and Land registry searches.

The four people who led the original Town Team grant application have all resigned and claim Portas' plans had 'no substance' and she focused her energies on helping the old town and seafront, which have not been as badly effected in the economic downturn.

Robin Vaughan-Lyons, who led the bid last year, said: 'It has all been a huge waste of time. It is all gimmicks and no substance, there is nothing real that has been done, not for local people who want to shop in their local shops.'

On the beach: Portas has come under fire for focusing on Margate's Old Town, but the retail expert claims she was merely showing what the high street could become

Another trader, Terry Silk, who owns Yama's restaurant, also claims neither the money or the arrival of Portas have done much to change the situation.

But the council and the new Town Team say much is being done to help the high street, including plans for community dance studios and steak houses.

Richard Ash, who took as chairman of the new Town Team in October, said not spending the money means they still have it for spending on planned projects.

He added: 'She [Portas] hasn't done it 100% right, I agree, but she has tried to promote Margate and has brought a lot of publicity.'

High hopes: Prime Minister David Cameron appointed Mary Portas as his high street tsar in May 2011

Margate is not the only town clutching onto its grant. The figures reveal that overall just £161,773, or 14.5% of the £1.11m has been spent.

While Margate has only spent 0.1% of the money, both Bedford (4.6%) and Croydon (4.9%) have also spent under 5%. Bedminster spent the most, with 37.7% of the grant allocated to helping its high street.

Portas dismissed the claims as 'ridiculous', adding that she filmed Margate's old town as part of her programme series to show what the high street could become.

She added: 'There are people who comment, there are people who point and there are people who roll their sleeves up. In rolling my sleeves up, I come [in] for a knocking and I just have to take it but I can sleep at night.'
