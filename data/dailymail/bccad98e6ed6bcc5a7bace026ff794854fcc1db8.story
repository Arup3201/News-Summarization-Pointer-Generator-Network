Australian team medical staff will examine Shane Watson on Wednesday morning before he is allowed to continue his Boxing Day Test preparations.

Watson is being checked for signs of concussion after a James Pattinson bouncer hit him on the helmet during Tuesday net session.

The allrounder was left shaken by the impact and national selector Mark Waugh has revealed Watson felt off colour once he returned to the team hotel.

At this stage, it appears likely that Watson will stay in the team for the third Test against India.

'He was pretty much okay to start off with then he felt a little bit off colour back in his hotel room,' Waugh said while commentating for Channel 10 on Tuesday night's Big Bash League game.

'So I believe he's going to have a few tests overnight and well see how he comes up in the morning.

'Hopefully he should be okay to play in the Test match.'

Watson was left dazed after the bouncer hit him flush on the helmet.

He briefly fell to his knees from the impact, then immediately left the nets and was seen by the team doctor before leaving the MCG session.

The allrounder soon returned to the team hotel, rather than attend a fan family day outside the ground.

Pattinson looked upset after the incident and left training.

It is nearly a month since Phillip Hughes was felled by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match and died in hospital two days later.

Also at Tuesday training, paceman Mitchell Starc needed treatment after being hit on the knee while batting.

The blow left Starc limping noticeably.

But Starc is already unlikely to keep his place in the team for Boxing Day.

Veteran Ryan Harris bowled at full pace in Tuesday's session and return from injury at Starc's expense.

Opener David Warner was a notable absentee from the nets, watching on with his injured thumb strapped, but he is still expected to play.
