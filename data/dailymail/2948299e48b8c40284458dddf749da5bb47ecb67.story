A mother and father have appeared in court charged with murdering their son who died aged just seven weeks old.

Adam Kightley, 23, and Jackie Parker, 21, appeared at Northampton Magistrates Court this afternoon.

Prosecuting, Keith Lumb, said the 
charges related to the alleged murder of baby Jamie Kightley at a flat in the Far Cotton area of Northampton.

Seven-week-old Jamie Kightley died at Northampton General Hospital in March last year

Charged: Jamie Parker, 21, and Adam Kightley, 23, have been charged with murdering their baby son Jamie

He was taken to Northampton General Hospital but died on March 17 last year.

An inquest into his death was adjourned last April.

The pair, both from Northampton, spoke only to confirm their names and are due to appear at Northampton Crown Court tomorrow morning.

Kightley appeared dressed in a grey tracksuit, while Parker wore a light grey jumper.

They have been charged with murdering Jamie as well as neglect.

Members of the family were in court to support the pair and shouted ‘I love you’ as they were remanded in custody.

Magistrate Carol Taylor adjourned the case until today when they will appear at Northampton Crown Court.

Chairman of the bench, Carol Taylor, said: 'This matter has been sent to the crown court and will be heard tomorrow morning. Until then you are remanded into custody.'

The pair made no application for bail.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
