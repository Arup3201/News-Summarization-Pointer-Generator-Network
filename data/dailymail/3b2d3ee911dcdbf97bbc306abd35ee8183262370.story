From the outside it looks like your average semi-detached family home - quiet and unimposing

But house hunters viewing this property had a shock when they stepped inside - as it's been decorated entirely in purple.

Everything from the wallpaper, carpet, upholstery and furniture is violet and even the kitchen and bathroom didn't escape the purple theme.

Typical family home: This four bedroom property in Hillingdon, Middlesex, looks unimposing and traditional from the outside

But once inside... Home hunters got a bit of a shock when they discovered the current owner's colour theme

Fifty shades of purple: The white kitchen unit is offset by the purple walls and carpet

Dinner time: The dinning table chairs perfectly match the colour of the carpet and the curtains

Of the property's four bedrooms, each is predominately purple, with bed covers to match.

But the discreet exterior of the house would give no clue as to what awaits inside. The only purple insight are few lilac flowers planted in pots by the door.

Rightmove, which has advertised the bizarre house for £400,000 on its website, describes the pad as having 'a family-inspired design'.

Purple extravaganza: The advert for the unusual property has gone viral on the internet

Spotless: But while the decor may not be everyone's cup of tea, the estate agent handling the sale describes the property as being 'maintained to a high standard'

Quick sale: The four bedroom property is on the market for £400,000 - with a buyer already said to be lined up

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Rightmove's website doesn't mention the current owner's unique decor.

But once potential buyers scroll through the image gallery it becomes pretty clear.

It also says the home in Hillingdon, Middlesex, is 'maintained to a high standard' - and a potential buyer is apparently already lined up.

Who would live in a house like this? Not even the bathroom escaped the bold violet theme

Matching: Everything from the carpet, walls and window curtains are a shade of lilac

Sweet dreams: One of the four bedrooms in the property. The owners has even sourced purple wardrobes and chest of draws

Looks can deceive: The plain garden gives no clue of the more extravagant decor inside the property
