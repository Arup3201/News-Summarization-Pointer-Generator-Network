A California man died after a hole he was digging on the beach collapsed on top of him.

The victim was identified by by the San Mateo County Coroner's office as Adam Pye, 26, of San Lorenzo.

Pye dug a roughly 10-foot-deep hole at Francis State Beach and was standing in it around 5:30pm Monday when the sand started caving in around him, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Capt. Jonathan Cox told the Associated Press.

Victim: Adam Pye dug a roughly 10-foot-deep hole and was standing in it Monday when the sand started caving in around him

California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Capt. Jonathan Cox said about 30 people frantically dug with their hands, buckets and other improvised tools to expose his head

About 30 people, including Pye's friends and bystanders, frantically dug with their hands, buckets and other improvised tools to expose his head. They were able to free his head in about five minutes, just as firefighters arrived at the scene, Cox said.

'When they got there, they discovered he was unconscious,' Cox said.

Witness William Sylvia told NBCBayArea the diggers included 'people with just buckets, with just their hands, I mean whatever they can do - never seen a group of people work so hard.'

Sylvia said 40 diggers tried to rescue Pye.

Cox said paramedics managed to open Pye's airways while about 30 firefighters, aided by the bystanders, used shovels and other equipment to pull out his body.

Killed: Rescuers extricated Adam Pye from the sand in about 35 minutes and tried to revive him, but he died at the scene

Rescuers extricated him in about 35 minutes and tried to revive him, but he died at the scene, Cox said.

He dug the hole on a campground area of the beach, about 10 to 15 feet from the water line, Cox said.

'I know this will sound typical coming from his mom, but he really was the perfect child. He never had so much as a parking ticket,' mother Debbie Pye told SFGate.

Pye graduated from college this year and was going to start a new job, the website reported.

'He took care of everyone including us. He was always helping people, it was just his way,' his mother also said.
