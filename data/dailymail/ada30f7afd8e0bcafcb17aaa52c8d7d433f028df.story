Some airline passengers stuck waiting on the tarmac at the Seattle airport were treated to a soothing serenade courtesy of members of the city orchestra.

Alaska Airlines flight 550 passengers en route to Palm Springs, California on Sunday had made it as far as the runway when their plane was turned around and sent back to the gate due to technical issues.

While the irritable travelers waited, they were treated to some comforting musing from a string quartet that just happened to be on board with their instruments.

'We were lucky to be sitting amongst a string quartet who broke out their instruments and played for us,' said passenger Addie Bogart.

According to KING, Seattle Symphony violinsists Mikhail Shmidt and Elisa Barston, violist Susan Gulkis Assadi and cellist Walter Gray were behind the impromptu concert.

The quartet was en route to Palm Springs, where they were to play two benefit concerts.

'Made everyone's night!' Bogart said. 'It almost made us forget we were two hours late to Palm Springs.'

While many on the plane may not have known it, they were treated to a free concert from newly minted Grammy winners.

The Seattle Symphony won its very first Grammy award on Sunday for Best Contemporary Classical Composition for its recording of a commissioned piece by composer John Luther Adams.
