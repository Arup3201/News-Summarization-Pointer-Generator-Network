Room for improvement has been the saying for this international week but it is not a theme exclusive to England’s senior team.

Thanks to a late header from Harry Kane, Gareth Southgate’s unbeaten record as Under-21 head coach but if he is to lead England to Euro 2015, he will recognise a step up is required on this grinding 1-0 victory over Lithuania.

For long periods, England were frustrated by Lithuania’s stubborn defence and given they will be paired against superior opposition when the play-off draw is made next Friday, there are areas for Southgate to polish as he plots a path to the Czech Republic.

It must be recognised, though, that England continue to be able to find a way of winning these matches and Kane’s 81st minute effort means they have collected 25 points from a possible 27 in Group One with one final assignment in Moldova remaining.

‘We expected a difficult game and we knew they would defend deep,’ said Southgate. ‘But I was pleased that we were patient. We kept passing the ball and the beauty of having a strong squad means that we always have options. We thought we always had another gear.’

When these nations met in Ipswich last October, England ran riot with Ravel Morrison inspiring a 5-0 win but it was clear from an early stage they were not going to find this assignment as straightforward as the one at Portman Road.

If anything, the first 45 minutes were the most laboured this qualification campaign. When England arrived here on Thursday evening, the focus of training had been on short, sharp passing and slick movement but they failed to put that into practice.

Most surprisingly, England looked vulnerable in defence and they were lucky not to fall behind in the 14th minute when, after a sloppy clearance from Jack Butland, Lithuania were able to raid forward but Tomas Birskys failed to punish the error when firing over the bar.

England replied with a couple of half chances – Nathaniel Chalobah, who would later pick up a booking that rules him out of Tuesday’s game in Moldova, shot wide before James Ward-Prowse was off target – but they did not threaten to get Lithuania panicking.

By contrast, a melee at the other end should have saw Lithuania take the lead in the 39th minute but Chalobah hacked a shot from Lukas Baranauskas off the line; it wasn’t good enough and the way Southgate briskly walked back to the dressing room at the break confirmed as much.

Whatever Southgate said during the interval had some effect, as England started the second period much brighter. Saido Berahino forced the first meaningful save from Tomas Svedkauskas after a sharp move, one that was met with applause from Southgate.

Slowly but surely, England went through the gears as Nathan Redmond and Tom Ince started to have an influence. Redmond, in particular, was unlucky not to give England the lead when he hit the bar with a volley that skidded up off the turf.

It then became a question of whether Lithuania could hold out but their resistance was broken eventually when Kane rose highest to flick an inviting cross from Ward-Prowse’s beyond the grasp of Svedkauskas.

‘Harry is a goalscorer,’ said Southgate. ‘He is really knocking on the door now. We put him on at that stage of the game when they were tiring and he gave us different options. He is a penalty box player and it was a very good finish. I’m pleased we were able to get the job done.’
