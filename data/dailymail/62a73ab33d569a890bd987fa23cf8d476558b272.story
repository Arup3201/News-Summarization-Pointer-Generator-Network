This is the result when heat meets the freezing cold.

As Canada remains in the grip of bitter cold and record snowfall, one venue decided to make light of the situation.

The Takhini Hotel Pools in Whitehorse, Yukon, held their International Hair Freezing contest - and found some winners.

Milena Georgeault and her friends were this year's victors, thanks to an elaborate freezing of their hair at the hot springs.

So long as the temperature goes as low as -30C, the freezing of the hair can happen in under 60 seconds.

The competition runs every year in February, and all candidates have to do is enter the springs and freeze their hair.

To be in with a chance of winning a $150 prize, people have to post the photo of their frozen hair onto the venue's Facebook before the month is out.

By doing so you will also be helping publicise this unique niche of the springs - photos may be used for advertising purposes unless you contact management to say otherwise.

All contestants will receive a complimentary pool pass for having participated. 

The first building development around the hot springs can be dated back to 1907 when a man by the name of Mr Puckett purchased the land at a price of $2,000 per acre.

Maxime Goyou Beauchamps was also one of the winners of the annual contest held in Yukon, Canada

The site became a popular place for parties - containing a few small cabins, two barns, and a store.

Fast forward to present day and Andrew Umbrich and Lauren O'Coffey lease the hot springs to guests who want a unique experience. 

The venue hosts a number of themed events and discounts throughout the year, including mums go free on Mother's Day, and the same for dads on Father's Day.
