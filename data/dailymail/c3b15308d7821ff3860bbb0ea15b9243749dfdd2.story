A mother of two sons jailed for sex attacks has been sentenced to prison herself for five years for threatening to kill a woman her husband had raped.

Deborah Babic, 51, of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, called the victim late at night and said she would slit her throat if the woman testified against her 53-year-old husband Milan Babic.

Two months later she continued her attempts to stop her rapist husband going to jail by offering gifts to another of his eight victims, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court was told.

Milan Babic was jailed last September for
 life after he was convicted of 22 rapes, four attempted rapes, 13 
indecent assaults and one sexual assault, carried out over 30 years.

He blindfolded some of his victims and filmed the attacks and even persuaded his sons to take part in the savage rapes, the court heard.

His sons Mathue, 23, and Mikorlee, 17, were also jailed, for eight and three years respectively.

Mathue was found guilty of two counts of rape and one of attempted rape while his brother Mikorlee was sent to a young offenders institution after he was convicted of one count of rape.

On Monday their mother Deborah Babic was also sent to jail after she was found guilty of witness intimidation and perverting the course of justice.

Deborah Babic had made the call, along with co-defendant Kirsty Bryan, who was also living with the family, the court heard.

'If he (Milan Babic) goes to prison, you will be dead'

What Deborah Babic told victim

Neil Ahuja, prosecuting, said: ‘It was approaching midnight when the witness received a call. She recognised the voice of Deborah Babic who said, “If Milan gets remanded I will slit your throat”.

‘She put the phone on loud speaker and Kirsty Bryan shouted, “We will get you”. Deborah then said, “If he goes to prison, you will be dead”.’

Bryan, 22, of Porthill, Staffordshire, pleaded guilty to intimidation and was given a 12-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months.

Catherine O’Reilly, defending Deborah Babic, said her client, who has no previous convictions, maintains her innocence. David Jackson, defending Bryan, said she ‘foolishly’ became involved.

Judge David Fletcher told Deborah Babic her actions were ‘calculated to take advantage of her victims’ personalities’.

Speaking at the original trial in 
September, Judge Fletcher told Milan Babic: ‘Your actions had a 
devastating and totally life-changing effect on your victims. There is 
no remorse on your behalf.

'Deborah Babic now faces a lengthy spell behind bars as a result of her callous and despicable actions'

DS Steve Chadwick, Staffordshire Police

‘Over more than 30 years you committed hundreds, possibly thousands of offences.’

Following the case, Detective Sergeant Steve Chadwick, of Staffordshire Police, said: ‘Staffordshire Police are committed to protecting and supporting victims and witnesses of crime.

'Deborah Babic now faces a lengthy spell behind bars as a result of her callous and despicable actions. I would like to praise the courage and integrity of the victims who gave evidence on what were difficult and sensitive matters. 

'Persons who attempt to intimidate witnesses or interfere with the administration of justice will be dealt with robustly and swiftly. Staffordshire Police will actively seek to bring such persons to justice. '
