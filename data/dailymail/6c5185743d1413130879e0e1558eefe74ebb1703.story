When 12-year-old Kayla Roncin, Central New Jersey's star player for Toms River Little League baseball team, blasts a home run she makes sure to chant 'girl power' as she makes her way around the field.

But the first baseman, relief pitcher, spot starter and Toms River's best hitter won't have that chance for much longer. Kayla's baseball career has a 
shelf life, so she is reluctantly starting to get used to her future sport: softball.

'I know she can keep up with those boys,' her mom, Linda Roncin, told The New York Post. 'I don’t understand, why can’t a girl play baseball? Why is it a big deal?'

Kayla, who stands tall at 5ft and 8in, has been playing baseball since she was five years old, when her father, Ray, signed 
her up.

Toms River manager, Pete Avallone, says even then she was better than 95per cent of the boys, and his son, Tyler, an outfielder for Toms River, agrees.

'People don’t expect a girl to be 
playing baseball with a bunch of boys, and she’s one of the best on the 
team,' Tyler explained. 'She definitely surprises people with everything she does -- 
hitting, pitching and fielding.'

Pete Avallone admitted that when he picked Kayla -- who has a personal pitching coach and 
batting instructor -- for the team, her male teammates were initially 'shocked', but they quickly came around.

'People don't expect a girl to be playing baseball with a bunch of boys, and she's one of the best on the team,' said her teammate, Tyler. 'She surprises people with everything she does - hitting, pitching and fielding'

'She’s treated no differently than the 
boys on the team. They make fun of her and she gives it right back to 
them,' he explained.

However there are some players and coaches who laugh when Kayla walks onto the field - something that doesn't seen to rattle her, or her teammates.

'We’re happy, because we know for a fact
 she will prove them wrong and show them how good she is,' Tyler said.

'I think that motivates her to do better and prove them wrong. When they
 do that, we know she’s going to show them right up.'

Pete Avallone admitted that when he picked Kayla for the team four years ago, her male teammates were initially 'shocked' - but they quickly came around

Toms River is one of six teams 
in Bristol, Connecticut to make the Mid-Atlantic Regional --
 mainly thanks to Kayla. The fact she has just one more year left on the
 field before she will transition into Junior League Softball makes her 
'sad', she said, but she knows she must 'move on'.

'This could be my last time around, so
 I want to do the best I can. I really want to win it all so badly.'

Kayla's family has already begun looking into high level fast-pitch travel softball teams for Kayla, despite their reluctance to have her quit baseball.

'I think you’re taking the biggest part of her away if she has 
to [quit baseball],' said Linda. 'I can’t even, at this point, fathom that. She just 
loves the sport. I can’t even tell you how much, and if she’s not 
playing it, she’s watching it. That’s gonna be a really tough transition
 for her.'

Forty years ago, Little League Baseball allowed girls, for the first time, to participate in the world's largest organized youth sports program.

A 1973 ruling by Sylvia Pressler, hearing examiner for the New Jersey Civil Rights Division, was upheld in the New Jersey Superior Court a year later, leading to Little League Baseball's admittance of girls into its programs.

Until then, Little League regulations had prohibited girls from participating, and the World Series regulations even featured the clause: 'Girls are not eligible under any conditions.'

Now, approximately 150,000 girls play in Little League Baseball, and ten girls have participated in the Little League World Series.

However, there were only 859 girls playing high school baseball in 2010, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations.

Chelsea Baker, a 17-year-old junior at Durant High School in Plant City, Florida, hopes to be the third girl to be chosen for a college baseball team this year. 

In 2011, Marti Sementelli, from California, received a combination academic-baseball scholarship to Montreat College, which is part of the NCAA, in North Carolina.

And Ghazaleh Sailors, a junior pitcher and backup second baseman for the University of Maine-Presque Isle, is the only woman playing baseball in the NCAA in 2014.

Miss Sailors was forced to switch high schools after enduring harassment from her baseball teammates because of her gender. She told The Bangor Daily News earlier this year: 'I’ve gotten death threats over the internet. That was pretty scary.'

No woman has ever played in Major League Baseball.
